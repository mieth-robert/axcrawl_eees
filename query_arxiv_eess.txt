Title: Quantum-Embedded Dynamic Security Control using Hybrid Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Amin Masoumi, Mert Korkali
Abstract: Dynamic security control (DSC) is considered a pivotal step for the future power grid, which is increasingly penetrated by inverter-based resources. However, the efficiency of such practices, whether governed by automatic generation control or virtual inertia scheduling, can be intractable due to the complexity of the problem and the need to solve the differentialalgebraic equation in a timely manner with the required accuracy. In this regard, the model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm demonstrates reliable performance. In addition, the introduction of fault-tolerant and near-term quantum computing terminologies, i.e., noisy intermediate-scale quantum, opens avenues for improving the performance of model-free algorithms leveraging quantum capabilities. This paper provides an organized framework and assesses its dependability by evaluating the performance of a quantum-embedded algorithm on the DSC of the IEEE 39-bus test system. Hence, the obtained results demonstrate promising applications, along with shortcomings that can be addressed and further developed later.

Title: ReVeal-MT: A Physics-Informed Neural Network for Multi-Transmitter Radio Environment Mapping
Authors: Mukaram Shahid, Kunal Das, Hadia Ushaq, Hongwei Zhang, Jiming Song, Daji Qiao, Sarath Babu, Yong Guan, Zhengyuan Zhu, Arsalan Ahmad
Abstract: Accurately mapping the radio environment (e.g., identifying wireless signal strength at specific frequency bands and geographic locations) is crucial for efficient spectrum sharing, enabling Secondary Users~(SUs) to access underutilized spectrum bands while protecting Primary Users~(PUs). While existing models have made progress, they often degrade in performance when multiple transmitters coexist, due to the compounded effects of shadowing, interference from adjacent transmitters. To address this challenge, we extend our prior work on Physics-Informed Neural Networks~(PINNs) for single-transmitter mapping to derive a new multi-transmitter Partial Differential Equation~(PDE) formulation of the Received Signal Strength Indicator~(RSSI). We then propose \emph{ReVeal-MT} (Re-constructor and Visualizer of Spectrum Landscape for Multiple Transmitters), a novel PINN which integrates the multi-source PDE residual into a neural network loss function, enabling accurate spectrum landscape reconstruction from sparse RF sensor measurements. ReVeal-MT is validated using real-world measurements from the ARA wireless living lab across rural and suburban environments, and benchmarked against 3GPP and ITU-R channel models and a baseline PINN model for a single transmitter use-case. Results show that ReVeal-MT achieves substantial accuracy gains in multi-transmitter scenarios, e.g., achieving an RMSE of only 2.66\,dB with as few as 45 samples over a 370-square-kilometer region, while maintaining low computational complexity. These findings demonstrate that ReVeal-MT significantly advances radio environment mapping under realistic multi-transmitter conditions, with strong potential for enabling fine-grained spectrum management and precise coexistence between PUs and SUs.

Title: A Spatial Array for Spectrally Agile Wireless Processing
Authors: Ali Rasteh, Andrew Hennessee, Ishaan Shivhare, Siddharth Garg, Sundeep Rangan, Brandon Reagen
Abstract: Massive MIMO is a cornerstone of next-generation wireless communication, offering significant gains in capacity, reliability, and energy efficiency. However, to meet emerging demands such as high-frequency operation, wide bandwidths, co-existence, integrated sensing, and resilience to dynamic interference, future systems must exhibit both scalability and spectral agility. These requirements place increasing pressure on the underlying processing hardware to be both efficient and reconfigurable. This paper proposes a custom-designed spatial array architecture that serves as a reconfigurable, general-purpose core optimized for a class of wireless kernels that commonly arise in diverse communications and sensing tasks. The proposed spatial array is evaluated against specialized cores for each kernel using High-Level Synthesis (HLS). Both the reconfigurable and specialized designs are synthesized in a 32 nm process to assess latency, throughput, area, and power in realistic processes. The results identify conditions under which general-purpose systolic architectures can approach the efficiency of specialized cores, thereby paving the way toward more scalable and agile systems.

Title: PINN vs LSTM: A Comparative Study for Steam Temperature Control in Heat Recovery Steam Generators
Authors: Mojtaba Fanoodi, Farzaneh Abdollahi, Mahdi Aliyari Shoorehdeli
Abstract: This paper introduces a direct comparative study of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for adaptive steam temperature control in Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSGs), particularly under valve leakage faults. Maintaining precise steam temperature in HRSGs is critical for efficiency and safety, yet traditional control strategies struggle with nonlinear, fault-induced dynamics. Both architectures are designed to adaptively tune the gains of a PI-plus-feedforward control law in real-time. The LSTM controller, a purely data-driven approach, was trained offline on historical operational data, while the PINN controller integrates fundamental thermodynamic laws directly into its online learning process through a physics-based loss function. Their performance was evaluated using a model validated with data from a combined cycle power plant, under normal load changes and a challenging valve leakage fault scenario. Results demonstrate that while the LSTM controller offers significant improvement over conventional methods, its performance degrades under the unseen fault. The PINN controller consistently delivered superior robustness and performance, achieving a 54\% reduction in integral absolute error compared to the LSTM under fault conditions. This study concludes that embedding physical knowledge into data-driven control is essential for developing reliable, fault-tolerant autonomous control systems in complex industrial applications.

Title: Configuration-Constrained Tube MPC for Periodic Operation
Authors: Filippo Badalamenti, Jose A. Borja-Conde, Sampath Kumar Mulagaleti, Boris Houska, Alberto Bemporad, Mario Eduardo Villanueva
Abstract: Periodic operation often emerges as the economically optimal mode in industrial processes, particularly under varying economic or environmental conditions. This paper proposes a robust model predictive control (MPC) framework for uncertain systems modeled as polytopic linear differential inclusions (LDIs), where the dynamics evolve as convex combinations of finitely many affine control systems with additive disturbances. The robust control problem is reformulated as a convex optimization program by optimizing over configuration-constrained polytopic tubes and tracks a periodic trajectory that is optimal for a given economic criterion. Artificial variables embedded in the formulation ensure recursive feasibility and robust constraint satisfaction when the economic criterion is updated online, while guaranteeing convergence to the corresponding optimal periodic tube when the criterion remains constant. To improve computational efficiency, we introduce a quadratic over-approximation of the periodic cost under a Lipschitz continuity assumption, yielding a Quadratic Program (QP) formulation that preserves the above theoretical guarantees. The effectiveness and scalability of the approach are demonstrated on a benchmark example and a ball-plate system with eight states.

Title: Stability of Lyapunov redesign trajectory tracking control with unbounded perturbations -- A tube-based stability analysis
Authors: Niclas Titze, Kai Wulff, Johann Reger
Abstract: Considering a nonlinear system in Byrnes-Isidori form that is subject to unbounded perturbations, we apply Lyapunov redesign via feedback linearisation for trajectory tracking. Leveraging the ideas of tube-based geometric characterisation of the invariance properties of the closed loop, we generalise the classical stability criterion from the~literature from constant to nonconstant reference trajectories. The proposed analysis is tailored to the Lyapunov redesign and the tracking problem insofar as we incorporate the reference trajectory and the transient decrease of the tracking error enforced by the controller. In particular, we exploit that the Lyapunov function of the tracking error satisfies a differential inequality, thereby guaranteeing that the solution of the closed loop remains in a contracting tube along the reference trajectory.

Title: Learning Beamforming for Pinching Antenna System-Enabled ISAC in Low-Altitude Wireless Networks
Authors: Jia Guo, Yuanwei Liu, Arumugam Nallanathan
Abstract: This work investigates the joint learning of pinching antenna (PA) positions and transmit beamforming for PA-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in the low-altitude wireless networks. By freely deploying antenna positions along waveguides, the pinching antenna system effectively mitigates the impact of path loss and thus enhances the capacities of sensing and communicating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that fly over a large range. We first model the problem of maximizing the sensing performance of multiple targets while satisfying the communication performance requirements of multiple users, where both the targets and users are UAVs. For mitigating in-waveguide attenuation and improving sensing performance, the segmented waveguide-enabled pinching antenna (SWAN) system is adopted. Furthermore, an alternative optimization (AO) algorithm for SWAN-based ISAC (SWISAC-AO) is developed, where the optimal structure of the transmit beamforming solution is derived. A graph neural network (GNN), termed SWISAC-GNN, is then proposed to jointly learn PA positions and transmit beamforming, with its alternative update procedure inspired by the SWISAC-AO algorithm. Numerical results show that the GNN achieves sensing performance comparable to or better than the AO algorithm while better satisfying communication requirements. Moreover, the SWISAC-GNN is with much lower implementation complexity, enabling real-time deployment.

Title: A Mixed Precision FFT with applications in MRI
Authors: Nikhil Deveshwar, Abhejit Rajagopal, Peder E. Z. Larson
Abstract: A mixed precision Fast Fourier transform (FFT) implementation is presented. The procedure uses per-block microscaling (MX), a global power-of-two prescale, and prequantized low bit twiddles. We evaluate forward and round-trip FFT fidelity on two public MRI datasets and compare the effect of various low precision formats, image sizes, and MX block sizes on image quality. Results show that mantissa precision is the primary limiter under MX scaling while ablations suggest weak dependence on image size but a clear block-size trade-off with larger block sizes resulting in better numerical performance.

Title: RRAM-Based Analog Matrix Computing for Massive MIMO Signal Processing: A Review
Authors: Pushen Zuo, Zhong Sun
Abstract: Resistive random-access memory (RRAM) provides an excellent platform for analog matrix computing (AMC), enabling both matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) and the solution of matrix equations through open-loop and closed-loop circuit architectures. While RRAM-based AMC has been widely explored for accelerating neural networks, its application to signal processing in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication is rapidly emerging as a promising direction. In this Review, we summarize recent advances in applying AMC to massive MIMO, including DFT/IDFT computation for OFDM modulation and demodulation using MVM circuits; MIMO detection and precoding using MVM-based iterative algorithms; and rapid one-step solutions enabled by matrix inversion (INV) and generalized inverse (GINV) circuits. We also highlight additional opportunities, such as AMC-based compressed-sensing recovery for channel estimation and eigenvalue circuits for leakage-based precoding. Finally, we outline key challenges, including RRAM device reliability, analog circuit precision, array scalability, and data conversion bottlenecks, and discuss the opportunities for overcoming these barriers. With continued progress in device-circuit-algorithm co-design, RRAM-based AMC holds strong promise for delivering high-efficiency, high-reliability solutions to (ultra)massive MIMO signal processing in the 6G era.

Title: Probabilistic Dynamic Line Rating with Line Graph Convolutional LSTM
Authors: Minsoo Kim, Vladimir Dvorkin, Jip Kim
Abstract: Dynamic line rating (DLR) is an effective approach to enhancing the utilization of existing transmission line infrastructure by adapting line ratings according to real-time weather conditions. Accurate DLR forecasts are essential for grid operators to effectively schedule generation, manage transmission congestion, and lower operating costs. As renewable generation becomes increasingly variable and weather-dependent, accurate DLR forecasts are also crucial for improving renewable utilization and reducing curtailment during congested periods. Deterministic forecasts, however, often inadequately represent actual line capacities under uncertain weather conditions, leading to operational risks and costly real-time adjustments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel network-wide probabilistic DLR forecasting model that leverages both spatial and temporal information, significantly reducing the operational risks and inefficiencies inherent in deterministic methods. Case studies on a synthetic Texas 123-bus system demonstrate that the proposed method not only enhances grid reliability by effectively capturing true DLR values, but also substantially reduces operational costs.

Title: Towards 6G Native-AI Edge Networks: A Semantic-Aware and Agentic Intelligence Paradigm
Authors: Chenyuan Feng, Anbang Zhang, Geyong Min, Yongming Huang, Tony Q. S. Quek, Xiaohu You
Abstract: The evolution toward sixth-generation wireless systems positions intelligence as a native network capability, fundamentally transforming the design of radio access networks (RANs). Within this vision, Semantic-native communication and agentic intelligence are expected to play central roles. SemCom departs from bit-level fidelity and instead emphasizes task-oriented meaning exchange, enabling compact SC and introducing new performance measures such as semantic fidelity and task success rate. Agentic intelligence endows distributed RAN entities with goal-driven autonomy, reasoning, planning, and multi-agent collaboration, increasingly supported by foundation models and knowledge graphs. In this work, we first introduce the conceptual foundations of SemCom and agentic networking, and discuss why existing AI-driven O-RAN solutions remain largely bit-centric and task-siloed. We then present a unified taxonomy that organizes recent research along three axes: i) semantic abstraction level (symbol/feature/intent/knowledge), ii) agent autonomy and coordination granularity (single-, multi-, and hierarchical-agent), and iii) RAN control placement across PHY/MAC, near-real-time RIC, and non-real-time RIC. Based on this taxonomy, we systematically introduce enabling technologies including task-oriented semantic encoders/decoders, multi-agent reinforcement learning, foundation-model-assisted RAN agents, and knowledge-graph-based reasoning for cross-layer awareness. Representative 6G use cases, such as immersive XR, vehicular V2X, and industrial digital twins, are analyzed to illustrate the semantic-agentic convergence in practice. Finally, we identify open challenges in semantic representation standardization, scalable trustworthy agent coordination, O-RAN interoperability, and energy-efficient AI deployment, and outline research directions toward operational semantic-agentic AI-RAN.

Title: Enabling Fast Polar SC Decoding with IR-HARQ
Authors: Marwan Jalaleddine, Mohamad Ali Jarkas, Jiajie Li, Warren J. Gross
Abstract: To extend the applications of polar codes within next-generation wireless communication systems, it is essential to incorporate support for Incremental Redundancy (IR) Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) schemes. For very high- throughput applications, Successive Cancellation (SC) decoding is particularly appealing for polar codes owing to its high area efficiency. In this paper, we propose modifications to SC decoders that employ special nodes to accelerate decoding. Our modifications enable the use of polar IR-HARQ with SC decoding for high throughput applications. Compared to the unmodified SC IR-HARQ scheme, our proposed approach allows us to achieve a 72% reduction in node traversals with a polar code of length 2048. Simulation results confirm that the proposed special node modifications do not cause any degradation in FER performance.

Title: Quantum-Accelerated Deep Reinforcement Learning for Frequency Regulation Enhancement
Authors: Amin Masoumi, Mert Korkali
Abstract: In modern power systems, frequency regulation is a fundamental prerequisite for ensuring system reliability and assessing the robustness of expansion projects. Conventional feedback control schemes, however, exhibit limited accuracy under varying operating conditions because their gains remain static. Consequently, deep reinforcement learning methods are increasingly employed to design adaptive controllers that can be generalized to diverse frequency control tasks. At the same time, recent advances in quantum computing provide avenues for embedding quantum capabilities into such critical applications. In particular, the potential of quantum algorithms can be more effectively explored and harnessed on near-term quantum devices by leveraging insights from active controller design. In this work, we incorporate a quantum circuit together with an ansatz into the operation of a deep deterministic policy gradient agent. The simulation results of the IEEE 14-bus test system demonstrate the potential of this integrated approach that can achieve reliable, robust performance across diverse real-world challenges.

Title: Optimizing DER Aggregate Flexibility via Network Reconfiguration
Authors: Feixiang Zhang, Hongyi Li, Bai Cui, Zhaoyu Wang
Abstract: The aggregate flexibility region of distributed energy resources (DERs) quantifies the aggregate power shaping capabilities of DERs. It characterizes the distribution network's potential for wholesale market participation and grid service provision at the transmission level. To enhance flexibility and fully exploit the potential of DERs, this paper proposes a method to optimize the aggregate flexibility region through distribution network reconfiguration. First, we formulate the ellipsoidal aggregate flexibility region characterization problem as a two-stage adaptive robust optimization problem and derive an exact convex reformulation with a large number of second-order cone constraints. By exploiting the problem structure, we propose a scalable Benders decomposition algorithm with provable finite convergence to the optimal solution. Finally, we propose an optimal reconfiguration problem for aggregate flexibility region optimization and solve it using the custom Benders decomposition. Numerical simulations on the IEEE 123-bus test feeder demonstrate that, compared to existing approaches, substantial improvements in the aggregate flexibility region can be achieved over multiple scenarios with the optimized topology.

Title: Adaptive Time-Domain Harmonic Control for Noise-Vibration-Harshness Reduction of Electric Drives
Authors: Klaus Herburger, Fabian Jakob, David Gänzle, Maximilian Manderla, Andrea Iannelli
Abstract: Reducing Noise, Vibration, and Harshness (NVH) in electric drives is crucial for applications such as electric vehicle drivetrains and heat-pump compressors, where strict NVH requirements directly affect user satisfaction and component longevity. This work presents the integration of an adaptive time-domain harmonic controller into an existing electric-drive control loop to attenuate harmonic disturbances. Three control structures are proposed and analyzed, along with a modified parameter-estimation scheme that reduces computational effort while preserving estimation accuracy, making the method suitable for embedded real-time implementation. To cope with fast operating-point changes, a delta-learning approach combines adaptive control with a lookup-table-based feedforward estimator, ensuring fast convergence and robustness. The proposed controller architectures are validated through simulation and testbench experiments on a permanent-magnet synchronous machine drive, demonstrating substantial NVH reductions across operating conditions. The results confirm that time-domain adaptive harmonic control offers a practical and theoretically grounded solution for real-time NVH mitigation in electric drives.

Title: Efficient Safety Verification of Autonomous Vehicles with Neural Network Operator
Authors: Lingxiang Fan, Linxuan He, Haoyuan Ji, Shuo Feng
Abstract: When autonomous vehicles encounter untrained scenarios, ensuring safety hinges on effective safety verification to prevent accidents stemming from unexpected model decisions. Reachability analysis, a method of safety verification, offers relatively high precision but at the cost of significant computational complexity. Our method leverages end-to-end neural network operators to compute reachable sets, replacing traditional mathematical set operators, thereby achieving higher efficiency in safety verification without substantially compromising accuracy or increasing conservativeness. We define vehicle dynamics on discrete time series and detail the safety verification process and safety standard based on reachable sets. Experimental evaluations conducted in several typical road driving scenarios demonstrate the superior efficiency performance of our proposed operator over classical methods.

Title: Adapt and Stabilize, Then Learn and Optimize: A New Approach to Adaptive LQR
Authors: Peter A. Fisher, Anuradha M. Annaswamy
Abstract: This paper focuses on adaptive control of the discrete-time linear quadratic regulator (adaptive LQR). Recent literature has made significant contributions in proving non-asymptotic convergence rates, but existing approaches have a few drawbacks that pose barriers for practical implementation. These drawbacks include (i) a requirement of an initial stabilizing controller, (ii) a reliance on exploration for closed-loop stability, and/or (iii) computationally intensive algorithms. This paper proposes a new algorithm that overcomes these drawbacks for a particular class of discrete-time systems. This algorithm leverages direct Model-Reference Adaptive Control (direct MRAC) and combines it with an epoch-based approach in order to address the drawbacks (i)-(iii) with a provable high-probability regret bound comparable to existing literature. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach yields regrets that are comparable to those from existing methods when the conditions (i) and (ii) are met, and yields regrets that are significantly smaller when either of these two conditions is not met.

Title: Gauss-Newton accelerated MPPI Control
Authors: Hannes Homburger, Katrin Baumgärtner, Moritz Diehl, Johannes Reuter
Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control is a sampling-based optimization method that has recently attracted attention, particularly in the robotics and reinforcement learning communities. MPPI has been widely applied as a GPU-accelerated random search method to deterministic direct single-shooting optimal control problems arising in model predictive control (MPC) formulations. MPPI offers several key advantages, including flexibility, robustness, ease of implementation, and inherent parallelizability. However, its performance can deteriorate in high-dimensional settings since the optimal control problem is solved via Monte Carlo sampling. To address this limitation, this paper proposes an enhanced MPPI method that incorporates a Jacobian reconstruction technique and the second-order Generalized Gauss-Newton method. This novel approach is called \textit{Gauss-Newton accelerated MPPI}. The numerical results show that the Gauss-Newton accelerated MPPI approach substantially improves MPPI scalability and computational efficiency while preserving the key benefits of the classical MPPI framework, making it a promising approach even for high-dimensional problems.

Title: Structure-Aware Adaptive Kernel MPPCA Denoising for Diffusion MRI
Authors: Ananya Singhal, Dattesh Dayanand Shanbhag, Sudhanya Chatterjee
Abstract: Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) at high b-values often suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), making image quality poor. Marchenko-Pastur PCA (MPPCA) is a popular method to reduce noise, but it uses a fixed patch size across the whole image, which doesn't work well in regions with different structures. To address this, we propose an adaptive kernel MPPCA (ak-MPPCA) that selects the best patch size for each voxel based on its local neighborhood. This improves denoising performance by better handling structural variations.

Title: Nonlinear EM-based Signal Processing
Authors: Mattia Fabiani, Giulia Torcolacci, Davide Dardari
Abstract: The use of high-frequency bands, combined with antenna arrays containing an extremely large number of elements (XL-MIMO), is pushing current technology to its limits in terms of hardware complexity, latency, and power consumption. A promising approach to achieving scalable and sustainable solutions is to shift part of the signal processing directly into the electromagnetic (EM) domain. In this paper, we investigate novel architectures that harness the interaction of reconfigurable passive linear and nonlinear (NL) scattering elements positioned in the reactive near field of signal sources. The objective is to enable multifunctional linear and NL EM signal processing to occur directly "over-the-air." Numerical results highlight the potential to significantly reduce both system complexity and the number of RF chains, while still achieving key performance metrics in applications such as direction-of-arrival and position estimation, without the need for additional analog or digital processing.

Title: Strategies for zero boil-off liquid hydrogen transfer: an export terminal case-study
Authors: Halvor Aarnes Krog, David Berstad
Abstract: To ensure economic viability, LH2 export terminals must minimize boil-off losses. We show two strategies to achieve zero boil-off losses for the transfer of 160 000 m3 LH2 (11 248 tons) using a centrifugal pump. In the first strategy, a pump with variable speed drive (VSD) and split-range control for the flow rate achieves losses from 0 wt% to 0.24 wt% in an uncertainty analysis. A pump efficiency approaching 70% is the most important factor to minimize losses. In contrast, a fixed-speed pump has unacceptably high losses ranging from 0.76 wt% to 1.06 wt% (119 tons per ship). The second strategy is to increase the maximum pressure in the seaborne tank (base case is 1.15 bara). Zero loss is achieved for the fixed speed pump if the maximum pressure is increased to 1.35 bara, while 1.22 bara is required for the pump with VSD assuming an efficiency of 60%.

Title: Auto-Optimization with Active Learning in Uncertain Environment: A Predictive Control Approach
Authors: Yuan Tan, Jun Yang, Zhongguo Li, Wen-Hua Chen, Shihua Li
Abstract: This paper presents an auto-optimal model predictive control (MPC) framework enhanced with active learning, designed to autonomously track optimal operational conditions in an unknown environment,where the conditions may dynamically adjust to environmental changes. First, an exploitation-oriented MPC (EO-MPC) is proposed, integrating real-time sampling data with robust set-based parameter estimation techniques to address the critical challenge of parameter identification. By introducing virtual excitation signals into the terminal constraint and establishing a validation mechanism for persistent excitation condition, the EO-MPC effectively resolves the issue of insufficient persistent excitation in parameter identification. Building upon this foundation, an active learning MPC (AL-MPC) approach is developed to integrate both available and virtual future data to resolve the fundamental conflict between tracking an unknown optimal operational condition and parameter identification. The recursive feasibility and convergence of the proposed methods are rigorously established, and numerous examples substantiate the reliability and effectiveness of the approach in practical applications.

Title: A Unified Low-rank ADI Framework with Shared Linear Solves for Simultaneously Solving Multiple Lyapunov, Sylvester, and Riccati Equations
Authors: Umair Zulfiqar, Zhong-Yi Huang
Abstract: It is known in the literature that the low-rank ADI method for Lyapunov equations is a Petrov-Galerkin projection algorithm that implicitly performs model order reduction. In this paper, we show that the low-rank ADI methods for Sylvester and Riccati equations are also Petrov-Galerkin projection algorithms that implicitly perform model order reduction. By observing that the ADI methods for Lyapunov, Sylvester, and Riccati equations differ only in pole placement and not in their interpolatory nature, we show that the shifted linear solves-which constitute the bulk of the computational cost-can be shared. The pole-placement step involves only small-scale operations and is therefore inexpensive. We propose a unified ADI framework that requires only two shifted linear solves per iteration to simultaneously solve six Lyapunov equations, one Sylvester equation, and ten Riccati equations, thus substantially increasing the return on investment for the computational cost spent on the linear solves. All operations needed to extract the individual solutions from these shared linear solves are small-scale and inexpensive. Since all ADI methods implicitly perform model order reduction when solving these linear matrix equations, we show that the resulting reduced-order models can be obtained as an additional byproduct. These models not only interpolate the original transfer function at the mirror images of the ADI shifts but also preserve important system properties such as stability, minimum-phase property, positive-realness, bounded-realness, and passivity. Consequently, the proposed unified ADI framework also serves as a recursive, interpolation-based model order reduction method, which can preserve several important properties of the original model in the reduced-order model.

Title: Multi Task Denoiser Training for Solving Linear Inverse Problems
Authors: Clément Bled, François Pitié
Abstract: Plug-and-Play Priors (PnP) and Regularisation by Denoising (RED) have established that image denoisers can effectively replace traditional regularisers in linear inverse problem solvers for tasks like super-resolution, demosaicing, and inpainting. It is now well established in the literature that a denoiser's residual links to the gradient of the image log prior (Miyasawa and Tweedie), enabling iterative, gradient ascent-based image generation (e.g., diffusion models), as well as new methods for solving inverse problems. Building on this, we propose enhancing Kadkhodaie and Simoncelli's gradient-based inverse solvers by fine-tuning the denoiser within the iterative solving process itself. Training the denoiser end-to-end across the solver framework and simultaneously across multiple tasks yields a single, versatile denoiser optimised for inverse problems. We demonstrate that even a simple baseline model fine-tuned this way achieves an average PSNR improvement of +1.34 dB across six diverse inverse problems while reducing the required iterations. Furthermore, we analyse the fine-tuned denoiser's properties, finding that its optimisation objective implicitly shifts from minimising standard denoising error (MMSE) towards approximating an ideal prior gradient specifically tailored for guiding inverse recovery.

Title: Pinching-Antenna System Design under Random LoS and NLoS Channels
Authors: Yanqing Xu, Yang Lu, Zhiguo Ding, Tsung-Hui Chang
Abstract: Pinching antennas, realized through position-adjustable radiating elements along dielectric waveguides, have emerged as a promising flexible-antenna technology thanks to their ability to dynamically reshape large-scale channel conditions. However, most existing studies focus on idealized LoS-dominated environments, overlooking the stochastic nature of realistic wireless propagation. This paper investigates a more practical multiuser pinching-antenna system under a composite probabilistic channel model that captures distance-dependent LoS blockage and NLoS scattering. To account for both efficiency and reliability aspects of communication, two complementary design metrics are considered: an average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) metric characterizing long-term throughput and fairness, and an outage-constrained metric ensuring a prescribed reliability level. Based on these metrics, we formulate two optimization problems: the first maximizes the max-min average SNR across users, while the second maximizes a guaranteed SNR threshold under per-user outage constraints. Although both problems are inherently nonconvex, we exploit their underlying monotonic structures and develop low-complexity, bisection-based algorithms that achieve globally optimal solutions using only simple scalar evaluations. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and demonstrate that pinching-antenna systems significantly outperform conventional fixed-antenna designs even under random LoS and NLoS channels.

Title: CIG-MAE: Cross-Modal Information-Guided Masked Autoencoder for Self-Supervised WiFi Sensing
Authors: Gang Liu, Yanling Hao, Yixuan Zou
Abstract: Human Action Recognition using WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) has emerged as an attractive alternative to vision-based methods due to its ubiquity, device-agnostic nature, and inherent privacy-preserving capabilities. However, the high cost of manual annotation and the limited scale of publicly available CSI datasets restrict the performance of supervised approaches. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising avenue, but existing contrastive paradigms rely on data augmentations that conflict with the physical semantics of radio signals and require large-batch training, making them poorly suited for CSI. To overcome these challenges, we introduce CIG-MAE -- a Cross-modal Information-Guided Masked Autoencoder -- that reconstructs both the amplitude and phase of CSI using a symmetric dual-stream architecture with a high masking ratio. Specifically, we propose an Adaptive Information-Guided Masking strategy that dynamically allocates attention to time-frequency regions with high information density to improve learning efficiency, and incorporate a Barlow Twins regularizer to align cross-modal representations without negative samples. Experiments on three public datasets show that CIG-MAE consistently outperforms SOTA SSL methods and even surpasses a fully supervised baseline, demonstrating superior data efficiency, robustness, and representation generalization.

Title: Secret Key Generation on Aerial Rician Fading Channels Against a Curious Receiver
Authors: Mattia Piana, Stefano Tomasin
Abstract: Secret key generation at the physical layer is expected to be a fundamental enabler for next-generation networks. We consider a network where the user equipment is a drone and propose a novel secret key generation solution when the eavesdropper is another node belonging to the network (curious device). We exploit drone mobility over realistic Rician fading channels. In our protocol, after a prior training phase, drone Alice chooses a trajectory of positions in space and transmits a message to Bob, on the ground, from each position. From the received messages, Bob estimates the channel gain from which a secret key is extracted. The choice of the positions is made to maximize a lower bound on the secret key capacity. Numerical simulations are used to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Title: Pick-to-Learn for Systems and Control: Data-driven Synthesis with State-of-the-art Safety Guarantees
Authors: Dario Paccagnan, Daniel Marks, Marco C. Campi, Simone Garatti
Abstract: Data-driven methods have become paramount in modern systems and control problems characterized by growing levels of complexity. In safety-critical environments, deploying these methods requires rigorous guarantees, a need that has motivated much recent work at the interface of statistical learning and control. However, many existing approaches achieve this goal at the cost of sacrificing valuable data for testing and calibration, or by constraining the choice of learning algorithm, thus leading to suboptimal performances. In this paper, we describe Pick-to-Learn (P2L) for Systems and Control, a framework that allows any data-driven control method to be equipped with state-of-the-art safety and performance guarantees. P2L enables the use of all available data to jointly synthesize and certify the design, eliminating the need to set aside data for calibration or validation purposes. In presenting a comprehensive version of P2L for systems and control, this paper demonstrates its effectiveness across a range of core problems, including optimal control, reachability analysis, safe synthesis, and robust control. In many of these applications, P2L delivers designs and certificates that outperform commonly employed methods, and shows strong potential for broad applicability in diverse practical settings.

Title: Towards predicting binaural audio quality in listeners with normal and impaired hearing
Authors: Thomas Biberger, Stephan D. Ewert
Abstract: Eurich et al. (2024) recently introduced the computationally efficient monaural and binaural audio quality model (eMoBi-Q). This model integrates both monaural and binaural auditory features and has been validated across six audio datasets encompassing quality ratings for music and speech, processed via algorithms commonly employed in modern hearing devices (e.g., acoustic transparency, feedback cancellation, and binaural beamforming) or presented via loudspeakers. In the current study, we expand eMoBi-Q to account for perceptual effects of sensorineural hearing loss (HL) on audio quality. For this, the model was extended by a nonlinear auditory filterbank. Given that altered loudness perception is a prevalent issue among listeners with hearing impairment, our goal is to incorporate loudness as a sub-dimension for predicting audio quality in both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired populations. While predicting loudness itself is important in the context of loudness-based hearing aid fitting, loudness as audio quality sub-measure may be helpful for the selection of reliable auditory features in hearing impaired listeners. The parameters of the filterbank and subsequent processing stages were informed by the physiologically-based (binaural) loudness model proposed by Pieper et al. (2018). This study presents and discusses the initial implementation of the extended binaural quality model.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been recognized as a key technology in sixth-generation wireless networks, and the additional spatial degrees of freedom obtained by movable antenna (MA) technology can significantly improve the performance of ISAC systems. This paper considers an ISAC-assisted vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) network, where extended kalman filter-based prediction is combined with real-time optimization to jointly optimize transmit antenna positions and beamforming and power allocation vectors in dynamic environments. We propose two algorithms: a preprocessing-schur complement-projected gradient ascent algorithm for scenarios without sensing quality of service (QoS) constraints, which explores the potential range of sensing performance to provide reference and warm-starting for subsequent constrained optimization; and a heuristic reflective projected dynamic particle swarm optimization algorithm for sensing QoS-constrained scenarios, which achieves substantial performance gains under non-convex constraints with a small number of iterations. Simulation results demonstrate that these approaches enhance both the communication sum-rate and the lower of the Cramér-Rao lower bound of motion parameter estimation, validating the effectiveness of MA-assisted beamforming in dynamic V2I ISAC networks.

Title: Constrained Control of PDE Traffic Flow via Spatial Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Brian Block, Stephanie Stockar
Abstract: In this paper, a constrained control approach to variable speed limit (VSL) control for macroscopic partial differential equations (PDE) traffic models is developed. Control Lyapunov function (CLF) theory for ordinary differential equations (ODE) is extended to account for spatially and temporally varying states and control inputs. The stabilizing CLF is then unified with safety constraints through the introduction of spatially varying control barrier functions (sCBF). These methods are applied to in-domain VSL control of the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model to regulate traffic density to a desired profile while ensuring the density remains below prescribed limits enforced by the sCBF. Results show that incorporating constrained control minimally affects the stabilizing control input while successfully maintaining the density with the defined safe set.

Title: Counterfactual Explanations for Power System Optimisation
Authors: Benjamin Fritz, Waqquas Bukhsh
Abstract: Enhanced computational capabilities of modern decision-making software have allowed us to solve increasingly sophisticated optimisation problems. But in complex socio-economic, technical environments such as electricity markets, transparent operation is key to ensure a fair treatment of all parties involved, particularly regarding dispatch decisions. We address this issue by building on the concept of counterfactual explanations, answering questions such as "Why was this generator not dispatched?" by identifying minimum changes in the input parameters that would have changed the optimal solution. Both DC Optimal Power Flow and Unit Commitment problems are considered, wherein the variable parameters are the spatial and temporal demand profiles, respectively. The thereby obtained explanations allow users to identify the most important differences between the real and expected market outcomes and observe which constraints have led to the solution. The framework uses a bilevel optimisation problem to find the counterfactual demand scenarios. State-of-the-art methods are compared with data-driven heuristics on the basis of computational efficiency and explanation accuracy. Results show that leveraging historical data from previously solved instances can provide significant speed benefits and allows us to derive explanations in cases where conventional methods would not be tractable.

Title: Safe model-based Reinforcement Learning via Model Predictive Control and Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Kerim Dzhumageldyev, Filippo Airaldi, Azita Dabiri
Abstract: Optimal control strategies are often combined with safety certificates to ensure both performance and safety in safety-critical systems. A prominent example is combining Model Predictive Control (MPC) with Control Barrier Functions (CBF). Yet, efficient tuning of MPC parameters and choosing an appropriate class $\mathcal{K}$ function in the CBF is challenging and problem dependent. This paper introduces a safe model-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework where a parametric MPC controller incorporates a CBF constraint with a parameterized class $\mathcal{K}$ function and serves as a function approximator to learn improved safe control policies from data. Three variations of the framework are introduced, distinguished by the way the optimization problem is formulated and the class $\mathcal{K}$ function is parameterized, including neural architectures. Numerical experiments on a discrete double-integrator with static and dynamic obstacles demonstrate that the proposed methods improve performance while ensuring safety.

Title: Cute but Cunning: Effective Closed-Form Alternatives to the Exact Lognormal Statistics
Authors: Carlos Rafael Nogueira da Silva, Maria Cecilia Luna Alvarado, Fernando Darío Almeida García, Michel Daoud Yacoub
Abstract: The Lognormal distribution is a fundamental statistical model widely used in different fields of science, including biology, finance, economics, engineering, etc. In wireless communications, it is the primary statistic for large-scale fading modeling. However, its known analytical intractability presents persistent channel characterization and performance analysis challenges. This paper introduces two effective and mathematically tractable surrogate models for the Lognormal distribution, constructed from the product of Nakagami-$m$ and Inverse Nakagami-$m$ (I-Nakagami-$m$) variates. These models yield asymptotically exact closed-form expressions for key performance metrics -- including the characteristic function, bit error rate, and Shannon's capacity -- and enable analytically tractable expressions for the probability density function and cumulative distribution function of the composite $\alpha$-$\mu$-Lognormal fading model. To facilitate implementation, a moment-matching framework is developed to map the Lognormal parameters to the surrogate model parameters. In addition, a random mixture approach is proposed to enhance convergence by exploiting the complementary approximation properties of the Nakagami-$m$ and I-Nakagami-$m$ distributions. The methodology is further extended to heterogeneous cascaded fading channels comprising arbitrary combinations of $\alpha$-$\mu$, $\kappa$-$\mu$, and $\eta$-$\mu$ variates, for which moment-based mappings to the equivalent Lognormal distributions are derived. Numerical results confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach, positioning it as a practical and reliable alternative to exact Lognormal statistics.

Title: Beampattern Synthesis for Discrete Phase RIS in Communication and Sensing Systems
Authors: Xiao Cai, Hei Victor Cheng, Daniel E. Lucani
Abstract: Extensive research on Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) has primarily focused on optimizing reflective coefficients for passive beamforming in specific target directions. This optimization typically assumes prior knowledge of the target direction, which is unavailable before the target is detected. To enhance direction estimation, it is critical to develop array pattern synthesis techniques that yield a wider beam by maximizing the received power over the entire target area. Although this challenge has been addressed with active antennas, RIS systems pose a unique challenge due to their inherent phase constraints, which can be continuous or discrete. This work addresses this challenge through a novel array pattern synthesis method tailored for discrete phase constraints in RIS. We introduce a penalty method that pushes these constraints to the boundary of the convex hull. Then, the Minorization-Maximization (MM) method is utilized to reformulate the problem into a convex one. Our numerical results show that our algorithm can generate a wide beam pattern comparable to that achievable with per-power constraints, with both the amplitudes and phases being adjustable. We compare our method with a traditional beam sweeping technique, showing a) several orders of magnitude reduction of the MSE of Angle of Arrival (AOA) at low to medium Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)s; and b) $8$~dB SNR reduction to achieve a high probability of detection.

Title: Stability-Guaranteed Dual Kalman Filtering for Electrochemical Battery State Estimation
Authors: Feng Guo, Guangdi Hu, Keyi Liao, Luis D. Couto, Khiem Trad, Ru Hong, Hamid Hamed, Mohammadhosein Safari
Abstract: Accurate and stable state estimation is critical for battery management. Although dual Kalman filtering can jointly estimate states and parameters, the strong coupling between filters may cause divergence under large initialization errors or model mismatch. This paper proposes a Stability Guaranteed Dual Kalman Filtering (SG-DKF) method. A Lyapunov-based analysis yields a sufficient stability condition, leading to an adaptive dead-zone rule that suspends parameter updates when the innovation exceeds a stability bound. Applied to an electrochemical battery model, SG-DKF achieves accuracy comparable to a dual EKF and reduces state of charge RMSE by over 45% under large initial state errors.

Title: Small-Signal Stability Oriented Real-Time Operation of Power Systems with a High Penetration of Inverter-Based Resources
Authors: Francesca Rossi, Juan Carlos Olives-Camps, Eduardo Prieto-Araujo, Oriol Gomis-Bellmunt
Abstract: This study proposes a control strategy to ensure the safe operation of modern power systems with high penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) within an optimal operation framework. The objective is to obtain operating points that satisfy the optimality conditions of a predefined problem while guaranteeing small-signal stability. The methodology consists of two stages. First, an offline analysis of a set of operating points is performed to derive a data-driven regression-based expression that captures a damping-based stability index as a function of the operating conditions. Second, an Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) controller is employed to drive the system toward an optimal operating point while maintaining a secure distance from the instability region. The proposed strategy is evaluated on an academic test case based on a modified version of the IEEE 9-bus system, in which synchronous generators are replaced by IBRs operating under both grid-following and grid-forming control modes. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method and are discussed in detail.

Title: Channel-Aware Multi-Domain Feature Extraction for Automatic Modulation Recognition in MIMO Systems
Authors: Yunpeng Qu, Yazhou Sun, Bingyu Hui, Jintao Wang, Jian Wang
Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is a key technology in non-cooperative communication systems, aiming to identify the modulation scheme from signals without prior information. Deep learning (DL)-based methods have gained wide attention due to their excellent performance, but research mainly focuses on single-input single-output (SISO) systems, with limited exploration for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The confounding effects of multi-antenna channels can interfere with the statistical properties of MIMO signals, making identification particularly challenging. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Channel-Aware Multi-Domain feature extraction (CAMD) framework for AMR in MIMO systems. Our CAMD framework reconstructs the transmitted signal through an efficient channel compensation module and achieves a more robust representation capability against channel interference by extracting and integrating multi-domain features, including intra-antenna temporal correlations and inter-antenna channel correlations. We have verified our method on the widely-used dataset, MIMOSig-Ref, with complex mobile channel environments. Extensive experiments confirm the performance advantages of CAMD over previous state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Analytical and Cross-Sectional Clinical Validity of a Smartphone-Based U-Turn Test in Multiple Sclerosis
Authors: Marta Płonka, Rafał Klimas, Dimitar Stanev, Lorenza Angelini, Natan Napiórkowski, Gabriela González Chan, Lisa Bunn, Paul S Glazier, Richard Hosking, Jenny Freeman, Jeremy Hobart, Mattia Zanon, Jonathan Marsden, Licinio Craveiro, Mike D Rinderknecht
Abstract: The observational GaitLab study (ISRCTN15993728) enrolled adult people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) <=6.5. PwMS performed the U-Turn Test (UTT), a smartphone-based assessment of dynamic balance, in a gait laboratory (supervised setting) using 6 smartphones at different body locations and daily during a 2-week remote period (unsupervised setting) using 1 smartphone. In the supervised setting, the accuracy of detecting turns with smartphones was compared against turns detected with a motion capture system (mocap) using F1 scores. Agreement between turn speed measured with smartphones and mocap was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC[3,1]) and bias. In the unsupervised setting, test-retest reliability was assessed by ICC(2,1), and correlations with clinical and patient-reported measures by Spearman rank correlation. Ninety-six PwMS were included. In the supervised setting, turns were detected with high accuracy (F1 scores >95% across smartphone wear locations). Smartphone-derived turn speed was comparable across the supervised (1.44 rad/s) and unsupervised settings (1.47 rad/s), and with mocap-derived turn speed (1.47 rad/s). ICC(3,1) revealed high agreement between smartphone- and mocap-derived turn speed (ICC[3,1]: 0.87-0.92 across smartphone wear locations). Bias was minimal (-0.04 to 0.11 rad/s). In the unsupervised setting, test-retest reliability (ICC[2,1]) was >0.90 when aggregating >=2 tests. The UTT correlated with Timed 25-Foot Walk gait speed, EDSS, Ambulation score, 12-item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale, and Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale (r=-0.79 to -0.61). The UTT measures turn speed accurately and reproducibly irrespective of smartphone wear location and settings. These findings affirm its potential as a valuable tool in multiple sclerosis trials.

Title: Distributed Riemannian Optimization in Geodesically Non-convex Environments
Authors: Xiuheng Wang, Ricardo Borsoi, Cédric Richard, Ali H. Sayed
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of distributed Riemannian optimization over a network of agents whose cost functions are geodesically smooth but possibly geodesically non-convex. Extending a well-known distributed optimization strategy called diffusion adaptation to Riemannian manifolds, we show that the resulting algorithm, the Riemannian diffusion adaptation, provably exhibits several desirable behaviors when minimizing a sum of geodesically smooth non-convex functions over manifolds of bounded curvature. More specifically, we establish that the algorithm can approximately achieve network agreement in the sense that Fréchet variance of the iterates among the agents is small. Moreover, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a first-order stationary point for general geodesically non-convex cost functions. When the global cost function additionally satisfies the Riemannian Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition, we also show that it converges linearly under a constant step size up to a steady-state error. Finally, we apply this algorithm to a decentralized robust principal component analysis (PCA) problem formulated on the Grassmann manifold and illustrate its convergence and performance through numerical simulations.

Title: Markov-Renewal Single-Photon LiDAR Simulator
Authors: Weijian Zhang, Prateek Chennuri, Hashan K. Weerasooriya, Bole Ma, Stanley H. Chan
Abstract: Single-photon LiDAR (SP-LiDAR) simulators face a dilemma: fast but inaccurate Poisson models or accurate but prohibitively slow sequential models. This paper breaks that compromise. We present a simulator that achieves both fidelity and speed by focusing on the critical, yet overlooked, component of simulation: the photon count statistics. Our key contribution is a Markov-renewal process (MRP) formulation that, for the first time, analytically predicts the mean and variance of registered photon counts under dead time. To make this MRP model computationally tractable, we introduce a spectral truncation rule that efficiently computes the complex covariance statistics. By proving the shift-invariance of the process, we extend this per-pixel model to full histogram cube generation via a precomputed lookup table. Our method generates 3D cubes indistinguishable from the sequential gold-standard, yet is orders of magnitude faster. This finally enables large-scale, physically-faithful data generation for learning-based SP-LiDAR reconstruction.

Title: TripleC Learning and Lightweight Speech Enhancement for Multi-Condition Target Speech Extraction
Authors: Ziling Huang (Shanghai Normal University, China)
Abstract: In our recent work, we proposed Lightweight Speech Enhancement Guided Target Speech Extraction (LGTSE) and demonstrated its effectiveness in multi-speaker-plus-noise scenarios. However, real-world applications often involve more diverse and complex conditions, such as one-speaker-plus-noise or two-speaker-without-noise. To address this challenge, we extend LGTSE with a Cross-Condition Consistency learning strategy, termed TripleC Learning. This strategy is first validated under multi-speaker-plus-noise condition and then evaluated for its generalization across diverse scenarios. Moreover, building upon the lightweight front-end denoiser in LGTSE, which can flexibly process both noisy and clean mixtures and shows strong generalization to unseen conditions, we integrate TripleC learning with a proposed parallel universal training scheme that organizes batches containing multiple scenarios for the same target speaker. By enforcing consistent extraction across different conditions, easier cases can assist harder ones, thereby fully exploiting diverse training data and fostering a robust universal model. Experimental results on the Libri2Mix three-condition tasks demonstrate that the proposed LGTSE with TripleC learning achieves superior performance over condition-specific models, highlighting its strong potential for universal deployment in real-world speech applications.

Title: HiPPO: Exploring A Novel Hierarchical Pronunciation Assessment Approach for Spoken Languages
Authors: Bi-Cheng Yan, Hsin-Wei Wang, Fu-An Chao, Tien-Hong Lo, Yung-Chang Hsu, Berlin Chen
Abstract: Automatic pronunciation assessment (APA) seeks to quantify a second language (L2) learner's pronunciation proficiency in a target language by offering timely and fine-grained diagnostic feedback. Most existing efforts on APA have predominantly concentrated on highly constrained reading-aloud tasks (where learners are prompted to read a reference text aloud); however, assessing pronunciation quality in unscripted speech (or free-speaking scenarios) remains relatively underexplored. In light of this, we first propose HiPPO, a hierarchical pronunciation assessment model tailored for spoken languages, which evaluates an L2 learner's oral proficiency at multiple linguistic levels based solely on the speech uttered by the learner. To improve the overall accuracy of assessment, a contrastive ordinal regularizer and a curriculum learning strategy are introduced for model training. The former aims to generate score-discriminative features by exploiting the ordinal nature of regression targets, while the latter gradually ramps up the training complexity to facilitate the assessment task that takes unscripted speech as input. Experiments conducted on the Speechocean762 benchmark dataset validates the feasibility and superiority of our method in relation to several cutting-edge baselines.

Title: Generalized Pinching-Antenna Systems: A Leaky-Coaxial-Cable Perspective
Authors: Kaidi Wang, Zhiguo Ding, Lajos Hanzo
Abstract: The evolution toward the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks has flexible reconfigurable antenna architectures capable of adapting their radiation characteristics to the surrounding environment. At the center-stage, while waveguide based pinching antennas have been shown to beneficially ameliorate wireless propagation environments, their applications have remained confined to high-frequency scenarios. As a remedy, we propose a downlink generalized pinching-antenna system that adapts this compelling concept to low-frequency operation through a leaky-coaxial-cable (LCX) implementation. By endowing LCX structures with controllable radiation slots, the system inherits the key capabilities of waveguide based pinching antennas. Explicitly, these include reconfigurable line-of-sight (LoS) links, reduced path loss, and flexible deployment, while supporting a practical implementation of the pinching-antenna concept at low frequencies. A twin-stage propagation model is developed for characterizing both the guided transmission and wireless radiation encountered over LoS and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths. Analytical results reveal strong local gain, complemented by rapid distance-dependent decay. Hence, we conceive a matching joint optimization framework, which maximizes throughput by harnessing game-theoretic association and convex power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate substantial performance gains over conventional fixed-antenna benchmarks.

Title: Efficient Decoders for Sensing Subspace Code
Authors: Siva Aditya Gooty, Hessam Mahdavifar
Abstract: Sparse antenna array sensing of source/target via direction of arrival (DoA) estimation motivates design of the sensing framework in joint communication and sensing (JCAS) systems for sixth generation (6G) communication systems. Recently, it is established by Mahdavifar, Rajamäki, and Pal that array geometry of sparse arrays has fundamental connections with the design of subspace codes in coding theory. This was then utilized to design efficient \textit{sensing subspace codes} that estimate the DoA with good resolution. Specifically, the Bose-Chowla sensing subspace code provides near optimal code design for unique DoA estimation with tight theoretical upper bound on the error performance. However, the currently known decoder for these codes, to estimate the DoA, is a traditional \textit{Maximum-a-Posterior (MAP) decoder} with complexity that is cubic with the number of antennas. In this work, we propose novel efficient decoding algorithms for sensing subspace codes, that reduce the complexity down to quadratic while providing new knobs to tune in order to tradeoff complexity with error performance. The decoders are further evaluated for their performance via Monte Carlo simulations for a range of SNRs demonstrating promising performance that smoothly approaches the MAP performance as the complexity grows from quadratic to cubic in the number of antennas.

Title: A Randomized Scheduling Framework for Privacy-Preserving Multi-robot Rendezvous given Prior Information
Authors: Le Liu, Yu Kawano, Ming Cao
Abstract: Privacy has become a critical concern in modern multi-robot systems, driven by both ethical considerations and operational constraints. As a result, growing attention has been directed toward privacy-preserving coordination in dynamical multi-robot systems. This work introduces a randomized scheduling mechanism for privacy-preserving robot rendezvous. The proposed approach achieves improved privacy even at lower communication rates, where privacy is quantified via pointwise maximal leakage. We show that lower transmission rates provide stronger privacy guarantees and prove that rendezvous is still achieved under the randomized scheduling mechanism. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.

Authors: David Wang, Wilson Chen, Tianju Wang, Jiale Zhang
Abstract: Interactive surfaces have evolved from capacitive touch and IR based systems into a diverse ecosystem of sensing technologies that support rich and expressive human computer interaction. This survey traces that progression, beginning with infrared vision based approaches, such as FTIR and diffuse illumination, and the rise of capacitive touch as the dominant technology in modern devices, to focusing on contemporary modalities including vision and acoustic sensing. New technologies under development are also discussed, including mmWave radar, and vibration based techniques. Each sensing technique is examined in terms of its operating principles, resolution, scalability, and applications, along with discussions of multimodal integration. By comparing tradeoffs between sensing modalities, the survey highlights the technical and design factors that shape interactive surface performance and user experience. The review concludes by identifying persistent challenges, including sensing accuracy, power constraints, and privacy concerns, and outlines how emerging sensing modalities can enable future interactive environments to be ubiquitous and intelligent.

Title: Probabilistic Safety under Arbitrary Disturbance Distributions using Piecewise-Affine Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Matisse Teuwen, Mathijs Schuurmans, Panagiotis Patrinos
Abstract: We propose a simple safety filter design for stochastic discrete-time systems based on piecewise affine probabilistic control barrier functions, providing an appealing balance between modeling flexibility and computational complexity. Exact evaluation of the safety filter consists of solving a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP) if the dynamics are control-affine (or a mixed-integer nonlinear program in general). We propose a heuristic search method that replaces this by a small number of small-scale quadratic programs (QPs), or nonlinear programs (NLPs) respectively. The proposed approach provides a flexible framework in which arbitrary (data-driven) quantile estimators can be used to bound the probability of safety violations. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate improvements in conservatism and computation time with respect to existing methods, and we illustrate the flexibility of the method for modeling complex safety sets. Supplementary material can be found at this https URL.

Title: Sliding Mode Control and Subspace Stabilization Methodology for the Orbital Stabilization of Periodic Trajectories
Authors: Maksim Surov, Leonid Freidovich
Abstract: This paper presents a combined sliding-mode control and subspace stabilization methodology for orbital stabilization of periodic trajectories in underactuated mechanical systems with one degree of underactuation. The approach starts with partial feedback linearization and stabilization. Then, transverse linearization along the reference orbit is computed, resulting in a periodic linear time-varying system with a stable subspace. Sliding-mode control drives trajectories toward this subspace. The proposed design avoids solving computationally intensive periodic LQR problems and improves robustness to matched disturbances. The methodology is validated through experiments on the Butterfly robot.

Title: Experimental Sensitivity Enhancement of a Quantum Rydberg Atom-Based RF Receiver with a Metamaterial GRIN Lens
Authors: Anton Tishchenko, Demos Serghiou, Ashwin Thelappilly Joy, Paul Marsh, Paul Martin, Tim Brown, Gabriele Gradoni, Mohsen Khalily, Rahim Tafazolli
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate enhanced sensitivity of an atom-based Rydberg radio frequency (RF) receiver integrated with a gradient refractive index (GRIN) Luneburg-type metamaterial lens. By analyzing the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) effect in Cesium vapor, we compare receiver performance with and without the GRIN lens under a 2.2~GHz and a 3.6~GHz far-field excitation. Our measurements reveal a significant amplification of the EIT transparency window when the lens is introduced, consistent with the theoretical prediction that the local E-field enhancement at the vapor cell reduces the minimum detectable electric field and increases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the Rydberg RF receiver. This experimental validation highlights the potential of metamaterial-assisted quantum sensing to overcome the inherent bandwidth and sensitivity limitations of bare Rydberg receivers for a variety of applications, such as electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing, quantum radar, and wireless communications.

Title: Universal Quantum Interconnects via Phase-Coherent Four-Wave Mixing
Authors: Hao Zhang, Yang Xu, Linshan Sun, Wei Cui, Robert W. Boyd, Sergio Carbajo
Abstract: Quantum transduction, which enables the coherent conversion of quantum information between disparate physical platforms, is a cornerstone for realizing scalable and interoperable quantum networks. Among various approaches, parametric frequency mixing processes such as four-wave mixing (FWM) offer a promising pathway toward efficient and low-noise transduction. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of coherent quantum state transfer by indirectly verifying high-fidelity wavefunction's phase mapping (>99%) from the input field to the generated output field wave. Using a gas-filled hollow-core capillary fiber, we systematically investigate spectral phase evolution across a broad range, including infrared (IR) to ultraviolet (UV) transitions, as well as conversions from telecom-band (1550 nm) to visible (516 nm) and deep-UV (308 nm) wavelengths. Our results reveal that strong phase coherence can be maintained throughout these diverse conversion regimes. Because quantum properties such as coherence and entanglement are intrinsically encoded in both the amplitude and phase of a photonic wavefunction, preserving spectral phase is essential for faithful quantum information transfer. We further show that efficient and phase-preserving transduction can be achieved by tuning system parameters, offering valuable insights into nonlinear coupling dynamics. These findings establish a promising foundation for advancing FWM-based quantum transduction schemes and open new avenues for integrating heterogeneous quantum systems across wide spectral domains within future quantum communication networks.

Title: Distributed Articulation Point Identification in Time-Varying Undirected Networks
Authors: Xinye Xie, Ronghao Zheng, Senlin Zhang, Meiqin Liu
Abstract: Identifying articulation points (APs) is fundamental to assessing the robustness of time-varying networks. In such dynamic environments, topological changes including edge additions and deletions can instantly alter the set of APs, demanding rapid and efficient re-assessment. This paper proposes a fully distributed algorithm for identifying APs and monitoring biconnectivity. Our core contribution is an incremental update protocol. Unlike static methods that require global re-initialization which incurs high communication overhead, our algorithm propagates information from the site of the change, updating only the affected nodes' state values. This approach, which builds upon a maximum consensus protocol, not only ensures convergence to the correct AP set following topological changes but also preserves network privacy by preventing nodes from reconstructing the global topology. We provide rigorous proofs of correctness for this eventual convergence and demonstrate its applicability and efficiency through experiments.

Title: Vision-Language-Action Models for Selective Robotic Disassembly: A Case Study on Critical Component Extraction from Desktops
Authors: Chang Liu, Sibo Tian, Sara Behdad, Xiao Liang, Minghui Zheng
Abstract: Automating disassembly of critical components from end-of-life (EoL) desktops, such as high-value items like RAM modules and CPUs, as well as sensitive parts like hard disk drives, remains challenging due to the inherent variability and uncertainty of these products. Moreover, their disassembly requires sequential, precise, and dexterous operations, further increasing the complexity of automation. Current robotic disassembly processes are typically divided into several stages: perception, sequence planning, task planning, motion planning, and manipulation. Each stage requires explicit modeling, which limits generalization to unfamiliar scenarios. Recent development of vision-language-action (VLA) models has presented an end-to-end approach for general robotic manipulation tasks. Although VLAs have demonstrated promising performance on simple tasks, the feasibility of applying such models to complex disassembly remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we collected a customized dataset for robotic RAM and CPU disassembly and used it to fine-tune two well-established VLA approaches, OpenVLA and OpenVLA-OFT, as a case study. We divided the whole disassembly task into several small steps, and our preliminary experimental results indicate that the fine-tuned VLA models can faithfully complete multiple early steps but struggle with certain critical subtasks, leading to task failure. However, we observed that a simple hybrid strategy that combines VLA with a rule-based controller can successfully perform the entire disassembly operation. These findings highlight the current limitations of VLA models in handling the dexterity and precision required for robotic EoL product disassembly. By offering a detailed analysis of the observed results, this study provides insights that may inform future research to address current challenges and advance end-to-end robotic automated disassembly.

Title: Joint Low-Rank and Sparse Bayesian Channel Estimation for Ultra-Massive MIMO Communications
Authors: Jianghan Ji, Cheng-Xiang Wang, Shuaifei Chen, Chen Huang, Xiping Wu, Emil Björnson
Abstract: This letter investigates channel estimation for ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications. We propose a joint low-rank and sparse Bayesian estimation (LRSBE) algorithm for spatial non-stationary ultra-massive channels by exploiting the low-rankness and sparsity in the beam domain. Specifically, the channel estimation integrates sparse Bayesian learning and soft-threshold gradient descent within the expectation-maximization framework. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives under different signal-to-noise ratio conditions in terms of estimation accuracy and overall complexity.

Title: AI-Assisted Game Management Decisions: A Fuzzy Logic Approach to Real-Time Substituitions
Authors: Pedro Passos
Abstract: In elite soccer, substitution decisions entail significant financial and sporting consequences yet remain heavily reliant on intuition or predictive models that merely mimic historical biases. This paper introduces a Fuzzy Logic based Decision Support System (DSS) designed for real time, prescriptive game management. Unlike traditional Machine Learning approaches that encounter a predictive ceiling by attempting to replicate human behavior, our system audits performance through an objective, rule based inference engine. We propose a methodological advancement by reformulating the PlayeRank metric into a Cumulative Mean with Role Aware Normalization, eliminating the play time exposure bias inherent in cumulative sum models to enable accurate intra match comparison. The system integrates this refined metric with physiological proxies (fatigue) and contextual variables (disciplinary risk modulated by tactical role) to calculate a dynamic Substitution Priority (P final). Validation via a case study of the 2018 FIFA World Cup match between Brazil and Belgium demonstrates the system's ecological validity: it not only aligned with expert consensus on executed substitutions (for example Gabriel Jesus) but, crucially, identified high risk scenarios ignored by human decision makers. Specifically, the model flagged the "FAGNER Paradox" - a maximum priority defensive risk - minutes before a critical yellow card, and detected the "Lukaku Paradox", where an isolated assist masked a severe drop in participation. These results confirm that Fuzzy Logic offers a transparent, explainable, and superior alternative to black box models for optimizing real time tactical decisions.

Title: WiFi-based Cross-Domain Gesture Recognition Using Attention Mechanism
Authors: Ruijing Liu, Cunhua Pan, Jiaming Zeng, Hong Ren, Kezhi Wang, Lei Kong, Jiangzhou Wang
Abstract: While fulfilling communication tasks, wireless signals can also be used to sense the environment. Among various types of sensing media, WiFi signals offer advantages such as widespread availability, low hardware cost, and strong robustness to environmental conditions like light, temperature, and humidity. By analyzing Wi-Fi signals in the environment, it is possible to capture dynamic changes of the human body and accomplish sensing applications such as gesture recognition. Although many existing gesture sensing solutions perform well in-domain but lack cross-domain capabilities (i.e., recognition performance in untrained environments). To address this, we extract Doppler spectra from the channel state information (CSI) received by all receivers and concatenate each Doppler spectrum along the same time axis to generate fused images with multi-angle information as input features. Furthermore, inspired by the convolutional block attention module (CBAM), we propose a gesture recognition network that integrates a multi-semantic spatial attention mechanism with a self-attention-based channel mechanism. This network constructs attention maps to quantify the spatiotemporal features of gestures in images, enabling the extraction of key domain-independent features. Additionally, ResNet18 is employed as the backbone network to further capture deep-level features. To validate the network performance, we evaluate the proposed network on the public Widar3 dataset, and the results show that it not only maintains high in-domain accuracy of 99.72%, but also achieves high performance in cross-domain recognition of 97.61%, significantly outperforming existing best solutions.

Title: An accelerated proximal bundle method for convex optimization
Authors: Feng-Yi Liao, Thomas Madden, Yang Zheng
Abstract: The proximal bundle method (PBM) is a powerful and widely used approach for minimizing nonsmooth convex functions. However, for smooth objectives, its best-known convergence rate remains suboptimal, and whether PBM can be accelerated remains open. In this work, we present the first accelerated proximal bundle method that achieves the optimal $\mathscr{O}(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ iteration complexity for obtaining an $\epsilon$-accurate solution in smooth convex optimization. The proposed method is conceptually simple, which differs from Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent by only a single line and retains all key structural properties of the classical PBM. In particular, it relies on the same minimal assumptions on model approximations and preserves the standard bundle testing criterion. Numerical experiments confirm the accelerated $\mathscr{O}(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ convergence rate predicted by our theory.

Title: Multi-Loss Learning for Speech Emotion Recognition with Energy-Adaptive Mixup and Frame-Level Attention
Authors: Cong Wang, Yizhong Geng, Yuhua Wen, Qifei Li, Yingming Gao, Ruimin Wang, Chunfeng Wang, Hao Li, Ya Li, Wei Chen
Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) is an important technology in human-computer interaction. However, achieving high performance is challenging due to emotional complexity and scarce annotated data. To tackle these challenges, we propose a multi-loss learning (MLL) framework integrating an energy-adaptive mixup (EAM) method and a frame-level attention module (FLAM). The EAM method leverages SNR-based augmentation to generate diverse speech samples capturing subtle emotional variations. FLAM enhances frame-level feature extraction for multi-frame emotional cues. Our MLL strategy combines Kullback-Leibler divergence, focal, center, and supervised contrastive loss to optimize learning, address class imbalance, and improve feature separability. We evaluate our method on four widely used SER datasets: IEMOCAP, MSP-IMPROV, RAVDESS, and SAVEE. The results demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, suggesting its effectiveness and robustness.

Title: RRPO: Robust Reward Policy Optimization for LLM-based Emotional TTS
Authors: Cong Wang, Changfeng Gao, Yang Xiang, Zhihao Du, Keyu An, Han Zhao, Qian Chen, Xiangang Li, Yingming Gao, Ya Li
Abstract: Differentiable reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks like DiffRO offer a powerful approach for controllable text-to-speech (TTS), but are vulnerable to reward hacking, particularly for nuanced tasks like emotion control. The policy model can exploit a vanilla Reward Model (RM) by generating acoustic artifacts to achieve spurious rewards, but at the cost of degrading perceptual quality. To address this, we propose Robust Reward Policy Optimization (RRPO), a novel framework that employs a hybrid regularization scheme. This scheme develops a robust RM whose reward signal is more reliably aligned with human perception, compelling the policy to abandon detrimental shortcuts and instead learn the complex features of genuine emotions. Our ablation study confirms the enhanced robustness of our RM, as evidenced by its strong cross-lingual generalization. The subjective evaluation demonstrates that this robust RM effectively mitigates reward hacking, leading to significant improvements in both emotional expressiveness and naturalness over all baselines.

Title: Omniscient Attacker in Stochastic Security Games with Interdependent Nodes
Authors: Yuksel Arslantas, Ahmed Said Donmez, Ege Yuceel, Muhammed O. Sayin
Abstract: The adoption of reinforcement learning for critical infrastructure defense introduces a vulnerability where sophisticated attackers can strategically exploit the defense algorithm's learning dynamics. While prior work addresses this vulnerability in the context of repeated normal-form games, its extension to the stochastic games remains an open research gap. We close this gap by examining stochastic security games between an RL defender and an omniscient attacker, utilizing a tractable linear influence network model. To overcome the structural limitations of prior methods, we propose and apply neuro-dynamic programming. Our experimental results demonstrate that the omniscient attacker can significantly outperform a naive defender, highlighting the critical vulnerability introduced by the learning dynamics and the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

Title: Timely Information for Strategic Persuasion
Authors: Ahmet Bugra Gundogan, Melih Bastopcu
Abstract: This work investigates a dynamic variant of Bayesian persuasion, in which a strategic sender seeks to influence a receiver's belief over time through controlling the timing of the information disclosure, under resource constraints. We consider a binary information source (i.e., taking values 0 or 1), where the source's state evolve according to a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). In this setting, the receiver aims to estimate the source's state as accurately as possible. In contrast, the sender seeks to persuade the receiver to estimate the state to be 1, regardless of whether this estimate reflects the true state. This misalignment between their objectives naturally leads to a Stackelberg game formulation where the sender, acting as the leader, chooses an information-revelation policy, and the receiver, as the follower, decides whether to follow the sender's messages. As a result, the sender's objective is to maximize the long-term average time that the receiver's estimate equals 1, subject to a total sampling constraint and a constraint for the receiver to follow the sender's messages called incentive compatibility (IC) constraint. We first consider the single-source problem and show that the sender's optimal policy is to allocate a minimal sampling rate to the undesired state 0 (just enough to satisfy the IC constraint) and assign the remaining sampling rate to the desired state 1. Next, we extend the analysis to the multi-source case, where each source has a different minimal sampling rate. Our results show that the sender can leverage the timeliness of the revealed information to influence the receiver, thereby achieving a higher utility.

Title: Neural Policy Composition from Free Energy Minimization
Authors: Francesca Rossi, Veronica Centorrino, Francesco Bullo, Giovanni Russo
Abstract: The ability to compose acquired skills to plan and execute behaviors is a hallmark of natural intelligence. Yet, despite remarkable cross-disciplinary efforts, a principled account of how task structure shapes gating and how such computations could be delivered in neural circuits, remains elusive. Here we introduce GateMod, an interpretable theoretically grounded computational model linking the emergence of gating to the underlying decision-making task, and to a neural circuit architecture. We first develop GateFrame, a normative framework casting policy gating into the minimization of the free energy. This framework, relating gating rules to task, applies broadly across neuroscience, cognitive and computational sciences. We then derive GateFlow, a continuous-time energy based dynamics that provably converges to GateFrame optimal solution. Convergence, exponential and global, follows from a contractivity property that also yields robustness and other desirable properties. Finally, we derive a neural circuit from GateFlow, GateNet. This is a soft-competitive recurrent circuit whose components perform local and contextual computations consistent with known dendritic and neural processing motifs. We evaluate GateMod across two different settings: collective behaviors in multi-agent systems and human decision-making in multi-armed bandits. In all settings, GateMod provides interpretable mechanistic explanations of gating and quantitatively matches or outperforms established models. GateMod offers a unifying framework for neural policy gating, linking task objectives, dynamical computation, and circuit-level mechanisms. It provides a framework to understand gating in natural agents beyond current explanations and to equip machines with this ability.

Title: Embodied Co-Design for Rapidly Evolving Agents: Taxonomy, Frontiers, and Challenges
Authors: Yuxing Wang, Zhiyu Chen, Tiantian Zhang, Qiyue Yin, Yongzhe Chang, Zhiheng Li, Liang Wang, Xueqian Wang
Abstract: Brain-body co-evolution enables animals to develop complex behaviors in their environments. Inspired by this biological synergy, embodied co-design (ECD) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for creating intelligent agents-from virtual creatures to physical robots-by jointly optimizing their morphologies and controllers rather than treating control in isolation. This integrated approach facilitates richer environmental interactions and robust task performance. In this survey, we provide a systematic overview of recent advances in ECD. We first formalize the concept of ECD and position it within related fields. We then introduce a hierarchical taxonomy: a lower layer that breaks down agent design into three fundamental components-controlling brain, body morphology, and task environment-and an upper layer that integrates these components into four major ECD frameworks: bi-level, single-level, generative, and open-ended. This taxonomy allows us to synthesize insights from more than one hundred recent studies. We further review notable benchmarks, datasets, and applications in both simulated and real-world scenarios. Finally, we identify significant challenges and offer insights into promising future research directions. A project associated with this survey has been created at this https URL.

Title: TEMPO-VINE: A Multi-Temporal Sensor Fusion Dataset for Localization and Mapping in Vineyards
Authors: Mauro Martini, Marco Ambrosio, Judith Vilella-Cantos, Alessandro Navone, Marcello Chiaberge
Abstract: In recent years, precision agriculture has been introducing groundbreaking innovations in the field, with a strong focus on automation. However, research studies in robotics and autonomous navigation often rely on controlled simulations or isolated field trials. The absence of a realistic common benchmark represents a significant limitation for the diffusion of robust autonomous systems under real complex agricultural conditions. Vineyards pose significant challenges due to their dynamic nature, and they are increasingly drawing attention from both academic and industrial stakeholders interested in automation. In this context, we introduce the TEMPO-VINE dataset, a large-scale multi-temporal dataset specifically designed for evaluating sensor fusion, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and place recognition techniques within operational vineyard environments. TEMPO-VINE is the first multi-modal public dataset that brings together data from heterogeneous LiDARs of different price levels, AHRS, RTK-GPS, and cameras in real trellis and pergola vineyards, with multiple rows exceeding 100 m in length. In this work, we address a critical gap in the landscape of agricultural datasets by providing researchers with a comprehensive data collection and ground truth trajectories in different seasons, vegetation growth stages, terrain and weather conditions. The sequence paths with multiple runs and revisits will foster the development of sensor fusion, localization, mapping and place recognition solutions for agricultural fields. The dataset, the processing tools and the benchmarking results will be available at the dedicated webpage upon acceptance.

Title: Adaptive Online Optimization for Microgrids with Renewable Energy Sources
Authors: Wouter J.A. van Weerelt, Angela Fontan, Nicola Bastianello
Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel adaptive online optimization algorithm tailored to the management of microgrids with high renewable energy penetration, which can be formulated as a constrained, online optimization problem. The proposed algorithm is characterized by a control-based design that applies the internal model principle, and a system identification routine tasked with identifying such internal model. In addition, in order to ensure the constraints are verified, we integrate a projection onto the constraint set. We showcase promising numerical results for the microgrid use case, highlighting in particular the enhanced adaptability of the proposed algorithm to changes in the internal model. The performance of the proposed algorithm is shown to outperform state-of-the-art alternative in the long-term, ensuring efficient management of the grid.

Title: Exact 3-D Channel Impulse Response for Spherical Receivers with Arbitrary Drift Directions
Authors: Yen-Chi Lee, Ping-Cheng Yeh, Chia-Han Lee
Abstract: Accurate channel modeling for spherical absorbing receivers is fundamental to the design of realistic molecular multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. While advanced modulation schemes have been proposed to mitigate interference, determining the channel impulse response (CIR) under arbitrary flow directions remains a challenge; existing exact solutions are restricted to either 1-D/no-drift scenarios or planar receiver geometries. Addressing this gap, we derive the first exact analytical CIR for a spherical receiver in a 3-D molecular communication system with uniform drift in an arbitrary direction. Unlike prior approximations that ignore the angle between the drift and the transmission axis, our approach utilizes the Girsanov theorem to analytically transform the hitting-time distribution from a stationary medium to a drifted one. The proposed closed-form expression not only eliminates modeling errors inherent in previous approximations for off-axis receivers but also enables efficient parameter-space exploration of critical system metrics (e.g., peak time and amplitude), a task that would be computationally costly with pure simulation-based approaches.

Title: Communicating Properties of Quantum States over Classical Noisy Channels
Authors: Nikhitha Nunavath, Jiechen Chen, Osvaldo Simeone, Riccardo Bassoli, Frank H. P. Fitzek
Abstract: Transmitting information about quantum states over classical noisy channels is an important problem with applications to science, computing, and sensing. This task, however, poses fundamental challenges due to the exponential scaling of state space with system size. We introduce shadow tomography-based transmission with unequal error protection (STT-UEP), a novel communication protocol that enables efficient transmission of properties of quantum states, allowing decoder-side estimation of arbitrary observables. Unlike conventional approaches requiring the transmission of a number of bits that is exponential in the number of qubits, STT-UEP achieves communication complexity that scales logarithmically with the number of observables, depending on the observable weight. The protocol exploits classical shadow tomography for measurement efficiency, and applies unequal error protection by encoding measurement bases with stronger channel codes than measurement outcomes. We provide theoretical guarantees on estimation accuracy as a function of the bit error probability of the classical channel, and validate the approach against several benchmarks via numerical results.

Title: On Disturbance-Aware Minimum-Time Trajectory Planning: Evidence from Tests on a Dynamic Driving Simulator
Authors: Matteo Masoni, Vincenzo Palermo, Marco Gabiccini, Martino Gulisano, Giorgio Previati, Massimiliano Gobbi, Francesco Comolli, Gianpiero Mastinu, Massimo Guiggiani
Abstract: This work investigates how disturbance-aware, robustness-embedded reference trajectories translate into driving performance when executed by professional drivers in a dynamic simulator. Three planned reference trajectories are compared against a free-driving baseline (NOREF) to assess trade-offs between lap time (LT) and steering effort (SE): NOM, the nominal time-optimal trajectory; TLC, a track-limit-robust trajectory obtained by tightening margins to the track edges; and FLC, a friction-limit-robust trajectory obtained by tightening against axle and tire saturation. All trajectories share the same minimum lap-time objective with a small steering-smoothness regularizer and are evaluated by two professional drivers using a high-performance car on a virtual track. The trajectories derive from a disturbance-aware minimum-lap-time framework recently proposed by the authors, where worst-case disturbance growth is propagated over a finite horizon and used to tighten tire-friction and track-limit constraints, preserving performance while providing probabilistic safety margins. LT and SE are used as performance indicators, while RMS lateral deviation, speed error, and drift angle characterize driving style. Results show a Pareto-like LT-SE trade-off: NOM yields the shortest LT but highest SE; TLC minimizes SE at the cost of longer LT; FLC lies near the efficient frontier, substantially reducing SE relative to NOM with only a small LT increase. Removing trajectory guidance (NOREF) increases both LT and SE, confirming that reference trajectories improve pace and control efficiency. Overall, the findings highlight reference-based and disturbance-aware planning, especially FLC, as effective tools for training and for achieving fast yet stable trajectories.

Title: Environment-Aware Channel Inference via Cross-Modal Flow: From Multimodal Sensing to Wireless Channels
Authors: Guangming Liang, Mingjie Yang, Dongzhu Liu, Paul Henderson, Lajos Hanzo
Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) underpins reliable and efficient wireless communication. However, acquiring CSI via pilot estimation incurs substantial overhead, especially in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems operating in high-Doppler environments. By leveraging the growing availability of environmental sensing data, this treatise investigates pilot-free channel inference that estimates complete CSI directly from multimodal observations, including camera images, LiDAR point clouds, and GPS coordinates. In contrast to prior studies that rely on predefined channel models, we develop a data-driven framework that formulates the sensing-to-channel mapping as a cross-modal flow matching problem. The framework fuses multimodal features into a latent distribution within the channel domain, and learns a velocity field that continuously transforms the latent distribution toward the channel distribution. To make this formulation tractable and efficient, we reformulate the problem as an equivalent conditional flow matching objective and incorporate a modality alignment loss, while adopting low-latency inference mechanisms to enable real-time CSI estimation. In experiments, we build a procedural data generator based on Sionna and Blender to support realistic modeling of sensing scenes and wireless propagation. System-level evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over pilot- and sensing-based benchmarks in both channel estimation accuracy and spectral efficiency for the downstream beamforming task.

Title: Dual-Path Region-Guided Attention Network for Ground Reaction Force and Moment Regression
Authors: Xuan Li, Samuel Bello
Abstract: Accurate estimation of three-dimensional ground reaction forces and moments (GRFs/GRMs) is crucial for both biomechanics research and clinical rehabilitation evaluation. In this study, we focus on insole-based GRF/GRM estimation and further validate our approach on a public walking dataset. We propose a Dual-Path Region-Guided Attention Network that integrates anatomy-inspired spatial priors and temporal priors into a region-level attention mechanism, while a complementary path captures context from the full sensor field. The two paths are trained jointly and their outputs are combined to produce the final GRF/GRM predictions. Conclusions: Our model outperforms strong baseline models, including CNN and CNN-LSTM architectures on two datasets, achieving the lowest six-component average NRMSE of 5.78% on the insole dataset and 1.42% for the vertical ground reaction force on the public dataset. This demonstrates robust performance for ground reaction force and moment estimation.

Title: Semantic Soft Bootstrapping: Long Context Reasoning in LLMs without Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Purbesh Mitra, Sennur Ulukus
Abstract: Long context reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated enhancement of their cognitive capabilities via chain-of-thought (CoT) inference. Training such models is usually done via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in reasoning based problems, like math and programming. However, RLVR is limited by several bottlenecks, such as, lack of dense reward, and inadequate sample efficiency. As a result, it requires significant compute resources in post-training phase. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we propose \textbf{Semantic Soft Bootstrapping (SSB)}, a self-distillation technique, in which the same base language model plays the role of both teacher and student, but receives different semantic contexts about the correctness of its outcome at training time. The model is first prompted with a math problem and several rollouts are generated. From them, the correct and most common incorrect response are filtered, and then provided to the model in context to produce a more robust, step-by-step explanation with a verified final answer. This pipeline automatically curates a paired teacher-student training set from raw problem-answer data, without any human intervention. This generation process also produces a sequence of logits, which is what the student model tries to match in the training phase just from the bare question alone. In our experiment, Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We then tested its accuracy on MATH500, and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our experiments show a jump of 10.6%, and 10% improvements in accuracy, respectively, over group relative policy optimization (GRPO), which is a commonly used RLVR algorithm. Our code is available at this https URL, and the model, curated dataset is available at this https URL.

Title: Deep infant brain segmentation from multi-contrast MRI
Authors: Malte Hoffmann, Lilla Zöllei, Adrian V. Dalca
Abstract: Segmentation of magnetic resonance images (MRI) facilitates analysis of human brain development by delineating anatomical structures. However, in infants and young children, accurate segmentation is challenging due to development and imaging constraints. Pediatric brain MRI is notoriously difficult to acquire, with inconsistent availability of imaging modalities, substantial non-head anatomy in the field of view, and frequent motion artifacts. This has led to specialized segmentation models that are often limited to specific image types or narrow age groups, or that are fragile for more variable images such as those acquired clinically. We address this method fragmentation with BabySeg, a deep learning brain segmentation framework for infants and young children that supports diverse MRI protocols, including repeat scans and image types unavailable during training. Our approach builds on recent domain randomization techniques, which synthesize training images far beyond realistic bounds to promote dataset shift invariance. We also describe a mechanism that enables models to flexibly pool and interact features from any number of input scans. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance that matches or exceeds the accuracy of several existing methods for various age cohorts and input configurations using a single model, in a fraction of the runtime required by many existing tools.

Title: Using Dynamic Safety Margins as Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Victor Freire, Marco M. Nicotra
Abstract: This paper presents an approach to design control barrier functions (CBFs) for arbitrary state and input constraints using tools from the reference governor literature. In particular, it is shown that dynamic safety margins (DSMs) are CBFs for an augmented system obtained by concatenating the state with a virtual reference. The proposed approach is agnostic to the relative degree and can handle multiple state and input constraints using the control-sharing property of CBFs. The construction of CBFs using Lyapunov-based DSMs is then investigated in further detail. Numerical simulations show that the method outperforms existing DSM-based approaches, while also guaranteeing safety and persistent feasibility of the associated optimization program.

Abstract: Cardiovascular health is vital to human well-being, and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is considered the {clinical reference standard} for diagnosing cardiovascular disease. However, its adoption is hindered by long scan times, complex contrasts, and inconsistent quality. While deep learning methods perform well on specific CMR imaging {sequences}, they often fail to generalize across modalities and sampling schemes. The lack of benchmarks for high-quality, fast CMR image reconstruction further limits technology comparison and adoption. The CMRxRecon2024 challenge, attracting over 200 teams from 18 countries, addressed these issues with two tasks: generalization to unseen {modalities} and robustness to diverse undersampling patterns. We introduced the largest public multi-{modality} CMR raw dataset, an open benchmarking platform, and shared code. Analysis of the best-performing solutions revealed that prompt-based adaptation and enhanced physics-driven consistency enabled strong cross-scenario performance. These findings establish principles for generalizable reconstruction models and advance clinically translatable AI in cardiovascular imaging.

Title: Energy-Aware Lane Planning for Connected Electric Vehicles in Urban Traffic: Design and Vehicle-in-the-Loop Validation
Authors: Hansung Kim, Eric Yongkeun Choi, Eunhyek Joa, Hotae Lee, Linda Lim, Scott Moura, Francesco Borrelli
Abstract: Urban driving with connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) offers potential for energy savings, yet most eco-driving strategies focus solely on longitudinal speed control within a single lane. This neglects the significant impact of lateral decisions, such as lane changes, on overall energy efficiency, especially in environments with traffic signals and heterogeneous traffic flow. To address this gap, we propose a novel energy-aware motion planning framework that jointly optimizes longitudinal speed and lateral lane-change decisions using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. Our approach estimates long-term energy costs using a graph-based approximation and solves short-horizon optimal control problems under traffic constraints. Using a data-driven energy model calibrated to an actual battery electric vehicle, we demonstrate with vehicle-in-the-loop experiments that our method reduces motion energy consumption by up to 24 percent compared to a human driver, highlighting the potential of connectivity-enabled planning for sustainable urban autonomy.

Title: Approximation-free Control for Signal Temporal Logic Specifications using Spatiotemporal Tubes
Authors: Ratnangshu Das, Subhodeep Choudhury, Pushpak Jagtap
Abstract: This paper presents a spatiotemporal tube (STT)-based control framework for satisfying Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications in unknown control-affine systems. We formulate STL constraints as a robust optimization problem (ROP) and recast it as a scenario optimization program (SOP) to construct STTs with formal correctness guarantees. We also propose a closed-form control law that operates independently of the system dynamics, and ensures the system trajectory evolves within the STTs, thereby satisfying the STL specifications. The proposed approach is validated through case studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior computational efficiency, trajectory quality, and applicability to complex STL tasks.

Title: Baseline-improved Economic Model Predictive Control for Optimal Microgrid Dispatch
Authors: Avik Ghosh, Adil Khurram, Jan Kleissl, Sonia Martinez
Abstract: As opposed to stabilizing to a reference trajectory or state, Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) optimizes economic performance over a prediction horizon, making it particularly attractive for economic microgrid (MG) dispatch. However, as load and generation forecasts are only known 24-48 h in advance, economically optimal steady states or periodic trajectories are not available and the EMPC-based works that rely on these signals are inadequate. In addition, demand charges, based on maximum monthly grid import power of the MG, cannot be easily casted as an additive cost, which prevents the application of the principle of optimality if introduced naively. In this work, we propose to close this mismatch between the EMPC prediction horizon and existing monthly timescales by means of an appropriately generated baseline reference trajectory. To do this, we first propose an EMPC formulation for a generic deterministic discrete non-linear time-varying system subject to hard state and input constraints. We then show that, under mild assumptions on the terminal cost and region, the asymptotic average economic cost of the proposed method is no worse than a baseline given by any arbitrary reference trajectory that is only known online. In particular, this results into a practical, finite-time upper bound on the average economic cost difference with the baseline that decreases linearly to zero as time goes to infinity. We then show how the proposed EMPC framework can be used to solve optimal MG dispatch problems, introducing various costs and constraints that conform to the required assumptions. By means of this framework, we conduct realistic simulations with data from the Port of San Diego MG, which demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce monthly electricity costs in closed-loop with respect to established baseline reference trajectories.

Title: Spatially tailored spin wave excitation for spurious-free, low-loss magnetostatic wave filters with ultra-wide frequency tunability
Authors: Shuxian Wu, Shun Yao, Xingyu Du, Chin-Yu Chang, Roy H. Olsson III
Abstract: Yttrium iron garnet magnetostatic wave (MSW) radio frequency (RF) cavity filters are promising for sixth-generation (6G) communication systems due to their wide frequency tunability. However, the presence of severe spurious modes arising from the finite cavity dimensions severely degrades the filter performance. We present a half-cone transducer that spatially tailors spin wave excitation to selectively enhance the primary cavity modes comprising the MSW filter passband, while strongly suppressing the undesired spurious modes. Theoretical analysis, numerical simulations and experiments verify the effectiveness of the spatially tailored technique. We utilize the half-cone transducer to demonstrate a spurious-free, single-cavity half-cone MSW filter (HC-MSWF) with an insertion loss (IL) of 2.4-3.2 dB over a frequency tuning range of 6.3-16.8 GHz. Extending our study, we further demonstrate a spurious-free, dual-cavity HC-MSWF with an unprecedented tuning range of 21.7 GHz (9.8-31.5 GHz) while maintaining a low IL of 2.9-3.8 dB. This significant advance in performance will enable highly reconfigurable and robust 6G networks.

Abstract: As neurostimulation devices increasingly incorporate closed-loop functionality, the greater design complexity brings additional requirements for risk management and special considerations to optimise benefit. This manuscript creates a common framework upon which all current and planned neuromodulation-based physiological closed-loop controllers (PCLCs) can be mapped including integration of the Technical Considerations of Medical Devices with Physiologic Closed-Loop Control Technology guidance published in 2023 by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a classification of feedback (reactive) and feedforward (predictive) biomarkers, and control systems theory. We explain risk management in the context of this framework and illustrate its applications for three exemplary technologies. This manuscript serves as guidance to the emerging field of PCLCs in neuromodulation, mitigating risk through standardized nomenclature and a systematic outline for rigorous device development, testing, and implementation.

Title: Flight-Ready Precise and Robust Carrier-Phase GNSS Navigation Software for Distributed Space Systems
Authors: Samuel Y. W. Low, Toby Bell, Simone D'Amico
Abstract: This paper presents the full requirements analysis, design, development, and testing of high-precision navigation flight software for Distributed Space Systems (DSS) using Carrier Phase Differential GNSS (CDGNSS). Five main contributions are made. First, a survey of flown and upcoming DSS missions with stringent precision requirements is conducted, from which a thorough requirements analysis is distilled to guide development and testing. Second, a real-time navigation functional architecture is designed, and adopts a sparse and regularized Consider Kalman Filter with options for numerical stability in-flight. The filter rigorously accounts for uncertainties in process noise, measurement noise, and biases. It tracks float ambiguities with integer resolution where possible. The covariance correlation structure is preserved under all navigation modes, including contingencies and outages. Third, a lightweight, memoryless Fault Detection, Isolation, and Recovery (FDIR) module is developed to guard against anomalous measurements, providing statistical screening and ensuring robust navigation. Fourth, the software architecture is proposed for ease of integration, with strategies presented for modularity and computational efficiency tailored to constrained flight systems. Fifth, a comprehensive test campaign is conducted, mapped to a requirements verification matrix, spanning unit, interface, software-in-the-loop, and real-time hardware-in-the-loop tests, emphasizing gradual test fidelity for efficient fault isolation. Finally, flight-like results are demonstrated using the VISORS mission, due to the generalizability of the VISORS navigation operations, and the stringency which demands sub-centimeter relative position and sub-millimeter-per-second velocity accuracy. This architecture aims to serve as a reference for next-generation DSS missions adopting CDGNSS.

Title: TraceTrans: Translation and Spatial Tracing for Surgical Prediction
Authors: Xiyu Luo, Haodong Li, Xinxing Cheng, He Zhao, Yang Hu, Xuan Song, Tianyang Zhang
Abstract: Image-to-image translation models have achieved notable success in converting images across visual domains and are increasingly used for medical tasks such as predicting post-operative outcomes and modeling disease progression. However, most existing methods primarily aim to match the target distribution and often neglect spatial correspondences between the source and translated images. This limitation can lead to structural inconsistencies and hallucinations, undermining the reliability and interpretability of the predictions. These challenges are accentuated in clinical applications by the stringent requirement for anatomical accuracy. In this work, we present TraceTrans, a novel deformable image translation model designed for post-operative prediction that generates images aligned with the target distribution while explicitly revealing spatial correspondences with the pre-operative input. The framework employs an encoder for feature extraction and dual decoders for predicting spatial deformations and synthesizing the translated image. The predicted deformation field imposes spatial constraints on the generated output, ensuring anatomical consistency with the source. Extensive experiments on medical cosmetology and brain MRI datasets demonstrate that TraceTrans delivers accurate and interpretable post-operative predictions, highlighting its potential for reliable clinical deployment.

Title: An Indoor Radio Mapping Dataset Combining 3D Point Clouds and RSSI
Authors: Ljupcho Milosheski, Kuon Akiyama, Blaž Bertalanič, Jernej Hribar, Ryoichi Shinkuma
Abstract: The growing number of smart devices supporting bandwidth-intensive and latency-sensitive applications, such as real-time video analytics, smart sensing, Extended Reality (XR), etc., necessitates reliable wireless connectivity in indoor environments. In such environments, accurate design of Radio Environment Maps (REMs) enables adaptive wireless network planning and optimization of Access Point (AP) placement. However, generating realistic REMs remains difficult due to the variability of indoor environments and the limitations of existing modeling approaches, which often rely on simplified layouts or fully synthetic data. These challenges are further amplified by the adoption of next-generation Wi-Fi standards, which operate at higher frequencies and suffer from limited range and wall penetration. To support the efforts in addressing these challenges, we collected a dataset that combines high-resolution 3D LiDAR scans with Wi-Fi RSSI measurements collected across 20 setups in a multi-room indoor environment. The dataset includes two measurement scenarios, the first without human presence in the environment, and the second with human presence, enabling the development and validation of REM estimation models that incorporate physical geometry and environmental dynamics. The described dataset supports research in data-driven wireless modeling and the development of high-capacity indoor communication networks.

Title: Analytical Phasor-Based Fault Location Enhancement for Wind Farm Collector Networks
Authors: Alailton J. Alves Junior, Daniel Barbosa, Ricardo A. S. Fernandes, Denis V. Coury
Abstract: The increasing integration of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) is reshaping fault current characteristics, presenting significant challenges to traditional protection and fault location methods. This paper addresses a key limitation in fault location within wind farm collector networks, i.e., one-terminal phasor-based methods become inaccurate when IBRs are electrically located downstream from the fault. In such cases, the voltage drop caused by IBR fault current injections is not captured by the Intelligent Electronic Device, resulting in a systematic overestimation of fault distance. To mitigate this issue, a general compensation framework was proposed by augmenting classical loop formulations with a distance-dependent voltage correction term. The methodology was derived analytically using a sequence-domain representation and generalized to multiple fault types through a unified notation. It maintains the simplicity and interpretability of conventional approaches and can be implemented using only local measurements. The method was evaluated through EMT simulations in PSCAD using a realistic wind farm model. Results show significant improvements in location accuracy, with average and maximum errors notably reduced, especially for ground-involved faults where reductions exceed 90\%. Furthermore, the compensation eliminates sensitivity to wind penetration levels and ensures uniform performance across feeders, positioning the method as a practical solution for modern renewable-dominated grids.

Title: Joint Scheduling of Workload Demand and Energy Supply in Low-carbon Data Centers with Decision-Dependent Uncertainty Set
Authors: Maoyuan Ma, Wangyi Guo, Lei Yang, Zhanbo Xu, Xiaohong Guan
Abstract: This paper addresses the joint scheduling problem of stochastic workloads and a hydrogen-enabled distributed energy system in a low-carbon Internet data centers (IDC). Although such workloads can be shifted over temporal and spatial horizons, it poses challenges when they cannot be accurately predicted, resulting in significant efficiency degradation and high operational cost of the energy system. The problem becomes even more difficult when the workload shifting decisions would influence their randomness, which is natural for the IDC workloads. To tackle these issues, we propose a workload classification model based on the decision-dependent uncertainty set, where the spatiotemporal elasticity of different types of random workloads are clearly identified and the decision dependencies are explicitly described as linear constraints. Thus, a mixed integer program is then established for the optimal scheduling of both workload demand and energy supply. To enhance system resilience against high volatility scenarios, a rolling horizon algorithm is developed to ensure nonanticipativity and full-scenario feasibility. Numerical tests demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits effective workload scheduling decisions with dramatic energy operational cost reductions compared to the benchmarks under most of the uncertain scenarios.

Title: Robust HRRP Recognition under Interrupted Sampling Repeater Jamming using a Prior Jamming Information-Guided Network
Authors: Guozheng Sun, Lei Wang, Yanhao Wang, Jie Wang, Yimin Liu
Abstract: Radar automatic target recognition (RATR) based on high-resolution range profile (HRRP) has attracted increasing attention due to its ability to capture fine-grained structural features. However, recognizing targets under electronic countermeasures (ECM), especially the mainstream interrupted-sampling repeater jamming (ISRJ), remains a significant challenge, as HRRPs often suffer from serious feature distortion. To address this, we propose a robust HRRP recognition method guided by prior jamming information. Specifically, we introduce a point spread function (PSF) as prior information to model the HRRP distortion induced by ISRJ. Based on this, we design a recognition network that leverages this prior through a prior-guided feature interaction module and a hybrid loss function to enhance the model's discriminative capability. With the aid of prior information, the model can learn invariant features within distorted HRRP under different jamming parameters. Both the simulated and measured-data experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and exhibits stronger generalization capabilities when facing unseen jamming parameters.

Title: CaFTRA: Frequency-Domain Correlation-Aware Feedback-Free MIMO Transmission and Resource Allocation for 6G and Beyond
Authors: Bo Qian, Hanlin Wu, Jiacheng Chen, Yunting Xu, Xiaoyu Wang, Haibo Zhou, Yusheng Ji
Abstract: The fundamental design of wireless systems toward AI-native 6G and beyond is driven by the need for ever-increasing demand of mobile data traffic, extreme spectral efficiency, and adaptability across diverse service scenarios. To overcome the limitations posed by feedback-based multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) transmission, we propose a novel frequency-domain Correlation-aware Feedback-free MIMO Transmission and Resource Allocation (CaFTRA) framework tailored for fully-decoupled radio access networks (FD-RAN) to meet the emerging requirements of AI-Native 6G and beyond. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), CaFTRA effectively eliminates real-time uplink feedback by predicting channel state information (CSI) based solely on user geolocation. We introduce a Learnable Queries-driven Transformer Network for CSI mapping from user geolocation, which utilizes multi-head attention and learnable query embeddings to accurately capture frequency-domain correlations among resource blocks (RBs), thereby significantly improving the precision of CSI prediction. Once base stations (BSs) adopt feedback-free transmission, their downlink transmission coverage can be significantly expanded due to the elimination of frequent uplink feedback. To enable efficient resource scheduling under such extensive-coverage scenarios, we apply a low-complexity many-to-one matching theory-based algorithm for efficient multi-BS association and multi-RB resource allocation, which is proven to converge to a stable matching within limited iterations. Simulation results demonstrate that CaFTRA achieves stable matching convergence and significant gains in spectral efficiency and user fairness compared to 5G, underscoring its potential value for 6G standardization efforts.

Title: An Information Theory of Finite Abstractions and their Fundamental Scalability Limits
Authors: Giannis Delimpaltadakis, Gabriel Gleizer
Abstract: Finite abstractions are discrete approximations of dynamical systems, such that the set of abstraction trajectories contains, in a formal sense, all system trajectories. There is a consensus that abstractions suffer from the curse of dimensionality: for the same ``accuracy" (how closely the abstraction represents the system), the abstraction size scales poorly with system dimensions. And, yet, after decades of research on abstractions, there are no formal results concerning their accuracy-size tradeoff. In this work, we derive a statistical, quantitative theory of abstractions' accuracy-size tradeoff and uncover fundamental limits on their scalability, through rate-distortion theory -- the branch of information theory studying lossy compression. Abstractions are viewed as encoder-decoder pairs, encoding trajectories of dynamical systems in a higher-dimensional ambient space. Rate represents abstraction size, while distortion describes abstraction accuracy, defined as the spatial average deviation between abstract trajectories and system ones. We obtain a fundamental lower bound on the minimum abstraction distortion, given the system dynamics and a threshold on abstraction size. The bound depends on the complexity of the dynamics, through generalized entropy. We demonstrate the bound's tightness on certain dynamical systems. Finally, we showcase how the developed theory can be employed to construct optimal abstractions, in terms of the size-accuracy tradeoff, through an example on a chaotic system.

Title: Digital requirements engineering with an INCOSE-derived SysML meta-model
Authors: James S. Wheaton, Daniel R. Herber
Abstract: Traditional requirements engineering tools do not readily access the SysML-defined system architecture model, often resulting in ad-hoc duplication of model elements that lacks the connectivity and expressive detail possible in a SysML-defined model. Further integration of requirements engineering activities with MBSE contributes to the Authoritative Source of Truth while facilitating deep access to system architecture model elements for V&V activities. We explore the application of MBSE to requirements engineering by extending the Model-Based Structured Requirement SysML Profile to comply with the INCOSE Guide to Writing Requirements while conforming to the ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 standard requirement statement patterns. Rules, Characteristics, and Attributes were defined in SysML according to the Guide to facilitate requirements definition, verification & validation. The resulting SysML Profile was applied in two system architecture models at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, allowing us to assess its applicability and value in real-world project environments. Initial results indicate that INCOSE-derived Model-Based Structured Requirements may rapidly improve requirement expression quality while complementing the NASA Systems Engineering Handbook checklist and guidance, but typical requirement management activities still have challenges related to automation and support in the system architecture modeling software.

Title: EmbedGenius: Towards Automated Software Development for Generic Embedded IoT Systems
Authors: Huanqi Yang, Mingzhe Li, Mingda Han, Zhenjiang Li, Weitao Xu
Abstract: Embedded IoT system development is crucial for enabling seamless connectivity and functionality across a wide range of applications. However, such a complex process requires cross-domain knowledge of hardware and software and hence often necessitates direct developer involvement, making it labor-intensive, time-consuming, and error-prone. To address this challenge, this paper introduces EmbedGenius, the first fully automated software development platform for general-purpose embedded IoT systems. The key idea is to leverage the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and embedded system expertise to automate the hardware-in-the-loop development process. The main methods include a component-aware library resolution method for addressing hardware dependencies, a library knowledge generation method that injects utility domain knowledge into LLMs, and an auto-programming method that ensures successful deployment. We evaluate EmbedGenius's performance across 71 modules and four mainstream embedded development platforms with over 350 IoT tasks. Experimental results show that EmbedGenius can generate codes with an accuracy of 95.7% and complete tasks with a success rate of 86.5%, surpassing human-in-the-loop baselines by 15.6%--37.7% and 25.5%--53.4%, respectively. We also show EmbedGenius's potential through case studies in environmental monitoring and remote control systems development.

Title: VoLUT: Efficient Volumetric streaming enhanced by LUT-based super-resolution
Authors: Chendong Wang, Anlan Zhang, Yifan Yang, Lili Qiu, Yuqing Yang, Xinyang Jiang, Feng Qian, Suman Banerjee
Abstract: 3D volumetric video provides immersive experience and is gaining traction in digital media. Despite its rising popularity, the streaming of volumetric video content poses significant challenges due to the high data bandwidth requirement. A natural approach to mitigate the bandwidth issue is to reduce the volumetric video's data rate by downsampling the content prior to transmission. The video can then be upsampled at the receiver's end using a super-resolution (SR) algorithm to reconstruct the high-resolution details. While super-resolution techniques have been extensively explored and advanced for 2D video content, there is limited work on SR algorithms tailored for volumetric videos. To address this gap and the growing need for efficient volumetric video streaming, we have developed VoLUT with a new SR algorithm specifically designed for volumetric content. Our algorithm uniquely harnesses the power of lookup tables (LUTs) to facilitate the efficient and accurate upscaling of low-resolution volumetric data. The use of LUTs enables our algorithm to quickly reference precomputed high-resolution values, thereby significantly reducing the computational complexity and time required for upscaling. We further apply adaptive video bit rate algorithm (ABR) to dynamically determine the downsampling rate according to the network condition and stream the selected video rate to the receiver. Compared to related work, VoLUT is the first to enable high-quality 3D SR on commodity mobile devices at line-rate. Our evaluation shows VoLUT can reduce bandwidth usage by 70% , boost QoE by 36.7% for volumetric video streaming and achieve 3D SR speed-up with no quality compromise.

Title: System-level Analysis of Dual-Mode Networked Sensing: ISAC Integration & Coordination Gains
Authors: Yasser Nabil, Hesham ElSawy, Hossam S. Hassanein
Abstract: This paper characterizes integration and coordination gains in dense millimeter-wave ISAC networks through a dual-mode framework that combines monostatic and multistatic sensing. A comprehensive system-level analysis is conducted, accounting for base station (BS) density, power allocation, antenna misalignment, radar cross-section (RCS) fluctuations, clutter, bistatic geometry, channel fading, and self-interference cancellation (SIC) efficiency. Using stochastic geometry, coverage probabilities and ergodic rates for sensing and communication are derived, revealing tradeoffs among BS density, beamwidth, and power allocation. It is shown that the communication performance sustained reliable operation despite the overlaid sensing functionality. In contrast, the results reveal the foundational role of spatial sensing diversity, driven by the dual-mode operation, to compensate for the weak sensing reflections and vulnerability to imperfect SIC along with interference and clutter. To this end, we identify a system transition from monostatic to multistatic-dominant sensing operation as a function of the SIC efficiency. In the latter case, using six multistatic BSs instead of a single bistatic receiver improved sensing coverage probability by over 100%, highlighting the coordination gain. Moreover, comparisons with pure communication networks confirm substantial integration gain. Specifically, dual-mode networked sensing with four cooperative BSs can double throughput, while multistatic sensing alone improves throughput by over 50%.

Title: Entropic Analysis of Time Series through Kernel Density Estimation
Authors: Audun Myers, Bill Kay, Iliana Alvarez, Michael Hughes, Cameron Mackenzie, Carlos Ortiz Marrero, Emily Ellwein, Erik Lentz
Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for time series analysis using entropic measures based on the kernel density estimate (KDE) of the time series' Takens' embeddings. Using this framework we introduce two distinct analytical tools: (1) a multi-scale KDE entropy metric, denoted as $\Delta\text{KE}$, which quantifies the evolution of time series complexity across different scales by measuring certain entropy changes, and (2) a sliding baseline method that employs the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to detect changes in time series dynamics through changes in KDEs. The $\Delta{\rm KE}$ metric offers insights into the information content and ``unfolding'' properties of the time series' embedding related to dynamical systems, while the KL divergence-based approach provides a noise and outlier robust approach for identifying time series change points (injections in RF signals, e.g.). We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of these tools through a set of experiments encompassing diverse domains. In the space of radio frequency (RF) signal processing, we achieve accurate detection of signal injections under varying noise and interference conditions. Furthermore, we apply our methodology to electrocardiography (ECG) data, successfully identifying instances of ventricular fibrillation with high accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our tools for dynamic state detection by accurately identifying chaotic regimes within an intermittent signal. These results show the broad applicability of our framework for extracting meaningful insights from complex time series data across various scientific disciplines.

Title: Dual-Objective Reinforcement Learning with Novel Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Formulations
Authors: William Sharpless, Dylan Hirsch, Sander Tonkens, Nikhil Shinde, Sylvia Herbert
Abstract: Hard constraints in reinforcement learning (RL) often degrade policy performance. Lagrangian methods offer a way to blend objectives with constraints, but require intricate reward engineering and parameter tuning. In this work, we extend recent advances that connect Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations with RL to propose two novel value functions for dual-objective satisfaction. Namely, we address: 1) the Reach-Always-Avoid (RAA) problem -- of achieving distinct reward and penalty thresholds -- and 2) the Reach-Reach (RR) problem -- of achieving thresholds of two distinct rewards. In contrast with temporal logic approaches, which typically involve representing an automaton, we derive explicit, tractable Bellman forms in this context via decomposition. Specifically, we prove that the RAA and RR problems may be rewritten as compositions of previously studied HJ-RL problems. We leverage our analysis to propose a variation of Proximal Policy Optimization (DOHJ-PPO), and demonstrate that it produces distinct behaviors from previous approaches, outcompeting a number of baselines in success, safety and speed across a range of tasks for safe-arrival and multi-target achievement.

Title: Deep Feature-specific Imaging
Authors: Yizhou Lu, Andreas Velten
Abstract: Modern photon-counting sensors are increasingly dominated by Poisson noise, yet conventional Feature-Specific Imaging (FSI) is optimized for additive Gaussian noise, leading to suboptimal performance and a loss of its advantages under Poisson noise. To address this, we introduce DeepFSI, a novel end-to-end optical-electronic framework. DeepFSI "unfreezes" traditional FSI masks, enabling a deep neural network to learn globally optimal measurement masks by computing gradients directly under realistic Poisson and additive noise conditions. Our simulations demonstrate DeepFSI's superior feature fidelity and task performance compared to conventional FSI with predefined masks, especially in Poisson-Noise-dominant environments. DeepFSI also exhibits enhanced robustness to design choices and performs well under additive Gaussian noise, representing a significant advance for noise-robust computational imaging in photon-limited applications.

Title: BrainPath: A Biologically-Informed AI Framework for Individualized Aging Brain Generation
Authors: Yifan Li, Javad Sohankar, Ji Luo, Jing Li, Yi Su
Abstract: The global population is aging rapidly, and aging is a major risk factor for various diseases. It is an important task to predict how each individual's brain will age, as the brain supports many human functions. This capability can greatly facilitate healthcare automation by enabling personalized, proactive intervention and efficient healthcare resource allocation. However, this task is extremely challenging because of the brain's complex 3D anatomy. While there have been successes in natural image generation and brain MRI synthesis, existing methods fall short in generating individualized, anatomically faithful aging brain trajectories. To address these gaps, we propose BrainPath, a novel AI model that, given a single structural MRI of an individual, generates synthetic longitudinal MRIs that represent that individual's expected brain anatomy as they age. BrainPath introduces three architectural innovations: an age-aware encoder with biologically grounded supervision, a differential age conditioned decoder for anatomically faithful MRI synthesis, and a swap-learning strategy that implicitly separates stable subject-specific anatomy from aging effects. We further design biologically informed loss functions, including an age calibration loss and an age and structural perceptual loss, to complement the conventional reconstruction loss. This enables the model to capture subtle, temporally meaningful anatomical changes associated with aging. We apply BrainPath to two of the largest public aging datasets and conduct a comprehensive, multifaceted evaluation. Our results demonstrate BrainPath's superior performance in generation accuracy, anatomical fidelity, and cross-dataset generalizability, outperforming competing methods.

Title: MelTok: 2D Tokenization for Single-Codebook Audio Compression
Authors: Jingyi Li, Zhiyuan Zhao, Zhisheng Zhang, Yunfei Liu, Lijian Lin, Ye Zhu, Jiahao Wu, Qiuqiang Kong, Yu Li
Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have emerged with strong performance across diverse audio understanding tasks and can be further enhanced by neural audio codecs. Transitioning from multi-layer residual vector quantizers to a single-layer quantizer has been shown to facilitate more efficient downstream language models decoding. However, the ability of a single codebook to capture fine-grained acoustic details remains limited, as the frequency-variant nature of 1D tokenizers leads to redundancy. To address this issue, we propose MelTok, a two-dimensional (2D) tokenizer that effectively compresses acoustic details of 44.1 KHz audio into a single codebook. The tokenizer encodes audio into a more compact representation than one-dimensional tokenizers. Furthermore, to recover audio from mel-spectrogram tokens, we propose a token-based vocoder. Both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that MelTok achieves quality comparable to multi-codebook codecs and outperforms existing state-of-the-art neural codecs with a single codebook on high-fidelity audio reconstruction. By preserving acoustic details, MelTok offers a strong representation for downstream understanding tasks.

Title: An Accelerated Distributed Optimization with Equality and Inequality Coupling Constraints
Authors: Chenyang Qiu, Yangyang Qian, Zongli Lin, Yacov A. Shamash
Abstract: This paper studies distributed convex optimization with both affine equality and nonlinear inequality couplings through the duality analysis. We first formulate the dual of the coupling-constraint problem and reformulate it as a consensus optimization problem over a connected network. To efficiently solve this dual problem and hence the primal problem, we design an accelerated linearized algorithm that, at each round, a look-ahead linearization of the separable objective is combined with a quadratic penalty on the Laplacian constraint, a proximal step, and an aggregation of iterations. On the theory side, we prove non-ergodic rates for both the primal optimality error and the feasibility error. On the other hand, numerical experiments show a faster decrease of optimality error and feasibility residual than augmented-Lagrangian tracking and distributed subgradient baselines under the same communication budget.

Title: Head, posture, and full-body gestures in dyadic conversations
Authors: Ľuboš Hládek, Bernhard U. Seeber
Abstract: When face-to-face communication becomes effortful due to background noise and interfering talkers, the role of visual cues becomes increasingly important for communication success. While previous research has selectively investigated head or hand movements, here we explore the combination of movements of head, hand and the whole body in acoustically adverse conditions. We hypothesize that with increasing background noise level, the frequency of typical conversational movements of hand, head, trunk, and legs increases to support the speakers role while the listeners support their role by increased use of confirmative head gestures and head and trunk movements to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. We conducted a dyadic conversation experiment in which (n=8) normal hearing participants stood freely in an audiovisual virtual environment. The conversational movements were described by a newly developed labeling system for typical conversational movements, and the frequency of individual types was analyzed. Increased levels of background noise led to increased hand-gesture complexity and modulation of head movements without a clear pattern. People leaned forward slightly more and used less head movements during listening than during speaking. Additional analysis of hand-speech synchrony with hypothesized loss of synchrony due to the background noise showed a modest decrease of synchrony in terms of increased standard deviation at moderate sound levels. The results support previous findings in terms of the gesturing frequency, and we found a limited support for the changes in speech-gesture synchrony. The work reveals communication patterns of the whole body and exemplifies interactive communication in context of multimodal adaptation to communication needs.

Title: Algorithms for Boolean Matrix Factorization using Integer Programming and Heuristics
Authors: Christos Kolomvakis, Thomas Bobille, Arnaud Vandaele, Nicolas Gillis
Abstract: Boolean matrix factorization (BMF) approximates a given binary input matrix as the product of two smaller binary factors. Unlike binary matrix factorization based on standard arithmetic, BMF employs the Boolean OR and AND operations for the matrix product, which improves interpretability and reduces the approximation error. It is also used in role mining and computer vision. In this paper, we first propose algorithms for BMF that perform alternating optimization (AO) of the factor matrices, where each subproblem is solved via integer programming (IP). We then design different approaches to further enhance AO-based algorithms by selecting an optimal subset of rank-one factors from multiple runs. To address the scalability limits of IP-based methods, we introduce new greedy and local-search heuristics. We also construct a new C++ data structure for Boolean vectors and matrices that is significantly faster than existing ones and is of independent interest, allowing our heuristics to scale to large datasets. We illustrate the performance of all our proposed methods and compare them with the state of the art on various real datasets, both with and without missing data, including applications in topic modeling and imaging.
