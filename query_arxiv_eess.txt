Title: MK-SGC-SC: Multiple Kernel guided Sparse Graph Construction in Spectral Clustering for Unsupervised Speaker Diarization
Authors: Nikhil Raghav, Avisek Gupta, Swagatam Das, Md Sahidullah
Abstract: Speaker diarization aims to segment audio recordings into regions corresponding to individual speakers. Although unsupervised speaker diarization is inherently challenging, the prospect of identifying speaker regions without pretraining or weak supervision motivates research on clustering techniques. In this work, we share the notable observation that measuring multiple kernel similarities of speaker embeddings to thereafter craft a sparse graph for spectral clustering in a principled manner is sufficient to achieve state-of-the-art performances in a fully unsupervised setting. Specifically, we consider four polynomial kernels and a degree one arccosine kernel to measure similarities in speaker embeddings, using which sparse graphs are constructed in a principled manner to emphasize local similarities. Experiments show the proposed approach excels in unsupervised speaker diarization over a variety of challenging environments in the DIHARD-III, AMI, and VoxConverse corpora. To encourage further research, our implementations are available at this https URL.

Title: RIR-Mega-Speech: A Reverberant Speech Corpus with Comprehensive Acoustic Metadata and Reproducible Evaluation
Authors: Mandip Goswami
Abstract: Despite decades of research on reverberant speech, comparing methods remains difficult because most corpora lack per-file acoustic annotations or provide limited documentation for reproduction. We present RIR-Mega-Speech, a corpus of approximately 117.5 hours created by convolving LibriSpeech utterances with roughly 5,000 simulated room impulse responses from the RIR-Mega collection. Every file includes RT60, direct-to-reverberant ratio (DRR), and clarity index ($C_{50}$) computed from the source RIR using clearly defined, reproducible procedures. We also provide scripts to rebuild the dataset and reproduce all evaluation results. Using Whisper small on 1,500 paired utterances, we measure 5.20% WER (95% CI: 4.69--5.78) on clean speech and 7.70% (7.04--8.35) on reverberant versions, corresponding to a paired increase of 2.50 percentage points (2.06--2.98). This represents a 48% relative degradation. WER increases monotonically with RT60 and decreases with DRR, consistent with prior perceptual studies. While the core finding that reverberation harms recognition is well established, we aim to provide the community with a standardized resource where acoustic conditions are transparent and results can be verified independently. The repository includes one-command rebuild instructions for both Windows and Linux environments.

Title: VoxPrivacy: A Benchmark for Evaluating Interactional Privacy of Speech Language Models
Authors: Yuxiang Wang, Hongyu Liu, Dekun Chen, Xueyao Zhang, Zhizheng Wu
Abstract: As Speech Language Models (SLMs) transition from personal devices to shared, multi-user environments such as smart homes, a new challenge emerges: the model is expected to distinguish between users to manage information flow appropriately. Without this capability, an SLM could reveal one user's confidential schedule to another, a privacy failure we term interactional privacy. Thus, the ability to generate speaker-aware responses becomes essential for SLM safe deployment. Current SLM benchmarks test dialogue ability but overlook speaker identity. Multi-speaker benchmarks check who said what without assessing whether SLMs adapt their responses. Privacy benchmarks focus on globally sensitive data (e.g., bank passwords) while neglecting contextual privacy-sensitive information (e.g., a user's private appointment). To address this gap, we introduce VoxPrivacy, the first benchmark designed to evaluate interactional privacy in SLMs. VoxPrivacy spans three tiers of increasing difficulty, from following direct secrecy commands to proactively protecting privacy. Our evaluation of nine SLMs on a 32-hour bilingual dataset reveals a widespread vulnerability: most open-source models perform close to random chance (around 50% accuracy) on conditional privacy decisions, while even strong closed-source systems fall short on proactive privacy inference. We further validate these findings on Real-VoxPrivacy, a human-recorded subset, confirming that failures observed on synthetic data persist in real speech. Finally, we demonstrate a viable path forward: by fine-tuning on a new 4,000-hour training set, we improve privacy-preserving abilities while maintaining robustness. To support future work, we release the VoxPrivacy benchmark, the large-scale training set, and the fine-tuned model to foster the development of safer and more context-aware SLMs.

Title: Do we really need Self-Attention for Streaming Automatic Speech Recognition?
Authors: Youness Dkhissi (LIUM), Valentin Vielzeuf, Elys Allesiardo, Anthony Larcher (LIUM)
Abstract: Transformer-based architectures are the most used architectures in many deep learning fields like Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision or Speech processing. It may encourage the direct use of Transformers in the constrained tasks, without questioning whether it will yield the same benefits as in standard tasks.  Given specific constraints, it is essential to evaluate the relevance of transformer models. This work questions the suitability of transformers for specific domains. We argue that the high computational requirements and latency issues associated with these models do not align well with streaming applications. Our study promotes the search for alternative strategies to improve efficiency without sacrificing performance.  In light of this observation, our paper critically examines the usefulness of transformer architecture in such constrained environments. As a first attempt, we show that the computational cost for Streaming Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) can be reduced using deformable convolution instead of Self-Attention. Furthermore, we show that Self-Attention mechanisms can be entirely removed and not replaced, without observing significant degradation in the Word Error Rate.

Title: OptAgent: an Agentic AI framework for Intelligent Building Operations
Authors: Zixin Jiang, Weili Xu, Bing Dong
Abstract: The urgent need for building decarbonization calls for a paradigm shift in future autonomous building energy operation, from human-intensive engineering workflows toward intelligent agents that interact with physics-grounded digital environments. This study proposes an end-to-end agentic AI-enabled Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) environment for scalable building energy modeling, simulation, control, and automation. The framework consists of (1) a modular and physics-consistent PIML digital environment spanning building thermal dynamics, Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC), and distributed energy resources (DER) for grid-interactive energy management; and (2) an agentic AI layer with 11 specialist agents and 72 Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools that enable end-to-end execution of multi-step energy analytics. A representative case study demonstrates multi-domain, multi-agent coordination for assessing how system and control upgrades affect energy use, operating cost, thermal comfort, and flexibility. In addition, a large-scale benchmark (about 4000 runs) systematically evaluates workflow performance in terms of accuracy, token consumption, execution time, and inference cost. The results quantify the impacts of intelligence mode design, model size, task complexity, and orchestrator-specialist coordination, and provide key lessons for building future agentic AI systems in real-world building energy applications. This work establishes a scalable, physics-grounded foundation for deploying agentic AI in decarbonized and grid-interactive building operations.

Title: Electromagnetically Consistent Bounds on Information Transfer in Real-World RIS-Parametrized Wireless Channels
Authors: Albert Salmi, Ville Viikari, Philipp del Hougne
Abstract: A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) endows a wireless channel with programmability that can be leveraged to optimize wireless information transfer. While many works study algorithms for optimizing such a programmable channel, relatively little is known about fundamental bounds on the achievable information transfer. In particular, non-trivial bounds that are both electromagnetically consistent (e.g., aware of mutual coupling) and in line with realistic hardware constraints (e.g., few-bit-programmable, potentially lossy loads) are missing. Here, based on a rigorous multiport network model of a single-input single-output (SISO) channel parametrized by 1-bit-programmable RIS elements, we apply a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to derive a fundamental bound on the achievable SISO channel gain enhancement. A bound on the maximum achievable rate of information transfer at a given noise level follows directly from Shannon's theorem. We apply our bound to several numerical and experimental examples of different RIS-parametrized radio environments. Compared to electromagnetically consistent benchmark bounding strategies (a norm-inequality bound and, where applicable, a relaxation to an idealized beyond-diagonal load network for which a global solution exists), we consistently observe that our SDR-based bound is notably tighter. We reach at least 64 % (but often 100 %) of our SDR-based bound with standard discrete optimization techniques. The applicability of our bound to concrete experimental systems makes it valuable to inform wireless practitioners, e.g., to evaluate RIS hardware design choices and algorithms to optimize the RIS configuration. Our work contributes to the development of an electromagnetic information theory for RIS-parametrized channels as well as other programmable wave systems such as dynamic metasurface antennas or real-life beyond-diagonal RISs.

Title: Orthogonal Plane-Wave Transmit-Receive Isotropic-Focusing Micro-Ultrasound (OPTIMUS) with Bias-Switchable Row-Column Arrays
Authors: Darren Dahunsi, Randy Palamar, Tyler Henry, Mohammad Rahim Sobhani, Negar Majidi, Joy Wang, Afshin Kashani Ilkhechi, Roger Zemp
Abstract: High quality structural volumetric imaging is a challenging goal to achieve with modern ultrasound transducers. Matrix probes have limited fields of view and element counts, whereas row-column arrays (RCAs) provide insufficient focusing. In contrast, Top-Orthogonal-to-Bottom-Electrode (TOBE) arrays, also known as bias-switchable RCAs can enable isotropic focusing on par with ideal matrix probes, with a field of view surpassing conventional RCAs. Orthogonal Plane-Wave Transmit-Receive Isotropic-Focusing Micro-Ultrasound (OPTIMUS) is a novel imaging scheme that can use TOBE arrays to achieve nearly isotropic focusing throughout an expansive volume. This approach extends upon a similar volumetric imaging scheme, Hadamard Encoded Row Column Ultrasonic Expansive Scanning (HERCULES), that is even able to image beyond the shadow of the aperture, much like typical 2D matrix probes. We simulate a grid of scatterers to evaluate how the resolution varies across the volume, and validate these simulations experimentally using a commercial calibration phantom. Experimental measurements were done with a custom fabricated TOBE array, custom biasing electronics, and a research ultrasound system. Finally we performed ex-vivo imaging to assess our ability to discern structural tissue information.

Title: T-Mimi: A Transformer-based Mimi Decoder for Real-Time On-Phone TTS
Authors: Haibin Wu, Bach Viet Do, Naveen Suda, Julian Chan, Madhavan C R, Gene-Ping Yang, Yi-Chiao Wu, Naoyuki Kanda, Yossef Adi, Xin Lei, Yue Liu, Florian Metze, Yuzong Liu
Abstract: Neural audio codecs provide promising acoustic features for speech synthesis, with representative streaming codecs like Mimi providing high-quality acoustic features for real-time Text-to-Speech (TTS) applications. However, Mimi's decoder, which employs a hybrid transformer and convolution architecture, introduces significant latency bottlenecks on edge devices due to the the compute intensive nature of deconvolution layers which are not friendly for mobile-CPUs, such as the most representative framework XNNPACK. This paper introduces T-Mimi, a novel modification of the Mimi codec decoder that replaces its convolutional components with a purely transformer-based decoder, inspired by the TS3-Codec architecture. This change dramatically reduces on-device TTS latency from 42.1ms to just 4.4ms. Furthermore, we conduct quantization aware training and derive a crucial finding: the final two transformer layers and the concluding linear layers of the decoder, which are close to the waveform, are highly sensitive to quantization and must be preserved at full precision to maintain audio quality.

Title: Holographic & Channel-Aware Distributed Detection of a Non-cooperative Target
Authors: Domenico Ciuonzo, Alessio Zappone, Marco Di Renzo, Ciro D'Elia
Abstract: This work investigates Distributed Detection (DD) in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), where spatially distributed sensors transmit binary decisions over a shared flat-fading channel. To enhance fusion efficiency, a reconfigurable metasurface is positioned in the near-field of a few receive antennas, enabling a holographic architecture that harnesses large-aperture gains with minimal RF hardware. A generalized likelihood ratio test is derived for fixed metasurface settings, and two low-complexity joint design strategies are proposed to optimize both fusion and metasurface configuration. These suboptimal schemes achieve a balance between performance, complexity, and system knowledge. The goal is to ensure reliable detection of a localized phenomenon at the fusion center, under energy-efficient constraints aligned with IoT requirements. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed holographic fusion, even under simplified designs.

Title: Control systems for synthetic biology and a case-study in cell fate reprogramming
Authors: Domitilla Del Vecchio
Abstract: This paper gives an overview of the use of control systems engineering in synthetic biology, motivated by applications such as cell therapy and cell fate reprogramming for regenerative medicine. A ubiquitous problem in these and other applications is the ability to control the concentration of specific regulatory factors in the cell accurately despite environmental uncertainty and perturbations. The paper describes the origin of these perturbations and how they affect the dynamics of the biomolecular ``plant'' to be controlled. A variety of biomolecular control implementations are then introduced to achieve robustness of the plant's output to perturbations and are grouped into feedback and feedforward control architectures. Although sophisticated control laws can be implemented in a computer today, they cannot be necessarily implemented inside the cell via biomolecular processes. This fact constraints the set of feasible control laws to those realizable through biomolecular processes that can be engineered with synthetic biology. After reviewing biomolecular feedback and feedforward control implementations, mostly focusing on the author's own work, the paper illustrates the application of such control strategies to cell fate reprogramming. Within this context, a master regulatory factor needs to be controlled at a specific level inside the cell in order to reprogram skin cells to pluripotent stem cells. The article closes by highlighting on-going challenges and directions of future research for biomolecular control design.

Title: Coverage Performance Analysis of FAS-enhanced LoRa Wide Area Networks under both Co-SF and Inter-SF Interference
Authors: Gaoze Mu, Yanzhao Hou, Mingjie Chen, Yuanyu Hu, Yongan Zheng, Qimei Cui, Xiaofeng Tao
Abstract: This paper presents an analytical framework for evaluating the coverage performance of the fluid antenna system (FAS)-enhanced LoRa wide-area networks (LoRaWANs). We investigate the effects of large-scale pathloss in LoRaWAN, small-scale fading characterized by FAS, and dense interference (i.e., collision in an ALOHA-based mechanism) arising from randomly deployed end devices (EDs). Both co-spreading factor (co-SF) interference (with the same SF) and inter-SF interference (with different SFs) are introduced into the network, and their differences in physical characteristics are also considered in the analysis. Additionally, simple yet accurate statistical approximations of the FAS channel envelope and power are derived using the extreme-value theorem. Based on the approximated channel expression, the theoretical coverage probability of the proposed FAS-enhanced LoRaWAN is derived. Numerical results validate our analytical approximations by exhibiting close agreement with the exact correlation model. Notably, it is revealed that a FAS with a normalized aperture of 1 times 1 can greatly enhance network performance, in terms of both ED numbers and coverage range.

Title: C-AoEI-Aware Cross-Layer Optimization in Satellite IoT Systems: Balancing Data Freshness and Transmission Efficiency
Authors: Yuhua Zhao, Tiejun Lv, Ke Wang
Abstract: Satellite-based Internet of Things (S-IoT) faces a fundamental trilemma: propagation delay, dynamic fading, and bandwidth scarcity. While Layer-coded Hybrid ARQ (L-HARQ) enhances reliability, its backtracking decoding introduces age ambiguity, undermining the standard Age of Information (AoI) metric and obscuring the critical trade-off between data freshness and transmission efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel cross-layer optimization framework centered on a new metric, the Cross-layer Age of Error Information (C-AoEI). We derive a closed-form expression for C-AoEI, explicitly linking freshness to system parameters, establishing an explicit analytical connection between freshness degradation and channel dynamics. Building on this, we develop a packet-level encoded L-HARQ scheme for multi-GBS scenarios and an adaptive algorithm that jointly optimizes coding and decision thresholds. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework: it achieves 31.8% higher transmission efficiency and 17.2% lower C-AoEI than conventional schemes. The framework also proves robust against inter-cell interference and varying channel conditions, providing a foundation for designing efficient, latency-aware next-generation S-IoT protocols.

Title: WirelessJEPA: A Multi-Antenna Foundation Model using Spatio-temporal Wireless Latent Predictions
Authors: Viet Chu, Omar Mashaal, Hatem Abou-Zeid
Abstract: We propose WirelessJEPA, a novel wireless foundation model (WFM) that uses the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA). WirelessJEPA learns general-purpose representations directly from real-world multi-antenna IQ data by predicting latent representations of masked signal regions. This enables multiple diverse downstream tasks without reliance on carefully engineered contrastive augmentations. To adapt JEPA to wireless signals, we introduce a 2D antenna time representation that reshapes multi-antenna IQ streams into structured grids, allowing convolutional processing with block masking and efficient sparse computation over unmasked patches. Building on this representation, we propose novel spatio temporal mask geometries that encode inductive biases across antennas and time. We evaluate WirelessJEPA across six downstream tasks and demonstrate it's robust performance and strong task generalization. Our results establish that JEPA-based learning as a promising direction for building generalizable WFMs.

Title: A Data-Driven Krasovskii-Based Approach for Safety Controller Design of Time-Delayed Uncertain Polynomial Systems
Authors: Omid Akbarzadeh, MohammadHossein Ashoori, Amy Nejati, Abolfazl Lavaei
Abstract: We develop a data-driven framework for the synthesis of robust Krasovskii control barrier certificates (RK-CBC) and corresponding robust safety controllers (R-SC) for discrete-time input-affine uncertain polynomial systems with unknown dynamics, while explicitly accounting for unknown-but-bounded disturbances and time-invariant delays using only observed input-state data. Although control barrier certificates have been extensively studied for safety analysis of control systems, existing work on unknown systems with time delays, particularly in the presence of disturbances, remains limited. The challenge of safety synthesis for such systems stems from two main factors: first, the system's mathematical model is unavailable; and second, the safety conditions should explicitly incorporate the effects of time delays on system evolution during the synthesis process, while remaining robust to unknown disturbances. To address these challenges, we develop a data-driven framework based on Krasovskii control barrier certificates, extending the classical CBC formulation for delay-free systems to explicitly account for time delays by aggregating delayed components within the barrier construction. The proposed framework relies solely on input-state data collected over a finite time horizon, enabling the direct synthesis of RK-CBC and R-SC from observed trajectories without requiring an explicit system model. The synthesis is cast as a data-driven sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization program, yielding a structured design methodology. As a result, robust safety is guaranteed in the presence of unknown disturbances and time delays over an infinite time horizon. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through three case studies, including two physical systems.

Title: Efficient Trajectory Design and Communication Scheduling for Dual-UAV Jamming-Aided Secure Communication Networks
Authors: Xinran Wang, Peng Wu, Xiaopeng Yuan, Yulin Hu, Anke Schmeink
Abstract: We study dual-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) jamming-aided secure communication networks, in which one UAV delivers confidential data to multiple ground users (GUs), while a cooperative UAV provides protective interference against a ground eavesdropper. To enforce fairness, we maximize the minimum secrecy throughput across GUs by jointly designing trajectories and communication scheduling. The key difficulty lies in the continuous-time nature of UAV trajectories and the tight space-time coupling between the transmitter and the jammer, which jointly render the problem infinite-dimensional and nonconvex. To address these challenges, we characterize, for the first time, the structure of the optimal trajectories and rigorously prove that they follow a collaborative successive hover-and-fly (co-SHF) structure, where the two UAVs visit a limited number of synchronized co-hovering point pairs, and during each flight segment at least one UAV moves at maximum speed. Leveraging this structure, we reformulate the problem into a finite-dimensional form, without loss of optimality, over hovering and turning points, hovering durations, and scheduling. For tractability, we adopt a minimum-distance approximation of continuous anti-collision constraints and employ concave lower bounds on secrecy throughput within a successive convex approximation (SCA) method, which converges and, thanks to the co-SHF reduction in optimization variables and constraints, achieves low computational complexity. Numerical results show that, compared with time-discretization and no-jamming benchmarks, the proposed co-SHF design improves the min-secrecy and user fairness while requiring significantly less runtime.

Title: ASR for Affective Speech: Investigating Impact of Emotion and Speech Generative Strategy
Authors: Ya-Tse Wu, Chi-Chun Lee
Abstract: This work investigates how emotional speech and generative strategies affect ASR performance. We analyze speech synthesized from three emotional TTS models and find that substitution errors dominate, with emotional expressiveness varying across models. Based on these insights, we introduce two generative strategies: one using transcription correctness and another using emotional salience, to construct fine-tuning subsets. Results show consistent WER improvements on real emotional datasets without noticeable degradation on clean LibriSpeech utterances. The combined strategy achieves the strongest gains, particularly for expressive speech. These findings highlight the importance of targeted augmentation for building emotion-aware ASR systems.

Title: Neural Cooperative Reach-While-Avoid Certificates for Interconnected Systems
Authors: Jingyuan Zhou, Haoze Wu, Kaidi Yang
Abstract: Providing formal guarantees for neural network-based controllers in large-scale interconnected systems remains a fundamental challenge. In particular, using neural certificates to capture cooperative interactions and verifying these certificates at scale is crucial for the safe deployment of such controllers. However, existing approaches fall short on both fronts. To address these limitations, we propose neural cooperative reach-while-avoid certificates with Dynamic-Localized Vector Control Lyapunov and Barrier Functions, which capture cooperative dynamics through state-dependent neighborhood structures and provide decentralized certificates for global exponential stability and safety. Based on the certificates, we further develop a scalable training and verification framework that jointly synthesizes controllers and neural certificates via a constrained optimization objective, and leverages a sufficient condition to ensure formal guarantees considering modeling error. To improve scalability, we introduce a structural reuse mechanism to transfer controllers and certificates between substructure-isomorphic systems. The proposed methodology is validated with extensive experiments on multi-robot coordination and vehicle platoons. Results demonstrate that our framework ensures certified cooperative reach-while-avoid while maintaining strong control performance.

Title: Reducing End-to-End Latency of Cause-Effect Chains with Shared Cache Analysis
Authors: Yixuan Zhu, Yinkang Gao, Bo Zhang, Xiaohang Gong, Binze Jiang, Lei Gong, Wenqi Lou, Teng Wang, Chao Wang, Xi Li, Xuehai Zhou
Abstract: Cause-effect chains, as a widely used modeling method in real-time embedded systems, are extensively applied in various safety-critical domains. End-to-end latency, as a key real-time attribute of cause-effect chains, is crucial in many applications. But the analysis of end-to-end latency for cause-effect chains on multicore platforms with shared caches still presents an unresolved issue. Traditional methods typically assume that the worst-case execution time (WCET) of each task in the cause-effect chain is known. However, in the absence of scheduling information, these methods often assume that all shared cache accesses result in misses, leading to an overestimation of WCET and, consequently, affecting the accuracy of end-to-end latency. However, effectively integrating scheduling information into the WCET analysis process of the chains may introduce two challenges: first, how to leverage the structural characteristics of the chains to optimize shared cache analysis, and second, how to improve analysis accuracy while avoiding state space explosion. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel end-to-end latency analysis framework designed for multi-chain systems on multicore platforms with shared caches. This framework extracts scheduling information and structural characteristics of cause-effect chains, constructing fine-grained and scalable inter-core memory access contexts at the basic block level for time-sensitive shared cache analysis. This results in more accurate WCET (TSC-WCET) estimates, which are then used to derive the end-to-end latency. Finally, we conduct experiments on dual-core and quad-core systems with various cache configurations, which show that under certain settings, the average maximum end-to-end latency of cause-effect chains is reduced by up to 34% and 26%.

Title: A Timing-Anomaly Free Dynamic Scheduling on Heterogeneous Systems
Authors: Yixuan Zhu, Yinkang Gao, Lei Gong, Binze Jiang, Xiaohang Gong, Zihan Wang, Cheng Tang, Wenqi Lou, Teng Wang, Chao Wang, Xi Li, Xuehai Zhou
Abstract: Heterogeneous systems commonly adopt dynamic scheduling algorithms to improve resource utilization and enhance scheduling flexibility. However, such flexibility may introduce timing anomalies, wherein locally reduced execution times can lead to an increase in the overall system execution time. This phenomenon significantly complicates the analysis of Worst-Case Response Time (WCRT), rendering conventional analysis either overly pessimistic or unsafe, and often necessitating exhaustive state-space exploration to ensure correctness. To address this challenge, this paper presents the first timing-anomaly-free dynamic scheduling algorithm for heterogeneous systems, referred to as Deterministic Dynamic Execution. It achieves a safe and tight WCRT estimate through a single offline simulation execution. The core idea is to apply deterministic execution constraints, which partially restrict the resource allocation and execution order of tasks at runtime. Based on a formally defined execution progress model for heterogeneous system scheduling, we prove the correctness of the proposed execution constraints and their ability to eliminate timing anomalies. Furthermore, we propose two methods to generate execution constraints. The first method derives execution constraints directly from the execution traces produced by existing scheduling algorithms. The second method is a heuristic-based approach that constructs execution constraints, enabling further reduction of the WCRT. Experimental results on synthetically generated DAG task sets under various system configurations demonstrate that, compared to traditional dynamic scheduling algorithms, our approach not only eliminates timing anomalies but also effectively reduces both the WCRT and response time jitter.

Title: Erasing Your Voice Before It's Heard: Training-free Speaker Unlearning for Zero-shot Text-to-Speech
Authors: Myungjin Lee, Eunji Shin, Jiyoung Lee
Abstract: Modern zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) models offer unprecedented expressivity but also pose serious crime risks, as they can synthesize voices of individuals who never consented. In this context, speaker unlearning aims to prevent the generation of specific speaker identities upon request. Existing approaches, reliant on retraining, are costly and limited to speakers seen in the training set. We present TruS, a training-free speaker unlearning framework that shifts the paradigm from data deletion to inference-time control. TruS steers identity-specific hidden activations to suppress target speakers while preserving other attributes (e.g., prosody and emotion). Experimental results show that TruS effectively prevents voice generation on both seen and unseen opt-out speakers, establishing a scalable safeguard for speech synthesis. The demo and code are available on this http URL.

Title: User Localization via Active Sensing with Electromagnetically Reconfigurable Antennas
Authors: Ruizhi Zhang, Yuchen Zhang, Ying Zhang
Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end deep learning framework for electromagnetically reconfigurable antenna (ERA)-aided user localization with active sensing, where ERAs provide additional electromagnetic reconfigurability to diversify the received measurements and enhance localization informativeness. To balance sensing flexibility and overhead, we adopt a two-timescale design: the digital combiner is updated at each stage, while the ERA patterns are reconfigured at each substage via a spherical-harmonic representation. The proposed mechanism integrates attention-based feature extraction and LSTM-based temporal learning, enabling the system to learn an optimized sensing strategy and progressively refine the UE position estimate from sequential observations. Simulation results show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms conventional digital beamforming-only and single-stage sensing baselines in terms of localization accuracy. These results highlight the effectiveness of ERA-enabled active sensing for user localization in future wireless systems.

Title: Decoding Speech Envelopes from Electroencephalogram with a Contrastive Pearson Correlation Coefficient Loss
Authors: Yayun Liang, Yuanming Zhang, Fei Chen, Jing Lu, Zhibin Lin
Abstract: Recent advances in reconstructing speech envelopes from Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have enabled continuous auditory attention decoding (AAD) in multi-speaker environments. Most Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based envelope reconstruction models are trained to maximize the Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC) between the attended envelope and the reconstructed envelope (attended PCC). While the difference between the attended PCC and the unattended PCC plays an essential role in auditory attention decoding, existing methods often focus on maximizing the attended PCC. We therefore propose a contrastive PCC loss which represents the difference between the attended PCC and the unattended PCC. The proposed approach is evaluated on three public EEG AAD datasets using four DNN architectures. Across many settings, the proposed objective improves envelope separability and AAD accuracy, while also revealing dataset- and architecture-dependent failure cases.

Authors: Sharief Saleh, Satyam Dwivedi, Russ Whiton, Peter Hammarberg, Musa Furkan Keskin, Julia Equi, Hui Chen, Florent Munier, Olof Eriksson, Fredrik Gunnarsson, Fredrik Tufvesson, Henk Wymeersch
Abstract: The rapid advancement of connected and autonomous vehicles has driven a growing demand for precise and reliable positioning systems capable of operating in complex environments. Meeting these demands requires an integrated approach that combines multiple positioning technologies, including wireless-based systems, perception-based technologies, and motion-based sensors. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of wireless-based positioning for vehicular applications, with a focus on satellite-based positioning (such as global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) and low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites), cellular-based positioning (5G and beyond), and IEEE-based technologies (including Wi-Fi, ultrawideband (UWB), Bluetooth, and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications). First, the survey reviews a wide range of vehicular positioning use cases, outlining their specific performance requirements. Next, it explores the historical development, standardization, and evolution of each wireless positioning technology, providing an in-depth categorization of existing positioning solutions and algorithms, and identifying open challenges and contemporary trends. Finally, the paper examines sensor fusion techniques that integrate these wireless systems with onboard perception and motion sensors to enhance positioning accuracy and resilience in real-world conditions. This survey thus offers a holistic perspective on the historical foundations, current advancements, and future directions of wireless-based positioning for vehicular applications, addressing a critical gap in the literature.

Title: Tilt-based Aberration Estimation in Transmission Electron Microscopy
Authors: Jilles S. van Hulst, Erik M. Franken, Bart J. Janssen, W.P.M.H. (Maurice)Heemels, Duarte J. Antunes
Abstract: Transmission electron microscopes (TEMs) enable atomic-scale imaging but suffer from aberrations caused by lens imperfections and environmental conditions, reducing image quality. These aberrations can be compensated by adjusting electromagnetic lenses, but this requires accurate estimates of the aberration coefficients, which can drift over time. This paper introduces a method for the estimation of aberrations in TEM by leveraging the relationship between an induced electron beam tilt and the resulting image shift. The method uses a Kalman filter (KF) to estimate the aberration coefficients from a sequence of image shifts, while accounting for the drift of the aberrations over time. The applied tilt sequence is optimized by minimizing the trace of the predicted error covariance in the KF, which corresponds to the A-optimality criterion in experimental design. We show that this optimization can be performed offline, as the cost criterion is independent of the actual measurements. The resulting non-convex optimization problem is solved using a gradient-based, receding-horizon approach with multi-starts. Additionally, we develop an approach to estimate specimen-dependent noise properties using expectation maximization (EM), which are then used to tailor the tilt pattern optimization to the specific specimen being imaged. The proposed method is validated on a real TEM set-up with several optimized tilt patterns. The results show that optimized patterns significantly outperform naive approaches and that the aberration and drift model accurately captures the underlying physical phenomena. In total, the alignment time is reduced from typically several minutes to less than a minute compared to the state-of-the-art.

Title: SegRap2025: A Benchmark of Gross Tumor Volume and Lymph Node Clinical Target Volume Segmentation for Radiotherapy Planning of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
Authors: Jia Fu, Litingyu Wang, He Li, Zihao Luo, Huamin Wang, Chenyuan Bian, Zijun Gao, Chunbin Gu, Xin Weng, Jianghao Wu, Yicheng Wu, Jin Ye, Linhao Li, Yiwen Ye, Yong Xia, Elias Tappeiner, Fei He, Abdul qayyum, Moona Mazher, Steven A Niederer, Junqiang Chen, Chuanyi Huang, Lisheng Wang, Zhaohu Xing, Hongqiu Wang, Lei Zhu, Shichuan Zhang, Shaoting Zhang, Wenjun Liao, Guotai Wang
Abstract: Accurate delineation of Gross Tumor Volume (GTV), Lymph Node Clinical Target Volume (LN CTV), and Organ-at-Risk (OAR) from Computed Tomography (CT) scans is essential for precise radiotherapy planning in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC). Building upon SegRap2023, which focused on OAR and GTV segmentation using single-center paired non-contrast CT (ncCT) and contrast-enhanced CT (ceCT) scans, the SegRap2025 challenge aims to enhance the generalizability and robustness of segmentation models across imaging centers and modalities. SegRap2025 comprises two tasks: Task01 addresses GTV segmentation using paired CT from the SegRap2023 dataset, with an additional external testing set to evaluate cross-center generalization, and Task02 focuses on LN CTV segmentation using multi-center training data and an unseen external testing set, where each case contains paired CT scans or a single modality, emphasizing both cross-center and cross-modality robustness.

Title: Precoding Design for Multi-User MIMO Joint Communications and Sensing
Authors: Charlotte Muth, Shrinivas Chimmalgi, Laurent Schmalen
Abstract: We investigate precoding for multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) joint communications and sensing (JCAS) systems, taking into account the potential interference between sensing and communication channels. We derive indicators for the sensing and communication performance, i.e., the detection probability and the communication signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) for general input signals. Our results show that the use of the communication signal for sensing can prevent a loss in communication performance if channel interference occurs, while the kurtosis of the transmit alphabet of the communication signal limits the sensing performance. We present simulation results of example setups.

Title: RL based Beamforming Optimization for 3D Pinching Antenna assisted ISAC Systems
Authors: Qian Gao, Ruikang Zhong, Yue Liu, Hyundong Shin, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: In this paper, a three-dimensional (3D) deployment scheme of pinching antenna array is proposed, aiming to enhances the performance of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. To fully realize the potential of 3D deployment, a joint antenna positioning, time allocation and transmit power optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum communication rate with the constraints of target sensing rates and system energy. To solve the sum rate maximization problem, we propose a heterogeneous graph neural network based reinforcement learning (HGRL) algorithm. Simulation results prove that 3D deployment of pinching antenna array outperforms 1D and 2D counterparts in ISAC systems. Moreover, the proposed HGRL algorithm surpasses other baselines in both performance and convergence speed due to the advanced observation construction of the environment.

Title: Integrated Sensing and Communication for Segmented Waveguide-Enabled Pinching Antenna Systems
Authors: Qian Gao, Ruikang Zhong, Hyundong Shin, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: In this paper, an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) design for segmented waveguide-enabled pinching-antenna array (SWAN) systems is proposed to improve the performance of systems by leveraging the low in-waveguide propagation loss of segmented waveguides. The hybrid segment selection and multiplexing (HSSM) protocol is implemented to provide favorable performance with less hardware cost. To achieve this, a joint transmit beamforming optimization, segment selection, and pinching antenna positioning problem is formulated to maximize the sum communication rate with the constraints of sensing performance. To solve the maximization problem, we propose a segment hysteresis based reinforcement learning (SHRL) algorithm to learn segment selection and pinching antenna positions in different progress to explore better strategies. Simulation results demonstrate that 1) the proposed SWAN-ISAC scheme outperforms the other baseline schemes, and 2) the proposed HARL algorithm achieves better performance compared to conventional RL algorithms.

Title: Deep Learning based Three-stage Solution for ISAC Beamforming Optimization
Authors: Qian Gao, Ruikang Zhong, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: In this paper, a general ISAC system where the base station (BS) communicates with multiple users and performs target detection is considered. Then, a sum communication rate maximization problem is formulated, subjected to the constraints of transmit power and the minimum sensing rates of users. To solve this problem, we develop a framework that leverages deep learning algorithms to provide a three-stage solution for ISAC beamforming. The three-stage beamforming optimization solution includes three modules: 1) an unsupervised learning based feature extraction algorithm is proposed to extract fixed-size latent features while keeping its essential information from the variable channel state information (CSI); 2) a reinforcement learning (RL) based beampattern optimization algorithm is proposed to search the desired beampattern according to the extracted features; 3) a supervised learning based beamforming reconstruction algorithm is proposed to reconstruct the beamforming vector from beampattern given by the RL agent. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed three-stage solution outperforms the baseline RL algorithm by optimizing the intuitional beampattern rather than beamforming.

Title: Grover's Search-Inspired Quantum Reinforcement Learning for Massive MIMO User Scheduling
Authors: Ruining Fan, Xingyu Huang, Mouli Chakraborty, Avishek Nag, Anshu Mukherjee
Abstract: The efficient user scheduling policy in the massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (mMIMO) system remains a significant challenge in the field of 5G and Beyond 5G (B5G) due to its high computational complexity, scalability, and Channel State Information (CSI) overhead. This paper proposes a novel Grover's search-inspired Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) framework for mMIMO user scheduling. The QRL agent can explore the exponentially large scheduling space effectively by applying Grover's search to the reinforcement learning process. The model is implemented using our designed quantum-gate-based circuit, which imitates the layered architecture of reinforcement learning, where quantum operations act as policy updates and decision-making units. Moreover, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves proper convergence and significantly outperforms classical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Quantum Deep Learning (QDL) benchmarks.

Title: Task-Based Adaptive Transmit Beamforming for Efficient Ultrasound Quantification
Authors: Oisín Nolan, Wessel L. van Nierop, Louis D. van Harten, Tristan S.W. Stevens, Ruud J.G. van Sloun
Abstract: Wireless and wearable ultrasound devices promise to enable continuous ultrasound monitoring, but power consumption and data throughput remain critical challenges. Reducing the number of transmit events per second directly impacts both. We propose a task-based adaptive transmit beamforming method, formulated as a Bayesian active perception problem, that adaptively chooses where to scan in order to gain information about downstream quantitative measurements, avoiding redundant transmit events. Our proposed Task-Based Information Gain (TBIG) strategy applies to any differentiable downstream task function. When applied to recovering ventricular dimensions from echocardiograms, TBIG recovers accurate results using fewer than 2% of scan lines typically used, showing potential for large reductions in the power usage and data rates necessary for monitoring.

Title: Sequential Processing Strategies in Fronthaul Constrained Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks
Authors: Vida Ranjbar, Robbert Beerten, Marc Moonen, Sofie Pollin
Abstract: In a cell-free massive MIMO (CFmMIMO) network with a daisy-chain fronthaul, the amount of information that each access point (AP) needs to communicate with the next AP in the chain is determined by the location of the AP in the sequential fronthaul. Therefore, we propose two sequential processing strategies to combat the adverse effect of fronthaul compression on the sum of users' spectral efficiency (SE): 1) linearly increasing fronthaul capacity allocation among APs and 2) Two-Path users' signal estimation. The two strategies show superior performance in terms of sum SE compared to the equal fronthaul capacity allocation and Single-Path sequential signal estimation.

Title: Distributed Learning over Noisy Communication Networks
Authors: Emrah Akyol, Marcos Vasconcelos
Abstract: We study binary coordination games over graphs under log-linear learning when neighbor actions are conveyed through explicit noisy communication links. Each edge is modeled as either a binary symmetric channel (BSC) or a binary erasure channel (BEC). We analyze two operational regimes. For binary symmetric and binary erasure channels, we provide a structural characterization of the induced learning dynamics. In a fast-communication regime, agents update using channel-averaged payoffs; the resulting learning dynamics coincide with a Gibbs sampler for a scaled coordination potential, where channel reliability enters only through a scalar attenuation coefficient. In a snapshot regime, agents update from a single noisy realization and ignore channel statistics; the induced Markov chain is generally nonreversible, but admits a high-temperature expansion whose drift matches that of the fast Gibbs sampler with the same attenuation. We further formalize a finite-$K$ communication budget, which interpolates between snapshot and fast behavior as the number of channel uses per update grows. This viewpoint yields a communication-theoretic interpretation in terms of retransmissions and repetition coding, and extends naturally to heterogeneous link reliabilities via effective edge weights. Numerical experiments illustrate the theory and quantify the tradeoff between communication resources and steady-state coordination quality.

Title: Leveraging Second-Order Curvature for Efficient Learned Image Compression: Theory and Empirical Evidence
Authors: Yichi Zhang, Fengqing Zhu
Abstract: Training learned image compression (LIC) models entails navigating a challenging optimization landscape defined by the fundamental trade-off between rate and distortion. Standard first-order optimizers, such as SGD and Adam, struggle with \emph{gradient conflicts} arising from competing objectives, leading to slow convergence and suboptimal rate-distortion performance. In this work, we demonstrate that a simple utilization of a second-order quasi-Newton optimizer, \textbf{SOAP}, dramatically improves both training efficiency and final performance across diverse LICs. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that Newton preconditioning inherently resolves the intra-step and inter-step update conflicts intrinsic to the R-D objective, facilitating faster, more stable convergence. Beyond acceleration, we uncover a critical deployability benefit: second-order trained models exhibit significantly fewer activation and latent outliers. This substantially enhances robustness to post-training quantization. Together, these results establish second-order optimization, achievable as a seamless drop-in replacement of the imported optimizer, as a powerful, practical tool for advancing the efficiency and real-world readiness of LICs.

Title: Multi-Mode Pinching Antenna Systems Enabled Multi-User Communications
Authors: Xiaoxia Xu, Xidong Mu, Yuanwei Liu, Arumugam Nallanathan
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel multi-mode pinching-antenna systems (PASS) framework. Multiple data streams can be transmitted within a single waveguide through multiple guided modes, thus facilitating efficient multi-user communications through the mode-domain multiplexing. A physic model is derived, which reveals the mode-selective power radiation feature of pinching antennas (PAs). A two-mode PASS enabled two-user downlink communication system is investigated. Considering the mode selectivity of PA power radiation, a practical PA grouping scheme is proposed, where each PA group matches with one specific guided mode and mainly radiates its signal sequentially. Depending on whether the guided mode leaks power to unmatched PAs or not, the proposed PA grouping scheme operates in either the non-leakage or weak-leakage regime. Based on this, the baseband beamforming and PA locations are jointly optimized for sum rate maximization, subject to each user's minimum rate requirement. 1) A simple two-PA case in non-leakage regime is first considered. To solve the formulated problem, a channel orthogonality based solution is proposed. The channel orthogonality is ensured by large-scale and wavelength-scale equality constraints on PA locations. Thus, the optimal beamforming reduces to maximum-ratio transmission (MRT). Moreover, the optimal PA locations are obtained via a Newton-based one-dimension search algorithm that enforces two-scale PA-location constraints by Newton's method. 2) A general multi-PA case in both non-leakage and weak-leakage regimes is further considered. A low-complexity particle-swarm optimization with zero-forcing beamforming (PSO-ZF) algorithm is developed, thus effectively tackling the high-oscillatory and strong-coupled problem. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed multi-mode PASS over conventional single-mode PASS and fixed-antenna structures.

Title: AI-Driven Design of Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces for Software-Defined Radio Applications
Authors: Ivan Iudice, Giacinto Gelli, Donatella Darsena
Abstract: The integration of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) into future wireless communication systems offers promising capabilities in dynamic environment shaping and spectrum efficiency. In this work, we present a consistent implementation of a stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) model within the NVIDIA's AI-native framework Sionna for 6G physical layer research. Our implementation allows simulation and learning-based optimization of SIM-assisted communication channels in fully differentiable and GPU-accelerated environments, enabling end-to-end training for cognitive and software-defined radio (SDR) applications. We describe the architecture of the SIM model, including its integration into the TensorFlow-based pipeline, and showcase its use in closed-loop learning scenarios involving adaptive beamforming and dynamic reconfiguration. Benchmarking results are provided for various deployment scenarios, highlighting the model's effectiveness in enabling intelligent control and signal enhancement in non-terrestrial-network (NTN) propagation environments. This work demonstrates a scalable, modular approach for incorporating intelligent metasurfaces into modern AI-accelerated SDR systems and paves the way for future hardware-in-the-loop experiments.

Title: Statistical Properties of Target Localization Using Passive Radar Systems
Authors: Mats Viberg, Daniele Gerosa, Tomas McKelvey, Thomas Eriksson
Abstract: Passive Radar Systems have received tremendous attention during the past few decades, due to their low cost and ability to remain covert during operation. Such systems do not transmit any energy themselves, but rely on a so-called Illuminator-of-Opportunity (IO), for example a commercial TV station. A network of Receiving Nodes (RN) receive the direct signal as well as reflections from possible targets. The RNs transmit information to a Central Node (CN), that performs the final target detection, localization and tracking. A large number of methods and algorithms for target detection and localization have been proposed in the literature. In the present contribution, the focus is on the seminal Extended Cancelation Algorithm (ECA), in which each RN estimates target parameters after canceling interference from the direct-path as well as clutter from unwanted stationary objects. This is done by exploiting a separate Reference Channel (RC), which captures the IO signal without interference apart from receiver noise. We derive the statistical properties of the ECA parameter estimates under the assumption of a high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and we give a sufficient condition for the SNR in the RC to enable statistically efficient estimates. The theoretical results are corroborated through computer simulations, which show that the theory agrees well with empirical results above a certain SNR threshold. The results can be used to predict the performance of passive radar systems in given scenarios, which is useful for feasibility studies as well as system design.

Title: Pianoroll-Event: A Novel Score Representation for Symbolic Music
Authors: Lekai Qian, Haoyu Gu, Dehan Li, Boyu Cao, Qi Liu
Abstract: Symbolic music representation is a fundamental challenge in computational musicology. While grid-based representations effectively preserve pitch-time spatial correspondence, their inherent data sparsity leads to low encoding efficiency. Discrete-event representations achieve compact encoding but fail to adequately capture structural invariance and spatial locality. To address these complementary limitations, we propose Pianoroll-Event, a novel encoding scheme that describes pianoroll representations through events, combining structural properties with encoding efficiency while maintaining temporal dependencies and local spatial patterns. Specifically, we design four complementary event types: Frame Events for temporal boundaries, Gap Events for sparse regions, Pattern Events for note patterns, and Musical Structure Events for musical metadata. Pianoroll-Event strikes an effective balance between sequence length and vocabulary size, improving encoding efficiency by 1.36\times to 7.16\times over representative discrete sequence methods. Experiments across multiple autoregressive architectures show models using our representation consistently outperform baselines in both quantitative and human evaluations.

Title: LTS-VoiceAgent: A Listen-Think-Speak Framework for Efficient Streaming Voice Interaction via Semantic Triggering and Incremental Reasoning
Authors: Wenhao Zou, Yuwei Miao, Zhanyu Ma, Jun Xu, Jiuchong Gao, Jinghua Hao, Renqing He, Jingwen Xu
Abstract: Real-time voice agents face a dilemma: end-to-end models often lack deep reasoning, while cascaded pipelines incur high latency by executing ASR, LLM reasoning, and TTS strictly in sequence, unlike human conversation where listeners often start thinking before the speaker finishes. Since cascaded architectures remain the dominant choice for complex tasks, existing cascaded streaming strategies attempt to reduce this latency via mechanical segmentation (e.g., fixed chunks, VAD-based splitting) or speculative generation, but they frequently either break semantic units or waste computation on predictions that must be rolled back. To address these challenges, we propose LTS-VoiceAgent, a Listen-Think-Speak framework that explicitly separates when to think from how to reason incrementally. It features a Dynamic Semantic Trigger to detect meaningful prefixes, and a Dual-Role Stream Orchestrator that coordinates a background Thinker (for state maintenance) and a foreground Speaker (for speculative solving). This parallel design enables "thinking while speaking" without blocking responses. We also introduce a Pause-and-Repair benchmark containing natural disfluencies to stress-test streaming robustness. Experiments across VERA, Spoken-MQA, BigBenchAudio, and our benchmark show that LTS-VoiceAgent achieves a stronger accuracy-latency-efficiency trade-off than serial cascaded baselines and existing streaming strategies.

Title: Probabilistic Sensing: Intelligence in Data Sampling
Authors: Ibrahim Albulushi, Saleh Bunaiyan, Suraj S. Cheema, Hesham ElSawy, Feras Al-Dirini
Abstract: Extending the intelligence of sensors to the data-acquisition process - deciding whether to sample or not - can result in transformative energy-efficiency gains. However, making such a decision in a deterministic manner involves risk of losing information. Here we present a sensing paradigm that enables making such a decision in a probabilistic manner. The paradigm takes inspiration from the autonomous nervous system and employs a probabilistic neuron (p-neuron) driven by an analog feature extraction circuit. The response time of the system is on the order of microseconds, over-coming the sub-sampling-rate response time limit and enabling real-time intelligent autonomous activation of data-sampling. Validation experiments on active seismic survey data demonstrate lossless probabilistic data acquisition, with a normalized mean squared error of 0.41%, and 93% saving in the active operation time of the system and the number of generated samples.

Title: Scaling Next-Brain-Token Prediction for MEG
Authors: Richard Csaky
Abstract: We present a large autoregressive model for source-space MEG that scales next-token prediction to long context across datasets and scanners: handling a corpus of over 500 hours and thousands of sessions across the three largest MEG datasets. A modified SEANet-style vector-quantizer reduces multichannel MEG into a flattened token stream on which we train a Qwen2.5-VL backbone from scratch to predict the next brain token and to recursively generate minutes of MEG from up to a minute of context. To evaluate long-horizon generation, we introduce three task-matched tests: (i) on-manifold stability via generated-only drift compared to the time-resolved distribution of real sliding windows, and (ii) conditional specificity via correct context versus prompt-swap controls using a neurophysiologically grounded metric set. We train on CamCAN and Omega and run all analyses on held-out MOUS, establishing cross-dataset generalization. Across metrics, generations remain relatively stable over long rollouts and are closer to the correct continuation than swapped controls. Code available at: this https URL.

Title: Mind the Shift: Using Delta SSL Embeddings to Enhance Child ASR
Authors: Zilai Wang, Natarajan Balaji Shankar, Kaiyuan Zhang, Zihan Wang, Abeer Alwan
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) models have achieved impressive results across many speech tasks, yet child automatic speech recognition (ASR) remains challenging due to limited data and pretraining domain mismatch. Fine-tuning SSL models on child speech induces shifts in the representation space. We hypothesize that delta SSL embeddings, defined as the differences between embeddings from a finetuned model and those from its pretrained counterpart, encode task-specific information that complements finetuned features from another SSL model. We evaluate multiple fusion strategies on the MyST childrens corpus using different models. Results show that delta embedding fusion with WavLM yields up to a 10 percent relative WER reduction for HuBERT and a 4.4 percent reduction for W2V2, compared to finetuned embedding fusion. Notably, fusing WavLM with delta W2V2 embeddings achieves a WER of 9.64, setting a new state of the art among SSL models on the MyST corpus. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of delta embeddings and highlight feature fusion as a promising direction for advancing child ASR.

Title: A Taylor Series Approach to Correct Localization Errors in Robotic Field Mapping using Gaussian Processes
Authors: Muzaffar Qureshi, Tochukwu Elijah Ogri, Kyle Volle, Rushikesh Kamalapurkar
Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are powerful non-parametric Bayesian models for regression of scalar fields, formulated under the assumption that measurement locations are perfectly known and the corresponding field measurements have Gaussian noise. However, many real-world scalar field mapping applications rely on sensor-equipped mobile robots to collect field measurements, where imperfect localization introduces state uncertainty. Such discrepancies between the estimated and true measurement locations degrade GP mean and covariance estimates. To address this challenge, we propose a method for updating the GP models when improved estimates become available. Leveraging the differentiability of the kernel function, a second-order correction algorithm is developed using the precomputed Jacobians and Hessians of the GP mean and covariance functions for real-time refinement based on measurement location discrepancy data. Simulation results demonstrate improved prediction accuracy and computational efficiency compared to full model retraining.

Title: Parametric and Generative Forecasts of Day-Ahead Market Curves for Storage Optimization
Authors: Julian Gutierrez, Redouane Silvente
Abstract: We present two machine learning frameworks for forecasting aggregated curves and optimizing storage in the EPEX SPOT day-ahead market. First, a fast parametric model forecasts hourly demand and supply curves in a low-dimensional and grid-robust representation, with minimum and maximum volumes combined with a Chebyshev polynomial for the elastic segment. The model enables daily use with low error and clear interpretability. Second, for a more comprehensive analysis, though less suited to daily operation, we employ generative models that learn the joint distribution of 24-hour order-level submissions given weather and fuel variables. These models generate synthetic daily scenarios of individual buy and sell orders, which, once aggregated, yield hourly supply and demand curves. Based on these forecasts, we optimize a price-making storage strategy, quantify revenue distributions, and highlight the price-compression effect with lower peaks, higher off-peak levels, and diminishing returns as capacity expands.

Title: A Learning-based Framework for Spatial Impulse Response Compensation in 3D Photoacoustic Computed Tomography
Authors: Kaiyi Yang, Seonyeong Park, Gangwon Jeong, Hsuan-Kai Huang, Alexander A. Oraevsky, Umberto Villa, Mark A. Anastasio
Abstract: Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is a promising imaging modality that combines the advantages of optical contrast with ultrasound detection. Utilizing ultrasound transducers with larger surface areas can improve detection sensitivity. However, when computationally efficient analytic reconstruction methods that neglect the spatial impulse responses (SIRs) of the transducer are employed, the spatial resolution of the reconstructed images will be compromised. Although optimization-based reconstruction methods can explicitly account for SIR effects, their computational cost is generally high, particularly in three-dimensional (3D) applications. To address the need for accurate but rapid 3D PACT image reconstruction, this study presents a framework for establishing a learned SIR compensation method that operates in the data domain. The learned compensation method maps SIR-corrupted PACT measurement data to compensated data that would have been recorded by idealized point-like transducers. Subsequently, the compensated data can be used with a computationally efficient reconstruction method that neglects SIR effects. Two variants of the learned compensation model are investigated that employ a U-Net model and a specifically designed, physics-inspired model, referred to as Deconv-Net. A fast and analytical training data generation procedure is also a component of the presented framework. The framework is rigorously validated in virtual imaging studies, demonstrating resolution improvement and robustness to noise variations, object complexity, and sound speed heterogeneity. When applied to in-vivo breast imaging data, the learned compensation models revealed fine structures that had been obscured by SIR-induced artifacts. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of learned SIR compensation in 3D PACT imaging.

Title: MiLorE-SSL: Scaling Multilingual Capabilities in Self-Supervised Models without Forgetting
Authors: Jing Xu, Minglin Wu, Xueyuan Chen, Xixin Wu, Helen Meng
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has greatly advanced speech representation learning, but multilingual SSL models remain constrained to languages encountered during pretraining. Retraining from scratch to incorporate new languages is computationally expensive, while sequential training without migitation strategies often leads to catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose MiLorE-SSL, a lightweight framework that combines LoRA modules with a soft mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism for efficient continual multilingual training. LoRA provides efficient low-rank adaptation, while soft MoE promotes flexible expert sharing across languages, reducing cross-lingual interference. To further mitigate forgetting, we introduce limited replay data from existing languages, avoiding reliance on large historical corpora. Experiments on ML-SUPERB demonstrate that MiLorE-SSL achieves strong performance in new languages and improves the ability in existing ones with only 2.14% trainable parameters.

Title: Decentralized Stochastic Constrained Optimization via Prox-Linearization
Authors: Shivangi Dubey Sharma, Basil M. Idrees, Lavish Arora, Ketan Rajawat
Abstract: This paper studies consensus-based decentralized stochastic optimization for minimizing possibly non-convex expected objectives with convex non-smooth regularizers and nonlinear functional inequality constraints. We reformulate the constrained problem using the exact-penalty model and develop two algorithms that require only local stochastic gradients and first-order constraint information. The first method, Decentralized Stochastic Momentum-based Prox-Linear Algorithm (D-SMPL), combines constraint linearization with a prox-linear step, resulting in a linearly constrained quadratic subproblem per iteration. Building on this approach, we propose a successive convex approximation (SCA) variant, Decentralized SCA Momentum-based Prox-Linear (D-SCAMPL), which handles additional objective structure through strongly convex surrogate subproblems while still allowing infeasible initialization. Both methods incorporate recursive momentum-based gradient estimators and a consensus mechanism requiring only two communication rounds per iteration. Under standard smoothness and regularity assumptions, both algorithms achieve an oracle complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3/2})$, matching the optimal rate known for unconstrained centralized stochastic non-convex optimization. Numerical experiments on energy-optimal ocean trajectory planning corroborate the theory and demonstrate improved performance over existing decentralized baselines.

Title: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction via Transformer-Based Models
Authors: Qing Lyu, Zhe Fu, Alexandre Bayen
Abstract: Identifying safety-critical scenarios is essential for autonomous driving, but the rarity of such events makes supervised labeling impractical. Traditional rule-based metrics like Time-to-Collision are too simplistic to capture complex interaction risks, and existing methods lack a systematic way to verify whether statistical anomalies truly reflect physical danger. To address this gap, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection framework based on a multi-agent Transformer that models normal driving and measures deviations through prediction residuals. A dual evaluation scheme has been proposed to assess both detection stability and physical alignment: Stability is measured using standard ranking metrics in which Kendall Rank Correlation Coefficient captures rank agreement and Jaccard index captures the consistency of the top-K selected items; Physical alignment is assessed through correlations with established Surrogate Safety Measures (SSM). Experiments on the NGSIM dataset demonstrate our framework's effectiveness: We show that the maximum residual aggregator achieves the highest physical alignment while maintaining stability. Furthermore, our framework identifies 388 unique anomalies missed by Time-to-Collision and statistical baselines, capturing subtle multi-agent risks like reactive braking under lateral drift. The detected anomalies are further clustered into four interpretable risk types, offering actionable insights for simulation and testing.

Title: RF-MatID: Dataset and Benchmark for Radio Frequency Material Identification
Authors: Xinyan Chen, Qinchun Li, Ruiqin Ma, Jiaqi Bai, Li Yi, Jianfei Yang
Abstract: Accurate material identification plays a crucial role in embodied AI systems, enabling a wide range of applications. However, current vision-based solutions are limited by the inherent constraints of optical sensors, while radio-frequency (RF) approaches, which can reveal intrinsic material properties, have received growing attention. Despite this progress, RF-based material identification remains hindered by the lack of large-scale public datasets and the limited benchmarking of learning-based approaches. In this work, we present RF-MatID, the first open-source, large-scale, wide-band, and geometry-diverse RF dataset for fine-grained material identification. RF-MatID includes 16 fine-grained categories grouped into 5 superclasses, spanning a broad frequency range from 4 to 43.5 GHz, and comprises 142k samples in both frequency- and time-domain representations. The dataset systematically incorporates controlled geometry perturbations, including variations in incidence angle and stand-off distance. We further establish a multi-setting, multi-protocol benchmark by evaluating state-of-the-art deep learning models, assessing both in-distribution performance and out-of-distribution robustness under cross-angle and cross-distance shifts. The 5 frequency-allocation protocols enable systematic frequency- and region-level analysis, thereby facilitating real-world deployment. RF-MatID aims to enable reproducible research, accelerate algorithmic advancement, foster cross-domain robustness, and support the development of real-world application in RF-based material identification.

Title: Audio Deepfake Detection in the Age of Advanced Text-to-Speech models
Authors: Robin Singh, Aditya Yogesh Nair, Fabio Palumbo, Florian Barbaro, Anna Dyka, Lohith Rachakonda
Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems have substantially increased the realism of synthetic speech, raising new challenges for audio deepfake detection. This work presents a comparative evaluation of three state-of-the-art TTS models--Dia2, Maya1, and MeloTTS--representing streaming, LLM-based, and non-autoregressive architectures. A corpus of 12,000 synthetic audio samples was generated using the Daily-Dialog dataset and evaluated against four detection frameworks, including semantic, structural, and signal-level approaches. The results reveal significant variability in detector performance across generative mechanisms: models effective against one TTS architecture may fail against others, particularly LLM-based synthesis. In contrast, a multi-view detection approach combining complementary analysis levels demonstrates robust performance across all evaluated models. These findings highlight the limitations of single-paradigm detectors and emphasize the necessity of integrated detection strategies to address the evolving landscape of audio deepfake threats.

Title: Vibro-Sense: Robust Vibration-based Impulse Response Localization and Trajectory Tracking for Robotic Hands
Authors: Wadhah Zai El Amri, Nicolás Navarro-Guerrero
Abstract: Rich contact perception is crucial for robotic manipulation, yet traditional tactile skins remain expensive and complex to integrate. This paper presents a scalable alternative: high-accuracy whole-body touch localization via vibro-acoustic sensing. By equipping a robotic hand with seven low-cost piezoelectric microphones and leveraging an Audio Spectrogram Transformer, we decode the vibrational signatures generated during physical interaction. Extensive evaluation across stationary and dynamic tasks reveals a localization error of under 5 mm in static conditions. Furthermore, our analysis highlights the distinct influence of material properties: stiff materials (e.g., metal) excel in impulse response localization due to sharp, high-bandwidth responses, whereas textured materials (e.g., wood) provide superior friction-based features for trajectory tracking. The system demonstrates robustness to the robot's own motion, maintaining effective tracking even during active operation. Our primary contribution is demonstrating that complex physical contact dynamics can be effectively decoded from simple vibrational signals, offering a viable pathway to widespread, affordable contact perception in robotics. To accelerate research, we provide our full datasets, models, and experimental setups as open-source resources.

Title: Quantitative synthetic aperture radar inversion
Authors: Liliana Borcea, Josselin Garnier, Alexander V. Mamonov, Jörn Zimmerling
Abstract: We study an inverse scattering problem for monostatic synthetic aperture radar (SAR): Estimate the wave speed in a heterogeneous, isotropic and nonmagnetic medium probed by waves emitted and measured by a moving antenna. The forward map, from the wave speed to the measurements, is derived from Maxwell's equations. It is a nonlinear map that accounts for multiple scattering and it is very oscillatory at high frequencies. This makes the standard, nonlinear least squares data fitting formulation of the inverse problem difficult to solve. We introduce an alternative, two-step approach: The first step computes the nonlinear map from the measurements to an approximation of the electric field inside the unknown medium aka, the internal wave. This is done for each antenna location in a non-iterative manner. The internal wave fits the data by construction, but it does not solve Maxwell's equations. The second step uses optimization to minimize the discrepancy between the internal wave and the solution of Maxwell's equations, for all antenna locations. The optimization is iterative. The first step defines an imaging function whose computational cost is comparable to that of standard SAR imaging, but it gives a better estimate of the support of targets. Further iterations improve the quantitative estimation of the wave speed. We assess the performance of the method with numerical simulations and compare the results with those of standard inversion.

Title: Learning Contextual Runtime Monitors for Safe AI-Based Autonomy
Authors: Alejandro Luque-Cerpa, Mengyuan Wang, Emil Carlsson, Sanjit A. Seshia, Devdatt Dubhashi, Hazem Torfah
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for learning context-aware runtime monitors for AI-based control ensembles. Machine-learning (ML) controllers are increasingly deployed in (autonomous) cyber-physical systems because of their ability to solve complex decision-making tasks. However, their accuracy can degrade sharply in unfamiliar environments, creating significant safety concerns. Traditional ensemble methods aim to improve robustness by averaging or voting across multiple controllers, yet this often dilutes the specialized strengths that individual controllers exhibit in different operating contexts. We argue that, rather than blending controller outputs, a monitoring framework should identify and exploit these contextual strengths. In this paper, we reformulate the design of safe AI-based control ensembles as a contextual monitoring problem. A monitor continuously observes the system's context and selects the controller best suited to the current conditions. To achieve this, we cast monitor learning as a contextual learning task and draw on techniques from contextual multi-armed bandits. Our approach comes with two key benefits: (1) theoretical safety guarantees during controller selection, and (2) improved utilization of controller diversity. We validate our framework in two simulated autonomous driving scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in both safety and performance compared to non-contextual baselines.

Title: SA-PEF: Step-Ahead Partial Error Feedback for Efficient Federated Learning

Abstract: Biased gradient compression with error feedback (EF) reduces communication in federated learning (FL), but under non-IID data, the residual error can decay slowly, causing gradient mismatch and stalled progress in the early rounds. We propose step-ahead partial error feedback (SA-PEF), which integrates step-ahead (SA) correction with partial error feedback (PEF). SA-PEF recovers EF when the step-ahead coefficient $\alpha=0$ and step-ahead EF (SAEF) when $\alpha=1$. For non-convex objectives and $\delta$-contractive compressors, we establish a second-moment bound and a residual recursion that guarantee convergence to stationarity under heterogeneous data and partial client participation. The resulting rates match standard non-convex Fed-SGD guarantees up to constant factors, achieving $O((\eta,\eta_0TR)^{-1})$ convergence to a variance/heterogeneity floor with a fixed inner step size. Our analysis reveals a step-ahead-controlled residual contraction $\rho_r$ that explains the observed acceleration in the early training phase. To balance SAEF's rapid warm-up with EF's long-term stability, we select $\alpha$ near its theory-predicted optimum. Experiments across diverse architectures and datasets show that SA-PEF consistently reaches target accuracy faster than EF.

Title: PatchFormer: A Patch-Based Time Series Foundation Model with Hierarchical Masked Reconstruction and Cross-Domain Transfer Learning for Zero-Shot Multi-Horizon Forecasting
Authors: Olaf Yunus Laitinen Imanov, Derya Umut Kulali, Taner Yilmaz
Abstract: Time series forecasting is a fundamental problem with applications in climate, energy, healthcare, and finance. Many existing approaches require domain-specific feature engineering and substantial labeled data for each task. We introduce PatchFormer, a patch-based time series foundation model that uses hierarchical masked reconstruction for self-supervised pretraining and lightweight adapters for efficient transfer. PatchFormer segments time series into patches and learns multiscale temporal representations with learnable aggregation across temporal scales. Pretraining uses masked patch reconstruction with dynamic masking and objectives that encourage both local accuracy and global consistency, followed by cross-domain knowledge distillation. Experiments on 24 benchmark datasets spanning weather, energy, traffic, finance, and healthcare demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot multi-horizon forecasting, reducing mean squared error by 27.3 percent relative to strong baselines while requiring 94 percent less task-specific training data. The model exhibits near log-linear scaling with more pretraining data up to 100 billion points and processes length-512 sequences 3.8x faster than full-sequence transformers.

Title: Supporting Lemmas for RISE-based Control Methods
Authors: Rushikesh Kamalapurkar, Joel A. Rosenfeld, Justin Klotz, Ryan J. Downey, Warren E. Dixon
Abstract: A class of continuous controllers termed Robust Integral of the Signum of the Error (RISE) have been published over the last decade as a means to yield asymptotic convergence of the tracking error for classes of nonlinear systems that are subject to exogenous disturbances and/or modeling uncertainties. The development of this class of controllers relies on a property related to the integral of the signum of an error signal. A proof for this property is not available in previous literature. The stability of some RISE controllers is analyzed using differential inclusions. Such results rely on the hypothesis that a set of points is Lebesgue negligible. This paper states and proves two lemmas related to the properties.

Title: Constrained and Regularized Quantitative Ultrasound Parameter Estimation using ADMM
Authors: Ali K. Z. Tehrani, Hassan Rivaz, Ivan M. Rosado-Mendez
Abstract: Regularized estimation of quantitative ultrasound (QUS) parameters, such as attenuation and backscatter coefficients, has gained research interest. Recently, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has been applied successfully to estimate these parameters, by utilizing L2 and L1 norms for attenuation and backscatter coefficient regularization, respectively. While this method improves upon previous approaches, it does not fully leverage the prior knowledge of minimum physically feasible parameter values, sometimes yielding values outside the realistic range. This work addresses this limitation by incorporating minimum QUS parameter values as constraints to enhance ADMM estimation. The proposed method is validated using experimental phantom data.

Title: Hybrid Rate-Splitting and Sparse Code Multiple Access (RS-SCMA): Design and Performance
Authors: Minerva Priyadarsini, Zilong Liu, Kuntal Deka, Sujit Kumar Sahoo, Sanjeev Sharma
Abstract: This paper proposes, for the first time, a hybrid multiple access framework that integrates the principles of rate-splitting (RS) and sparse code multiple access (SCMA) in an SISO downlink scenario. The proposed scheme, termed RS-SCMA, unifies the powerful interference management capability of rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) with the near-optimal multiuser detection of SCMA. A key feature of RS-SCMA is a tunable splitting factor $\alpha$, which governs the allocation between the generic $M$-ary modulated common messages and SCMA-encoded private messages. This enables dynamic control over the fundamental trade-off between system sum-rate, bit error rate (BER), and the overloading factor. We develop novel transmitter and receiver architectures based on soft successive interference cancellation (SIC), incorporating message passing algorithm (MPA) detection and soft-symbol reconstruction. Furthermore, a unified analytical expression for the achievable sum-rate is derived as a function of the splitting factor $\alpha$. The performance of the proposed RS-SCMA system is evaluated in terms of both BER and sum-rate. Simulation results confirm the superiority of RS-SCMA over conventional SCMA and multi-carrier RSMA, demonstrating its scalability and robustness even in the presence of channel estimation errors.

Title: X-LRM: X-ray Large Reconstruction Model for Extremely Sparse-View Computed Tomography Recovery in One Second
Authors: Guofeng Zhang, Ruyi Zha, Hao He, Yixun Liang, Alan Yuille, Hongdong Li, Yuanhao Cai
Abstract: Sparse-view 3D CT reconstruction aims to recover volumetric structures from a limited number of 2D X-ray projections. Existing feedforward methods are constrained by the scarcity of large-scale training datasets and the absence of direct and consistent 3D representations. In this paper, we propose an X-ray Large Reconstruction Model (X-LRM) for extremely sparse-view ($<$10 views) CT reconstruction. X-LRM consists of two key components: X-former and X-triplane. X-former can handle an arbitrary number of input views using an MLP-based image tokenizer and a Transformer-based encoder. The output tokens are then upsampled into our X-triplane representation, which models the 3D radiodensity as an implicit neural field. To support the training of X-LRM, we introduce Torso-16K, a large-scale dataset comprising over 16K volume-projection pairs of various torso organs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that X-LRM outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 1.5 dB and achieves 27$\times$ faster speed with better flexibility. Furthermore, the evaluation of lung segmentation tasks also suggests the practical value of our approach. Our code and dataset will be released at this https URL

Title: Learning-based Multiuser Beamforming for Holographic MIMO~Systems
Authors: Shiyong Chen, Shengqian Han
Abstract: Holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) is a potential technique for improving spectral efficiency (SE) while maintaining low hardware cost and power consumption. Although conventional alternating optimization (AO) methods are widely adopted for optimizing the digital and holographic beamformers, their high computational complexity hinders real-time deployment. Deep learning provides an alternative with low inference latency, where graph neural networks (GNNs) have attracted considerable attention due to their ability to exploit permutation equivariance (PE) properties. In HMIMO systems, the optimal beamforming policy exhibits PE properties across multiple dimensions, which can be leveraged by GNNs. However, designing a single GNN to exploit the PE properties in all dimensions results in large model sizes and substantial training complexity. To address this issue, we first transform the beamforming optimization problem to optimize an equivalent beamformer and the holographic beamformer. Then, we propose a novel network architecture consisting of a gradient-based graph neural network (GGNN) followed by two projection modules, which first learns the equivalent beamformer and holographic beamformer and subsequently recovers the digital beamformer from the equivalent beamformer. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher SE with reduced inference latency than the AO baseline and exhibits superior generalization performance compared with existing learning-based approaches.

Title: Simplicity is Key: An Unsupervised Pretraining Approach for Sparse Radio Channels
Authors: Jonathan Ott, Maximilian Stahlke, Tobias Feigl, Bjoern M. Eskofier, Christopher Mutschler
Abstract: Unsupervised representation learning for wireless channel state information (CSI)reduces reliance on labeled data, thereby lowering annotation costs, and often improves performance on downstream tasks. However, state-of-the-art approaches take little or no account of domain-specific knowledge, forcing the model to learn well-known concepts solely from data. We introduce Sparse pretrained Radio Transformer (SpaRTran), a hybrid method based on the concept of compressed sensing for wireless channels. In contrast to existing work, SpaRTran builds around a wireless channel model that constrains the optimization procedure to physically meaningful solutions and induces a strong inductive bias. Compared to the state of the art, SpaRTran cuts positioning error by up to 28% and increases top-1 codebook selection accuracy for beamforming by 26 percentage points. Our results show that capturing the sparse nature of radio propagation as an unsupervised learning objective improves performance for network optimization and radio-localization tasks.

Title: Confidence intervals for forced alignment boundaries using model ensembles
Authors: Matthew C. Kelley
Abstract: Forced alignment is a common tool to align audio with orthographic and phonetic transcriptions. Most forced alignment tools provide only a single estimate of a boundary. The present project introduces a method of deriving confidence intervals for these boundaries using a neural network ensemble technique. Ten different segment classifier neural networks were previously trained, and the alignment process is repeated with each model. The alignment ensemble is then used to place the boundary at the median of the boundaries in the ensemble, and 97.85% confidence intervals are constructed using order statistics. Having confidence intervals provides an estimate of the uncertainty in the boundary placement, facilitating tasks like finding boundaries that should be reviewed. As a bonus, on the Buckeye and TIMIT corpora, the ensemble boundaries show a slight overall improvement over using just a single model. The confidence intervals can be emitted during the alignment process as JSON files and a main table for programmatic and statistical analysis. For familiarity, they are also output as Praat TextGrids using a point tier to represent the intervals.

Title: BRISC: Annotated Dataset for Brain Tumor Segmentation and Classification
Authors: Amirreza Fateh, Yasin Rezvani, Sara Moayedi, Sadjad Rezvani, Fatemeh Fateh, Mansoor Fateh, Vahid Abolghasemi
Abstract: Accurate segmentation and classification of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remain key challenges in medical image analysis, primarily due to the lack of high-quality, balanced, and diverse datasets with expert annotations. In this work, we address this gap by introducing BRISC, a dataset designed for brain tumor segmentation and classification tasks, featuring high-resolution segmentation masks. The dataset comprises 6,000 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans, which were collated from multiple public datasets that lacked segmentation labels. Our primary contribution is the subsequent expert annotation of these images, performed by certified radiologists and physicians. It includes three major tumor types, namely glioma, meningioma, and pituitary, as well as non-tumorous cases. Each sample includes high-resolution labels and is categorized across axial, sagittal, and coronal imaging planes to facilitate robust model development and cross-view generalization. To demonstrate the utility of the dataset, we provide benchmark results for both tasks using standard deep learning models. The BRISC dataset is made publicly available. datasetlink: this https URL

Title: Full-Duplex-Bench v1.5: Evaluating Overlap Handling for Full-Duplex Speech Models
Authors: Guan-Ting Lin, Shih-Yun Shan Kuan, Qirui Wang, Jiachen Lian, Tingle Li, Shinji Watanabe, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: Full-duplex spoken dialogue systems promise to transform human-machine interaction from a rigid, turn-based protocol into a fluid, natural conversation. However, the central challenge to realizing this vision, managing overlapping speech, remains critically under-evaluated. We introduce Full-Duplex-Bench v1.5, the first fully automated benchmark designed to systematically probe how models behave during speech overlap. The benchmark simulates four representative overlap scenarios: user interruption, user backchannel, talking to others, and background speech. Our framework, compatible with open-source and commercial API-based models, provides a comprehensive suite of metrics analyzing categorical dialogue behaviors, stop and response latency, and prosodic adaptation. Benchmarking five state-of-the-art agents reveals two divergent strategies: a responsive approach prioritizing rapid response to user input, and a floor-holding approach that preserves conversational flow by filtering overlapping events. Our open-source framework enables practitioners to accelerate the development of robust full-duplex systems by providing the tools for reproducible evaluation

Title: Random forest-based out-of-distribution detection for robust lung cancer segmentation
Authors: Aneesh Rangnekar, Harini Veeraraghavan
Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of cancerous lesions from computed tomography (CT) scans is essential for automated treatment planning and cancer treatment response assessment. Transformer-based models with self-supervised pretraining can produce reliably accurate segmentation from in-distribution (ID) data but degrade when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. We address this challenge with RF-Deep, a random forest classifier that utilizes deep features from a pretrained transformer encoder of the segmentation model to detect OOD scans and enhance segmentation reliability. The segmentation model comprises a Swin Transformer encoder, pretrained with masked image modeling (SimMIM) on 10,432 unlabeled 3D CT scans covering cancerous and non-cancerous conditions, with a convolution decoder, trained to segment lung cancers in 317 3D scans. Independent testing was performed on 603 3D CT public datasets that included one ID dataset and four OOD datasets comprising chest CTs with pulmonary embolism (PE) and COVID-19, and abdominal CTs with kidney cancers and healthy volunteers. RF-Deep detected OOD cases with a FPR95 of 18.26%, 27.66%, and less than 0.1% on PE, COVID-19, and abdominal CTs, consistently outperforming established OOD approaches. The RF-Deep classifier provides a simple and effective approach to enhance reliability of cancer segmentation in ID and OOD scenarios.

Title: Attention-Enhanced Learning for Sensing-Assisted Long-Term Beam Tracking in mmWave Communications
Authors: Mengyuan Ma, Nhan Thanh Nguyen, Nir Shlezinger, Yonina C. Eldar, Markku Juntti
Abstract: Beam training and prediction in millimeter-wave communications are highly challenging due to fast time-varying channels and sensitivity to blockages and mobility. In this context, infrastructure-mounted cameras can capture rich environmental information that can facilitate beam tracking design. In this work, we develop an efficient attention-enhanced machine learning model for long-term beam tracking built upon convolutional neural networks and gated recurrent units to predict both current and future beams from past observed images. The integrated temporal attention mechanism substantially improves its predictive performance. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed design achieves Top-5 beam prediction accuracies exceeding 90% across both current and six future time slots, significantly reducing overhead arising from sensing and processing for beam training. It further attains 97% of state-of-the-art performance with only 3% of the computational complexity.

Title: Blind Source Separation of Radar Signals in Time Domain Using Deep Learning
Authors: Sven Hinderer
Abstract: Identification and further analysis of radar emitters in a contested environment requires detection and separation of incoming signals. If they arrive from the same direction and at similar frequencies, deinterleaving them remains challenging. A solution to overcome this limitation becomes increasingly important with the advancement of emitter capabilities. We propose treating the problem as blind source separation in time domain and apply supervisedly trained neural networks to extract the underlying signals from the received mixture. This allows us to handle highly overlapping and also continuous wave (CW) signals from both radar and communication emitters. We make use of advancements in the field of audio source separation and extend a current state-of-the-art model with the objective of deinterleaving arbitrary radio frequency (RF) signals. Results show, that our approach is capable of separating two unknown waveforms in a given frequency band with a single channel receiver.

Title: Query-Based Asymmetric Modeling with Decoupled Input-Output Rates for Speech Restoration
Authors: Ui-Hyeop Shin, Jaehyun Ko, Woocheol Jeong, Hyung-Min Park
Abstract: Speech restoration in real-world conditions is challenging due to compounded distortions and mismatches between input and desired output rates. Most existing systems assume a fixed and shared input-output rate, relying on external resampling that incurs redundant computation and limits generality. We address this setting by formulating speech restoration under decoupled input-output rates, and propose TF-Restormer, a query-based asymmetric modeling framework. The encoder concentrates analysis on the observed input bandwidth using a time-frequency dual-path architecture, while a lightweight decoder reconstructs missing spectral content via frequency extension queries. This design enables a single model to operate consistently across arbitrary input-output rate pairs without redundant resampling. Experiments across diverse sampling rates, degradations, and operating modes show that TF-Restormer maintains stable restoration behavior and balanced perceptual quality, including in real-time streaming scenarios.

Title: WaveSP-Net: Learnable Wavelet-Domain Sparse Prompt Tuning for Speech Deepfake Detection
Authors: Xi Xuan, Xuechen Liu, Wenxin Zhang, Yi-Cheng Lin, Xiaojian Lin, Tomi Kinnunen
Abstract: Modern front-end design for speech deepfake detection relies on full fine-tuning of large pre-trained models like XLSR. However, this approach is not parameter-efficient and may lead to suboptimal generalization to realistic, in-the-wild data types. To address these limitations, we introduce a new family of parameter-efficient front-ends that fuse prompt-tuning with classical signal processing transforms. These include FourierPT-XLSR, which uses the Fourier Transform, and two variants based on the Wavelet Transform: WSPT-XLSR and Partial-WSPT-XLSR. We further propose WaveSP-Net, a novel architecture combining a Partial-WSPT-XLSR front-end and a bidirectional Mamba-based back-end. This design injects multi-resolution features into the prompt embeddings, which enhances the localization of subtle synthetic artifacts without altering the frozen XLSR parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that WaveSP-Net outperforms several state-of-the-art models on two new and challenging benchmarks, Deepfake-Eval-2024 and SpoofCeleb, with low trainable parameters and notable performance gains.

Title: Adaptive Per-Channel Energy Normalization Front-end for Robust Audio Signal Processing
Authors: Hanyu Meng, Vidhyasaharan Sethu, Eliathamby Ambikairajah, Qiquan Zhang, Haizhou Li
Abstract: In audio signal processing, learnable front-ends have shown strong performance across diverse tasks by optimizing task-specific representation. However, their parameters remain fixed once trained, lacking flexibility during inference and limiting robustness under dynamic complex acoustic environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel adaptive paradigm for audio front-ends that replaces static parameterization with a closed-loop neural controller. Specifically, we simplify the learnable front-end LEAF architecture and integrate a neural controller for adaptive representation via dynamically tuning Per-Channel Energy Normalization. The neural controller leverages both the current and the buffered past subband energies to enable input-dependent adaptation during inference. Experimental results on multiple audio classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed adaptive front-end consistently outperforms prior fixed and learnable front-ends under both clean and complex acoustic conditions. These results highlight neural adaptability as a promising direction for the next generation of audio front-ends.

Title: Is Repeater-Assisted Massive MIMO Compatible with Dynamic TDD?
Authors: Martin Andersson, Anubhab Chowdhury, Erik G. Larsson
Abstract: We present a framework for joint amplification and phase shift optimization of the repeater gain in dynamic time-division duplex (TDD) repeater-assisted massive MIMO networks. Repeaters, being active scatterers with amplification and phase shift, enhance the received signal strengths for users. However, they inevitably also amplify undesired noise and interference signals, which become particularly prominent in dynamic TDD systems due to the concurrent downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) transmissions, introducing cross-link interference among access points and users operating in opposite transmit directions. This causes a non-trivial trade-off between amplification of desired and undesired signals. To underpin the conditions under which such a trade-off can improve performance, we first derive DL and UL spectral efficiencies (SEs), and then develop a repeater gain optimization algorithm for SE maximization. Numerically, we show that our proposed algorithm successfully calibrates the repeater gain to amplify the desired signal while limiting the interference.

Title: A Multi-Stage Deep Learning Framework with PKCP-MixUp Augmentation for Pediatric Liver Tumor Diagnosis Using Multi-Phase Contrast-Enhanced CT
Authors: Wanqi Wang, Chun Yang, Jianbo Shao, Yaokai Zhang, Xuehua Peng, Jin Sun, Chao Xiong, Long Lu, Lianting Hu
Abstract: Pediatric liver tumors are one of the most common solid tumors in pediatrics, with differentiation of benign or malignant status and pathological classification critical for clinical treatment. While pathological examination is the gold standard, the invasive biopsy has notable limitations: the highly vascular pediatric liver and fragile tumor tissue raise complication risks such as bleeding; additionally, young children with poor compliance require anesthesia for biopsy, increasing medical costs or psychological trauma. Although many efforts have been made to utilize AI in clinical settings, most researchers have overlooked its importance in pediatric liver tumors. To establish a non-invasive examination procedure, we developed a multi-stage deep learning (DL) framework for automated pediatric liver tumor diagnosis using multi-phase contrast-enhanced CT. Two retrospective and prospective cohorts were enrolled. We established a novel PKCP-MixUp data augmentation method to address data scarcity and class imbalance. We also trained a tumor detection model to extract ROIs, and then set a two-stage diagnosis pipeline with three backbones with ROI-masked images. Our tumor detection model has achieved high performance (mAP=0.871), and the first stage classification model between benign and malignant tumors reached an excellent performance (AUC=0.989). Final diagnosis models also exhibited robustness, including benign subtype classification (AUC=0.915) and malignant subtype classification (AUC=0.979). We also conducted multi-level comparative analyses, such as ablation studies on data and training pipelines, as well as Shapley-Value and CAM interpretability analyses. This framework fills the pediatric-specific DL diagnostic gap, provides actionable insights for CT phase selection and model design, and paves the way for precise, accessible pediatric liver tumor diagnosis.

Title: Feasibility-aware Learning of Robust Temporal Logic Controllers using BarrierNet
Authors: Wenliang Liu, Shuo Liu, Wei Xiao, Calin A. Belta
Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have been used to enforce safety and task specifications expressed in Signal Temporal Logic (STL). However, existing CBF-STL approaches typically rely on fixed hyperparameters and per-step optimization, which can lead to overly conservative behavior, infeasibility near tight input limits, and difficulty satisfying long-horizon STL tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a feasibility-aware learning framework that constructs trainable, time-varying High Order Control Barrier Function (HOCBF) constraints and hyperparameters that guarantee satisfaction of a given STL specification. We introduce a unified robustness measure that jointly captures STL satisfaction, constraint feasibility, and control-bound compliance, and propose a neural network architecture to generate control inputs that maximize this robustness. The resulting controller guarantees STL satisfaction with strictly feasible HOCBF constraints and requires no manual tuning. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework maintains high STL robustness under tight input bounds and significantly outperforms fixed-parameter and non-adaptive baselines in complex environments.

Title: Listen, Look, Drive: Coupling Audio Instructions for User-aware VLA-based Autonomous Driving
Authors: Ziang Guo, Feng Yang, Xuefeng Zhang, Jiaqi Guo, Kun Zhao, Yixiao Zhou, Peng Lu, Zufeng Zhang, Sifa Zheng
Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models promise an open-vocabulary interface that can translate perceptual ambiguity into semantically grounded driving decisions, yet they still treat language as a static prior fixed at inference time. As a result, the model must infer continuously shifting objectives from pixels alone, yielding delayed or overly conservative maneuvers. We argue that effective VLAs for autonomous driving need an online channel in which users can influence driving with specific intentions. To this end, we present EchoVLA, a user-aware VLA that couples camera streams with in situ audio instructions. We augment the nuScenes dataset with temporally aligned, intent-specific speech commands generated by converting ego-motion descriptions into synthetic audios. Further, we compose emotional speech-trajectory pairs into a multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for fine-tuning a Multimodal Large Model (MLM) based on Qwen2.5-Omni. Specifically, we synthesize the audio-augmented dataset with different emotion types paired with corresponding driving behaviors, leveraging the emotional cues embedded in tone, pitch, and speech tempo to reflect varying user states, such as urgent or hesitant intentions, thus enabling our EchoVLA to interpret not only the semantic content but also the emotional context of audio commands for more nuanced and emotionally adaptive driving behavior. In open-loop benchmarks, our approach reduces the average L2 error by $59.4\%$ and the collision rate by $74.4\%$ compared to the baseline of vision-only perception. More experiments on nuScenes dataset validate that EchoVLA not only steers the trajectory through audio instructions, but also modulates driving behavior in response to the emotions detected in the user's speech.

Title: RIS-Enabled Spoofing Against Adversary Sensing: CRB-Maximizing Design and Decoying Analysis
Authors: Ioannis Gavras, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, George C. Alexandropoulos
Abstract: This paper studies the capability of a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS), when transparently covering a User Equipment (UE), to deceive an adversary monostatic radar system. A compact RIS kernel model that explicitly links the radar's angular response to the RIS phase profile is introduced, enabling an analytical investigation of the Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation accuracy with respect to the kernel's power. This model is also leveraged to formulate an RIS-based spoofing design with the dual objective to enforce strict nulls around the UE's true reflection AoA and maximize the channel gain towards a decoy direction. The RIS's deception capability is quantified using point-wise and angle-range robust criteria, and a configuration-independent placement score guiding decoy selection is proposed. Selected numerical results confirm deep nulls at the true reflection AoA together with a pronounced decoy peak, rendering maximum-likelihood sensing at the adversary radar unreliable.

Title: GPT2MEG: Quantizing MEG for Autoregressive Generation
Authors: Richard Csaky, Mats W.J. van Es, Oiwi Parker Jones, Mark Woolrich
Abstract: Foundation models trained with self-supervised objectives are increasingly applied to brain recordings, but autoregressive generation of realistic multichannel neural time series remains comparatively underexplored, particularly for Magnetoencephalography (MEG). We study (i) modified multichannel WaveNet variants and (ii) a GPT-2-style Transformer, autoregressively trained by next-step prediction on unlabelled MEG. For the Transformer, we propose a simple quantization/tokenization and embedding scheme (channel, subject, and task-condition embeddings) that repurposes a language-model architecture for continuous, high-rate multichannel time series and enables conditional simulation of task-evoked activity. Across forecasting, long-horizon generation, and downstream decoding, GPT2MEG more faithfully reproduces temporal, spectral, and task-evoked statistics of real MEG than WaveNet variants and linear autoregressive baselines, and scales to multiple subjects via subject embeddings.

Title: Structural and Statistical Audio Texture Knowledge Distillation for Environmental Sound Classification
Authors: Jarin Ritu, Amirmohammad Mohammadi, Davelle Carreiro, Alexandra Van Dine, Joshua Peeples
Abstract: While knowledge distillation has shown success in various audio tasks, its application to environmental sound classification often overlooks essential low-level audio texture features needed to capture local patterns in complex acoustic environments. To address this gap, the Structural and Statistical Audio Texture Knowledge Distillation (SSATKD) framework is proposed, which combines high-level contextual information with low-level structural and statistical audio textures extracted from intermediate layers. To evaluate its generalizability to a broad range of applications, SSATKD is tested on four diverse datasets within the environmental sound classification domain, namely two passive sonar datasets: DeepShip and Vessel Type Underwater Acoustic Data (VTUAD) and two general environmental sound datasets: Environmental Sound Classification 50 (ESC-50) and UrbanSound8K. Two teacher adaptation strategies are explored: classifier-head-only adaptation and full fine-tuning. The framework is further evaluated using various convolutional and transformer-based teacher models. Experimental results demonstrate consistent accuracy improvements across all datasets and settings, confirming the effectiveness and robustness of SSATKD in real-world sound classification tasks.

Title: CTC-DRO: Robust Optimization for Reducing Language Disparities in Speech Recognition
Authors: Martijn Bartelds, Ananjan Nandi, Moussa Koulako Bala Doumbouya, Dan Jurafsky, Tatsunori Hashimoto, Karen Livescu
Abstract: Modern deep learning models often achieve high overall performance, but consistently fail on specific subgroups. Group distributionally robust optimization (group DRO) addresses this problem by minimizing the worst-group loss, but it fails when group losses misrepresent performance differences between groups. This is common in domains like speech, where the widely used connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss not only scales with input length but also varies with linguistic and acoustic properties, leading to spurious differences between group losses. We present CTC-DRO, which addresses the shortcomings of the group DRO objective by smoothing the group weight update to prevent overemphasis on consistently high-loss groups, while using input length-matched batching to mitigate CTC's scaling issues. We evaluate CTC-DRO on the task of multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) across five language sets from the diverse ML-SUPERB 2.0 benchmark. CTC-DRO consistently outperforms group DRO and CTC-based baseline models, reducing the worst-language error by up to 47.1% and the average error by up to 32.9%. CTC-DRO can be applied to ASR with minimal computational costs, and, while motivated by multilingual ASR, offers the potential for reducing group disparities in other domains with similar challenges.

Title: Smart Exploration in Reinforcement Learning using Bounded Uncertainty Models
Authors: J.S. van Hulst, W.P.M.H. Heemels, D.J. Antunes
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework for decision-making in uncertain environments, but it often requires large amounts of data to learn an optimal policy. We address this challenge by incorporating prior model knowledge to guide exploration and accelerate the learning process. Specifically, we assume access to a model set that contains the true transition kernel and reward function. We optimize over this model set to obtain upper and lower bounds on the Q-function, which are then used to guide the exploration of the agent. We provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of the Q-function to the optimal Q-function under the proposed class of exploring policies. Furthermore, we also introduce a data-driven regularized version of the model set optimization problem that ensures the convergence of the class of exploring policies to the optimal policy. Lastly, we show that when the model set has a specific structure, namely the bounded-parameter MDP (BMDP) framework, the regularized model set optimization problem becomes convex and simple to implement. In this setting, we also prove finite-time convergence to the optimal policy under mild assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed exploration strategy, which we call BUMEX (Bounded Uncertainty Model-based Exploration), in a simulation study. The results indicate that the proposed method can significantly accelerate learning in benchmark examples. A toolbox is available at this https URL.

Authors: Yunting Xu, Jiacheng Wang, Ruichen Zhang, Changyuan Zhao, Dusit Niyato, Jiawen Kang, Zehui Xiong, Bo Qian, Haibo Zhou, Shiwen Mao, Abbas Jamalipour, Xuemin Shen, Dong In Kim
Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising paradigm for scaling model capacity while preserving computational efficiency, particularly in large-scale machine learning architectures such as large language models (LLMs). Recent advances in MoE have facilitated its adoption in wireless networks to address the increasing complexity and heterogeneity of modern communication systems. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the MoE framework in wireless networks, highlighting its potential in optimizing resource efficiency, improving scalability, and enhancing adaptability across diverse network tasks. We first introduce the fundamental concepts of MoE, including various gating mechanisms and the integration with generative AI (GenAI) and reinforcement learning (RL). Subsequently, we discuss the extensive applications of MoE across critical wireless communication scenarios, such as vehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), satellite communications, heterogeneous networks, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), and mobile edge networks. Furthermore, key applications in channel prediction, physical layer signal processing, radio resource management, network optimization, and security are thoroughly examined. Additionally, we present a detailed overview of open-source datasets that are widely used in MoE-based models to support diverse machine learning tasks. Finally, this survey identifies crucial future research directions for MoE, emphasizing the importance of advanced training techniques, resource-aware gating strategies, and deeper integration with emerging 6G technologies.

Title: JAFAR: Jack up Any Feature at Any Resolution
Authors: Paul Couairon, Loick Chambon, Louis Serrano, Jean-Emmanuel Haugeard, Matthieu Cord, Nicolas Thome
Abstract: Foundation Vision Encoders have become essential for a wide range of dense vision tasks. However, their low-resolution spatial feature outputs necessitate feature upsampling to produce the high-resolution modalities required for downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce JAFAR, a lightweight and flexible feature upsampler that enhances the spatial resolution of visual features from any Foundation Vision Encoder to an arbitrary target resolution. JAFAR employs an attention-based module designed to promote semantic alignment between high-resolution queries, derived from low-level image features, and semantically enriched low-resolution keys, using Spatial Feature Transform (SFT) modulation. Notably, despite the absence of high-resolution supervision, we demonstrate that learning at low upsampling ratios and resolutions generalizes remarkably well to significantly higher output scales.

Title: Neural Cellular Automata: From Cells to Pixels
Authors: Ehsan Pajouheshgar, Yitao Xu, Ali Abbasi, Alexander Mordvintsev, Wenzel Jakob, Sabine Süsstrunk
Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) are bio-inspired dynamical systems in which identical cells iteratively apply a learned local update rule to self-organize into complex patterns, exhibiting regeneration, robustness, and spontaneous dynamics. Despite their success in texture synthesis and morphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined to low-resolution outputs. This limitation stems from (1) training time and memory requirements that grow quadratically with grid size, (2) the strictly local propagation of information that impedes long-range cell communication, and (3) the heavy compute demands of real-time inference at high resolution. In this work, we overcome this limitation by pairing an NCA that evolves on a coarse grid with a lightweight implicit decoder that maps cell states and local coordinates to appearance attributes, enabling the same model to render outputs at arbitrary resolution. Moreover, because both the decoder and NCA updates are local, inference remains highly parallelizable. To supervise high-resolution outputs efficiently, we introduce task-specific losses for morphogenesis (growth from a seed) and texture synthesis with minimal additional memory and computation overhead. Our experiments across 2D/3D grids and mesh domains demonstrate that our hybrid models produce high-resolution outputs in real-time, and preserve the characteristic self-organizing behavior of NCAs.

Title: AGFS-Tractometry: A Novel Atlas-Guided Fine-Scale Tractometry Approach for Enhanced Along-Tract Group Statistical Comparison Using Diffusion MRI Tractography
Authors: Ruixi Zheng, Wei Zhang, Yijie Li, Xi Zhu, Zhou Lan, Jarrett Rushmore, Yogesh Rathi, Nikos Makris, Lauren J. O'Donnell, Fan Zhang
Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography is currently the only method for in vivo mapping of the brain's white matter (WM) connections. Tractometry is an advanced tractography analysis technique for along-tract profiling to investigate the morphology and microstructural properties along the fiber tracts. Tractometry has become an essential tool for studying local along-tract differences between different populations (e.g., health vs disease). In this study, we propose a novel atlas-guided fine-scale tractometry method, namely AGFS-Tractometry, that leverages tract spatial information and permutation testing to enhance the along-tract statistical analysis between populations. There are two major contributions in AGFS-Tractometry. First, we create a novel atlas-guided tract profiling template that enables consistent, fine-scale, along-tract parcellation of subject-specific fiber tracts. Second, we propose a novel nonparametric permutation testing group comparison method to enable simultaneous analysis across all along-tract parcels while correcting for multiple comparisons. We perform experimental evaluations on synthetic datasets with known group differences and in vivo real data. We compare AGFS-Tractometry with two state-of-the-art tractometry methods, including Automated Fiber-tract Quantification (AFQ) and BUndle ANalytics (BUAN). Our results show that the proposed AGFS-Tractometry obtains enhanced sensitivity and specificity in detecting local WM differences. In the real data analysis experiments, AGFS-Tractometry can identify more regions with significant differences, which are anatomically consistent with the existing literature. Overall, these demonstrate the ability of AGFS-Tractometry to detect subtle or spatially localized WM group-level differences.

Title: AEDR: Training-Free AI-Generated Image Attribution via Autoencoder Double-Reconstruction
Authors: Chao Wang, Zijin Yang, Yaofei Wang, Weiming Zhang, Kejiang Chen
Abstract: The rapid advancement of image-generation technologies has made it possible for anyone to create photorealistic images using generative models, raising significant security concerns. To mitigate malicious use, tracing the origin of such images is essential. Reconstruction-based attribution methods offer a promising solution, but they often suffer from reduced accuracy and high computational costs when applied to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. To address these challenges, we propose AEDR (AutoEncoder Double-Reconstruction), a novel training-free attribution method designed for generative models with continuous autoencoders. Unlike existing reconstruction-based approaches that rely on the value of a single reconstruction loss, AEDR performs two consecutive reconstructions using the model's autoencoder, and adopts the ratio of these two reconstruction losses as the attribution signal. This signal is further calibrated using the image homogeneity metric to improve accuracy, which inherently cancels out absolute biases caused by image complexity, with autoencoder-based reconstruction ensuring superior computational efficiency. Experiments on eight top latent diffusion models show that AEDR achieves 25.5% higher attribution accuracy than existing reconstruction-based methods, while requiring only 1% of the computational time.

Title: Indoor Positioning Based on Active Radar Sensing and Passive Reflectors: Reflector Placement Optimization
Authors: Sven Hinderer, Pascal Schlachter, Zhibin Yu, Xiaofeng Wu, Bin Yang
Abstract: We extend our work on a novel indoor positioning system (IPS) for autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) based on radar sensing of local, passive radar reflectors. Through the combination of simple reflectors and a single-channel frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar, high positioning accuracy at low system cost can be achieved. Further, a multi-objective (MO) particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is presented that optimizes the 2D placement of radar reflectors in complex room settings.

Title: WaveletGaussian: Wavelet-domain Diffusion for Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Object Reconstruction
Authors: Hung Nguyen, Runfa Li, An Le, Truong Nguyen
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a powerful representation for image-based object reconstruction, yet its performance drops sharply in sparse-view settings. Prior works address this limitation by employing diffusion models to repair corrupted renders, subsequently using them as pseudo ground truths for later optimization. While effective, such approaches incur heavy computation from the diffusion fine-tuning and repair steps. We present WaveletGaussian, a framework for more efficient sparse-view 3D Gaussian object reconstruction. Our key idea is to shift diffusion into the wavelet domain: diffusion is applied only to the low-resolution LL subband, while high-frequency subbands are refined with a lightweight network. We further propose an efficient online random masking strategy to curate training pairs for diffusion fine-tuning, replacing the commonly used, but inefficient, leave-one-out strategy. Experiments across two benchmark datasets, Mip-NeRF 360 and OmniObject3D, show WaveletGaussian achieves competitive rendering quality while substantially reducing training time.

Title: Zeroth-Order Constrained Optimization from a Control Perspective via Feedback Linearization
Authors: Runyu Zhang, Gioele Zardini, Asuman Ozdaglar, Jeff Shamma, Na Li
Abstract: Safe derivative-free optimization under unknown constraints is a fundamental challenge in modern learning and control. Existing zeroth-order (ZO) methods typically still assume access to a first-order oracle of the constraint functions or restrict attention to convex settings, leaving nonconvex optimization with black-box constraints largely unexplored. We propose the zeroth-order feedback-linearization (ZOFL) algorithm for ZO constrained optimization that enforces feasibility without access to the first-order oracle of the constraint functions and applies to both equality and inequality constraints. The proposed approach relies only on noisy, sample-based gradient estimates obtained via two-point estimators, yet provably guarantees constraint satisfaction under mild regularity conditions. It adopts a control-theoretic perspective on ZO constrained optimization and leverages feedback linearization, a nonlinear control technique, to enforce feasibility. Finite-time bounds on constraint violation and asymptotic global convergence guarantees are established for the ZOFL algorithm. A midpoint discretization variant is further developed to improve feasibility without sacrificing optimality. Empirical results demonstrate that ZOFL consistently outperforms standard ZO baselines, achieving competitive objective values while maintaining feasibility.

Title: Higher-Order Feature Attribution: Bridging Statistics, Explainable AI, and Topological Signal Processing
Authors: Kurt Butler, Guanchao Feng, Petar Djuric
Abstract: Feature attributions are post-training analysis methods that assess how various input features of a machine learning model contribute to an output prediction. Their interpretation is straightforward when features act independently, but it becomes less clear when the predictive model involves interactions, such as multiplicative relationships or joint feature contributions. In this work, we propose a general theory of higher-order feature attribution, which we develop on the foundation of Integrated Gradients (IG). This work extends existing frameworks in the literature on explainable AI. When using IG as the method of feature attribution, we discover natural connections to statistics and topological signal processing. We provide several theoretical results that establish the theory, and we validate our theory on a few examples.

Title: Targeted Pooled Latent-Space Steganalysis Applied to Generative Steganography, with a Fix
Authors: Etienne Levecque (LIST3N), Aurélien Noirault (CRIStAL), Tomáš Pevn{ý} (CTU), Jan Butora (CRIStAL), Patrick Bas (CRIStAL), Rémi Cogranne (LIST3N)
Abstract: Steganographic schemes dedicated to generated images modify the seed vector in the latent space to embed a message. Whereas most steganalysis methods attempt to detect the embedding in the image space, this paper proposes to perform steganalysis in the latent space by modeling the statistical distribution of the norm of the latent vector. Specifically, we analyze the practical security of a scheme proposed by Hu et al. for latent diffusion models, which is both robust and practically undetectable when steganalysis is performed on generated images. We show that after embedding, the Stego (latent) vector is distributed on a hypersphere while the Cover vector is i.i.d. Gaussian. By going from the image space to the latent space, we show that it is possible to model the norm of the vector in the latent space under the Cover or Stego hypothesis as Gaussian distributions with different variances. A Likelihood Ratio Test is then derived to perform pooled steganalysis. The impact of the potential knowledge of the prompt and the number of diffusion steps is also studied. Additionally, we show how, by randomly sampling the norm of the latent vector before generation, the initial Stego scheme becomes undetectable in the latent space.

Title: Quantification of dual-state 5-ALA-induced PpIX fluorescence: Methodology and validation in tissue-mimicking phantoms
Authors: Silvère Ségaud, Charlie Budd, Matthew Elliot, Graeme Stasiuk, Jonathan Shapey, Yijing Xie, Tom Vercauteren
Abstract: Quantification of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence in human brain tumours has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes in neuro-oncology, but represents a formidable imaging challenge. Protoporphyrin is a biological molecule which interacts with the tissue micro-environment to form two photochemical states in glioma. Each exhibits markedly different quantum efficiencies, with distinct but overlapping emission spectra that also overlap with tissue autofluorescence. Fluorescence emission is known to be distorted by the intrinsic optical properties of tissue, coupled with marked intra-tumoural heterogeneity as a hallmark of glioma tumours. Existing quantitative fluorescence systems are developed and validated using simplified phantoms that do not simultaneously mimic the complex interactions between fluorophores and tissue optical properties or micro-environment. Consequently, existing systems risk introducing systematic errors into PpIX quantification when used in tissue. In this work, we introduce a novel pipeline for quantification of PpIX in glioma, which robustly differentiates both emission states from background autofluorescence without reliance on a priori spectral information, and accounts for variations in their quantum efficiency. Unmixed PpIX emission forms are then corrected for wavelength-dependent optical distortions and weighted for accurate quantification. Significantly, this pipeline is developed and validated using novel tissue-mimicking phantoms replicating the optical properties of glioma tissues and photochemical variability of PpIX fluorescence in glioma. Our workflow achieves strong correlation with ground-truth PpIX concentrations (R2 = 0.918+-0.002), demonstrating its potential for robust, quantitative PpIX fluorescence imaging in clinical settings.

Title: Learning Linearity in Audio Consistency Autoencoders via Implicit Regularization
Authors: Bernardo Torres, Manuel Moussallam, Gabriel Meseguer-Brocal
Abstract: Audio autoencoders learn useful, compressed audio representations, but their non-linear latent spaces prevent intuitive algebraic manipulation such as mixing or scaling. We introduce a simple training methodology to induce linearity in a high-compression Consistency Autoencoder (CAE) by using data augmentation, thereby inducing homogeneity (equivariance to scalar gain) and additivity (the decoder preserves addition) without altering the model's architecture or loss function. When trained with our method, the CAE exhibits linear behavior in both the encoder and decoder while preserving reconstruction fidelity. We test the practical utility of our learned space on music source composition and separation via simple latent arithmetic. This work presents a straightforward technique for constructing structured latent spaces, enabling more intuitive and efficient audio processing.

Title: Multi-hop Parallel Image Semantic Communication for Distortion Accumulation Mitigation
Authors: Bingyan Xie, Jihong Park, Yongpeng Wu, Wenjun Zhang, Tony Quek
Abstract: Existing semantic communication schemes primarily focus on single-hop scenarios, overlooking the challenges of multi-hop wireless image transmission. As semantic communication is inherently lossy, distortion accumulates over multiple hops, leading to significant performance degradation. To address this, we propose the multi-hop parallel image semantic communication (MHPSC) framework, which introduces a parallel residual compensation link at each hop against distortion accumulation. To minimize the associated transmission bandwidth overhead, a coarse-to-fine residual compression scheme is designed. A deep learning-based residual compressor first condenses the residuals, followed by the adaptive arithmetic coding (AAC) for further compression. A residual distribution estimation module predicts the prior distribution for the AAC to achieve fine compression performances. This approach ensures robust multi-hop image transmission with only a minor increase in transmission bandwidth. Experimental results confirm that MHPSC outperforms both existing semantic communication and traditional separated coding schemes.

Title: An Energy-Efficient RFET-Based Stochastic Computing Neural Network Accelerator
Authors: Sheng Lu, Qianhou Qu, Sungyong Jung, Qilian Liang, Chenyun Pan
Abstract: Stochastic computing (SC) offers significant reductions in hardware complexity for traditional convolutional neural networks(CNNs). However, despite its advantages, stochastic computing neural networks (SCNNs) often suffer from high resource consumption due to components such as stochastic number generators (SNGs) and accumulative parallel counters (APCs), which limit overall performance. This paper proposes a novel SCNN architecture leveraging reconfigurable field-effect transistors (RFETs). The inherent reconfigurability at the device level enables the design of highly efficient and compact SNGs, APCs, and other related essential components. Furthermore, a dedicated SCNN accelerator architecture is developed to facilitate system-level simulation. Based on accessible open-source standard cell libraries, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RFET-based SCNN accelerator achieves significant reductions in area, latency, and energy consumption compared to its FinFET-based counterpart at the same technology node.

Title: Diffusion Timbre Transfer Via Mutual Information Guided Inpainting
Authors: Ching Ho Lee, Javier Nistal, Stefan Lattner, Marco Pasini, George Fazekas
Abstract: We study timbre transfer as an inference-time editing problem for music audio. Starting from a strong pre-trained latent diffusion model, we introduce a lightweight procedure that requires no additional training: (i) a dimension-wise noise injection that targets latent channels most informative of instrument identity, and (ii) an early-step clamping mechanism that re-imposes the input's melodic and rhythmic structure during reverse diffusion. The method operates directly on audio latents and is compatible with text/audio conditioning (e.g., CLAP). We discuss design choices,analyze trade-offs between timbral change and structural preservation, and show that simple inference-time controls can meaningfully steer pre-trained models for style-transfer use cases.

Title: Spatiotemporal Semantic V2X Framework for Cooperative Collision Prediction
Authors: Murat Arda Onsu, Poonam Lohan, Burak Kantarci, Aisha Syed, Matthew Andrews, Sean Kennedy
Abstract: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) demand real-time collision prediction to ensure road safety and reduce accident severity. Conventional approaches rely on transmitting raw video or high-dimensional sensory data from roadside units (RSUs) to vehicles, which is impractical under vehicular communication bandwidth and latency constraints. In this work, we propose a semantic V2X framework in which RSU-mounted cameras generate spatiotemporal semantic embeddings of future frames using the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA). To evaluate the system, we construct a digital twin of an urban traffic environment enabling the generation of d verse traffic scenarios with both safe and collision events. These embeddings of the future frame, extracted from V-JEPA, capture task-relevant traffic dynamics and are transmitted via V2X links to vehicles, where a lightweight attentive probe and classifier decode them to predict imminent collisions. By transmitting only semantic embeddings instead of raw frames, the proposed system significantly reduces communication overhead while maintaining predictive accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework with an appropriate processing method achieves a 10% F1-score improvement for collision prediction while reducing transmission requirements by four orders of magnitude compared to raw video. This validates the potential of semantic V2X communication to enable cooperative, real-time collision prediction in ITS.

Title: EuleroDec: A Complex-Valued RVQ-VAE for Efficient and Robust Audio Coding
Authors: Luca Cerovaz, Michele Mancusi, Emanuele Rodolà
Abstract: Audio codecs power discrete music generative modelling, music streaming and immersive media by shrinking PCM audio to bandwidth-friendly bit-rates. Recent works have gravitated towards processing in the spectral domain; however, spectrogram-domains typically struggle with phase modeling which is naturally complex-valued. Most frequency-domain neural codecs either disregard phase information or encode it as two separate real-valued channels, limiting spatial fidelity. This entails the need to introduce adversarial discriminators at the expense of convergence speed and training stability to compensate for the inadequate representation power of the audio signal. In this work we introduce an end-to-end complex-valued RVQ-VAE audio codec that preserves magnitude-phase coupling across the entire analysis-quantization-synthesis pipeline and removes adversarial discriminators and diffusion post-filters. Without GANs or diffusion we match or surpass much longer-trained baselines in-domain and reach SOTA out-of-domain performance. Compared to standard baselines that train for hundreds of thousands of steps, our model reducing training budget by an order of magnitude is markedly more compute-efficient while preserving high perceptual quality.
