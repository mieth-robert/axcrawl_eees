Title: Articulation-Informed ASR: Integrating Articulatory Features into ASR via Auxiliary Speech Inversion and Cross-Attention Fusion
Authors: Ahmed Adel Attia, Jing Liu, Carol Espy Wilson
Abstract: Prior works have investigated the use of articulatory features as complementary representations for automatic speech recognition (ASR), but their use was largely confined to shallow acoustic models. In this work, we revisit articulatory information in the era of deep learning and propose a framework that leverages articulatory representations both as an auxiliary task and as a pseudo-input to the recognition model. Specifically, we employ speech inversion as an auxiliary prediction task, and the predicted articulatory features are injected into the model as a query stream in a cross-attention module with acoustic embeddings as keys and values. Experiments on LibriSpeech demonstrate that our approach yields consistent improvements over strong transformer-based baselines, particularly under low-resource conditions. These findings suggest that articulatory features, once sidelined in ASR research, can provide meaningful benefits when reintroduced with modern architectures.

Title: Dynamic Stress Detection: A Study of Temporal Progression Modelling of Stress in Speech
Authors: Vishakha Lall, Yisi Liu
Abstract: Detecting psychological stress from speech is critical in high-pressure settings. While prior work has leveraged acoustic features for stress detection, most treat stress as a static label. In this work, we model stress as a temporally evolving phenomenon influenced by historical emotional state. We propose a dynamic labelling strategy that derives fine-grained stress annotations from emotional labels and introduce cross-attention-based sequential models, a Unidirectional LSTM and a Transformer Encoder, to capture temporal stress progression. Our approach achieves notable accuracy gains on MuSE (+5%) and StressID (+18%) over existing baselines, and generalises well to a custom real-world dataset. These results highlight the value of modelling stress as a dynamic construct in speech.

Title: BaldWhisper: Faster Whisper with Head Shearing and Layer Merging
Authors: Yaya Sy, Christophe Cerisara, Irina Illina
Abstract: Pruning large pre-trained transformers for low-resource languages is challenging, as it often requires massive retraining data to recover performance. For instance, Distill-Whisper prunes Whisper by 40% and retrains on 21,000 hours of speech, far beyond what is available for most languages. Can Whisper be made lighter and faster for edge devices in data-scarce settings? Focusing on Bambara with only 32h of speech-to-text data, we propose a new pruning recipe. Instead of vocabulary pruning, which is unsuitable due to frequent code-switching by Bambara speakers, we compress the embeddings with low-rank decomposition and feature distillation. Rather than removing layers, we merge them to limit performance loss. The final model preserves 90% of the original performance while being 48% smaller and 2.15x faster on a MacBook Air M1.

Title: Look before Transcription: End-to-End SlideASR with Visually-Anchored Policy Optimization
Authors: Rui Hu, Delai Qiu, Yining Wang, Shengping Liu, Jitao Sang
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems often struggle with domain-specific terminology, especially in specialized settings such as academic lectures. To address this, we define the SlideASR task, which leverages the rich visual information from presentation slides to improve transcription accuracy. Existing pipeline methods for this task tend to be complex and underperform. Although omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) provide a promising end-to-end framework, they frequently fail in practice by degenerating into simple optical character recognition (OCR) systems. To overcome this, we propose Visually-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a novel post-training method designed to control the model's reasoning process. Drawing on the Chain-of-Thought reasoning paradigm, VAPO enforces a structured "Look before Transcription" procedure using a <think><answer> format. Specifically, the model first performs OCR on the slide content within the think step, then generates the transcription by referencing this recognized visual information in the answer step. This reasoning process is optimized via reinforcement learning with four distinct rewards targeting format compliance, OCR accuracy, ASR quality, and visual anchoring consistency. To support further research, we construct SlideASR-Bench, a new entity-rich benchmark consisting of a synthetic dataset for training and testing, and a challenging real-world set for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VAPO significantly improves recognition of domain-specific terms, establishing an effective end-to-end paradigm for SlideASR.

Title: Interlaced dynamic XCT reconstruction with spatio-temporal implicit neural representations
Authors: Mathias Boulanger, Ericmoore Jossou
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the use of spatio-temporalImplicit Neural Representations (INRs) for dynamic X-ray computed tomography (XCT) reconstruction under interlaced acquisition schemes. The proposed approach combines ADMM-based optimization with INCODE, a conditioning framework incorporating prior knowledge, to enable efficient convergence. We evaluate our method under diverse acquisition scenarios, varying the severity of global undersampling, spatial complexity (quantified via spatial information), and noise levels. Across all settings, our model achieves strong performance and outperforms Time-Interlaced Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (TIMBIR), a state-of-the-art model-based iterative method. In particular, we show that the inductive bias of the INR provides good robustness to moderate noise levels, and that introducing explicit noise modeling through a weighted least squares data fidelity term significantly improves performance in more challenging regimes. The final part of this work explores extensions toward a practical reconstruction framework. We demonstrate the modularity of our approach by explicitly modeling detector non-idealities, incorporating ring artifact correction directly within the reconstruction process. Additionally, we present a proof-of-concept 4D volumetric reconstruction by jointly optimizing over batched axial slices, an approach which opens up the possibilities for massive parallelization, a critical feature for processing large-scale datasets.

Title: UAV-Assisted 3-D Localization for IoT Networks Using a Simple and Efficient TDOA-AOA Estimator
Authors: Mojtaba Amiri, Rouhollah Amiri
Abstract: This letter proposes an algebraic solution for the problem of 3-D source localization utilizing the minimum number of measurements, i.e., one Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) and one Angle of Arrival (AOA) pair. The proposed method employs a closed-form weighted least squares estimator and enables the positioning using a single ground station and a cooperative UAV relaying the signal. Analytical derivations and simulation results demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving near-optimal performance aligned with the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) under moderate Gaussian noise conditions.

Title: Joint Detection, Channel Estimation and Interference Nulling for Terrestrial-Satellite Downlink Co-Existence in the Upper Mid-Band
Authors: Shizhen Jia, Mingjun Ying, Marco Mezzavilla, Doru Calin, Theodore S. Rappaport, Sundeep Rangan
Abstract: The upper mid-band FR3 spectrum (7-24 GHz) has garnered significant interest for future cellular services. However, utilizing a large portion of this band requires careful interference coordination with incumbent satellite systems. This paper investigates interference from high-power terrestrial base stations (TN-BSs) to satellite downlink receivers. A central challenge is that the victim receivers, i.e., ground-based non-terrestrial user equipment (NTN-UEs) such as satellite customer premises equipment, must first be detected and their channels estimated before the TN-BS can effectively place nulls in their directions. We explore a potential solution where NTN-UEs periodically transmit preambles or beacon signals that TN-BSs can use for detection and channel estimation. The performance of this nulling approach is analyzed in a simplified scenario with a single victim, revealing the interplay between path loss and estimation quality in determining nulling performance. To further validate the method, we conduct a detailed multi-user site-specific ray-tracing (RT) simulation in a rural environment. The results show that the proposed nulling approach is effective under realistic parameters, even with high densities of victim units, although TN-BS may require a substantial number of antennas.

Title: Cognitive Radio for Asymmetric Cellular Downlink with Multi-User MIMO
Authors: Omer Gokalp Serbetci, Lei Chu, Andreas F. Molisch
Abstract: Cognitive radio (CR) is an important technique for improving spectral efficiency, letting a secondary system operate in a wireless spectrum when the primary system does not make use of it. While it has been widely explored over the past 25 years, many common assumptions are not aligned with the realities of 5G networks. In this paper, we consider the CR problem for the following setup: (i) infrastructure-based systems, where downlink transmissions might occur to receivers whose positions are not, or not exactly, known; (ii) multi-beam antennas at both primary and secondary base stations. We formulate a detailed protocol to determine when secondary transmissions into different beam directions can interfere with primary users at potential locations and create probability-based interference rules. We then analyze the "catastrophic interference" probability and the "missed transmission opportunity" probability, as well as the achievable throughput, as a function of the transmit powers of the primary and secondary base stations and the sensing window of the secondary base station. Results can serve to more realistically assess the spectral efficiency gains in 5G infrastructure-based cognitive systems.

Title: Progressive Uncertainty-Guided Evidential U-KAN for Trustworthy Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Zhen Yang, Yansong Ma, Lei Chen
Abstract: Trustworthy medical image segmentation aims at deliver accurate and reliable results for clinical decision-making. Most existing methods adopt the evidence deep learning (EDL) paradigm due to its computational efficiency and theoretical robustness. However, the EDL-based methods often neglect leveraging uncertainty maps rich in attention cues to refine ambiguous boundary segmentation. To address this, we propose a progressive evidence uncertainty guided attention (PEUA) mechanism to guide the model to focus on the feature representation learning of hard regions. Unlike conventional approaches, PEUA progressively refines attention using uncertainty maps while employing low-rank learning to denoise attention weights, enhancing feature learning for challenging regions. Concurrently, standard EDL methods suppress evidence of incorrect class indiscriminately via Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization, impairing the uncertainty assessment in ambiguous areas and consequently distorts the corresponding attention guidance. We thus introduce a semantic-preserving evidence learning (SAEL) strategy, integrating a semantic-smooth evidence generator and a fidelity-enhancing regularization term to retain critical semantics. Finally, by embedding PEUA and SAEL with the state-of-the-art U-KAN, we proposes Evidential U-KAN, a novel solution for trustworthy medical image segmentation. Extensive experiments on 4 datasets demonstrate superior accuracy and reliability over the competing methods. The code is available at \href{this https URL}{github}.

Title: FS-RWKV: Leveraging Frequency Spatial-Aware RWKV for 3T-to-7T MRI Translation
Authors: Yingtie Lei, Zimeng Li, Chi-Man Pun, Yupeng Liu, Xuhang Chen
Abstract: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers enhanced spatial resolution and tissue contrast that enables the detection of subtle pathological changes in neurological disorders. However, the limited availability of 7T scanners restricts widespread clinical adoption due to substantial infrastructure costs and technical demands. Computational approaches for synthesizing 7T-quality images from accessible 3T acquisitions present a viable solution to this accessibility challenge. Existing CNN approaches suffer from limited spatial coverage, while Transformer models demand excessive computational overhead. RWKV architectures offer an efficient alternative for global feature modeling in medical image synthesis, combining linear computational complexity with strong long-range dependency capture. Building on this foundation, we propose Frequency Spatial-RWKV (FS-RWKV), an RWKV-based framework for 3T-to-7T MRI translation. To better address the challenges of anatomical detail preservation and global tissue contrast recovery, FS-RWKV incorporates two key modules: (1) Frequency-Spatial Omnidirectional Shift (FSO-Shift), which performs discrete wavelet decomposition followed by omnidirectional spatial shifting on the low-frequency branch to enhance global contextual representation while preserving high-frequency anatomical details; and (2) Structural Fidelity Enhancement Block (SFEB), a module that adaptively reinforces anatomical structure through frequency-aware feature fusion. Comprehensive experiments on UNC and BNU datasets demonstrate that FS-RWKV consistently outperforms existing CNN-, Transformer-, GAN-, and RWKV-based baselines across both T1w and T2w modalities, achieving superior anatomical fidelity and perceptual quality.

Title: SAM2-3dMed: Empowering SAM2 for 3D Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Yeqing Yang, Le Xu, Lixia Tian
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of 3D medical images is critical for clinical applications like disease assessment and treatment planning. While the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has shown remarkable success in video object segmentation by leveraging temporal cues, its direct application to 3D medical images faces two fundamental domain gaps: 1) the bidirectional anatomical continuity between slices contrasts sharply with the unidirectional temporal flow in videos, and 2) precise boundary delineation, crucial for morphological analysis, is often underexplored in video tasks. To bridge these gaps, we propose SAM2-3dMed, an adaptation of SAM2 for 3D medical imaging. Our framework introduces two key innovations: 1) a Slice Relative Position Prediction (SRPP) module explicitly models bidirectional inter-slice dependencies by guiding SAM2 to predict the relative positions of different slices in a self-supervised manner; 2) a Boundary Detection (BD) module enhances segmentation accuracy along critical organ and tissue boundaries. Extensive experiments on three diverse medical datasets (the Lung, Spleen, and Pancreas in the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset) demonstrate that SAM2-3dMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in segmentation overlap and boundary precision. Our approach not only advances 3D medical image segmentation performance but also offers a general paradigm for adapting video-centric foundation models to spatial volumetric data.

Title: Traffic-Aware Eco-Driving Control in CAVs via Learning-based Terminal Cost Model
Authors: Mehmet Fatih Ozkan, Dennis Kibalama, Jacob Paugh, Marcello Canova, Stephanie Stockar
Abstract: Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) offer significant potential for improving energy efficiency and lowering vehicle emissions through eco-driving technologies. Control algorithms in CAVs leverage look-ahead route information and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to optimize vehicle performance. However, existing eco-driving strategies often neglect macroscopic traffic effects, such as upstream traffic jams, that occur outside the optimization horizon but significantly impact vehicle energy efficiency. This work presents a novel Neural Network (NN)-based methodology to approximate the terminal cost within a model predictive control (MPC) problem framework, explicitly incorporating upstream traffic dynamics. By incorporating traffic jams into the optimization process, the proposed traffic-aware approach yields more energy-efficient speed trajectories compared to traffic-agnostic methods, with minimal impact on travel time. The framework is scalable for real-time implementation while effectively addressing uncertainties from dynamic traffic conditions and macroscopic traffic events.

Title: MAKO: Meta-Adaptive Koopman Operators for Learning-based Model Predictive Control of Parametrically Uncertain Nonlinear Systems
Authors: Minghao Han, Kiwan Wong, Adrian Wing-Keung Law, Xunyuan Yin
Abstract: In this work, we propose a meta-learning-based Koopman modeling and predictive control approach for nonlinear systems with parametric uncertainties. An adaptive deep meta-learning-based modeling approach, called Meta Adaptive Koopman Operator (MAKO), is proposed. Without knowledge of the parametric uncertainty, the proposed MAKO approach can learn a meta-model from a multi-modal dataset and efficiently adapt to new systems with previously unseen parameter settings by using online data. Based on the learned meta Koopman model, a predictive control scheme is developed, and the stability of the closed-loop system is ensured even in the presence of previously unseen parameter settings. Through extensive simulations, our proposed approach demonstrates superior performance in both modeling accuracy and control efficacy as compared to competitive baselines.

Title: Sensing, Detection and Localization for Low Altitude UAV: A RF-Based Framework via Multiple BSs Collaboration
Authors: Tianhao Liang, Mu Jia, Tingting Zhang, Junting Chen, Longyu Zhou, Tony Q. S. Quek, Pooi-Yuen Kam
Abstract: The rapid growth of the low-altitude economy has resulted in a significant increase in the number of Low, slow, and small (LLS) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), raising critical challenges for secure airspace management and reliable trajectory planning. To address this, this paper proposes a cooperative radio-frequency (RF) detection and localization framework that leverages existing cellular base stations. The proposed approach features a robust scheme for LSS target identification, integrating a cell averaging-constant false alarm rate (CA-CFAR) detector with a micro-Doppler signature (MDS) based recognition method. Multi-station measurements are fused through a grid-based probabilistic algorithm combined with clustering techniques, effectively mitigating ghost targets and improving localization accuracy in multi-UAV scenarios. Furthermore, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived as a performance benchmark and reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization is employed to balance localization accuracy against station resource usage. Simulations demonstrate that increasing from one to multiple BSs reduces the positioning error to near the CRLB, while practical experiments further verify the framework's effectiveness. Furthermore, our RL-based optimization can find solutions that maintain high accuracy while minimizing resource usage, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for ensuring airspace safety in the emerging low-altitude economy.

Title: Pinching-Antenna Assisted Sensing: A Bayesian Cramér-Rao Bound Perspective
Authors: Hao Jiang, Chongjun Ouyang, Zhaolin Wang, Yuanwei Liu, Arumugam Nallanathan, Zhiguo Ding
Abstract: The fundamental sensing limit of pinching-antenna systems (PASS) is studied from a Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound (BCRB) perspective. Compared to conventional CRB, BCRB is independent of the exact values of sensing parameters and is not restricted by the unbiasedness of the estimator, thus offering a practical and comprehensive lower bound for evaluating sensing performance. A system where multiple targets transmit uplink pilots to a single-waveguide PASS under a time-division multiple access (TDMA) scheme is analyzed. For the single-target scenario, our analysis reveals a unique mismatch between the sensing centroid (i.e., the optimal PA position) and the distribution centroid (i.e., the center of the target's prior distribution), underscoring the necessity of dynamic PA repositioning. For the multi-target scenario, two target scheduling protocols are proposed: 1) pinch switching (PS), which performs separate pinching beamforming for each time slot, and 2) pinch multiplexing (PM), which applies a single beamforming configuration across all slots. Based on these protocols, both the total power minimization problem under a BCRB threshold and the min-max BCRB problem under a total power constraint are formulated. By leveraging Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, these problems are equivalently converted into a search over PA positions and solved using an element-wise algorithm. Numerical results show that i)~PASS, endowed with large-scale reconfigurability, can significantly enhance the sensing performance compared with conventional fixed-position arrays, and ii)~PS provides more robust performances than PM at the cost of higher computational complexity.

Title: Antenna's Performance in Microwave Imaging of Stratified Media
Authors: Adel Omrani, Sajjad Sadeghi
Abstract: Numerous types of antennas have been employed for microwave imaging of stratified media for ground penetrating radar (GPR), through-the-wall-radar imaging (TWRI), etc. This letter aims to investigate the impact of the different antennas with their characteristics on the image reconstruction of those media. Hence, three types of antennas, including horn antennas, open waveguide and Vivaldi antennas, are chosen as almost directional antennas, operating at X-band 8-12 GHz. The antenna's far-field and near-field characteristics are analyzed. A diffraction tomography (DT)-based algorithm is used to reconstruct the target location within the stratified media using monostatic and multistatic data. It is observed that the more directional antennas provide a better-reconstructed image with less shadowing image of the stratified media.

Title: Topological Signal Processing Over Cell MultiComplexes Via Cross-Laplacian Operators
Authors: Stefania Sardellitti, Breno C. Bispo, Fernando A. N. Santos, Juliano B. Lima
Abstract: One of the key challenges in many research fields is uncovering how different interconnected systems interact within complex networks, typically represented as multi-layer networks. Capturing the intra- and cross-layer interactions among different domains for analysis and processing calls for topological algebraic descriptors capable of localizing the homologies of different domains, at different scales, according to the learning task. Our first contribution in this paper is to introduce the Cell MultiComplexes (CMCs), which are novel topological spaces that enable the representation of higher-order interactions among interconnected cell complexes. We introduce cross-Laplacian operators as powerful algebraic descriptors of CMC spaces able to capture different topological invariants, whether global or local, at different resolutions. Using the eigenvectors of these operators as bases for the signal representation, we develop topological signal processing tools for signals defined over CMCs. Then, we focus on the signal spectral representation and on the filtering of noisy flows observed over the cross-edges between different layers of CMCs. We show that a local signal representation based on cross-Laplacians yields a better sparsity/accuracy trade-off compared to monocomplex representations, which provide overcomplete representation of local signals. Finally, we illustrate a topology learning strategy designed to infer second-order cross-cells between layers, with applications to brain networks for encoding inter-module connectivity patterns.

Title: Enhanced Breakdown and RF Performance in Field-Plated AlGaN/GaN HEMT for High-Power Applications
Authors: Tanjim Rahman, Trupti Ranjan Lenka
Abstract: High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs) are most suitable for harsh environments as they operate reliably under extreme conditions such as high voltages, high temperatures, radiation exposure and corrosive atmospheres. In this article, gate field-plated engineering Al0.295GaN/GaN HEMT is proposed for achieving high breakdown voltage to reliably operate in harsh environments. The Al0.295GaN/GaN heterointerface results in a 2DEG (two-dimensional electron gas) density of the order of 1013 cm-2 obtained from the self-consistent solution of Schrödinger and Poisson equations. The device has undergone DC and breakdown simulations which result in threshold voltage of -5.5 V, drain saturation current of 3000 mA, and breakdown voltage of 1 kV. The HEMT also shows excellent RF characteristics which include cut-off frequency (ft) of 28 GHz and maximum frequency of oscillation (fmax) of 38 GHz. The proposed gate field-plated HEMT is stable up to 40 GHz and suitable for high-voltage and high-power RF operation during harsh environment applications.

Title: Impact of HRTF individualisation and head movements in a real/virtual localisation task
Authors: Vincent Martin, Lorenzo Picinali
Abstract: The objective of Audio Augmented Reality (AAR) applications are to seamlessly integrate virtual sound sources within a real environment. It is critical for these applications that virtual sources are localised precisely at the intended position, and that the acoustic environments are accurately matched. One effective method for spatialising sound on headphones is through Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs). These characterise how the physical features of a listener modify sound waves before they reach the eardrum. This study examines the influence of using individualised HRTFs on the localisation and the perceived realism of virtual sound sources associated with a real visual object. Participants were tasked with localising virtual and real speech sources presented via headphones and through a spherical loudspeaker array, respectively. The assessment focussed on perceived realism and sources location. All sources were associated with one of thirty real visual sources (loudspeakers) arranged in a semi-anechoic room. Various sound source renderings were compared, including single loudspeaker rendering and binaural rendering with individualised or non-individualised HRTFs. Additionally, the impact of head movements was explored: ten participants completed the same task with and without the possibility to move their head. The results showed that using individual HRTFs improved perceived realism but not localisation performance in the static scenario. Surprisingly, the opposite was observed when head movements were possible and encouraged.

Title: Robust Adaptive Boundary Control of a Thermal Process with Thermoelectric Actuators: Theory and Experimental Validation
Authors: Paul Mayr, Alessandro Pisano, Stefan Koch, Markus Reichhartinger
Abstract: A sliding-mode-based adaptive boundary control law is proposed for a class of uncertain thermal reaction-diffusion processes subject to matched disturbances. The disturbances are assumed to be bounded, but the corresponding bounds are unknown, thus motivating the use of adaptive control strategies. A boundary control law comprising a proportional and discontinuous term is proposed, wherein the magnitude of the discontinuous relay term is adjusted via a gradient-based adaptation algorithm. Depending on how the adaptation algorithm is parameterized, the adaptive gain can be either a nondecreasing function of time (monodirectional adaptation) or it can both increase and decrease (bidirectional adaptation). The convergence and stability properties of these two solutions are investigated by Lyapunov analyses, and two distinct stability results are derived, namely, asymptotic stability for the monodirectional adaptation and globally uniformly ultimately bounded solutions for the bidirectional adaptation. The proposed algorithms are then specified to address the control problem of stabilizing a desired temperature profile in a metal beam equipped with thermoelectric boundary actuators. Experiments are conducted to investigate the real-world performance of the proposed sliding-mode-based adaptive control, with a particular focus on comparing the monodirectional and bidirectional adaptation laws.

Title: Learning Product Graphs from Two-dimensional Stationary Signals
Authors: Andrei Buciulea, Bishwadeep Das, Elvin Isufi, Antonio G. Marques
Abstract: Graph learning aims to infer a network structure directly from observed data, enabling the analysis of complex dependencies in irregular domains. Traditional methods focus on scalar signals at each node, ignoring dependencies along additional dimensions such as time, configurations of the observation device, or populations. In this work, we propose a graph signal processing framework for learning graphs from two-dimensional signals, modeled as matrix graph signals generated by joint filtering along both dimensions. This formulation leverages the concept of graph stationarity across the two dimensions and leverages product graph representations to capture structured dependencies. Based on this model, we design an optimization problem that can be solved efficiently and provably recovers the optimal underlying Kronecker/Cartesian/strong product graphs. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate that our approach achieves higher estimation accuracy and reduced computational cost compared to existing methods.

Title: Unsupervised lexicon learning from speech is limited by representations rather than clustering
Authors: Danel Adendorff, Simon Malan, Herman Kamper
Abstract: Zero-resource word segmentation and clustering systems aim to tokenise speech into word-like units without access to text labels. Despite progress, the induced lexicons are still far from perfect. In an idealised setting with gold word boundaries, we ask whether performance is limited by the representation of word segments, or by the clustering methods that group them into word-like types. We combine a range of self-supervised speech features (continuous/discrete, frame/word-level) with different clustering methods (K-means, hierarchical, graph-based) on English and Mandarin data. The best system uses graph clustering with dynamic time warping on continuous features. Faster alternatives use graph clustering with cosine distance on averaged continuous features or edit distance on discrete unit sequences. Through controlled experiments that isolate either the representations or the clustering method, we demonstrate that representation variability across segments of the same word type -- rather than clustering -- is the primary factor limiting performance.

Title: Energy-Efficient Power Control in Single-User M-MIMO-OFDM System with PA Nonlinearity
Authors: Siddarth Marwaha, Pawel Kryszkiewicz, Eduard A. Jorswieck
Abstract: Although multiple works have proposed energy-efficient resource allocation schemes for Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (M-MIMO) system, most approaches overlook the potential of optimizing Power Amplifier (PA) transmission power while accounting for non-linear distortion effects. Furthermore, most M-MIMO studies assume narrow-band transmission, neglecting subcarrier intermodulations at the non-linear PA for an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system. Therefore, this work investigates the energy-efficient power allocation for a single-user equipment (UE) M-MIMO downlink (DL) system employing OFDM with nonlinear PAs. Unlike prior works, we model wide-band transmission using a soft-limiter PA model and derive a closed-form expression for the signal-to-distortion-and-noise ratio (SNDR) under Rayleigh fading and Maximal Ratio Transmission (MRT) precoding. Next, the Energy Efficiency (EE) function is defined considering two PA architectures and a distorted OFDM signal. We then propose a low complexity root-finding algorithm to maximize EE by transmit power adjustment. Simulation results demonstrate significant EE gains over a fixed PA back-off baseline, with over $100\%$ improvement under both low and high path loss. Our findings reveal how the optimal operating point depends on the antenna count, the PA model, and the propagation conditions.

Title: Effects of automotive microphone frequency response characteristics and noise conditions on speech and ASR quality -- an experimental evaluation
Authors: Michele Buccoli, Yu Du, Jacob Soendergaard, Simone Shawn Cazzaniga
Abstract: Upon choosing microphones for automotive hands-free communication or Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) applications, OEMs typically specify wideband, super wideband or even fullband requirements following established standard recommendations (e.g., ITU-P.1110, ITU-P.1120). In practice, it is often challenging to achieve the preferred bandwidth for an automotive microphone when considering limitations and constraints on microphone placement inside the cabin, and the automotive grade environmental robustness requirements. On the other hand, there seems to be no consensus or sufficient data on the effect of each microphone characteristic on the actual performance. As an attempt to answer this question, we used noise signals recorded in real vehicles and under various driving conditions to experimentally study the relationship between the microphones' characteristics and the final audio quality of speech communication and performance of ASR engines. We focus on how variations in microphone bandwidth and amplitude frequency response shapes affect the perceptual speech quality. The speech quality results are compared by using ETSI TS 103 281 metrics (S-MOS, N-MOS, G-MOS) and ancillary metrics such as SNR. The ASR results are evaluated with standard metrics such as Word Error Rate (WER). Findings from this study provide knowledge in the understanding of what microphone frequency response characteristics are more relevant for audio quality and choice of proper microphone specifications, particularly for automotive applications.

Title: Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for PA Distortion-Aware M-MIMO OFDM System
Authors: Siddarth Marwaha, Pawel Kryszkiewicz, Eduard Jorswieck
Abstract: Maintaining high energy efficiency (EE) in wireless networks is crucial, particularly with the adoption of massive MIMO technology. This work introduces a resource allocation framework that jointly optimizes transmit power assigned to each user and the number of active antennas, while explicitly accounting for a nonlinear Power Amplifier (PA). We consider a downlink MU-MIMO-OFDM transmission with zero forcing (ZF) precoding, Rayleigh fading channels, and soft-limiter PAs, with both ideal and realistic PA architectures. In contrast to existing formulations, our optimization framework avoids imposing an explicit transmit power constraint, since the nonlinear distortion inherently limits the feasible operating region. To solve the resulting non-convex problem, an alternating optimization approach is adopted that, by exploiting properties of the EE function, guarantees convergence to a stationary point. Extensive simulations demonstrate consistent performance gains over distortion-neglecting and power-only optimized baselines. In a scenario of a 5 km radius cell serving 60 randomly distributed users, the median EE gains over the distortion-neglecting allocation reach 40% for ideal PAs and 20% for Class B PAs, confirming high impact of the proposed solution.

Title: Single vs Multi Vector Predictive Control of Five-phase Drives
Authors: Manuel R. Arahal, Manuel G. Satué, Kumars Rouzbehi, Juana M. Martínez-Heredia
Abstract: The field of Finite State Model Predictive Control for multiphase drives has produced many contributions. Many variants of FSMPC exist, each aiming at some aspect such as complexity of the cost function, switching frequency, etc. Despite past efforts to compare different techniques, the field is still out of consensus regarding the relative merits of each one. This paper presents a new method to compare FSMPC variants. The method is based on analyzing the modulation, implicit or explicit, used by each variant. In the paper the method is used to compare single-vector state-of-the-art FSMPC with a multi-vector variant designed to cancel xy currents and simplify the cost function. The results show the strengths and weaknesses of each technique. Also, it is found that the trade-offs between figures, previously thought to concern just individual regimes, extend to the whole operating space and also can be pinpoint to each FSMPC variant. Finally, it is shown that the flexibility of the single-vector approach and its better DC-link usage makes it, arguably, superior over the multi-vector variant.

Title: Safety Analysis of eVTOL Operations based on STPA
Authors: Mariat James Elizebeth, Shufeng Chen, Halima El Badaoui, Siddartha Khastgir, Paul Jennings
Abstract: Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft are expected to be quieter and more cost-effective than helicopters, offering major economic and social benefits through improved connectivity. Their adoption will require new ground infrastructure and airspace redesign, introducing risks involving multiple stakeholders (Regulators, eVTOL operators, Air navigation service providers, Vertiport operators, OEMs, Pilots, etc.). To assess these risks for the UK airspace, systems-thinking based System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) was conducted. To manage the large number of Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs) and requirements generated due to the complexity of the analysis, a novel extension to STPA for the prioritization of results was applied. 317 UCAs were identified in total out of which 110 high-priority UCAs were analyzed (Step-4), resulting in 377 causal factors and 432 requirements. These were prioritized to produce a targeted list of 124 distinct high-priority requirements, 56 of which were identified as gaps in existing aviation regulations, policies, or procedures.. These highlight opportunities for regulatory updates in areas such as organizational performance, certification processes, training, collision avoidance, energy management, and automation. The findings provide regulators with safety considerations that could shape new or updated regulations, compliance methods, and guidance materials for the safe deployment of eVTOLs.

Title: Weighting Factors Tuning by Direct Feedback in Predictive Control of Multiphase Motors
Authors: Manuel R. Arahal, Manuel G. Satué, Kumars Rouzbehi, Francisco Colodro
Abstract: Predictive Stator Current Control (PSCC) has been proposed for control of multi-phase drives. The flexibility offered by the use of a Cost Function has been used to deal with the increased number of phases. However, tuning of the Weighting Factors constitutes a problem. Intensive trial and error tests are usual in this context. Existing on-line selection methods, on the other hand, require large amounts of data and/or complex optimization procedures. The proposal of this paper is a closed-loop scheme that links Weighting Factors to performance indicators. In this way, optimal Weighting Factors are determined for each operating point. Also, changes in reference values for performance indicators are easily tackled. Unlike previous methods, the proposal carries very little computational burden. A case study is developed for a five-phase induction motor and assessed with real experimentation on a laboratory set-up.

Title: Data-Driven Control Of Power Converters
Authors: Marwan Soliman, Pauline Kergus, Diego Regruto, Luiz Villa, Zohra Kader
Abstract: The fundamental role of power converters is to efficiently manage and control the flow of electrical energy, ensuring compatibility between power sources and loads. All these applications of power converters need the design of an appropriate control law. Control of power converters is a challenging problem due to the presence of switching devices which are difficult to handle using traditional control approaches. The objective of this paper is to investigate the use of data-driven techniques, in particular the Virtual References Feedback Tuning (VRFT) method, in the context of power converters feedback control. This study considers a buck \pauline{mode} power converter circuit provided by the OwnTech foundation.

Title: Rewiring Development in Brain Segmentation: Leveraging Adult Brain Priors for Enhancing Infant MRI Segmentation
Authors: Alemu Sisay Nigru, Michele Svanera, Austin Dibble, Connor Dalby, Mattia Savardi, Sergio Benini
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of infant brain MRI is critical for studying early neurodevelopment and diagnosing neurological disorders. Yet, it remains a fundamental challenge due to continuously evolving anatomy of the subjects, motion artifacts, and the scarcity of high-quality labeled data. In this work, we present LODi, a novel framework that utilizes prior knowledge from an adult brain MRI segmentation model to enhance the segmentation performance of infant scans. Given the abundance of publicly available adult brain MRI data, we pre-train a segmentation model on a large adult dataset as a starting point. Through transfer learning and domain adaptation strategies, we progressively adapt the model to the 0-2 year-old population, enabling it to account for the anatomical and imaging variability typical of infant scans. The adaptation of the adult model is carried out using weakly supervised learning on infant brain scans, leveraging silver-standard ground truth labels obtained with FreeSurfer. By introducing a novel training strategy that integrates hierarchical feature refinement and multi-level consistency constraints, our method enables fast, accurate, age-adaptive segmentation, while mitigating scanner and site-specific biases. Extensive experiments on both internal and external datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over traditional supervised learning and domain-specific models. Our findings highlight the advantage of leveraging adult brain priors as a foundation for age-flexible neuroimaging analysis, paving the way for more reliable and generalizable brain MRI segmentation across the lifespan.

Title: Target speaker anonymization in multi-speaker recordings
Authors: Natalia Tomashenko, Junichi Yamagishi, Xin Wang, Yun Liu, Emmanuel Vincent
Abstract: Most of the existing speaker anonymization research has focused on single-speaker audio, leading to the development of techniques and evaluation metrics optimized for such condition. This study addresses the significant challenge of speaker anonymization within multi-speaker conversational audio, specifically when only a single target speaker needs to be anonymized. This scenario is highly relevant in contexts like call centers, where customer privacy necessitates anonymizing only the customer's voice in interactions with operators. Conventional anonymization methods are often not suitable for this task. Moreover, current evaluation methodology does not allow us to accurately assess privacy protection and utility in this complex multi-speaker scenario. This work aims to bridge these gaps by exploring effective strategies for targeted speaker anonymization in conversational audio, highlighting potential problems in their development and proposing corresponding improved evaluation methodologies.

Title: MIP-Based Tumor Segmentation: A Radiologist-Inspired Approach
Authors: Romario Zarik, Nahum Kiryati, Michael Green, Liran Domachevsky, Arnaldo Mayer
Abstract: PET/CT imaging is the gold standard for tumor detection, offering high accuracy in identifying local and metastatic lesions. Radiologists often begin assessment with rotational Multi-Angle Maximum Intensity Projections (MIPs) from PET, confirming findings with volumetric slices. This workflow is time-consuming, especially in metastatic cases. Despite their clinical utility, MIPs are underutilized in automated tumor segmentation, where 3D volumetric data remains the norm. We propose an alternative approach that trains segmentation models directly on MIPs, bypassing the need to segment 3D volumes and then project. This better aligns the model with its target domain and yields substantial gains in computational efficiency and training time. We also introduce a novel occlusion correction method that restores MIP annotations occluded by high-intensity structures, improving segmentation. Using the autoPET 2022 Grand Challenge dataset, we evaluate our method against standard 3D pipelines in terms of performance and training/computation efficiency for segmentation and classification, and analyze how MIP count affects segmentation. Our MIP-based approach achieves segmentation performance on par with 3D (<=1% Dice difference, 26.7% better Hausdorff Distance), while reducing training time (convergence time) by 55.8-75.8%, energy per epoch by 71.7-76%, and TFLOPs by two orders of magnitude, highlighting its scalability for clinical use. For classification, using 16 MIPs only as input, we surpass 3D performance while reducing training time by over 10x and energy consumption per epoch by 93.35%. Our analysis of the impact of MIP count on segmentation identified 48 views as optimal, offering the best trade-off between performance and efficiency.

Title: MPA-DNN: Projection-Aware Unsupervised Learning for Multi-period DC-OPF
Authors: Yeomoon Kim, Minsoo Kim, Jip Kim
Abstract: Ensuring both feasibility and efficiency in optimal power flow (OPF) operations has become increasingly important in modern power systems with high penetrations of renewable energy and energy storage. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as promising fast surrogates for OPF solvers, they often fail to satisfy critical operational constraints, especially those involving inter-temporal coupling, such as generator ramping limits and energy storage operations. To deal with these issues, we propose a Multi-Period Projection-Aware Deep Neural Network (MPA-DNN) that incorporates a projection layer for multi-period dispatch into the network. By doing so, our model enforces physical feasibility through the projection, enabling end-to-end learning of constraint-compliant dispatch trajectories without relying on labeled data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves near-optimal performance while strictly satisfying all constraints in varying load conditions.

Title: A Biophysically-Conditioned Generative Framework for 3D Brain Tumor MRI Synthesis
Authors: Valentin Biller, Lucas Zimmer, Can Erdur, Sandeep Nagar, Daniel Rückert, Niklas Bubeck, Jonas Weidner
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) inpainting supports numerous clinical and research applications. We introduce the first generative model that conditions on voxel-level, continuous tumor concentrations to synthesize high-fidelity brain tumor MRIs. For the BraTS 2025 Inpainting Challenge, we adapt this architecture to the complementary task of healthy tissue restoration by setting the tumor concentrations to zero. Our latent diffusion model conditioned on both tissue segmentations and the tumor concentrations generates 3D spatially coherent and anatomically consistent images for both tumor synthesis and healthy tissue inpainting. For healthy inpainting, we achieve a PSNR of 18.5, and for tumor inpainting, we achieve 17.4. Our code is available at: this https URL

Title: Optical Link Tomography: First Field Trial and 4D Extension

Abstract: Optical link tomography (OLT) is a rapidly evolving field that allows the multi-span, end-to-end visualization of optical power along fiber links in multiple dimensions from network endpoints, solely by processing signals received at coherent receivers. This paper has two objectives: (1) to report the first field trial of OLT, using a commercial transponder under standard DWDM transmission, and (2) to extend its capability to visualize across 4D (distance, time, frequency, and polarization), allowing for locating and measuring multiple QoT degradation causes, including time-varying power anomalies, spectral anomalies, and excessive polarization dependent loss. We also address a critical aspect of OLT, i.e., its need for high fiber launch power, by improving power profile signal-to-noise ratio through averaging across all available dimensions. Consequently, multiple loss anomalies in a field-deployed link are observed even at launch power lower than the system-optimal level. The applications and use cases of OLT from network commissioning to provisioning and operation for current and near-term network scenarios are also discussed.

Title: 3C Resources Joint Allocation for Time-Deterministic Remote Sensing Image Backhaul in the Space-Ground Integrated Network
Authors: Chongxiao Cai, Yan Zhu, Min Sheng, Jiandong Li, Yan Shi, Di Zhou, Ziwen Xie, Chen Zhang
Abstract: Low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites assist observation satellites (OSs) to compress and backhaul more time-determined images (TDI) has become a new paradigm, which is used to enhance the timeout caused by the limited computing resources of OSs. However, how to capture the time-varying and dynamic characteristics of multi-dimensional resources is challenging for efficient collaborative scheduling. Motivated by this factor, we design a highly succinct multi-dimensional resource time-expanded graph (MDR-TEG) modell. Specifically, by employing a slots division mechanism and introducing an external virtual node, the time-varying communication, caching, and computing (3C) resources are depicted in low complexity by the link weights within, between, and outside the slots. Based on the MDR-TEG, the maximizing successful transmission ratio of TDI (MSTR-TDI) is modeled as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. Which further relaxed decomposed into two tractable sub-problems: maximizing the successful transmission rate of images (MSTRI) and ensuring the timeliness problem (ETP). Subsequently, an efficient subgradient of relaxation computing constraint (SRCC) algorithm is proposed. The upper and lower bounds of MSTR-TDI are obtained by solving the two subproblems and the dual problem (DP), and the direction of the next iteration is obtained by feedback. Furthermore, arranging the sending sequences of images to improve the quality of the solution. The approximate optimal solution of MSTR-TDI is eventually obtained through repeated iterations. The simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed MDR-TEG model and the effectiveness of the SRCC.

Title: Grid-forming Control of Converter Infinite Bus System: Modeling by Data-driven Methods
Authors: Amir Bahador Javadi, Philip Pong
Abstract: This study explores data-driven modeling techniques to capture the dynamics of a grid-forming converter-based infinite bus system, critical for renewable-integrated power grids. Using sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics and deep symbolic regression, models were generated from synthetic data simulating key disturbances in active power, reactive power, and voltage references. Deep symbolic regression demonstrated more accuracy in capturing complex system dynamics, though it required substantially more computational time than sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics. These findings suggest that while deep symbolic regression offers high fidelity, sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics provides a more computationally efficient approach, balancing accuracy and runtime for real-time grid applications.

Title: Critical States Identiffcation in Power System via Lattice Partition and Its Application in Reliability Assessment
Authors: Han Hu, Wenjie Wan, Feiyu Chen, Xiaoyu Liu, Bo Yu, Kequan Zhao
Abstract: With the increasing complexity of power systems,accurately identifying critical states (the states corresponding to minimal cut sets) and assessing system reliability have become crucial tasks. In this paper, a mathematical lattice structure is employed to represent and partition the state space of power system. Based on this structure, a novel recursive method is proposed to efffciently identify critical states by leveraging lattice partitioning and Optimal Power Flow(OPF) calculations. This method not only enables the extension of failure system states,but also calculates the upper and lower bounds of the Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) in a progressively converging manner. Compared to traditional reliability assessment methods such as State Enumeration (SE) and Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS), this approach offers greater accuracy and efffciency. Experiments conducted on the RBTS and RTS79 systems demonstrate that the proposed method accurately identiffes all critical states up to a preset order, which are high-risk states. The contribution of these critical states to LOLP highlights their signiffcance in the system. Moreover, the proposed method achieves the analytical value with signiffcantly fewer OPF calculations in RBTS system, reaching acceptable precision of LOLP up to 100 times faster than SE in both the RBTS and RTS systems.

Title: Robust reset control design for piezo-actuated nano-positioner in presence of hysteresis nonlinearity
Authors: Ashkan Sebghati, S. Hassan HosseinNia
Abstract: In this paper, a robust nonlinear control scheme is designed for the motion control of a class of piezo-actuated nano-positioning systems using frequency-domain analysis. The hysteresis, the nonlinearity in the piezoelectric material, degrades the precision in tracking references with high frequency contents and different travel ranges. The hysteresis compensation by the inverse model, as the state-of-the-art solution, is not reliable alone. Therefore, a control framework with robustness against the remaining nonlinearity is needed. It is shown that there is an unavoidable limitation in robust linear control design to improve the performance. A robust control methodology based on a complex-order element is established to relax the limitation. Then, a constant-in-gain-lead-in-phase (CgLp) reset controller is utilized to realize the complex-order control. The control design is based on the sinusoidal input describing function (SIDF) and the higher-order SIDF (HOSIDF) tools. A constrained optimization problem is provided to tune the control parameters. The achieved improvements by the CgLp control is validated by the simulation.

Title: A Study of the Removability of Speaker-Adversarial Perturbations
Authors: Liping Chen, Chenyang Guo, Kong Aik Lee, Zhen-Hua Ling, Wu Guo
Abstract: Recent advancements in adversarial attacks have demonstrated their effectiveness in misleading speaker recognition models, making wrong predictions about speaker identities. On the other hand, defense techniques against speaker-adversarial attacks focus on reducing the effects of speaker-adversarial perturbations on speaker attribute extraction. These techniques do not seek to fully remove the perturbations and restore the original speech. To this end, this paper studies the removability of speaker-adversarial perturbations. Specifically, the investigation is conducted assuming various degrees of awareness of the perturbation generator across three scenarios: ignorant, semi-informed, and well-informed. Besides, we consider both the optimization-based and feedforward perturbation generation methods. Experiments conducted on the LibriSpeech dataset demonstrated that: 1) in the ignorant scenario, speaker-adversarial perturbations cannot be eliminated, although their impact on speaker attribute extraction is reduced, 2) in the semi-informed scenario, the speaker-adversarial perturbations cannot be fully removed, while those generated by the feedforward model can be considerably reduced, and 3) in the well-informed scenario, speaker-adversarial perturbations are nearly eliminated, allowing for the restoration of the original speech.

Title: Spatially-Augmented Sequence-to-Sequence Neural Diarization for Meetings
Authors: Li Li, Ming Cheng, Hongyu Zhang, Juan Liu, Ming Li
Abstract: This paper proposes a Spatially-Augmented Sequence-to-Sequence Neural Diarization (SA-S2SND) framework, which integrates direction-of-arrival (DOA) cues estimated by SRP-DNN into the S2SND backbone. A two-stage training strategy is adopted: the model is first trained with single-channel audio and DOA features, and then further optimized with multi-channel inputs under DOA guidance. In addition, a simulated DOA generation scheme is introduced to alleviate dependence on matched multi-channel corpora. On the AliMeeting dataset, SA-S2SND consistently outperform the S2SND baseline, achieving a 7.4% relative DER reduction in the offline mode and over 19% improvement when combined with channel attention. These results demonstrate that spatial cues are highly complementary to cross-channel modeling, yielding good performance in both online and offline settings.

Title: IF-D: A High-Frequency, General-Purpose Inertial Foundation Dataset for Self-Supervised Learning
Authors: Patrick Ferreira, Paula Costa
Abstract: We present IF-D, a large-scale inertial dataset designed to enable self-supervised and foundational learning for IMU time series. IF-D comprises continuous, long-duration multichannel recordings (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) sampled at 200Hz using a UM7 IMU mounted inside a 3D-printed spherical enclosure that promotes diverse, free rotations during vehicle traversal. The collection spans approximately 135 minutes of recording, yielding around 1.6 million samples across nine sensor channels. We describe the data acquisition setup, preprocessing, and calibration procedures (six-orientation accelerometer calibration, stationary gyroscope bias estimation, and ellipsoid fitting for magnetometer hard-/soft-iron correction), and provide quantitative calibration results. IF-D is designed to mitigate platform specific motion bias and expose models to both physical dynamics and typical measurement noise, thereby facilitating robust representation learning and downstream tasks such as event detection, motion mode recognition, and inertial navigation.

Title: Power Cable Radiation: A Novel Approach to Underground Mining Connectivity
Authors: Siphiwe Shandu, Thabiso Moropa, Alain R. Ndjiongue
Abstract: This letter investigates contactless power line communications (CPLC) for underground mining by modeling power wires as long-wire antennas. A system-level framework is developed, comprising a cascade of RF and power line channels. The model accounts for multipath propagation, frequency-dependent attenuation, and Rician fading. Simulations from 1-20 GHz reveal that the length of the wire significantly affects radiation, directivity, and input impedance. The findings show that CPLC transmits electromagnetic waves without direct electrical contact, offering a robust, cost-effective solution that enhances mobility, reduces maintenance, and ensures compatibility with existing mining power infrastructure.

Title: Soft Graph Transformer for MIMO Detection
Authors: Jiadong Hong, Lei Liu, Xinyu Bian, Wenjie Wang, Zhaoyang Zhang
Abstract: We propose the Soft Graph Transformer (SGT), a soft-input-soft-output neural architecture designed for MIMO detection. While Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection achieves optimal accuracy, its exponential complexity makes it infeasible in large systems, and conventional message-passing algorithms rely on asymptotic assumptions that often fail in finite dimensions. Recent Transformer-based detectors show strong performance but typically overlook the MIMO factor graph structure and cannot exploit prior soft information. SGT addresses these limitations by combining self-attention, which encodes contextual dependencies within symbol and constraint subgraphs, with graph-aware cross-attention, which performs structured message passing across subgraphs. Its soft-input interface allows the integration of auxiliary priors, producing effective soft outputs while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that SGT achieves near-ML performance and offers a flexible and interpretable framework for receiver systems that leverage soft priors.

Title: LadderSym: A Multimodal Interleaved Transformer for Music Practice Error Detection
Authors: Benjamin Shiue-Hal Chou, Purvish Jajal, Nick John Eliopoulos, James C. Davis, George K. Thiruvathukal, Kristen Yeon-Ji Yun, Yung-Hsiang Lu
Abstract: Music learners can greatly benefit from tools that accurately detect errors in their practice. Existing approaches typically compare audio recordings to music scores using heuristics or learnable models. This paper introduces \textit{LadderSym}, a novel Transformer-based method for music error detection. \textit{LadderSym} is guided by two key observations about the state-of-the-art approaches: (1) late fusion limits inter-stream alignment and cross-modality comparison capability; and (2) reliance on score audio introduces ambiguity in the frequency spectrum, degrading performance in music with concurrent notes. To address these limitations, \textit{LadderSym} introduces (1) a two-stream encoder with inter-stream alignment modules to improve audio comparison capabilities and error detection F1 scores, and (2) a multimodal strategy that leverages both audio and symbolic scores by incorporating symbolic representations as decoder prompts, reducing ambiguity and improving F1 scores. We evaluate our method on the \textit{MAESTRO-E} and \textit{CocoChorales-E} datasets by measuring the F1 score for each note category. Compared to the previous state of the art, \textit{LadderSym} more than doubles F1 for missed notes on \textit{MAESTRO-E} (26.8\% $\rightarrow$ 56.3\%) and improves extra note detection by 14.4 points (72.0\% $\rightarrow$ 86.4\%). Similar gains are observed on \textit{CocoChorales-E}. This work introduces general insights about comparison models that could inform sequence evaluation tasks for reinforcement Learning, human skill assessment, and model evaluation.

Title: Evaluating Hallucinations in Multimodal LLMs with Spoken Queries under Diverse Acoustic Conditions
Authors: Hansol Park, Hoseong Ahn, Junwon Moon, Yejin Lee, Kyuhong Shim
Abstract: Hallucinations in vision-language models have been extensively studied using benchmarks that probe reliability in image-text settings. In contrast, the effect of spoken queries on multimodal hallucinations remains largely unexplored, despite the growing role of voice-driven interfaces. In this work, we investigate how spoken input influences hallucinations in multimodal large language models. We present RePOPE-Spk, an audio-augmented extension of the RePOPE benchmark, where queries are provided as speech under diverse acoustic conditions. Using RePOPE-Spk, we systematically evaluate both proprietary and open-source models. Experimental results show that hallucinations escalate when queries are spoken rather than written: error rates increase by 3% under clean speech and by up to 20% with environmental noise. Input order and query length further affect robustness, while strategies such as many-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning offer partial but insufficient mitigation. These findings highlight a critical and underexplored challenge, opening new directions for building reliable voice interface systems.

Title: EGSTalker: Real-Time Audio-Driven Talking Head Generation with Efficient Gaussian Deformation
Authors: Tianheng Zhu, Yinfeng Yu, Liejun Wang, Fuchun Sun, Wendong Zheng
Abstract: This paper presents EGSTalker, a real-time audio-driven talking head generation framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Designed to enhance both speed and visual fidelity, EGSTalker requires only 3-5 minutes of training video to synthesize high-quality facial animations. The framework comprises two key stages: static Gaussian initialization and audio-driven deformation. In the first stage, a multi-resolution hash triplane and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) are used to extract spatial features and construct a compact 3D Gaussian representation. In the second stage, we propose an Efficient Spatial-Audio Attention (ESAA) module to fuse audio and spatial cues, while KAN predicts the corresponding Gaussian deformations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EGSTalker achieves rendering quality and lip-sync accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods, while significantly outperforming them in inference speed. These results highlight EGSTalker's potential for real-time multimedia applications.

Title: Hierarchical Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Depression Detection from Speech
Authors: Yuxin Li, Eng Siong Chng, Cuntai Guan
Abstract: Speech-based depression detection (SDD) is a promising, non-invasive alternative to traditional clinical assessments. However, it remains limited by the difficulty of extracting meaningful features and capturing sparse, heterogeneous depressive cues over time. Pretrained self-supervised learning (SSL) models such as WavLM provide rich, multi-layer speech representations, yet most existing SDD methods rely only on the final layer or search for a single best-performing one. These approaches often overfit to specific datasets and fail to leverage the full hierarchical structure needed to detect subtle and persistent depression signals. To address this challenge, we propose HAREN-CTC, a novel architecture that integrates multi-layer SSL features using cross-attention within a multitask learning framework, combined with Connectionist Temporal Classification loss to handle sparse temporal supervision. HAREN-CTC comprises two key modules: a Hierarchical Adaptive Clustering module that reorganizes SSL features into complementary embeddings, and a Cross-Modal Fusion module that models inter-layer dependencies through cross-attention. The CTC objective enables alignment-aware training, allowing the model to track irregular temporal patterns of depressive speech cues. We evaluate HAREN-CTC under both an upper-bound setting with standard data splits and a generalization setting using five-fold cross-validation. The model achieves state-of-the-art macro F1-scores of 0.81 on DAIC-WOZ and 0.82 on MODMA, outperforming prior methods across both evaluation scenarios.

Title: When to Reason: Semantic Router for vLLM
Authors: Chen Wang, Xunzhuo Liu, Yuhan Liu, Yue Zhu, Xiangxi Mo, Junchen Jiang, Huamin Chen
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate substantial accuracy gains when augmented with reasoning modes such as chain-of-thought and inference-time scaling. However, reasoning also incurs significant costs in inference latency and token usage, with environmental and financial impacts, which are unnecessary for many simple prompts. We present a semantic router that classifies queries based on their reasoning requirements and selectively applies reasoning only when beneficial. Our approach achieves a 10.2 percentage point improvement in accuracy on the MMLU-Pro benchmark while reducing response latency by 47.1% and token consumption by 48.5% compared to direct inference with vLLM. These results demonstrate that semantic routing offers an effective mechanism for striking a balance between accuracy and efficiency in open-source LLM serving systems

Abstract: The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into 5G-Advanced and future 6G networks presents a transformative opportunity for wireless connectivity, enabling agile deployment and improved LoS communications. However, the effective design and optimization of these aerial networks depend critically on high-quality, empirical data. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of publicly available wireless datasets collected from an airborne platform called Aerial Experimentation and Research Platform on Advanced Wireless (AERPAW). We highlight the unique challenges associated with generating reproducible aerial wireless datasets, and review the existing related works in the literature. Subsequently, for each dataset considered, we explain the hardware and software used, present the dataset format, provide representative results, and discuss how these datasets can be used to conduct additional research. The specific aerial wireless datasets presented include raw I/Q samples from a cellular network over different UAV trajectories, spectrum measurements at different altitudes, flying 4G base station (BS), a 5G-NSA Ericsson network, a LoRaWAN network, an radio frequency (RF) sensor network for source localization, wireless propagation data for various scenarios, and comparison of ray tracing and real-world propagation scenarios. References to all datasets and post-processing scripts are provided to enable full reproducibility of the results. Ultimately, we aim to guide the community toward effective dataset utilization for validating propagation models, developing machine learning algorithms, and advancing the next generation of aerial wireless systems.

Title: Whole Body Model Predictive Control for Spin-Aware Quadrupedal Table Tennis
Authors: David Nguyen, Zulfiqar Zaidi, Kevin Karol, Jessica Hodgins, Zhaoming Xie
Abstract: Developing table tennis robots that mirror human speed, accuracy, and ability to predict and respond to the full range of ball spins remains a significant challenge for legged robots. To demonstrate these capabilities we present a system to play dynamic table tennis for quadrupedal robots that integrates high speed perception, trajectory prediction, and agile control. Our system uses external cameras for high-speed ball localization, physical models with learned residuals to infer spin and predict trajectories, and a novel model predictive control (MPC) formulation for agile full-body control. Notably, a continuous set of stroke strategies emerge automatically from different ball return objectives using this control paradigm. We demonstrate our system in the real world on a Spot quadruped, evaluate accuracy of each system component, and exhibit coordination through the system's ability to aim and return balls with varying spin types. As a further demonstration, the system is able to rally with human players.

Title: On Estimation of Angles of Arrival in Monostatic ISAC Without Instantaneous Transmit CSI
Authors: Ataher Sams, Simone Di Bari, Besma Smida, Natasha Devroye, Daniela Tuninetti, Giorgio Taricco
Abstract: This paper explores the fundamental limits of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) in a more realistic setting compared to previous literature when the Base Staion (BS) has only statistical CSI of the communication user rather than full CSI. We analyze a monostatic setting where the BS performs multi-target Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation while simultaneously communicating with one of the targets. We assume that the BS has statistical CSI about all AoAs, with less uncertainty in the AoA of the communication receiver. The communication receiver is assumed to have perfect CSI. Utilizing a Bayesian Cramér-Rao Bound (BCRB) framework to characterize the fundamental limits of sensing under minimum mean square error (MMSE) criteria, we derive achievable BCRB-rate trade-off regions. Our approach introduces a number of transmission strategies that share power across sensing and communication beams over a coherence time. Our analysis reveals that beam allocation strategies leveraging the principal eigenvectors of the target-specific sensing matrices minimize individual AoA estimation errors, while strategies balancing sensing and communication directions optimize joint estimation performance at the cost of individual accuracy. We demonstrate that leveraging updated BCRB-based sensing information for the communication receiver, due to its lower channel uncertainty, enables significantly improved communication rates.

Title: Audible Networks: Deconstructing and Manipulating Sounds with Deep Non-Negative Autoencoders
Authors: Juan José Burred, Carmine-Emanuele Cella
Abstract: We propose the use of Non-Negative Autoencoders (NAEs) for sound deconstruction and user-guided manipulation of sounds for creative purposes. NAEs offer a versatile and scalable extension of traditional Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)-based approaches for interpretable audio decomposition. By enforcing non-negativity constraints through projected gradient descent, we obtain decompositions where internal weights and activations can be directly interpreted as spectral shapes and temporal envelopes, and where components can themselves be listened to as individual sound events. In particular, multi-layer Deep NAE architectures enable hierarchical representations with an adjustable level of granularity, allowing sounds to be deconstructed at multiple levels of abstraction: from high-level note envelopes down to fine-grained spectral details. This framework enables a wide new range of expressive, controllable, and randomized sound transformations. We introduce novel manipulation operations including cross-component and cross-layer synthesis, hierarchical deconstructions, and several randomization strategies that control timbre and event density. Through visualizations and resynthesis of practical examples, we demonstrate how NAEs can serve as flexible and interpretable tools for object-based sound editing.

Title: Optimal Control with Lyapunov Stability Guarantees for Space Applications
Authors: Abhijeet, Mohamed Naveed Gul Mohamed, Aayushman Sharma, Suman Chakravorty
Abstract: This paper investigates the infinite horizon optimal control problem (OCP) for space applications characterized by nonlinear dynamics. The proposed approach divides the problem into a finite horizon OCP with a regularized terminal cost, guiding the system towards a terminal set, and an infinite horizon linear regulation phase within this set. This strategy guarantees global asymptotic stability under specific assumptions. Our method maintains the system's fully nonlinear dynamics until it reaches the terminal set, where the system dynamics is linearized. As the terminal set converges to the origin, the difference in optimal cost incurred reduces to zero, guaranteeing an efficient and stable solution. The approach is tested through simulations on three problems: spacecraft attitude control, rendezvous maneuver, and soft landing. In spacecraft attitude control, we focus on achieving precise orientation and stabilization. For rendezvous maneuvers, we address the navigation of a chaser to meet a target spacecraft. For the soft landing problem, we ensure a controlled descent and touchdown on a planetary surface. We provide numerical results confirming the effectiveness of the proposed method in managing these nonlinear dynamics problems, offering robust solutions essential for successful space missions.

Title: ControlAudio: Tackling Text-Guided, Timing-Indicated and Intelligible Audio Generation via Progressive Diffusion Modeling
Authors: Yuxuan Jiang, Zehua Chen, Zeqian Ju, Yusheng Dai, Weibei Dou, Jun Zhu
Abstract: Text-to-audio (TTA) generation with fine-grained control signals, e.g., precise timing control or intelligible speech content, has been explored in recent works. However, constrained by data scarcity, their generation performance at scale is still compromised. In this study, we recast controllable TTA generation as a multi-task learning problem and introduce a progressive diffusion modeling approach, ControlAudio. Our method adeptly fits distributions conditioned on more fine-grained information, including text, timing, and phoneme features, through a step-by-step strategy. First, we propose a data construction method spanning both annotation and simulation, augmenting condition information in the sequence of text, timing, and phoneme. Second, at the model training stage, we pretrain a diffusion transformer (DiT) on large-scale text-audio pairs, achieving scalable TTA generation, and then incrementally integrate the timing and phoneme features with unified semantic representations, expanding controllability. Finally, at the inference stage, we propose progressively guided generation, which sequentially emphasizes more fine-grained information, aligning inherently with the coarse-to-fine sampling nature of DiT. Extensive experiments show that ControlAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of temporal accuracy and speech clarity, significantly outperforming existing methods on both objective and subjective evaluations.

Title: Observation Matrix Design for Densifying MIMO Channel Estimation via 2D Ice Filling
Authors: Zijian Zhang, Mingyao Cui
Abstract: In recent years, densifying multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has attracted much attention from the communication community. Thanks to the subwavelength antenna spacing, the strong correlations among densifying antennas provide sufficient prior knowledge about channel state information (CSI). This inspires the careful design of observation matrices (e.g., transmit precoders and receive combiners), that exploits the CSI prior knowledge, to boost channel estimation performance. Aligned with this vision, this work proposes to jointly design the combiners and precoders by maximizing the mutual information between the received pilots and densifying MIMO channels. A two-dimensional ice-filling (2DIF) algorithm is proposed to efficiently accomplish this objective. The algorithm is motivated by the fact that the eigenspace of MIMO channel covariance can be decoupled into two sub-eigenspaces, which are associated with the correlations of transmitter antennas and receiver antennas, respectively. By properly setting the precoder and the combiner as the eigenvectors from these two sub-eigenspaces, the 2DIF promises to generate near-optimal observation matrices. Moreover, we further extend the 2DIF method to the popular hybrid combining systems, where a two-stage 2DIF (TS-2DIF) algorithm is developed to handle the analog combining circuits realized by phase shifters. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to the state-of-the-art schemes, the proposed 2DIF and TS-2DIF methods can achieve superior channel estimation accuracy.

Title: VM-UNSSOR: Unsupervised Neural Speech Separation Enhanced by Higher-SNR Virtual Microphone Arrays
Authors: Shulin He, Zhong-Qiu Wang
Abstract: Blind speech separation (BSS) aims to recover multiple speech sources from multi-channel, multi-speaker mixtures under unknown array geometry and room impulse responses. In unsupervised setup where clean target speech is not available for model training, UNSSOR proposes a mixture consistency (MC) loss for training deep neural networks (DNN) on over-determined training mixtures to realize unsupervised speech separation. However, when the number of microphones of the training mixtures decreases, the MC constraint weakens and the separation performance falls dramatically. To address this, we propose VM-UNSSOR, augmenting the observed training mixture signals recorded by a limited number of microphones with several higher-SNR virtual-microphone (VM) signals, which are obtained by applying linear spatial demixers (such as IVA and spatial clustering) to the observed training mixtures. As linear projections of the observed mixtures, the virtual-microphone signals can typically increase the SNR of each source and can be leveraged to compute extra MC losses to improve UNSSOR and address the frequency permutation problem in UNSSOR. On the SMS-WSJ dataset, in the over-determined six-microphone, two-speaker separation setup, VM-UNSSOR reaches 17.1 dB SI-SDR, while UNSSOR only obtains 14.7 dB; and in the determined two-microphone, two-speaker case, UNSSOR collapses to -2.7 dB SI-SDR, while VM-UNSSOR achieves 10.7 dB.

Authors: Jean Pierre Ndabakuranye, Inge W.G. Last, Kay Weng Choy, Peter Thurgood, Jason C. Steel, Genia Burchall, Stella Stylianou, Khashayar Khoshmanesh, Arman Ahnood
Abstract: Objective The concentration of bilirubin in blood or serum is useful for assessing liver function as well as monitoring treatment. This study evaluates the clinical performance of a novel point-of-care (PoC) device for the detection of bilirubin in serum. The PoC device incorporates an integrated miniature optoelectronic sensing module and a microfluidic test cartridge. Methods Patients' serum total bilirubin concentrations, ranging from 2 {\mu}mol/L to 480 {\mu}mol/L, were measured using the PoC device and the standard laboratory method (n=20). Bland-Altman analysis and regression analysis using Passing-Bablok method were used to benchmark the PoC device against the standard laboratory measurements. The diagnostic capability of the PoC device in categorising the serum samples within clinically relevant bilirubin concentration thresholds of 200, 300, and 450 {\mu}mol/L was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results The mean difference between the PoC device and the standard laboratory method was -5.6 {\mu}mol/L, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of -45.1 {\mu}mol/L to 33.9 {\mu}mol/L. The coefficient of determination (R2) was 0.986. The PoC device achieved a detection sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 97% in categorising bilirubin concentrations within bands used in clinical decision-making. Conclusions This study demonstrates that the proposed PoC device is capable of measuring bilirubin levels in patient samples with clinically acceptable accuracy.

Title: Direct Data-Driven Predictive Control for a Three-dimensional Cable-Driven Soft Robotic Arm
Authors: Cheng Ouyang, Moeen Ul Islam, Dong Chen, Kaixiang Zhang, Zhaojian Li, Xiaobo Tan
Abstract: Soft robots offer significant advantages in safety and adaptability, yet achieving precise and dynamic control remains a major challenge due to their inherently complex and nonlinear dynamics. Recently, Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) has emerged as a promising model-free approach that bypasses explicit system identification by directly leveraging input-output data. While DeePC has shown success in other domains, its application to soft robots remains underexplored, particularly for three-dimensional (3D) soft robotic systems. This paper addresses this gap by developing and experimentally validating an effective DeePC framework on a 3D, cable-driven soft arm. Specifically, we design and fabricate a soft robotic arm with a thick tubing backbone for stability, a dense silicone body with large cavities for strength and flexibility, and rigid endcaps for secure termination. Using this platform, we implement DeePC with singular value decomposition (SVD)-based dimension reduction for two key control tasks: fixed-point regulation and trajectory tracking in 3D space. Comparative experiments with a baseline model-based controller demonstrate DeePC's superior accuracy, robustness, and adaptability, highlighting its potential as a practical solution for dynamic control of soft robots.

Title: Trust Modeling and Estimation in Human-Autonomy Interactions
Authors: Daniel A. Williams, Airlie Chapman, Daniel R. Little, Chris Manzie
Abstract: Advances in the control of autonomous systems have accompanied an expansion in the potential applications for autonomous robotic systems. The success of applications involving humans depends on the quality of interaction between the autonomous system and the human supervisor, which is particularly affected by the degree of trust that the supervisor places in the autonomous system. Absent from the literature are models of supervisor trust dynamics that can accommodate asymmetric responses to autonomous system performance and the intermittent nature of supervisor-autonomous system communication. This paper focuses on formulating an estimated model of supervisor trust that incorporates both of these features by employing a switched linear system structure with event-triggered sampling of the model input and output. Trust response data collected in a user study with 51 participants were then used identify parameters for a switched linear model-based observer of supervisor trust.

Title: DiTSinger: Scaling Singing Voice Synthesis with Diffusion Transformer and Implicit Alignment
Authors: Zongcai Du, Guilin Deng, Xiaofeng Guo, Xin Gao, Linke Li, Kaichang Cheng, Fubo Han, Siyu Yang, Peng Liu, Pan Zhong, Qiang Fu
Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion-based Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) demonstrates strong expressiveness but remains limited by data scarcity and model scalability. We introduce a two-stage pipeline: a compact seed set of human-sung recordings is constructed by pairing fixed melodies with diverse LLM-generated lyrics, and melody-specific models are trained to synthesize over 500 hours of high-quality Chinese singing data. Building on this corpus, we propose DiTSinger, a Diffusion Transformer with RoPE and qk-norm, systematically scaled in depth, width, and resolution for enhanced fidelity. Furthermore, we design an implicit alignment mechanism that obviates phoneme-level duration labels by constraining phoneme-to-acoustic attention within character-level spans, thereby improving robustness under noisy or uncertain alignments. Extensive experiments validate that our approach enables scalable, alignment-free, and high-fidelity SVS.

Title: Déréverbération non-supervisée de la parole par modèle hybride
Authors: Louis Bahrman (IDS, S2A), Mathieu Fontaine (IDS, S2A), Gaël Richard (IDS, S2A)
Abstract: This paper introduces a new training strategy to improve speech dereverberation systems in an unsupervised manner using only reverberant speech. Most existing algorithms rely on paired dry/reverberant data, which is difficult to obtain. Our approach uses limited acoustic information, like the reverberation time (RT60), to train a dereverberation system. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves more consistent performance across various objective metrics than the state-of-the-art.

Title: O_O-VC: Synthetic Data-Driven One-to-One Alignment for Any-to-Any Voice Conversion
Authors: Huu Tuong Tu, Huan Vu, cuong tien nguyen, Dien Hy Ngo, Nguyen Thi Thu Trang
Abstract: Traditional voice conversion (VC) methods typically attempt to separate speaker identity and linguistic information into distinct representations, which are then combined to reconstruct the audio. However, effectively disentangling these factors remains challenging, often leading to information loss during training. In this paper, we propose a new approach that leverages synthetic speech data generated by a high-quality, pretrained multispeaker text-to-speech (TTS) model. Specifically, synthetic data pairs that share the same linguistic content but differ in speaker identity are used as input-output pairs to train the voice conversion model. This enables the model to learn a direct mapping between source and target voices, effectively capturing speaker-specific characteristics while preserving linguistic content. Additionally, we introduce a flexible training strategy for any-to-any voice conversion that generalizes well to unseen speakers and new languages, enhancing adaptability and performance in zero-shot scenarios. Our experiments show that our proposed method achieves a 16.35% relative reduction in word error rate and a 5.91% improvement in speaker cosine similarity, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods.

Title: MMAudioSep: Taming Video-to-Audio Generative Model Towards Video/Text-Queried Sound Separation
Authors: Akira Takahashi, Shusuke Takahashi, Yuki Mitsufuji
Abstract: We introduce MMAudioSep, a generative model for video/text-queried sound separation that is founded on a pretrained video-to-audio model. By leveraging knowledge about the relationship between video/text and audio learned through a pretrained audio generative model, we can train the model more efficiently, i.e., the model does not need to be trained from scratch. We evaluate the performance of MMAudioSep by comparing it to existing separation models, including models based on both deterministic and generative approaches, and find it is superior to the baseline models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that even after acquiring functionality for sound separation via fine-tuning, the model retains the ability for original video-to-audio generation. This highlights the potential of foundational sound generation models to be adopted for sound-related downstream tasks. Our code is available at this https URL.

Title: FLToP CTC: Frame-Level Token Pruning via Relative Threshold for Efficient and Memory-Saving Decoding on Diverse Platforms
Authors: Atul Shree, Harshith Jupuru
Abstract: CTC-based ASR systems face computational and memory bottlenecks in resource-limited environments. Traditional CTC decoders, requiring up to 90% of processing time in systems (e.g., wav2vec2-large on L4 GPUs), face inefficiencies due to exhaustive token-level operations. This paper introduces Frame Level Token Pruning for Connectionist Temporal Classification (FLToP CTC), a novel decoding algorithm that employs frame-level token pruning guided by a relative threshold probability. By dynamically eliminating low-probability tokens per frame, FLToP CTC reduces compute and memory demands while maintaining negligible WER degradation. On LibriSpeech, FLToP CTC achieves a 10.5x runtime speedup and 2.78x memory reduction versus standard CTC decoders. Its simplicity enables seamless integration into CTC decoders across platforms (CPUs, GPUs, etc.). FLToP CTC addresses CTC bottlenecks, offering scalability for resource-limited environments and realtime applications, enhancing speech recognition accessibility and efficiency.

Title: 3D Reconstruction from Transient Measurements with Time-Resolved Transformer
Authors: Yue Li, Shida Sun, Yu Hong, Feihu Xu, Zhiwei Xiong
Abstract: Transient measurements, captured by the timeresolved systems, are widely employed in photon-efficient reconstruction tasks, including line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging. However, challenges persist in their 3D reconstruction due to the low quantum efficiency of sensors and the high noise levels, particularly for long-range or complex scenes. To boost the 3D reconstruction performance in photon-efficient imaging, we propose a generic Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture. Different from existing transformers designed for high-dimensional data, TRT has two elaborate attention designs tailored for the spatio-temporal transient measurements. Specifically, the spatio-temporal self-attention encoders explore both local and global correlations within transient data by splitting or downsampling input features into different scales. Then, the spatio-temporal cross attention decoders integrate the local and global features in the token space, resulting in deep features with high representation capabilities. Building on TRT, we develop two task-specific embodiments: TRT-LOS for LOS imaging and TRT-NLOS for NLOS imaging. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both embodiments significantly outperform existing methods on synthetic data and real-world data captured by different imaging systems. In addition, we contribute a large-scale, high-resolution synthetic LOS dataset with various noise levels and capture a set of real-world NLOS measurements using a custom-built imaging system, enhancing the data diversity in this field.

Title: A Hybrid I/O Relation Estimation Scheme for Zak-OTFS Receivers
Authors: Sai Pradeep Muppaneni, Vineetha Yogesh, A. Chockalingam
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the delay-Doppler (DD) domain input-output (I/O) relation in Zak-OTFS modulation, which is needed for signal detection. Two approaches, namely, model-dependent and model-free approaches, can be employed for this purpose. The model-dependent approach requires explicit estimation of the physical channel parameters (path delays, Dopplers, and gains) to obtain the I/O relation. Such an explicit estimation is not required in the model-free approach, where the I/O relation can be estimated by reading off the samples in the fundamental DD period of the received pilot frame. Model-free approach has the advantage of acquiring fractional DD channels with simplicity. However, the read-off in the model-free approach provides an estimate of the effective channel only over a limited region in the DD plane but it does not provide an estimate for the region outside, and this can affect the estimation performance depending on the pulse shaping characteristics of the DD pulse shaping filter used. A poorly localized DD pulse shape leads to an increased degradation in performance. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a novel, yet simple, I/O relation estimation scheme that alleviates the above issue in the model-free approach. We achieve this by obtaining a coarse estimate of the effective channel outside the model-free estimation region using a novel model-dependent scheme and using this estimate along with the model-free estimate to obtain an improved estimate of the overall I/O relation. We devise the proposed estimation scheme for both exclusive and embedded pilot frames. Our simulation results using Vehicular-A, TDL-A and TDL-C channel models with fractional DDs show that the proposed hybrid estimation approach achieves superior performance compared to the pure model-free approach.

Title: Serial Polar Automorphism Ensemble Decoders for Physical Unclonable Functions
Authors: Marvin Rübenacke, Sebastian Cammerer, Michael Sullivan, Alexander Keller
Abstract: Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) involve challenging practical applications of error-correcting codes (ECCs), requiring extremely low failure rates on the order of $10^{-6}$ and below despite raw input bit error rates as high as 22%. These requirements call for an efficient ultra-low rate code design. In this work, we propose a novel coding scheme tailored for PUFs based on Polar codes and a low-complexity version of automorphism ensemble decoding (AED). Notably, our serial AED scheme reuses a single successive cancellation (SC) decoder across multiple decoding attempts. By introducing cascaded and recursive interleavers, we efficiently scale the number of AED candidates without requiring expensive large multiplexers. An aggressive quantization strategy of only 3 bits per message further reduces the area requirements of the underlying SC decoder. The resulting coding scheme achieves the same block error rate of $10^{-6}$ as our baseline based on Bose-Ray-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes while requiring 1.75x fewer codeword bits to encode the same K = 312 payload bits. This reduction translates directly into 1.75x less helper data storage and, consequently, a smaller overall chip area.

Title: Foraging with the Eyes: Dynamics in Human Visual Gaze and Deep Predictive Modeling
Authors: Tejaswi V. Panchagnula
Abstract: Animals often forage via Levy walks stochastic trajectories with heavy tailed step lengths optimized for sparse resource environments. We show that human visual gaze follows similar dynamics when scanning images. While traditional models emphasize image based saliency, the underlying spatiotemporal statistics of eye movements remain underexplored. Understanding these dynamics has broad applications in attention modeling and vision-based interfaces. In this study, we conducted a large scale human subject experiment involving 40 participants viewing 50 diverse images under unconstrained conditions, recording over 4 million gaze points using a high speed eye tracker. Analysis of these data shows that the gaze trajectory of the human eye also follows a Levy walk akin to animal foraging. This suggests that the human eye forages for visual information in an optimally efficient manner. Further, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict fixation heatmaps from image input alone. The model accurately reproduced salient fixation regions across novel images, demonstrating that key components of gaze behavior are learnable from visual structure alone. Our findings present new evidence that human visual exploration obeys statistical laws analogous to natural foraging and open avenues for modeling gaze through generative and predictive frameworks.

Title: Metaplectic time-frequency representations
Authors: Gianluca Giacchi
Abstract: Time-frequency representations stemmed in 1932 with the introduction of the Wigner distribution. For most of the 20th century, research in this area primarily focused on defining joint probability distributions for position and momentum in quantum mechanics. Applications to electrical engineering were soon established with the seminal works of Gabor and the researchers at Bell Labs. In 2012, Bai, Li and Cheng used for the first time metaplectic operators, defined in the middle of 20th century by Van Hove, to generalize the Wigner distribution and unify effectively the most used time-frequency representations under a common framework. This work serves as a comprehensive up-to-date survey on time-frequency representations defined by means of metaplectic operators, with particular emphasis on the recent contributions by Cordero and Rodino, who exploited metaplectic operators to their limits to generalize the Wigner distributions. Their idea provides a fruitful framework where properties of time-frequency representations can be explained naturally by the structure of the symplectic group.

Title: Task-Level Insights from Eigenvalues across Sequence Models
Authors: Rahel Rickenbach, Jelena Trisovic, Alexandre Didier, Jerome Sieber, Melanie N. Zeilinger
Abstract: Although softmax attention drives state-of-the-art performance for sequence models, its quadratic complexity limits scalability, motivating linear alternatives such as state space models (SSMs). While these alternatives improve efficiency, their fundamental differences in information processing remain poorly understood. In this work, we leverage the recently proposed dynamical systems framework to represent softmax, norm and linear attention as dynamical systems, enabling a structured comparison with SSMs by analyzing their respective eigenvalue spectra. Since eigenvalues capture essential aspects of dynamical system behavior, we conduct an extensive empirical analysis across diverse sequence models and benchmarks. We first show that eigenvalues influence essential aspects of memory and long-range dependency modeling, revealing spectral signatures that align with task requirements. Building on these insights, we then investigate how architectural modifications in sequence models impact both eigenvalue spectra and task performance. This correspondence further strengthens the position of eigenvalue analysis as a principled metric for interpreting, understanding, and ultimately improving the capabilities of sequence models.

Title: The Speech-LLM Takes It All: A Truly Fully End-to-End Spoken Dialogue State Tracking Approach
Authors: Nizar El Ghazal, Antoine Caubrière, Valentin Vielzeuf
Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study of context management strategies for end-to-end Spoken Dialog State Tracking using Speech-LLMs. We systematically evaluate traditional multimodal context (combining text history and spoken current turn), full spoken history, and compressed spoken history approaches. Our experiments on the SpokenWOZ corpus demonstrate that providing the full spoken conversation as input yields the highest performance among models of similar size, significantly surpassing prior methods. Furthermore, we show that attention-pooling-based compression of the spoken history offers a strong trade-off, maintaining competitive accuracy with reduced context size. Detailed analysis confirms that improvements stem from more effective context utilization.

Title: Demystifying and Navigating AI Ethics in Power Electronics
Authors: Fanfan Lin, Peter Wilson, Xinze Li, Alan Mantooth
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming power electronics, with AI-related publications in IEEE Power Electronics Society selected journals increasing more than fourfold from 2020 to 2025. However, the ethical dimensions of this transformation have received limited attention. This article underscores the urgent need for an ethical framework to guide responsible AI integration in power electronics, not only to prevent AI-related incidents but also to comply with legal and regulatory responsibilities. In this context, this article identifies four core pillars of AI ethics in power electronics: Security & Safety, Explainability & Transparency, Energy Sustainability, and Evolving Roles of Engineers. Each pillar is supported by practical and actionable insights to ensure that ethical principles are embedded in algorithm design, system deployment, and workforce development. The authors advocate for power electronics engineers to lead the ethical discourse, given their deep technical understanding of both AI systems and power conversion technologies. The paper concludes by calling on the IEEE Power Electronics Society to spearhead the establishment of ethical standards and best practices that ensure AI innovations are not only technically advanced but also trustworthy, safe, and sustainable.

Title: Precoder Design in Multi-User FDD Systems with VQ-VAE and GNN
Authors: Srikar Allaparapu, Michael Baur, Benedikt Böck, Michael Joham, Wolfgang Utschick
Abstract: Robust precoding is efficiently feasible in frequency division duplex (FDD) systems by incorporating the learnt statistics of the propagation environment through a generative model. We build on previous work that successfully designed site-specific precoders based on a combination of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). In this paper, by utilizing a vector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE), we circumvent one of the key drawbacks of GMMs, i.e., the number of GMM components scales exponentially to the feedback bits. In addition, the deep learning architecture of the VQ-VAE allows us to jointly train the GNN together with VQ-VAE along with pilot optimization forming an end-to-end (E2E) model, resulting in considerable performance gains in sum rate for multi-user wireless systems. Simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed frameworks over the conventional methods involving the sub-discrete Fourier transform (DFT) pilot matrix and iterative precoder algorithms enabling the deployment of systems characterized by fewer pilots or feedback bits.

Title: Accent-Invariant Automatic Speech Recognition via Saliency-Driven Spectrogram Masking
Authors: Mohammad Hossein Sameti, Sepehr Harfi Moridani, Ali Zarean, Hossein Sameti
Abstract: Pre-trained transformer-based models have significantly advanced automatic speech recognition (ASR), yet they remain sensitive to accent and dialectal variations, resulting in elevated word error rates (WER) in linguistically diverse languages such as English and Persian. To address this challenge, we propose an accent-invariant ASR framework that integrates accent and dialect classification into the recognition pipeline. Our approach involves training a spectrogram-based classifier to capture accent-specific cues, masking the regions most influential to its predictions, and using the masked spectrograms for data augmentation. This enhances the robustness of ASR models against accent variability. We evaluate the method using both English and Persian speech. For Persian, we introduce a newly collected dataset spanning multiple regional accents, establishing the first systematic benchmark for accent variation in Persian ASR that fills a critical gap in multilingual speech research and provides a foundation for future studies on low-resource, linguistically diverse languages. Experimental results with the Whisper model demonstrate that our masking and augmentation strategy yields substantial WER reductions in both English and Persian settings, confirming the effectiveness of the approach. This research advances the development of multilingual ASR systems that are resilient to accent and dialect diversity. Code and dataset are publicly available at: this https URL

Title: Observability for Nonlinear Systems: Connecting Variational Dynamics, Lyapunov Exponents, and Empirical Gramians
Authors: Mohamad H. Kazma, Ahmad F. Taha
Abstract: Observability quantification is a key problem in dynamic network sciences. While it has been thoroughly studied for linear systems, observability quantification for nonlinear networks is less intuitive and more cumbersome. One common approach to quantify observability for nonlinear systems is via the Empirical Gramian (Empr-Gram) -- a generalized form of the Gramian of linear systems. In this paper, we produce three new results. First, we establish that a variational form of discrete-time autonomous nonlinear systems yields a so-called Variational Gramian (Var-Gram) that is equivalent to the classic Empr-Gram; the former being easier to compute than the latter. Via Lyapunov exponents derived from Lyapunov's direct method, the paper's second result derives connections between existing observability measures and Var-Gram. The third result demonstrates the applicability of these new notions for sensor selection/placement in nonlinear systems. Numerical case studies demonstrate these three developments and their merits.

Title: SolNet: Open-source deep learning models for photovoltaic power forecasting across the globe
Authors: Joris Depoortere, Johan Driesen, Johan Suykens, Hussain Syed Kazmi
Abstract: Deep learning models have gained increasing prominence in recent years in the field of solar pho-tovoltaic (PV) forecasting. One drawback of these models is that they require a lot of high-quality data to perform well. This is often infeasible in practice, due to poor measurement infrastructure in legacy systems and the rapid build-up of new solar systems across the world. This paper proposes SolNet: a novel, general-purpose, multivariate solar power forecaster, which addresses these challenges by using a two-step forecasting pipeline which incorporates transfer learning from abundant synthetic data generated from PVGIS, before fine-tuning on observational data. Using actual production data from hundreds of sites in the Netherlands, Australia and Belgium, we show that SolNet improves forecasting performance over data-scarce settings as well as baseline models. We find transfer learning benefits to be the strongest when only limited observational data is available. At the same time we provide several guidelines and considerations for transfer learning practitioners, as our results show that weather data, seasonal patterns, amount of synthetic data and possible mis-specification in source location, can have a major impact on the results. The SolNet models created in this way are applicable for any land-based solar photovoltaic system across the planet where simulated and observed data can be combined to obtain improved forecasting capabilities.

Title: Frequency-Guided Posterior Sampling for Diffusion-Based Image Restoration
Authors: Darshan Thaker, Abhishek Goyal, René Vidal
Abstract: Image restoration aims to recover high-quality images from degraded observations. When the degradation process is known, the recovery problem can be formulated as an inverse problem, and in a Bayesian context, the goal is to sample a clean reconstruction given the degraded observation. Recently, modern pretrained diffusion models have been used for image restoration by modifying their sampling procedure to account for the degradation process. However, these methods often rely on certain approximations that can lead to significant errors and compromised sample quality. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous analysis of this approximation error for linear inverse problems under distributional assumptions on the space of natural images, demonstrating cases where previous works can fail dramatically. Motivated by our theoretical insights, we propose a simple modification to existing diffusion-based restoration methods. Our approach introduces a time-varying low-pass filter in the frequency domain of the measurements, progressively incorporating higher frequencies during the restoration process. We develop an adaptive curriculum for this frequency schedule based on the underlying data distribution. Our method significantly improves performance on challenging image restoration tasks including motion deblurring and image dehazing.

Title: Cramér-Rao Bound Optimization for Near-Field Sensing with Continuous-Aperture Arrays
Authors: Hao Jiang, Zhaolin Wang, Yuanwei Liu, Arumugam Nallanathan
Abstract: A Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) optimization framework for near-field sensing (NISE) with continuous-aperture arrays (CAPAs) is proposed. In contrast to conventional spatially discrete arrays (SPDAs), CAPAs emit electromagnetic (EM) probing signals through continuous source currents for target sensing, thereby exploiting the full spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). The maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method for estimating target locations in the near-field region is developed. To evaluate the NISE performance with CAPAs, the CRB for estimating target locations is derived based on continuous transmit and receive array responses of CAPAs. Subsequently, a CRB minimization problem is formulated to optimize the continuous source current of CAPAs. This results in a non-convex, integral-based functional optimization problem. To address this challenge, the optimal structure of the source current is derived and proven to be spanned by a series of basis functions determined by the system geometry. To solve the CRB minimization problem, a low-complexity subspace manifold gradient descent (SMGD) method is proposed, leveraging the derived optimal structure of the source current. Our simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed SMGD method and further demonstrate that i)~the proposed SMGD method can effectively solve the CRB minimization problem with reduced computational complexity, and ii)~CAPA achieves a tenfold improvement in sensing performance compared to its SPDA counterpart, due to full exploitation of spatial DoFs.

Title: Convergent Primal-Dual Plug-and-Play Image Restoration: A General Algorithm and Applications
Authors: Yodai Suzuki, Ryosuke Isono, Shunsuke Ono
Abstract: We propose a general deep plug-and-play (PnP) algorithm with a theoretical convergence guarantee. PnP strategies have demonstrated outstanding performance in various image restoration tasks by exploiting the powerful priors underlying Gaussian denoisers. However, existing PnP methods often lack theoretical convergence guarantees under realistic assumptions due to their ad-hoc nature, resulting in inconsistent behavior. Moreover, even when convergence guarantees are provided, they are typically designed for specific settings or require a considerable computational cost in handling non-quadratic data-fidelity terms and additional constraints, which are key components in many image restoration scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we integrate the PnP paradigm with primal-dual splitting (PDS), an efficient proximal splitting methodology for solving a wide range of convex optimization problems, and develop a general convergent PnP framework. Specifically, we establish theoretical conditions for the convergence of the proposed PnP algorithm under a reasonable assumption. Furthermore, we show that the problem solved by the proposed PnP algorithm is not a standard convex optimization problem but a more general monotone inclusion problem, where we provide a mathematical representation of the solution set. Our approach efficiently handles a broad class of image restoration problems with guaranteed theoretical convergence. Numerical experiments on specific image restoration tasks validate the practicality and effectiveness of our theoretical results.

Title: Coordinated Control of Deformation and Flight for Morphing Aircraft via Meta-Learning and Coupled State-Dependent Riccati Equations
Authors: Hao-Chi Che, Huai-Ning Wu
Abstract: In this paper, the coordinated control problem of deformation and flight for morphing aircraft (MA) is studied by using meta-learning (ML) and coupled state-dependent Riccati equations (CSDREs). Our method is built on two principal observations that dynamic models of MA under varying morphing conditions share a morphing condition independent representation function and that the specific morphing condition part lies in a set of linear coefficients. To that end, the domain adversarially invariant meta-learning (DAIML) is employed to learn the shared representation with offline flight data. Based on the learned representation function, the coordinated control of the deformation and flight for MA is formulated as a non-cooperative differential game. The state-dependent feedback control solutions can be derived by addressing a pair of CSDREs. For this purpose, Lyapunov iterations are extended to obtain the positive semidefinite (definite) stabilizing solutions of the CSDREs, and the convergence proof of the proposed algorithm is provided. Finally, a simulation study is carried out to validate the efficacy of the developed coordinated game control strategies.

Title: A view on learning robust goal-conditioned value functions: Interplay between RL and MPC
Authors: Nathan P. Lawrence, Philip D. Loewen, Michael G. Forbes, R. Bhushan Gopaluni, Ali Mesbah
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) and model predictive control (MPC) offer a wealth of distinct approaches for automatic decision-making under uncertainty. Given the impact both fields have had independently across numerous domains, there is growing interest in combining the general-purpose learning capability of RL with the safety and robustness features of MPC. To this end, this paper presents a tutorial-style treatment of RL and MPC, treating them as alternative approaches to solving Markov decision processes. In our formulation, RL aims to learn a global value function through offline exploration in an uncertain environment, whereas MPC constructs a local value function through online optimization. This local-global perspective suggests new ways to design policies that combine robustness and goal-conditioned learning. Robustness is incorporated into the RL and MPC pipelines through a scenario-based approach. Goal-conditioned learning aims to alleviate the burden of engineering a reward function for RL. Combining the two leads to a single policy that unites a robust, high-level RL terminal value function with short-term, scenario-based MPC planning for reliable constraint satisfaction. This approach leverages the benefits of both RL and MPC, the effectiveness of which is demonstrated on classical control benchmarks.

Title: Limited-Resolution Hybrid Analog-Digital Precoding Design Using MIMO Detection Methods
Authors: Parisa Ramezani, Alva Kosasih, Emil Björnson
Abstract: While fully-digital precoding achieves superior performance in massive MIMO systems, it comes with significant drawbacks in terms of computational complexity and power consumption, particularly when operating at millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies and beyond. Hybrid analog-digital architectures address this by reducing radio frequency (RF) chains while maintaining performance in sparse multipath environments. However, most hybrid precoder designs assume ideal, infinite-resolution analog phase shifters, which cannot be implemented in real systems. Another practical constraint is the limited fronthaul capacity between the baseband processor and array, implying that each entry of the digital precoder must be picked from a finite set of quantization labels. This paper proposes novel designs for the limited-resolution analog and digital precoders by exploiting two well-known MIMO symbol detection algorithms, namely sphere decoding (SD) and expectation propagation (EP). Unlike prior works that rely on heuristic or sub-optimal designs for the low-resolution hybrid precoder, the proposed transformative MIMO detection-inspired designs are able to achieve optimal and near-optimal solutions. The main objective is to minimize the Euclidean distance between the optimal fully-digital precoder and the hybrid precoder to minimize the degradation caused by the finite resolution of the analog and digital precoders. Taking an alternating optimization approach, we first apply the SD method to find the precoders in each iteration optimally. Then, we apply the lower-complexity EP method which finds a near-optimal solution at a reduced computational cost. The effectiveness of the proposed designs is validated through extensive numerical simulations, which demonstrate that both SD-based and EP-based hybrid precoding schemes significantly outperform widely-used sub-optimal approaches.

Title: EMedNeXt: An Enhanced Brain Tumor Segmentation Framework for Sub-Saharan Africa using MedNeXt V2 with Deep Supervision
Authors: Ahmed Jaheen, Abdelrahman Elsayed, Damir Kim, Daniil Tikhonov, Matheus Scatolin, Mohor Banerjee, Qiankun Ji, Mostafa Salem, Hu Wang, Sarim Hashmi, Mohammad Yaqub
Abstract: Brain cancer affects millions worldwide, and in nearly every clinical setting, doctors rely on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose and monitor gliomas. However, the current standard for tumor quantification through manual segmentation of multi-parametric MRI is time-consuming, requires expert radiologists, and is often infeasible in under-resourced healthcare systems. This problem is especially pronounced in low-income regions, where MRI scanners are of lower quality and radiology expertise is scarce, leading to incorrect segmentation and quantification. In addition, the number of acquired MRI scans in Africa is typically small. To address these challenges, the BraTS-Lighthouse 2025 Challenge focuses on robust tumor segmentation in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where resource constraints and image quality degradation introduce significant shifts. In this study, we present EMedNeXt -- an enhanced brain tumor segmentation framework based on MedNeXt V2 with deep supervision and optimized post-processing pipelines tailored for SSA. EMedNeXt introduces three key contributions: a larger region of interest, an improved nnU-Net v2-based architectural skeleton, and a robust model ensembling system. Evaluated on the hidden validation set, our solution achieved an average LesionWise DSC of 0.897 with an average LesionWise NSD of 0.541 and 0.84 at a tolerance of 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm, respectively.

Title: Modeling and Simulation of an Active Car Suspension with a Robust LQR Controller under Road Disturbance, Parameter Uncertainty and White Noise
Authors: Mehmet Karahan
Abstract: Vehicle suspension is important for passengers to travel comfortably and to be less exposed to effects such as vibration and shock. A good suspension system increases the road holding of vehicles, allows them to take turns safely, and reduces the risk of traffic accidents. A passive suspension system is the most widely used suspension system in vehicles due to its simple structure and low cost. Passive suspension systems do not have an actuator and therefore do not have a controller. Active suspension systems have an actuator and a controller. Although their structures are more complex and costly, they are safer. PID controller is widely used in active suspension systems due to its simple structure, reasonable cost, and easy adjustment of coefficients. In this study, a more robust LQR-controlled active suspension was designed than a passive suspension and a PID-controlled active suspension. Robustness analyses were performed for passive suspension, PID-controlled active suspension, and LQR-controlled active suspension. Suspension travel, sprung mass acceleration, and sprung mass motion simulations were performed for all three suspensions under road disturbance, under simultaneous road disturbance and parameter uncertainty and under road disturbance with white noise. A comparative analysis was performed by obtaining the rise time, overshoot, and settling time data of the suspensions under different conditions. It was observed that the LQR-controlled active suspension showed the fastest rise time, the least overshoot and had the shortest settling time. In this case, it was proven that the LQR controlled active suspension provided a more comfortable and safe ride compared to the other two suspension systems.

Title: Forecasting Self-Similar User Traffic Demand Using Transformers in LEO Satellite Networks
Authors: Yekta Demirci, Guillaume Mantelet, Stéphane Martel, Jean-François Frigon, Gunes Karabulut Kurt
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the use of a transformer-based model to address the need for forecasting user traffic demand in the next generation Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks. Considering a LEO satellite constellation, we present the need to forecast the demand for the satellites in-orbit to utilize dynamic beam-hopping in high granularity. We adopt a traffic dataset with second-order self-similar characteristics. Given this traffic dataset, the Fractional Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average (FARIMA) model is considered a benchmark forecasting solution. However, the constrained on-board processing capabilities of LEO satellites, combined with the need to fit a new model for each input sequence due to the nature of FARIMA, motivate the investigation of alternative solutions. As an alternative, a pretrained probabilistic time series model that utilizes transformers with a Prob-Sparse self-attention mechanism is considered. The considered solution is investigated under different time granularities with varying sequence and prediction lengths. Concluding this paper, we provide extensive simulation results where the transformer-based solution achieved up to six percent better forecasting accuracy on certain traffic conditions using mean squared error as the performance indicator.

Title: Frequency-Aware Ensemble Learning for BraTS 2025 Pediatric Brain Tumor Segmentation
Authors: Yuxiao Yi, Qingyao Zhuang, Zhi-Qin John Xu, Xiaowen Wang, Yan Ren, Tianming Qiu
Abstract: Pediatric brain tumor segmentation presents unique challenges due to the rarity and heterogeneity of these malignancies, yet remains critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. We propose an ensemble approach integrating nnU-Net, Swin UNETR, and HFF-Net for the BraTS-PED 2025 challenge. Our method incorporates three key extensions: adjustable initialization scales for optimal nnU-Net complexity control, transfer learning from BraTS 2021 pre-trained models to enhance Swin UNETR's generalization on pediatric dataset, and frequency domain decomposition for HFF-Net to separate low-frequency tissue contours from high-frequency texture details. Our final ensemble framework combines nnU-Net ($\gamma=0.7$), fine-tuned Swin UNETR, and HFF-Net, achieving Dice scores of 62.7% (CC), 83.2% (ED), 72.9% (ET), 85.7% (NET), 91.8% (TC), and 92.6% (WT) on the unseen test dataset, respectively. Our proposed method achieves first place (rank 1st) in the BraTS 2025 Pediatric Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge.

Title: Hierarchical Analysis and Control of Epidemic Spreading over Networks using Dissipativity and Mesh Stability
Authors: Shirantha Welikala, Hai Lin, Panos J. Antsaklis
Abstract: Analyzing and controlling spreading processes are challenging problems due to the involved non-linear node (subsystem) dynamics, unknown disturbances, complex interconnections, and the large-scale and multi-level nature of the problems. The dissipativity concept provides a practical framework for addressing such concerns, thanks to the energy-based representation it offers for subsystems and the compositional properties it provides for the analysis and control of interconnected (networked) systems comprised of such subsystems. Therefore, in this paper, we utilize the dissipativity concept to analyze and control a spreading process that occurs over a hierarchy of nodes, groups, and a network (i.e., a spreading network). We start by generalizing several existing results on dissipativity-based topology design for networked systems. Next, we model the considered spreading network as a networked system and establish the dissipativity properties of its nodes. The generalized topology design method is then applied at multiple levels of the considered spreading network to formulate its analysis and control problems as Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problems. We identify and enforce localized necessary conditions to support the feasibility of the LMI problem solved at each subsequent hierarchical level of the spreading network. Consequently, the proposed method does not involve iterative multi-level optimization stages that are computationally inefficient. The proposed control solution ensures that the spreading network is not only stable but also dissipative and mesh-stable. Compared to conventional methods, such as threshold pruning and high-degree edge removal, our approach offers superior performance in terms of infection containment, control efficiency, and disturbance robustness. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

Title: Learning a Shape-adaptive Assist-as-needed Rehabilitation Policy from Therapist-informed Input
Authors: Zhimin Hou, Jiacheng Hou, Xiao Chen, Hamid Sadeghian, Tianyu Ren, Sami Haddadin
Abstract: Therapist-in-the-loop robotic rehabilitation has shown great promise in enhancing rehabilitation outcomes by integrating the strengths of therapists and robotic systems. However, its broader adoption remains limited due to insufficient safe interaction and limited adaptation capability. This article proposes a novel telerobotics-mediated framework that enables therapists to intuitively and safely deliver assist-as-needed~(AAN) therapy based on two primary contributions. First, our framework encodes the therapist-informed corrective force into via-points in a latent space, allowing the therapist to provide only minimal assistance while encouraging patient maintaining own motion preferences. Second, a shape-adaptive ANN rehabilitation policy is learned to partially and progressively deform the reference trajectory for movement therapy based on encoded patient motion preferences and therapist-informed via-points. The effectiveness of the proposed shape-adaptive AAN strategy was validated on a telerobotic rehabilitation system using two representative tasks. The results demonstrate its practicality for remote AAN therapy and its superiority over two state-of-the-art methods in reducing corrective force and improving movement smoothness.

Title: Resilient Multi-Dimensional Consensus and Distributed Optimization against Agent-Based and Denial-of-Service Attacks
Authors: Hongjian Chen, Changyun Wen, Xiaolei Li
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the resilient multi-dimensional consensus and distributed optimization problems of multi-agent systems (MASs) in the presence of both agent-based and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The considered agent-based attacks can cover malicious, Byzantine, and stubborn agents. The links between agents in the network can be blocked by DoS attacks, which may lead the digraph to be time-varying and even disconnected. The objective is to ensure that the remaining benign agents achieve consensus. To this end, an "auxiliary point"-based resilient control algorithm is proposed for MASs. Under the proposed algorithm, each healthy agent constructs a "safe kernel" utilizing the states of its in-neighbors and updates its state toward a specific point within this kernel at each iteration. If an agent cannot receive its neighbors' states owing to DoS attacks, it will use the states received immediately before the DoS period. Moreover, a resilient multi-dimensional distributed optimization (RMDO) algorithm is also proposed. Theoretical proofs and numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

Title: Decentralized CBF-based Safety Filters for Collision Avoidance of Cooperative Missile Systems with Input Constraints
Authors: Johannes Autenrieb, Mark Spiller
Abstract: This paper presents a decentralized safety filter for collision avoidance in multi-agent aerospace interception scenarios. The approach leverages robust control barrier functions (RCBFs) to guarantee forward invariance of safety sets under bounded inputs and high-relative-degree dynamics. Each effector executes its nominal cooperative guidance command, while a local quadratic program (QP) modifies the input only when necessary. Event-triggered activation based on range and zero-effort miss (ZEM) criteria ensures scalability by restricting active constraints to relevant neighbors. To resolve feasibility issues from simultaneous constraints, a slack-variable relaxation scheme is introduced that prioritizes critical agents in a Pareto-optimal manner. Simulation results in many-on-many interception scenarios demonstrate that the proposed framework maintains collision-free operation with minimal deviation from nominal guidance, providing a computationally efficient and scalable solution for safety-critical multi-agent aerospace systems.

Title: Content-Adaptive Inference for State-of-the-art Learned Video Compression
Authors: Ahmet Bilican, M. Akın Yılmaz, A. Murat Tekalp
Abstract: While the BD-rate performance of recent learned video codec models in both low-delay and random-access modes exceed that of respective modes of traditional codecs on average over common benchmarks, the performance improvements for individual videos with complex/large motions is much smaller compared to scenes with simple motion. This is related to the inability of a learned encoder model to generalize to motion vector ranges that have not been seen in the training set, which causes loss of performance in both coding of flow fields as well as frame prediction and coding. As a remedy, we propose a generic (model-agnostic) framework to control the scale of motion vectors in a scene during inference (encoding) to approximately match the range of motion vectors in the test and training videos by adaptively downsampling frames. This results in down-scaled motion vectors enabling: i) better flow estimation; hence, frame prediction and ii) more efficient flow compression. We show that the proposed framework for content-adaptive inference improves the BD-rate performance of already state-of-the-art low-delay video codec DCVC-FM by up to 41\% on individual videos without any model fine tuning. We present ablation studies to show measures of motion and scene complexity can be used to predict the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Title: Techno-economic analysis of self-sustainable thermophotovoltaic systems for grid-scale energy generation
Authors: Jihun Lim, Sungwon Lee
Abstract: To facilitate the widespread adoption of renewable energy, dispatchable, zero-emission power sources are essential for grid stability. This work performs a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of a self-sustainable thermophotovoltaic (TPV) system, an architecture that integrates solar charging to function as a standalone power generation asset. Using theory-based models for conventional air-bridge InGaAs and Si diode cells, our analysis reveals that while the system is not currently competitive from a pure levelized of storage cost (LCOS) perspective due to the high capital expenditure for thermal battery materials, its primary value lies in its competitive levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), which is comparable to that of conventional dispatchable generators such as gas turbines. Furthermore, we show that a full Si-based TPV system, utilizing a 50-{\mu}m-thick air-bridge cell for enhanced photon utilization, can also achieve an LCOE that is competitive with such conventional power sources at scales exceeding the gigawatt-hour level, despite its lower conversion efficiency relative to its InGaAs counterpart. This highlights a practical engineering pathway for leveraging the immense manufacturing scalability of Si, offering a lower-risk route to deployment compared to III-V materials. Ultimately, this work establishes the self-sustainable TPV architecture as a compelling pathway toward providing grid-scale, on-demand, zero-emission power.

Title: Over-The-Air Phase Calibration of Spaceborne Phased Array for LEO Satellite Communications
Authors: Wei Zhang, Ding Chen, Bin Zhou
Abstract: To avoid the unpredictable phase deviations of the spaceborne phased array (SPA), this paper considers the over-the-air (OTA) phase calibration of the SPA for the low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications, where the phase deviations of the SPA and the unknown channel are jointly estimated with multiple transmissions of the pilots. Moreover, the Cramer Rao Bound (CRB) is derived, and the optimization of beam patterns is also presented to lower the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the OTA calibration. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed OTA phase calibration algorithm as the RMSEs of the phase estimates closely approach the corresponding CRB, and the beam pattern optimization scheme is also validated for more than 4dB gain of SNR over the randomly generated beam patterns.

Title: A Control Allocation Algorithm for Hypersonic Glide Vehicles with Input Limitations
Authors: Johannes Autenrieb, Patrick Gruhn
Abstract: Hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs) operate in challenging flight regimes characterized by strong nonlinearities in actuation and stringent physical constraints. These include state-dependent actuator limitations, asymmetric control bounds, and thermal loads that vary with maneuvering conditions. This paper introduces an iterative control allocation method to address these challenges in real time. The proposed algorithm searches for control inputs that achieve the desired moment commands while respecting constraints on input magnitude and rate. For slender HGV configurations, thermal loads and drag generation are strongly correlated-lower drag typically results in reduced surface heating. By embedding drag-sensitive soft constraints, the method improves energy efficiency and implicitly reduces surface temperatures, lowering the vehicle's infrared signature. These features are particularly advantageous for long-range military operations that require low observability. The approach is demonstrated using the DLR's Generic Hypersonic Glide Vehicle 2 (GHGV-2) simulation model. The results confirm the method's effectiveness in maintaining control authority under realistic, constrained flight conditions.

Authors: Salim Janji, Adam Samorzewski, Małgorzata Wasilewska, Adrian Kliks
Abstract: We consider free-space optical (FSO) communication links for the backhaul connectivity of small cells (SCs) where a UAV with an FSO apparatus can serve as a backhaul relay node. We demonstrate how such drone relay stations (DRSs) can be deployed in a high-rise urban area in order to provide FSO line-of-sight (LOS) links that are unobstructed by buildings. Also, in our solution we consider the case where solar panels are mounted on DRSs such that placing the DRS in a sunny location is prioritized, and we show the gain in terms of number of required trips to recharge the UAV.

Title: Energy-efficient User Clustering for UAV-enabled Wireless Networks Using EM Algorithm
Authors: Salim Janji, Adrian Kliks
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be used to provide wireless connectivity to support the existing infrastructure in hot-spots or replace it in cases of destruction. UAV-enabled wireless provides several advantages in network performance due to drone small cells (DSCs) mobility despite the limited onboard energy. However, the problem of resource allocation has added complexity. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient user clustering mechanism based on Gaussian mixture models (GMM) using a modified Expected-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The algorithm is intended to provide the initial user clustering and drone deployment upon which additional mechanisms can be employed to further enhance the system performance. The proposed algorithm improves the energy efficiency of the system by 25% and link reliability by 18.3% compared to other baseline methods.

Title: Multilinear analysis of quaternion arrays: theory and computation
Authors: Julien Flamant, Xavier Luciani, Sebastian Miron, Yassine Zniyed
Abstract: Multidimensional quaternion arrays (often referred to as "quaternion tensors") and their decompositions have recently gained increasing attention in various fields such as color and polarimetric imaging or video processing. Despite this growing interest, the theoretical development of quaternion tensors remains limited. This paper introduces a novel multilinear framework for quaternion arrays, which extends the classical tensor analysis to multidimensional quaternion data in a rigorous manner. Specifically, we propose a new definition of quaternion tensors as $\mathbb{H}\mathbb{R}$-multilinear forms, addressing the challenges posed by the non-commutativity of quaternion multiplication. Within this framework, we establish the Tucker decomposition for quaternion tensors and develop a quaternion Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (Q-CPD). We thoroughly investigate the properties of the Q-CPD, including trivial ambiguities, complex equivalent models, and sufficient conditions for uniqueness. Additionally, we present two algorithms for computing the Q-CPD and demonstrate their effectiveness through numerical experiments. Our results provide a solid theoretical foundation for further research on quaternion tensor decompositions and offer new computational tools for practitioners working with quaternion multiway data.

Title: SwarmGPT: Combining Large Language Models with Safe Motion Planning for Drone Swarm Choreography
Authors: Martin Schuck, Dinushka Orrin Dahanaggamaarachchi, Ben Sprenger, Vedant Vyas, Siqi Zhou, Angela P. Schoellig
Abstract: Drone swarm performances -- synchronized, expressive aerial displays set to music -- have emerged as a captivating application of modern robotics. Yet designing smooth, safe choreographies remains a complex task requiring expert knowledge. We present SwarmGPT, a language-based choreographer that leverages the reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) to streamline drone performance design. The LLM is augmented by a safety filter that ensures deployability by making minimal corrections when safety or feasibility constraints are violated. By decoupling high-level choreographic design from low-level motion planning, our system enables non-experts to iteratively refine choreographies using natural language without worrying about collisions or actuator limits. We validate our approach through simulations with swarms up to 200 drones and real-world experiments with up to 20 drones performing choreographies to diverse types of songs, demonstrating scalable, synchronized, and safe performances. Beyond entertainment, this work offers a blueprint for integrating foundation models into safety-critical swarm robotics applications.

Title: A Real-Time System for Scheduling and Managing UAV Delivery in Urban Areas
Authors: Han Liu, Tian Liu, Kai Huang
Abstract: As urban logistics demand continues to grow, UAV delivery has become a key solution to improve delivery efficiency, reduce traffic congestion, and lower logistics costs. However, to fully leverage the potential of UAV delivery networks, efficient swarm scheduling and management are crucial. In this paper, we propose a real-time scheduling and management system based on the ``Airport-Unloading Station" model, aiming to bridge the gap between high-level scheduling algorithms and low-level execution systems. This system, acting as middleware, accurately translates the requirements from the scheduling layer into specific execution instructions, ensuring that the scheduling algorithms perform effectively in real-world environments. Additionally, we implement three collaborative scheduling schemes involving autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and ground staff to further optimize overall delivery efficiency. Through extensive experiments, this study demonstrates the rationality and feasibility of the proposed management system, providing practical solution for the commercial application of UAVs delivery in urban.

Title: A Digital Twin for Diesel Engines: Operator-infused Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Transfer Learning for Engine Health Monitoring
Authors: Kamaljyoti Nath, Varun Kumar, Daniel J. Smith, George Em Karniadakis
Abstract: Improving diesel engine efficiency, reducing emissions, and enabling robust health monitoring have been critical research topics in engine modelling. While recent advancements in the use of neural networks for system monitoring have shown promising results, such methods often focus on component-level analysis, lack generalizability, and physical interpretability. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid framework that combines physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with deep operator networks (DeepONet) to enable accurate and computationally efficient parameter identification in mean-value diesel engine models. Our method leverages physics-based system knowledge in combination with data-driven training of neural networks to enhance model applicability. Incorporating offline-trained DeepONets to predict actuator dynamics significantly lowers the online computation cost when compared to the existing PINN framework. To address the re-training burden typical of PINNs under varying input conditions, we propose two transfer learning (TL) strategies: (i) a multi-stage TL scheme offering better runtime efficiency than full online training of the PINN model and (ii) a few-shot TL scheme that freezes a shared multi-head network body and computes physics-based derivatives required for model training outside the training loop. The second strategy offers a computationally inexpensive and physics-based approach for predicting engine dynamics and parameter identification, offering computational efficiency over the existing PINN framework. Compared to existing health monitoring methods, our framework combines the interpretability of physics-based models with the flexibility of deep learning, offering substantial gains in generalization, accuracy, and deployment efficiency for diesel engine diagnostics.

Title: Hybrid Feedback Control for Global Navigation with Locally Optimal Obstacle Avoidance in n-Dimensional Spaces
Authors: Ishak Cheniouni, Soulaimane Berkane, Abdelhamid Tayebi
Abstract: We present a hybrid feedback control framework for autonomous robot navigation in n-dimensional Euclidean spaces cluttered with spherical obstacles. The proposed approach ensures safe and global navigation towards a target location by dynamically switching between two operational modes: motion-to-destination and locally optimal obstacle-avoidance. It produces continuous velocity inputs, ensures collision-free trajectories and generates locally optimal obstacle avoidance maneuvers. Unlike existing methods, the proposed framework is compatible with range sensors, enabling navigation in both a priori known and unknown environments. Extensive simulations in 2D and 3D settings, complemented by experimental validation on a TurtleBot 4 platform, confirm the efficacy and robustness of the approach. Our results demonstrate shorter paths and smoother trajectories compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining computational efficiency and real-world feasibility.

Title: SQ-GAN: Semantic Image Communications Using Masked Vector Quantization
Authors: Francesco Pezone, Sergio Barbarossa, Giuseppe Caire
Abstract: This work introduces Semantically Masked Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (SQ-GAN), a novel approach integrating semantically driven image coding and vector quantization to optimize image compression for semantic/task-oriented communications. The method only acts on source coding and is fully compliant with legacy systems. The semantics is extracted from the image computing its semantic segmentation map using off-the-shelf software. A new specifically developed semantic-conditioned adaptive mask module (SAMM) selectively encodes semantically relevant features of the image. The relevance of the different semantic classes is task-specific, and it is incorporated in the training phase by introducing appropriate weights in the loss function. SQ-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art image compression schemes such as JPEG2000, BPG, and deep-learning based methods across multiple metrics, including perceptual quality and semantic segmentation accuracy on the reconstructed image, at extremely low compression rates.

Title: Extending First-order Robotic Motion Planners to Second-order Robot Dynamics
Authors: Mayur Sawant, Abdelhamid Tayebi
Abstract: This paper extends first-order motion planners to robots governed by second-order dynamics. Two control schemes are proposed based on the knowledge of a scalar function whose negative gradient aligns with a given first-order motion planner. When such a function is known, the first-order motion planner is combined with a damping velocity vector with a dynamic gain to extend the safety and convergence guarantees of the first-order motion planner to second-order systems. If no such function is available, we propose an alternative control scheme ensuring that the error between the robot's velocity and the first-order motion planner converges to zero. The theoretical developments are supported by simulation results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

Title: Safe Autonomous Environmental Contact for Soft Robots using Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Akua K. Dickson, Juan C. Pacheco Garcia, Meredith L. Anderson, Ran Jing, Sarah Alizadeh-Shabdiz, Audrey X. Wang, Charles DeLorey, Zach J. Patterson, Andrew P. Sabelhaus
Abstract: Robots built from soft materials will inherently apply lower environmental forces than their rigid counterparts, and therefore may be more suitable in sensitive settings with unintended contact. However, these robots' applied forces result from both their design and their control system in closed-loop, and therefore, ensuring bounds on these forces requires controller synthesis for safety as well. This article introduces the first feedback controller for a soft manipulator that formally meets a safety specification with respect to environmental contact. In our proof-of-concept setting, the robot's environment has known geometry and is deformable with a known elastic modulus. Our approach maps a bound on applied forces to a safe set of positions of the robot's tip via predicted deformations of the environment. Then, a quadratic program with Control Barrier Functions in its constraints is used to supervise a nominal feedback signal, verifiably maintaining the robot's tip within this safe set. Hardware experiments on a multi-segment soft pneumatic robot demonstrate that the proposed framework successfully maintains a positive safety margin. This framework represents a fundamental shift in perspective on control and safety for soft robots, implementing a formally verifiable logic specification on their pose and contact forces.

Title: Safe and Optimal N-Spacecraft Swarm Reconfiguration in Non-Keplerian Cislunar Orbits
Authors: Yuji Takubo, Walter Manuel, Ethan Foss, Simone D'Amico
Abstract: This paper presents a novel fuel-optimal guidance and control methodology for spacecraft swarm reconfiguration in Restricted Multi-Body Problems (RMBPs) with a guarantee of passive safety, maintaining miss distance even under abrupt loss of control authority. A new set of constraints exploits a quasi-periodic structure of RMBPs to guarantee passive safety. Particularly, the condition for passive safety is expressed as simple geometric constraints by solving optimal control in Local Toroidal Coordinates, which is based on a local eigenspace of a quasi-periodic motion around the corresponding periodic orbit. The proposed formulation enables a significant simplification of problem structure, which is applicable to large-scale swarm reconfiguration in cislunar orbits. The method is demonstrated in the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem, the Elliptic Restricted Three-Body Problem, and the Bi-Circular Restricted Four-Body Problem. Furthermore, the optimized control profiles are validated in the full-ephemeris dynamics model. By extending and generalizing well-known concepts of relative orbital elements within the restricted two-body problem to the three- and four-body problems, this paper lays the foundation for practical control schemes of relative motion in cislunar space.

Title: Solving Inverse Problems with FLAIR
Authors: Julius Erbach, Dominik Narnhofer, Andreas Dombos, Bernt Schiele, Jan Eric Lenssen, Konrad Schindler
Abstract: Flow-based latent generative models such as Stable Diffusion 3 are able to generate images with remarkable quality, even enabling photorealistic text-to-image generation. Their impressive performance suggests that these models should also constitute powerful priors for inverse imaging problems, but that approach has not yet led to comparable fidelity. There are several key obstacles: (i) the data likelihood term is usually intractable; (ii) learned generative models cannot be directly conditioned on the distorted observations, leading to conflicting objectives between data likelihood and prior; and (iii) the reconstructions can deviate from the observed data. We present FLAIR, a novel, training-free variational framework that leverages flow-based generative models as prior for inverse problems. To that end, we introduce a variational objective for flow matching that is agnostic to the type of degradation, and combine it with deterministic trajectory adjustments to guide the prior towards regions which are more likely under the posterior. To enforce exact consistency with the observed data, we decouple the optimization of the data fidelity and regularization terms. Moreover, we introduce a time-dependent calibration scheme in which the strength of the regularization is modulated according to off-line accuracy estimates. Results on standard imaging benchmarks demonstrate that FLAIR consistently outperforms existing diffusion- and flow-based methods in terms of reconstruction quality and sample diversity.

Title: Phonikud: Hebrew Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion for Real-Time Text-to-Speech
Authors: Yakov Kolani, Maxim Melichov, Cobi Calev, Morris Alper
Abstract: Real-time text-to-speech (TTS) for Modern Hebrew is challenging due to the language's orthographic complexity. Existing solutions ignore crucial phonetic features such as stress that remain underspecified even when vowel marks are added. To address these limitations, we introduce Phonikud, a lightweight, open-source Hebrew grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) system that outputs fully-specified IPA transcriptions. Our approach adapts an existing diacritization model with lightweight adaptors, incurring negligible additional latency. We also contribute the ILSpeech dataset of transcribed Hebrew speech with IPA annotations, serving as a benchmark for Hebrew G2P, as training data for TTS systems, and enabling audio-to-IPA for evaluating TTS performance while capturing important phonetic details. Our results demonstrate that Phonikud G2P conversion more accurately predicts phonemes from Hebrew text compared to prior methods, and that this enables training of effective real-time Hebrew TTS models with superior speed-accuracy trade-offs. We release our code, data, and models at https: //phonikud.this http URL.

Authors: Sean Patrick O'Neil, Edmond Jonckheere, Sophie Schirmer
Abstract: Differential sensitivity techniques originally developed to study the robustness of energy landscape controllers are generalized to the important case of closed quantum systems subject to continuously varying controls. Vanishing sensitivity to parameter variation is shown to coincide with perfect fidelity, as was the case for time-invariant controls. Upper bounds on the magnitude of the differential sensitivity to any parameter variation are derived based simply on knowledge of the system Hamiltonian and the maximum size of the control inputs.

Title: DiffMark: Diffusion-based Robust Watermark Against Deepfakes
Authors: Chen Sun, Haiyang Sun, Zhiqing Guo, Yunfeng Diao, Liejun Wang, Dan Ma, Gaobo Yang, Keqin Li
Abstract: Deepfakes pose significant security and privacy threats through malicious facial manipulations. While robust watermarking can aid in authenticity verification and source tracking, existing methods often lack the sufficient robustness against Deepfake manipulations. Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in image generation, enabling the seamless fusion of watermark with image during generation. In this study, we propose a novel robust watermarking framework based on diffusion model, called DiffMark. By modifying the training and sampling scheme, we take the facial image and watermark as conditions to guide the diffusion model to progressively denoise and generate corresponding watermarked image. In the construction of facial condition, we weight the facial image by a timestep-dependent factor that gradually reduces the guidance intensity with the decrease of noise, thus better adapting to the sampling process of diffusion model. To achieve the fusion of watermark condition, we introduce a cross information fusion (CIF) module that leverages a learnable embedding table to adaptively extract watermark features and integrates them with image features via cross-attention. To enhance the robustness of the watermark against Deepfake manipulations, we integrate a frozen autoencoder during training phase to simulate Deepfake manipulations. Additionally, we introduce Deepfake-resistant guidance that employs specific Deepfake model to adversarially guide the diffusion sampling process to generate more robust watermarked images. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DiffMark on typical Deepfakes. Our code will be available at this https URL.

Title: Direction Estimation of Sound Sources Using Microphone Arrays and Signal Strength
Authors: Mahdi Ali Pour, Zahra Habibzadeh
Abstract: Sound-tracking refers to the process of determining the direction from which a sound originates, making it a fundamental component of sound source localization. This capability is essential in a variety of applications, including security systems, acoustic monitoring, and speaker tracking, where accurately identifying the direction of a sound source enables real-time responses, efficient resource allocation, and improved situational awareness. While sound-tracking is closely related to localization, it specifically focuses on identifying the direction of the sound source rather than estimating its exact position in space. Despite its utility, sound-tracking systems face several challenges, such as maintaining directional accuracy and precision, along with the need for sophisticated hardware configurations and complex signal processing algorithms. This paper presents a sound-tracking method using three electret microphones. We estimate the direction of a sound source using a lightweight method that analyzes signals from three strategically placed microphones. By comparing the average power of the received signals, the system infers the most probable direction of the sound. The results indicate that the power level from each microphone effectively determines the sound source direction. Our system employs a straightforward and cost-effective hardware design, ensuring simplicity and affordability in implementation. It achieves a localization error of less than 6 degrees and a precision of 98%. Additionally, its effortless integration with various systems makes it versatile and adaptable. Consequently, this technique presents a robust and reliable solution for sound-tracking and localization, with potential applications spanning diverse domains such as security systems, smart homes, and acoustic monitoring.

Title: Transferable Parasitic Estimation via Graph Contrastive Learning and Label Rebalancing in AMS Circuits
Authors: Shan Shen, Shenglu Hua, Jiajun Zou, Jiawei Liu, Jianwang Zhai, Chuan Shi, Wenjian Yu
Abstract: Graph representation learning on Analog-Mixed Signal (AMS) circuits is crucial for various downstream tasks, e.g., parasitic estimation. However, the scarcity of design data, the unbalanced distribution of labels, and the inherent diversity of circuit implementations pose significant challenges to learning robust and transferable circuit representations. To address these limitations, we propose CircuitGCL, a novel graph contrastive learning framework that integrates representation scattering and label rebalancing to enhance transferability across heterogeneous circuit graphs. CircuitGCL employs a self-supervised strategy to learn topology-invariant node embeddings through hyperspherical representation scattering, eliminating dependency on large-scale data. Simultaneously, balanced mean squared error (BMSE) and balanced softmax cross-entropy (BSCE) losses are introduced to mitigate label distribution disparities between circuits, enabling robust and transferable parasitic estimation. Evaluated on parasitic capacitance estimation (edge-level task) and ground capacitance classification (node-level task) across TSMC 28nm AMS designs, CircuitGCL outperforms all state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with the $R^2$ improvement of $33.64\% \sim 44.20\%$ for edge regression and F1-score gain of $0.9\times \sim 2.1\times$ for node classification.

Title: MAE-SAM2: Mask Autoencoder-Enhanced SAM2 for Clinical Retinal Vascular Leakage Segmentation
Authors: Xin Xing, Irmak Karaca, Amir Akhavanrezayat, Samira Badrloo, Quan Dong Nguyen, Mahadevan Subramaniam
Abstract: We propose MAE-SAM2, a novel foundation model for retinal vascular leakage segmentation on fluorescein angiography images. Due to the small size and dense distribution of the leakage areas, along with the limited availability of labeled clinical data, this presents a significant challenge for segmentation tasks. Our approach integrates a Self-Supervised learning (SSL) strategy, Masked Autoencoder (MAE), with SAM2. In our implementation, we explore different loss functions and conclude a task-specific combined loss. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that MAE-SAM2 outperforms several state-of-the-art models, achieving the highest Dice score and Intersection-over-Union (IoU). Compared to the original SAM2, our model achieves a $5\%$ performance improvement, highlighting the promise of foundation models with self-supervised pretraining in clinical imaging tasks.

Title: Machine Learning Detection of Lithium Plating in Lithium-ion Cells: A Gaussian Process Approach
Authors: Ayush Patnaik, Jackson Fogelquist, Adam B Zufall, Stephen K Robinson, Xinfan Lin
Abstract: Lithium plating during fast charging is a critical degradation mechanism that accelerates capacity fade and can trigger catastrophic safety failures. Recent work has identified a distinctive dQ/dV peak above 4.0 V as a reliable signature of plating onset; however, conventional methods for computing dQ/dV rely on finite differencing with filtering, which amplifies sensor noise and introduces bias in peak location. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Process (GP) framework for lithium plating detection by directly modeling the charge-voltage relationship Q(V) as a stochastic process with calibrated uncertainty. Leveraging the property that derivatives of GPs remain GPs, we infer dQ/dV analytically and probabilistically from the posterior, enabling robust detection without ad hoc smoothing. The framework provides three key benefits: (i) noise-aware inference with hyperparameters learned from data, (ii) closed-form derivatives with credible intervals for uncertainty quantification, and (iii) scalability to online variants suitable for embedded BMS. Experimental validation on Li-ion coin cells across a range of C-rates (0.2C-1C) and temperatures (0-40°C) demonstrates that the GP-based method reliably detects plating peaks under low-temperature, high-rate charging, while correctly reporting no peaks in baseline cases. The concurrence of GP-identified differential peaks, reduced charge throughput, and capacity fade measured via reference performance tests confirms the method's accuracy and robustness, establishing a practical pathway for real-time lithium plating detection.

Title: Authentication Security of PRF GNSS Ranging
Authors: Jason Anderson
Abstract: This work derives the authentication security of pseudorandom function (PRF) GNSS ranging under multiple GNSS spoofing models, including the Security Code Estimation and Replay (SCER) spoofer. When GNSS ranging codes derive from a PRF utilizing a secret known only to the broadcaster, the spoofer cannot predict the ranging code before broadcast. Therefore, PRF ranging can be used to establish trust in the GNSS pseudoranges and the resulting receiver position, navigation, and timing (PNT) solution. I apply the methods herein to Galileo's Signal Authentication Service (SAS) utilizing the encrypted Galileo E6-C signal to compute that, at most, 400 ms of Galileo E6-C data to assert 128-bit authentication security under non-SCER models. For the SCER adversary, I predict the adversary's needed receiving radio equipment to break authentication security. One can use this work to design a PRF GNSS ranging protocol to meet useful authentication security requirements by computing the probability of missed detection.

Title: Geometry of Distance Protection
Authors: Josh A. Taylor, Alejandro D. Domínguez-García
Abstract: Distance relays detect faults on transmission lines. They face uncertainty from the fault's location and resistance, as well as the current from the line's remote terminal. In this paper, we aggregate this uncertainty with the Minkowski sum. This allows us to explicitly model the power grid surrounding the relay's line, and in turn accommodate any mix of synchronous machines and inverter-based resources. To make the relay's task easier, inverters can inject perturbations, or auxiliary signals, such as negative-sequence current. We use Farkas' lemma to construct an optimization for designing inverter auxiliary signals.

Title: Optimization via a Control-Centric Framework
Authors: Liraz Mudrik, Isaac Kaminer, Sean Kragelund, Abram H. Clark
Abstract: Optimization plays a central role in intelligent systems and cyber-physical technologies, where speed and reliability of convergence directly impact performance. In control theory, optimization-centric methods are standard: controllers are designed by repeatedly solving optimization problems, as in linear quadratic regulation, $H_\infty$ control, and model predictive control. In contrast, this paper develops a control-centric framework for optimization itself, where algorithms are constructed directly from Lyapunov stability principles rather than being proposed first and analyzed afterward. A key element is the stationarity vector, which encodes first-order optimality conditions and enables Lyapunov-based convergence analysis. By pairing a Lyapunov function with a selectable decay law, we obtain continuous-time dynamics with guaranteed exponential, finite-time, fixed-time, or prescribed-time convergence. Within this framework, we introduce three feedback realizations of increasing restrictiveness: the Hessian-gradient, Newton, and gradient dynamics. Each realization shapes the decay of the stationarity vector to achieve the desired rate. These constructions unify unconstrained optimization, extend naturally to constrained problems via Lyapunov-consistent primal-dual dynamics, and broaden the results for minimax and generalized Nash equilibrium seeking problems beyond exponential stability. The framework provides systematic design tools for optimization algorithms in control and game-theoretic problems.
