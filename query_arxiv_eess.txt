Title: Real-Time Guidewire Tip Tracking Using a Siamese Network for Image-Guided Endovascular Procedures
Authors: Tianliang Yao, Zhiqiang Pei, Yong Li, Yixuan Yuan, Peng Qi
Abstract: An ever-growing incorporation of AI solutions into clinical practices enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare services. This paper focuses on guidewire tip tracking tasks during image-guided therapy for cardiovascular diseases, aiding physicians in improving diagnostic and therapeutic quality. A novel tracking framework based on a Siamese network with dual attention mechanisms combines self- and cross-attention strategies for robust guidewire tip tracking. This design handles visual ambiguities, tissue deformations, and imaging artifacts through enhanced spatial-temporal feature learning. Validation occurred on 3 randomly selected clinical digital subtraction angiography (DSA) sequences from a dataset of 15 sequences, covering multiple interventional scenarios. The results indicate a mean localization error of 0.421 $\pm$ 0.138 mm, with a maximum error of 1.736 mm, and a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.782. The framework maintains an average processing speed of 57.2 frames per second, meeting the temporal demands of endovascular imaging. Further validations with robotic platforms for automating diagnostics and therapies in clinical routines yielded tracking errors of 0.708 $\pm$ 0.695 mm and 0.148 $\pm$ 0.057 mm in two distinct experimental scenarios.

Title: Do Music Source Separation Models Preserve Spatial Information in Binaural Audio?
Authors: Richa Namballa, Agnieszka Roginska, Magdalena Fuentes
Abstract: Binaural audio remains underexplored within the music information retrieval community. Motivated by the rising popularity of virtual and augmented reality experiences as well as potential applications to accessibility, we investigate how well existing music source separation (MSS) models perform on binaural audio. Although these models process two-channel inputs, it is unclear how effectively they retain spatial information. In this work, we evaluate how several popular MSS models preserve spatial information on both standard stereo and novel binaural datasets. Our binaural data is synthesized using stems from MUSDB18-HQ and open-source head-related transfer functions by positioning instrument sources randomly along the horizontal plane. We then assess the spatial quality of the separated stems using signal processing and interaural cue-based metrics. Our results show that stereo MSS models fail to preserve the spatial information critical for maintaining the immersive quality of binaural audio, and that the degradation depends on model architecture as well as the target instrument. Finally, we highlight valuable opportunities for future work at the intersection of MSS and immersive audio.

Title: Multimodal, Multi-Disease Medical Imaging Foundation Model (MerMED-FM)
Authors: Yang Zhou, Chrystie Wan Ning Quek, Jun Zhou, Yan Wang, Yang Bai, Yuhe Ke, Jie Yao, Laura Gutierrez, Zhen Ling Teo, Darren Shu Jeng Ting, Brian T. Soetikno, Christopher S. Nielsen, Tobias Elze, Zengxiang Li, Linh Le Dinh, Lionel Tim-Ee Cheng, Tran Nguyen Tuan Anh, Chee Leong Cheng, Tien Yin Wong, Nan Liu, Iain Beehuat Tan, Tony Kiat Hon Lim, Rick Siow Mong Goh, Yong Liu, Daniel Shu Wei Ting
Abstract: Current artificial intelligence models for medical imaging are predominantly single modality and single disease. Attempts to create multimodal and multi-disease models have resulted in inconsistent clinical accuracy. Furthermore, training these models typically requires large, labour-intensive, well-labelled datasets. We developed MerMED-FM, a state-of-the-art multimodal, multi-specialty foundation model trained using self-supervised learning and a memory module. MerMED-FM was trained on 3.3 million medical images from over ten specialties and seven modalities, including computed tomography (CT), chest X-rays (CXR), ultrasound (US), pathology patches, color fundus photography (CFP), optical coherence tomography (OCT) and dermatology images. MerMED-FM was evaluated across multiple diseases and compared against existing foundational models. Strong performance was achieved across all modalities, with AUROCs of 0.988 (OCT); 0.982 (pathology); 0.951 (US); 0.943 (CT); 0.931 (skin); 0.894 (CFP); 0.858 (CXR). MerMED-FM has the potential to be a highly adaptable, versatile, cross-specialty foundation model that enables robust medical imaging interpretation across diverse medical disciplines.

Title: Towards 3D Semantic Image Synthesis for Medical Imaging
Authors: Wenwu Tang, Khaled Seyam, Bin Yang
Abstract: In the medical domain, acquiring large datasets is challenging due to both accessibility issues and stringent privacy regulations. Consequently, data availability and privacy protection are major obstacles to applying machine learning in medical imaging. To address this, our study proposes the Med-LSDM (Latent Semantic Diffusion Model), which operates directly in the 3D domain and leverages de-identified semantic maps to generate synthetic data as a method of privacy preservation and data augmentation. Unlike many existing methods that focus on generating 2D slices, Med-LSDM is designed specifically for 3D semantic image synthesis, making it well-suited for applications requiring full volumetric data. Med-LSDM incorporates a guiding mechanism that controls the 3D image generation process by applying a diffusion model within the latent space of a pre-trained VQ-GAN. By operating in the compressed latent space, the model significantly reduces computational complexity while still preserving critical 3D spatial details. Our approach demonstrates strong performance in 3D semantic medical image synthesis, achieving a 3D-FID score of 0.0054 on the conditional Duke Breast dataset and similar Dice scores (0.70964) to those of real images (0.71496). These results demonstrate that the synthetic data from our model have a small domain gap with real data and are useful for data augmentation.

Title: SurgiSR4K: A High-Resolution Endoscopic Video Dataset for Robotic-Assisted Minimally Invasive Procedures
Authors: Fengyi Jiang, Xiaorui Zhang, Lingbo Jin, Ruixing Liang, Yuxin Chen, Adi Chola Venkatesh, Jason Culman, Tiantian Wu, Lirong Shao, Wenqing Sun, Cong Gao, Hallie McNamara, Jingpei Lu, Omid Mohareri
Abstract: High-resolution imaging is crucial for enhancing visual clarity and enabling precise computer-assisted guidance in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Despite the increasing adoption of 4K endoscopic systems, there remains a significant gap in publicly available native 4K datasets tailored specifically for robotic-assisted MIS. We introduce SurgiSR4K, the first publicly accessible surgical imaging and video dataset captured at a native 4K resolution, representing realistic conditions of robotic-assisted procedures. SurgiSR4K comprises diverse visual scenarios including specular reflections, tool occlusions, bleeding, and soft tissue deformations, meticulously designed to reflect common challenges faced during laparoscopic and robotic surgeries. This dataset opens up possibilities for a broad range of computer vision tasks that might benefit from high resolution data, such as super resolution (SR), smoke removal, surgical instrument detection, 3D tissue reconstruction, monocular depth estimation, instance segmentation, novel view synthesis, and vision-language model (VLM) development. SurgiSR4K provides a robust foundation for advancing research in high-resolution surgical imaging and fosters the development of intelligent imaging technologies aimed at enhancing performance, safety, and usability in image-guided robotic surgeries.

Title: Investigating Stochastic Methods for Prosody Modeling in Speech Synthesis
Authors: Paul Mayer, Florian Lux, Alejandro Pérez-González-de-Martos, Angelina Elizarova, Lindsey Vanderlyn, Dirk Väth, Ngoc Thang Vu
Abstract: While generative methods have progressed rapidly in recent years, generating expressive prosody for an utterance remains a challenging task in text-to-speech synthesis. This is particularly true for systems that model prosody explicitly through parameters such as pitch, energy, and duration, which is commonly done for the sake of interpretability and controllability. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of stochastic methods for this task, including Normalizing Flows, Conditional Flow Matching, and Rectified Flows. We compare these methods to a traditional deterministic baseline, as well as to real human realizations. Our extensive subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate that stochastic methods produce natural prosody on par with human speakers by capturing the variability inherent in human speech. Further, they open up additional controllability options by allowing the sampling temperature to be tuned.

Title: EMSpice 2.1: A Coupled EM and IR Drop Analysis Tool with Joule Heating and Thermal Map Integration for VLSI Reliability
Authors: Subed Lamichhane, Haotian Lu, Sheldon X.-D. Tan
Abstract: Electromigration (EM) remains a critical reliability concern in current and future copper-based VLSI circuits. As technology scales down, EM-induced IR drop becomes increasingly severe. While several EM-aware IR drop analysis tools have been proposed, few incorporate the real impact of temperature distribution on both EM and IR drop effects. In this work, we introduce EMSpice 2.1, an enhanced tool built upon the existing coupled IR-EM analysis framework, EMSpice 2.0, for EM-aware IR drop analysis. For the first time, EMSpice 2.1 uniquely integrates Joule heating effects and practical thermal maps derived from actual chip conditions. Additionally, it features improved interoperability with commercial EDA tools, facilitating more comprehensive EM and IR drop sign-off analysis. Our findings demonstrate that specific hotspot patterns significantly impact the lifetime of interconnects and overall chip reliability due to EM failures. Furthermore, our tool exhibits strong agreement with industry-standard tools such as COMSOL, achieving a speedup of over 200 times while maintaining high accuracy.

Title: Iteratively Saturated Kalman Filtering
Authors: Alan Yang, Stephen Boyd
Abstract: The Kalman filter (KF) provides optimal recursive state estimates for linear-Gaussian systems and underpins applications in control, signal processing, and others. However, it is vulnerable to outliers in the measurements and process noise. We introduce the iteratively saturated Kalman filter (ISKF), which is derived as a scaled gradient method for solving a convex robust estimation problem. It achieves outlier robustness while preserving the KF's low per-step cost and implementation simplicity, since in practice it typically requires only one or two iterations to achieve good performance. The ISKF also admits a steady-state variant that, like the standard steady-state KF, does not require linear system solves in each time step, making it well-suited for real-time systems.

Title: Fast Simulation of Damage Diffusion Distribution in Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy
Authors: Amir Javadi Rad, Amirafshar Moshtaghpour, Dongdong Chen, Angus I. Kirkland
Abstract: Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) is a critical tool for imaging the properties of materials and biological specimens at atomic scale, yet our understanding of relevant electron beam damage mechanisms is incomplete. Recent studies suggest that certain types of damage can be modelled as a diffusion process. However, numerical simulation of such diffusion processes has remained computationally intensive. This work introduces a high-performance C++ framework for simulating damage diffusion process in STEM that combines efficient numerical computation, advanced visualisations, and multithreading to achieve efficient runtime while maintaining accuracy.

Title: Collecting, Curating, and Annotating Good Quality Speech deepfake dataset for Famous Figures: Process and Challenges
Authors: Hashim Ali, Surya Subramani, Raksha Varahamurthy, Nithin Adupa, Lekha Bollinani, Hafiz Malik
Abstract: Recent advances in speech synthesis have introduced unprecedented challenges in maintaining voice authenticity, particularly concerning public figures who are frequent targets of impersonation attacks. This paper presents a comprehensive methodology for collecting, curating, and generating synthetic speech data for political figures and a detailed analysis of challenges encountered. We introduce a systematic approach incorporating an automated pipeline for collecting high-quality bonafide speech samples, featuring transcription-based segmentation that significantly improves synthetic speech quality. We experimented with various synthesis approaches; from single-speaker to zero-shot synthesis, and documented the evolution of our methodology. The resulting dataset comprises bonafide and synthetic speech samples from ten public figures, demonstrating superior quality with a NISQA-TTS naturalness score of 3.69 and the highest human misclassification rate of 61.9\%.

Title: Augmented Physics-Based Li-ion Battery Model via Adaptive Ensemble Sparse Learning and Conformal Prediction
Authors: Samuel Filgueira da Silva, Mehmet Fatih Ozkan, Faissal El Idrissi, Marcello Canova
Abstract: Accurate electrochemical models are essential for the safe and efficient operation of lithium-ion batteries in real-world applications such as electrified vehicles and grid storage. Reduced-order models (ROM) offer a balance between fidelity and computational efficiency but often struggle to capture complex and nonlinear behaviors, such as the dynamics in the cell voltage response under high C-rate conditions. To address these limitations, this study proposes an Adaptive Ensemble Sparse Identification (AESI) framework that enhances the accuracy of reduced-order li-ion battery models by compensating for unpredictable dynamics. The approach integrates an Extended Single Particle Model (ESPM) with an evolutionary ensemble sparse learning strategy to construct a robust hybrid model. In addition, the AESI framework incorporates a conformal prediction method to provide theoretically guaranteed uncertainty quantification for voltage error dynamics, thereby improving the reliability of the model's predictions. Evaluation across diverse operating conditions shows that the hybrid model (ESPM + AESI) improves the voltage prediction accuracy, achieving mean squared error reductions of up to 46% on unseen data. Prediction reliability is further supported by conformal prediction, yielding statistically valid prediction intervals with coverage ratios of 96.85% and 97.41% for the ensemble models based on bagging and stability selection, respectively.

Title: Accurate and Efficient Fetal Birth Weight Estimation from 3D Ultrasound
Authors: Jian Wang, Qiongying Ni, Hongkui Yu, Ruixuan Yao, Jinqiao Ying, Bin Zhang, Xingyi Yang, Jin Peng, Jiongquan Chen, Junxuan Yu, Wenlong Shi, Chaoyu Chen, Zhongnuo Yan, Mingyuan Luo, Gaocheng Cai, Dong Ni, Jing Lu, Xin Yang
Abstract: Accurate fetal birth weight (FBW) estimation is essential for optimizing delivery decisions and reducing perinatal mortality. However, clinical methods for FBW estimation are inefficient, operator-dependent, and challenging to apply in cases of complex fetal anatomy. Existing deep learning methods are based on 2D standard ultrasound (US) images or videos that lack spatial information, limiting their prediction accuracy. In this study, we propose the first method for directly estimating FBW from 3D fetal US volumes. Our approach integrates a multi-scale feature fusion network (MFFN) and a synthetic sample-based learning framework (SSLF). The MFFN effectively extracts and fuses multi-scale features under sparse supervision by incorporating channel attention, spatial attention, and a ranking-based loss function. SSLF generates synthetic samples by simply combining fetal head and abdomen data from different fetuses, utilizing semi-supervised learning to improve prediction performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance, with a mean absolute error of $166.4\pm155.9$ $g$ and a mean absolute percentage error of $5.1\pm4.6$%, outperforming existing methods and approaching the accuracy of a senior doctor.

Title: Minimal Construction of Graphs with Maximum Robustness
Authors: Haejoon Lee, Dimitra Panagou
Abstract: The notions of network $r$-robustness and $(r,s)$-robustness have been earlier introduced in the literature to achieve resilient control in the presence of misbehaving agents. However, while higher robustness levels provide networks with higher tolerances against the misbehaving agents, they also require dense communication structures, which are not always desirable for systems with limited capabilities and energy capacities. Therefore, this paper studies the fundamental structures behind $r$-robustness and $(r,s)$- robustness properties in two different ways. (a) We first explore and establish the tight necessary conditions on the number of edges for undirected graphs with any nodes must satisfy to achieve maximum $r$- and $(r,s)$-robustness. (b) We then use these conditions to construct two classes of undirected graphs, referred as to $\gamma$- and $(\gamma,\gamma)$-Minimal Edge Robust Graphs (MERGs), that provably achieve maximum robustness with minimal numbers of edges. We finally validate our work through some sets of simulations.

Title: Multi-Agent Coordination under Poisson Observations: A Global Game Approach
Authors: Marcos M. Vasconcelos, Behrouz Touri
Abstract: We study a model of strategic coordination based on a class of games with incomplete information known as Global Games. Under the assumption of Poisson-distributed signals and a Gamma prior distribution on state of the system, we demonstrate the existence of a Bayesian Nash equilibrium within the class of threshold policies for utility functions that are linear in the agents' actions. Although computing the exact threshold that constitutes an equilibrium in a system with finitely many agents is a highly non-trivial task, the problem becomes tractable by analyzing the game's potential function with countably infinitely many agents. Through numerical examples, we provide evidence that the resulting potential function is unimodal, exhibiting a well-defined maximum. Our results are applicable to the modeling of bacterial Quorum Sensing systems, whose noisy observation signals are often well-approximated using Poisson processes.

Title: The impact of the following vehicles behaviors on the car following behaviors of the ego-vehicle
Authors: Yang Liu, Jiahao Zhang, Yuxuan Ouyang, Huan Yu, Dengbo He
Abstract: Among all types of crashes, rear-end crashes dominate, which are closely related to the car-following (CF) behaviors. Traditional CF behavior models focused on the influence of the vehicle in front, but usually ignored the peer pressure from the surrounding road users, including the following vehicle (FV). Based on an open dataset, the highD dataset, we investigated whether the FV's states can affect the CF behavior of the ego-vehicle in CF events. Two types of CF events were extracted from highD database, including the tailgated events, where the time headway between the FV and the ego-vehicle (i.e., time gap) was smaller than 1 second, and the gapped events, where the time gap was larger than 3 seconds. The dynamic time warping was used to extract CF pairs with similar speed profiles of the leading vehicle (LV). Statistical analyses were conducted to compare the CF-performance metrics in tailgated and gapped events. Then, the inverse reinforcement learning was used to recover the reward function of the ego-vehicle drivers in different CF events. The results showed that the ego-driver would adjust their CF behavior in response to the pressure from a tailgating FV, by maintaining a closer distance to the LV, but at the same time, driving more cautiously. Further, drivers were still able to adjust their CF strategies based on the speed of traffic flow and the distance to the LV, even when being tailgated. These findings provide insights regarding more accurate modelling of traffic flow by considering the peer pressure from surrounding road users.

Title: Mitigating Language Mismatch in SSL-Based Speaker Anonymization
Authors: Zhe Zhang, Wen-Chin Huang, Xin Wang, Xiaoxiao Miao, Junichi Yamagishi
Abstract: Speaker anonymization aims to protect speaker identity while preserving content information and the intelligibility of speech. However, most speaker anonymization systems (SASs) are developed and evaluated using only English, resulting in degraded utility for other languages. This paper investigates language mismatch in SASs for Japanese and Mandarin speech. First, we fine-tune a self-supervised learning (SSL)-based content encoder with Japanese speech to verify effective language adaptation. Then, we propose fine-tuning a multilingual SSL model with Japanese speech and evaluating the SAS in Japanese and Mandarin. Downstream experiments show that fine-tuning an English-only SSL model with the target language enhances intelligibility while maintaining privacy and that multilingual SSL further extends SASs' utility across different languages. These findings highlight the importance of language adaptation and multilingual pre-training of SSLs for robust multilingual speaker anonymization.

Title: Quadrature Over-the-Air-Computing for Multimodal Dual-Stream Signal Processing
Authors: Hyeon Seok Rou, Kengo Ando, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, David González G
Abstract: We propose a novel quadrature over-the-air computing (Q-OTAC) framework that enables the simultaneously computation of two independent functions and/or data stream within a single transmission. In contrast to conventional OTAC schemes, where a single function is computed by treating each complex signal as a single component, the proposed Q-OTAC exploits both in-phase and quadrature (IQ) components of a complex signal, encoding two distinct functions and/or data streams at the edge devices (EDs) and employing a novel low-complexity IQ-decoupled combiner at the access point (AP) to independently recover each stream, which effectively doubles the computation rate. A key strength of this framework lies in its simplicity and broad compatibility: the extension into the quadrature domain is conceptually straightforward, yet remakably powerful, allowing seamless integration into existing OTAC techniques. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of this approach, including the first demonstration of dual-function aggregation (e.g., parallel summation and product), highlighting the potential of Q-OTAC for enabling multi-modal and high-efficiency beyond fifth generation (B5G) applications.

Title: Medical Image Segmentation Using Advanced Unet: VMSE-Unet and VM-Unet CBAM+
Authors: Sayandeep Kanrar, Raja Piyush, Qaiser Razi, Debanshi Chakraborty, Vikas Hassija, GSS Chalapathi
Abstract: In this paper, we present the VMSE U-Net and VM-Unet CBAM+ model, two cutting-edge deep learning architectures designed to enhance medical image segmentation. Our approach integrates Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) and Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) techniques into the traditional VM U-Net framework, significantly improving segmentation accuracy, feature localization, and computational efficiency. Both models show superior performance compared to the baseline VM-Unet across multiple datasets. Notably, VMSEUnet achieves the highest accuracy, IoU, precision, and recall while maintaining low loss values. It also exhibits exceptional computational efficiency with faster inference times and lower memory usage on both GPU and CPU. Overall, the study suggests that the enhanced architecture VMSE-Unet is a valuable tool for medical image analysis. These findings highlight its potential for real-world clinical applications, emphasizing the importance of further research to optimize accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.

Title: Anti-aliasing Algorithm Based on Three-dimensional Display Image
Authors: Ziyang Liu, Xingchen Xiao, Yueyang Xu
Abstract: 3D-display technology has been a promising emerging area with potential to be the core of next-generation display technology. When directly observing unprocessed images and text through a naked-eye 3D display device, severe distortion and jaggedness will be displayed, which will make the display effect much worse. In this work, we try to settle down such degradation with spatial and frequency processing, furthermore, we make efforts to extract degenerate function of columnar lens array thus fundamentally eliminating degradation.

Title: Fair Rate Maximization for Fluid Antenna Relay (FAR)-assisted Multi-user MISO Communications
Authors: Ruopeng Xu, Zhaohui Yang, Ting Zhang, Mingzhe Chen, Chen Zhu, Zhaoyang Zhang
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of max-min rate maximization in fluid antenna relay (FAR)-assisted multi-user uplink multiple-input single-output (MISO) wireless systems, where each user is equipped with a single fluid antenna (FA) and the base station (BS) is equipped with multiple FAs. Unlike most existing relevant work focusing on maximizing sum rate of the fluid antenna system (FAS), which may cause unbearable rate loss to weak users, we propose to maximize the minimal rate of the system to ensure fairness. The max-min optimization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the positions of FAs with meeting the minimum distance requirements of FAs, maximum transmitting power limit, and feasible antenna region constraints. To solve this problem, we propose an alternating algorithm with utilizing the successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional methods in terms of maximizing the minimal achievable rate across different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and normalized region sizes.

Title: Delay Bound Relaxation with Deep Learning-based Haptic Estimation for Tactile Internet
Authors: Georgios Kokkinis, Alexandros Iosifidis, Qi Zhang
Abstract: Haptic teleoperation typically demands sub-millisecond latency and ultra-high reliability (99.999%) in Tactile Internet. At a 1 kHz haptic signal sampling rate, this translates into an extremely high packet transmission rate, posing significant challenges for timely delivery and introducing substantial complexity and overhead in radio resource allocation. To address this critical challenge, we introduce a novel DL modelthat estimates force feedback using multi-modal input, i.e. both force measurements from the remote side and local operator motion signals. The DL model can capture complex temporal features of haptic time-series with the use of CNN and LSTM layers, followed by a transformer encoder, and autoregressively produce a highly accurate estimation of the next force values for different teleoperation activities. By ensuring that the estimation error is within a predefined threshold, the teleoperation system can safely relax its strict delay requirements. This enables the batching and transmission of multiple haptic packets within a single resource block, improving resource efficiency and facilitating scheduling in resource allocation. Through extensive simulations, we evaluated network performance in terms of reliability and capacity. Results show that, for both dynamic and rigid object interactions, the proposed method increases the number of reliably served users by up to 66%.

Title: Bridging Classical and Learning-based Iterative Registration through Deep Equilibrium Models
Authors: Yi Zhang, Yidong Zhao, Qian Tao
Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is traditionally formulated as an optimization problem. While classical methods solve this problem iteratively, recent learning-based approaches use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to mimic this process by unrolling the prediction of deformation fields in a fixed number of steps. However, classical methods typically converge after sufficient iterations, but learning-based unrolling methods lack a theoretical convergence guarantee and show instability empirically. In addition, unrolling methods have a practical bottleneck at training time: GPU memory usage grows linearly with the unrolling steps due to backpropagation through time (BPTT). To address both theoretical and practical challenges, we propose DEQReg, a novel registration framework based on Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQ), which formulates registration as an equilibrium-seeking problem, establishing a natural connection between classical optimization and learning-based unrolling methods. DEQReg maintains constant memory usage, enabling theoretically unlimited iteration steps. Through extensive evaluation on the public brain MRI and lung CT datasets, we show that DEQReg can achieve competitive registration performance, while substantially reducing memory consumption compared to state-of-the-art unrolling methods. We also reveal an intriguing phenomenon: the performance of existing unrolling methods first increases slightly then degrades irreversibly when the inference steps go beyond the training configuration. In contrast, DEQReg achieves stable convergence with its inbuilt equilibrium-seeking mechanism, bridging the gap between classical optimization-based and modern learning-based registration methods.

Title: Quantize-Sample-and-Verify: LLM Acceleration via Adaptive Edge-Cloud Speculative Decoding
Authors: Guangyi Zhang, Yunlong Cai, Guanding Yu, Petar Popovski, Osvaldo Simeone
Abstract: In edge-cloud speculative decoding (SD), edge devices equipped with small language models (SLMs) generate draft tokens that are verified by large language models (LLMs) in the cloud. A key bottleneck in such systems is the limited communication bandwidth between edge and cloud, which necessitates quantization of the information transmitted about generated tokens. In this work, we introduce a novel quantize-sample (Q-S) strategy that provably preserves the output distribution of the cloud-based model, ensuring that the verified tokens match the distribution of those that would have been generated directly by the LLM. We develop a throughput model for edge-cloud SD that explicitly accounts for communication latency. Leveraging this model, we propose an adaptive mechanism that optimizes token throughput by dynamically adjusting the draft length and quantization precision in response to both semantic uncertainty and channel conditions. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed Q-S approach significantly improves decoding efficiency in realistic edge-cloud deployment scenarios.

Title: Physics-Informed Neural ODEs for Temporal Dynamics Modeling in Cardiac T1 Mapping
Authors: Nuno Capitão, Yi Zhang, Yidong Zhao, Qian Tao
Abstract: Spin-lattice relaxation time ($T_1$) is an important biomarker in cardiac parametric mapping for characterizing myocardial tissue and diagnosing cardiomyopathies. Conventional Modified Look-Locker Inversion Recovery (MOLLI) acquires 11 breath-hold baseline images with interleaved rest periods to ensure mapping accuracy. However, prolonged scanning can be challenging for patients with poor breathholds, often leading to motion artifacts that degrade image quality. In addition, $T_1$ mapping requires voxel-wise nonlinear fitting to a signal recovery model involving an iterative estimation process. Recent studies have proposed deep-learning approaches for rapid $T_1$ mapping using shortened sequences to reduce acquisition time for patient comfort. Nevertheless, existing methods overlook important physics constraints, limiting interpretability and generalization. In this work, we present an accelerated, end-to-end $T_1$ mapping framework leveraging Physics-Informed Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to model temporal dynamics and address these challenges. Our method achieves high-accuracy $T_1$ estimation from a sparse subset of baseline images and ensures efficient null index estimation at test time. Specifically, we develop a continuous-time LSTM-ODE model to enable selective Look-Locker (LL) data acquisition with arbitrary time lags. Experimental results show superior performance in $T_1$ estimation for both native and post-contrast sequences and demonstrate the strong benefit of our physics-based formulation over direct data-driven $T_1$ priors.

Title: Price Aware Power Split Control in Heterogeneous Battery Storage Systems
Authors: Sheng Yin, Vivek Teja Tanjavooru, Thomas Hamacher, Christoph Goebel, Holger Hesse
Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework for the optimal scheduling of battery dispatch and internal power allocation in Battery energy storage systems (BESS). This novel approach integrates both market-based (price-aware) signals and physical system constraints to simultaneously optimize (1) external energy dispatch and (2) internal heterogeneity management of BESS, enhancing its operational economic value and performance. This work compares both model-based Linear Programming (LP) and model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches for optimization under varying forecast assumptions, using a custom Gym-based simulation environment. The evaluation considers both long-term and short-term performance, focusing on economic savings, State of Charge (SOC) and temperature balancing, and overall system efficiency. In summary, the long-term results show that the RL approach achieved 10% higher system efficiency compared to LP, whereas the latter yielded 33% greater cumulative savings. In terms of internal heterogeneity, the LP approach resulted in lower mean SOC imbalance, while the RL approach achieved better temperature balance between strings. This behavior is further examined in the short-term evaluation, which indicates that LP delivers strong optimization under known and stable conditions, whereas RL demonstrates higher adaptability in dynamic environments, offering potential advantages for real-time BESS control.

Title: MTCNet: Motion and Topology Consistency Guided Learning for Mitral Valve Segmentationin 4D Ultrasound
Authors: Rusi Chen, Yuanting Yang, Jiezhi Yao, Hongning Song, Ji Zhang, Yongsong Zhou, Yuhao Huang, Ronghao Yang, Dan Jia, Yuhan Zhang, Xing Tao, Haoran Dou, Qing Zhou, Xin Yang, Dong Ni
Abstract: Mitral regurgitation is one of the most prevalent cardiac disorders. Four-dimensional (4D) ultrasound has emerged as the primary imaging modality for assessing dynamic valvular morphology. However, 4D mitral valve (MV) analysis remains challenging due to limited phase annotations, severe motion artifacts, and poor imaging quality. Yet, the absence of inter-phase dependency in existing methods hinders 4D MV analysis. To bridge this gap, we propose a Motion-Topology guided consistency network (MTCNet) for accurate 4D MV ultrasound segmentation in semi-supervised learning (SSL). MTCNet requires only sparse end-diastolic and end-systolic annotations. First, we design a cross-phase motion-guided consistency learning strategy, utilizing a bi-directional attention memory bank to propagate spatio-temporal features. This enables MTCNet to achieve excellent performance both per- and inter-phase. Second, we devise a novel topology-guided correlation regularization that explores physical prior knowledge to maintain anatomically plausible. Therefore, MTCNet can effectively leverage structural correspondence between labeled and unlabeled phases. Extensive evaluations on the first largest 4D MV dataset, with 1408 phases from 160 patients, show that MTCNet performs superior cross-phase consistency compared to other advanced methods (Dice: 87.30%, HD: 1.75mm). Both the code and the dataset are available at this https URL.

Title: Mind the Detail: Uncovering Clinically Relevant Image Details in Accelerated MRI with Semantically Diverse Reconstructions
Authors: Jan Nikolas Morshuis, Christian Schlarmann, Thomas Küstner, Christian F. Baumgartner, Matthias Hein
Abstract: In recent years, accelerated MRI reconstruction based on deep learning has led to significant improvements in image quality with impressive results for high acceleration factors. However, from a clinical perspective image quality is only secondary; much more important is that all clinically relevant information is preserved in the reconstruction from heavily undersampled data. In this paper, we show that existing techniques, even when considering resampling for diffusion-based reconstruction, can fail to reconstruct small and rare pathologies, thus leading to potentially wrong diagnosis decisions (false negatives). To uncover the potentially missing clinical information we propose ``Semantically Diverse Reconstructions'' (\SDR), a method which, given an original reconstruction, generates novel reconstructions with enhanced semantic variability while all of them are fully consistent with the measured data. To evaluate \SDR automatically we train an object detector on the fastMRI+ dataset. We show that \SDR significantly reduces the chance of false-negative diagnoses (higher recall) and improves mean average precision compared to the original reconstructions.

Title: Prompt2SegCXR:Prompt to Segment All Organs and Diseases in Chest X-rays
Authors: Abduz Zami, Shadman Sobhan, Rounaq Hossain, Md. Sawran Sorker, Mohiuddin Ahmed, Md. Redwan Hossain
Abstract: Image segmentation plays a vital role in the medical field by isolating organs or regions of interest from surrounding areas. Traditionally, segmentation models are trained on a specific organ or a disease, limiting their ability to handle other organs and diseases. At present, few advanced models can perform multi-organ or multi-disease segmentation, offering greater flexibility. Also, recently, prompt-based image segmentation has gained attention as a more flexible approach. It allows models to segment areas based on user-provided prompts. Despite these advances, there has been no dedicated work on prompt-based interactive multi-organ and multi-disease segmentation, especially for Chest X-rays. This work presents two main contributions: first, generating doodle prompts by medical experts of a collection of datasets from multiple sources with 23 classes, including 6 organs and 17 diseases, specifically designed for prompt-based Chest X-ray segmentation. Second, we introduce Prompt2SegCXR, a lightweight model for accurately segmenting multiple organs and diseases from Chest X-rays. The model incorporates multi-stage feature fusion, enabling it to combine features from various network layers for better spatial and semantic understanding, enhancing segmentation accuracy. Compared to existing pre-trained models for prompt-based image segmentation, our model scores well, providing a reliable solution for segmenting Chest X-rays based on user prompts.

Title: Physical Layer Group Key Generation With the Aid of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces
Authors: Vahid Shahiri, Guyue Li, Hamid Behroozi
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have the ability to alter the wireless environment by making changes in the impinging signal. Motivated by this ability, in this study, we exploit the RIS to make the aggregate reflecting channels of different user terminals (UTs) as similar as possible to be able to extract common group secret keys from their channels. Specifically, the RIS will adjust its parameters to pave the way for group key generation (GKG) based on the physical channels of the UTs. Our method exploits the already gathered channel state information (CSI) in the RIS to beneficially design the phase shifts and does not impose additional probing burden on the network. Additionally, this scheme is broadcast-based and does not entail the overheads of the pairwise-based key generation. We consider both passive RIS (PRIS) and active RIS (ARIS) to generate the group keys. The PRIS is widely adopted in physical layer key generation (PLKG) studies due to its use of passive elements, whereas the ARIS demonstrates superior capability in aligning the aggregate reflected channels among nodes in the GKG scenario, as demonstrated in this study. We will exploit various optimization methods like successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation with Gaussian randomization (SDR-GR) to address the raised optimization problems. Unlike most of the studies in the literature, our scheme can achieve a high GKG rate in static environments as well. Finally, we will examine the performance of the proposed method by normalized mean squared error (NMSE), key error rate (KER), key generation rate (KGR) and key randomness metrics. Our numerical results verify that for the equal available power budget, the ARIS significantly outperforms PRIS in NMSE and KER, achieving more than four times higher KGR.

Title: Tunable Wavelet Unit based Convolutional Neural Network in Optical Coherence Tomography Analysis Enhancement for Classifying Type of Epiretinal Membrane Surgery
Authors: An Le, Nehal Mehta, William Freeman, Ines Nagel, Melanie Tran, Anna Heinke, Akshay Agnihotri, Lingyun Cheng, Dirk-Uwe Bartsch, Hung Nguyen, Truong Nguyen, Cheolhong An
Abstract: In this study, we developed deep learning-based method to classify the type of surgery performed for epiretinal membrane (ERM) removal, either internal limiting membrane (ILM) removal or ERM-alone removal. Our model, based on the ResNet18 convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, utilizes postoperative optical coherence tomography (OCT) center scans as inputs. We evaluated the model using both original scans and scans preprocessed with energy crop and wavelet denoising, achieving 72% accuracy on preprocessed inputs, outperforming the 66% accuracy achieved on original scans. To further improve accuracy, we integrated tunable wavelet units with two key adaptations: Orthogonal Lattice-based Wavelet Units (OrthLatt-UwU) and Perfect Reconstruction Relaxation-based Wavelet Units (PR-Relax-UwU). These units allowed the model to automatically adjust filter coefficients during training and were incorporated into downsampling, stride-two convolution, and pooling layers, enhancing its ability to distinguish between ERM-ILM removal and ERM-alone removal, with OrthLattUwU boosting accuracy to 76% and PR-Relax-UwU increasing performance to 78%. Performance comparisons showed that our AI model outperformed a trained human grader, who achieved only 50% accuracy in classifying the removal surgery types from postoperative OCT scans. These findings highlight the potential of CNN based models to improve clinical decision-making by providing more accurate and reliable classifications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ tunable wavelets for classifying different types of ERM removal surgery.

Title: LearnAFE: Circuit-Algorithm Co-design Framework for Learnable Audio Analog Front-End
Authors: Jinhai Hu, Zhongyi Zhang, Cong Sheng Leow, Wang Ling Goh, Yuan Gao
Abstract: This paper presents a circuit-algorithm co-design framework for learnable analog front-end (AFE) in audio signal classification. Designing AFE and backend classifiers separately is a common practice but non-ideal, as shown in this paper. Instead, this paper proposes a joint optimization of the backend classifier with the AFE's transfer function to achieve system-level optimum. More specifically, the transfer function parameters of an analog bandpass filter (BPF) bank are tuned in a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-aware training loop for the classifier. Using a co-design loss function LBPF, this work shows superior optimization of both the filter bank and the classifier. Implemented in open-source SKY130 130nm CMOS process, the optimized design achieved 90.5%-94.2% accuracy for 10-keyword classification task across a wide range of input signal SNR from 5 dB to 20 dB, with only 22k classifier parameters. Compared to conventional approach, the proposed audio AFE achieves 8.7% and 12.9% reduction in power and capacitor area respectively.

Title: Research on Improving the High Precision and Lightweight Diabetic Retinopathy Detection of YOLOv8n
Authors: Fei Yuhuan, Sun Xufei, Zang Ran, Wang Gengchen, Su Meng, Liu Fenghao
Abstract: Early detection and diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy is one of the current research focuses in ophthalmology. However, due to the subtle features of micro-lesions and their susceptibility to background interference, ex-isting detection methods still face many challenges in terms of accuracy and robustness. To address these issues, a lightweight and high-precision detection model based on the improved YOLOv8n, named YOLO-KFG, is proposed. Firstly, a new dynamic convolution KWConv and C2f-KW module are designed to improve the backbone network, enhancing the model's ability to perceive micro-lesions. Secondly, a fea-ture-focused diffusion pyramid network FDPN is designed to fully integrate multi-scale context information, further improving the model's ability to perceive micro-lesions. Finally, a lightweight shared detection head GSDHead is designed to reduce the model's parameter count, making it more deployable on re-source-constrained devices. Experimental results show that compared with the base model YOLOv8n, the improved model reduces the parameter count by 20.7%, increases mAP@0.5 by 4.1%, and improves the recall rate by 7.9%. Compared with single-stage mainstream algorithms such as YOLOv5n and YOLOv10n, YOLO-KFG demonstrates significant advantages in both detection accuracy and efficiency.

Title: Getting Dynamic Line Ratings into Markets
Authors: Zhiyi Zhou, Christoph Graf, Yury Dvorkin
Abstract: Static transmission line ratings may lead to underutilization of line capacity due to overly conservative (worst-case) assumptions. Grid-enhancing technologies (GETs) such as dynamic line ratings (DLRs), which adjust line capacity based on real-time conditions, are a techno-economically viable alternative to increase the utilization of existing power lines. Nonetheless, their adoption has been slow, partly due to the absence of operational tools that effectively account for simultaneous impacts on dispatch and pricing. In this paper, we represent transmission capacity with DLRs as a stock-like resource with time-variant interdependency, which is modeled via an approximation of line temperature evolution process, decoupling the impacts of ambient weather conditions and power flow on transmission line temperature and thus capacity. We integrate DLRs into a multi-period DC optimal power flow problem, with chance constrains addressing correlated uncertainty in DLRs and renewable generation. This yields non-convex problems that we transform into a tractable convex form by linearization. We derive locational marginal energy and ancillary services prices consistent with a competitive equilibrium. Numerical experiments on the 11-zone and 1814-node NYISO systems demonstrate its performance, including impacts on dispatch, pricing, and marginal carbon emissions.

Title: Adiabatic Capacitive Neuron: An Energy-Efficient Functional Unit for Artificial Neural Networks
Authors: Sachin Maheshwari, Mike Smart, Himadri Singh Raghav, Themis Prodromakis, Alexander Serb
Abstract: This paper introduces a new, highly energy-efficient, Adiabatic Capacitive Neuron (ACN) hardware implementation of an Artificial Neuron (AN) with improved functionality, accuracy, robustness and scalability over previous work. The paper describes the implementation of a \mbox{12-bit} single neuron, with positive and negative weight support, in an $\mathbf{0.18\mu m}$ CMOS technology. The paper also presents a new Threshold Logic (TL) design for a binary AN activation function that generates a low symmetrical offset across three process corners and five temperatures between $-55^o$C and $125^o$C. Post-layout simulations demonstrate a maximum rising and falling offset voltage of 9$mV$ compared to conventional TL, which has rising and falling offset voltages of 27$mV$ and 5$mV$ respectively, across temperature and process. Moreover, the proposed TL design shows a decrease in average energy of 1.5$\%$ at the SS corner and 2.3$\%$ at FF corner compared to the conventional TL design. The total synapse energy saving for the proposed ACN was above 90$\%$ (over 12x improvement) when compared to a non-adiabatic CMOS Capacitive Neuron (CCN) benchmark for a frequency ranging from 500$kHz$ to 100$MHz$. A 1000-sample Monte Carlo simulation including process variation and mismatch confirms the worst-case energy savings of $\>$90$\%$ compared to CCN in the synapse energy profile. Finally, the impact of supply voltage scaling shows consistent energy savings of above 90$\%$ (except all zero inputs) without loss of functionality.

Title: Automated anatomy-based post-processing reduces false positives and improved interpretability of deep learning intracranial aneurysm detection
Authors: Jisoo Kim, Chu-Hsuan Lin, Alberto Ceballos-Arroyo, Ping Liu, Huaizu Jiang, Shrikanth Yadav, Qi Wan, Lei Qin, Geoffrey S Young
Abstract: Introduction: Deep learning (DL) models can help detect intracranial aneurysms on CTA, but high false positive (FP) rates remain a barrier to clinical translation, despite improvement in model architectures and strategies like detection threshold tuning. We employed an automated, anatomy-based, heuristic-learning hybrid artery-vein segmentation post-processing method to further reduce FPs. Methods: Two DL models, CPM-Net and a deformable 3D convolutional neural network-transformer hybrid (3D-CNN-TR), were trained with 1,186 open-source CTAs (1,373 annotated aneurysms), and evaluated with 143 held-out private CTAs (218 annotated aneurysms). Brain, artery, vein, and cavernous venous sinus (CVS) segmentation masks were applied to remove possible FPs in the DL outputs that overlapped with: (1) brain mask; (2) vein mask; (3) vein more than artery masks; (4) brain plus vein mask; (5) brain plus vein more than artery masks. Results: CPM-Net yielded 139 true-positives (TP); 79 false-negative (FN); 126 FP. 3D-CNN-TR yielded 179 TP; 39 FN; 182 FP. FPs were commonly extracranial (CPM-Net 27.3%; 3D-CNN-TR 42.3%), venous (CPM-Net 56.3%; 3D-CNN-TR 29.1%), arterial (CPM-Net 11.9%; 3D-CNN-TR 53.3%), and non-vascular (CPM-Net 25.4%; 3D-CNN-TR 9.3%) structures. Method 5 performed best, reducing CPM-Net FP by 70.6% (89/126) and 3D-CNN-TR FP by 51.6% (94/182), without reducing TP, lowering the FP/case rate from 0.88 to 0.26 for CPM-NET, and from 1.27 to 0.62 for the 3D-CNN-TR. Conclusion: Anatomy-based, interpretable post-processing can improve DL-based aneurysm detection model performance. More broadly, automated, domain-informed, hybrid heuristic-learning processing holds promise for improving the performance and clinical acceptance of aneurysm detection models.

Title: Improving Stereo 3D Sound Event Localization and Detection: Perceptual Features, Stereo-specific Data Augmentation, and Distance Normalization
Authors: Jun-Wei Yeow, Ee-Leng Tan, Santi Peksi, Woon-Seng Gan
Abstract: This technical report presents our submission to Task 3 of the DCASE 2025 Challenge: Stereo Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) in Regular Video Content. We address the audio-only task in this report and introduce several key contributions. First, we design perceptually-motivated input features that improve event detection, sound source localization, and distance estimation. Second, we adapt augmentation strategies specifically for the intricacies of stereo audio, including channel swapping and time-frequency masking. We also incorporate the recently proposed FilterAugment technique that has yet to be explored for SELD work. Lastly, we apply a distance normalization approach during training to stabilize regression targets. Experiments on the stereo STARSS23 dataset demonstrate consistent performance gains across all SELD metrics. Code to replicate our work is available in this repository: this https URL

Title: Verifiable Natural Language to Linear Temporal Logic Translation: A Benchmark Dataset and Evaluation Suite
Authors: William H English, Chase Walker, Dominic Simon, Sumit Kumar Jha, Rickard Ewetz
Abstract: Empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art natural-language (NL) to temporal-logic (TL) translation systems reveals near-perfect performance on existing benchmarks. However, current studies measure only the accuracy of the translation of NL logic into formal TL, ignoring a system's capacity to ground atomic propositions into new scenarios or environments. This is a critical feature, necessary for the verification of resulting formulas in a concrete state space. Consequently, most NL-to-TL translation frameworks propose their own bespoke dataset in which the correct grounding is known a-priori, inflating performance metrics and neglecting the need for extensible, domain-general systems. In this paper, we introduce the Verifiable Linear Temporal Logic Benchmark ( VLTL-Bench), a unifying benchmark that measures verification and verifiability of automated NL-to-LTL translation. The dataset consists of three unique state spaces and thousands of diverse natural language specifications and corresponding formal specifications in temporal logic. Moreover, the benchmark contains sample traces to validate the temporal logic expressions. While the benchmark directly supports end-to-end evaluation, we observe that many frameworks decompose the process into i) lifting, ii) grounding, iii) translation, and iv) verification. The benchmark provides ground truths after each of these steps to enable researches to improve and evaluate different substeps of the overall problem. To encourage methodologically sound advances in verifiable NL-to-LTL translation approaches, we release VLTL-Bench here: this https URL bench.

Title: SComCP: Task-Oriented Semantic Communication for Collaborative Perception
Authors: Jipeng Gan, Yucheng Sheng, Hua Zhang, Le Liang, Hao Ye, Chongtao Guo, Shi Jin
Abstract: Reliable detection of surrounding objects is critical for the safe operation of connected automated vehicles (CAVs). However, inherent limitations such as the restricted perception range and occlusion effects compromise the reliability of single-vehicle perception systems in complex traffic environments. Collaborative perception has emerged as a promising approach by fusing sensor data from surrounding CAVs with diverse viewpoints, thereby improving environmental awareness. Although collaborative perception holds great promise, its performance is bottlenecked by wireless communication constraints, as unreliable and bandwidth-limited channels hinder the transmission of sensor data necessary for real-time perception. To address these challenges, this paper proposes SComCP, a novel task-oriented semantic communication framework for collaborative perception. Specifically, SComCP integrates an importance-aware feature selection network that selects and transmits semantic features most relevant to the perception task, significantly reducing communication overhead without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, we design a semantic codec network based on a joint source and channel coding (JSCC) architecture, which enables bidirectional transformation between semantic features and noise-tolerant channel symbols, thereby ensuring stable perception under adverse wireless conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. In particular, compared to existing approaches, SComCP can maintain superior perception performance across various channel conditions, especially in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios. In addition, SComCP exhibits strong generalization capability, enabling the framework to maintain high performance across diverse channel conditions, even when trained with a specific channel model.

Title: Constellation as a Service: Tailored Connectivity Management in Direct-Satellite-to-Device Networks
Authors: Feng Wang, Shengyu Zhang, Een-Kee Hong, Tony Q.S. Quek
Abstract: Direct-satellite-to-device (DS2D) communication is emerging as a promising solution for global mobile service extension, leveraging the deployment of satellite constellations. However, the challenge of managing DS2D connectivity for multi-constellations becomes outstanding, including high interference and frequent handovers caused by multi-coverage overlap and rapid satellite movement. Moreover, existing approaches primarily operate within single-constellation shell, which inherently limits the ability to exploit the vast potential of multi-constellation connectivity provision, resulting in suboptimal DS2D service performances. To address these challenges, this article proposes a Constellation as a Service (CaaS) framework, which treats the entire multi-constellation infrastructure as a shared resource pool and dynamically forms optimal sub-constellations (SCs) for each DS2D service region. The formation of each SC integrates satellites from various orbits to provide tailored connectivity based on user demands, guided by two innovative strategies: predictive satellite beamforming using generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and pre-configured handover path for efficient satellite access and mobility management. Simulation results demonstrate that CaaS significantly improves satellite service rates while reducing handover overhead, making it an efficient and continuable solution for managing DS2D connectivity in multi-constellation environments.

Title: Deep learning-based segmentation of T1 and T2 cardiac MRI maps for automated disease detection
Authors: Andreea Bianca Popescu, Andreas Seitz, Heiko Mahrholdt, Jens Wetzl, Athira Jacob, Lucian Mihai Itu, Constantin Suciu, Teodora Chitiboi
Abstract: Objectives Parametric tissue mapping enables quantitative cardiac tissue characterization but is limited by inter-observer variability during manual delineation. Traditional approaches relying on average relaxation values and single cutoffs may oversimplify myocardial complexity. This study evaluates whether deep learning (DL) can achieve segmentation accuracy comparable to inter-observer variability, explores the utility of statistical features beyond mean T1/T2 values, and assesses whether machine learning (ML) combining multiple features enhances disease detection. Materials & Methods T1 and T2 maps were manually segmented. The test subset was independently annotated by two observers, and inter-observer variability was assessed. A DL model was trained to segment left ventricle blood pool and myocardium. Average (A), lower quartile (LQ), median (M), and upper quartile (UQ) were computed for the myocardial pixels and employed in classification by applying cutoffs or in ML. Dice similarity coefficient (DICE) and mean absolute percentage error evaluated segmentation performance. Bland-Altman plots assessed inter-user and model-observer agreement. Receiver operating characteristic analysis determined optimal cutoffs. Pearson correlation compared features from model and manual segmentations. F1-score, precision, and recall evaluated classification performance. Wilcoxon test assessed differences between classification methods, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results 144 subjects were split into training (100), validation (15) and evaluation (29) subsets. Segmentation model achieved a DICE of 85.4%, surpassing inter-observer agreement. Random forest applied to all features increased F1-score (92.7%, p < 0.001). Conclusion DL facilitates segmentation of T1/ T2 maps. Combining multiple features with ML improves disease detection.

Title: Enhancing Open RAN Digital Twin Through Power Consumption Measurement
Authors: Ahmed Al-Tahmeesschi, Yi Chu, Josh Shackleton, Swarna Chetty, Mostafa Rahmani, David Grace, Hamed Ahmadi
Abstract: The increasing demand for high-speed, ultra-reliable and low-latency communications in 5G and beyond networks has led to a significant increase in power consumption, particularly within the Radio Access Network (RAN). This growing energy demand raises operational and sustainability challenges for mobile network operators, requiring novel solutions to enhance energy efficiency while maintaining Quality of Service (QoS). 5G networks are evolving towards disaggregated, programmable, and intelligent architectures, with Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) spearheaded by the O-RAN Alliance, enabling greater flexibility, interoperability, and cost-effectiveness. However, this disaggregated approach introduces new complexities, especially in terms of power consumption across different network components, including Open Radio Units (RUs), Open Distributed Units (DUs) and Open Central Units (CUs). Understanding the power efficiency of different O-RAN functional splits is crucial for optimising energy consumption and network sustainability. In this paper, we present a comprehensive measurement study of power consumption in RUs, DUs and CUs under varying network loads, specifically analysing the impact of Physical resource block (PRB) utilisation in Split 8 and Split 7.2b. The measurements were conducted on both software-defined radio (SDR)-based RUs and commercial indoor and outdoor RU, as well as their corresponding DU and CU. By evaluating real-world hardware deployments under different operational conditions, this study provides empirical insights into the power efficiency of various O-RAN configurations. The results highlight that power consumption does not scale significantly with network load, suggesting that a large portion of energy consumption remains constant regardless of traffic demand.

Title: DMCIE: Diffusion Model with Concatenation of Inputs and Errors to Improve the Accuracy of the Segmentation of Brain Tumors in MRI Images
Authors: Sara Yavari, Rahul Nitin Pandya, Jacob Furst
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans is essential for reliable clinical diagnosis and effective treatment planning. Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in image generation and segmentation tasks. This paper introduces a novel approach to corrective segmentation based on diffusion models. We propose DMCIE (Diffusion Model with Concatenation of Inputs and Errors), a novel framework for accurate brain tumor segmentation in multi-modal MRI scans. We employ a 3D U-Net to generate an initial segmentation mask, from which an error map is generated by identifying the differences between the prediction and the ground truth. The error map, concatenated with the original MRI images, are used to guide a diffusion model. Using multimodal MRI inputs (T1, T1ce, T2, FLAIR), DMCIE effectively enhances segmentation accuracy by focusing on misclassified regions, guided by the original inputs. Evaluated on the BraTS2020 dataset, DMCIE outperforms several state-of-the-art diffusion-based segmentation methods, achieving a Dice Score of 93.46 and an HD95 of 5.94 mm. These results highlight the effectiveness of error-guided diffusion in producing precise and reliable brain tumor segmentations.

Authors: Qingqiu Li, Runtian Yuan, Junlin Hou, Jilan Xu, Yuejie Zhang, Rui Feng, Hao Chen
Abstract: To enable more accurate diagnosis of lung disease in chest CT scans, we propose a straightforward yet effective model. Firstly, we analyze the characteristics of 3D CT scans and remove non-lung regions, which helps the model focus on lesion-related areas and reduces computational cost. We adopt ResNeSt50 as a strong feature extractor, and use a weighted cross-entropy loss to mitigate class imbalance, especially for the underrepresented squamous cell carcinoma category. Our model achieves a Macro F1 Score of 0.80 on the validation set of the Fair Disease Diagnosis Challenge, demonstrating its strong performance in distinguishing between different lung conditions.

Title: Geometrization of Higher-Order Linear Control Laws for Attitude Control on $\mathsf{SO(3)}$
Authors: Farooq Aslam, Hafiz Zeeshan Iqbal Khan, Muhammad Farooq Haydar, Suhail Akhtar, Jamshed Riaz
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework for analyzing the stability of higher-order geometric nonlinear control laws for attitude control on the Special Orthogonal Group $\mathrm{SO(3)}$. In particular, the paper extends existing results on the analysis of PID-type geometric nonlinear control laws to more general higher-order dynamic state-feedback compensators on $\mathrm{SO(3)}$. The candidate Lyapunov function is motivated by quadratic Lyapunov functions of the form $V(x)=x^{\top}Px$ typically considered in the analysis of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. The stability analysis is carried out in two steps. In the first step, a sufficient condition is obtained for the positive definiteness of the candidate Lyapunov function, and a necessary and sufficient condition for the negative definiteness of the corresponding Lyapunov rate. These conditions ensure that the desired equilibrium is almost globally asymptotically stable (AGAS). In the second step, a convex relaxation of the proposed conditions is used to obtain sufficient conditions in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Overall, the approach is motivated by the widespread use of LMI-based analysis and design tools for LTI systems. To reduce conservatism, matrix gains are considered for the controller gains as well as the Lyapunov function coefficients. The applicability of the approach to practical problems is illustrated by designing and analyzing a 21-state geometric nonlinear attitude control law for a multicopter.

Title: MVGBench: Comprehensive Benchmark for Multi-view Generation Models
Authors: Xianghui Xie, Chuhang Zou, Meher Gitika Karumuri, Jan Eric Lenssen, Gerard Pons-Moll
Abstract: We propose MVGBench, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-view image generation models (MVGs) that evaluates 3D consistency in geometry and texture, image quality, and semantics (using vision language models). Recently, MVGs have been the main driving force in 3D object creation. However, existing metrics compare generated images against ground truth target views, which is not suitable for generative tasks where multiple solutions exist while differing from ground truth. Furthermore, different MVGs are trained on different view angles, synthetic data and specific lightings -- robustness to these factors and generalization to real data are rarely evaluated thoroughly. Without a rigorous evaluation protocol, it is also unclear what design choices contribute to the progress of MVGs. MVGBench evaluates three different aspects: best setup performance, generalization to real data and robustness. Instead of comparing against ground truth, we introduce a novel 3D self-consistency metric which compares 3D reconstructions from disjoint generated multi-views. We systematically compare 12 existing MVGs on 4 different curated real and synthetic datasets. With our analysis, we identify important limitations of existing methods specially in terms of robustness and generalization, and we find the most critical design choices. Using the discovered best practices, we propose ViFiGen, a method that outperforms all evaluated MVGs on 3D consistency. Our code, model, and benchmark suite will be publicly released.

Title: Leveraging Unlabeled Audio-Visual Data in Speech Emotion Recognition using Knowledge Distillation
Authors: Varsha Pendyala, Pedro Morgado, William Sethares
Abstract: Voice interfaces integral to the human-computer interaction systems can benefit from speech emotion recognition (SER) to customize responses based on user emotions. Since humans convey emotions through multi-modal audio-visual cues, developing SER systems using both the modalities is beneficial. However, collecting a vast amount of labeled data for their development is expensive. This paper proposes a knowledge distillation framework called LightweightSER (LiSER) that leverages unlabeled audio-visual data for SER, using large teacher models built on advanced speech and face representation models. LiSER transfers knowledge regarding speech emotions and facial expressions from the teacher models to lightweight student models. Experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets, RAVDESS and CREMA-D, demonstrate that LiSER can reduce the dependence on extensive labeled datasets for SER tasks.

Title: Smooth-Distill: A Self-distillation Framework for Multitask Learning with Wearable Sensor Data
Authors: Hoang-Dieu Vu, Duc-Nghia Tran, Quang-Tu Pham, Hieu H. Pham, Nicolas Vuillerme, Duc-Tan Tran
Abstract: This paper introduces Smooth-Distill, a novel self-distillation framework designed to simultaneously perform human activity recognition (HAR) and sensor placement detection using wearable sensor data. The proposed approach utilizes a unified CNN-based architecture, MTL-net, which processes accelerometer data and branches into two outputs for each respective task. Unlike conventional distillation methods that require separate teacher and student models, the proposed framework utilizes a smoothed, historical version of the model itself as the teacher, significantly reducing training computational overhead while maintaining performance benefits. To support this research, we developed a comprehensive accelerometer-based dataset capturing 12 distinct sleep postures across three different wearing positions, complementing two existing public datasets (MHealth and WISDM). Experimental results show that Smooth-Distill consistently outperforms alternative approaches across different evaluation scenarios, achieving notable improvements in both human activity recognition and device placement detection tasks. This method demonstrates enhanced stability in convergence patterns during training and exhibits reduced overfitting compared to traditional multitask learning baselines. This framework contributes to the practical implementation of knowledge distillation in human activity recognition systems, offering an effective solution for multitask learning with accelerometer data that balances accuracy and training efficiency. More broadly, it reduces the computational cost of model training, which is critical for scenarios requiring frequent model updates or training on resource-constrained platforms. The code and model are available at this https URL\_distill.

Title: Enhancing Car-Following Models with Bike Dynamics for Improved Traffic Simulation
Authors: Nico Ostendorf, Keno Garlichs, Lars Wolf
Abstract: Road traffic simulations are crucial for establishing safe and efficient traffic environments. They are used to test various road applications before real-world implementation. SUMO is a well-known simulator for road networks and intermodal traffic, often used in conjunction with other tools to test various types of applications. Realistic simulations require accurate movement models for different road users, such as cars, bicycles, and buses. While realistic models are already implemented for most vehicle types, bicycles, which are essential for achieving safe and efficient traffic, can only be modeled as slow vehicles or fast pedestrians at present. This paper introduces the Realistic Bicycle Dynamics Model (RBDM), the first dedicated bicycle model for SUMO, addressing this significant gap. Leveraging real-world bicycle data from the SimRa dataset, the RBDM implements realistic speed, acceleration, and deceleration behaviors of bicycles in urban scenarios. The evaluation is conducted using the Monaco SUMO traffic scenario and a newly generated Berlin scenario in SUMO. The RBDM significantly outperforms the existing slow-vehicle approximation in SUMO, aligning more closely with real-world data. These results underscore the necessity of a realistic bicycle movement model for accurate simulations, given the significant differences in the movement profiles of bicycles, cars, and pedestrians. Furthermore, the model is tested for its ability to generalize to disparate scenarios and urban topologies, which is dependent on the manner and geographical region in which the SimRa data were gathered. In addition, recommendations are provided for how it could be adapted for use in different city topologies.

Title: Time Invariant Sensor Tasking for Catalog Maintenance of LEO Space objects using Stochastic Geometry
Authors: Partha Chowdhury, Harsha M, Chinni Prabhunath Georg, Arun Balaji Buduru, Sanat K Biswas
Abstract: Catalog maintenance of space objects by limited number of ground-based sensors presents a formidable challenging task to the space community. This article presents a methodology for time-invariant tracking and surveillance of space objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) by optimally directing ground sensors. Our methodology aims to maximize the expected number of space objects from a set of ground stations by utilizing concepts from stochastic geometry, particularly the Poisson point process. We have provided a systematic framework to understand visibility patterns and enhance the efficiency of tracking multiple objects simultaneously. Our approach contributes to more informed decision-making in space operations, ultimately supporting efforts to maintain safety and sustainability in LEO.

Title: Towards transparent and data-driven fault detection in manufacturing: A case study on univariate, discrete time series
Authors: Bernd Hofmann, Patrick Bruendl, Huong Giang Nguyen, Joerg Franke
Abstract: Ensuring consistent product quality in modern manufacturing is crucial, particularly in safety-critical applications. Conventional quality control approaches, reliant on manually defined thresholds and features, lack adaptability to the complexity and variability inherent in production data and necessitate extensive domain expertise. Conversely, data-driven methods, such as machine learning, demonstrate high detection performance but typically function as black-box models, thereby limiting their acceptance in industrial environments where interpretability is paramount. This paper introduces a methodology for industrial fault detection, which is both data-driven and transparent. The approach integrates a supervised machine learning model for multi-class fault classification, Shapley Additive Explanations for post-hoc interpretability, and a do-main-specific visualisation technique that maps model explanations to operator-interpretable features. Furthermore, the study proposes an evaluation methodology that assesses model explanations through quantitative perturbation analysis and evaluates visualisations by qualitative expert assessment. The approach was applied to the crimping process, a safety-critical joining technique, using a dataset of univariate, discrete time series. The system achieves a fault detection accuracy of 95.9 %, and both quantitative selectivity analysis and qualitative expert evaluations confirmed the relevance and inter-pretability of the generated explanations. This human-centric approach is designed to enhance trust and interpretability in data-driven fault detection, thereby contributing to applied system design in industrial quality control.

Abstract: AI-Hybrid TRNG is a deep-learning framework that extracts near-uniform entropy directly from physical noise, eliminating the need for bulky quantum devices or expensive laboratory-grade RF receivers. Instead, it relies on a low-cost, thumb-sized RF front end, plus CPU-timing jitter, for training, and then emits 32-bit high-entropy streams without any quantization step. Unlike deterministic or trained artificial intelligence random number generators (RNGs), our dynamic inner-outer network couples adaptive natural sources and reseeding, yielding truly unpredictable and autonomous sequences. Generated numbers pass the NIST SP 800-22 battery better than a CPU-based method. It also passes nineteen bespoke statistical tests for both bit- and integer-level analysis. All results satisfy cryptographic standards, while forward and backward prediction experiments reveal no exploitable biases. The model's footprint is below 0.5 MB, making it deployable on MCUs and FPGA soft cores, as well as suitable for other resource-constrained platforms. By detaching randomness quality from dedicated hardware, AI-Hybrid TRNG broadens the reach of high-integrity random number generators across secure systems, cryptographic protocols, embedded and edge devices, stochastic simulations, and server applications that need randomness.

Title: A High-Fidelity Speech Super Resolution Network using a Complex Global Attention Module with Spectro-Temporal Loss
Authors: Tarikul Islam Tamiti, Biraj Joshi, Rida Hasan, Rashedul Hasan, Taieba Athay, Nursad Mamun, Anomadarshi Barua
Abstract: Speech super-resolution (SSR) enhances low-resolution speech by increasing the sampling rate. While most SSR methods focus on magnitude reconstruction, recent research highlights the importance of phase reconstruction for improved perceptual quality. Therefore, we introduce CTFT-Net, a Complex Time-Frequency Transformation Network that reconstructs both magnitude and phase in complex domains for improved SSR tasks. It incorporates a complex global attention block to model inter-phoneme and inter-frequency dependencies and a complex conformer to capture long-range and local features, improving frequency reconstruction and noise robustness. CTFT-Net employs time-domain and multi-resolution frequency-domain loss functions for better generalization. Experiments show CTFT-Net outperforms state-of-the-art models (NU-Wave, WSRGlow, NVSR, AERO) on the VCTK dataset, particularly for extreme upsampling (2 kHz to 48 kHz), reconstructing high frequencies effectively without noisy artifacts.

Title: Observation of Blood Flow in Major Neck Vessels Modulated 1 by Physiological Maneuvers
Authors: Gennadi Saiko, Timothy Burton, Faraz Sadrzadeh-Afsharazar, Shota Yamashita, Kenshin Shimono, Yasuyuki Kakihana, Alexandre Douplik
Abstract: Large neck vessels (carotid artery and internal jugular vein, IJV) offer a unique opportunity to monitor hemodynamics non-invasively by optical means. The primary shortcoming of past work has been the focus on healthy volunteers in normal physiological conditions and well-controlled environments. To drive the technology closer to the bedside, testing is required under more re-alistic conditions, including in pathologies and real-world environments (e.g., similar toICU or emergency care settings). The primary goal of the current work was to extend the range of physiological maneuvers for blood flow modulation by introducing new maneuvers and ob-serving PPG response to them. The data from the necks of two healthy volunteers in a supine position were collected by clinical PPG and in-house built PPG sensors, accompanied by ECG signal collection. Seven maneuvers (abdominojugular test, breath holding, Valsalva, proximal occlusion of right IJV, distal occlusion of right IJV, proximal occlusion of left IJV, distal occlusion of left IJV) were performed in sequence with 1 min allocated for each maneuver. The 1 min was split into three segments: baseline (15 s), experiment (15 s), and recovery (30 s). Thus, the overall du-ration of the experiment was 7 min. AC amplitude from clinical PPG, DC amplitudes from in-house built PPG, and ECG signal were compared during all seven physiological maneuvers. Newly proposed maneuvers (Valsalva and IJV occlusions) demonstrated modulation of blood flow, which was more significant than previously reported maneuvers (abdominojugular test and breath holding). The proposed physiological maneuvers demonstrate high potential as instruments for modulating blood flow in major neck vessels.

Title: Robustness Analysis for Quantum Systems Controlled by Continuous-Time Pulses
Authors: Sean Patrick O'Neil, Edmond Jonckheere, Sophie Schirmer
Abstract: Differential sensitivity techniques originally developed to study the robustness of energy landscape controllers are generalized to the important case of closed quantum systems subject to continuously varying controls. Vanishing sensitivity to parameter variation is shown to coincide with perfect fidelity, as was the case for time-invariant controls. Bounds on the magnitude of the differential sensitivity to any parameter variation are derived based simply on knowledge of the system Hamiltonian and the maximum size of the control inputs

Title: Control-Optimized Deep Reinforcement Learning for Artificially Intelligent Autonomous Systems
Authors: Oren Fivel, Matan Rudman, Kobi Cohen
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a powerful tool for complex decision-making in machine learning and AI. However, traditional methods often assume perfect action execution, overlooking the uncertainties and deviations between an agent's selected actions and the actual system response. In real-world applications, such as robotics, mechatronics, and communication networks, execution mismatches arising from system dynamics, hardware constraints, and latency can significantly degrade performance. This work advances AI by developing a novel control-optimized DRL framework that explicitly models and compensates for action execution mismatches, a challenge largely overlooked in existing methods. Our approach establishes a structured two-stage process: determining the desired action and selecting the appropriate control signal to ensure proper execution. It trains the agent while accounting for action mismatches and controller corrections. By incorporating these factors into the training process, the AI agent optimizes the desired action with respect to both the actual control signal and the intended outcome, explicitly considering execution errors. This approach enhances robustness, ensuring that decision-making remains effective under real-world uncertainties. Our approach offers a substantial advancement for engineering practice by bridging the gap between idealized learning and real-world implementation. It equips intelligent agents operating in engineering environments with the ability to anticipate and adjust for actuation errors and system disturbances during training. We evaluate the framework in five widely used open-source mechanical simulation environments we restructured and developed to reflect real-world operating conditions, showcasing its robustness against uncertainties and offering a highly practical and efficient solution for control-oriented applications.

Title: $μ^2$Tokenizer: Differentiable Multi-Scale Multi-Modal Tokenizer for Radiology Report Generation
Authors: Siyou Li, Pengyao Qin, Huanan Wu, Dong Nie, Arun J. Thirunavukarasu, Juntao Yu, Le Zhang
Abstract: Automated radiology report generation (RRG) aims to produce detailed textual reports from clinical imaging, such as computed tomography (CT) scans, to improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis and provision of management advice. RRG is complicated by two key challenges: (1) inherent complexity in extracting relevant information from imaging data under resource constraints, and (2) difficulty in objectively evaluating discrepancies between model-generated and expert-written reports. To address these challenges, we propose $\mu^2$LLM, a $\underline{\textbf{mu}}$ltiscale $\underline{\textbf{mu}}$ltimodal large language models for RRG tasks. The novel ${\mu}^2$Tokenizer, as an intermediate layer, integrates multi-modal features from the multiscale visual tokenizer and the text tokenizer, then enhances report generation quality through direct preference optimization (DPO), guided by GREEN-RedLlama. Experimental results on four large CT image-report medical datasetdemonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, highlighting the potential of our fine-tuned $\mu^2$LLMs on limited data for RRG tasks.

Title: Scope Meets Screen: Lessons Learned in Designing Composite Visualizations for Marksmanship Training Across Skill Levels
Authors: Emin Zerman, Jonas Carlsson, Mårten Sjöström
Abstract: Marksmanship practices are required in various professions, including police, military personnel, hunters, as well as sports shooters, such as Olympic shooting, biathlon, and modern pentathlon. The current form of training and coaching is mostly based on repetition, where the coach does not see through the eyes of the shooter, and analysis is limited to stance and accuracy post-session. In this study, we present a shooting visualization system and evaluate its perceived effectiveness for both novice and expert shooters. To achieve this, five composite visualizations were developed using first-person shooting video recordings enriched with overlaid metrics and graphical summaries. These views were evaluated with 10 participants (5 expert marksmen, 5 novices) through a mixed-methods study including shot-count and aiming interpretation tasks, pairwise preference comparisons, and semi-structured interviews. The results show that a dashboard-style composite view, combining raw video with a polar plot and selected graphs, was preferred in 9 of 10 cases and supported understanding across skill levels. The insights gained from this design study point to the broader value of integrating first-person video with visual analytics for coaching, and we suggest directions for applying this approach to other precision-based sports.

Title: Data-Driven Exploration for a Class of Continuous-Time Linear--Quadratic Reinforcement Learning Problems
Authors: Yilie Huang, Xun Yu Zhou
Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) for the same class of continuous-time stochastic linear--quadratic (LQ) control problems as in \cite{huang2024sublinear}, where volatilities depend on both states and controls while states are scalar-valued and running control rewards are absent. We propose a model-free, data-driven exploration mechanism that adaptively adjusts entropy regularization by the critic and policy variance by the actor. Unlike the constant or deterministic exploration schedules employed in \cite{huang2024sublinear}, which require extensive tuning for implementations and ignore learning progresses during iterations, our adaptive exploratory approach boosts learning efficiency with minimal tuning. Despite its flexibility, our method achieves a sublinear regret bound that matches the best-known model-free results for this class of LQ problems, which were previously derived only with fixed exploration schedules. Numerical experiments demonstrate that adaptive explorations accelerate convergence and improve regret performance compared to the non-adaptive model-free and model-based counterparts.

Title: An Improved U-Net Model for Offline handwriting signature denoising
Authors: Wanghui Xiao
Abstract: Handwriting signatures, as an important means of identity recognition, are widely used in multiple fields such as financial transactions, commercial contracts and personal affairs due to their legal effect and uniqueness. In forensic science appraisals, the analysis of offline handwriting signatures requires the appraiser to provide a certain number of signature samples, which are usually derived from various historical contracts or archival materials. However, the provided handwriting samples are often mixed with a large amount of interfering information, which brings severe challenges to handwriting identification work. This study proposes a signature handwriting denoising model based on the improved U-net structure, aiming to enhance the robustness of the signature recognition system. By introducing discrete wavelet transform and PCA transform, the model's ability to suppress noise has been enhanced. The experimental results show that this modelis significantly superior to the traditional methods in denoising effect, can effectively improve the clarity and readability of the signed images, and provide more reliable technical support for signature analysis and recognition.

Title: Wireless AI Evolution: From Statistical Learners to Electromagnetic-Guided Foundation Models
Authors: Jian Xiao, Ji Wang, Kunrui Cao, Xingwang Li, Zhao Chen, Chau Yuen
Abstract: While initial applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in wireless communications over the past decade have demonstrated considerable potential using specialized models for targeted communication tasks, the revolutionary demands of sixth-generation (6G) networks for holographic communications, ubiquitous sensing, and native intelligence are propelling a necessary evolution towards AI-native wireless networks. The arrival of large AI models paves the way for the next phase of Wireless AI, driven by wireless foundation models (WFMs). In particular, pre-training on universal electromagnetic (EM) principles equips WFMs with the essential adaptability for a multitude of demanding 6G applications. However, existing large AI models face critical limitations, including pre-training strategies disconnected from EM-compliant constraints leading to physically inconsistent predictions, a lack of embedded understanding of wave propagation physics, and the inaccessibility of massive labeled datasets for comprehensive EM-aware training. To address these challenges, this article presents an electromagnetic information theory-guided self-supervised pre-training (EIT-SPT) framework designed to systematically inject EM physics into WFMs. The EIT-SPT framework aims to infuse WFMs with intrinsic EM knowledge, thereby enhancing their physical consistency, generalization capabilities across varied EM landscapes, and overall data efficiency. Building upon the proposed EIT-SPT framework, this article first elaborates on diverse potential applications in 6G scenarios of WFMs, then validates the efficacy of the proposed framework through illustrative case studies, and finally summarizes critical open research challenges and future directions for WFMs.

Title: Efficient Depth- and Spatially-Varying Image Simulation for Defocus Deblur
Authors: Xinge Yang, Chuong Nguyen, Wenbin Wang, Kaizhang Kang, Wolfgang Heidrich, Xiaoxing Li
Abstract: Modern cameras with large apertures often suffer from a shallow depth of field, resulting in blurry images of objects outside the focal plane. This limitation is particularly problematic for fixed-focus cameras, such as those used in smart glasses, where adding autofocus mechanisms is challenging due to form factor and power constraints. Due to unmatched optical aberrations and defocus properties unique to each camera system, deep learning models trained on existing open-source datasets often face domain gaps and do not perform well in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose an efficient and scalable dataset synthesis approach that does not rely on fine-tuning with real-world data. Our method simultaneously models depth-dependent defocus and spatially varying optical aberrations, addressing both computational complexity and the scarcity of high-quality RGB-D datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that a network trained on our low resolution synthetic images generalizes effectively to high resolution (12MP) real-world images across diverse scenes.

Title: Customizable ROI-Based Deep Image Compression
Authors: Ian Jin, Fanxin Xia, Feng Ding, Xinfeng Zhang, Meiqin Liu, Yao Zhao, Weisi Lin, Lili Meng
Abstract: Region of Interest (ROI)-based image compression optimizes bit allocation by prioritizing ROI for higher-quality reconstruction. However, as the users (including human clients and downstream machine tasks) become more diverse, ROI-based image compression needs to be customizable to support various preferences. For example, different users may define distinct ROI or require different quality trade-offs between ROI and non-ROI. Existing ROI-based image compression schemes predefine the ROI, making it unchangeable, and lack effective mechanisms to balance reconstruction quality between ROI and non-ROI. This work proposes a paradigm for customizable ROI-based deep image compression. First, we develop a Text-controlled Mask Acquisition (TMA) module, which allows users to easily customize their ROI for compression by just inputting the corresponding semantic \emph{text}. It makes the encoder controlled by text. Second, we design a Customizable Value Assign (CVA) mechanism, which masks the non-ROI with a changeable extent decided by users instead of a constant one to manage the reconstruction quality trade-off between ROI and non-ROI. Finally, we present a Latent Mask Attention (LMA) module, where the latent spatial prior of the mask and the latent Rate-Distortion Optimization (RDO) prior of the image are extracted and fused in the latent space, and further used to optimize the latent representation of the source image. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed customizable ROI-based deep image compression paradigm effectively addresses the needs of customization for ROI definition and mask acquisition as well as the reconstruction quality trade-off management between the ROI and non-ROI.

Title: Accuracy and Security-Guaranteed Participant Selection and Beamforming Design for RIS-Assisted Federated Learning
Authors: Mengru Wu, Yu Gao, Weidang Lu, Huimei Han, Lei Sun, Wanli Ni
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as an effective approach for training neural network models without requiring the sharing of participants' raw data, thereby addressing data privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted FL framework in the presence of eavesdropping, where partial edge devices are selected to participate in the FL training process. In contrast, the remaining devices serve as cooperative jammers by transmitting jamming signals to disrupt eavesdropping. We aim to minimize the training latency in each FL round by jointly optimizing participant selection, bandwidth allocation, and RIS beamforming design, subject to the convergence accuracy of FL and the secure uploading requirements. To solve the resulting mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, we propose a twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme reduces the FL training latency by approximately 27$\%$ compared to baselines.

Title: Latent Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow for Higher-Fidelity Perceptual Face Restoration
Authors: Xin Luo, Menglin Zhang, Yunwei Lan, Tianyu Zhang, Rui Li, Chang Liu, Dong Liu
Abstract: The Perception-Distortion tradeoff (PD-tradeoff) theory suggests that face restoration algorithms must balance perceptual quality and fidelity. To achieve minimal distortion while maintaining perfect perceptual quality, Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF) proposes a flow based approach where source distribution is minimum distortion estimations. Although PMRF is shown to be effective, its pixel-space modeling approach limits its ability to align with human perception, where human perception is defined as how humans distinguish between two image distributions. In this work, we propose Latent-PMRF, which reformulates PMRF in the latent space of a variational autoencoder (VAE), facilitating better alignment with human perception during optimization. By defining the source distribution on latent representations of minimum distortion estimation, we bound the minimum distortion by the VAE's reconstruction error. Moreover, we reveal the design of VAE is crucial, and our proposed VAE significantly outperforms existing VAEs in both reconstruction and restoration. Extensive experiments on blind face restoration demonstrate the superiority of Latent-PMRF, offering an improved PD-tradeoff compared to existing methods, along with remarkable convergence efficiency, achieving a 5.79X speedup over PMRF in terms of FID. Our code will be available as open-source.

Title: Beat and Downbeat Tracking in Performance MIDI Using an End-to-End Transformer Architecture
Authors: Sebastian Murgul, Michael Heizmann
Abstract: Beat tracking in musical performance MIDI is a challenging and important task for notation-level music transcription and rhythmical analysis, yet existing methods primarily focus on audio-based approaches. This paper proposes an end-to-end transformer-based model for beat and downbeat tracking in performance MIDI, leveraging an encoder-decoder architecture for sequence-to-sequence translation of MIDI input to beat annotations. Our approach introduces novel data preprocessing techniques, including dynamic augmentation and optimized tokenization strategies, to improve accuracy and generalizability across different datasets. We conduct extensive experiments using the A-MAPS, ASAP, GuitarSet, and Leduc datasets, comparing our model against state-of-the-art hidden Markov models (HMMs) and deep learning-based beat tracking methods. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms existing symbolic music beat tracking approaches, achieving competitive F1-scores across various musical styles and instruments. Our findings highlight the potential of transformer architectures for symbolic beat tracking and suggest future integration with automatic music transcription systems for enhanced music analysis and score generation.

Title: AudioBERTScore: Objective Evaluation of Environmental Sound Synthesis Based on Similarity of Audio embedding Sequences
Authors: Minoru Kishi, Ryosuke Sakai, Shinnosuke Takamichi, Yusuke Kanamori, Yuki Okamoto
Abstract: We propose a novel objective evaluation metric for synthesized audio in text-to-audio (TTA), aiming to improve the performance of TTA models. In TTA, subjective evaluation of the synthesized sound is an important, but its implementation requires monetary costs. Therefore, objective evaluation such as mel-cepstral distortion are used, but the correlation between these objective metrics and subjective evaluation values is weak. Our proposed objective evaluation metric, AudioBERTScore, calculates the similarity between embedding of the synthesized and reference sounds. The method is based not only on the max-norm used in conventional BERTScore but also on the $p$-norm to reflect the non-local nature of environmental sounds. Experimental results show that scores obtained by the proposed method have a higher correlation with subjective evaluation values than conventional metrics.

Title: Just Noticeable Difference for Large Multimodal Models
Authors: Zijian Chen, Yuan Tian, Yuze Sun, Wei Sun, Zicheng Zhang, Weisi Lin, Guangtao Zhai, Wenjun Zhang
Abstract: Just noticeable difference (JND), the minimum change that the human visual system (HVS) can perceive, has been studied for decades. Although recent work has extended this line of research into machine vision, there has been a scarcity of studies systematically exploring its perceptual boundaries across multiple tasks and stimulus types, particularly in the current era of rapidly advancing large multimodal models (LMMs), where studying the multifaceted capabilities of models has become a mainstream focus. Moreover, the perceptual defects of LMMs are not investigated thoroughly, resulting in potential security issues and suboptimal response efficiency. In this paper, we take an initial attempt and demonstrate that there exist significant visual blind spots in current LMMs. To systemically quantify this characteristic, we propose a new concept, {\bf LMM-JND}, together with its determination pipeline. Targeting uncovering the behavior commonalities in HVS-aligned visual perception tasks, we delve into several LMM families and construct a large-scale dataset, named VPA-JND, which contains 21.5k reference images with over 489k stimuli across 12 distortion types, to facilitate LMM-JND studies. VPA-JND exposes areas where state-of-the-art LMMs, including GPT-4o and the InternVL2.5 series, struggle with basic comparison queries and fall significantly short of human-level visual performance. We further explore the effects of vision and language backbones and find a notable correlation between their design philosophy that may instruct the future refinement of LMMs for their visual acuity. Together, our research underscores the significance of LMM-JND as a unique perspective for studying LMMs, and predictable LMM-JND is crucial for security concerns.

Title: MuteSwap: Silent Face-based Voice Conversion
Authors: Yifan Liu, Yu Fang, Zhouhan Lin
Abstract: Conventional voice conversion modifies voice characteristics from a source speaker to a target speaker, relying on audio input from both sides. However, this process becomes infeasible when clean audio is unavailable, such as in silent videos or noisy environments. In this work, we focus on the task of Silent Face-based Voice Conversion (SFVC), which does voice conversion entirely from visual inputs. i.e., given images of a target speaker and a silent video of a source speaker containing lip motion, SFVC generates speech aligning the identity of the target speaker while preserving the speech content in the source silent video. As this task requires generating intelligible speech and converting identity using only visual cues, it is particularly challenging. To address this, we introduce MuteSwap, a novel framework that employs contrastive learning to align cross-modality identities and minimize mutual information to separate shared visual features. Experimental results show that MuteSwap achieves impressive performance in both speech synthesis and identity conversion, especially under noisy conditions where methods dependent on audio input fail to produce intelligible results, demonstrating both the effectiveness of our training approach and the feasibility of SFVC.

Title: Cyber Attacks Detection, Prevention, and Source Localization in Digital Substation Communication using Hybrid Statistical-Deep Learning
Authors: Nicola Cibin, Bas Mulder, Herman Carstens, Peter Palensky, Alexandru Ştefanov
Abstract: The digital transformation of power systems is accelerating the adoption of IEC 61850 standard. However, its communication protocols, including Sampled Values (SV), lack built-in security features such as authentication and encryption, making them vulnerable to malicious packet injection. Such cyber attacks can delay fault clearance or trigger unintended circuit breaker operations. While most existing research focuses on detecting cyber attacks in digital substations, intrusion prevention systems have been disregarded because of the risk of potential communication network disruptions. This paper proposes a novel method using hybrid statistical-deep learning for the detection, prevention, and source localization of IEC 61850 SV injection attacks. The method uses exponentially modified Gaussian distributions to model communication network latency and long short-term memory and Elman recurrent neural network to detect anomalous variations in the estimated probability distributions. It effectively discards malicious SV frames with minimal processing overhead and latency, maintains robustness against communication network latency variation and time-synchronization issues, and guarantees a near-zero false positive rate in non-attack scenarios. Comprehensive validation is conducted on three testbeds involving industrial-grade devices, hardware-in-the-loop simulations, virtualized intelligent electronic devices and merging units, and high-fidelity emulated communication networks. Results demonstrate the method's suitability for practical deployment in IEC 61850-compliant digital substations.

Title: Neural Augmented Kalman Filters for Road Network assisted GNSS positioning
Authors: Hans van Gorp, Davide Belli, Amir Jalalirad, Bence Major
Abstract: The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) provides critical positioning information globally, but its accuracy in dense urban environments is often compromised by multipath and non-line-of-sight errors. Road network data can be used to reduce the impact of these errors and enhance the accuracy of a positioning system. Previous works employing road network data are either limited to offline applications, or rely on Kalman Filter (KF) heuristics with little flexibility and robustness. We instead propose training a Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGNN) to integrate road network information into a KF. The TGNN is designed to predict the correct road segment and its associated uncertainty to be used in the measurement update step of the KF. We validate our approach with real-world GNSS data and open-source road networks, observing a 29% decrease in positioning error for challenging scenarios compared to a GNSS-only KF. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first deep learning-based approach jointly employing road network data and GNSS measurements to determine the user position on Earth.

Authors: Yifan Gao, Jiao Fu, Long Guo, Hong Liu
Abstract: Early identification of suicide risk is crucial for preventing suicidal behaviors. As a result, the identification and study of patterns and markers related to suicide risk have become a key focus of current research. In this paper, we present the results of our work in the 1st SpeechWellness Challenge (SW1), which aims to explore speech as a non-invasive and easily accessible mental health indicator for identifying adolescents at risk of this http URL approach leverages large language model (LLM) as the primary tool for feature extraction, alongside conventional acoustic and semantic features. The proposed method achieves an accuracy of 74\% on the test set, ranking first in the SW1 challenge. These findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-based methods for analyzing speech in the context of suicide risk assessment.

Title: A Test-Function Approach to Incremental Stability
Authors: Daniel Pfrommer, Max Simchowitz, Ali Jadbabaie
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for analyzing Incremental-Input-to-State Stability ($\delta$ISS) based on the idea of using rewards as "test functions." Whereas control theory traditionally deals with Lyapunov functions that satisfy a time-decrease condition, reinforcement learning (RL) value functions are constructed by exponentially decaying a Lipschitz reward function that may be non-smooth and unbounded on both sides. Thus, these RL-style value functions cannot be directly understood as Lyapunov certificates. We develop a new equivalence between a variant of incremental input-to-state stability of a closed-loop system under given a policy, and the regularity of RL-style value functions under adversarial selection of a Hölder-continuous reward function. This result highlights that the regularity of value functions, and their connection to incremental stability, can be understood in a way that is distinct from the traditional Lyapunov-based approach to certifying stability in control theory.

Title: Biorthogonal Tunable Wavelet Unit with Lifting Scheme in Convolutional Neural Network
Authors: An Le, Hung Nguyen, Sungbal Seo, You-Suk Bae, Truong Nguyen
Abstract: This work introduces a novel biorthogonal tunable wavelet unit constructed using a lifting scheme that relaxes both the orthogonality and equal filter length constraints, providing greater flexibility in filter design. The proposed unit enhances convolution, pooling, and downsampling operations, leading to improved image classification and anomaly detection in convolutional neural networks (CNN). When integrated into an 18-layer residual neural network (ResNet-18), the approach improved classification accuracy on CIFAR-10 by 2.12% and on the Describable Textures Dataset (DTD) by 9.73%, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing fine-grained details. Similar improvements were observed in ResNet-34. For anomaly detection in the hazelnut category of the MVTec Anomaly Detection dataset, the proposed method achieved competitive and wellbalanced performance in both segmentation and detection tasks, outperforming existing approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness.

Title: Multi-interaction TTS toward professional recording reproduction
Authors: Hiroki Kanagawa, Kenichi Fujita, Aya Watanabe, Yusuke Ijima
Abstract: Voice directors often iteratively refine voice actors' performances by providing feedback to achieve the desired outcome. While this iterative feedback-based refinement process is important in actual recordings, it has been overlooked in text-to-speech synthesis (TTS). As a result, fine-grained style refinement after the initial synthesis is not possible, even though the synthesized speech often deviates from the user's intended style. To address this issue, we propose a TTS method with multi-step interaction that allows users to intuitively and rapidly refine synthetized speech. Our approach models the interaction between the TTS model and its user to emulate the relationship between voice actors and voice directors. Experiments show that the proposed model with its corresponding dataset enable iterative style refinements in accordance with users' directions, thus demonstrating its multi-interaction capability.

Title: Ranking Quantilized Mean-Field Games with an Application to Early-Stage Venture Investments
Authors: Rinel Foguen Tchuendom, Dena Firoozi, Michèle Breton
Abstract: Quantilized mean-field game models involve quantiles of the population's distribution. We study a class of such games with a capacity for ranking games, where the performance of each agent is evaluated based on its terminal state relative to the population's $\alpha$-quantile value, $\alpha \in (0,1)$. This evaluation criterion is designed to select the top $(1-\alpha)\%$ performing agents. We provide two formulations for this competition: a target-based formulation and a threshold-based formulation. In the former and latter formulations, to satisfy the selection condition, each agent aims for its terminal state to be \textit{exactly} equal and \textit{at least} equal to the population's $\alpha$-quantile value, respectively. For the target-based formulation, we obtain an analytic solution and demonstrate the $\epsilon$-Nash property for the asymptotic best-response strategies in the $N$-player game. Specifically, the quantilized mean-field consistency condition is expressed as a set of forward-backward ordinary differential equations, characterizing the $\alpha$-quantile value at equilibrium. For the threshold-based formulation, we obtain a semi-explicit solution and numerically solve the resulting quantilized mean-field consistency condition. Subsequently, we propose a new application in the context of early-stage venture investments, where a venture capital firm financially supports a group of start-up companies engaged in a competition over a finite time horizon, with the goal of selecting a percentage of top-ranking ones to receive the next round of funding at the end of the time horizon. We present the results and interpretations of numerical experiments for both formulations discussed in this context and show that the target-based formulation provides a very good approximation for the threshold-based formulation.

Title: Enhancing Vehicular Platooning with Wireless Federated Learning: A Resource-Aware Control Framework
Authors: Beining Wu, Jun Huang, Qiang Duan, Liang Dong, Zhipeng Cai
Abstract: This paper aims to enhance the performance of Vehicular Platooning (VP) systems integrated with Wireless Federated Learning (WFL). In highly dynamic environments, vehicular platoons experience frequent communication changes and resource constraints, which significantly affect information exchange and learning model synchronization. To address these challenges, we first formulate WFL in VP as a joint optimization problem that simultaneously considers Age of Information (AoI) and Federated Learning Model Drift (FLMD) to ensure timely and accurate control. Through theoretical analysis, we examine the impact of FLMD on convergence performance and develop a two-stage Resource-Aware Control framework (RACE). The first stage employs a Lagrangian dual decomposition method for resource configuration, while the second stage implements a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning approach for vehicle selection. The approach integrates Multi-Head Self-Attention and Long Short-Term Memory networks to capture spatiotemporal correlations in communication states. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to baseline methods, the proposed framework improves AoI optimization by up to 45%, accelerates learning convergence, and adapts more effectively to dynamic VP environments on the AI4MARS dataset.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is fueling exponential electricity demand growth, threatening grid reliability, raising prices for communities paying for new energy infrastructure, and stunting AI innovation as data centers wait for interconnection to constrained grids. This paper presents the first field demonstration, in collaboration with major corporate partners, of a software-only approach--Emerald Conductor--that transforms AI data centers into flexible grid resources that can efficiently and immediately harness existing power systems without massive infrastructure buildout. Conducted at a 256-GPU cluster running representative AI workloads within a commercial, hyperscale cloud data center in Phoenix, Arizona, the trial achieved a 25% reduction in cluster power usage for three hours during peak grid events while maintaining AI quality of service (QoS) guarantees. By orchestrating AI workloads based on real-time grid signals without hardware modifications or energy storage, this platform reimagines data centers as grid-interactive assets that enhance grid reliability, advance affordability, and accelerate AI's development.

Title: Privacy-Preserving Quantized Federated Learning with Diverse Precision
Authors: Dang Qua Nguyen, Morteza Hashemi, Erik Perrins, Sergiy A. Vorobyov, David J. Love, Taejoon Kim
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for distributed machine learning, enabling collaborative training of a global model across multiple local devices without requiring them to share raw data. Despite its advancements, FL is limited by factors such as: (i) privacy risks arising from the unprotected transmission of local model updates to the fusion center (FC) and (ii) decreased learning utility caused by heterogeneity in model quantization resolution across participating devices. Prior work typically addresses only one of these challenges because maintaining learning utility under both privacy risks and quantization heterogeneity is a non-trivial task. In this paper, our aim is therefore to improve the learning utility of a privacy-preserving FL that allows clusters of devices with different quantization resolutions to participate in each FL round. Specifically, we introduce a novel stochastic quantizer (SQ) that is designed to simultaneously achieve differential privacy (DP) and minimum quantization error. Notably, the proposed SQ guarantees bounded distortion, unlike other DP approaches. To address quantization heterogeneity, we introduce a cluster size optimization technique combined with a linear fusion approach to enhance model aggregation accuracy. Numerical simulations validate the benefits of our approach in terms of privacy protection and learning utility compared to the conventional LaplaceSQ-FL algorithm.

Title: MambAttention: Mamba with Multi-Head Attention for Generalizable Single-Channel Speech Enhancement
Authors: Nikolai Lund Kühne, Jesper Jensen, Jan Østergaard, Zheng-Hua Tan
Abstract: With the advent of new sequence models like Mamba and xLSTM, several studies have shown that these models match or outperform state-of-the-art models in single-channel speech enhancement, automatic speech recognition, and self-supervised audio representation learning. However, prior research has demonstrated that sequence models like LSTM and Mamba tend to overfit to the training set. To address this issue, previous works have shown that adding self-attention to LSTMs substantially improves generalization performance for single-channel speech enhancement. Nevertheless, neither the concept of hybrid Mamba and time-frequency attention models nor their generalization performance have been explored for speech enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid architecture, MambAttention, which combines Mamba and shared time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalizable single-channel speech enhancement. To train our model, we introduce VoiceBank+Demand Extended (VB-DemandEx), a dataset inspired by VoiceBank+Demand but with more challenging noise types and lower signal-to-noise ratios. Trained on VB-DemandEx, our proposed MambAttention model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art LSTM-, xLSTM-, Mamba-, and Conformer-based systems of similar complexity across all reported metrics on two out-of-domain datasets: DNS 2020 and EARS-WHAM_v2, while matching their performance on the in-domain dataset VB-DemandEx. Ablation studies highlight the role of weight sharing between the time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalization performance. Finally, we explore integrating the shared time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules with LSTM and xLSTM, which yields a notable performance improvement on the out-of-domain datasets. However, our MambAttention model remains superior on both out-of-domain datasets across all reported evaluation metrics.

Title: Adaptive Modified RISE Control for Quadrotors: Enhancing Trajectory Tracking Through Uncertainty Compensation
Authors: Kevin Johnston, Musabbir Ahmed Arrafi, Krishna B Kidambi, Madhur Tiwari
Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive modified Robust Inverse of Signum Error (AM-RISE) control method, which achieves reliable trajectory tracking control for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle. The proposed method systematically accounts for gyroscopic effects, rotor dynamics, parametric uncertainties, and external disturbances, ensuring robust performance across varying trajectory speeds. Through novel mathematical manipulation in the error system development, the quadrotor dynamics are expressed in a control-oriented form, which explicitly incorporates the uncertainty in the gyroscopic term and control actuation term. An adaptive modified RISE law is then designed to stabilize both the position and attitude loops of the quadrotor system. A rigorous Lyapunov-based analysis is utilized to prove asymptotic trajectory tracking, where the region of convergence can be made arbitrarily large through judicious control gain selection. Moreover, the stability analysis formally addresses gyroscopic effects and actuator uncertainty. To illustrate the performance of the control law, comparative numerical simulation results are provided, which demonstrate the improved closed-loop performance achieved under varying levels of parametric uncertainty, disturbance magnitudes and trajectory speeds.

Title: Identifying Systems with Symmetries using Equivariant Autoregressive Reservoir Computers
Authors: Fredy Vides, Idelfonso B. R. Nogueira, Gabriela Lopez Gutierrez, Lendy Banegas, Evelyn Flores
Abstract: The investigation reported in this document focuses on identifying systems with symmetries using equivariant autoregressive reservoir computers. General results in structured matrix approximation theory are presented, exploring a two-fold approach. Firstly, a comprehensive examination of generic symmetry-preserving nonlinear time delay embedding is conducted. This involves analyzing time series data sampled from an equivariant system under study. Secondly, sparse least-squares methods are applied to discern approximate representations of the output coupling matrices. These matrices play a critical role in determining the nonlinear autoregressive representation of an equivariant system. The structural characteristics of these matrices are dictated by the set of symmetries inherent in the system. The document outlines prototypical algorithms derived from the described techniques, offering insight into their practical applications. Emphasis is placed on the significant improvement on structured identification precision when compared to classical reservoir computing methods for the simulation of equivariant dynamical systems.

Title: Robust Correlated Equilibrium: Definition and Computation
Authors: Rahul Misra, Rafał Wisniewski, Carsten Skovmose Kallesøe, Manuela L. Bujorianu
Abstract: We study N-player finite games with costs perturbed due to time-varying disturbances in the underlying system and to that end, we propose the concept of Robust Correlated Equilibrium that generalizes the definition of Correlated Equilibrium. Conditions under which the Robust Correlated Equilibrium exists are specified, and a decentralized algorithm for learning strategies that are optimal in the sense of Robust Correlated Equilibrium is proposed. The primary contribution of the paper is the convergence analysis of the algorithm and to that end, we propose a modification of the celebrated Blackwell's Approachability theorem to games with costs that are not just time-average, as in the original Blackwell's Approachability Theorem, but also include the time-average of previous algorithm iterates. The designed algorithm is applied to a practical water distribution network with pumps being the controllers and their costs being perturbed by uncertain consumption due to the consumers. Simulation results show that each controller achieves no regret, and empirical distributions converge to the Robust Correlated Equilibrium.

Title: Realism in Action: Anomaly-Aware Diagnosis of Brain Tumors from Medical Images Using YOLOv8 and DeiT
Authors: Seyed Mohammad Hossein Hashemi, Leila Safari, Mohsen Hooshmand, Amirhossein Dadashzadeh Taromi
Abstract: Reliable diagnosis of brain tumors remains challenging due to low clinical incidence rates of such cases. However, this low rate is neglected in most of proposed methods. We propose a clinically inspired framework for anomaly-resilient tumor detection and classification. Detection leverages YOLOv8n fine-tuned on a realistically imbalanced dataset (1:9 tumor-to-normal ratio; 30,000 MRI slices from 81 patients). In addition, we propose a novel Patient-to-Patient (PTP) metric that evaluates diagnostic reliability at the patient level. Classification employs knowledge distillation: a Data Efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) student model is distilled from a ResNet152 teacher. The distilled ViT achieves an F1-score of 0.92 within 20 epochs, matching near teacher performance (F1=0.97) with significantly reduced computational resources. This end-to-end framework demonstrates high robustness in clinically representative anomaly-distributed data, offering a viable tool that adheres to realistic situations in clinics.

Title: De-LightSAM: Modality-Decoupled Lightweight SAM for Generalizable Medical Segmentation
Authors: Qing Xu, Jiaxuan Li, Xiangjian He, Chenxin Li, Fiseha B. Tesem, Wenting Duan, Zhen Chen, Rong Qu, Jonathan M. Garibaldi, Chang Wen Chen
Abstract: The universality of deep neural networks across different modalities and their generalization capabilities to unseen domains play an essential role in medical image segmentation. The recent segment anything model (SAM) has demonstrated strong adaptability across diverse natural scenarios. However, the huge computational costs, demand for manual annotations as prompts and conflict-prone decoding process of SAM degrade its generalization capabilities in medical scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a modality-decoupled lightweight SAM for domain-generalized medical image segmentation, named De-LightSAM. Specifically, we first devise a lightweight domain-controllable image encoder (DC-Encoder) that produces discriminative visual features for diverse modalities. Further, we introduce the self-patch prompt generator (SP-Generator) to automatically generate high-quality dense prompt embeddings for guiding segmentation decoding. Finally, we design the query-decoupled modality decoder (QM-Decoder) that leverages a one-to-one strategy to provide an independent decoding channel for every modality, preventing mutual knowledge interference of different modalities. Moreover, we design a multi-modal decoupled knowledge distillation (MDKD) strategy to leverage robust common knowledge to complement domain-specific medical feature representations. Extensive experiments indicate that De-LightSAM outperforms state-of-the-arts in diverse medical imaging segmentation tasks, displaying superior modality universality and generalization capabilities. Especially, De-LightSAM uses only 2.0% parameters compared to SAM-H. The source code is available at this https URL.

Title: Downscaling Neural Network for Coastal Simulations
Authors: Zhi-Song Liu, Markus Buttner, Vadym Aizinger, Andreas Rupp
Abstract: Learning the fine-scale details of a coastal ocean simulation from a coarse representation is a challenging task. For real-world applications, high-resolution simulations are necessary to advance understanding of many coastal processes, specifically, to predict flooding resulting from tsunamis and storm surges. We propose a Downscaling Neural Network for Coastal Simulation (DNNCS) for spatiotemporal enhancement to efficiently learn the high-resolution numerical solution. Given images of coastal simulations produced on low-resolution computational meshes using low polynomial order discontinuous Galerkin discretizations and a coarse temporal resolution, the proposed DNNCS learns to produce high-resolution free surface elevation and velocity visualizations in both time and space. To efficiently model the dynamic changes over time and space, we propose grid-aware spatiotemporal attention to project the temporal features to the spatial domain for non-local feature matching. The coordinate information is also utilized via positional encoding. For the final reconstruction, we use the spatiotemporal bilinear operation to interpolate the missing frames and then expand the feature maps to the frequency domain for residual mapping. Besides data-driven losses, the proposed physics-informed loss guarantees gradient consistency and momentum changes. Their combination contributes to the overall 24% improvements in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). To train the proposed model, we propose a novel coastal simulation dataset and use it for model optimization and evaluation. Our method shows superior downscaling quality and fast computation compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Thévenin Equivalent Parameters Identification Based on Statistical Characteristics of System Ambient Data
Authors: Boying Zhou, Chen Shen, Kexuan Tang
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method for identifying Thévenin equivalent parameters (TEP) in power system, based on the statistical characteristics of the system's stochastic response. The method leverages stochastic fluctuation data under steady-state grid conditions and applies sliding window techniques to compute sensitivity parameters between voltage magnitude, current magnitude and power. This enables high-accuracy and robust TEP identification. In contrast to traditional methods, the proposed approach does not rely on large disturbances or probing signals but instead utilizes the natural fluctuation behavior of the system. Additionally, the method supports distributed implementation using local measurements of voltage magnitude, current magnitude, and power, offering significant practical value for engineering applications. The theoretical analysis demonstrates the method's robustness in the presence of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), asynchronous measurements, and data collinearity issues. Simulation results further confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in diverse practical scenarios, demonstrating its ability to consistently provide accurate and reliable identification of TEP using system ambient data.

Title: Disturbance-Adaptive Data-Driven Predictive Control: Trading Comfort Violations for Savings in Building Climate Control
Authors: Jicheng Shi, Christophe Salzmann, Colin N. Jones
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) has demonstrated significant potential in improving energy efficiency in building climate control, outperforming traditional controllers commonly used in modern building management systems. Among MPC variants, Data-driven Predictive Control (DPC) offers the advantage of modeling building dynamics directly from data, thereby substantially reducing commissioning efforts. However, inevitable model uncertainties and measurement noise can result in comfort violations, even with dedicated MPC setups. This paper introduces a Disturbance-Adaptive DPC (DAD-DPC) framework that ensures asymptotic satisfaction of predefined violation bounds without knowing the uncertainty and noise distributions. The framework employs a data-driven pipeline based on Willems' Fundamental Lemma and conformal prediction for application in building climate control. The proposed DAD-DPC framework was validated through four building cases using the high-fidelity BOPTEST simulation platform and an occupied campus building, Polydome. DAD-DPC successfully regulated the average comfort violations to meet pre-defined bounds. Notably, the 5%-violation DAD-DPC setup achieved 30.1%/11.2%/27.1%/20.5% energy savings compared to default controllers across four cases. These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in balancing energy consumption and comfort violations, offering a practical solution for building climate control applications.

Title: Modern Base Station Architecture: Enabling Passive Beamforming with Beyond Diagonal RISs
Authors: Mahmoud Raeisi, Hui Chen, Henk Wymeersch, Ertugrul Basar
Abstract: Beamforming plays a crucial role in millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems to mitigate the severe attenuation inherent to this spectrum. However, the use of large active antenna arrays in conventional architectures often results in high implementation costs and excessive power consumption, limiting their practicality. As an alternative, deploying large arrays at transceivers using passive devices, such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), offers a more cost-effective and energy-efficient solution. In this paper, we investigate a promising base station (BS) architecture that integrates a beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) within the BS to enable passive beamforming. By utilizing Takagi's decomposition and leveraging the effective beamforming vector, the RIS profile can be designed to enable passive beamforming directed toward the target. Through the beamforming analysis, we reveal that BD-RIS provides robust beamforming performance across various system configurations, whereas the traditional diagonal RIS (D-RIS) exhibits instability with increasing RIS size and decreasing BS-RIS separation-two critical factors in optimizing RIS-assisted systems. Comprehensive computer simulation results across various aspects validate the superiority of the proposed BS-integrated BD-RIS over conventional D-RIS architectures, showcasing performance comparable to active analog beamforming antenna arrays.

Title: Theoretical Grid-Forming Extreme of Inverters
Authors: Qianxi Tang, Li Peng
Abstract: What are the theoretical and physical limits of a grid-forming inverter? This letter proposes that the extreme grid-forming ability of inverters is limited by their dc-side, ac-side, circuit topology dynamics, but not control. While many papers focus on how to improve grid-forming inverters stability, power sharing, inertia emulation, fault response, few, if any, formally define the fundamental theoretical limits or extremes of grid-forming behavior. It seems that the grid-forming can be improved endlessly. No physical system can support a grid indefinitely without limitations, especially under increasing levels of disturbance or uncertainty. Therefore, this boundary is explicitly shown by a mathematical expression in this letter. Consequently, the results show that relatively low dc-side voltage and high active power injection could damage the grid-forming ability. Poor consideration of dc-side, ac-side, and circuit topology dynamics in real practice will cause jeopardizing oscillation even by the theoretical best grid-forming control strategy.

Title: Teaching Audio-Aware Large Language Models What Does Not Hear: Mitigating Hallucinations through Synthesized Negative Samples
Authors: Chun-Yi Kuan, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: Recent advancements in audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) enable them to process and understand audio inputs. However, these models often hallucinate non-existent sound events, reducing their reliability in real-world applications. To address this, we propose LISTEN (Learning to Identify Sounds Through Extended Negative Samples), a contrastive-like training method that enhances ALLMs' ability to distinguish between present and absent sounds using synthesized data from the backbone LLM. Unlike prior approaches, our method requires no modification to LLM parameters and efficiently integrates audio representations via a lightweight adapter. Experiments show that LISTEN effectively mitigates hallucinations while maintaining impressive performance on existing audio question and reasoning benchmarks. At the same time, it is more efficient in both data and computation.

Title: Machine Learning-Based Analysis of ECG and PCG Signals for Rheumatic Heart Disease Detection: A Scoping Review (2015-2025)
Authors: Damilare Emmanuel Olatunji, Julius Dona Zannu, Carine Pierrette Mukamakuza, Godbright Nixon Uiso, Chol Buol, Mona Mamoun Mubarak Aman, John Bosco Thuo, Nchofon Tagha Ghogomu, Evelyne Umubyeyi
Abstract: AI-powered stethoscopes offer a promising alternative for screening rheumatic heart disease (RHD), particularly in regions with limited diagnostic infrastructure. Early detection is vital, yet echocardiography, the gold standard tool, remains largely inaccessible in low-resource settings due to cost and workforce constraints. This review systematically examines machine learning (ML) applications from 2015 to 2025 that analyze electrocardiogram (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) data to support accessible, scalable screening of all RHD variants in relation to the World Heart Federation's "25 by 25" goal to reduce RHD mortality. Using PRISMA-ScR guidelines, 37 peer-reviewed studies were selected from PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Embase. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) dominate recent efforts, achieving a median accuracy of 97.75%, F1-score of 0.95, and AUROC of 0.89. However, challenges remain: 73% of studies used single-center datasets, 81.1% relied on private data, only 10.8% were externally validated, and none assessed cost-effectiveness. Although 45.9% originated from endemic regions, few addressed demographic diversity or implementation feasibility. These gaps underscore the disconnect between model performance and clinical readiness. Bridging this divide requires standardized benchmark datasets, prospective trials in endemic areas, and broader validation. If these issues are addressed, AI-augmented auscultation could transform cardiovascular diagnostics in underserved populations, thereby aiding early detection. This review also offers practical recommendations for building accessible ML-based RHD screening tools, aiming to close the diagnostic gap in low-resource settings where conventional auscultation may miss up to 90% of cases and echocardiography remains out of reach.

Title: Prompt-Guided Latent Diffusion with Predictive Class Conditioning for 3D Prostate MRI Generation
Authors: Emerson P. Grabke, Masoom A. Haider, Babak Taati
Abstract: Objective: Latent diffusion models (LDM) could alleviate data scarcity challenges affecting machine learning development for medical imaging. However, medical LDM strategies typically rely on short-prompt text encoders, non-medical LDMs, or large data volumes. These strategies can limit performance and scientific accessibility. We propose a novel LDM conditioning approach to address these limitations. Methods: We propose Class-Conditioned Efficient Large Language model Adapter (CCELLA), a novel dual-head conditioning approach that simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net with free-text clinical reports and radiology classification. We also propose a data-efficient LDM framework centered around CCELLA and a proposed joint loss function. We first evaluate our method on 3D prostate MRI against state-of-the-art. We then augment a downstream classifier model training dataset with synthetic images from our method. Results: Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a size-limited 3D prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent foundation model with FID 0.071. When training a classifier for prostate cancer prediction, adding synthetic images generated by our method during training improves classifier accuracy from 69% to 74%. Training a classifier solely on our method's synthetic images achieved comparable performance to training on real images alone. Conclusion: We show that our method improved both synthetic image quality and downstream classifier performance using limited data and minimal human annotation. Significance: The proposed CCELLA-centric framework enables radiology report and class-conditioned LDM training for high-quality medical image synthesis given limited data volume and human data annotation, improving LDM performance and scientific accessibility.

Title: Symmetric Sliding-Mode Control of Grid-Forming Inverters With Precision Region Under AC and DC Sides Varying
Authors: Qianxi Tang, Li Peng, Xuefeng Wang, Xinchen Yao
Abstract: Voltage regulation under conventional grid-forming controllers is tightly coupled to power sharing and dc-link dynamics. Consequently, its tracking accuracy deteriorates during grid faults, sudden power sharing changes, or dc-bus voltage varying. To address this issue, a symmetric sliding-mode control (SSMC) method is developed and its voltage precision region is derived. It illustrates how much ac-side power dynamics and dc-link voltage varying can be decoupled from the voltage regulation task, which helps predict when an abnormal entangling appears. While conventional sliding-mode controls address voltage-tracking error through complex sliding surface designs, repetitive correction techniques or special reaching laws, this work identifies that the error at power-line frequency primarily stem from the asymmetry property of inverters with the delay effect and the computational inaccuracy. Guided by this insight, an asymmetry compensation structure is proposed, which avoids added design complexity and directly mitigates voltage tracking error. Furthermore, the control design is supported by a physical and quantitative explanation, aiding in parameter tuning. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves faster tracking responses while maintaining robust and more accurate tracking under both dc-link voltage and ac-side current variations. Conventional grid-forming and classical sliding-mode controllers, which handle these variations separately, cannot match this combined speed and robustness. Furthermore, the voltage precision region is explicitly verified.

Title: ICME 2025 Grand Challenge on Video Super-Resolution for Video Conferencing
Authors: Babak Naderi, Ross Cutler, Juhee Cho, Nabakumar Khongbantabam, Dejan Ivkovic
Abstract: Super-Resolution (SR) is a critical task in computer vision, focusing on reconstructing high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) inputs. The field has seen significant progress through various challenges, particularly in single-image SR. Video Super-Resolution (VSR) extends this to the temporal domain, aiming to enhance video quality using methods like local, uni-, bi-directional propagation, or traditional upscaling followed by restoration. This challenge addresses VSR for conferencing, where LR videos are encoded with H.265 at fixed QPs. The goal is to upscale videos by a specific factor, providing HR outputs with enhanced perceptual quality under a low-delay scenario using causal models. The challenge included three tracks: general-purpose videos, talking head videos, and screen content videos, with separate datasets provided by the organizers for training, validation, and testing. We open-sourced a new screen content dataset for the SR task in this challenge. Submissions were evaluated through subjective tests using a crowdsourced implementation of the ITU-T Rec P.910.

Title: Volumetric segmentation of muscle compartments using in vivo imaging and architectural validation in human finger flexors
Authors: Yang Li
Abstract: Segmenting muscle compartments and measuring their architecture can facilitate movement function assessment, accurate musculoskeletal modeling, and synergy-based electromyogram simulation. Here, we presented a novel method for volumetric segmentation of muscle compartments using in vivo imaging, focusing on the independent compartments for finger control of flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS). Besides, we measured the architectural properties of FDS compartments and validated the segmentation. Specifically, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from 10 healthy subjects were used for segmentation and measurement, while electromyography was utilized for validation. A two-step piecewise segmentation was proposed, first annotating compartment regions in the cross-sectional ultrasound image based on compartment movement, and then performing minimum energy matching to register the ultrasound data to the three-dimensional MRI coordinate system. Additionally, the architectural properties were measured in the compartment masks from the segmentation using MRI tractography. Anatomical correctness was verified by comparing known anatomy with reconstructed fiber tracts and measured properties, while segmentation accuracy was quantified as the percentage of finger electromyogram centers falling within their corresponding compartments. Results demonstrated agreement for the fiber orientation between the tractography and cadaveric photographs. Significant differences in architectural properties (P < 0.001) were observed between compartments. The properties of FDS and its compartments were within the physiological ranges (P < 0.01). 95% (38/40) of the electromyogram centers were located within respective compartments, with 2 errors occurring in the index and little fingers. The validated segmentation method and derived architectural properties may advance biomedical applications.

Title: Sensing-Aware Transmit Waveform/Receive Filter Design for OFDM-MBS Systems
Authors: Xinghe Li, Kainan Cheng, Hongzhi Guo, Huiyong Li, Ziyang Cheng
Abstract: In this letter, we study the problem of cooperative sensing design for an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) multiple base stations (MBS) system. We consider a practical scenario where the base stations (BSs) exploit certain subcarriers to realize a sensing function. Since the high sidelobe level (SLL) of OFDM waveforms degrades radar detection for weak targets, and the cross-correlation generated by other BSs further exacerbates detection performance, we devise a joint design scheme for OFDM sequence and receive filter by minimizing the integrated sidelobe level (ISL) while satisfying mainlobe level, peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and spectrum allocation constraints. To address this non-convex problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating the superiority of SSL reduction in the MBS system over the matched filtering method.

Title: Dehazing Light Microscopy Images with Guided Conditional Flow Matching: finding a sweet spot between fidelity and realism
Authors: Anirban Ray, Ashesh, Florian Jug
Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is a major driver of scientific progress in the life sciences. Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering out-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as widefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data. Computational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to cheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off tells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high PSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID. Existing methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or produce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In this work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light microscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to find a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the realism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the conditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a hazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on 5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion and perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 7 baselines, achieving a consistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with calibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated predictions. Note that our method does not need an explicit degradation operator to exist, making it easily applicable on real microscopy data. All data used for training and evaluation and our code will be publicly available under a permissive license.

Title: Hierarchical Decentralized Stochastic Control for Cyber-Physical Systems
Authors: Kesav Kaza, Ramachandran Anantharaman, Rahul Meshram
Abstract: This paper presents a two-timescale hierarchical decentralized architecture for control of Cyber-Physical Systems. The architecture consists of $N$ independent sub-processes, a global controller, and $N$ local controllers, each formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The global controller, operating at a slower timescale optimizes the infinite-horizon discounted cumulative reward under budget constraints. For the local controllers, operating at a faster timescale, we propose two different optimization frameworks, namely the COpt and FOpt. In the COpt framework, the local controller also optimizes an infinite-horizon MDP, while in the FOpt framework, the local controller optimizes a finite-horizon MDP. The FOpt framework mimics a federal structure, where the local controllers have more autonomy in their decision making. First, the existence of stationary deterministic optimal policies for both these frameworks is established. Then, various relationships between the two frameworks are studied, including a bound on the difference between the two optimal value functions. Additionally, sufficiency conditions are provided such that the two frameworks lead to the same optimal values.

Title: Exposing and Mitigating Calibration Biases and Demographic Unfairness in MLLM Few-Shot In-Context Learning for Medical Image Classification
Authors: Xing Shen, Justin Szeto, Mingyang Li, Hengguan Huang, Tal Arbel
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enormous potential to perform few-shot in-context learning in the context of medical image analysis. However, safe deployment of these models into real-world clinical practice requires an in-depth analysis of the accuracies of their predictions, and their associated calibration errors, particularly across different demographic subgroups. In this work, we present the first investigation into the calibration biases and demographic unfairness of MLLMs' predictions and confidence scores in few-shot in-context learning for medical image classification. We introduce CALIN, an inference-time calibration method designed to mitigate the associated biases. Specifically, CALIN estimates the amount of calibration needed, represented by calibration matrices, using a bi-level procedure: progressing from the population level to the subgroup level prior to inference. It then applies this estimation to calibrate the predicted confidence scores during inference. Experimental results on three medical imaging datasets: PAPILA for fundus image classification, HAM10000 for skin cancer classification, and MIMIC-CXR for chest X-ray classification demonstrate CALIN's effectiveness at ensuring fair confidence calibration in its prediction, while improving its overall prediction accuracies and exhibiting minimum fairness-utility trade-off.

Title: SurgTPGS: Semantic 3D Surgical Scene Understanding with Text Promptable Gaussian Splatting
Authors: Yiming Huang, Long Bai, Beilei Cui, Kun Yuan, Guankun Wang, Mobarak I. Hoque, Nicolas Padoy, Nassir Navab, Hongliang Ren
Abstract: In contemporary surgical research and practice, accurately comprehending 3D surgical scenes with text-promptable capabilities is particularly crucial for surgical planning and real-time intra-operative guidance, where precisely identifying and interacting with surgical tools and anatomical structures is paramount. However, existing works focus on surgical vision-language model (VLM), 3D reconstruction, and segmentation separately, lacking support for real-time text-promptable 3D queries. In this paper, we present SurgTPGS, a novel text-promptable Gaussian Splatting method to fill this gap. We introduce a 3D semantics feature learning strategy incorporating the Segment Anything model and state-of-the-art vision-language models. We extract the segmented language features for 3D surgical scene reconstruction, enabling a more in-depth understanding of the complex surgical environment. We also propose semantic-aware deformation tracking to capture the seamless deformation of semantic features, providing a more precise reconstruction for both texture and semantic features. Furthermore, we present semantic region-aware optimization, which utilizes regional-based semantic information to supervise the training, particularly promoting the reconstruction quality and semantic smoothness. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two real-world surgical datasets to demonstrate the superiority of SurgTPGS over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its potential to revolutionize surgical practices. SurgTPGS paves the way for developing next-generation intelligent surgical systems by enhancing surgical precision and safety. Our code is available at: this https URL.

Title: Contrastive Conditional Latent Diffusion for Audio-visual Segmentation
Authors: Yuxin Mao, Jing Zhang, Mochu Xiang, Yunqiu Lv, Dong Li, Yiran Zhong, Yuchao Dai
Abstract: We propose a contrastive conditional latent diffusion model for audio-visual segmentation (AVS) to thoroughly investigate the impact of audio, where the correlation between audio and the final segmentation map is modeled to guarantee the strong correlation between them. To achieve semantic-correlated representation learning, our framework incorporates a latent diffusion model. The diffusion model learns the conditional generation process of the ground-truth segmentation map, resulting in ground-truth aware inference during the denoising process at the test stage. As our model is conditional, it is vital to ensure that the conditional variable contributes to the model output. We thus extensively model the contribution of the audio signal by minimizing the density ratio between the conditional probability of the multimodal data, e.g. conditioned on the audio-visual data, and that of the unimodal data, e.g. conditioned on the audio data only. In this way, our latent diffusion model via density ratio optimization explicitly maximizes the contribution of audio for AVS, which can then be achieved with contrastive learning as a constraint, where the diffusion part serves as the main objective to achieve maximum likelihood estimation, and the density ratio optimization part imposes the constraint. By adopting this latent diffusion model via contrastive learning, we effectively enhance the contribution of audio for AVS. The effectiveness of our solution is validated through experimental results on the benchmark dataset. Code and results are online via our project page: this https URL.

Title: On the Cost of Consecutive Estimation Error: Significance-Aware Non-linear Aging
Authors: Jiping Luo, Nikolaos Pappas
Abstract: This paper considers the semantics-aware remote state estimation of an asymmetric Markov chain with prioritized states. Due to resource constraints, the sensor needs to trade between estimation quality and communication cost. The aim is to exploit the significance of information through the history of system realizations to determine the optimal timing of transmission, thereby reducing the amount of uninformative data transmitted in the network. To this end, we introduce a new metric, the significance-aware Age of Consecutive Error (AoCE), that captures two semantic attributes: the significance of estimation error and the cost of consecutive error. Different costs and non-linear age functions are assigned to different estimation errors to account for their relative importance to system performance. We identify the optimal transmission problem as a countably infinite state Markov decision process (MDP) with unbounded costs. We first give sufficient conditions on the age functions, source pattern, and channel reliability so that an optimal policy exists to have bounded average costs. We show that the optimal policy exhibits a switching structure. That is, the sensor triggers a transmission only when the system has been trapped in an error for a certain number of consecutive time slots. We also provide sufficient conditions under which the switching policy degenerates into a simple threshold policy, i.e., featuring identical thresholds for all estimation errors. Furthermore, we exploit the structural properties and develop a structured policy iteration (SPI) algorithm that considerably reduces computation overhead. Numerical results show that the optimal policy outperforms the classic rule-, distortion- and age-based policies. An important takeaway is that the more semantic attributes we utilize, the fewer transmissions are needed.

Title: Generative AI-based data augmentation for improved bioacoustic classification in noisy environments
Authors: Anthony Gibbons, Emma King, Ian Donohue, Andrew Parnell
Abstract: 1. Obtaining data to train robust artificial intelligence (AI)-based models for species classification can be challenging, particularly for rare species. Data augmentation can boost classification accuracy by increasing the diversity of training data and is cheaper to obtain than expert-labelled data. However, many classic image-based augmentation techniques are not suitable for audio spectrograms. 2. We investigate two generative AI models as data augmentation tools to synthesise spectrograms and supplement audio data: Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Networks (ACGAN) and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). The latter performed particularly well in terms of both realism of generated spectrograms and accuracy in a resulting classification task. 3. Alongside these new approaches, we present a new audio data set of 640 hours of bird calls from wind farm sites in Ireland, approximately 800 samples of which have been labelled by experts. Wind farm data are particularly challenging for classification models given the background wind and turbine noise. 4. Training an ensemble of classification models on real and synthetic data combined gave 92.6% accuracy (and 90.5% with just the real data) when compared with highly confident BirdNET predictions. 5. Our approach can be used to augment acoustic signals for more species and other land-use types, and has the potential to bring about a step-change in our capacity to develop reliable AI-based detection of rare species.

Title: ECG-Byte: A Tokenizer for End-to-End Generative Electrocardiogram Language Modeling
Authors: William Han, Chaojing Duan, Michael A. Rosenberg, Emerson Liu, Ding Zhao
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional versatility across domains, including applications to electrocardiograms (ECGs). A growing body of work focuses on generating text from multi-channeled ECG signals and corresponding textual prompts. Existing approaches often involve a two-stage process: pretraining an ECG-specific encoder with a self-supervised learning (SSL) objective, followed by finetuning an LLM for natural language generation (NLG) using encoder-derived features. However, these methods face two key limitations: inefficiency due to multi-stage training and challenges in interpreting encoder-generated features. To overcome these issues, we propose ECG-Byte, an adapted byte pair encoding (BPE) tokenizer pipeline for autoregressive language modeling of ECGs. ECG-Byte compresses and encodes ECG signals into tokens, enabling direct end-to-end LLM training by combining ECG and text tokens. This approach enhances interpretability, as ECG tokens can be directly mapped back to the original signals. Leveraging ECG-Byte, we achieve competitive NLG performance while training 3 times faster and using just 48\% of the data required by traditional two-stage methods.

Title: ETTA: Elucidating the Design Space of Text-to-Audio Models
Authors: Sang-gil Lee, Zhifeng Kong, Arushi Goel, Sungwon Kim, Rafael Valle, Bryan Catanzaro
Abstract: Recent years have seen significant progress in Text-To-Audio (TTA) synthesis, enabling users to enrich their creative workflows with synthetic audio generated from natural language prompts. Despite this progress, the effects of data, model architecture, training objective functions, and sampling strategies on target benchmarks are not well understood. With the purpose of providing a holistic understanding of the design space of TTA models, we set up a large-scale empirical experiment focused on diffusion and flow matching models. Our contributions include: 1) AF-Synthetic, a large dataset of high quality synthetic captions obtained from an audio understanding model; 2) a systematic comparison of different architectural, training, and inference design choices for TTA models; 3) an analysis of sampling methods and their Pareto curves with respect to generation quality and inference speed. We leverage the knowledge obtained from this extensive analysis to propose our best model dubbed Elucidated Text-To-Audio (ETTA). When evaluated on AudioCaps and MusicCaps, ETTA provides improvements over the baselines trained on publicly available data, while being competitive with models trained on proprietary data. Finally, we show ETTA's improved ability to generate creative audio following complex and imaginative captions -- a task that is more challenging than current benchmarks.

Title: Autonomous Robotic Bone Micro-Milling System with Automatic Calibration and 3D Surface Fitting
Authors: Enduo Zhao, Xiaofeng Lin, Yifan Wang, Kanako Harada
Abstract: Automating bone micro-milling using a robotic system presents challenges due to the uncertainties in both the external and internal features of bone tissue. For example, during mouse cranial window creation, a circular path with a radius of 2 to 4 mm needs to be milled on the mouse skull using a microdrill. The uneven surface and non-uniform thickness of the mouse skull make it difficult to fully automate this process, requiring the system to possess advanced perceptual and adaptive capabilities. In this study, we address this challenge by integrating a Microscopic Stereo Camera System (MSCS) into the robotic bone micro-milling system and proposing a novel pre-measurement pipeline for the target surface. Starting from uncalibrated cameras, the pipeline enables automatic calibration and 3D surface fitting through a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based keypoint detection. Combined with the existing feedback-based system, we develop the world's first autonomous robotic bone micro-milling system capable of rapidly, in real-time, and accurately perceiving and adapting to surface unevenness and non-uniform thickness, thereby enabling an end-to-end autonomous cranial window creation workflow without human assistance. Validation experiments on euthanized mice demonstrate that the improved system achieves a success rate of 85.7% and an average milling time of 2.1 minutes, showing not only significant performance improvements over the previous system but also exceptional accuracy, speed, and stability compared to human operators.

Title: Mirror Online Conformal Prediction with Intermittent Feedback
Authors: Bowen Wang, Matteo Zecchin, Osvaldo Simeone
Abstract: Online conformal prediction enables the runtime calibration of a pre-trained artificial intelligence model using feedback on its performance. Calibration is achieved through set predictions that are updated via online rules so as to ensure long-term coverage guarantees. While recent research has demonstrated the benefits of incorporating prior knowledge into the calibration process, this has come at the cost of replacing coverage guarantees with less tangible regret guarantees based on the quantile loss. This work introduces intermittent mirror online conformal prediction (IM-OCP), a novel runtime calibration framework that integrates prior knowledge, operates under potentially intermittent feedback, and features minimal memory complexity. IM-OCP guarantees long-term coverage and sub-linear regret, both of which hold deterministically for any given data sequence and in expectation with respect to the intermittent feedback.

Title: Analogical Learning for Cross-Scenario Generalization: Framework and Application to Intelligent Localization
Authors: Zirui Chen, Zhaoyang Zhang, Ziqing Xing, Ridong Li, Zhaohui Yang, Richeng Jin, Chongwen Huang, Yuzhi Yang, Mérouane Debbah
Abstract: Existing learning models often exhibit poor generalization when deployed across diverse scenarios. It is primarily due to that the underlying reference frame of the data varies with the deployment environment and settings. However, despite that data of each scenario has a distinct reference frame, its generation generally follows common underlying physical rules. Based on this understanding, this article proposes a deep learning framework named analogical learning (AL), which implicitly retrieves the reference frame information associated with a scenario and then to make accurate prediction by relative analogy with other scenarios. Specifically, we design a bipartite neural network called Mateformer. Its first part captures the relativity within multiple latent feature spaces between the input data and a small amount of embedded data from the studied scenario, while its second part uses this relativity to guide the nonlinear analogy. We apply AL to the typical multi-scenario learning problem of intelligent wireless localization in cellular networks. Extensive experiments validate AL's superiority across three key dimensions. First, it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in single-scenario benchmarks. Second, it demonstrates stable transferability between different scenarios, avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Finally, and most importantly, it robustly adapts to new, unseen scenarios--including dynamic weather and traffic conditions--without any tuning. All data and code are available at this https URL.

Title: ELGAR: Expressive Cello Performance Motion Generation for Audio Rendition
Authors: Zhiping Qiu, Yitong Jin, Yuan Wang, Yi Shi, Chongwu Wang, Chao Tan, Xiaobing Li, Feng Yu, Tao Yu, Qionghai Dai
Abstract: The art of instrument performance stands as a vivid manifestation of human creativity and emotion. Nonetheless, generating instrument performance motions is a highly challenging task, as it requires not only capturing intricate movements but also reconstructing the complex dynamics of the performer-instrument interaction. While existing works primarily focus on modeling partial body motions, we propose Expressive ceLlo performance motion Generation for Audio Rendition (ELGAR), a state-of-the-art diffusion-based framework for whole-body fine-grained instrument performance motion generation solely from audio. To emphasize the interactive nature of the instrument performance, we introduce Hand Interactive Contact Loss (HICL) and Bow Interactive Contact Loss (BICL), which effectively guarantee the authenticity of the interplay. Moreover, to better evaluate whether the generated motions align with the semantic context of the music audio, we design novel metrics specifically for string instrument performance motion generation, including finger-contact distance, bow-string distance, and bowing score. Extensive evaluations and ablation studies are conducted to validate the efficacy of the proposed methods. In addition, we put forward a motion generation dataset SPD-GEN, collated and normalized from the MoCap dataset SPD. As demonstrated, ELGAR has shown great potential in generating instrument performance motions with complicated and fast interactions, which will promote further development in areas such as animation, music education, interactive art creation, etc.

Abstract: The rapid advancement and expanding applications of Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs) demand a rigorous understanding of their trustworthiness. However, systematic research on evaluating these models, particularly concerning risks unique to the audio modality, remains largely unexplored. Existing evaluation frameworks primarily focus on the text modality or address only a restricted set of safety dimensions, failing to adequately account for the unique characteristics and application scenarios inherent to the audio modality. We introduce AudioTrust-the first multifaceted trustworthiness evaluation framework and benchmark specifically designed for ALLMs. AudioTrust facilitates assessments across six key dimensions: fairness, hallucination, safety, privacy, robustness, and authentication. To comprehensively evaluate these dimensions, AudioTrust is structured around 18 distinct experimental setups. Its core is a meticulously constructed dataset of over 4,420 audio/text samples, drawn from real-world scenarios (e.g., daily conversations, emergency calls, voice assistant interactions), specifically designed to probe the multifaceted trustworthiness of ALLMs. For assessment, the benchmark carefully designs 9 audio-specific evaluation metrics, and we employ a large-scale automated pipeline for objective and scalable scoring of model outputs. Experimental results reveal the trustworthiness boundaries and limitations of current state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source ALLMs when confronted with various high-risk audio scenarios, offering valuable insights for the secure and trustworthy deployment of future audio models.

Title: Bregman Centroid Guided Cross-Entropy Method
Authors: Yuliang Gu, Hongpeng Cao, Marco Caccamo, Naira Hovakimyan
Abstract: The Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) is a widely adopted trajectory optimizer in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), but its unimodal sampling strategy often leads to premature convergence in multimodal landscapes. In this work, we propose Bregman Centroid Guided CEM ($\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM), a lightweight enhancement to ensemble CEM that leverages $\textit{Bregman centroids}$ for principled information aggregation and diversity control. $\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ computes a performance-weighted Bregman centroid across CEM workers and updates the least contributing ones by sampling within a trust region around the centroid. Leveraging the duality between Bregman divergences and exponential family distributions, we show that $\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ integrates seamlessly into standard CEM pipelines with negligible overhead. Empirical results on synthetic benchmarks, a cluttered navigation task, and full MBRL pipelines demonstrate that $\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ enhances both convergence and solution quality, providing a simple yet effective upgrade for CEM.

Title: StreamFlow: Streaming Flow Matching with Block-wise Guided Attention Mask for Speech Token Decoding
Authors: Dake Guo, Jixun Yao, Linhan Ma, He Wang, Lei Xie
Abstract: Recent advancements in discrete token-based speech generation have highlighted the importance of token-to-waveform generation for audio quality, particularly in real-time interactions. Traditional frameworks integrating semantic tokens with flow matching (FM) struggle with streaming capabilities due to their reliance on a global receptive field. Additionally, directly implementing token-by-token streaming speech generation often results in degraded audio quality. To address these challenges, we propose StreamFlow, a novel neural architecture that facilitates streaming flow matching with diffusion transformers (DiT). To mitigate the long-sequence extrapolation issues arising from lengthy historical dependencies, we design a local block-wise receptive field strategy. Specifically, the sequence is first segmented into blocks, and we introduce block-wise attention masks that enable the current block to receive information from the previous or subsequent block. These attention masks are combined hierarchically across different DiT-blocks to regulate the receptive field of DiTs. Both subjective and objective experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to non-streaming methods while surpassing other streaming methods in terms of speech quality, all the while effectively managing inference time during long-sequence generation. Furthermore, our method achieves a notable first-packet latency of only 180 ms.\footnote{Speech samples: this https URL}
