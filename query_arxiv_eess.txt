Title: Transforming Computational Lithography with AC and AI -- Faster, More Accurate, and Energy-efficient
Authors: Saumyadip Mukhopadhyay, Kiho Yang, Kasyap Thottasserymana Vasudevan, Mounica Jyothi Divvela, Selim Dogru, Dilip Krishnamurthy, Fergo Treska, Werner Gillijns, Ryan Ryoung han Kim, Kumara Sastry, Vivek Singh
Abstract: From climate science to drug discovery, scientific computing demands have surged dramatically in recent years -- driven by larger datasets, more sophisticated models, and higher simulation fidelity. This growth rate far outpaces transistor scaling, leading to unsustainably rising costs, energy consumption, and emissions. Semiconductor manufacturing is no exception. Computational lithography -- involving transferring circuitry to silicon in diffraction-limited conditions -- is the largest workload in semiconductor manufacturing. It has also grown exceptionally complex as miniaturization has advanced in the angstrom-era, requiring more accurate modeling, intricate corrections, and broader solution-space exploration. Accelerated computing (AC) offers a solution by dramatically freeing up the compute and power envelope. AI augments these gains by serving as high-fidelity surrogates for compute-intensive steps. Together, they present a sustainable, next-generation computing platform for scientific workloads. This new paradigm needs a fundamental redesign of the software stack. For computational lithography, NVIDIA cuLitho reinvents the core primitives -- diffractive optics, computational geometry, multi-variant optimization, data processing -- to achieve a transformative 57X end-to-end acceleration. Beyond dramatically faster cycles, this expanded compute envelope enables more rigorous solutions, including curvilinear masks, high-numerical aperture extreme ultraviolet (high-NA EUV) lithography, and subatomic modeling. We reinvest a small fraction of the freed-up compute to include through-focus correction for better process resilience. Silicon experiments at IMEC show significant benefits compared to conventional methods -- 35% better process window and 19% better edge placement error. This is the first quantified chip-scale demonstration of the lithography benefits of AC and AI in silicon.

Title: Combining scEEG and PPG for reliable sleep staging using lightweight wearables
Authors: Jiawei Wang, Liang Xu, Shuntian Zheng, Yu Guan, Kaichen Wang, Ziqing Zhang, Chen Chen, Laurence T. Yang, Sai Gu
Abstract: Reliable sleep staging remains challenging for lightweight wearable devices such as single-channel electroencephalography (scEEG) or photoplethysmography (PPG). scEEG offers direct measurement of cortical activity and serves as the foundation for sleep staging, yet exhibits limited performance on light sleep stages. PPG provides a low-cost complement that captures autonomic signatures effective for detecting light sleep. However, prior PPG-based methods rely on full night recordings (8 - 10 hours) as input context, which is less practical to provide timely feedback for sleep intervention. In this work, we investigate scEEG-PPG fusion for 4-class sleep staging under short-window (30 s - 30 min) constraints. First, we evaluate the temporal context required for each modality, to better understand the relationship of sleep staging performance with respect to monitoring window. Second, we investigate three fusion strategies: score-level fusion, cross-attention fusion enabling feature-level interactions, and Mamba-enhanced fusion incorporating temporal context modeling. Third, we train and evaluate on the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) dataset and perform cross-dataset validation on the Cleveland Family Study (CFS) and the Apnea, Bariatric surgery, and CPAP (ABC) datasets. The Mamba-enhanced fusion achieves the best performance on MESA (Cohen's Kappa $\kappa$ = 0.798, Acc = 86.9%), with particularly notable improvement in light sleep classification (F1-score: 85.63% vs. 77.76%, recall: 82.85% vs. 69.95% for scEEG alone), and generalizes well to CFS and ABC datasets with different populations. These findings suggest that scEEG-PPG fusion is a promising approach for lightweight wearable based sleep monitoring, offering a pathway toward more accessible sleep health assessment.

Title: StrokeNeXt: A Siamese-encoder Approach for Brain Stroke Classification in Computed Tomography Imagery
Authors: Leo Thomas Ramos, Angel D. Sappa
Abstract: We present StrokeNeXt, a model for stroke classification in 2D Computed Tomography (CT) images. StrokeNeXt employs a dual-branch design with two ConvNeXt encoders, whose features are fused through a lightweight convolutional decoder based on stacked 1D operations, including a bottleneck projection and transformation layers, and a compact classification head. The model is evaluated on a curated dataset of 6,774 CT images, addressing both stroke detection and subtype classification between ischemic and hemorrhage cases. StrokeNeXt consistently outperforms convolutional and Transformer-based baselines, reaching accuracies and F1-scores of up to 0.988. Paired statistical tests confirm that the performance gains are statistically significant, while class-wise sensitivity and specificity demonstrate robust behavior across diagnostic categories. Calibration analysis shows reduced prediction error compared to competing methods, and confusion matrix results indicate low misclassification rates. In addition, the model exhibits low inference time and fast convergence.

Title: Large elements and advanced beamformers for increased field of view in 2-D ultrasound matrix arrays
Authors: Mick Gardner, Michael L. Oelze
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound promises various medical applications for abdominal, obstetrics, and cardiovascular imaging. However, ultrasound matrix arrays have extremely high element counts limiting their field of view (FOV). This work seeks to demonstrate an increased field-of-view using a reduced element count array design. The approach is to increase the element size and use advanced beamformers to maintain image quality. The delay and sum (DAS), Null Subtraction Imaging (NSI), directional coherence factor (DCF), and Minimum Variance (MV) beamformers were compared. K-wave simulations of the 3D point-spread functions (PSF) of NSI, DCF, and MV display reduced side lobes and narrowed main lobes compared to DAS. Experiments were conducted using a multiplexed 1024-element matrix array on a Verasonics 256 system. Elements were electronically coupled to imitate a larger pitch and element size. Then, a virtual large aperture was created by using a positioning system to collect data in sections with the matrix array. High-quality images were obtained using a coupling factor of two, doubling the FOV while maintaining the same element count in the virtual large aperture as the original matrix array. The NSI beamformer demonstrated the best resolution performance in simulations and on the large aperture, maintaining the same resolution as uncoupled DAS for coupling factors up to 4. Our results demonstrate how larger matrix arrays could be constructed with larger elements, with resolution maintained by advanced beamformers.

Title: Secure High-Resolution ISAC via Multi-Layer Intelligent Metasurfaces: A Layered Optimization Framework
Authors: Amirhossein Taherpour, Abbas Taherpour, Tamer Khattab
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a pivotal technology for next-generation wireless networks, enabling simultaneous data transmission and environmental sensing. However, existing ISAC systems face fundamental limitations in achieving high-resolution sensing while maintaining robust communication security and spectral efficiency. This paper introduces a transformative approach leveraging stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) to overcome these challenges. We propose a multi-functional SIM-assisted system that jointly optimizes communication secrecy and sensing accuracy through a novel layered optimization framework. Our solution employs a multi-objective optimization formulation that balances secrecy rate maximization with sensing error minimization under practical hardware constraints. The proposed layered block coordinate descent algorithm efficiently coordinates sensing configuration, secure beamforming, communication metasurface optimization, and resource allocation while ensuring robustness to channel uncertainties. Extensive simulations demonstrate significant performance gains over conventional approaches, achieving 32-61\% improvement in sensing accuracy and 15-35\% enhancement in secrecy rates while maintaining computational efficiency. This work establishes a new paradigm for secure and high-precision multi-functional wireless systems.

Title: Multiplierless DFT Approximation Based on the Prime Factor Algorithm
Authors: L. Portella, F. M. Bayer, R. J. Cintra
Abstract: Matrix approximation methods have successfully produced efficient, low-complexity approximate transforms for the discrete cosine transforms and the discrete Fourier transforms. For the DFT case, literature archives approximations operating at small power-of-two blocklenghts, such as \{8, 16, 32\}, or at large blocklengths, such as 1024, which are obtained by means of the Cooley-Tukey-based approximation relying on the small-blocklength approximate transforms. Cooley-Tukey-based approximations inherit the intermediate multiplications by twiddled factors which are usually not approximated; otherwise the effected error propagation would prevent the overall good performance of the approximation. In this context, the prime factor algorithm can furnish the necessary framework for deriving fully multiplierless DFT approximations. We introduced an approximation method based on small prime-sized DFT approximations which entirely eliminates intermediate multiplication steps and prevents internal error propagation. To demonstrate the proposed method, we design a fully multiplierless 1023-point DFT approximation based on 3-, 11- and 31-point DFT approximations. The performance evaluation according to popular metrics showed that the proposed approximations not only presented a significantly lower arithmetic complexity but also resulted in smaller approximation error measurements when compared to competing methods.

Title: Embedding Economic Input-Output Models in Systems of Systems: An MBSE and Hetero-functional Graph Theory Approach
Authors: Mohammad Mhadi Naderi, Megan S. Harris, John C. Little, Amro M. Farid
Abstract: Characterizing the interdependent nature of Anthropocene systems of systems is fundamental to making informed decisions to address challenges across complex ecological, environmental, and coupled human-natural systems. This paper presents the first application of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and Hetero-functional Graph Theory (HFGT) to economic systems, establishing a scalable and extensible methodology for integrating economic input-output (EIO) models within a unified system-of-systems modeling framework. Integrating EIO models into the MBSE-HFGT workflow demonstrates how the structural form and function of economic systems can be expressed through SysML's graphical ontology and subsequently translated into the computational structure of HFGT. Using a synthetic Rectangular Choice of Technology (RCOT) example as a pedagogical foundation, the study confirms that the dynamics captured by basic EIO models, as well as other complex economic models grounded in EIO theory, can be equivalently reproduced within the MBSE-HFGT framework. The integration with MBSE and HFGT thus preserves analytical precision while offering enhanced graphical clarity and system-level insight through a shared ontological structure. By integrating modeling languages and mathematical frameworks, the proposed methodology establishes a foundation for knowledge co-production and integrated decision-making to address the multifaceted sustainability challenges associated with Anthropocene systems of systems.

Title: State Feedback Control of State-Delayed LPV Systems using Dynamics IQCs
Authors: Fen Wu
Abstract: This paper develops a new control framework for linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems with time-varying state delays by integrating parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions with integral quadratic constraints (IQCs). A novel delay-dependent state-feedback controller structure is proposed, consisting of a linear state-feedback law augmented with an additional term that captures the delay-dependent dynamics of the plant. Closed-loop stability and $\mathcal{L}_2$-gain performance are analyzed using dynamic IQCs and parameter-dependent quadratic Lyapunov functions, leading to convex synthesis conditions that guarantee performance in terms of parameter-dependent linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Unlike traditional delay control approaches, the proposed IQC-based framework provides a flexible and systematic methodology for handling delay effects, enabling enhanced control capability, reduced conservatism, and improved closed-loop performance.

Title: What Do Neurons Listen To? A Neuron-level Dissection of a General-purpose Audio Model
Authors: Takao Kawamura, Daisuke Niizumi, Nobutaka Ono
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the internal representations of a general-purpose audio self-supervised learning (SSL) model from a neuron-level perspective. Despite their strong empirical performance as feature extractors, the internal mechanisms underlying the robust generalization of SSL audio models remain unclear. Drawing on the framework of mechanistic interpretability, we identify and examine class-specific neurons by analyzing conditional activation patterns across diverse tasks. Our analysis reveals that SSL models foster the emergence of class-specific neurons that provide extensive coverage across novel task classes. These neurons exhibit shared responses across different semantic categories and acoustic similarities, such as speech attributes and musical pitch. We also confirm that these neurons have a functional impact on classification performance. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic neuron-level analysis of a general-purpose audio SSL model, providing new insights into its internal representation.

Title: SCENE OTA-FD: Self-Centering Noncoherent Estimator for Over-the-Air Federated Distillation
Authors: Hao Chen, Zavareh Bozorgasl
Abstract: We propose SCENE (Self-Centering Noncoherent Estimator), a pilot-free and phase-invariant aggregation primitive for over-the-air federated distillation (OTA-FD). Each device maps its soft-label (class-probability) vector to nonnegative transmit energies under constant per-round power and constant-envelope signaling (PAPR near 1). At the server, a self-centering energy estimator removes the noise-energy offset and yields an unbiased estimate of the weighted soft-label average, with variance decaying on the order of 1/(SM) in the number of receive antennas M and repetition factor S. We also develop a pilot-free ratio-normalized variant that cancels unknown large-scale gains, provide a convergence bound consistent with coherent OTA-FD analyses, and present an overhead-based crossover comparison. SCENE targets short-coherence and hardware-constrained regimes, where avoiding per-round CSI is essential: it trades a modest noncoherent variance constant for zero uplink pilots, unbiased aggregation, and hardware-friendly transmission, and can outperform coherent designs when pilot overhead is non-negligible.

Title: Noncooperative Coordination for Decentralized Air Traffic Management
Authors: Jaehan Im
Abstract: Decentralized air traffic management requires coordination among self-interested stakeholders operating under shared safety and capacity constraints, where conventional centralized or implicitly cooperative models do not adequately capture this setting. We develop a unified perspective on noncooperative coordination, in which system-level outcomes emerge by designing incentives and assigning signals that reshape individual optimality rather than imposing cooperation or enforcement. We advance this framework along three directions: scalable equilibrium engineering via reduced-rank and uncertainty-aware correlated equilibria, decentralized mechanism design for equilibrium selection without enforcement, and structured noncooperative dynamics with convergence guarantees. Beyond these technical contributions, we discuss core design principles that govern incentive-compatible coordination in decentralized systems. Together, these results establish a foundation for scalable, robust coordination in safety-critical air traffic systems.

Title: Benchmarking Self-Supervised Models for Cardiac Ultrasound View Classification
Authors: Youssef Megahed, Salma I. Megahed, Robin Ducharme, Inok Lee, Adrian D. C. Chan, Mark C. Walker, Steven Hawken
Abstract: Reliable interpretation of cardiac ultrasound images is essential for accurate clinical diagnosis and assessment. Self-supervised learning has shown promise in medical imaging by leveraging large unlabelled datasets to learn meaningful representations. In this study, we evaluate and compare two self-supervised learning frameworks, USF-MAE, developed by our team, and MoCo v3, on the recently introduced CACTUS dataset (37,736 images) for automated simulated cardiac view (A4C, PL, PSAV, PSMV, Random, and SC) classification. Both models used 5-fold cross-validation, enabling robust assessment of generalization performance across multiple random splits. The CACTUS dataset provides expert-annotated cardiac ultrasound images with diverse views. We adopt an identical training protocol for both models to ensure a fair comparison. Both models are configured with a learning rate of 0.0001 and a weight decay of 0.01. For each fold, we record performance metrics including ROC-AUC, accuracy, F1-score, and recall. Our results indicate that USF-MAE consistently outperforms MoCo v3 across metrics. The average testing AUC for USF-MAE is 99.99% (+/-0.01% 95% CI), compared to 99.97% (+/-0.01%) for MoCo v3. USF-MAE achieves a mean testing accuracy of 99.33% (+/-0.18%), higher than the 98.99% (+/-0.28%) reported for MoCo v3. Similar trends are observed for the F1-score and recall, with improvements statistically significant across folds (paired t-test, p=0.0048 < 0.01). This proof-of-concept analysis suggests that USF-MAE learns more discriminative features for cardiac view classification than MoCo v3 when applied to this dataset. The enhanced performance across multiple metrics highlights the potential of USF-MAE for improving automated cardiac ultrasound classification.

Title: Fine-Tuning LLMs to Generate Economical and Reliable Actions for the Power Grid
Authors: Mohamad Chehade, Hao Zhu
Abstract: Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS) force rapid topology changes that can render standard operating points infeasible, requiring operators to quickly identify corrective transmission switching actions that reduce load shedding while maintaining acceptable voltage behavior. We present a verifiable, multi-stage adaptation pipeline that fine-tunes an instruction-tuned large language model (LLM) to generate \emph{open-only} corrective switching plans from compact PSPS scenario summaries under an explicit switching budget. First, supervised fine-tuning distills a DC-OPF MILP oracle into a constrained action grammar that enables reliable parsing and feasibility checks. Second, direct preference optimization refines the policy using AC-evaluated preference pairs ranked by a voltage-penalty metric, injecting voltage-awareness beyond DC imitation. Finally, best-of-$N$ selection provides an inference-time addition by choosing the best feasible candidate under the target metric. On IEEE 118-bus PSPS scenarios, fine-tuning substantially improves DC objective values versus zero-shot generation, reduces AC power-flow failure from 50\% to single digits, and improves voltage-penalty outcomes on the common-success set. Code and data-generation scripts are released to support reproducibility.

Title: Generalized bilinear Koopman realization from input-output data for multi-step prediction with metaheuristic optimization of lifting function and its application to real-world industrial system
Authors: Shuichi Yahagi, Ansei Yonezawa, Heisei Yonezawa, Hiroki Seto, Itsuro Kajiwara
Abstract: This paper introduces an input-output bilinear Koopman realization with an optimization algorithm of lifting functions. For nonlinear systems with inputs, Koopman-based modeling is effective because the Koopman operator enables a high-dimensional linear representation of nonlinear dynamics. However, traditional approaches face significant challenges in industrial applications. Measuring all system states is often impractical due to constraints on sensor installation. Moreover, the predictive performance of a Koopman model strongly depends on the choice of lifting functions, and their design typically requires substantial manual effort. In addition, although a linear time-invariant (LTI) Koopman model is the most commonly used model structure in the Koopman framework, such model exhibit limited predictive accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose an input-output bilinear Koopman modeling in which the design parameters of radial basis function (RBF)-based lifting functions are optimized using a global metaheuristic algorithm to improve long-term prediction performance. Consideration of the long-term prediction performance enhances the reliability of the resulting model. The proposed methodology is validated in simulations and experimental tests, with the airpath control system of a diesel engine as the plant to be modeled. This plant represents a challenging industrial application because it exhibits strong nonlinearities and coupled multi-input multi-output (MIMO) dynamics. These results demonstrate that the proposed input-output bilinear Koopman model significantly outperforms traditional linear Koopman models in predictive accuracy.

Title: Bottleneck Transformer-Based Approach for Improved Automatic STOI Score Prediction
Authors: Amartyaveer, Murali Kadambi, Chandra Mohan Sharma, Anupam Mondal, Prasanta Kumar Ghosh
Abstract: In this study, we have presented a novel approach to predict the Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI) metric using a bottleneck transformer architecture. Traditional methods for calculating STOI typically requires clean reference speech, which limits their applicability in the real world. To address this, numerous deep learning-based nonintrusive speech assessment models have garnered significant interest. Many studies have achieved commendable performance, but there is room for further improvement. We propose the use of bottleneck transformer, incorporating convolution blocks for learning frame-level features and a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) layer to aggregate the information. These components enable the transformer to focus on the key aspects of the input data. Our model has shown higher correlation and lower mean squared error for both seen and unseen scenarios compared to the state-of-the-art model using self-supervised learning (SSL) and spectral features as inputs.

Title: Enroll-on-Wakeup: A First Comparative Study of Target Speech Extraction for Seamless Interaction in Real Noisy Human-Machine Dialogue Scenarios
Authors: Yiming Yang, Guangyong Wang, Haixin Guan, Yanhua Long
Abstract: Target speech extraction (TSE) typically relies on pre-recorded high-quality enrollment speech, which disrupts user experience and limits feasibility in spontaneous interaction. In this paper, we propose Enroll-on-Wakeup (EoW), a novel framework where the wake-word segment, captured naturally during human-machine interaction, is automatically utilized as the enrollment reference. This eliminates the need for pre-collected speech to enable a seamless experience. We perform the first systematic study of EoW-TSE, evaluating advanced discriminative and generative models under real diverse acoustic conditions. Given the short and noisy nature of wake-word segments, we investigate enrollment augmentation using LLM-based TTS. Results show that while current TSE models face performance degradation in EoW-TSE, TTS-based assistance significantly enhances the listening experience, though gaps remain in speech recognition accuracy.

Authors: Ferdinand Geuss, Orcun Karaca, Mario Schweizer, Ognjen Stanojev
Abstract: We derive a small-signal transfer function for a system comprising a virtual synchronous generator (VSG), a synchronous generator (SG), and a load, capturing voltage and frequency dynamics. Using this model, we analyze the sensitivity of SG dynamics to VSG parameters, highlighting trade-offs in choosing virtual inertia and governor lag, the limited effect of damper-winding emulation, and several others.

Title: Adaptive Selection of Codebook Using Assistance Information and Artificial Intelligence for 6G Systems
Authors: Denis Esiunin, Alexei Davydov
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of adaptive codebook (CB) selection for downlink (DL) precoder quantization in channel state information (CSI) reporting. The accuracy of precoder quantization depends on propagation conditions, requiring independent parameter adaptation for each user equipment (UE). To enable optimal CB selection, this paper proposes UE-assisted CB selection at the base station (BS) using reported by the UE statistical channel properties across time, frequency, and spatial domains. The reported assistance information serves as input to a neural network (NN), which predicts the quantization accuracy of various CB types for each served user. The predicted accuracy is then used to select the optimal CB while considering the associated CSI reporting overhead and precoding performance. System-level simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces total CSI overhead while maintaining the target system throughput performance.

Title: Waveform Design for ISAC System: A Consensus ADMM Approach
Authors: Ngoc-Son Duong, Huyen-Trang Ta, Quang-Tang Ngo, Thi-Hue Duong, Van-Lap Nguyen, Cong-Minh Nguyen, Minh-Tran Nguyen, Thai-Mai Dinh
Abstract: We study joint transmit-waveform and receive-filter design for a multi-user downlink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system under practical constant-modulus and similarity constraints. We cast the design as a unified multi-objective program that balances communication sum rate and sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). To address this, we introduce an efficient algorithm that use consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework to alternately update the transmit waveform and radar filter. The proposed method effectively handles the non-convex fractional sensing's SINR formulation and ensures fast convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves better trade-offs between communication sum rate and sensing's SINR compared to existing benchmark schemes.

Title: Tracking Time-Varying Multipath Channels forActive Sonar Applications
Authors: Ashwani Koul, Gustaf Hendeby, Isaac Skog
Abstract: Reliable detection and tracking in active sonar require accurate and efficient learning of the acoustic multipath background environment. Conventionally, background learning is performed after transforming measurements into the range-Doppler domain, a step that is computationally expensive and can obscure phase-coherent structure useful for monitoring and tracking. This paper proposes a framework for learning and tracking the multipath background directly in the raw measurement domain. Starting from a wideband Doppler linearization of the impulse response of a time-varying multipath channel, a state-space model with a heteroscedastic measurement equation is derived. This model enables channel tracking using an extended Kalman filter (EKF), and unknown model parameters are learned from the marginalized likelihood. The statistical adequacy of the proposed models is assessed via a p-value significance test. Finally, this paper integrates the learned channel model into a sequential likelihood-ratio test for target detection. BELLHOP-based simulations show that the proposed model better captures channel dynamics induced by sea-surface fluctuations and transmitter and receiver drift, yielding more reliable detection in time-varying shallow-water environments

Title: Time-Certified and Efficient NMPC via Koopman Operator
Authors: Liang Wu, Yunhong Che, Bo Yang, Kangyu Lin, Ján Drgoňa
Abstract: Certifying and accelerating execution times of nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) implementations are two core requirements. Execution-time certificate guarantees that the NMPC controller returns a solution before the next sampling time, and achieving faster worst-case and average execution times further enables its use in a wider set of applications. However, NMPC produces a nonlinear program (NLP) for which it is challenging to derive its execution time certificates. Our previous works, \citep{wu2025direct,wu2025time} provide data-independent execution time certificates (certified number of iterations) for box-constrained quadratic programs (BoxQP). To apply the time-certified BoxQP algorithm \citep{wu2025time} for state-input constrained NMPC, this paper i) learns a linear model via Koopman operator; ii) proposes a dynamic-relaxation construction approach yields a structured BoxQP rather than a general QP; iii) exploits the structure of BoxQP, where the dimension of the linear system solved in each iteration is reduced from $5N(n_u+n_x)$ to $Nn_u$ (where $n_u, n_x, N$ denote the number of inputs, states, and length of prediction horizon), yielding substantial speedups (when $n_x \gg n_u$, as in PDE control).

Title: Physics-Informed Anomaly Detection of Terrain Material Change in Radar Imagery
Authors: Abdel Hakiem Mohamed Abbas Mohamed Ahmed, Beth Jelfs, Airlie Chapman, Eric Schoof, Christopher Gilliam
Abstract: In this paper we consider physics-informed detection of terrain material change in radar imagery (e.g., shifts in permittivity, roughness or moisture). We propose a lightweight electromagnetic (EM) forward model to simulate bi-temporal single-look complex (SLC) images from labelled material maps. On these data, we derive physics-aware feature stacks that include interferometric coherence, and evaluate unsupervised detectors: Reed-Xiaoli (RX)/Local-RX with robust scatter (Tyler's M-estimator), Coherent Change Detection (CCD), and a compact convolutional auto-encoder. Monte Carlo experiments sweep dielectric/roughness/moisture changes, number of looks and clutter regimes (gamma vs K-family) at fixed probability of false alarm. Results on synthetic but physically grounded scenes show that coherence and robust covariance markedly improve anomaly detection of material changes; a simple score-level fusion achieves the best F1 in heavy-tailed clutter.

Title: Passive Imaging with Ambient Noise Under Wave Speed Mismatch: Mathematical Analysis and Wave Speed Estimation
Authors: Zetao Fei, Josselin Garnier
Abstract: It is known that waves generated by ambient noise sources and recorded by passive receivers can be used to image the reflectivities of an unknown medium. However, reconstructing the reflectivity of the medium from partial boundary measurements remains a challenging problem, particularly when the background wave speed is unknown. In this paper, we investigate passive correlation-based imaging in the daylight configuration, where uncontrolled noise sources illuminate the medium and only ambient fields are recorded by a sensor array. We first analyze daylight migration for a point reflector embedded in a homogeneous background. By introducing a searching wave speed into the migration functional, we derive an explicit characterization of the deterministic shift and defocusing effects induced by wave-speed mismatch. We show that the maximum of the envelope of the resulting functional provides a reliable estimator of the true wave speed. We then extend the analysis to a random medium with correlation length smaller than the wavelength. Leveraging the shift formula obtained in the homogeneous case, we introduce a virtual guide star that remains fixed under migration with different searching speeds. This property enables an effective wave-speed estimation strategy based on spatial averaging around the virtual guide star. For both homogeneous and random media, we establish resolution analyses for the proposed wave-speed estimators. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical result.

Title: Latency-aware Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning for Semantic Communications
Authors: Peizheng Li, Xinyi Lin, Adnan Aijaz
Abstract: Semantic communication promises task-aligned transmission but must reconcile semantic fidelity with stringent latency guarantees in immersive and safety-critical services. This paper introduces a time-constrained human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning (TC-HITL-RL) framework that embeds human feedback, semantic utility, and latency control within a semantic-aware Open radio access network (RAN) architecture. We formulate semantic adaptation driven by human feedback as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) whose state captures semantic quality, human preferences, queue slack, and channel dynamics, and solve it via a primal--dual proximal policy optimization algorithm with action shielding and latency-aware reward shaping. The resulting policy preserves PPO-level semantic rewards while tightening the variability of both air-interface and near-real-time RAN intelligent controller processing budgets. Simulations over point-to-multipoint links with heterogeneous deadlines show that TC-HITL-RL consistently meets per-user timing constraints, outperforms baseline schedulers in reward, and stabilizes resource consumption, providing a practical blueprint for latency-aware semantic adaptation.

Title: NYUSIM: A Roadmap to AI-Enabled Statistical Channel Modeling and Simulation
Authors: Isha Jariwala, Xinquan Wang, Bridget Meier, Guanyue Qian, Dipankar Shakya, Mingjun Ying, Homa Nikbakht, Daniel Abraham, Theodore S. Rappaport
Abstract: Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into wireless channel modeling requires large, accurate, and physically consistent datasets derived from real measurements. Such datasets are essential for training and validating models that learn spatio-temporal channel behavior across frequencies and environments. NYUSIM, introduced by NYU WIRELESS in 2016, generates realistic spatio-temporal channel data using extensive outdoor and indoor measurements between 28 and 142 GHz. To improve scalability and support 6G research, we migrated the complete NYUSIM framework from MATLAB to Python, and are incorporating new statistical model generation capabilities from extensive field measurements in the new 6G upper mid-band spectrum at 6.75 GHz (FR1(C)) and 16.95 GHz (FR3) [1]. The NYUSIM Python also incorporates a 3D antenna data format, referred to as Ant3D, which is a standardized, full-sphere format for defining canonical, commercial, or measured antenna patterns for any statistical or site-specific ray tracing modeling tool. Migration from MATLAB to Python was rigorously validated through Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) tests, moment analysis, and end-to-end testing with unified randomness control, confirming statistical consistency and reproduction of spatio-temporal channel statistics, including spatial consistency with the open-source MATLAB NYUSIM v4.0 implementation. The NYUSIM Python version is designed to integrate with modern AI workflows and enable large-scale parallel data generation, establishing a robust, verified, and extensible foundation for future AI-enabled channel modeling.

Title: Rate-Distortion Optimization for Ensembles of Non-Reference Metrics
Authors: Xin Xiong, Samuel Fernández-Menduiña, Eduardo Pavez, Antonio Ortega, Neil Birkbeck, Balu Adsumilli
Abstract: Non-reference metrics (NRMs) can assess the visual quality of images and videos without a reference, making them well-suited for the evaluation of user-generated content. Nonetheless, rate-distortion optimization (RDO) in video coding is still mainly driven by full-reference metrics, such as the sum of squared errors, which treat the input as an ideal target. A way to incorporate NRMs into RDO is through linearization (LNRM), where the gradient of the NRM with respect to the input guides bit allocation. While this strategy improves the quality predicted by some metrics, we show that it can yield limited gains or degradations when evaluated with other NRMs. We argue that NRMs are highly non-linear predictors with locally unstable gradients that can compromise the quality of the linearization; furthermore, optimizing a single metric may exploit model-specific biases that do not generalize across quality estimators. Motivated by this observation, we extend the LNRM framework to optimize ensembles of NRMs and, to further improve robustness, we introduce a smoothing-based formulation that stabilizes NRM gradients prior to linearization. Our framework is well-suited to hybrid codecs, and we advocate for its use with overfitted codecs, where it avoids iterative evaluations and backpropagation of neural network-based NRMs, reducing encoder complexity relative to direct NRM optimization. We validate the proposed approach on AVC and Cool-chic, using the YouTube UGC dataset. Experiments demonstrate consistent bitrate savings across multiple NRMs with no decoder complexity overhead and, for Cool-chic, a substantial reduction in encoding runtime compared to direct NRM optimization.

Title: Measurement-Based Validation of Geometry-Driven RIS Beam Steering in Industrial Environments
Authors: Adam Umra, Simon Tewes, Niklas Beckmann, Niels König, Aydin Sezgin, Robert Schmitt
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer programmable control of radio propagation for future wireless systems. For configuration, geometry-driven analytical approaches are appealing for their simplicity and real-time operation, but their performance in challenging environments such as industrial halls with dense multipath and metallic scattering is not well established. To this end, we present a measurement-based evaluation of geometry-driven RIS beam steering in a large industrial hall using a 5 GHz RIS prototype. A novel RIS configuration is proposed in which four patch antennas are mounted in close proximity in front of the RIS to steer the incident field and enable controlled reflection. For this setup, analytically computed, quantized configurations are implemented. Two-dimensional received power maps from two measurement areas reveal consistent, spatially selective focusing. Configurations optimized near the receiver produce clear power maxima, while steering to offset locations triggers a rapid 20-30 dB reduction. With increasing RIS-receiver distance, elevation selectivity broadens due to finite-aperture and geometric constraints, while azimuth steering remains robust. These results confirm the practical viability of geometry-driven RIS beam steering in industrial environments and support its use for spatial field control and localization under non-ideal propagation.

Title: Venting and Outgassing Simulations of Pressurized Lunar Modules: Contamination of the Lunar Environment
Authors: Stefano Boccelli, William M. Farrell, Prabal Saxena, Orenthal J. Tucker
Abstract: One objective of Artemis science is to determine the impact human activities have on the lunar environment, which might compromise science objectives and measurements. We perform a preliminary analysis of the contamination associated with airlock venting and outgassing from a prototype lunar-module geometry intended to host astronauts on the lunar surface. The air flow generated by the depressurization of the airlock, expanding in the lunar exosphere, is studied using the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method for two different venting configurations and the particle flux on the surface is computed as a function of the distance from the the module. Outgassing from the main body of the module -- assumed to be covered with a Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI) blanketing -- and from the solar panels is then analyzed using a view-factor method, employing outgassing rates from the this http URL results give preliminary indications of the distance at which contamination levels fall below the values characteristic of native species in the lunar atmosphere. Scientific measurements targeting 40Ar should be carried farther than 30--100 meters from the module, while the detection of lower-abundance species such as polar-crater water might require to travel up to and beyond 3 km from the module.

Title: Tomography by Design: An Algebraic Approach to Low-Rank Quantum States
Authors: Shakir Showkat Sofi, Charlotte Vermeylen, Lieven De Lathauwer
Abstract: We present an algebraic algorithm for quantum state tomography that leverages measurements of certain observables to estimate structured entries of the underlying density matrix. Under low-rank assumptions, the remaining entries can be obtained solely using standard numerical linear algebra operations. The proposed algebraic matrix completion framework applies to a broad class of generic, low-rank mixed quantum states and, compared with state-of-the-art methods, is computationally efficient while providing deterministic recovery guarantees.

Title: Intellicise Wireless Networks Meet Agentic AI: A Security and Privacy Perspective
Authors: Rui Meng, Zhidi Zhang, Song Gao, Yaheng Wang, Xiaodong Xu, Yijing Lin, Yiming Liu, Chenyuan Feng, Lexi Xu, Yi Ma, Ping Zhang, Rahim Tafazolli
Abstract: Intellicise (Intelligent and Concise) wireless network is the main direction of the evolution of future mobile communication systems, a perspective now widely acknowledged across academia and industry. As a key technology within it, Agentic AI has garnered growing attention due to its advanced cognitive capabilities, enabled through continuous perception-memory-reasoning-action cycles. This paper first analyses the unique advantages that Agentic AI introduces to intellicise wireless networks. We then propose a structured taxonomy for Agentic AI-enhanced secure intellicise wireless networks. Building on this framework, we identify emerging security and privacy challenges introduced by Agentic AI and summarize targeted strategies to address these vulnerabilities. A case study further demonstrates Agentic AI's efficacy in defending against intelligent eavesdropping attacks. Finally, we outline key open research directions to guide future exploration in this field.

Title: Corrected-Inverse-Gaussian First-Hitting-Time Modeling for Molecular Communication Under Time-Varying Drift
Authors: Yen-Chi Lee
Abstract: This paper develops a tractable analytical channel model for first-hitting-time molecular communication systems under time-varying drift. While existing studies of nonstationary transport rely primarily on numerical solutions of advection--diffusion equations or parametric impulse-response fitting, they do not provide a closed-form description of trajectory-level arrival dynamics at absorbing boundaries. By adopting a change-of-measure formulation, we reveal a structural decomposition of the first-hitting-time density into a cumulative-drift displacement term and a stochastic boundary-flux modulation factor. This leads to an explicit analytical expression for the Corrected-Inverse-Gaussian (C-IG) density, extending the classical IG model to strongly nonstationary drift conditions while preserving constant-complexity evaluation. High-precision Monte Carlo simulations under both smooth pulsatile and abrupt switching drift profiles confirm that the proposed model accurately captures complex transport phenomena, including phase modulation, multi-pulse dispersion, and transient backflow. The resulting framework provides a physics-informed, computationally efficient channel model suitable for system-level analysis and receiver design in dynamic biological and molecular communication environments.

Title: A Comparison of Bayesian Prediction Techniques for Mobile Robot Trajectory Tracking
Authors: Jose Luis Peralta-Cabezas, Miguel Torres-Torriti, Marcelo Guarini-Hermann
Abstract: This paper presents a performance comparison of different estimation and prediction techniques applied to the problem of tracking multiple robots. The main performance criteria are the magnitude of the estimation or prediction error, the computational effort and the robustness of each method to non-Gaussian noise. Among the different techniques compared are the well known Kalman filters and their different variants (e.g. extended and unscented), and the more recent techniques relying on Sequential Monte Carlo Sampling methods, such as particle filters and Gaussian Mixture Sigma Point Particle Filter.

Title: GMAIL: Generative Modality Alignment for generated Image Learning
Authors: Shentong Mo, Sukmin Yun
Abstract: Generative models have made it possible to synthesize highly realistic images, potentially providing an abundant data source for training machine learning models. Despite the advantages of these synthesizable data sources, the indiscriminate use of generated images as real images for training can even cause mode collapse due to modality discrepancies between real and synthetic domains. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for discriminative use of generated images, coined GMAIL, that explicitly treats generated images as a separate modality from real images. Instead of indiscriminately replacing real images with generated ones in the pixel space, our approach bridges the two distinct modalities in the same latent space through a multi-modal learning approach. To be specific, we first fine-tune a model exclusively on generated images using a cross-modality alignment loss and then employ this aligned model to further train various vision-language models with generated images. By aligning the two modalities, our approach effectively leverages the benefits of recent advances in generative models, thereby boosting the effectiveness of generated image learning across a range of vision-language tasks. Our framework can be easily incorporated with various vision-language models, and we demonstrate its efficacy throughout extensive experiments. For example, our framework significantly improves performance on image captioning, zero-shot image retrieval, zero-shot image classification, and long caption retrieval tasks. It also shows positive generated data scaling trends and notable enhancements in the captioning performance of the large multimodal model, LLaVA.

Title: A Geometric Approach to Feedback Stabilization of Nonlinear Systems with Drift
Authors: Hannah Michalska, Miguel Torres-Torriti
Abstract: The paper presents an approach to the construction of stabilizing feedback for strongly nonlinear systems. The class of systems of interest includes systems with drift which are affine in control and which cannot be stabilized by continuous state feedback. The approach is independent of the selection of a Lyapunov type function, but requires the solution of a nonlinear programming 'satisficing problem' stated in terms of the logarithmic coordinates of flows. As opposed to other approaches, point-to-point steering is not required to achieve asymptotic stability. Instead, the flow of the controlled system is required to intersect periodically a certain reachable set in the space of the logarithmic coordinates.

Title: A Universal Neural Receiver that Learns at the Speed of Wireless
Authors: Lingjia Liu, Lizhong Zheng, Yang Yi, Robert Calderbank
Abstract: Today we design wireless networks using mathematical models that govern communication in different propagation environments. We rely on measurement campaigns to deliver parametrized propagation models, and on the 3GPP standards process to optimize model-based performance, but as wireless networks become more complex this model-based approach is losing ground. Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) are counting on Artificial Intelligence (AI) to transform wireless by increasing spectral efficiency, reducing signaling overhead, and enabling continuous network innovation through software upgrades. They may also be interested in new use cases like integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). All we need is an AI-native physical layer, so why not simply tailor the offline AI algorithms that have revolutionized image and natural language processing to the wireless domain? We argue that these algorithms rely on off-line training that is precluded by the sub-millisecond speeds at which the wireless interference environment changes. We present an alternative architecture, a universal neural receiver based on convolution, which governs transmit and receive signal processing of any signal in any part of the wireless spectrum. Our neural receiver is designed to invert convolution, and we separate the question of which convolution to invert from the actual deconvolution. The neural network that performs deconvolution is very simple, and we configure this network by setting weights based on domain knowledge. By telling our neural network what we know, we avoid extensive offline training. By developing a universal receiver, we hope to simplify discussions about the proper choice of waveform for different use cases in the international standards. Since the receiver architecture is largely independent of technologies introduced at the base station, we hope to increase the rate of innovation in wireless.

Title: ZeroSyl: Simple Zero-Resource Syllable Tokenization for Spoken Language Modeling
Authors: Nicol Visser, Simon Malan, Danel Slabbert, Herman Kamper
Abstract: Pure speech language models aim to learn language directly from raw audio without textual resources. A key challenge is that discrete tokens from self-supervised speech encoders result in excessively long sequences, motivating recent work on syllable-like units. However, methods like Sylber and SyllableLM rely on intricate multi-stage training pipelines. We propose ZeroSyl, a simple training-free method to extract syllable boundaries and embeddings directly from a frozen WavLM model. Using L2 norms of features in WavLM's intermediate layers, ZeroSyl achieves competitive syllable segmentation performance. The resulting segments are mean-pooled, discretized using K-means, and used to train a language model. ZeroSyl outperforms prior syllabic tokenizers across lexical, syntactic, and narrative benchmarks. Scaling experiments show that while finer-grained units are beneficial for lexical tasks, our discovered syllabic units exhibit better scaling behavior for syntactic modeling.

Title: Scenario Approach with Post-Design Certification of User-Specified Properties
Authors: Algo Carè, Marco C. Campi, Simone Garatti
Abstract: The scenario approach is an established data-driven design framework that comes equipped with a powerful theory linking design complexity to generalization properties. In this approach, data are simultaneously used both for design and for certifying the design's reliability, without resorting to a separate test dataset. This paper takes a step further by guaranteeing additional properties, useful in post-design usage but not considered during the design phase. To this end, we introduce a two-level framework of appropriateness: baseline appropriateness, which guides the design process, and post-design appropriateness, which serves as a criterion for a posteriori evaluation. We provide distribution-free upper bounds on the risk of failing to meet the post-design appropriateness; these bounds are computable without using any additional test data. Under additional assumptions, lower bounds are also derived. As part of an effort to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed methodology, the paper presents two practical examples in H2 and pole-placement problems. Moreover, a method is provided to infer comprehensive distributional knowledge of relevant performance indexes from the available dataset.

Authors: Qiangong Zhou, Nagasaka Tomohiro
Abstract: This work considers merging two independent models, TTS and A2F, into a unified model to enable internal feature transfer, thereby improving the consistency between audio and facial expressions generated from text. We also discuss the extension of the emotion control mechanism from TTS to the joint model. This work does not aim to showcase generation quality; instead, from a system design perspective, it validates the feasibility of reusing intermediate representations from TTS for joint modeling of speech and facial expressions, and provides engineering practice references for subsequent speech expression co-design.

Title: Estimating Human Muscular Fatigue in Dynamic Collaborative Robotic Tasks with Learning-Based Models
Authors: Feras Kiki, Pouya P. Niaz, Alireza Madani, Cagatay Basdogan
Abstract: Assessing human muscle fatigue is critical for optimizing performance and safety in physical human-robot interaction(pHRI). This work presents a data-driven framework to estimate fatigue in dynamic, cyclic pHRI using arm-mounted surface electromyography(sEMG). Subject-specific machine-learning regression models(Random Forest, XGBoost, and Linear Regression predict the fraction of cycles to fatigue(FCF) from three frequency-domain and one time-domain EMG features, and are benchmarked against a convolutional neural network(CNN) that ingests spectrograms of filtered EMG. Framing fatigue estimation as regression (rather than classification) captures continuous progression toward fatigue, supporting earlier detection, timely intervention, and adaptive robot control. In experiments with ten participants, a collaborative robot under admittance control guided repetitive lateral (left-right) end-effector motions until muscular fatigue. Average FCF RMSE across participants was 20.8+/-4.3% for the CNN, 23.3+/-3.8% for Random Forest, 24.8+/-4.5% for XGBoost, and 26.9+/-6.1% for Linear Regression. To probe cross-task generalization, one participant additionally performed unseen vertical (up-down) and circular repetitions; models trained only on lateral data were tested directly and largely retained accuracy, indicating robustness to changes in movement direction, arm kinematics, and muscle recruitment, while Linear Regression deteriorated. Overall, the study shows that both feature-based ML and spectrogram-based DL can estimate remaining work capacity during repetitive pHRI, with the CNN delivering the lowest error and the tree-based models close behind. The reported transfer to new motion patterns suggests potential for practical fatigue monitoring without retraining for every task, improving operator protection and enabling fatigue-aware shared autonomy, for safer fatigue-adaptive pHRI control.

Title: Controlled oscillation modeling using port-Hamiltonian neural networks
Authors: Maximino Linares, Guillaume Doras, Thomas Hélie
Abstract: Learning dynamical systems through purely data-driven methods is challenging as they do not learn the underlying conservation laws that enable them to correctly generalize. Existing port-Hamiltonian neural network methods have recently been successfully applied for modeling mechanical systems. However, even though these methods are designed on power-balance principles, they usually do not consider power-preserving discretizations and often rely on Runge-Kutta numerical methods. In this work, we propose to use a second-order discrete gradient method embedded in the learning of dynamical systems with port-Hamiltonian neural networks. Numerical results are provided for three systems deliberately selected to span different ranges of dynamical behavior under control: a baseline harmonic oscillator with quadratic energy storage; a Duffing oscillator, with a non-quadratic Hamiltonian offering amplitude-dependent effects; and a self-sustained oscillator, which can stabilize in a controlled limit cycle through the incorporation of a nonlinear dissipation. We show how the use of this discrete gradient method outperforms the performance of a Runge-Kutta method of the same order. Experiments are also carried out to compare two theoretically equivalent port-Hamiltonian systems formulations and to analyze the impact of regularizing the Jacobian of port-Hamiltonian neural networks during training.

Title: Random Wavelet Features for Graph Kernel Machines
Authors: Valentin de Bassompierre, Jean-Charles Delvenne, Laurent Jacques
Abstract: Node embeddings map graph vertices into low-dimensional Euclidean spaces while preserving structural information. They are central to tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and signal reconstruction. A key goal is to design node embeddings whose dot products capture meaningful notions of node similarity induced by the graph. Graph kernels offer a principled way to define such similarities, but their direct computation is often prohibitive for large networks. Inspired by random feature methods for kernel approximation in Euclidean spaces, we introduce randomized spectral node embeddings whose dot products estimate a low-rank approximation of any specific graph kernel. We provide theoretical and empirical results showing that our embeddings achieve more accurate kernel approximations than existing methods, particularly for spectrally localized kernels. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of randomized spectral constructions for scalable and principled graph representation learning.

Title: Spanning the Visual Analogy Space with a Weight Basis of LoRAs
Authors: Hila Manor, Rinon Gal, Haggai Maron, Tomer Michaeli, Gal Chechik
Abstract: Visual analogy learning enables image manipulation through demonstration rather than textual description, allowing users to specify complex transformations difficult to articulate in words. Given a triplet $\{\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{a}'$, $\mathbf{b}\}$, the goal is to generate $\mathbf{b}'$ such that $\mathbf{a} : \mathbf{a}' :: \mathbf{b} : \mathbf{b}'$. Recent methods adapt text-to-image models to this task using a single Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module, but they face a fundamental limitation: attempting to capture the diverse space of visual transformations within a fixed adaptation module constrains generalization capabilities. Inspired by recent work showing that LoRAs in constrained domains span meaningful, interpolatable semantic spaces, we propose LoRWeB, a novel approach that specializes the model for each analogy task at inference time through dynamic composition of learned transformation primitives, informally, choosing a point in a "space of LoRAs". We introduce two key components: (1) a learnable basis of LoRA modules, to span the space of different visual transformations, and (2) a lightweight encoder that dynamically selects and weighs these basis LoRAs based on the input analogy pair. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly improves generalization to unseen visual transformations. Our findings suggest that LoRA basis decompositions are a promising direction for flexible visual manipulation. Code and data are in this https URL

Title: A Generative-First Neural Audio Autoencoder
Authors: Jonah Casebeer, Ge Zhu, Zhepei Wang, Nicholas J. Bryan
Abstract: Neural autoencoders underpin generative models. Practical, large-scale use of neural autoencoders for generative modeling necessitates fast encoding, low latent rates, and a single model across representations. Existing approaches are reconstruction-first: they incur high latent rates, slow encoding, and separate architectures for discrete vs. continuous latents and for different audio channel formats, hindering workflows from preprocessing to inference conditioning. We introduce a generative-first architecture for audio autoencoding that increases temporal downsampling from 2048x to 3360x and supports continuous and discrete representations and common audio channel formats in one model. By balancing compression, quality, and speed, it delivers 10x faster encoding, 1.6x lower rates, and eliminates channel-format-specific variants while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality. This enables applications previously constrained by processing costs: a 60-second mono signal compresses to 788 tokens, making generative modeling more tractable.

Title: Service Orchestration in the Computing Continuum: Structural Challenges and Vision
Authors: Boris Sedlak, Víctor Casamayor Pujol, Ildefons Magrans de Abril, Praveen Kumar Donta, Adel N. Toosi, Schahram Dustdar
Abstract: The Computing Continuum (CC) integrates different layers of processing infrastructure, from Edge to Cloud, to optimize service quality through ubiquitous and reliable computation. Compared to central architectures, however, heterogeneous and dynamic infrastructure increases the complexity for service orchestration. To guide research, this article first summarizes structural problems of the CC, and then, envisions an ideal solution for autonomous service orchestration across the CC. As one instantiation, we show how Active Inference, a concept from neuroscience, can support self-organizing services in continuously interpreting their environment to optimize service quality. Still, we conclude that no existing solution achieves our vision, but that research on service orchestration faces several structural challenges. Most notably: provide standardized simulation and evaluation environments for comparing the performance of orchestration mechanisms. Together, the challenges outline a research roadmap toward resilient and scalable service orchestration in the CC.

Title: Perceptive Humanoid Parkour: Chaining Dynamic Human Skills via Motion Matching
Authors: Zhen Wu, Xiaoyu Huang, Lujie Yang, Yuanhang Zhang, Koushil Sreenath, Xi Chen, Pieter Abbeel, Rocky Duan, Angjoo Kanazawa, Carmelo Sferrazza, Guanya Shi, C. Karen Liu
Abstract: While recent advances in humanoid locomotion have achieved stable walking on varied terrains, capturing the agility and adaptivity of highly dynamic human motions remains an open challenge. In particular, agile parkour in complex environments demands not only low-level robustness, but also human-like motion expressiveness, long-horizon skill composition, and perception-driven decision-making. In this paper, we present Perceptive Humanoid Parkour (PHP), a modular framework that enables humanoid robots to autonomously perform long-horizon, vision-based parkour across challenging obstacle courses. Our approach first leverages motion matching, formulated as nearest-neighbor search in a feature space, to compose retargeted atomic human skills into long-horizon kinematic trajectories. This framework enables the flexible composition and smooth transition of complex skill chains while preserving the elegance and fluidity of dynamic human motions. Next, we train motion-tracking reinforcement learning (RL) expert policies for these composed motions, and distill them into a single depth-based, multi-skill student policy, using a combination of DAgger and RL. Crucially, the combination of perception and skill composition enables autonomous, context-aware decision-making: using only onboard depth sensing and a discrete 2D velocity command, the robot selects and executes whether to step over, climb onto, vault or roll off obstacles of varying geometries and heights. We validate our framework with extensive real-world experiments on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot, demonstrating highly dynamic parkour skills such as climbing tall obstacles up to 1.25m (96% robot height), as well as long-horizon multi-obstacle traversal with closed-loop adaptation to real-time obstacle perturbations.

Title: Non-intrusive data-driven model order reduction for circuits based on Hammerstein architectures
Authors: Joshua Hanson, Paul Kuberry, Biliana Paskaleva, Pavel Bochev
Abstract: We demonstrate that system identification techniques can provide a basis for effective, non-intrusive model order reduction (MOR) for common circuits that are key building blocks in microelectronics. Our approach is motivated by the practical operation of these circuits and utilizes a canonical Hammerstein architecture. To demonstrate the approach we develop parsimonious Hammerstein models for a nonlinear CMOS differential amplifier and an operational amplifier circuit. We train these models on a combination of direct current (DC) and transient Spice circuit simulation data using a novel sequential strategy to identify their static nonlinear and linear dynamical parts. Simulation results show that the Hammerstein model is an effective surrogate for for these types of circuits that accurately and efficiently reproduces their behavior over a wide range of operating points and input frequencies.

Title: Joint Optimization of Multimodal Transit Frequency and Shared Autonomous Vehicle Fleet Size with Hybrid Metaheuristic and Nonlinear Programming
Authors: Max T.M. Ng, Hani S. Mahmassani, Draco Tong, Omer Verbas, Taner Cokyasar
Abstract: Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) bring competition to traditional transit services but redesigning multimodal transit network can utilize SAVs as feeders to enhance service efficiency and coverage. This paper presents an optimization framework for the joint multimodal transit frequency and SAV fleet size problem, a variant of the transit network frequency setting problem. The objective is to maximize total transit ridership (including SAV-fed trips and subtracting boarding rejections) across multiple time periods under budget constraints, considering endogenous mode choice (transit, point-to-point SAVs, driving) and route selection, while allowing for strategic route removal by setting frequencies to zero. Due to the problem's non-linear, non-convex nature and the computational challenges of large-scale networks, we develop a hybrid solution approach that combines a metaheuristic approach (particle swarm optimization) with nonlinear programming for local solution refinement. To ensure computational tractability, the framework integrates analytical approximation models for SAV waiting times based on fleet utilization, multimodal network assignment for route choice, and multinomial logit mode choice behavior, bypassing the need for computationally intensive simulations within the main optimization loop. Applied to the Chicago metropolitan area's multimodal network, our method illustrates a 33.3% increase in transit ridership through optimized transit route frequencies and SAV integration, particularly enhancing off-peak service accessibility and strategically reallocating resources.

Title: Data-Driven Reachability Analysis for Piecewise Affine Systems
Authors: Peng Xie, Johannes Betz, Davide M. Raimondo, Amr Alanwar
Abstract: Hybrid systems play a crucial role in modeling real-world applications where discrete and continuous dynamics interact, including autonomous vehicles, power systems, and traffic networks. Safety verification for these systems requires determining whether system states can enter unsafe regions under given initial conditions and uncertainties, a question directly addressed by reachability analysis. However, hybrid systems present unique difficulties because their state space is divided into multiple regions with distinct dynamic models, causing traditional data-driven methods to produce inadequate over-approximations of reachable sets at region boundaries where dynamics change abruptly. This paper introduces a novel approach using hybrid zonotopes for data-driven reachability analysis of piecewise affine systems. Our method addresses the boundary transition problem by developing computational algorithms that calculate the family of set models guaranteed to contain the true system trajectories. Additionally, we extend and evaluate three methods for set-based estimation that account for input-output data with measurement noise.

Title: Matched Filtering-Based Channel Estimation for AFDM Systems in Doubly Selective Channels
Authors: Xiangjun Li, Zilong Liu, Zhengchun Zhou, Pingzhi Fan
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) has recently emerged as an excellent backward-compatible 6G waveform. In this paper, we study matched filtering (MF) assisted channel estimation (CE) for AFDM systems in complex doubly selective channels. By deriving the complete input-output relationship of the continuous-time signal, the inter-chirp-carrier interference, signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), and the effective SINR loss of AFDM, are investigated in discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) domain. Further, we propose two low-complexity methods for constructing the channel matrix by taking advantage of its inherent discrete Fourier transform structure and the staircase structure of the piecewise functions in the channel matrix, respectively. It is shown that complexity reduction by at least two orders of magnitude can be achieved for a large number of chirp subcarriers. For the CE problem in doubly selective channels, we introduce an MF assisted CE scheme. This allows us to sequentially estimate the parameters of each path by exploiting the separability and approximate orthogonality of different paths in the DAFT domain, thus leading to significantly reduced complexity. Furthermore, based on generalized Fibonacci search (GFS), an MF-GFS scheme is proposed to avoid significantly redundant computation, which can be extended to typical wide-band systems. Extensive simulation results indicate that the proposed schemes offer superior advantages in terms of their improved communication performance and lower complexity.

Title: LLMind 2.0: Distributed IoT Automation with Natural Language M2M Communication and Lightweight LLM Agents
Authors: Yuyang Du, Qun Yang, Liujianfu Wang, Jingqi Lin, Hongwei Cui, Soung Chang Liew
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have generated great interest in their applications for IoT automation and device management. However, centralized approaches struggle to scale across heterogeneous, large-scale systems. We present LLMind 2.0, a distributed framework that embeds lightweight LLM-empowered device agents and adopts natural language for machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. In LLMind 2.0, a central coordinator translates human instructions into natural-language subtask descriptions, which instruct distributed device agents to generate device-specific code locally based on their proprietary APIs. Using natural language as a unified medium overcomes device heterogeneity and enables seamless device collaboration. LLMind 2.0 integrates: 1) a timeout-based deadlock avoidance protocol that coordinates distributed subtask executions, 2) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanism for precise subtask-to-API mapping, and 3) fine-tuned lightweight LLMs for reliable, device-specific code generation. Experiments in multi-robot warehouse operations and Wi Fi network deployments show LLMind 2.0 improved scalability, reliability, and responsiveness compared to centralized baselines.

Title: Interpretable Binaural Deep Beamforming Guided by Time-Varying Relative Transfer Function
Authors: Ilai Zaidel, Sharon Gannot
Abstract: In this work, we propose a deep beamforming framework for speech enhancement in dynamic acoustic environments. The framework learns time-varying beamformer weights from noisy multichannel signals via a deep neural network, guided by a continuously tracked relative transfer function (RTF) of a moving target speaker. We analyze the network's spatial behavior on an 8-microphone linear array by evaluating narrowband and wideband beampatterns in three modes: (i) oracle guidance with true RTFs, (ii) guidance with subspace-tracked RTF estimates, and (iii) operation without RTF guidance. Results show that RTF guidance yields smoother, more spatially consistent beampatterns that track the target direction of arrival (DOA), whereas the unguided model fails to maintain a clear spatial focus. We further extend the framework to binaural beamforming for dynamic target-speaker enhancement. The system is trained using a head-related transfer function (HRTF)-based acoustic simulation of a moving source, enabling realistic spatial rendering at the left and right ears. Spatial cue preservation is quantitatively evaluated in terms of interaural level differences (ILD) and interaural time differences (ITD), demonstrating the method's suitability for hearable applications.

Title: A Mixed Precision FFT with applications in MRI
Authors: Nikhil Deveshwar, Abhejit Rajagopal, Peder E. Z. Larson
Abstract: A mixed precision Fast Fourier transform (FFT) implementation is presented. The procedure uses per-block microscaling (MX), a global power-of-two prescale, and prequantized low bit twiddles. We evaluate forward and round-trip FFT fidelity on two public MRI datasets and compare the effect of various low precision formats, image sizes, and MX block sizes on image quality. Results show that mantissa precision is the primary limiter under MX scaling while ablations suggest weak dependence on image size but a clear block-size trade-off with larger block sizes resulting in better numerical performance.

Title: SNIC: Synthesized Noisy Images using Calibration
Authors: Nik Bhatt
Abstract: Advanced denoising algorithms require large, high-quality datasets. Physically-based statistical noise models can create such datasets by realistically simulating noise in digital images. However, there is little information on the correct way to calibrate and tune these heteroscedastic models, and a lack of published datasets using them. In this paper, we explore the process of building high-quality heteroscedastic noise models. Our methods produce realistic synthesized noisy images in both RAW and TIFF formats. Our synthesized noisy images achieve comparable LPIPS results to real noisy images; when tested with a state-of-the-art denoising model, our images reduce the PSNR gap versus real noise by 54-64% compared to those synthesized using manufacturer-provided DNG noise models. Using our approach, we created the Synthesized Noisy Images using Calibration dataset (SNIC) containing over 6000 noisy images, comprising 30 scenes from four sensors, including two smartphone sensors, a point-and-shoot, and a DSLR. SNIC is the first synthesized noisy image dataset provided in both RAW and TIFF format.

Title: Robust H-infinity control under stochastic requirements: minimizing conditional value-at-risk instead of worst-case performance
Authors: Ervan Kassarian, Francesco Sanfedino, Daniel Alazard, Andrea Marrazza
Abstract: Conventional robust $\mathcal H_2/\mathcal H_\infty$ control minimizes the worst-case performance, often leading to a conservative design driven by very rare parametric configurations. To reduce this conservatism while taking advantage of the stochastic properties of Monte-Carlo sampling and its compatibility with parallel computing, we introduce an alternative paradigm that optimizes the controller with respect to a stochastic criterion, namely the conditional value at risk. We illustrate the potential of this approach on a realistic satellite benchmark, showing that it can significantly improve overall performance by tolerating some degradation in very rare worst-case scenarios.

Title: A Covariance Matching Approach to Graph Topology Identification
Authors: Yongsheng Han, Raj Thilak Rajan, Geert Leus
Abstract: Graph topology identification (GTI) is a central challenge in networked systems, where the underlying structure is often hidden, yet nodal data are available. Conventional solutions to address these challenges rely on probabilistic models or complex optimization formulations, commonly suffering from non-convexity or requiring restrictive assumptions on acyclicity or positivity. In this paper, we propose a novel covariance matching (CovMatch) framework that directly aligns the empirical covariance of the observed data with the theoretical covariance implied by an underlying graph. We show that as long as the data-generating process permits an explicit covariance expression, CovMatch offers a unified route to topology inference. We showcase our methodology on linear structural equation models (SEMs), showing that CovMatch naturally handles both undirected and general sparse directed graphs - whether acyclic or positively weighted - without explicit knowledge of these structural constraints. Through appropriate reparameterizations, CovMatch simplifies the graph learning problem to either a conic mixed integer program for undirected graphs or an orthogonal matrix optimization for directed graphs. Numerical results confirm that, even for relatively large graphs, our approach efficiently recovers the true topology and outperforms standard baselines in accuracy. These findings highlight CovMatch as a powerful alternative to log-determinant or Bayesian methods for GTI, paving the way for broader research on learning complex network topologies with minimal assumptions.

Title: Sub Specie Aeternitatis: Fourier Transforms from the Theory of Heat to Musical Signals
Authors: Victor Lazzarini
Abstract: J. B. Fourier in his \emph{Théorie Analytique de la Chaleur} of 1822 introduced, amongst other things, two ideas that have made a fundamental impact in fields as diverse as Mathematical Physics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Music. The first one of these, a method to find the coefficients for a trigonometric series describing an arbitrary function, was very early on picked up by G. Ohm and H. Helmholtz as the foundation for a theory of \emph{musical tones}. The second one, which is described by Fourier's double integral, became the basis for treating certain kinds of infinity in discontinuous functions, as shown by A. De Morgan in his 1842 \emph{The Differential and Integral Calculus}. Both make up the fundamental basis for what is now commonly known as the \emph{Fourier theorem}. With the help of P. A. M. Dirac's insights into the nature of these infinities, we can have a compact description of the frequency spectrum of a function of time, or conversely of a waveform corresponding to a given function of frequency. This paper, using solely primary sources, takes us from the physics of heat propagation to the modern theory of musical signals. It concludes with some considerations on the inherent duality of time and frequency emerging from Fourier's theorem.

Title: Scan-Adaptive Dynamic MRI Undersampling Using a Dictionary of Efficiently Learned Patterns
Authors: Siddhant Gautam, Angqi Li, Prachi P. Agarwal, Anil K. Attili, Jeffrey A. Fessler, Nicole Seiberlich, Saiprasad Ravishankar
Abstract: Cardiac MRI is limited by long acquisition times, which can lead to patient discomfort and motion artifacts. We aim to accelerate Cartesian dynamic cardiac MRI by learning efficient, scan-adaptive undersampling patterns that preserve diagnostic image quality. We develop a learning-based framework for designing scan- or slice-adaptive Cartesian undersampling masks tailored to dynamic cardiac MRI. Undersampling patterns are optimized using fully sampled training dynamic time-series data. At inference time, a nearest-neighbor search in low-frequency $k$-space selects an optimized mask from a dictionary of learned patterns. Our learned sampling approach improves reconstruction quality across multiple acceleration factors on public and in-house cardiac MRI datasets, including PSNR gains of 2-3 dB, reduced NMSE, improved SSIM, and higher radiologist ratings. The proposed scan-adaptive sampling framework enables faster and higher-quality dynamic cardiac MRI by adapting $k$-space sampling to individual scans.

Title: A model predictive control framework with robust stability guarantees under unbounded disturbances
Authors: Johannes Köhler, Melanie N. Zeilinger
Abstract: To address feasibility issues in model predictive control (MPC), most implementations relax state constraints by using slack variables and adding a penalty to the cost. We propose an alternative strategy: relaxing the initial state constraint with a penalty. Compared to state-of-the-art soft constrained MPC formulations, the proposed formulation has two key features: (i) input-to-state stability and bounds on the cumulative constraint violation for unbounded disturbances; (ii) close-to-optimal performance under nominal operating conditions. The idea is initially presented for open-loop asymptotically stable nonlinear systems by designing the penalty as a Lyapunov function, but we also show how to relax this condition to: i) Lyapunov stable systems; ii) stabilizable systems; and iii) utilizing an implicit characterization of the Lyapunov function. In the special case of linear systems, the proposed MPC formulation reduces to a quadratic program, and the offline design and online computational complexity are only marginally increased compared to a nominal design. Numerical examples demonstrate benefits compared to state-of-the-art soft-constrained MPC formulations.

Title: Satellite Autonomous Clock Fault Monitoring with Inter-Satellite Ranges Using Euclidean Distance Matrices
Authors: Keidai Iiyama, Daniel Neamati, Grace Gao
Abstract: To address the need for robust positioning, navigation, and timing services in lunar environments, this paper proposes a novel onboard clock phase jump detection framework for satellite constellations using range measurements obtained from dual one-way inter-satellite links. Our approach leverages vertex redundantly rigid graphs to detect faults without relying on prior knowledge of satellite positions or clock biases, providing flexibility for lunar satellite networks with diverse satellite types and operators. We model satellite constellations as graphs, where satellites are vertices and inter-satellite links are edges. The proposed algorithm detects and identifies satellites with clock jumps by monitoring the singular values of the geometric-centered Euclidean distance matrix (GCEDM) of 5-clique sub-graphs. The proposed method is validated through simulations of a GPS constellation and a notional constellation around the Moon, demonstrating its effectiveness in various configurations.

Title: Prescribed Performance Control of Unknown Euler-Lagrange Systems Under Input Constraints
Authors: Ratnangshu Das, Pushpak Jagtap
Abstract: In this paper, we present a prescribed performance control framework for trajectory tracking in Euler-Lagrange systems with unknown dynamics and prescribed input constraints. The proposed approach enforces hard funnel constraints, meaning that the prescribed performance bounds must not be violated during operation. We derive feasibility conditions that guarantee the tracking error evolves within these predefined funnels while ensuring bounded control inputs. To handle situations where the feasibility conditions are not satisfied, we introduce two approximation-free control strategies: one that actively drives the error back toward the funnel and another that prioritizes safety by preventing further deviation. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method are demonstrated through simulation studies and hardware experiments, highlighting its suitability for real-world robotic systems operating under strict input limits.

Title: Token-Based Audio Inpainting via Discrete Diffusion
Authors: Tali Dror, Iftach Shoham, Moshe Buchris, Oren Gal, Haim Permuter, Gilad Katz, Eliya Nachmani
Abstract: Audio inpainting seeks to restore missing segments in degraded recordings. Previous diffusion-based methods exhibit impaired performance when the missing region is large. We introduce the first approach that applies discrete diffusion over tokenized music representations from a pre-trained audio tokenizer, enabling stable and semantically coherent restoration of long gaps. Our method further incorporates two training approaches: a derivative-based regularization loss that enforces smooth temporal dynamics, and a span-based absorbing transition that provides structured corruption during diffusion. Experiments on the MusicNet and MAESTRO datasets with gaps up to 750 ms show that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines across range of gap lengths, for gaps of 150 ms and above. This work advances musical audio restoration and introduces new directions for discrete diffusion model training. Visit our project page for examples and code.

Title: XAI-Driven Spectral Analysis of Cough Sounds for Respiratory Disease Characterization
Authors: Patricia Amado-Caballero, Luis Miguel San-José-Revuelta, María Dolores Aguilar-García, José Ramón Garmendia-Leiza, Carlos Alberola-López, Pablo Casaseca-de-la-Higuera
Abstract: This paper proposes an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)-driven methodology to enhance the understanding of cough sound analysis for respiratory disease management. We employ occlusion maps to highlight relevant spectral regions in cough spectrograms processed by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Subsequently, spectral analysis of spectrograms weighted by these occlusion maps reveals significant differences between disease groups, particularly in patients with COPD, where cough patterns appear more variable in the identified spectral regions of interest. This contrasts with the lack of significant differences observed when analyzing raw spectrograms. The proposed approach extracts and analyzes several spectral features, demonstrating the potential of XAI techniques to uncover disease-specific acoustic signatures and improve the diagnostic capabilities of cough sound analysis by providing more interpretable results.

Title: A XAI-based Framework for Frequency Subband Characterization of Cough Spectrograms in Chronic Respiratory Disease
Authors: Patricia Amado-Caballero, Luis M. San-José-Revuelta, Xinheng Wang, José Ramón Garmendia-Leiza, Carlos Alberola-López, Pablo Casaseca-de-la-Higuera
Abstract: This paper presents an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based framework for the spectral analysis of cough sounds associated with chronic respiratory diseases, with a particular focus on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on time-frequency representations of cough signals, and occlusion maps are used to identify diagnostically relevant regions within the spectrograms. These highlighted areas are subsequently decomposed into five frequency subbands, enabling targeted spectral feature extraction and analysis. The results reveal that spectral patterns differ across subbands and disease groups, uncovering complementary and compensatory trends across the frequency spectrum. Noteworthy, the approach distinguishes COPD from other respiratory conditions, and chronic from non-chronic patient groups, based on interpretable spectral markers. These findings provide insight into the underlying pathophysiological characteristics of cough acoustics and demonstrate the value of frequency-resolved, XAI-enhanced analysis for biomedical signal interpretation and translational respiratory disease diagnostics.

Title: MARLIN: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Murmuration Intelligence and LLM Guidance for Reservoir Management
Authors: Heming Fu, Guojun Xiong, Shan Lin
Abstract: As climate change intensifies extreme weather events, water disasters pose growing threats to global communities, making adaptive reservoir management critical for protecting vulnerable populations and ensuring water security. Modern water resource management faces unprecedented challenges from cascading uncertainties propagating through interconnected reservoir networks. These uncertainties, rooted in physical water transfer losses and environmental variability, make precise control difficult. For example, sending 10 tons downstream may yield only 8-12 tons due to evaporation and seepage. Traditional centralized optimization approaches suffer from exponential computational complexity and cannot effectively handle such real-world uncertainties, while existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods fail to achieve effective coordination under uncertainty. To address these challenges, we present MARLIN, a decentralized reservoir management framework inspired by starling murmurations intelligence. Integrating bio-inspired alignment, separation, and cohesion rules with MARL, MARLIN enables individual reservoirs to make local decisions while achieving emergent global coordination. In addition, a LLM provides real-time reward shaping signals, guiding agents to adapt to environmental changes and human-defined preferences. Experiments on USGS data show that MARLIN improves uncertainty handling by 23\%, cuts computation by 35\%, and accelerates flood response by 68\%, exhibiting super-linear coordination, with complexity scaling 5.4x from 400 to 10,000 nodes. These results demonstrate MARLIN's potential for disaster prevention and protecting communities through intelligent, scalable water resource management.

Title: Improving Variational Autoencoder using Random Fourier Transformation: An Aviation Safety Anomaly Detection Case-Study
Authors: Ata Akbari Asanjan, Milad Memarzadeh, Bryan Matthews, Nikunj Oza
Abstract: In this study, we focus on the training process and inference improvements of deep neural networks (DNNs), specifically Autoencoders (AEs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), using Random Fourier Transformation (RFT). We further explore the role of RFT in model training behavior using Frequency Principle (F-Principle) analysis and show that models with RFT turn to learn low frequency and high frequency at the same time, whereas conventional DNNs start from low frequency and gradually learn (if successful) high-frequency features. We focus on reconstruction-based anomaly detection using autoencoder and variational autoencoder and investigate the RFT's role. We also introduced a trainable variant of RFT that uses the existing computation graph to train the expansion of RFT instead of it being random. We showcase our findings with two low-dimensional synthetic datasets for data representation, and an aviation safety dataset, called Dashlink, for high-dimensional reconstruction-based anomaly detection. The results indicate the superiority of models with Fourier transformation compared to the conventional counterpart and remain inconclusive regarding the benefits of using trainable Fourier transformation in contrast to the Random variant.

Title: CONSENT: A Negotiation Framework for Leveraging User Flexibility in Vehicle-to-Building Charging under Uncertainty
Authors: Rishav Sen, Fangqi Liu, Jose Paolo Talusan, Ava Pettet, Yoshinori Suzue, Mark Bailey, Ayan Mukhopadhyay, Abhishek Dubey
Abstract: The growth of Electric Vehicles (EVs) creates a conflict in vehicle-to-building (V2B) settings between building operators, who face high energy costs from uncoordinated charging, and drivers, who prioritize convenience and a full charge. To resolve this, we propose a negotiation-based framework that, by design, guarantees voluntary participation, strategy-proofness, and budget feasibility. It transforms EV charging into a strategic resource by offering drivers a range of incentive-backed options for modest flexibility in their departure time or requested state of charge (SoC). Our framework is calibrated with user survey data and validated using real operational data from a commercial building and an EV manufacturer. Simulations show that our negotiation protocol creates a mutually beneficial outcome: lowering the building operator's costs by over 3.5\% compared to an optimized, non-negotiating smart charging policy, while simultaneously reducing user charging expenses by 22\% below the utility's retail energy rate. By aligning operator and EV user objectives, our framework provides a strategic bridge between energy and mobility systems, transforming EV charging from a source of operational friction into a platform for collaboration and shared savings.

Title: Online Fine-Tuning of Pretrained Controllers for Autonomous Driving via Real-Time Recurrent RL
Authors: Julian Lemmel, Felix Resch, Mónika Farsang, Ramin Hasani, Daniela Rus, Radu Grosu
Abstract: Deploying pretrained policies in real-world applications presents substantial challenges that fundamentally limit the practical applicability of learning-based control systems. When autonomous systems encounter environmental changes in system dynamics, sensor drift, or task objectives, fixed policies rapidly degrade in performance. We show that employing Real-Time Recurrent Reinforcement Learning (RTRRL), a biologically plausible algorithm for online adaptation, can effectively fine-tune a pretrained policy to improve autonomous agents' performance on driving tasks. We further show that RTRRL synergizes with a recent biologically inspired recurrent network model, the Liquid-Resistance Liquid-Capacitance RNN. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this closed-loop approach in a simulated CarRacing environment and in a real-world line-following task with a RoboRacer car equipped with an event camera.
