Title: Dual radar-guided glide path error correction based on the Izhikevich neuron model
Authors: Yuan Gao, Xinyu Wang, Yifan Ren, Yuning Zhou, Ziwei Wang
Abstract: Aiming at the ranging and angle measurement errors caused by target reflection characteristics and system noise in dual radar tracking, this paper proposes a dual radar track error correction method based on the Izhikevich neural model. The network uses the dynamic differential equation of the Izhikevich model to simulate the discharge characteristics of biological neurons. Its input layer integrates the coordinate measurement data of the dual radar, and the output layer represents the error compensation amount through the pulse emission frequency. The spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is used to adjust the neuron connection weights dynamically, and the trajectory distortion caused by system noise and radar ranging and angle measurement errors can be effectively suppressed.

Title: Optimizing the 4G--5G Migration: A Simulation-Driven Roadmap for Emerging Markets
Authors: Desire Guel, Justin Pegd-Windé Kouraogo, Kouka Kouakou Nakoulma
Abstract: Deploying fifth-generation (5G) networks in emerging markets demands a balance between performance targets and constraints in budget, spectrum, and infrastructure. We use MATLAB simulations to quantify how radio and architectural levers - MIMO (beamforming, diversity, spatial multiplexing), carrier aggregation (CA), targeted spectrum refarming to New Radio (NR), mmWave propagation with blockage/rain, and Non-Standalone (NSA) versus Standalone (SA) cores - affect capacity, coverage, latency, and interference robustness, with D2D and M2M as complements to wide-area access. Beamforming improves cell-edge SNR by about 3-6 dB, while spatial multiplexing dominates at moderate/high SNR via multi-stream gains. Throughput scales strongly with CA: increasing from 1 to 5x20-MHz carriers raises peak rate from about 200 Mb/s to about 1 Gb/s at 30 dB SNR; water-filling adds 5-12% over equal power at mid-SNR. Targeted mid-band refarming to NR increases median throughput by 60-90% in urban and 40-70% in rural scenarios when sub-1-GHz layers preserve coverage. At 28 GHz, rain and human blockage add about 8-30 dB excess loss, so viable mmWave deployment concentrates in LOS hot zones with narrow-beam arrays and short inter-site distances. NSA delivers broader initial coverage than SA by reusing LTE/EPC, while SA becomes attractive as transport improves (e.g., >= 10 Gb/s and < 5 ms RTT) and site density grows. We synthesize these results into a practical roadmap: start NR on NSA, prioritize CA-centric spectrum strategies with focused refarming, densify selectively in demand hotspots, and migrate to SA as backhaul and device ecosystems mature.

Title: Auditory Filter Behavior and Updated Estimated Constants
Authors: Samiya A Alkhairy
Abstract: Filters from the Gammatone family are often used to model auditory signal processing, but the filter constant values used to mimic human hearing are largely set to values based on historical psychoacoustic data collected several decades ago. Here, we move away from this long-standing convention, and estimate filter constants using a range of more recent reported filter characteristics (such as quality factors and ratios between quality factors and peak group delay) within a characteristics-based framework that clarifies how filter behavior is related to the underlying constants. Using a sharp-filter approximation that captures shared peak-region behavior across certain classes of filters, we analyze the range of behaviors accessible when the full degrees of freedom of the filter are utilized rather than fixing the filter order or exponent to historically prescribed values. Filter behavior is characterized using magnitude-based and phase-based characteristics and their ratios, which reveal which characteristics are informative for constraining filter constants and which are only weakly constraining. We show that these insights and estimation methods extend to multiple realizable filter classes from the Gammatone family and apply them, together with recent physiological and psychoacoustic observations, to derive constraints on and estimates for filter constants for human auditory filters. More broadly, this framework supports the design of auditory filters with arbitrary characteristic-level specifications and enables systematic assessment of how variations in filter characteristics influence auditory models, perceptual findings, and technologies that rely on auditory filterbanks.

Title: Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding for Wireless Video Transmission with Asymmetric Context
Authors: Xuechen Chen, Junting Li, Chuang Chen, Hairong Lin, Yishen Li
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a high-efficiency deep joint source-channel coding (JSCC) method for video transmission based on conditional coding with asymmetric context. The conditional coding-based neural video compression requires to predict the encoding and decoding conditions from the same context which includes the same reconstructed frames. However in JSCC schemes which fall into pseudo-analog transmission, the encoder cannot infer the same reconstructed frames as the decoder even a pipeline of the simulated transmission is constructed at the encoder. In the proposed method, without such a pipeline, we guide and design neural networks to learn encoding and decoding conditions from asymmetric contexts. Additionally, we introduce feature propagation, which allows intermediate features to be independently propagated at the encoder and decoder and help to generate conditions, enabling the framework to greatly leverage temporal correlation while mitigating the problem of error accumulation. To further exploit the performance of the proposed transmission framework, we implement content-adaptive coding which achieves variable bandwidth transmission using entropy models and masking mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing deep video transmission frameworks in terms of performance and effectively mitigates the error accumulation. By mitigating the error accumulation, our schemes can reduce the frequency of inserting intra-frame coding modes, further enhancing performance.

Title: FastSLM: Hierarchical Frame Q-Former for Effective Speech Modality Adaptation
Authors: Junseok Lee, Sangyong Lee, Chang-Jae Chun
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated human-expert-level capabilities, driving significant interest in their potential for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). In particular, there is growing momentum in adapting LLMs to various modalities, including vision, video, and speech, through the development of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). However, existing speech-language model (SLM) research has largely overlooked cost-effective adaptation strategies for leveraging LLMs in the speech domain. In this paper, we propose FastSLM, a lightweight yet efficient SLM designed for effective understanding and reasoning over long-form speech. To address the challenge of aligning high-frame-rate speech features with LLMs, we introduce the Hierarchical Frame Querying Transformer (HFQ-Former), which compresses frame-level speech features while capturing both local and global context. Furthermore, we present a novel three-stage training strategy that enhances generalization across a wide range of speech-related tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that FastSLM achieves competitive performance compared to existing state-of-the-art models, despite operating with significantly lower FLOPs and parameter counts, while representing speech with only 1.67 tokens per second.

Title: Real-Time Image Processing Algorithms for Embedded Systems
Authors: Soundes Oumaima Boufaida, Abdemadjid Benmachiche, Majda Maatallah
Abstract: Embedded vision systems need efficient and robust image processing algorithms to perform real-time, with resource-constrained hardware. This research investigates image processing algorithms, specifically edge detection, corner detection, and blob detection, that are implemented on embedded processors, including DSPs and FPGAs. To address latency, accuracy and power consumption noted in the image processing literature, optimized algorithm architectures and quantization techniques are employed. In addition, optimal techniques for inter-frame redundancy removal and adaptive frame averaging are used to improve throughput with reasonable image quality. Simulations and hardware trials of the proposed approaches show marked improvements in the speed and energy efficiency of processing as compared to conventional implementations. The advances of this research facilitate a path for scalable and inexpensive embedded imaging systems for the automotive, surveillance, and robotics sectors, and underscore the benefit of co-designing algorithms and hardware architectures for practical real-time embedded vision applications.

Title: Performance Analysis of DCT, Hadamard, and PCA in Block-Based Image Compression
Authors: Yashika Ahlawat
Abstract: Block based image compression relies on transform coding to concentrate signal energy into a small number of coefficients. While classical codecs use fixed transforms such as the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), data driven methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are theoretically optimal for decorrelation. This paper presents an experimental comparison of DCT, Hadamard, and PCA across multiple block sizes and compression rates. Using rate distortion and energy compaction analysis, we show that PCA outperforms fixed transforms only when block dimensionality is sufficiently large, while DCT remains near optimal for standard block sizes such as $8\times8$ and at low bit rates. These results explain the robustness of DCT in practical codecs and highlight the limitations of block wise learned transforms.

Title: Timing Fragility Aware Selective Hardening of RISCV Soft Processors on SRAM Based FPGAs
Authors: Mostafa Darvishi
Abstract: Selective hardening is widely employed to improve the reliability of FPGA based soft processors while limiting the overhead of full redundancy. However, existing approaches primarily rely on architectural criticality or functional fault analysis, overlooking the impact of routing dependent timing sensitivity on processor robustness. This paper introduces a timing fragility aware selective hardening methodology for RISCV soft processors implemented on SRAM based FPGAs. Building on recent advances in in situ timing observability, the proposed approach quantifies the statistical timing sensitivity of pipeline components under controlled routing perturbations and uses this information to guide hardening decisions. Experimental results on a RISCV processor implemented on a commercial FPGA platform show that components exhibiting higher timing fragility also demonstrate increased vulnerability to routing induced delay effects. Leveraging this correlation, the proposed selective hardening strategy achieves robustness comparable to full hardening while significantly reducing area and timing overhead. These results demonstrate that timing fragility provides a practical and effective metric for reliability aware design optimization in FPGA based processor architectures.

Title: Koopman Model Dimension Reduction via Variational Bayesian Inference and Graph Search
Authors: Selin Ezgi Ozcan, Mustafa Mert Ankarali
Abstract: Koopman operator recently gained increasing attention in the control systems community for its abilities to bridge linear and nonlinear systems. Data driven Koopman operator approximations have established themselves as key enablers for system identification and model predictive control. Nonetheless, such methods commonly entail a preselected definition of states in the function space leading to high dimensional overfitting models and degraded long term prediction performances. We address this problem by proposing a hierarchical probabilistic approach for the Koopman model identification problem. In our method, elements of the model are treated as random variables and the posterior estimates are found using variational Bayesian (VB) inference updates. Our model distinguishes from others in the integration of inclusion flags. By the help of the inclusion flags, we intuitively threshold the probability of each state in the model. We then propose a graph search based algorithm to reduce the preselected states of the Koopman model. We demonstrate that our reduction method overcomes numerical instabilities and the reduced models maintain performance in simulated and real experiments.

Title: A Data-Driven Surrogate Modeling and Sensor/Actuator Placement Framework for Flexible Spacecraft
Authors: Matthew Hilsenrath, Daniel R. Herber
Abstract: Flexible spacecraft structures present significant challenges for physical and control system design due to nonlinear dynamics, mission constraints, environmental variables, and changing operational conditions. This paper presents a data-driven framework for constructing reduced-order surrogate models of a flexible spacecraft using the method of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), followed by optimal sensor/actuator pair placement. Highfidelity simulation data from a nonlinear flexible spacecraft model, including coupled rigid-body and elastic modes, are captured by defining a mesh of nodes over the spacecraft body. The data-driven methods are then used to construct a modal model from the time histories of these node points. Optimal sensor/actuator placement for controllability and observability is performed via a nonlinear programming technique that maximizes the singular values of the Hankel matrix. Finally, the sensor placement and dynamics modeling approach is iterated to account for changes in the dynamic system introduced by sensor/actuator physical mass. The proposed methodology enables initialization of physical modeling without requiring a direct analytical model and provides a practical solution for onboard implementation in model-based control and estimation systems. Results demonstrate optimal design methodology with substantial model-order reduction while preserving dynamic fidelity, and provide insight into effective sensor-actuator configurations for estimation and control.

Title: Building Envelope Inversion by Data-driven Interpretation of Ground Penetrating Radar
Authors: Ahmed Nirjhar Alam, Wesley Reinhart, Rebecca Napolitano
Abstract: Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) combines depth resolution, non-destructive operation, and broad material sensitivity, yet it has seen limited use in diagnosing building envelopes. The compact geometry of wall assemblies, where reflections from closely spaced studs, sheathing, and cladding strongly overlap, has made systematic inversion difficult. Recent advances in data-driven interpretation provide an opportunity to revisit this challenge and assess whether machine learning can reliably extract structural information from such complex signals. Here, we develop a GPR-based inversion framework that decomposes wall diagnostics into classification tasks addressing vertical (stud presence) and lateral (wall-type) variations. Alongside model development, we implement multiple feature minimization strategies - including recursive elimination, agglomerative clustering, and L0-based sparsity - to promote fidelity and interpretability. Among these approaches, the L0-based sparse neural network (SparseNN) emerges as particularly effective: it exceeds Random Forest accuracy while relying on only a fraction of the input features, each linked to identifiable dielectric interfaces. SHAP analysis further confirms that the SparseNN learns reflection patterns consistent with physical layer boundaries. In summary, this framework establishes a foundation for physically interpretable and data-efficient inversion of wall assemblies using GPR radargrams. Although defect detection is not addressed here, the ability to reconstruct intact envelope structure and isolate features tied to key elements provides a necessary baseline for future inversion and anomaly-analysis tasks.

Title: Performance Analysis for Wireless Localization with Random Sensor Network
Authors: Mengqi Ma, Aihua Xia
Abstract: Accurate wireless localization underpins applications from autonomous systems to smart infrastructure. We study the mean-squared error (MSE) and conditional MSE (CMSE) of a practical fusion-based estimator in d-dimensional, stationary isotropic (translation- and rotation-invariant) random sensor networks, where a central processor combines received-signal-strength (RSS) and angle-of-arrival (AOA) measurements to infer a target's position. Our contributions are twofold. First, we establish an approximation theorem: when measurement noise is sufficiently large, the joint law of RSS and AOA observations under a broad class of stationary isotropic deployments is, in distribution, indistinguishable from that induced by a homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP). Second, leveraging this equivalence, we investigate a homogeneous PPP-based sensor network. We propose a fusion-based estimator in which a central processor aggregates RSS and AOA measurements from a set of spatially distributed sensors to infer the target position. For this PPP deployment within a finite observation region, we derive tractable analytical upper bounds for both the MSE and CMSE, establishing explicit scaling laws with respect to sensor density, observation radius, and noise variance. The approximation theorem then certifies these PPP-based bounds as reasonable proxies for non-Poisson deployments in noisy regimes. Overall, the results translate deployment and sensing parameters into achievable accuracy targets and provide robust, cost-aware guidance for the design of next-generation location-aware wireless networks.

Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning based Control Design for Aircraft Recovery from Loss-of-Control Scenario
Authors: Imran Sayyed, Aayush Konar, Nandan Kumar Sinha
Abstract: Loss-of-control (LOC) remains a leading cause of fixed-wing aircraft accidents, especially in post-stall and flat-spin regimes where conventional gain-scheduled or logic-based recovery laws may fail. This study formulates spin-recovery as a continuous-state, continuous-action Markov Decision Process and trains a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent on a high-fidelity six-degree-of-freedom F-18/HARV model that includes nonlinear aerodynamics, actuator saturation and rate coupling. A two-phase potential-based reward structure first penalizes large angular rates and then enforces trimmed flight. After 6,000 simulated episodes, the policy generalities to unseen upset initializations. Results show that the learned policy successfully arrests the angular rates and stabilizes the angle of attack. The controller performance is observed to be satisfactory for recovery from spin condition which was compared with a state-of-the-art sliding mode controller. The findings demonstrate that deep reinforcement learning can deliver interpretable, dynamically feasible manoeuvres for real-time loss of control mitigation and provide a pathway for flight-critical RL deployment.

Title: R$^3$D: Regional-guided Residual Radar Diffusion
Authors: Hao Li, Xinqi Liu, Yaoqing Jin
Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar enables robust environment perception in autonomous systems under adverse conditions yet suffers from sparse, noisy point clouds with low angular resolution. Existing diffusion-based radar enhancement methods either incur high learning complexity by modeling full LiDAR distributions or fail to prioritize critical structures due to uniform regional processing. To address these issues, we propose R3D, a regional-guided residual radar diffusion framework that integrates residual diffusion modeling-focusing on the concentrated LiDAR-radar residual encoding complementary high-frequency details to reduce learning difficulty-and sigma-adaptive regional guidance-leveraging radar-specific signal properties to generate attention maps and applying lightweight guidance only in low-noise stages to avoid gradient imbalance while refining key regions. Extensive experiments on the ColoRadar dataset demonstrate that R3D outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing a practical solution for radar perception enhancement.

Title: Neuro-Wideband WiFi Sensing via Self-Conditioned CSI Extrapolation
Authors: Sijie Ji, Weiying Hou, Chenshu Wu
Abstract: WiFi sensing has suffered from the limited bandwidths designated for its original communication purpose, leading to fundamental limits in multipath resolution and thus multi-user sensing. Unfortunately, it is practically prohibitive to obtain large bandwidths on commercial WiFi, considering the conflict between the limited spectrum and the crowded networks. In this paper, we present Neuro-Wideband (NWB), a completely different paradigm that enables wideband WiFi sensing without specialized hardware or extra channel measurements. Our key insight is that any physical measurement of channel state information (CSI) inherently encapsulates multipath parameters, which, while unsolvable in isolation, can be transformed into an expanded form of CSI (eCSI) approximating measurements over a broader bandwidth. To ground this insight, we propose WUKONG to address NWB as a unique self-conditioned learning problem that can be trained by using any existing CSI data as self-labeled samples. WUKONG introduces a novel deep learning framework by integrating Transformer and Diffusion models, which captures sample-specific multipath parameters and transfers this sample-level knowledge to the outcome eCSI. We conduct real-world experiments to evaluate WUKONG on diverse WiFi signals across protocols and bandwidths. The results show the promising effectiveness of NWB, which is further demonstrated through case studies on localization and multi-person breathing monitoring using eCSI. Overall, the proposed NWB promises a practical pathway toward realizing wideband WiFi sensing on commodity hardware, expanding the design space of wireless sensing systems.

Title: Hybrid LSTM-UKF Framework: Ankle Angle and Ground Reaction Force Estimation
Authors: Mundla Narasimhappa, Praveen Kumar
Abstract: Accurate prediction of joint kinematics and kinetics is essential for advancing gait analysis and developing intelligent assistive systems such as prosthetics and exoskeletons. This study presents a hybrid LSTM-UKF framework for estimating ankle angle and ground reaction force (GRF) across varying walking speeds. A multimodal sensor fusion strategy integrates force plate data, knee angle, and GRF signals to enrich biomechanical context. Model performance was evaluated using RMSE and $R^2$ under subject-specific validation. The LSTM-UKF consistently outperformed standalone LSTM and UKF models, achieving up to 18.6\% lower RMSE for GRF prediction at 3 km/h. Additionally, UKF integration improved robustness, reducing ankle angle RMSE by up to 22.4\% compared to UKF alone at 1 km/h. These results underscore the effectiveness of hybrid architectures for reliable gait prediction across subjects and walking conditions.

Title: Joint Impact of ADC and Fronthaul Quantization in Cell-Free Massive MIMO-OFDM Uplink
Authors: Özlem Tuğfe Demir, Emil Björnson
Abstract: In the uplink of a cell-free massive MIMO system, quantization affects performance in two key domains: the time-domain distortion introduced by finite-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) at the access points (APs), and the fronthaul quantization of signals sent to the central processing unit (CPU). Although quantizing twice may seem redundant, the ADC quantization in orthogonal frequency-division duplex (OFDM) systems appears in the time domain, and one must then convert to the frequency domain, where quantization can be applied only to the signals at active subcarriers. This reduces fronthaul load and avoids unnecessary distortion, since the ADC output spans all OFDM samples while only a subset of subcarriers carries useful information. While both quantization effects have been extensively studied in narrowband systems, their joint impact in practical wideband OFDM-based cell-free massive MIMO remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses the gap by modeling the joint distortion and proposing a fronthaul strategy in which each AP processes the received signal to reduce quantization artifacts before transmission. We develop an efficient estimation algorithm that reconstructs the unquantized time-domain signal prior to fronthaul transmission and evaluate its effectiveness. The proposed design offers new insights for implementing efficient, quantization-aware uplink transmission in wideband cell-free architectures.

Title: Coupling Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics with Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Cooperative Control of Point Absorbers
Authors: Yi Zhan, Iván Martínez-Estévez, Min Luo, Alejandro J.C. Crespo, Abbas Khayyer
Abstract: Wave Energy Converters, particularly point absorbers, have emerged as one of the most promising technologies for harvesting ocean wave energy. Nevertheless, achieving high conversion efficiency remains challenging due to the inherently complex and nonlinear interactions between incident waves and device motion dynamics. This study develops an optimal adaptive damping control model for the power take-off (PTO) system by coupling Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) with multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. The proposed framework enables real-time communication between high-fidelity SPH simulations and intelligent control agents that learn coordinated policies to maximise energy capture. In each training episode, the SPH-based environment provides instantaneous hydrodynamic states to the agents, which output continuous damping actions and receive rewards reflecting power absorption. The Multi-Agent Soft Actor Critic algorithm is employed within a centralised-training and decentralised-execution scheme to ensure stable learning in continuous, multi-body systems. The entire platform is implemented in a unified GPU-accelerated C++ environment, allowing long-horizon training and large-scale three-dimensional simulations. The approach is validated through a series of two-dimensional and three-dimensional benchmark cases under regular and irregular wave conditions. Compared with constant PTO damping, the learned control policy increases overall energy capture by 23.8% and 21.5%, respectively, demonstrating the strong potential of intelligent control for improving the performance of wave energy converter arrays. The developed three-dimensional GPU-accelerated multi-agent platform in computational hydrodynamics, is extendable to other fluid-structure interaction engineering problem that require real-time, multi-body coordinated control.

Title: Cell-Free Massive MIMO with Hardware-Impaired Wireless Fronthaul
Authors: Özlem Tuğfe Demir, Emil Björnson
Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) enhances spectral and energy efficiency compared to conventional cellular networks by enabling joint transmission and reception across a large number of distributed access points (APs). Since these APs are envisioned to be low-cost and densely deployed, hardware impairments, stemming from non-ideal radio-frequency (RF) chains, are unavoidable. While existing studies primarily address hardware impairments on the access side, the impact of hardware impairments on the wireless fronthaul link has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we fill this important gap by introducing a novel amplify-and-forward (AF) based wireless fronthauling scheme tailored for cell-free massive MIMO. Focusing on the uplink, we develop an analytical framework that jointly models the hardware impairments at both the APs and the fronthaul transceivers, derives the resulting end-to-end distorted signal expression, and quantifies the individual contribution of each impairment to the spectral efficiency. Furthermore, we design distortion-aware linear combiners that optimally mitigate these effects. Numerical results demonstrate significant performance gains from distortion-aware processing and illustrate the potential of the proposed AF fronthauling scheme as a cost-effective enabler for future cell-free architectures.

Title: Convergence Analysis of Weighted Median Opinion Dynamics with Higher-Order Effects
Authors: Lingrui Chen, Xu Zhang, Fanpeng Song, Fang Wang, Cunquan Qu, Zhixin Liu
Abstract: The weighted median mechanism provides a robust alternative to weighted averaging in opinion dynamics. Existing models, however, are predominantly formulated on pairwise interaction graphs, which limits their ability to represent higher-order environmental effects. In this work, a generalized weighted median opinion dynamics model is proposed by incorporating high-order interactions through a simplicial complex representation. The resulting dynamics are formulated as a nonlinear discrete-time system with synchronous opinion updates, in which intrinsic agent interactions and external environmental influences are jointly modeled. Sufficient conditions for asymptotic consensus are established for heterogeneous systems composed of opinionated and unopinionated agents. For homogeneous opinionated systems, convergence and convergence rates are rigorously analyzed using the Banach fixed-point theorem. Theoretical results demonstrate the stability of the proposed dynamics under mild conditions, and numerical simulations are provided to corroborate the analysis. This work extends median-based opinion dynamics to high-order interaction settings and provides a system-level framework for stability and consensus analysis.

Title: Self-Organizing Dual-Buffer Adaptive Clustering Experience Replay (SODASER) for Safe Reinforcement Learning in Optimal Control
Authors: Roya Khalili Amirabadi, Mohsen Jalaeian Farimani, Omid Solaymani Fard
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning framework, named Self-Organizing Dual-buffer Adaptive Clustering Experience Replay (SODACER), designed to achieve safe and scalable optimal control of nonlinear systems. The proposed SODACER mechanism consisting of a Fast-Buffer for rapid adaptation to recent experiences and a Slow-Buffer equipped with a self-organizing adaptive clustering mechanism to maintain diverse and non-redundant historical experiences. The adaptive clustering mechanism dynamically prunes redundant samples, optimizing memory efficiency while retaining critical environmental patterns. The approach integrates SODASER with Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to guarantee safety by enforcing state and input constraints throughout the learning process. To enhance convergence and stability, the framework is combined with the Sophia optimizer, enabling adaptive second-order gradient updates. The proposed SODACER-Sophia's architecture ensures reliable, effective, and robust learning in dynamic, safety-critical environments, offering a generalizable solution for applications in robotics, healthcare, and large-scale system optimization. The proposed approach is validated on a nonlinear Human Papillomavirus (HPV) transmission model with multiple control inputs and safety constraints. Comparative evaluations against random and clustering-based experience replay methods demonstrate that SODACER achieves faster convergence, improved sample efficiency, and a superior bias-variance trade-off, while maintaining safe system trajectories, validated via the Friedman test.

Title: Modeling Descriptive Norms in Multi-Agent Systems: An Auto-Aggregation PDE Framework with Adaptive Perception Kernels
Authors: Chao Li, Ilia Derevitskii, Sergey Kovalchuk
Abstract: This paper presents a PDE-based auto-aggregation model for simulating descriptive norm dynamics in autonomous multi-agent systems, capturing convergence and violation through non-local perception kernels and external potential fields. Extending classical transport equations, the framework represents opinion popularity as a continuous distribution, enabling direct interactions without Bayesian guessing of beliefs. Applied to a real-world COVID-19 dataset from a major medical center, the experimental results demonstrate that: when clinical guidelines serve as a top-down constraint mechanism, it effectively generates convergence of novel descriptive norms consistent with the dataset; in the bottom-up experiment, potential field guidance successfully promotes the system's reconstruction of descriptive norms aligned with the dataset through violation-and-recoupling; whereas fully autonomous interaction leads to the emergence of multi-centric normative structures independent of the dataset.

Title: Lightweight Resolution-Aware Audio Deepfake Detection via Cross-Scale Attention and Consistency Learning
Authors: K.A.Shahriar
Abstract: Audio deepfake detection has become increasingly challenging due to rapid advances in speech synthesis and voice conversion technologies, particularly under channel distortions, replay attacks, and real-world recording conditions. This paper proposes a resolution-aware audio deepfake detection framework that explicitly models and aligns multi-resolution spectral representations through cross-scale attention and consistency learning. Unlike conventional single-resolution or implicit feature-fusion approaches, the proposed method enforces agreement across complementary time--frequency scales. The proposed framework is evaluated on three representative benchmarks: ASVspoof 2019 (LA and PA), the Fake-or-Real (FoR) dataset, and the In-the-Wild Audio Deepfake dataset under a speaker-disjoint protocol. The method achieves near-perfect performance on ASVspoof LA (EER 0.16%), strong robustness on ASVspoof PA (EER 5.09%), FoR rerecorded audio (EER 4.54%), and in-the-wild deepfakes (AUC 0.98, EER 4.81%), significantly outperforming single-resolution and non-attention baselines under challenging conditions. The proposed model remains lightweight and efficient, requiring only 159k parameters and less than 1~GFLOP per inference, making it suitable for practical deployment. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of cross-scale attention and consistency learning, while gradient-based interpretability analysis reveals that the model learns resolution-consistent and semantically meaningful spectral cues across diverse spoofing conditions. These results demonstrate that explicit cross-resolution modeling provides a principled, robust, and scalable foundation for next-generation audio deepfake detection systems.

Title: Robustness Quantification of MIMO-PI Controller From the Perspective of \(γ\)-Dissipativity
Authors: Zimao Sheng
Abstract: The proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller and its variants are widely used in control engineering, but they often rely on linearization around equilibrium points and empirical parameter tuning, making them ineffective for multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) systems with strong coupling, intense external disturbances, and high nonlinearity. Moreover, existing methods rarely explore the intrinsic stabilization mechanism of PID controllers for disturbed nonlinear systems from the perspective of modern robust control theories such as dissipativity and $\mathcal{L}_2$-gain. To address this gap, this study focuses on $\gamma$-dissipativity (partially equivalent to $\mathcal{L}_2$-gain) and investigates the optimal parameter tuning of MIMO-PI controllers for general disturbed nonlinear MIMO systems. First, by integrating dissipativity theory with the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) inequality, sufficient conditions for the MIMO-PI-controlled system to achieve $\gamma$-dissipativity are established, and the degree of $\gamma$-dissipativity in a local region containing the origin is quantified. Second, an optimal parameter tuning strategy is proposed, which reformulates the $\gamma$-dissipativity optimization problem into a class of standard eigenvalue problems (EVPs) and further converts it into linear matrix inequality (LMI) formulations for efficient online computation. Comprehensive simulation experiments validate the effectiveness and optimality of the proposed approach. This work provides a theoretical basis for the robust stabilization of general disturbed nonlinear MIMO systems and enriches the parameter tuning methods of PID controllers from the perspective of dissipativity.

Title: Stereo Audio Rendering for Personal Sound Zones Using a Binaural Spatially Adaptive Neural Network (BSANN)
Authors: Hao Jiang, Edgar Choueiri
Abstract: A binaural rendering framework for personal sound zones (PSZs) is proposed to enable multiple head-tracked listeners to receive fully independent stereo audio programs. Current PSZ systems typically rely on monophonic rendering and therefore cannot control the left and right ears separately, which limits the quality and accuracy of spatial imaging. The proposed method employs a Binaural Spatially Adaptive Neural Network (BSANN) to generate ear-optimized loudspeaker filters that reconstruct the desired acoustic field at each ear of multiple listeners. The framework integrates anechoically measured loudspeaker frequency responses, analytically modeled transducer directivity, and rigid-sphere head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) to enhance acoustic accuracy and spatial rendering fidelity. An explicit active crosstalk cancellation (XTC) stage further improves three-dimensional spatial perception. Experiments show significant gains in measured objective performance metrics, including inter-zone isolation (IZI), inter-program isolation (IPI), and crosstalk cancellation (XTC), with log-frequency-weighted values of 10.23/10.03 dB (IZI), 11.11/9.16 dB (IPI), and 10.55/11.13 dB (XTC), respectively, over 100-20,000 Hz. The combined use of ear-wise control, accurate acoustic modeling, and integrated active XTC produces a unified rendering method that delivers greater isolation performance, increased robustness to room asymmetry, and more faithful spatial reproduction in real acoustic environments.

Title: A Multimodal Deep Learning Framework for Predicting ICU Deterioration: Integrating ECG Waveforms with Clinical Data and Clinician Benchmarking
Authors: Juan Miguel López Alcaraz, Xicoténcatl López Moran, Erick Dávila Zaragoza, Claas Händel, Richard Koebe, Wilhelm Haverkamp, Nils Strodthoff
Abstract: Artificial intelligence holds strong potential to support clinical decision making in intensive care units where timely and accurate risk assessment is critical. However, many existing models focus on isolated outcomes or limited data types, while clinicians integrate longitudinal history, real time physiology, and heterogeneous clinical information. To address this gap, we developed MDS ICU, a unified multimodal machine learning framework that fuses routinely collected data including demographics, biometrics, vital signs, laboratory values, ECG waveforms, surgical procedures, and medical device usage to provide continuous predictive support during ICU stays. Using 63001 samples from 27062 patients in MIMIC IV, we trained a deep learning architecture that combines structured state space S4 encoders for ECG waveforms with multilayer perceptron RealMLP encoders for tabular data to jointly predict 33 clinically relevant outcomes spanning mortality, organ dysfunction, medication needs, and acute deterioration. The model achieved strong discrimination with AUROCs of 0.90 for 24 hour mortality, 0.92 for sedative administration, 0.97 for invasive mechanical ventilation, and 0.93 for coagulation dysfunction. Calibration analysis showed close agreement between predicted and observed risks, with consistent gains from ECG waveform integration. Comparisons with clinicians and large language models showed that model predictions alone outperformed both, and that providing model outputs as decision support further improved their performance. These results demonstrate that multimodal AI can deliver clinically meaningful risk stratification across diverse ICU outcomes while augmenting rather than replacing clinical expertise, establishing a scalable foundation for precision critical care decision support.

Abstract: This work introduces a robust single-channel inverse filter for dereverberation of non-ideal recordings, validated on real audio. The developed method focuses on the calculation and modification of a discrete impulse response in order to filter the characteristics from a known digital single channel recording setup and room characteristics such as early reflections and reverberations. The aim is a dryer and clearer signal reconstruction, which ideally would be the direct-path signal. The time domain impulse response is calculated from the cepstral domain and faded by means of frequency bin specific exponential decay in the spectrum. The decay rates are obtained by using the blind estimates of reverberation time ratio between recorded output and test signals for each frequency bin. The modified impulse response does filter a recorded audio-signal by deconvolution. The blind estimation is well known and stands out for its robustness to noise and non-idealities. Estimation of a direct path signal is key to many applications.

Title: A Power Electronic Converter Control Framework Based on Graph Neural Networks - An Early Proof-of-Concept
Authors: Darius Jakobeit, Oliver Wallscheid
Abstract: Power electronic converter control is typically tuned per topology, limiting transfer across heterogeneous designs. This letter proposes a topology-agnostic meta-control framework that encodes converter netlists as typed bipartite graphs and uses a task-conditioned graph neural network backbone with distributed control heads. The policy is trained end-to-end via differentiable predictive control to amortize constrained optimal control over a distribution of converter parameters and reference-tracking tasks. In simulation on randomly sampled buck converters, the learned controller achieves near-optimal tracking performance relative to an online optimal-control baseline, motivating future extension to broader topologies, objectives, and real-time deployment.

Title: USFetal: Tools for Fetal Brain Ultrasound Compounding
Authors: Mohammad Khateri, Morteza Ghahremani, Sergio Valencia, Camilo Jaimes, Alejandra Sierra, Jussi Tohka, P. Ellen Grant, Davood Karimi
Abstract: Ultrasound offers a safe, cost-effective, and widely accessible technology for fetal brain imaging, making it especially suitable for routine clinical use. However, it suffers from view-dependent artifacts, operator variability, and a limited field of view, which make interpretation and quantitative evaluation challenging. Ultrasound compounding aims to overcome these limitations by integrating complementary information from multiple 3D acquisitions into a single, coherent volumetric representation. This work provides four main contributions: (1) We present the first systematic categorization of computational strategies for fetal brain ultrasound compounding, including both classical techniques and modern learning-based frameworks. (2) We implement and compare representative methods across four key categories - multi-scale, transformation-based, variational, and deep learning approaches - emphasizing their core principles and practical advantages. (3) Motivated by the lack of full-view, artifact-free ground truth required for supervised learning, we focus on unsupervised and self-supervised strategies and introduce two new deep learning based approaches: a self-supervised compounding framework and an adaptation of unsupervised deep plug-and-play priors for compounding. (4) We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on ten multi-view fetal brain ultrasound datasets, using both expert radiologist scoring and standard quantitative image-quality metrics. We also release the USFetal Compounding Toolbox, publicly available to support benchmarking and future research. Keywords: Ultrasound compounding, fetal brain, deep learning, self-supervised, unsupervised.

Authors: Kun-Chih (Jimmy)Chen, Chia-Hsin Chen, Lei-Qi Wang, Chun-Chieh Wang
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of thermal sensor allocation and full-chip temperature reconstruction in multi-core systems by leveraging an entropy-based sensor placement strategy and an adaptive compressive sensing approach. By selecting sensor locations that capture diverse thermal behaviors and dynamically adjusting the measurement matrix, our method significantly enhances the accuracy of the full-chip temperature reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach reduces full-chip temperature reconstruction error by 18% to 95%. In addition to the full-chip temperature reconstruction efficiency enhancement, our proposed method improves hardware efficiency by 5% to 514% over the related works. These findings highlight the potential of our method for more effective dynamic temperature management in future high-performance multi-core systems.

Title: Control and Stability of a Multilevel Power System for a Future Distribution Network
Authors: Xian Wu, Jan H. van Schuppen, Hai Xiang Lin
Abstract: The growing integration of renewable energy sources into distribution networks poses significant challenges to frequency and voltage stability due to their intermittent nature and low-inertia dynamics. This paper proposes a multilevel control framework for a future decarbonized power system, using energy storage systems as power buffers to mitigate frequency and voltage fluctuations. A nonlinear interconnected model is formulated to characterize the complex dynamics across multiple levels of the distribution network. To reduce operational complexity and communication overhead of these dynamics, a distributed linear quadratic regulator control strategy is developed for information exchange in a bottom-up approach, where each level implements local feedback control within a short time horizon. Stability conditions for both open-loop and closed-loop systems are established using Lyapunov-based analysis. In addition, explicit performance bounds are derived to quantify the optimal difference between the proposed distributed strategy and the centralized control method, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Authors: Yasir Ali, Tayyab Manzoor, Huan Yang, Chenhang Yan, Yuanqing Xia
Abstract: The ongoing evolution of 5G and its enhanced version, 5G+, has significantly transformed the telecommunications landscape, driving an unprecedented demand for ultra-high-speed data transmission, ultra-low latency, and resilient connectivity. These capabilities are essential for enabling mission-critical applications such as the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, and smart city infrastructures. This paper investigates the important role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in addressing the key challenges faced by 5G/5G+ networks, including interference mitigation, dynamic resource allocation, and maintaining seamless network operation. The study particularly focuses on AI-driven innovations in coding theory, which offer advanced solutions to the limitations of conventional error correction and modulation techniques. By employing deep learning, reinforcement learning, and neural network-based approaches, this research demonstrates significant advancements in error correction performance, decoding efficiency, and adaptive transmission strategies. Additionally, the integration of AI with emerging technologies, such as massive multiple-input and multiple-output, intelligent reflecting surfaces, and privacy-enhancing mechanisms, is discussed, highlighting their potential to propel the next generation of wireless networks. This paper also provides insights into the transformative impact of AI on modern wireless communication, establishing a foundation for scalable, adaptive, and more efficient network architectures.

Title: RIS-aided ISAC with $K$-Rydberg Atomic Receivers
Authors: Hong-Bae Jeon, Chan-Byoung Chae
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) framework equipped with multiple Rydberg atomic receiver (RAR)-aided users. By leveraging the reference-assisted reception mechanism of RARs, we develop a unified signal model that jointly captures downlink multi-user communication with RARs and monostatic radar sensing. To explicitly balance communication performance and sensing accuracy, we formulate a Cramer-Rao bound (CRB)-constrained utility maximization problem. To address these challenges, we propose a joint optimization framework that combines fractional programming (FP), majorization-minimization (MM), and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms the conventional approach over a wide range of system environments, thereby highlighting the importance of the proposed framework in unlocking the potential of RARs for 6G.

Title: Radar-Based Identification of Individuals Using Heartbeat Features Extracted from Signal Amplitude and Phase
Authors: Haruto Kobayashi, Takuya Sakamoto
Abstract: This study proposes a non-contact method for identifying individuals through the use of heartbeat features measured with millimeter-wave radar. Although complex-valued radar signal spectrograms are commonly used for this task, little attention has been paid to the choice of signal components, namely, whether to use amplitude, phase, or the complex signal itself. Although spectrograms can be constructed independently from amplitude or phase information, their respective contributions to identification accuracy remain unclear. To address this issue, we first evaluate identification performance using spectrograms derived separately from amplitude, phase, and complex signals. We then propose a feature fusion method that integrates these three representations to enhance identification accuracy. Experiments conducted with a 79-GHz radar system and involving six participants achieved an identification accuracy of 97.67%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed component-wise analysis and integration approach.

Title: Movable Beyond-Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: Moving, Interconnecting, or Both?
Authors: Shuyue Xu, Matteo Nerini, Bruno Clerckx
Abstract: This letter proposes a movable beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (MA-BD-RIS) design, combining inter-element connectivity and movability for channel enhancement. We study a MA-BD-RIS assisted multi-user multiple input single output system where beamforming, BD-RIS configuration, and elements positions are jointly optimized to maximize the sum-rate. An efficient algorithm is developed, incorporating closed-form beamforming, a low-complexity partially proximal alternating direction method of multipliers for BD-RIS design, and successive convex approximation for element placement. Simulations show that the high-movability structure yields superior performance in small-scale RIS and rich scattering scenarios, while the high-connectivity structure dominates in large-scale RIS and massive transmit array configurations.

Title: Deep Learning Based Channel Extrapolation for Dual-Band Massive MIMO Systems
Authors: Qikai Xiao, Kehui Li, Binggui Zhou, Shaodan Ma
Abstract: Future wireless communication systems will increasingly rely on the integration of millimeter wave (mmWave) and sub-6 GHz bands to meet heterogeneous demands on high-speed data transmission and extensive coverage. To fully exploit the benefits of mmWave bands in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, highly accurate channel state information (CSI) is required. However, directly estimating the mmWave channel demands substantial pilot overhead due to the large CSI dimension and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) led by severe path loss and blockage attenuation. In this paper, we propose an efficient \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{D}omain \textbf{F}usion \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{E}xtrapolator (MDFCE) to extrapolate sub-6 GHz band CSI to mmWave band CSI, so as to reduce the pilot overhead for mmWave CSI acquisition in dual band massive MIMO systems. Unlike traditional channel extrapolation methods based on mathematical modeling, the proposed MDFCE combines the mixture-of-experts framework and the multi-head self-attention mechanism to fuse multi-domain features of sub-6 GHz CSI, aiming to characterize the mapping from sub-6 GHz CSI to mmWave CSI effectively and efficiently. The simulation results demonstrate that MDFCE can achieve superior performance with less training pilots compared with existing methods across various antenna array scales and signal-to-noise ratio levels while showing a much higher computational efficiency.

Title: Fast frequency response with heterogeneous communication delay management under the SCION Internet architecture
Authors: Jialun Zhang, Felix Kottmann, Jimmy Chih-Hsien Peng, Adrian Perrig, Gabriela Hug
Abstract: System operators can increasingly exploit distributed energy resources (DERs) and controllable loads (CLs) to provide frequency response services. In conventional practice, communication between the system operator and flexible devices relies on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)-based Internet. However, existing BGP-based architectures face challenges in providing latency-guaranteed control, while direct private and proprietary communication networks lead to additional deployment and maintenance costs. In contrast, the SCION-based Internet architecture supports latency-minimum path selection, which makes it suitable for latency-sensitive frequency contingency services such as fast frequency response (FFR). Hence, this paper proposes a real-time reserve dispatch framework to optimally select a portfolio of flexible devices to deliver FFR services using the SCION-based Internet. First, an analytical expression of the system frequency dynamics with respect to heterogeneous communication latencies is derived. Next, a cyber-physical co-optimization model is formulated to jointly schedule communication paths and physical flexibility resources for real-time FFR provision. To improve the computation efficiency, we propose a heuristic FFR allocation algorithm to approximate the optimal response portfolio, integrating contributions from both DERs and CLs. Numerical case studies demonstrate the benefits of the proposed algorithm and its capability to approximate the optimality of the reserves allocation while significantly reducing the computation time.

Title: TagSpeech: End-to-End Multi-Speaker ASR and Diarization with Fine-Grained Temporal Grounding
Authors: Mingyue Huo, Yiwen Shao, Yuheng Zhang
Abstract: We present TagSpeech, a unified LLM-based framework that utilizes Temporal Anchor Grounding for joint multi-speaker ASR and diarization. The framework is built on two key designs: (1) decoupled semantic and speaker streams fine-tuned via Serialized Output Training (SOT) to learn turn-taking dynamics; and (2) an interleaved time anchor mechanism that not only supports fine-grained timestamp prediction but also acts as a synchronization signal between semantic understanding and speaker tracking. Compared to previous works that primarily focus on speaker-attributed ASR or implicit diarization, TagSpeech addresses the challenge of fine-grained speaker-content alignment and explicitly models "who spoke what and when" in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on AMI and AliMeeting benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in Diarization Error Rate (DER) over strong end-to-end baselines, including Qwen-Omni and Gemini, particularly in handling complex speech overlaps. Moreover, TagSpeech employs a parameter-efficient training paradigm in which the LLM backbone is frozen and only lightweight projectors are trained, resulting in strong performance with low computational cost.

Title: Hardware-in-the-loop wind-tunnel testing of wake interactions between two floating wind turbines
Authors: Alessandro Fontanella, Kristjan Milic, Alan Facchinetti, Sara Muggiasca, Marco Belloli
Abstract: Wake interactions in floating wind farms are inherently coupled to platform motion, yet most experimental studies to date neglect this two-way coupling by prescribing platform movements. This work presents a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) wind-tunnel methodology to investigate wake interactions between two floating wind turbines with fully coupled aerodynamic loading and platform dynamics. The approach integrates physical wind-tunnel testing of two scaled rotors with a real-time numerical model that accounts for platform motion, mooring restoring forces, and hydrodynamic loads. Experiments conducted under low-turbulence inflow conditions show that a downstream turbine operating in the wake of an upstream turbine experiences reduced mean thrust and platform deflections due to the decreased inflow velocity, alongside enhanced low-frequency platform motions driven by increased turbulent energy in the wake. The proposed HIL framework provides a controlled experimental basis for studying wake-induced excitation mechanisms and supports the validation of floating wind farm models and control strategies.

Title: Continuous Energy Landscape Model for Analyzing Brain State Transitions
Authors: Triet M. Tran, Seyed Majid Razavi, Dee H. Wu, Sina Khanmohammadi
Abstract: Energy landscape models characterize neural dynamics by assigning energy values to each brain state that reflect their stability or probability of occurrence. The conventional energy landscape models rely on binary brain state representation, where each region is considered either active or inactive based on some signal threshold. However, this binarization leads to significant information loss and an exponential increase in the number of possible brain states, making the calculation of energy values infeasible for large numbers of brain regions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel continuous energy landscape framework that employs Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn a continuous precision matrix directly from functional MRI (fMRI) signals, preserving the full range of signal values during energy landscape computation. We validated our approach using both synthetic data and real-world fMRI datasets from brain tumor patients. Our results on synthetic data generated from a switching linear dynamical system (SLDS) and a Kuramoto model show that the continuous energy model achieved higher likelihood and more accurate recovery of basin geometry, state occupancy, and transition dynamics than conventional binary energy landscape models. In addition, results from the fMRI dataset indicate a 0.27 increase in AUC for predicting working memory and executive function, along with a 0.35 improvement in explained variance (R2) for predicting reaction time. These findings highlight the advantages of utilizing the full signal values in energy landscape models for capturing neuronal dynamics, with strong implications for diagnosing and monitoring neurological disorders.

Title: DIVINE: Coordinating Multimodal Disentangled Representations for Oro-Facial Neurological Disorder Assessment
Authors: Mohd Mujtaba Akhtar, Girish, Muskaan Singh
Abstract: In this study, we present a multimodal framework for predicting neuro-facial disorders by capturing both vocal and facial cues. We hypothesize that explicitly disentangling shared and modality-specific representations within multimodal foundation model embeddings can enhance clinical interpretability and generalization. To validate this hypothesis, we propose DIVINE a fully disentangled multimodal framework that operates on representations extracted from state-of-the-art (SOTA) audio and video foundation models, incorporating hierarchical variational bottlenecks, sparse gated fusion, and learnable symptom tokens. DIVINE operates in a multitask learning setup to jointly predict diagnostic categories (Healthy Control,ALS, Stroke) and severity levels (Mild, Moderate, Severe). The model is trained using synchronized audio and video inputs and evaluated on the Toronto NeuroFace dataset under full (audio-video) as well as single-modality (audio- only and video-only) test conditions. Our proposed approach, DIVINE achieves SOTA result, with the DeepSeek-VL2 and TRILLsson combination reaching 98.26% accuracy and 97.51% F1-score. Under modality-constrained scenarios, the framework performs well, showing strong generalization when tested with video-only or audio-only inputs. It consistently yields superior performance compared to unimodal models and baseline fusion techniques. To the best of our knowledge, DIVINE is the first framework that combines cross-modal disentanglement, adaptive fusion, and multitask learning to comprehensively assess neurological disorders using synchronized speech and facial video.

Title: Bridging Attribution and Open-Set Detection using Graph-Augmented Instance Learning in Synthetic Speech
Authors: Mohd Mujtaba Akhtar, Girish, Farhan Sheth, Muskaan Singh
Abstract: We propose a unified framework for not only attributing synthetic speech to its source but also for detecting speech generated by synthesizers that were not encountered during training. This requires methods that move beyond simple detection to support both detailed forensic analysis and open-set generalization. To address this, we introduce SIGNAL, a hybrid framework that combines speech foundation models (SFMs) with graph-based modeling and open-set-aware inference. Our framework integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and a k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier, allowing it to capture meaningful relationships between utterances and recognize speech that doesn`t belong to any known generator. It constructs a query-conditioned graph over generator class prototypes, enabling the GNN to reason over relationships among candidate generators, while the KNN branch supports open-set detection via confidence-based thresholding. We evaluate SIGNAL using the DiffSSD dataset, which offers a diverse mix of real speech and synthetic audio from both open-source and commercial diffusion-based TTS systems. To further assess generalization, we also test on the SingFake benchmark. Our results show that SIGNAL consistently improves performance across both tasks, with Mamba-based embeddings delivering especially strong results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to unify graph-based learning and open-set detection for tracing synthetic speech back to its origin.

Title: Next-Generation Grid Codes: Toward a New Paradigm for Dynamic Ancillary Services
Authors: Verena Häberle, Kehao Zhuang, Xiuqiang He, Linbin Huang, Florian Dörfler
Abstract: This paper presents preliminary results toward a conceptual foundation for Next Generation Grid Codes (NGGCs) based on decentralized stability and performance certification for dynamic ancillary services. The proposed NGGC framework targets two core outcomes: (i) guaranteed closed-loop stability and (ii) explicit performance assurances for power-system frequency and voltage dynamics. Stability is addressed using loop-shifting and passivity-based methods that yield local frequency-domain certificates for individual devices, enabling fully decentralized verification of the interconnected system. Performance is characterized by deriving quantitative bounds on key time-domain metrics (e.g., nadirs, rate-of-change-of-frequency (RoCoF), steady-state deviations, and oscillation damping) through frequency-domain constraints on local device behavior. The framework is non-parametric and model-agnostic, accommodating a broad class of device dynamics under mild assumptions, and provides an initial unified approach to stability and performance certification without explicit device-model parameterization. As such, these results offer a principled starting point for the development of future grid codes and control design methodologies in modern power systems.

Title: Autofocus Method for Human-Body Imaging under Respiratory Motion Using Synthetic Aperture Radar
Authors: Masaya Kato, Takuya Sakamoto
Abstract: This study presents an effective autofocusing approach for synthetic aperture radar imaging of the human body under conditions of respiratory motion. The proposed method suppresses respiratory-motion-induced phase errors by separating radar echoes in the spatial- and time-frequency domains and estimating phase errors individually for each separated echo. By compensating for the estimated phase errors, synthetic aperture radar images focused on all scattering points are generated, even when multiple body parts exhibit different motions due to respiration. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through experiments with four participants in the supine position. Compared with a conventional method, the proposed approach improves image quality by a factor of 5.1 in terms of Muller-Buffington sharpness, and reduces the root-mean-square error with respect to a reference point cloud from 34 mm to 20 mm.

Title: Digital Twin for Ultra-Reliable & Low-Latency 6G Wireless Communications in Dense Urban City
Authors: Abdikarim Mohamed Ibrahim, Rosdiadee Nordin
Abstract: High-frequency deployments in dense cities are difficult to plan because coverage, interference, and service reliability depend sensitively on local morphology. This paper develops a geometric Digital Twin (DT) of the Sunway City and uses it to study the service implications of a multi-site mmWave deployment. The DT is constructed from geo-referenced three-dimensional meshes of buildings, roads, and open areas, assembled in Blender and exported as a mesh scene. A seven-transmitter downlink at 10 GHz is then embedded into this geometry and evaluated using a GPU accelerated ray tracing engine that returns path-gain and Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) fields over a dense grid of user locations. These fields are mapped to achievable throughput and compared against representative target rates for immersive extended reality (XR), vehicle-to-everything (V2X) services, and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). The resulting maps show that favourable streets and courtyards form narrow high rate corridors surrounded by deep shadows, even within a dense area. In the baseline deployment, one fifth of the simulated area can maintain 100 Mbps URLLC rates, and less than 10% of cells can reach 1.7 Gbps for XR, despite the presence of several rooftop sites. By exploiting the DT, we further quantify the macro-diversity margin between the best and second best serving sites and show that most URLLC-feasible cells have several decibels of SINR headroom that could be harvested through dual connectivity. The study shows how a city DT can translate ray tracing output into service centric metrics and planning insights, complementing both analytical models and expensive measurement campaigns.

Title: Geometry-Aware LoRaWAN Gateway Placement in Dense Urban Cities Using Digital Twins
Authors: Abdikarim Mohamed Ibrahim, Rosdiadee Nordin
Abstract: LoRaWAN deployments rely on rough range estimates or simplified propagation models to decide where to place/mount gateways. As a result, operators have limited visibility into how rooftop choice, streets, and building shadowing jointly affect coverage and reliability. This paper addresses the problem of gateway placement in dense urban environments by combining a geometry accurate Digital Twin (DT) with a GPU accelerated ray tracing engine. Existing studies optimize placement on abstract grids or tune models with sparse measurements; few works evaluate LoRaWAN gateways on a full 3D city model using a realistic link budget. In this paper, we develop a DT with ITU radio materials and evaluate eight candidate rooftops for RAK7289 WisGate Edge Pro gateways under a sub-GHz link budget derived from the data sheet. For each rooftop, we obtain Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR) on a 5 meter grid, derive robust and edge coverage indicators, and apply a greedy maximum coverage algorithm to rank sites and quantify the benefit of incremental densification. Results show that a single rooftop gateway covers one fifth of the full Sunway twin (i.e., the DT) at a robust SNR threshold, and that six sites still leave large areas of single gateway or out of coverage cells in surrounding residential streets. The findings from this paper shows that DT and ray tracing tools enable network operators to bridge the gap of expensive real-world trials and planning to identify if the planned LoRaWAN gateway is sufficient or additional sites are required.

Title: Fault detection of nonlinear industrial processes based on control theory-informed machine learning methods
Authors: Linlin Li, Steven X. Ding, Maiying Zhong, Dong Zhao, Yang Shi
Abstract: This paper deals with analysis, simultaneous detection of faults and attacks, fault-tolerant control and attack-resilient of cyber-physical control systems. In our recent work, it has been observed that an attack detector driven by an input residual signal is capable of reliably detecting attacks. In particular, observing system dynamics from the perspective of the system input-output signal space reveals that attacks and system uncertainties act on different system subspaces. These results motivate our exploration of secure and safe cyber-physical control systems in the unified framework of control and detection. The unified framework is proposed to handle control and detection issues uniformly and in subspaces of system input-output data. Its mathematical and control-theoretic basis is system coprime factorizations with Bezout identity at its core. We firstly explore those methods and schemes of the unified framework, which serve as the major control-theoretic tool in our work. It is followed by re-visiting and examining established attack detection and resilient control schemes. The major part of our work is the endeavours to develop a control-theoretic paradigm, in which analysis, simultaneous detection of faults and attacks, fault-tolerant and attack-resilient control of cyber-physical control systems are addressed in a unified manner.

Title: Nonlinear Observer Design for Visual-Inertial Odometry
Authors: Mouaad Boughellaba, Abdelhamid Tayebi, James R. Forbes, Soulaimane Berkane
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) for rigid body systems evolving in three-dimensional space. We introduce a novel matrix Lie group structure, denoted SE_{3+n}(3), that unifies the pose, gravity, linear velocity, and landmark positions within a consistent geometric framework tailored to the VIO problem. Building upon this formulation, we design an almost globally asymptotically stable nonlinear geometric observer that tightly integrates data from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and visual sensors. Unlike conventional Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)-based estimators that rely on local linearization and thus ensure only local convergence, the proposed observer achieves almost global stability through the decoupling of the rotational and translational dynamics. A globally exponentially stable Riccati-based translational observer along with an almost global input-to-state stable attitude observer are designed such that the overall cascaded observer enjoys almost global asymptotic stability. This cascaded architecture guarantees robust and consistent estimation of the extended state, including orientation, position, velocity, gravity, and landmark positions, up to the VIO unobservable directions (i.e., a global translation and rotation about gravity). The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through numerical simulations as well as experimental validation on the EuRoC MAV dataset, highlighting its robustness and suitability for real-world VIO applications.

Title: LaminoDiff: Artifact-Free Computed Laminography in Non-Destructive Testing via Diffusion Model
Authors: Tan Liu, Liu Shi, Binghuang Peng, Tong Jia, Xiaoling Xu, Baodong Liu, Qiegen Liu
Abstract: Computed Laminography (CL) is a key non-destructive testing technology for the visualization of internal structures in large planar objects. The inherent scanning geometry of CL inevitably results in inter-layer aliasing artifacts, limiting its practical application, particularly in electronic component inspection. While deep learning (DL) provides a powerful paradigm for artifact removal, its effectiveness is often limited by the domain gap between synthetic data and real-world data. In this work, we present LaminoDiff, a framework to integrate a diffusion model with a high-fidelity prior representation to bridge the domain gap in CL imaging. This prior, generated via a dual-modal CT-CL fusion strategy, is integrated into the proposed network as a conditional constraint. This integration ensures high-precision preservation of circuit structures and geometric fidelity while suppressing artifacts. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real PCB datasets demonstrate that LaminoDiff achieves high-fidelity reconstruction with competitive performance in artifact suppression and detail recovery. More importantly, the results facilitate reliable automated defect recognition.

Title: Stochastic Power-Water Coordination: Unlocking Flexibility in Hybrid RO Desalination Plants via Variable-Speed Pumps and Tank Mixing
Authors: Rongxing Hu, Charalambos Konstantinou
Abstract: Water desalination plants (DPs) are among the most critical infrastructures and largest electricity loads in water-scarce regions worldwide. Although reverse osmosis (RO) desalination is the most energy-efficient and dominant technology, it remains energy-intensive but can offer substantial flexibility potential for power systems. This paper proposes a coordinated operation framework for power systems and DPs that explicitly accounts for both systems' operational constraints and fully unlocks DP flexibility. To achieve this, a detailed DP model is developed, incorporating the characteristics of an actual high-pressure pump with variable-speed operation, on-off operation with flushing requirements, water quality constraints, and water dynamics and salt mixing in the storage tank. By proactively managing freshwater storage and tank salinity in a closed-loop coordinated scheduling framework, the operational flexibility of the DP is significantly enhanced. With appropriate simplification and linearization, the resulting coordinated scheduling problem is formulated as a tractable mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, and a two-step decomposed commitment-scheduling stochastic optimization (TDCSO) is proposed to efficiently address uncertainties. Case studies validate the proposed approach and demonstrate up to a 6% operating cost reduction.

Title: Antenna Coding Optimization for Pixel Antenna Empowered MIMO Wireless Power Transfer
Authors: Yijun Chen, Shanpu Shen, Tianrui Qiao, Hongyu Li, Kai-Kit Wong, Ross Murch
Abstract: We investigate antenna coding utilizing pixel antennas as a new degree of freedom for enhancing multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless power transfer (WPT) systems. The objective is to enhance the output direct current (DC) power under RF combining and DC combining schemes by jointly exploiting gains from antenna coding, beamforming, and rectenna nonlinearity. We first propose the MIMO WPT system model with binary and continuous antenna coding using the beamspace channel model and formulate the joint antenna coding and beamforming optimization using a nonlinear rectenna model. We propose two efficient closed-form successive convex approximation algorithms to efficiently optimize the beamforming. To further reduce the computational complexity, we propose codebook-based antenna coding designs for output DC power maximization based on K-means clustering. Results show that the proposed pixel antenna empowered MIMO WPT system with binary antenna coding increases output DC power by more than 15 dB compared with conventional systems with fixed antenna configuration. With continuous antenna coding, the performance improves another 6 dB. Moreover, the proposed codebook design outperforms previous designs by up to 40% and shows good performance with reduced computational complexity. Overall, the significant improvement in output DC power verifies the potential of leveraging antenna coding utilizing pixel antennas to enhance WPT systems.

Title: Efficient Convolutional Forward Model for Passive Acoustic Mapping and Temporal Monitoring
Authors: Tatiana Gelvez-Barrera, Barbara Nicolas, Bruno Gilles, Adrian Basarab, Denis Kouamé
Abstract: Passive acoustic mapping (PAM) is a key imaging technique for characterizing cavitation activity in therapeutic ultrasound applications. Recent model-based beamforming algorithms offer high reconstruction quality and strong physical interpretability. However, their computational burden and limited temporal resolution restrict their use in applications with time-evolving cavitation. To address these challenges, we introduce a PAM beamforming framework based on a novel convolutional formulation in the time domain, which enables efficient computation. In this framework, PAM is formulated as an inverse problem in which the forward operator maps spatiotemporal cavitation activity to recorded radio-frequency signals accounting for time-of-flight delays defined by the acquisition geometry. We then formulate a regularized inversion algorithm that incorporates prior knowledge on cavitation activity. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms classical beamforming methods, providing higher temporal resolution than frequency-domain techniques while substantially reducing computational burden compared with iterative time-domain formulations.

Title: Directional reflection modeling via wavenumber-domain reflection coefficient for 3D acoustic field simulation
Authors: Satoshi Hoshika, Takahiro Iwami, Akira Omoto
Abstract: This study proposes a framework for incorporating wavenumber-domain acoustic reflection coefficients into sound field analysis to characterize direction-dependent material reflection and scattering phenomena. The reflection coefficient is defined as the amplitude ratio between incident and reflected waves for each propagation direction and is estimated from spatial Fourier transforms of the incident and reflected sound fields. The resulting wavenumber-domain reflection coefficients are converted into an acoustic admittance representation that is directly compatible with numerical methods such as the Boundary Element Method (BEM), enabling simulation of reflections beyond simple specular components. Unlike conventional extended reaction models, the proposed approach avoids explicit modeling of the material interior. This significantly reduces computational cost while allowing direct use of measured data, empirical models, or user-defined directional reflection characteristics. The validity of the proposed formulation was previously demonstrated by the authors through two-dimensional sound field simulations, in which accurate reproduction of direction-dependent reflection behavior was confirmed. In the present work, the framework is extended to three-dimensional analysis, demonstrating its applicability to more realistic and complex acoustic environments. The proposed approach provides a practical and flexible tool for simulating direction-dependent acoustic reflections and scattering, with potential applications in architectural acoustics, material characterization, and noise control.

Title: Fast Multi-Stack Slice-to-Volume Reconstruction via Multi-Scale Unrolled Optimization
Authors: Margherita Firenze, Sean I. Young, Clinton J. Wang, Hyuk Jin Yun, Elfar Adalsteinsson, Kiho Im, P. Ellen Grant, Polina Golland
Abstract: Fully convolutional networks have become the backbone of modern medical imaging due to their ability to learn multi-scale representations and perform end-to-end inference. Yet their potential for slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), the task of jointly estimating 3D anatomy and slice poses from misaligned 2D acquisitions, remains underexplored. We introduce a fast convolutional framework that fuses multiple orthogonal 2D slice stacks to recover coherent 3D structure and refines slice alignment through lightweight model-based optimization. Applied to fetal brain MRI, our approach reconstructs high-quality 3D volumes in under 10s, with 1s slice registration and accuracy on par with state-of-the-art iterative SVR pipelines, offering more than speedup. The framework uses non-rigid displacement fields to represent transformations, generalizing to other SVR problems like fetal body and placental MRI. Additionally, the fast inference time paves the way for real-time, scanner-side volumetric feedback during MRI acquisition.

Title: Energy-efficient torque allocation for straight-line driving of electric vehicles based on pseudoconvex polynomials
Authors: Josip Kir Hromatko, Šandor Ileš, Branimir Škugor, Joško Deur
Abstract: Electric vehicles with multiple motors provide a flexibility in meeting the driver torque demand, which calls for minimizing the battery energy consumption through torque allocation. In this paper, we present an approach to this problem based on approximating electric motor losses using higher-order polynomials with specific properties. To ensure a well-behaved optimization landscape, monotonicity and positivity constraints are imposed on the polynomial models using sum of squares programming. This methodology provides robustness against noisy or sparse data, while retaining the computational efficiency of a polynomial function approximation. The torque allocation problem based on such polynomials is formulated as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem and solved efficiently using readily available solvers. In the nominal case, the first-order necessary conditions for optimality can also be used to obtain a global solution. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on several certification driving cycles against a grid search-based benchmark. Results show a modest influence on electric energy consumption, while enabling real-time optimization and integration with other vehicle control systems.

Title: Vector Quantized-Aided XL-MIMO CSI Feedback with Channel Adaptive Transmission
Authors: Yuhang Ma, Nan Ma, Jianqiao Chen, Wenkai Liu
Abstract: Efficient channel state information (CSI) feedback is critical for 6G extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems to mitigate channel interference. However, the massive antenna scale imposes a severe burden on feedback overhead. Meanwhile, existing quantized feedback methods face dual challenges of limited quantization precision and insufficient channel robustness when compressing high-dimensional channel features into discrete symbols. To reduce these gaps, guided by the deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) framework, we propose a vector quantized (VQ)-aided scheme for CSI feedback in XL-MIMO systems considering the near-field effect, named VQ-DJSCC-F. Firstly, taking advantage of the sparsity of near-field channels in the polar-delay domain, we extract energy-concentrated features to reduce dimensionality. Then, we simultaneously design the Transformer and CNN (convolutional neural network) architectures as the backbones to hierarchically extract CSI features, followed by VQ modules projecting features into a discrete latent space. The entropy loss regularization in synergy with an exponential moving average (EMA) update strategy is introduced to maximize quantization precision. Furthermore, we develop an attention mechanism-driven channel adaptation module to mitigate the impact of wireless channel fading on the transmission of index sequences. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves superior CSI reconstruction accuracy with lower feedback overheads under varying channel conditions.

Title: Recursive Binary Identification with Differential Privacy and Data Tampering Attacks
Authors: Jimin Wang, Jieming Ke, Jin Guo, Yanlong Zhao
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the parameter estimation in a bandwidth-constrained sensor network communicating through an insecure medium. The sensor performs a local quantization, and transmits a 1-bit message to an estimation center through a wireless medium where the transmission of information is vulnerable to attackers. Both eavesdroppers and data tampering attackers are considered in our setting. A differential privacy method is used to protect the sensitive information against eavesdroppers. Then, a recursive projection algorithm is proposed such that the estimation center achieves the almost sure convergence and mean-square convergence when quantized measurements, differential privacy, and data tampering attacks are considered in a uniform framework. A privacy analysis including the convergence rate with privacy or without privacy is given. Further, we extend the problem to multi-agent systems. For this case, a distributed recursive projection algorithm is proposed with guaranteed almost sure and mean square convergence. A simulation example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

Title: Learning to Unfold Fractional Programming for Multi-Cell MU-MIMO Beamforming with Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Zihan Jiao, Xinping Yi, Shi Jin
Abstract: In the multi-cell multiuser multi-input multi-output (MU-MIMO) systems, fractional programming (FP) has demonstrated considerable effectiveness in optimizing beamforming vectors, yet it suffers from high computational complexity. Recent improvements demonstrate reduced complexity by avoiding large-dimension matrix inversions (i.e., FastFP) and faster convergence by learning to unfold the FastFP algorithm (i.e., DeepFP).

Title: Studying the Role of Synthetic Data for Machine Learning-based Wireless Networks Traffic Forecasting
Authors: José Pulido, Francesc Wilhelmi, Sergio Fortes, Alfonso Fernández-Durán, Lorenzo Galati Giordano, Raquel Barco
Abstract: Synthetic data generation is an appealing tool for augmenting and enriching datasets, playing a crucial role in advancing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Not only does synthetic data help build robust AI/ML datasets cost-effectively, but it also offers privacy-friendly solutions and bypasses the complexities of storing large data volumes. This paper proposes a novel method to generate synthetic data, based on first-order auto-regressive noise statistics, for large-scale Wi-Fi deployments. The approach operates with minimal real data requirements while producing statistically rich traffic patterns that effectively mimic real Access Point (AP) behavior. Experimental results show that ML models trained on synthetic data achieve Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values within 10 to 15 of those obtained using real data when trained on the same APs, while requiring significantly less training data. Moreover, when generalization is required, synthetic-data-trained models improve prediction accuracy by up to 50 percent compared to real-data-trained baselines, thanks to the enhanced variability and diversity of the generated traces. Overall, the proposed method bridges the gap between synthetic data generation and practical Wi-Fi traffic forecasting, providing a scalable, efficient, and real-time solution for modern wireless networks.

Title: Learning to accelerate Krasnosel'skii-Mann fixed-point iterations with guarantees
Authors: Andrea Martin, Giuseppe Belgioioso
Abstract: We introduce a principled learning to optimize (L2O) framework for solving fixed-point problems involving general nonexpansive mappings. Our idea is to deliberately inject summable perturbations into a standard Krasnosel'skii-Mann iteration to improve its average-case performance over a specific distribution of problems while retaining its convergence guarantees. Under a metric sub-regularity assumption, we prove that the proposed parametrization includes only iterations that locally achieve linear convergence-up to a vanishing bias term-and that it encompasses all iterations that do so at a sufficiently fast rate. We then demonstrate how our framework can be used to augment several widely-used operator splitting methods to accelerate the solution of structured monotone inclusion problems, and validate our approach on a best approximation problem using an L2O-augmented Douglas-Rachford splitting algorithm.

Title: Safe Navigation under Uncertain Obstacle Dynamics using Control Barrier Functions and Constrained Convex Generators
Authors: Hugo Matias, Daniel Silvestre
Abstract: This paper presents a sampled-data framework for the safe navigation of controlled agents in environments cluttered with obstacles governed by uncertain linear dynamics. Collision-free motion is achieved by combining Control Barrier Function (CBF)-based safety filtering with set-valued state estimation using Constrained Convex Generators (CCGs). At each sampling time, a CCG estimate of each obstacle is obtained using a finite-horizon guaranteed estimation scheme and propagated over the sampling interval to obtain a CCG-valued flow that describes the estimated obstacle evolution. However, since CCGs are defined indirectly - as an affine transformation of a generator set subject to equality constraints, rather than as a sublevel set of a scalar function - converting the estimated obstacle flows into CBFs is a nontrivial task. One of the main contributions of this paper is a procedure to perform this conversion, ultimately yielding a CBF via a convex optimization problem whose validity is established by the Implicit Function Theorem. The resulting obstacle-specific CBFs are then merged into a single CBF that is used to design a safe controller through the standard Quadratic Program (QP)-based approach. Since CCGs support Minkowski sums, the proposed framework also naturally handles rigid-body agents and generalizes existing CBF-based rigid-body navigation designs to arbitrary agent and obstacle geometries. While the main contribution is general, the paper primarily focuses on agents with first-order control-affine dynamics and second-order strict-feedback dynamics. Simulation examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: Lagrangian Grid-based Estimation of Nonlinear Systems with Invertible Dynamics
Authors: Jindřich Duník, Jan Krejčí, Jakub Matoušek, Marek Brandner, Yeongkwon Choe
Abstract: This paper deals with the state estimation of non-linear and non-Gaussian systems with an emphasis on the numerical solution to the Bayesian recursive relations. In particular, this paper builds upon the Lagrangian grid-based filter (GbF) recently-developed for linear systems and extends it for systems with nonlinear dynamics that are invertible. The proposed nonlinear Lagrangian GbF reduces the computational complexity of the standard GbFs from quadratic to log-linear, while preserving all the strengths of the original GbF such as robustness, accuracy, and deterministic behaviour. The proposed filter is compared with the particle filter in several numerical studies using the publicly available MATLAB\textregistered\ implementation\footnote{this https URL}.

Title: Tensor Decompositions for Online Grid-Based Terrain-Aided Navigation
Authors: J. Matoušek, J. Krejčí, J. Duník, R. Zanetti
Abstract: This paper presents a practical and scalable grid-based state estimation method for high-dimensional models with invertible linear dynamics and with highly non-linear measurements, such as the nearly constant velocity model with measurements of e.g. altitude, bearing, and/or range. Unlike previous tensor decomposition-based approaches, which have largely remained at the proof-of-concept stage, the proposed method delivers an efficient and practical solution by exploiting decomposable model structure-specifically, block-diagonal dynamics and sparsely coupled measurement dimensions. The algorithm integrates a Lagrangian formulation for the time update and leverages low-rank tensor decompositions to compactly represent and effectively propagate state densities. This enables real-time estimation for models with large state dimension, significantly extending the practical reach of grid-based filters beyond their traditional low-dimensional use. Although demonstrated in the context of terrain-aided navigation, the method is applicable to a wide range of models with decomposable structure. The computational complexity and estimation accuracy depend on the specific structure of the model. All experiments are fully reproducible, with source code provided alongside this paper (GitHub link: this https URL).

Title: Predefined-time One-Shot Cooperative Estimation, Guidance, and Control for Simultaneous Target Interception
Authors: Lohitvel Gopikannan, Shashi Ranjan Kumar, Abhinav Sinha
Abstract: This work develops a unified nonlinear estimation-guidance-control framework for cooperative simultaneous interception of a stationary target under a heterogeneous sensing topology, where sensing capabilities are non-uniform across interceptors. Specifically, only a subset of agents is instrumented with onboard seekers (informed/seeker-equipped agents), whereas the rest of them (seeker-less agents) acquire the information about the target indirectly via the informed agents and execute a distributed cooperative guidance for simultaneous target interception. To address the resulting partial observability, a predefined-time distributed observer is leveraged, guaranteeing convergence of the target state estimates for seeker-less agents through information exchange with seeker-equipped neighbors over a directed communication graph. Thereafter, an improved time-to-go estimate accounting for wide launch envelopes is utilized to design the distributed cooperative guidance commands. This estimate is coupled with a predefined-time consensus protocol, ensuring consensus in the agents' time-to-go values. The temporal upper bounds within which both observer error and time-to-go consensus error converge to zero can be prescribed as design parameters. Furthermore, the cooperative guidance commands are realized by means of an autopilot, wherein the interceptor is steered by canard actuation. The corresponding fin deflection commands are generated using a predefined-time convergent sliding mode control law. This enables the autopilot to precisely track the commanded lateral acceleration within a design-specified time, while maintaining non-singularity of the overall design. Theoretical guarantees are supported by numerical simulations across diverse engagement geometries, verifying the estimation accuracy, the cooperative interception performance, and the autopilot response using the proposed scheme.

Title: Affordable Data Collection System for UAVs Taxi Vibration Testing
Authors: Chaoyi Lin Yang, Gabriele Dessena, Oscar E. Bonilla-Manrique
Abstract: Structural vibration testing plays a key role in aerospace engineering for evaluating dynamic behaviour, ensuring reliability and verifying structural integrity. These tests rely on accurate and robust data acquisition systems (DAQ) to capture high-quality acceleration data. However, commercial DAQs that provide the required performance and features are often expensive and complex, limiting their accessibility for small-scale research and experimental applications. This work presents the design and experimental validation of an affordable and in-house-developed acceleration DAQ, tested on a small fixed-wing UAV through several Taxi Vibration Test (TVT) runs and ambient vibration measurements. The proposed system integrates several OrangePi 3 LTS single-board computers with multiple LSM6DS3TR-C MEMS inertial measurement units operating simultaneously via an Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) communication interface, managed under a Python-based master/slave architecture. Data is acquired at a stable sampling rate of approximately 208 Hz and post-processed using Welch's method to estimate their Power Spectral Density (PSD). Results confirm the system ability to provide consistent multi-sensor acceleration data and repeatable PSD profiles under the same test conditions; thus, demonstrating its reliability. With a total hardware cost below 600 EUR (approximately 690 USD), the developed DAQ offers a compact, scalable and cost-effective alternative for aerospace vibration analysis and structural testing.

Title: Video Generation Models in Robotics - Applications, Research Challenges, Future Directions
Authors: Zhiting Mei, Tenny Yin, Ola Shorinwa, Apurva Badithela, Zhonghe Zheng, Joseph Bruno, Madison Bland, Lihan Zha, Asher Hancock, Jaime Fernández Fisac, Philip Dames, Anirudha Majumdar
Abstract: Video generation models have emerged as high-fidelity models of the physical world, capable of synthesizing high-quality videos capturing fine-grained interactions between agents and their environments conditioned on multi-modal user inputs. Their impressive capabilities address many of the long-standing challenges faced by physics-based simulators, driving broad adoption in many problem domains, e.g., robotics. For example, video models enable photorealistic, physically consistent deformable-body simulation without making prohibitive simplifying assumptions, which is a major bottleneck in physics-based simulation. Moreover, video models can serve as foundation world models that capture the dynamics of the world in a fine-grained and expressive way. They thus overcome the limited expressiveness of language-only abstractions in describing intricate physical interactions. In this survey, we provide a review of video models and their applications as embodied world models in robotics, encompassing cost-effective data generation and action prediction in imitation learning, dynamics and rewards modeling in reinforcement learning, visual planning, and policy evaluation. Further, we highlight important challenges hindering the trustworthy integration of video models in robotics, which include poor instruction following, hallucinations such as violations of physics, and unsafe content generation, in addition to fundamental limitations such as significant data curation, training, and inference costs. We present potential future directions to address these open research challenges to motivate research and ultimately facilitate broader applications, especially in safety-critical settings.

Title: Personalized Spiking Neural Networks with Ferroelectric Synapses for EEG Signal Processing
Authors: Nikhil Garg, Anxiong Song, Niklas Plessnig, Nathan Savoia, Laura Bégon-Lours
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are strongly affected by non-stationary neural signals that vary across sessions and individuals, limiting the generalization of subject-agnostic models and motivating adaptive and personalized learning on resource-constrained platforms. Programmable memristive hardware offers a promising substrate for such post-deployment adaptation; however, practical realization is challenged by limited weight resolution, device variability, nonlinear programming dynamics, and finite device endurance. In this work, we show that spiking neural networks (SNNs) can be deployed on ferroelectric memristive synaptic devices for adaptive EEG-based motor imagery decoding under realistic device constraints. We fabricate, characterize, and model ferroelectric synapses. We evaluate a convolutional-recurrent SNN architecture under two complementary deployment strategies: (i) device-aware training using a ferroelectric synapse model, and (ii) transfer of software-trained weights followed by low-overhead on-device re-tuning. To enable efficient adaptation, we introduce a device-aware weight-update strategy in which gradient-based updates are accumulated digitally and converted into discrete programming events only when a threshold is exceeded, emulating nonlinear, state-dependent programming dynamics while reducing programming frequency. Both deployment strategies achieve classification performance comparable to state-of-the-art software-based SNNs. Furthermore, subject-specific transfer learning achieved by retraining only the final network layers improves classification accuracy. These results demonstrate that programmable ferroelectric hardware can support robust, low-overhead adaptation in spiking neural networks, opening a practical path toward personalized neuromorphic processing of neural signals.

Title: First Multi-Constellation Observations of Navigation Satellite Signals in the Lunar Domain by Post-Processing L1/L5 IQ Snapshots
Authors: Lorenzo Sciacca, Alex Minetto, Andrea Nardin, Fabio Dovis, Luca Canzian, Mario Musmeci, Claudia Facchinetti, Giancarlo Varacalli
Abstract: The use of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) to increase spacecraft autonomy for orbit determination has gained renewed momentum following the Lunar GNSS Receiver Experiment (LuGRE), which demonstrated feasible onboard GPS and Galileo signal reception and tracking at lunar distances. This work processes in-phase and quadrature (IQ) snapshots collected by the LuGRE receiver in cis-lunar space and on the lunar surface to assess multi-frequency, multi-constellation signal availability. Signals from additional systems beyond GPS and Galileo, including RNSS and SBAS constellations, are observable and successfully acquired exclusively in the recorded IQ snapshots. These observations provide the first experimental evidence that signals from multiple constellations, including systems not supported by LuGRE realtime operations, are detectable at unprecedented distances from Earth. Useful observables can be extracted from the IQ snapshots, despite minimal sampling rates, 4-bit quantization, and short durations (200 ms-2 s), through a hybrid coherent/non-coherent acquisition stage compensating for code Doppler. These observations are exploited to tune simulation tools and to perform extended simulation campaigns, showing that the inclusion of additional constellations significantly improves availability; for a 26 dB-Hz acquisition threshold, the fraction of epochs with at least four visible satellites increases from 11% to 46% of the total epoch count. These findings indicate that BeiDou, RNSS, and SBAS signals can substantially enhance GNSS-based autonomy for lunar and cislunar missions.

Title: AzeroS: Extending LLM to Speech with Self-Generated Instruction-Free Tuning
Authors: Yiwen Shao, Wei Liu, Jiahong Li, Tianzi Wang, Kun Wei, Meng Yu, Dong Yu
Abstract: Extending large language models (LLMs) to the speech domain has recently gained significant attention. A typical approach connects a pretrained LLM with an audio encoder through a projection module and trains the resulting model on large-scale, task-specific instruction-tuning datasets. However, curating such instruction-tuning data for specific requirements is time-consuming, and models trained in this manner often generalize poorly to unseen tasks. In this work, we first formulate that the strongest generalization of a speech-LLM is achieved when it is trained with Self-Generated Instruction-Free Tuning (SIFT), in which supervision signals are generated by a frozen LLM using textual representations of speech as input. Our proposed SIFT paradigm eliminates the need for collecting task-specific question-answer pairs and yields the theoretically best generalization to unseen tasks. Building upon this paradigm, we introduce AZeroS (Auden Zero-instruction-tuned Speech-LLM), which is trained on speech-text pairs derived from publicly available corpora, including approximately 25,000 hours of speech with ASR transcripts and 3,000 hours of speech with paralinguistic labels. Built upon Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, the model updates only two lightweight projection modules (23.8 million parameters each), while keeping both the LLM and audio encoders frozen. Despite the minimal training cost and modest data scale, AZeroS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both semantic and paralinguistic benchmarks, including VoiceBench, AIR-Bench Foundation (Speech), and AIR-Bench Chat (Speech).

Title: DeeperBrain: A Neuro-Grounded EEG Foundation Model Towards Universal BCI
Authors: Jiquan Wang, Sha Zhao, Yangxuan Zhou, Yiming Kang, Shijian Li, Gang Pan
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models hold significant promise for universal Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). However, existing approaches often rely on end-to-end fine-tuning and exhibit limited efficacy under frozen-probing protocols, lacking the intrinsic universality required for broad generalization. This limitation stems from adapting general-purpose sequence architectures that overlook the biophysical and dynamical principles of neural activity. To bridge this gap, we propose DeeperBrain, a neuro-grounded foundation model integrating domain-specific inductive biases into its model design and learning objectives. Architecturally, DeeperBrain incorporates a volume conduction-aware channel encoding to model spatial mixing via 3D geometry, and a neurodynamics-aware temporal encoding capturing slow adaptations using oscillatory and exponential bases. For pretraining, we introduce a dual-objective strategy combining Masked EEG Reconstruction (MER) for local fidelity and Neurodynamics Statistics Prediction (NSP). NSP enforces alignment with macroscopic brain states by predicting interpretable order parameters, including spectral power, functional connectivity, cross-frequency coupling, and dynamic complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeeperBrain achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance under end-to-end fine-tuning. Crucially, it maintains superior efficacy under a rigorous frozen-probing protocol, verifying that embedding neuroscientific first principles endows learned representations with the intrinsic universality essential for universal BCI. The code will be publicly available.

Title: Continual Quantum Architecture Search with Tensor-Train Encoding: Theory and Applications to Signal Processing
Authors: Jun Qi, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Pin-Yu Chen, Javier Tejedor, Ling Li, Min-Hsiu Hsieh
Abstract: We introduce CL-QAS, a continual quantum architecture search framework that mitigates the challenges of costly amplitude encoding and catastrophic forgetting in variational quantum circuits. The method uses Tensor-Train encoding to efficiently compress high-dimensional stochastic signals into low-rank quantum feature representations. A bi-loop learning strategy separates circuit parameter optimization from architecture exploration, while an Elastic Weight Consolidation regularization ensures stability across sequential tasks. We derive theoretical upper bounds on approximation, generalization, and robustness under quantum noise, demonstrating that CL-QAS achieves controllable expressivity, sample-efficient generalization, and smooth convergence without barren plateaus. Empirical evaluations on electrocardiogram (ECG)-based signal classification and financial time-series forecasting confirm substantial improvements in accuracy, balanced accuracy, F1 score, and reward. CL-QAS maintains strong forward and backward transfer and exhibits bounded degradation under depolarizing and readout noise, highlighting its potential for adaptive, noise-resilient quantum learning on near-term devices.

Title: Robust and Secure Blockage-Aware Pinching Antenna-assisted Wireless Communication
Authors: Ruotong Zhao, Shaokang Hu, Deepak Mishra, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a blockage-aware pinching antenna (PA) system designed for secure and robust wireless communication. The considered system comprises a base station equipped with multiple waveguides, each hosting multiple PAs, and serves multiple single-antenna legitimate users in the presence of multi-antenna eavesdroppers under imperfect channel state information (CSI). To safeguard confidential transmissions, artificial noise (AN) is deliberately injected to degrade the eavesdropping channels. Recognizing that conventional linear CSI-error bounds become overly conservative for spatially distributed PA architectures, we develop new geometry-aware uncertainty sets that jointly characterize eavesdroppers position and array-orientation errors. Building upon these sets, we formulate a robust joint optimization problem that determines per-waveguide beamforming and AN covariance, individual PA power-ratio allocation, and PA positions to maximize the system sum rate subject to secrecy constraints. The highly non-convex design problem is efficiently addressed via a low computational complexity iterative algorithm that capitalizes on block coordinate descent, penalty-based methods, majorization-minimization, the S-procedure, and Lipschitz-based surrogate functions. Simulation results demonstrate that sum rates for the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional fixed antenna systems by 4.7 dB, offering substantially improved rate and secrecy performance. In particular, (i) adaptive PA positioning preserves LoS to legitimate users while effectively exploiting waveguide geometry to disrupt eavesdropper channels, and (ii) neglecting blockage effects in the PA system significantly impacts the system design, leading to performance degradation and inadequate secrecy guarantees.

Authors: Andrei A. Korigodskii, Artem E. Vasiunik, Georgii A. Varin, Adilia M. Zukhurova, Matvei V. Urvantsev, Semen A. Osipenkov, Igor S. Efremov, Georgii E. Bondar
Abstract: The integration of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into large-scale artistic projects has emerged as a new application in robotics. This paper presents the design, deployment, and testing of a novel multi-drone system for automated mural painting in outdoor settings. This technology makes use of new software that coordinates multiple drones simultaneously, utilizing state-machine algorithms for task execution. Key advancements are the complex positioning system that combines 2D localization using a single motion tracking camera with onboard LiDAR for precise positioning, and a novel flight control algorithm, which works differently along the trajectory and normally to it, ensuring smoothness and high precision of the drawings at the same time. A 100 square meters mural was created using the developed multi-drone system, validating the system's efficacy. Compared to single-drone approaches, our multi-UAV solution significantly improves scalability and operational speed while maintaining high stability even in harsh weather conditions. The findings highlight the potential of autonomous robotic swarms in creative applications, paving the way for further advancements in large-scale robotic art.

Title: Pareto-Optimal Model Selection for Low-Cost, Single-Lead EMG Control in Embedded Systems
Authors: Carl Vincent Ladres Kho
Abstract: Consumer-grade biosensors offer a cost-effective alternative to medical-grade electromyography (EMG) systems, reducing hardware costs from thousands of dollars to approximately $13. However, these low-cost sensors introduce significant signal instability and motion artifacts. Deploying machine learning models on resource-constrained edge devices like the ESP32 presents a challenge: balancing classification accuracy with strict latency (<100ms) and memory (<320KB) constraints. Using a single-subject dataset comprising 1,540 seconds of raw data (1.54M data points, segmented into ~1,300 one-second windows), I evaluate 18 model architectures, ranging from statistical heuristics to deep transfer learning (ResNet50) and custom hybrid networks (MaxCRNN). While my custom "MaxCRNN" (Inception + Bi-LSTM + Attention) achieved the highest safety (99% Precision) and robustness, I identify Random Forest (74% accuracy) as the Pareto-optimal solution for embedded control on legacy microcontrollers. I demonstrate that reliable, low-latency EMG control is feasible on commodity hardware, with Deep Learning offering a path to near-perfect reliability on modern Edge AI accelerators.

Title: Digital Predistortion of Power Amplifiers for Quantum Computing
Authors: Marvin Jaeger, Bartosz Tegowski, Georg Frederik Riemschneider, Alexander Koelpin
Abstract: Power amplifiers (PA) are essential for microwavecontrolled trapped-ion and semiconductor spin based quantum computers (QC). They adjust the power level of the control signal and therefore the processing time of the QC. Their nonlinearities and memory effects degrade the signal quality and, thus, the fidelity of qubit gate operations. Driving the PA with a significant input power back-off reduces nonlinear effects but is neither power-efficient nor cost-effective. To overcome this limitation, this letter augments the conventional signal generation system applied in QCs by digital predistortion (DPD) to linearize the radio frequency (RF) channel. Numerical analysis of the qubit behavior based on measured representative control signals indicates that DPD improves its fidelity.

Title: Visible Light Communication using Led-Based AR Markers for Robot Localization
Authors: Wataru Uemura, Shogo Kawasaki
Abstract: A method of information transmission using visual markers has been widely studied. In this approach, information or identifiers (IDs) are encoded in the black-and-white pattern of each marker. By analyzing the geometric properties of the marker frame - such as its size, distortion, and coordinates - the relative position and orientation between the camera and the marker can be estimated. Furthermore, by associating the positional information of each marker with its corresponding ID, the position of the camera that takes the image picture can be calculated. In the field of mobile robotics, such markers are commonly utilized for robot localization. As mobile robots become more widely used in everyday environments, such visual markers are expected to be utilized across various contexts. In environments where robots collaborate with humans - such as in cell-based manufacturing systems in factories or in domestic settings with partner robots - it is desirable for such markers to be designed in a manner that appears natural and unobtrusive to humans. In this paper, we propose a method for implementing an ArUco marker in the form of illumination. In the proposed method, LEDs are arranged in accordance with the grid pattern of the marker, and the blinking frequency of each LED is determined based on the corresponding black or white cell. As a result, the illumination appears uniformly bright to the human eye, while the camera can capture variations in the blinking frequency. From these differences, the black-and-white pattern can be reconstructed, enabling the identification of the marker's tag information. We develop a prototype system, and conduct experiments which are conducted to evaluate its performance in terms of recognition accuracy under varying distances and viewing angles with respect to the ArUco marker.

Title: Non-volatile Programmable Photonic Integrated Circuits using Mechanically Latched MEMS: A System-Level Scheme Enabling Power-Connection-Free Operation Without Performance Compromise
Authors: Ran Tao, Jifang Qiu, Zhimeng Liu, Hongxiang Guo, Yan Li, Jian Wu
Abstract: Programmable photonic integrated circuits (PPICs) offer a versatile platform for implementing diverse optical functions on a generic hardware mesh. However, the scalability of PPICs faces critical power consumption barriers. Therefore, we propose a novel non-volatile PPIC architecture utilizing MEMS with mechanical latching, enabling stable passive operation without any power connection once configured. To ensure practical applicability, we present a system-level solution including both this hardware innovation and an accompanying automatic error-resilient configuration algorithm. The algorithm compensates for the lack of continuous tunability inherent in the non-volatile hardware design, thereby enabling such new operational paradigm without compromising performance, and also ensuring robustness against fabrication errors. Functional simulations were performed to validate the proposed scheme by configuring five distinct functionalities of varying complexity, including a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI), a MZI lattice filter, a ring resonator (ORR), a double ORR ring-loaded MZI, and a triple ORR coupled resonator waveguide filter. The results demonstrate that our non-volatile scheme achieves performance equivalent to conventional PPICs. Robustness analysis was also conducted, and the results demonstrated that our scheme exhibits strong robustness against various fabrication errors. Furthermore, we explored the trade-off between the hardware design complexity of such non-volatile scheme and its performance. This study establishes a viable pathway to a new generation of power-connection-free PPICs, providing a practical and scalable solution for future photonic systems.

Title: S-DAPT-2026: A Stage-Aware Synthetic Dataset for Advanced Persistent Threat Detection
Authors: Saleem Ishaq Tijjani, Bogdan Ghita, Nathan Clarke, Matthew Craven
Abstract: The detection of advanced persistent threats (APTs) remains a crucial challenge due to their stealthy, multistage nature and the limited availability of realistic, labeled datasets for systematic evaluation. Synthetic dataset generation has emerged as a practical approach for modeling APT campaigns; however, existing methods often rely on computationally expensive alert correlation mechanisms that limit scalability. Motivated by these limitations, this paper presents a near realistic synthetic APT dataset and an efficient alert correlation framework. The proposed approach introduces a machine learning based correlation module that employs K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) clustering with a cosine similarity metric to group semantically related alerts within a temporal context. The dataset emulates multistage APT campaigns across campus and organizational network environments and captures a diverse set of fourteen distinct alert types, exceeding the coverage of commonly used synthetic APT datasets. In addition, explicit APT campaign states and alert to stage mappings are defined to enable flexible integration of new alert types and support stage aware analysis. A comprehensive statistical characterization of the dataset is provided to facilitate reproducibility and support APT stage predictions.

Title: Water Demand Maximization: Quick Recovery of Nonlinear Physics Solutions
Authors: Sai Krishna Kanth Hari, Russell Bent
Abstract: Determining the maximum demand a water distribution network can satisfy is crucial for ensuring reliable supply and planning network expansion. This problem, typically formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), is computationally challenging. A common strategy to address this challenge is to solve mixed-integer linear program (MILP) relaxations derived by partitioning variable domains and constructing linear over- and under-estimators to nonlinear constraints over each partition. While MILP relaxations are easier to solve up to a modest level of partitioning, their solutions often violate nonlinear water flow physics. Thus, recovering feasible MINLP solutions from the MILP relaxations is crucial for enhancing MILP-based approaches. In this paper, we propose a robust solution recovery method that efficiently computes feasible MINLP solutions from MILP relaxations, regardless of partition granularity. Combined with iterative partition refinement, our method generates a sequence of feasible solutions that progressively approach the optimum. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline methods and direct MINLP solves by consistently recovering high-quality feasible solutions with significantly reduced computation times.

Abstract: Understanding the structure of complex, nonstationary, high-dimensional time-evolving signals is a central challenge in scientific data analysis. In many domains, such as speech and biomedical signal processing, the ability to learn disentangled and interpretable representations is critical for uncovering latent generative mechanisms. Traditional approaches to unsupervised representation learning, including variational autoencoders (VAEs), often struggle to capture the temporal and spectral diversity inherent in such data. Here we introduce variational decomposition autoencoding (VDA), a framework that extends VAEs by incorporating a strong structural bias toward signal decomposition. VDA is instantiated through variational decomposition autoencoders (DecVAEs), i.e., encoder-only neural networks that combine a signal decomposition model, a contrastive self-supervised task, and variational prior approximation to learn multiple latent subspaces aligned with time-frequency characteristics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DecVAEs on simulated data and three publicly available scientific datasets, spanning speech recognition, dysarthria severity evaluation, and emotional speech classification. Our results demonstrate that DecVAEs surpass state-of-the-art VAE-based methods in terms of disentanglement quality, generalization across tasks, and the interpretability of latent encodings. These findings suggest that decomposition-aware architectures can serve as robust tools for extracting structured representations from dynamic signals, with potential applications in clinical diagnostics, human-computer interaction, and adaptive neurotechnologies.

Title: qAttCNN - Self Attention Mechanism for Video QoE Prediction in Encrypted Traffic
Authors: Michael Sidorov, Ofer Hadar
Abstract: The rapid growth of multimedia consumption, driven by major advances in mobile devices since the mid-2000s, has led to widespread use of video conferencing applications (VCAs) such as Zoom and Google Meet, as well as instant messaging applications (IMAs) like WhatsApp and Telegram, which increasingly support video conferencing as a core feature. Many of these systems rely on the Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) protocol, enabling direct peer-to-peer media streaming without requiring a third-party server to relay data, reducing the latency and facilitating a real-time communication. Despite WebRTC's potential, adverse network conditions can degrade streaming quality and consequently reduce users' Quality of Experience (QoE). Maintaining high QoE therefore requires continuous monitoring and timely intervention when QoE begins to deteriorate. While content providers can often estimate QoE by directly comparing transmitted and received media, this task is significantly more challenging for internet service providers (ISPs). End-to-end encryption, commonly used by modern VCAs and IMAs, prevent ISPs from accessing the original media stream, leaving only Quality of Service (QoS) and routing information available. To address this limitation, we propose the QoE Attention Convolutional Neural Network (qAttCNN), a model that leverages packet size parameter of the traffic to infer two no-reference QoE metrics viz. BRISQUE and frames per second (FPS). We evaluate qAttCNN on a custom dataset collected from WhatsApp video calls and compare it against existing QoE models. Using mean absolute error percentage (MAEP), our approach achieves 2.14% error for BRISQUE and 7.39% for FPS prediction.

Title: Understanding the Performance Behaviors of End-to-End Protein Design Pipelines on GPUs
Authors: Jinwoo Hwang, Yeongmin Hwang, Tadiwos Meaza, Hyeonbin Bae, Jongse Park
Abstract: Recent computational advances enable protein design pipelines to run end-to-end on GPUs, yet their heterogeneous computational behaviors remain undercharacterized at the system level. We implement and profile a representative pipeline at both component and full-pipeline granularities across varying inputs and hyperparameters. Our characterization identifies generally low GPU utilization and high sensitivity to sequence length and sampling strategies. We outline future research directions based on these insights and release an open-source pipeline and profiling scripts to facilitate further studies.

Title: Directional Selective Fixed-Filter Active Noise Control Based on a Convolutional Neural Network in Reverberant Environments
Authors: Boxiang Wang, Zhengding Luo, Haowen Li, Dongyuan Shi, Junwei Ji, Ziyi Yang, Woon-Seng Gan
Abstract: Selective fixed-filter active noise control (SFANC) is a novel approach capable of mitigating noise with varying frequency characteristics. It offers faster response and greater computational efficiency compared to traditional adaptive algorithms. However, spatial factors, particularly the influence of the noise source location, are often overlooked. Some existing studies have explored the impact of the direction-of-arrival (DoA) of the noise source on ANC performance, but they are mostly limited to free-field conditions and do not consider the more complex indoor reverberant environments. To address this gap, this paper proposes a learning-based directional SFANC method that incorporates the DoA of the noise source in reverberant environments. In this framework, multiple reference signals are processed by a convolutional neural network (CNN) to estimate the azimuth and elevation angles of the noise source, as well as to identify the most appropriate control filter for effective noise cancellation. Compared to traditional adaptive algorithms, the proposed approach achieves superior noise reduction with shorter response times, even in the presence of reverberations.

Title: Neuromorphic FPGA Design for Digital Signal Processing
Authors: Justin London
Abstract: In this paper, the foundations of neuromorphic computing, spiking neural networks (SNNs) and memristors, are analyzed and discussed. Neuromorphic computing is then applied to FPGA design for digital signal processing (DSP). Finite impulse response (FIR) and infinite impulse response (IIR) filters are implemented with and without neuromorphic computing in Vivado using Verilog HDL. The results suggest that neuromorphic computing can provide low-latency and synaptic plasticity thereby enabling continuous on-chip learning. Due to their parallel and event-driven nature, neuromorphic computing can reduce power consumption by eliminating von Neumann bottlenecks and improve efficiency, but at the cost of reduced numeric precision.

Title: Adaptive Robust Control for Uncertain Systems with Ellipsoid-Set Learning
Authors: Xuehui Ma, Shiliang Zhang, Zhiyong Sun, Xiaohui Zhang, Sabita Maharjan
Abstract: Despite the celebrated success of stochastic control approaches for uncertain systems, such approaches are limited in the ability to handle non-Gaussian uncertainties. This work presents an adaptive robust control for linear uncertain systems, whose process noise, observation noise, and system states are depicted by ellipsoid sets rather than Gaussian distributions. We design an ellipsoid-set learning method to estimate the boundaries of state sets, and incorporate the learned sets into the control law derivation to reduce conservativeness in robust control. Further, we consider the parametric uncertainties in state-space matrices. Particularly, we assign finite candidates for the uncertain parameters, and construct a bank of candidate-conditional robust control problems for each candidate. We derive the final control law by aggregating the candidate-conditional control laws. In this way, we separate the control scheme into parallel robust controls, decoupling the learning and control, which otherwise renders the control unattainable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control in numerical simulations in the cases of linear quadratic regulation and tracking control.

Title: TranSC: Hardware-Aware Design of Transcendental Functions Using Stochastic Logic
Authors: Mehran Moghadam, Sercan Aygun, M.Hassan Najafi
Abstract: The hardware-friendly implementation of transcendental functions remains a longstanding challenge in design automation. These functions, which cannot be expressed as finite combinations of algebraic operations, pose significant complexity in digital circuit design. This study introduces a novel approach, TranSC, that utilizes stochastic computing (SC) for lightweight yet accurate implementation of transcendental functions. Building on established SC techniques, our method explores alternative random sources-specifically, quasi-random Van der Corput low-discrepancy (LD) sequences-instead of conventional pseudo-randomness. This shift enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of SC-based computations. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on various function types, including trigonometric, hyperbolic, and activation functions. The proposed design approach significantly reduces MSE by up to 98% compared to the state-of-the-art solutions while reducing hardware area, power consumption, and energy usage by 33%, 72%, and 64%, respectively.

Title: Quantum-Compatible Dictionary Learning via Doubly Sparse Models
Authors: Angshul Majumdar
Abstract: Dictionary learning (DL) is a core tool in signal processing and machine learning for discovering sparse representations of data. In contrast with classical successes, there is currently no practical quantum dictionary learning algorithm. We argue that this absence stems from structural mismatches between classical DL formulations and the operational constraints of quantum computing. We identify the fundamental bottlenecks that prevent efficient quantum realization of classical DL and show how a structurally restricted model, doubly sparse dictionary learning (DSDL), naturally avoids these problems. We present a simple, hybrid quantum-classical algorithm based on projection-based randomized Kaczmarz iterations with Qiskit-compatible quantum inner products. We outline practical considerations and share an open-source implementation at this https URL. The goal is not to claim exponential speedups, but to realign dictionary learning with the realities of near-term quantum devices.

Title: Robust maximum hands-off optimal control: existence, maximum principle, and $L^{0}$-$L^1$ equivalence
Authors: Siddhartha Ganguly, Kenji Kashima
Abstract: This work advances the maximum hands-off sparse control framework by developing a robust counterpart for constrained linear systems with parametric uncertainties. The resulting optimal control problem minimizes an $L^{0}$ objective subject to an uncountable, compact family of constraints, and is therefore a nonconvex, nonsmooth robust optimization problem. To address this, we replace the $L^{0}$ objective with its convex $L^{1}$ surrogate and, using a nonsmooth variant of the robust Pontryagin maximum principle, show that the $L^{0}$ and $L^{1}$ formulations have identical sets of optimal solutions -- we call this the robust hands-off principle. Building on this equivalence, we propose an algorithmic framework -- drawing on numerically viable techniques from the semi-infinite robust optimization literature -- to solve the resulting problems. An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

Title: Examining the Effectiveness of Transformer-Based Smart Contract Vulnerability Scan
Authors: Emre Balci, Timucin Aydede, Gorkem Yilmaz, Ece Gelal Soyak
Abstract: Smart contract technology facilitates self-executing agreements on the blockchain, eliminating dependency on an external trusted authority. However, smart contracts may expose vulnerabilities that can lead to financial losses and disruptions in decentralized applications. In this work, we evaluate deep learning-based approaches for vulnerability scanning of Ethereum smart contracts. We propose VASCOT, a Vulnerability Analyzer for Smart COntracts using Transformers, which performs sequential analysis of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode and incorporates a sliding window mechanism to overcome input length constraints. To assess VASCOT's detection efficacy, we construct a dataset of 16,469 verified Ethereum contracts deployed in 2022, and annotate it using trace analysis with concrete validation to mitigate false positives. VASCOT's performance is then compared against a state-of-the-art LSTM-based vulnerability detection model on both our dataset and an older public dataset. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of each model, providing insights into their detection capabilities and generalizability.

Title: Nonquadratic global asymptotic stability certificates for saturated linear feedbacks
Authors: Andrea Cristofaro, Luca Zaccarian
Abstract: We establish sufficient conditions for positive (semi-)definiteness, with or without radial unboundedness, for nonquadratic Lyapunov function constructed as sign-indefinite quadratic forms involving the state and the deadzone of a suitable input. We then use these conditions to build weak nonquadratic Lyapunov functions establishing global asymptotic stability of linear systems in feedback through a saturation, leveraging invariance principles. Our results are shown to be non-conservative (necessary and sufficient) for a family of well known prototypical examples of linear SISO feedbacks that are not globally exponentially stabilizable (the so-called ANCBI plants). Our multi-input extension leads to convex stability analysis tests, formulated as linear matrix inequalities that are applicable to ANCBI non-globally-exponentially-stabilizable plants.

Title: NanoCockpit: Performance-optimized Application Framework for AI-based Autonomous Nanorobotics
Authors: Elia Cereda, Alessandro Giusti, Daniele Palossi
Abstract: Autonomous nano-drones, powered by vision-based tiny machine learning (TinyML) models, are a novel technology gaining momentum thanks to their broad applicability and pushing scientific advancement on resource-limited embedded systems. Their small form factor, i.e., a few 10s grams, severely limits their onboard computational resources to sub-\SI{100}{\milli\watt} microcontroller units (MCUs). The Bitcraze Crazyflie nano-drone is the \textit{de facto} standard, offering a rich set of programmable MCUs for low-level control, multi-core processing, and radio transmission. However, roboticists very often underutilize these onboard precious resources due to the absence of a simple yet efficient software layer capable of time-optimal pipelining of multi-buffer image acquisition, multi-core computation, intra-MCUs data exchange, and Wi-Fi streaming, leading to sub-optimal control performances. Our \textit{NanoCockpit} framework aims to fill this gap, increasing the throughput and minimizing the system's latency, while simplifying the developer experience through coroutine-based multi-tasking. In-field experiments on three real-world TinyML nanorobotics applications show our framework achieves ideal end-to-end latency, i.e. zero overhead due to serialized tasks, delivering quantifiable improvements in closed-loop control performance ($-$30\% mean position error, mission success rate increased from 40\% to 100\%).

Title: Frequency-Adaptive Multi-Band Architecture for Upper Mid-Band MIMO Systems
Authors: Emiel Vanspranghels, Zhuangzhuang Cui, Sofie Pollin
Abstract: FR3 ($\approx$7-24 GHz), also referred to as the upper mid-band, has recently emerged as promising spectrum for 6G; however, its propagation and MIMO characteristics vary significantly with frequency and environment, and spectrum availability may be intermittent due to incumbents. Using site-specific ray tracing (Sionna RT) in representative indoor and outdoor scenarios, we evaluate 7, 10, 14, 20, and 24 GHz under SISO and MIMO configurations. The results show that FR3 exhibits propagation characteristics intermediate between sub-6 GHz and mmWave bands while supporting meaningful spatial multiplexing, albeit with strong site dependence. Motivated by these findings, we propose a fully digital frequency-adaptive multi-band MIMO architecture that repurposes ADCs/DACs and baseband processing resources across FR3 subbands via switching, enabling dynamic trade-offs between bandwidth (spectrum gain) and antenna consolidation (MIMO gain) under availability and channel constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that exploiting additional spectrum is often optimal, while adaptive resource repurposing becomes beneficial when subbands are unavailable or when multiplexing gains are concentrated at specific frequencies.

Title: Land-then-transport: A Flow Matching-Based Generative Decoder for Wireless Image Transmission
Authors: Jingwen Fu, Ming Xiao, Mikael Skoglund, Dong In Kim
Abstract: Due to strict rate and reliability demands, wireless image transmission remains difficult for both classical layered designs and joint source-channel coding (JSCC), especially under low latency. Diffusion-based generative decoders can deliver strong perceptual quality by leveraging learned image priors, but iterative stochastic denoising leads to high decoding delay. To enable low-latency decoding, we propose a flow-matching (FM) generative decoder under a new land-then-transport (LTT) paradigm that tightly integrates the physical wireless channel into a continuous-time probability flow. For AWGN channels, we build a Gaussian smoothing path whose noise schedule indexes effective noise levels, and derive a closed-form teacher velocity field along this path. A neural-network student vector field is trained by conditional flow matching, yielding a deterministic, channel-aware ODE decoder with complexity linear in the number of ODE steps. At inference, it only needs an estimate of the effective noise variance to set the ODE starting time. We further show that Rayleigh fading and MIMO channels can be mapped, via linear MMSE equalization and singular-value-domain processing, to AWGN-equivalent channels with calibrated starting times. Therefore, the same probability path and trained velocity field can be reused for Rayleigh and MIMO without retraining. Experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and DIV2K over AWGN, Rayleigh, and MIMO demonstrate consistent gains over JPEG2000+LDPC, DeepJSCC, and diffusion-based baselines, while achieving good perceptual quality with only a few ODE steps. Overall, LTT provides a deterministic, physically interpretable, and computation-efficient framework for generative wireless image decoding across diverse channels.

Title: Clipped Affine Policy: Low-Complexity Near-Optimal Online Power Control for Energy Harvesting Communications over Fading Channels
Authors: Hao Wu, Shengtian Yang, Huiguo Gao, Diao Wang, Jun Chen, Guanding Yu
Abstract: This paper investigates online power control for point-to-point energy harvesting communications over wireless fading channels. A linear-policy-based approximation is derived for the relative-value function in the Bellman equation of the power control problem. This approximation leads to two fundamental power control policies: optimistic and robust clipped affine policies, both taking the form of a clipped affine function of the battery level and the reciprocal of channel signal-to-noise ratio coefficient. They are essentially battery-limited weighted directional waterfilling policies operating between adjacent time slots. By leveraging the relative-value approximation and derived policies, a domain-knowledge-enhanced reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed for online power control. The proposed approach is further extended to scenarios with energy and/or channel lookahead. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve a good balance between computational complexity and optimality. In particular, the robust clipped affine policy (combined with RL, using at most five parameters) outperforms all existing approaches across various scenarios, with less than 2\% performance loss relative to the optimal policy.

Title: Enforcing Priority in Schedule-based User Equilibrium Transit Assignment
Authors: Liyang Feng, Hanlin Sun, Yu Marco Nie, Jun Xie, Jiayang Li
Abstract: Denied boarding in congested transit systems induces queuing delays and departure-time shifts that can reshape passenger flows. Correctly modeling these responses in transit assignment hinges on the enforcement of two priority rules: continuance priority for onboard passengers and first-come-first-served (FCFS) boarding among waiting passengers. Existing schedule-based models typically enforce these rules through explicit dynamic loading and group-level expected costs, yet discrete vehicle runs can induce nontrivial within-group cost differences that undermine behavioral consistency. We revisit the implicit-priority framework of Nguyen et al. (2001), which, by encoding boarding priority through the notion of available capacity, characterizes route and departure choices based on realized personal (rather than group-averaged) travel experiences. However, the framework lacks an explicit mathematical formulation and exact computational methods for finding equilibria. Here, we derive an equivalent nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) formulation and establish equilibrium existence under mild conditions. We also show that multiple equilibria may exist, including behaviorally questionable ones. To rule out these artifacts, we propose a refined arc-level NCP formulation that not only corresponds to a tighter, behaviorally consistent equilibrium concept but also is more computationally tractable. We reformulate the NCP as a continuously differentiable mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) and propose two solution algorithms. Numerical studies on benchmark instances and a Hong Kong case study demonstrate that the model reproduces continuance priority and FCFS queuing and captures departure-time shifts driven by the competition for boarding priority.

Title: Converse Barrier Certificates for Finite-time Safety Verification of Continuous-time Perturbed Deterministic Systems
Authors: Yonghan Li, Chenyu Wu, Taoran Wu, Shijie Wang, Bai Xue
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of verifying the finite-time safety of continuous-time perturbed deterministic systems represented by ordinary differential equations in the presence of measurable disturbances. Given a finite-time horizon, if the system is safe, it, starting from a compact initial set, will remain within an open and bounded safe region throughout the specified time horizon, regardless of the disturbances. The main contribution of this work is a converse theorem: we prove that a continuously differentiable, time-dependent barrier certificate exists if and only if the system is safe over the finite-time horizon. The existence problem is explored by finding a continuously differentiable approximation of a unique Lipschitz viscosity solution to a Hamilton-Jacobi equation.

Title: Data-informativity conditions for structured linear systems with implications for dynamic networks
Authors: Paul M.J. Van den Hof, Shengling Shi, Stefanie J.M. Fonken, Karthik R. Ramaswamy, Håkan Hjalmarsson, Arne G. Dankers
Abstract: When estimating a single subsystem (module) in a linear dynamic network with a prediction error method, a data-informativity condition needs to be satisfied for arriving at a consistent module estimate. This concerns a condition on input signals in the constructed, possibly MIMO (multiple input multiple output) predictor model being persistently exciting, which is typically guaranteed if the input spectrum is positive definite for a sufficient number of frequencies. Generically, the condition can be formulated as a path-based condition on the graph of the network model. The current condition has two elements of possible conservatism: (a) rather than focussing on the full MIMO model, one would like to be able to focus on consistently estimating the target module only, and (b) structural information, such as structural zero elements in the interconnection structure or known subsystems, should be taken into account. In this paper relaxed conditions for data-informativity are derived addressing these two issues, leading to relaxed path-based conditions on the network graph. This leads to experimental conditions that are less strict, i.e. require a smaller number of external excitation signals. Additionally, the new expressions for data-informativity in identification are shown to be closely related to earlier derived conditions for (generic) single module identifiability.

Title: Memory-Efficient Training for Text-Dependent SV with Independent Pre-trained Models
Authors: Seyed Ali Farokh, Hossein Zeinali
Abstract: This paper presents our submission to the Iranian division of the Text-Dependent Speaker Verification Challenge (TdSV) 2024. Conventional TdSV approaches typically jointly model speaker and linguistic features, requiring unsegmented inputs during training and incurring high computational costs. Additionally, these methods often fine-tune large-scale pre-trained speaker embedding models on the target domain dataset, which may compromise the pre-trained models' original ability to capture speaker-specific characteristics. To overcome these limitations, we employ a TdSV system that utilizes two pre-trained models independently and demonstrate that, by leveraging pre-trained models with targeted domain adaptation, competitive results can be achieved while avoiding the substantial computational costs associated with joint fine-tuning on unsegmented inputs in conventional approaches. Our best system reached a MinDCF of 0.0358 on the evaluation subset and secured first place in the challenge.

Title: TuneS: Patient-specific model-based optimization of contact configuration in deep brain stimulation
Authors: Anna Franziska Frigge, Lina Uggla, Elena Jiltsova, Markus Fahlström, Dag Nyholm, Alexander Medvedev
Abstract: Objective: The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a systematic approach to optimize Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) parameters, addressing the challenge of identifying patient-specific settings and optimal stimulation targets for various neurological and mental disorders. Methods: TuneS, a novel pipeline to predict clinically optimal DBS contact configurations based on predefined targets and constraints, is introduced. The method relies upon patient-specific models of stimulation spread and extends optimization beyond traditional neural structures to include automated, model-based targeting of streamlines. Results: Initial findings show that both the STN motor subdivision and STN motor streamlines are consistently engaged under clinical settings, while regions of avoidance receive minimal stimulation. Given these findings, the value of model-based contact predictions for assessing stimulation targets while observing anatomical constraints is demonstrated at the example of ten Parkinson's disease patients. The predicted settings were generally found to achieve higher target coverages while providing a better trade-off between maximizing target coverage and minimizing stimulation of regions associated with side effects. Conclusion: TuneS shows promise as a research tool, enabling systematic assessment of DBS target effectiveness and facilitating constraint-aware optimization of stimulation parameters. Significance: The presented pipeline offers a pathway to improve patient-specific DBS therapies and contributes to the broader understanding of effective DBS targeting strategies.

Title: Metasurfaces-Enabled Wave Computing for Future Wireless Systems: Opportunities and Challenges
Authors: Zahra Rahimian Omam, Hamidreza Taghvaee, Ali Araghi, Maria Garcia-Fernandez, Guillermo Alvarez-Narciandi, George C. Alexandropoulos, Okan Yurduseven, Mohsen Khalily
Abstract: The next generations of wireless networks are envisioned to integrate communications, sensing, and computing into a unified platform, demanding ultra-high data rates, submillisecond latency, and unprecedented energy efficiency. However, conventional digital processors face limitations in scalability, cost, and power consumption that hinder this vision. Wave computing, enabled by programmable metasurfaces, offers an alternative paradigm according to which signal processing operations are implemented in the domain of the propagation of electromagnetic waves. This approach transforms metasurfaces from passive wavefront shapers into functional analog processors capable of executing tasks such as beamforming, sensing, imaging, and machine learning at the speed of light with minimal power consumption. This article provides an overview of metasurface-enabled wave computing, highlighting its fundamental principles and key application scenarios for future wireless systems, including integrated sensing and communications, artificial intelligence acceleration, over-the-air channel estimation, and computational electromagnetic imaging. Future research directions are outlined in response to the major open challenges of the technology, aiming to enable large-scale deployment of wave computing in practical wireless networks.

Title: Coverage and Spectral Efficiency of NOMA-Enabled LEO Satellite Networks with Ordering Schemes
Authors: Xiangyu Li, Bodong Shang, Qingqing Wu, Chao Ren
Abstract: This paper investigates an analytical model for low-earth orbit (LEO) multi-satellite downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks. The satellites transmit data to multiple NOMA user terminals (UTs), each employing successive interference cancellation (SIC) for decoding. Two ordering schemes are adopted for NOMA-enabled LEO satellite networks, i.e., mean signal power (MSP)-based ordering and instantaneous signal-to-inter-satellite-interference-plus-noise ratio (ISINR)-based ordering. For each ordering scheme, we derive the analytical expression for the coverage probability of each typical UT. Moreover, we discuss how coverage is influenced by SIC, main-lobe gain, and tradeoffs between the number of satellites and their altitudes. Additionally, two user fairness-based power allocation (PA) schemes are considered, and PA coefficients with the optimal number of UTs that maximize their sum spectral efficiency (SE) are studied. Simulation results show that there exists a maximum effective signal-to-inter-satellite-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold for each PA scheme that ensures the operation of NOMA in LEO satellite networks, and NOMA provides performance gains only when the target SINR is below a certain threshold. Compared with orthogonal multiple access (OMA), NOMA increases UTs' sum SE by as much as 35%. Furthermore, for most SINR thresholds, the sum SE increases with the number of UTs to the highest value, whilst the maximum sum SE is obtained when there are two UTs.

Title: From Alignment to Advancement: Bootstrapping Audio-Language Alignment with Synthetic Data
Authors: Chun-Yi Kuan, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) have recently made great strides in understanding and processing audio inputs. These models are typically adapted from text-based large language models (LLMs) through additional training on audio-related tasks. This adaptation process presents two major limitations. First, ALLMs often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where crucial textual capabilities like instruction-following are lost after training on audio data. In some cases, models may even hallucinate sounds that are not present in the input audio, raising concerns about reliability. Second, achieving cross-modal alignment between audio and language typically relies on large collections of task-specific question-answer pairs for instruction tuning, making it resource-intensive. To address these issues, previous works have leveraged the backbone LLMs to synthesize general-purpose, caption-style alignment data. In this paper, we propose a data generation framework that produces contrastive-like training data, designed to enhance ALLMs' ability to differentiate between present and absent sounds. We further extend our approach to multi-audio scenarios, enabling the model to either explain differences between audio inputs or produce unified captions that describe all inputs, thereby enhancing audio-language alignment. We refer to the entire ALLM training framework as bootstrapping audio-language alignment via synthetic data generation from backbone LLMs (BALSa). Experimental results indicate that our method effectively mitigates audio hallucinations while reliably maintaining strong performance on audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks, as well as instruction-following skills. Moreover, incorporating multi-audio training further enhances the model's comprehension and reasoning capabilities. Overall, BALSa offers an efficient and scalable approach to developing ALLMs.

Title: Ultrasound phase microscopy enables in-vivo label-free super-resolution vascular color flow imaging
Authors: Zhengchang Kou, Junhang Zhang, Chen Gong, Jie Ji, Nathiya Vaithiyalingam Chandra Sekaran, Zikai Wang, Rita J. Miller, Yaoheng Yang, Daniel Adolfo Llano, Qifa Zhou, Michael L. Oelze
Abstract: We introduce ultrasound phase microscopy (UPM), a label-free imaging technique that breaks the diffraction limit using the intrinsic backscatter of red blood cells. By exploiting phase differences between consecutive frames beamformed with mismatched apodizations, UPM extracts sub-wavelength flow information without contrast enhancement. Comprehensive in vivo validation across three species (mouse, rat, rabbit) and three organ systems (brain, spinal cord, kidney) demonstrated spatial resolutions superior to 5 micrometers a tenfold improvement over conventional color flow imaging. Furthermore, UPM accelerates acquisition by nearly two orders of magnitude relative to localization microscopy. These results establish UPM as a robust, translatable approach for routine super-resolution microvascular screening in clinical diagnostics.

Title: Shape-Aware Topological Representation for Pipeline Hyperbola Detection in GPR Data
Authors: Meiyan Kang, Shizuo Kaji, Sang-Yun Lee, Taegon Kim, Hee-Hwan Ryu, Suyoung Choi
Abstract: Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a widely used Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) technique for subsurface exploration, particularly in infrastructure inspection and maintenance. However, conventional interpretation methods are often limited by noise sensitivity and a lack of structural awareness. This study presents a novel framework that enhances the detection of underground utilities, especially pipelines, by integrating shape-aware topological features derived from B-scan GPR images using Topological Data Analysis (TDA), with the spatial detection capabilities of the YOLOv5 deep neural network (DNN). We propose a novel shape-aware topological representation that amplifies structural features in the input data, thereby improving the model's responsiveness to the geometrical features of buried objects. To address the scarcity of annotated real-world data, we employ a Sim2Real strategy that generates diverse and realistic synthetic datasets, effectively bridging the gap between simulated and real-world domains. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP), validating the robustness and efficacy of our approach. This approach underscores the potential of TDA-enhanced learning in achieving reliable, real-time subsurface object detection, with broad applications in urban planning, safety inspection, and infrastructure management.

Title: Generative Diffusion Receivers: Achieving Pilot-Efficient MIMO-OFDM Communications
Authors: Yuzhi Yang, Omar Alhussein, Atefeh Arani, Zhaoyang Zhang, Mérouane Debbah
Abstract: This paper focuses on wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) receivers. Traditional wireless receivers have relied on mathematical modeling and Bayesian inference, achieving remarkable success in most areas but falling short in their ability to characterize channel matrices. Neural networks (NNs) have demonstrated significant potential in this aspect. Nevertheless, integrating traditional inference methods with NNs presents challenges, particularly in tracking the error progression. Given the inevitable presence of noise in wireless systems, generative models that are more resilient to noise are garnering increased attention. In this paper, we propose re-evaluating the MIMO-OFDM receiver using diffusion models, which is a common generative approach. With diffusion models, we can effectively leverage prior knowledge of channel matrices and incorporate traditional signal estimation components. Specifically, we explore the diffusion system and introduce an imagination-screening strategy to guide the diffusion process. Furthermore, diffusion models enable adaptation to varying noise levels and pilot schemes using the same NN, significantly reducing training and deployment costs. Simulated results reveal that, for pilot densities ranging from 4-6 pilots per 64-subcarrier block and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) from -4 dB to 0 dB, our proposed receiver reduces channel-reconstruction error by up to two times compared to leading deep-learning models, with the most pronounced improvements observed in low-pilot conditions. Additionally, performance enhancements can be achieved with a larger imagination size, despite increased computational complexity.

Title: Channel Knowledge Map-assisted Dual-domain Tracking and Predictive Beamforming for High-Mobility Wireless Networks
Authors: Ruolin Du, Zhiqiang Wei, Zai Yang, Lei Yang, Yong Zeng, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng, Jinhong Yuan
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel channel knowledge map (CKM)-assisted dual-domain tracking and predictive beamforming scheme for high-mobility wireless networks. The central premise is that the CKM integrates both the coordinate and beam domains, thereby enabling tracking in one domain via treating the other domain's input as priors or measurements. In the coordinate domain (C-Domain), an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is employed to predict and track the state (i.e., location and velocity) of a moving communication receiver across time slots under both line-of-sight (LoS)-present and LoS-absent conditions, where the CKM provides a prior mapping from multipath channel parameters to potential target locations. In the beam domain (B-Domain), the updated location of the receiver is fed back to CKM to offer a priori information of angle of arrival (AoA) variations, which are incorporated to establish beam transition models for effective beam tracking, depending on the angular variation situation of each path. Then, we analyze the Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB) for AoA estimation for each path in the considered system and propose a jointly predictive beamforming and power allocation design to minimize AoA estimation errors, directly enhancing multipath beam tracking accuracy and indirectly improving target tracking performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves significant improvements in both target and beam tracking performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in AoA tracking of non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths, highlighting the potential gain of CKM in facilitating both target and beam tracking in high-mobility communications.

Title: Quantize-Sample-and-Verify: LLM Acceleration via Adaptive Edge-Cloud Speculative Decoding
Authors: Guangyi Zhang, Yunlong Cai, Guanding Yu, Petar Popovski, Osvaldo Simeone
Abstract: In edge-cloud speculative decoding (SD), edge devices equipped with small language models (SLMs) generate draft tokens that are verified by large language models (LLMs) in the cloud. A key bottleneck in such systems is the limited communication bandwidth between edge and cloud, which necessitates quantization of the information transmitted about generated tokens. In this work, we introduce a novel quantize-sample (Q-S) strategy that provably preserves the output distribution of the cloud-based model, ensuring that the verified tokens match the distribution of those that would have been generated directly by the LLM. We develop a throughput model for edge-cloud SD that explicitly accounts for communication latency. Leveraging this model, we propose an adaptive mechanism that optimizes token throughput by dynamically adjusting the draft length and quantization precision in response to both semantic uncertainty and channel conditions. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed Q-S approach significantly improves decoding efficiency in realistic edge-cloud deployment scenarios.

Title: MMMOS: Multi-domain Multi-axis Audio Quality Assessment
Authors: Yi-Cheng Lin, Jia-Hung Chen, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: Accurate audio quality estimation is essential for developing and evaluating audio generation, retrieval, and enhancement systems. Existing non-intrusive assessment models predict a single Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for speech, merging diverse perceptual factors and failing to generalize beyond speech. We propose MMMOS, a no-reference, multi-domain audio quality assessment system that estimates four orthogonal axes: Production Quality, Production Complexity, Content Enjoyment, and Content Usefulness across speech, music, and environmental sounds. MMMOS fuses frame-level embeddings from three pretrained encoders (WavLM, MuQ, and M2D) and evaluates three aggregation strategies with four loss functions. By ensembling the top eight models, MMMOS shows a 20-30% reduction in mean squared error and a 4-5% increase in Kendall's {\tau} versus baseline, gains first place in six of eight Production Complexity metrics, and ranks among the top three on 17 of 32 challenge metrics.

Title: HuiduRep: A Robust Self-Supervised Framework for Learning Neural Representations from Extracellular Recordings
Authors: Feng Cao, Zishuo Feng, Jicong Zhang, Wei Shi
Abstract: Extracellular recordings are transient voltage fluctuations in the vicinity of neurons, serving as a fundamental modality in neuroscience for decoding brain activity at single-neuron resolution. Spike sorting, the process of attributing each detected spike to its corresponding neuron, is a pivotal step in brain sensing pipelines. However, it remains challenging under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), electrode drift and cross-session variability. In this paper, we propose HuiduRep, a robust self-supervised representation learning framework that extracts discriminative and generalizable features from extracellular recordings. By integrating contrastive learning with a denoising autoencoder, HuiduRep learns latent representations that are robust to noise and drift. With HuiduRep, we develop a spike sorting pipeline that clusters spike representations without ground truth labels. Experiments on hybrid and real-world datasets demonstrate that HuiduRep achieves strong robustness. Furthermore, the pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art tools such as KiloSort4 and MountainSort5. These findings demonstrate the potential of self-supervised spike representation learning as a foundational tool for robust and generalizable processing of extracellular recordings.

Title: ICWLM: A Multi-Task Wireless Large Model via In-Context Learning
Authors: Yuxuan Wen, Xiaoming Chen, Maojun Zhang, Zhaohui Yang, Chongwen Huang, Zhaoyang Zhang
Abstract: The rapid evolution of wireless communication technologies, particularly massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) and millimeter-wave (mmWave), introduces significant network complexity and computational demands. Significant research efforts have been made to improve physical layer performance by resorting to deep learning (DL) methods, which, however, are usually task-specific and struggle with data scarcity and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel In-Context Wireless Large Model (ICWLM), a wireless-native foundation model designed for simultaneous multi-task learning at the physical layer. Unlike conventional methods that adapt wireless data to pre-trained large language models (LLMs), ICWLM is trained directly on large-scale, mixed wireless datasets from scratch. It jointly solves multiple classical physical layer problems, including multi-user precoding (sum-rate maximization and max-min SINR) and channel prediction. A key innovation of ICWLM is its utilization of in-context learning (ICL), enabling the model to adapt to varying system configurations and channel conditions with minimal demonstration pairs, eliminating the need for extensive retraining. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that ICWLM achieves competitive performance compared to task-specific methods while exhibiting remarkable generalization capabilities to unseen system configurations. This work offers a promising paradigm for developing unified and adaptive AI models for future wireless networks, potentially reducing deployment complexity and enhancing intelligent resource management.

Title: Distributed Integrated Sensing, Localization, and Communications over LEO Satellite Constellations
Authors: Yuchen Zhang, Francis Soualle, Musa Furkan Keskin, Yuan Liu, Linlong Wu, José A. del Peral-Rosado, Bhavani Shankar M. R., Gonzalo Seco-Granados, Henk Wymeersch, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri
Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations are rapidly becoming essential enablers of next-generation wireless systems, offering global broadband access, high-precision localization, and reliable sensing beyond terrestrial coverage. However, the inherent limitations of individual LEO satellites, including restricted power, limited antenna aperture, and constrained onboard processing, hinder their ability to meet the growing demands of 6G applications. To address these challenges, this article introduces the concept of distributed integrated sensing, localization, and communication (DISLAC) over LEO constellations, inspired by distributed multiple input multiple output architectures. By enabling inter-satellite cooperation through inter-satellite links, DISLAC jointly exploits communication, localization, and sensing functionalities, achieving synergistic gains in throughput, positioning accuracy, and sensing robustness through shared resources and cooperative design. We present illustrative case studies that quantify these benefits and analyze key system-level considerations, including synchronization, antenna reconfigurability, and inter-satellite link design. The article concludes by outlining open research directions to advance the practical deployment of DISLAC in future non-terrestrial networks.

Title: A Convergent Generalized Krylov Subspace Method for Compressed Sensing MRI Reconstruction with Gradient-Driven Denoisers
Authors: Tao Hong, Umberto Villa, Jeffrey A. Fessler
Abstract: Model-based reconstruction plays a key role in compressed sensing (CS) MRI, as it incorporates effective image regularizers to improve the quality of reconstruction. The Plug-and-Play and Regularization-by-Denoising frameworks leverage advanced denoisers (e.g., convolutional neural network (CNN)-based denoisers) and have demonstrated strong empirical performance. However, their theoretical guarantees remain limited, as practical CNNs often violate key assumptions. In contrast, gradient-driven denoisers achieve competitive performance, and the required assumptions for theoretical analysis are easily satisfied. However, solving the associated optimization problem remains computationally demanding. To address this challenge, we propose a generalized Krylov subspace method (GKSM) to solve the optimization problem efficiently. Moreover, we also establish rigorous convergence guarantees for GKSM in nonconvex settings. Numerical experiments on CS MRI reconstruction with spiral and radial acquisitions validate both the computational efficiency of GKSM and the accuracy of the theoretical predictions. The proposed optimization method is applicable to any linear inverse problem.

Title: A Synoptic Review of High-Frequency Oscillations as a Biomarker in Neurodegenerative Disease
Authors: Samin Yaser, Mahad Ali, Yang Jiang, Phuc Nguyen, Jing Xiang, Laura J. Brattain
Abstract: High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs), rapid bursts of brain activity above 80 Hz, have emerged as a highly specific biomarker for epileptogenic tissue. Recent evidence suggests that HFOs are also present in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), reflecting underlying network hyperexcitability and offering a promising, noninvasive tool for early diagnosis and disease tracking. This synoptic review provides a comprehensive analysis of publicly available electroencephalography (EEG) datasets relevant to HFO research in neurodegenerative disorders. We conducted a bibliometric analysis of 1,222 articles, revealing a significant and growing research interest in HFOs, particularly within the last ten years. We then systematically profile and compare key public datasets, evaluating their participant cohorts, data acquisition parameters, and accessibility, with a specific focus on their technical suitability for HFO analysis. Our comparative synthesis highlights critical methodological heterogeneity across datasets, particularly in sampling frequency and recording paradigms, which poses challenges for cross-study validation, but also offers opportunities for robustness testing. By consolidating disparate information, clarifying nomenclature, and providing a detailed methodological framework, this review serves as a guide for researchers aiming to leverage public data to advance the role of HFOs as a cross-disease biomarker for AD and related conditions.

Title: Accelerated Interactive Auralization of Highly Reverberant Spaces using Graphics Hardware
Authors: Hannes Rosseel, Toon van Waterschoot
Abstract: Interactive acoustic auralization allows users to explore virtual acoustic environments in real-time, enabling the acoustic recreation of concert hall or Historical Worship Spaces (HWS) that are either no longer accessible, acoustically altered, or impractical to visit. Interactive acoustic synthesis requires real-time convolution of input signals with a set of synthesis filters that model the space-time acoustic response of the space. The acoustics in concert halls and HWS are both characterized by a long reverberation time, resulting in synthesis filters containing many filter taps. As a result, the convolution process can be computationally demanding, introducing significant latency that limits the real-time interactivity of the auralization system. In this paper, the implementation of a real-time multichannel loudspeaker-based auralization system is presented. This system is capable of synthesizing the acoustics of highly reverberant spaces in real-time using GPU-acceleration. A comparison between traditional CPU-based convolution and GPU-accelerated convolution is presented, showing that the latter can achieve real-time performance with significantly lower latency. Additionally, the system integrates acoustic synthesis with acoustic feedback cancellation on the GPU, creating a unified loudspeaker-based auralization framework that minimizes processing latency.

Title: Near-Real-Time Resource Slicing for QoS Optimization in 5G O-RAN using Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Peihao Yan, Jie Lu, Huacheng Zeng, Y. Thomas Hou
Abstract: Open-Radio Access Network (O-RAN) has become an important paradigm for 5G and beyond radio access networks. This paper presents an xApp called xSlice for the Near-Real-Time (Near-RT) RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) of 5G O-RANs. xSlice is an online learning algorithm that adaptively adjusts MAC-layer resource allocation in response to dynamic network states, including time-varying wireless channel conditions, user mobility, traffic fluctuations, and changes in user demand. To address these network dynamics, we first formulate the Quality-of-Service (QoS) optimization problem as a regret minimization problem by quantifying the QoS demands of all traffic sessions through weighting their throughput, latency, and reliability. We then develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that utilizes an actor-critic model to combine the advantages of both value-based and policy-based updating methods. A graph convolutional network (GCN) is incorporated as a component of the DRL framework for graph embedding of RAN data, enabling xSlice to handle a dynamic number of traffic sessions. We have implemented xSlice on an O-RAN testbed with 10 smartphones and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate its performance in realistic scenarios. Experimental results show that xSlice can reduce performance regret by 67% compared to the state-of-the-art solutions. Source code is available at this https URL.

Title: Word-Level Emotional Expression Control in Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech Synthesis
Authors: Tianrui Wang, Haoyu Wang, Meng Ge, Cheng Gong, Chunyu Qiang, Ziyang Ma, Zikang Huang, Guanrou Yang, Xiaobao Wang, Eng Siong Chng, Xie Chen, Longbiao Wang, Jianwu Dang
Abstract: While emotional text-to-speech (TTS) has made significant progress, most existing research remains limited to utterance-level emotional expression and fails to support word-level control. Achieving word-level expressive control poses fundamental challenges, primarily due to the complexity of modeling multi-emotion transitions and the scarcity of annotated datasets that capture intra-sentence emotional and prosodic variation. In this paper, we propose WeSCon, the first self-training framework that enables word-level control of both emotion and speaking rate in a pretrained zero-shot TTS model, without relying on datasets containing intra-sentence emotion or speed transitions. Our method introduces a transition-smoothing strategy and a dynamic speed control mechanism to guide the pretrained TTS model in performing word-level expressive synthesis through a multi-round inference process. To further simplify the inference, we incorporate a dynamic emotional attention bias mechanism and fine-tune the model via self-training, thereby activating its ability for word-level expressive control in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results show that WeSCon effectively overcomes data scarcity, achieving state-of-the-art performance in word-level emotional expression control while preserving the strong zero-shot synthesis capabilities of the original TTS model.

Title: Privacy-Preserving Distributed Estimation with Limited Data Rate
Authors: Jieming Ke, Jimin Wang, Ji-Feng Zhang
Abstract: This paper focuses on the privacy-preserving distributed estimation problem with a limited data rate, where the observations are the sensitive information. Specifically, a binary-valued quantizer-based privacy-preserving distributed estimation algorithm is developed, which improves the algorithm's privacy-preserving capability and simultaneously reduces the communication costs. The algorithm's privacy-preserving capability, measured by the Fisher information matrix, is dynamically enhanced over time. Notably, the Fisher information matrix of the output signals with respect to the sensitive information converges to zero at a polynomial rate, and the improvement in privacy brought by the quantizers is quantitatively characterized as a multiplicative effect. Regarding the communication costs, each sensor transmits only 1 bit of information to its neighbours at each time step. Additionally, the assumption on the negligible quantization error for real-valued messages is not required. While achieving the requirements of privacy preservation and reducing communication costs, the algorithm ensures that its estimates converge almost surely to the true value of the unknown parameter by establishing a co-design guideline for the time-varying privacy noises and step-sizes. A polynomial almost sure convergence rate is obtained, and then the trade-off between privacy and convergence rate is established. Numerical examples demonstrate the main results.

Title: An Error-Based Safety Buffer for Safe Adaptive Control (Extended Version)
Authors: Peter A. Fisher, Johannes Autenrieb, Anuradha M. Annaswamy
Abstract: We consider the problem of adaptive control of a class of feedback linearizable plants with matched parametric uncertainties whose states are accessible, subject to state constraints, which often arise due to safety considerations. In this paper, we combine adaptation and control barrier functions into a real-time control architecture that guarantees stability, ensures control performance, and remains safe even with the parametric uncertainties. Two problems are considered, differing in the nature of the parametric uncertainties. In both cases, the control barrier function is assumed to have an arbitrary relative degree. In addition to guaranteeing stability, it is proved that both the control objective and safety objective are met with near-zero conservatism. No excitation conditions are imposed on the command signal. Simulation results demonstrate the non-conservatism of all of the theoretical developments.

Title: Competent Discrete Time Modeling For analogue controlled PWM Converter Considering State-Feedback
Authors: Yuxin Yang, Hang Zhou, Hourong Song, Branislav Hredzak, Yingyi Yan
Abstract: Ever since this http URL proposed the state space averaging notion. The small signal model has been widely used as a design tool to tune control parameters. As Moore's law is continuing and the AI chip's high demand for power consumption and dynamic response, the control bandwidth needs to be boosted. However, the average model has two basic assumptions: the low-frequency assumption, the small ripple assumption. In high-bandwidth design, these two assumptions are violated. In order to solve this, various methods have been proposed. This paper gives a comprehensive overview of the existing small signal model for PWM converters from the following perspectives: 1. model fidelity, 2. analytical tractability. 3. complexity of the derivation process and result this http URL.

Title: Fast Collaborative Inference via Distributed Speculative Decoding
Authors: Ce Zheng, Ke Zhang, Chen Sun, Wenqi Zhang, Qiong Liu, Angesom Ataklity Tesfay
Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by allowing a small draft model to predict multiple future tokens for verification by a larger target model. In AI-native radio access networks (AI-RAN), this enables device-edge collaborative inference but introduces significant uplink overhead, as existing distributed speculative decoding schemes transmit full vocabulary logits at every step. We propose a sparsify-then-sample strategy, Truncated Sparse Logits Transmission (TSLT), which transmits only the logits and indices of a truncated candidate set. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the acceptance rate is preserved under TSLT. TSLT is further extended to multi-candidate case, where multiple draft candidates per step increase acceptance probability. Experiments show that TSLT significantly reduces uplink communication while maintaining end-to-end inference latency and model quality, demonstrating its effectiveness for scalable, communication-efficient distributed LLM inference in future AI-RAN systems.

Title: Co-Existence of Private 5G Network and Wireless Hospital Systems
Authors: Mohsin Iqbal Khan, Matti Hämäläinen, Timo J. Mäkelä, Erkki Harjula, Jani Katisko
Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of deploying private 5G networks in hospital environments, with a focus on the operating room at the brand new Oulu University Hospital, Finland. The study aims to evaluate the interference risk with other wireless systems, and electromagnetic safety of a private 5G network in the 3.9-4.1 GHz band, while ensuring compatibility with legacy wireless systems, such as LTE and Wi-Fi. We conducted a measurement campaign, employing state-of-the-art instrumentation and a methodology that combined high resolution and long-duration spectrum scans. The results demonstrate no measurable interference between the hospital's private 5G network with adjacent LTE (4G) or Wi-Fi bands, confirming the spectral isolation of the 5G transmissions, and vise versa. Additionally, RF exposure levels in the operating room were found to be well below ICNIRP, WHO, and IEEE safety thresholds, ensuring that the network poses negligible biological risk to patients and hospital staff. The study also proposes spectrum management strategies for private 5G networks in hospitals, focusing on adaptive sensing and guardband planning. These findings provide a solid foundation for the integration of private 5G infrastructure in hospitals environments, supporting digital transformation in patient care without compromising electromagnetic compatibility or patient safety. The results also contribute to ongoing discussions around private 5G network deployments in sensitive sectors and provide actionable guidelines for future hospitals' wireless systems planning.

Title: Speak the Art: A Direct Speech to Image Generation Framework
Authors: Mariam Saeed, Manar Amr, Farida Adel, Nada Hassan, Nour Walid, Eman Mohamed, Mohamed Hussein, Marwan Torki
Abstract: Direct speech-to-image generation has recently shown promising results. However, compared to text-to-image generation, there is still a large gap to enclose. Current approaches use two stages to tackle this task: speech encoding network and image generative adversarial network (GAN). The speech encoding networks in these approaches produce embeddings that do not capture sufficient linguistic information to semantically represent the input speech. GANs suffer from issues such as non-convergence, mode collapse, and diminished gradient, which result in unstable model parameters, limited sample diversity, and ineffective generator learning, respectively. To address these weaknesses, we introduce a framework called Speak the Art (STA) which consists of a speech encoding network and a VQ-Diffusion network conditioned on speech embeddings. To improve speech embeddings, the speech encoding network is supervised by a large pre-trained image-text model during training. Replacing GANs with diffusion leads to more stable training and the generation of diverse images. Additionally, we investigate the feasibility of extending our framework to be multilingual. As a proof of concept, we trained our framework with two languages: English and Arabic. Finally, we show that our results surpass state-of-the-art models by a large margin.

Title: Beyond Path Loss: Altitude-Dependent Spectral Structure Modeling for UAV Measurements
Authors: Amir Hossein Fahim Raouf, İsmail Güvenç
Abstract: This paper presents a measurement-based framework for characterizing altitude-dependent spectral behavior of signals received by a tethered Helikite unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Using a multi-year spectrum measurement campaign in an outdoor urban environment, power spectral density snapshots are collected over the 89 MHz--6 GHz range. Three altitude-dependent spectral metrics are extracted: band-average power, spectral entropy, and spectral sparsity. We introduce the Altitude-Dependent Spectral Structure Model (ADSSM) to characterize the spectral power and entropy using first-order altitude-domain differential equations, and spectral sparsity using a logistic function, yielding closed-form expressions with physically consistent asymptotic behavior. The model is fitted to altitude-binned measurements from three annual campaigns at the AERPAW testbed across six licensed and unlicensed sub-6 GHz bands. Across all bands and years, the ADSSM achieves low root-mean-square error and high coefficients of determination. Results indicate that power transitions occur over narrow low-altitude regions, while entropy and sparsity evolve over broader, band-dependent altitude ranges, demonstrating that altitude-dependent spectrum behavior is inherently multidimensional. By explicitly modeling altitude-dependent transitions in spectral structure beyond received power, the proposed framework enables spectrum-aware UAV sensing and band selection decisions that are not achievable with conventional power- or threshold-based occupancy models.

Title: Modeling and Control for UAV with Off-center Slung Load
Authors: Zongyang Lv, Yanmei Jia, Yongqing Liu, Alan F. Lynch, Qing Zhao, Yuhu Wu
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with slung load system is a classic air transportation system. In practical applications, the suspension point of the slung load does not always align with the center of mass (CoM) of the UAV due to mission requirements or mechanical interference. This offset creates coupling in the system's nonlinear dynamics which leads to a complicated motion control problem. In existing research, modeling of the system are performed about the UAV's CoM. In this work we use the point of suspension instead. Based on the new model, a cascade control strategy is developed. In the middle-loop controller, the acceleration of the suspension point is used to regulate the swing angle of the slung load without the need for considering the coupling between the slung load and the UAV. An inner-loop controller is designed to track the UAV's attitude without the need of simplification on the coupling effects. We prove local exponential stability of the closed-loop using Lyapunov approach. Finally, simulations and experiments are conducted to validate the proposed control system.

Title: On the Impact of Channel Aging and Doppler-Affected Clutter on OFDM ISAC Systems
Authors: Steven Rivetti, Gabor Fodor, Emil Björnson, Mikael Skoglund
Abstract: The temporal evolution of the propagation environment plays a central role in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. A slow-time evolution manifests as channel aging in communication links, while a fast-time one is associated with structured clutter with non-zero Doppler. Nevertheless, the joint impact of these two phenomena on ISAC performance has been largely overlooked. This addresses this research gap in a network utilizing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing waveforms. Here, a base station simultaneously serves multiple user equipment (UE) devices and performs monostatic sensing. Channel aging is captured through an autoregressive model with exponential correlation decay. In contrast, clutter is modeled as a collection of uncorrelated, coherent patches with non-zero Doppler, resulting in a Kronecker-separable covariance structure. We propose an aging-aware channel estimator that uses prior pilot observations to estimate the time-varying UE channels, characterized by a non-isotropic multipath fading structure. The clutter's structure enables a novel low-complexity sensing pipeline: clutter statistics are estimated from raw data and subsequently used to suppress the clutter's action, after which target parameters are extracted through range-angle and range-velocity maps. We evaluate the influence of frame length and pilot history on channel estimation accuracy and demonstrate substantial performance gains over block fading in low-to-moderate mobility regimes. The sensing pipeline is implemented in a clutter-dominated environment, demonstrating that effective clutter suppression can be achieved under practical configurations. Furthermore, our results show that dedicated sensing streams are required, as communication beams provide insufficient range resolution.

Title: A Comprehensive Study on the Effectiveness of ASR Representations for Noise-Robust Speech Emotion Recognition
Authors: Xiaohan Shi, Jiajun He, Xingfeng Li, Tomoki Toda
Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient attempt to noisy speech emotion recognition (NSER). Conventional NSER approaches have proven effective in mitigating the impact of artificial noise sources, such as white Gaussian noise, but are limited to non-stationary noises in real-world environments due to their complexity and uncertainty. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new method for NSER by adopting the automatic speech recognition (ASR) model as a noise-robust feature extractor to eliminate non-vocal information in noisy speech. We first obtain intermediate layer information from the ASR model as a feature representation for emotional speech and then apply this representation for the downstream NSER task. Our experimental results show that 1) the proposed method achieves better NSER performance compared with the conventional noise reduction method, 2) outperforms self-supervised learning approaches, and 3) even outperforms text-based approaches using ASR transcription or the ground truth transcription of noisy speech.

Title: A Concentration Bound for TD(0) with Function Approximation
Authors: Siddharth Chandak, Vivek S. Borkar
Abstract: We derive uniform all-time concentration bound of the type 'for all $n \geq n_0$ for some $n_0$' for TD(0) with linear function approximation. We work with online TD learning with samples from a single sample path of the underlying Markov chain. This makes our analysis significantly different from offline TD learning or TD learning with access to independent samples from the stationary distribution of the Markov chain. We treat TD(0) as a contractive stochastic approximation algorithm, with both martingale and Markov noises. Markov noise is handled using the Poisson equation and the lack of almost sure guarantees on boundedness of iterates is handled using the concept of relaxed concentration inequalities.

Title: Neuromorphic Photonic Computing with an Electro-Optic Analog Memory
Authors: Sean Lam, Ahmed Khaled, Simon Bilodeau, Bicky A. Marquez, Paul R. Prucnal, Lukas Chrostowski, Bhavin J. Shastri, Sudip Shekhar
Abstract: In neuromorphic photonic systems, device operations are typically governed by analog signals, necessitating digital-to-analog converters (DAC) and analog-to-digital converters (ADC). However, data movement between memory and these converters in conventional von Neumann architectures incur significant energy costs. We propose an analog electronic memory co-located with photonic computing units to eliminate repeated long-distance data movement. Here, we demonstrate a monolithically integrated neuromorphic photonic circuit with on-chip capacitive analog memory and evaluate its performance in machine learning for in situ training and inference using the MNIST dataset. Our analysis shows that integrating analog memory into a neuromorphic photonic architecture can achieve over 26x power savings compared to conventional SRAM-DAC architectures. Furthermore, maintaining a minimum analog memory retention-to-network-latency ratio of 100 maintains >90% inference accuracy, enabling leaky analog memories without substantial performance degradation. This approach reduces reliance on DACs, minimizes data movement, and offers a scalable pathway toward energy-efficient, high-speed neuromorphic photonic computing.

Title: Backpropagation through space, time, and the brain
Authors: Benjamin Ellenberger, Paul Haider, Jakob Jordan, Kevin Max, Ismael Jaras, Laura Kriener, Federico Benitez, Mihai A. Petrovici
Abstract: How physical networks of neurons, bound by spatio-temporal locality constraints, can perform efficient credit assignment, remains, to a large extent, an open question. In machine learning, the answer is almost universally given by the error backpropagation algorithm, through both space and time. However, this algorithm is well-known to rely on biologically implausible assumptions, in particular with respect to spatio-temporal (non-)locality. Alternative forward-propagation models such as real-time recurrent learning only partially solve the locality problem, but only at the cost of scaling, due to prohibitive storage requirements. We introduce Generalized Latent Equilibrium (GLE), a computational framework for fully local spatio-temporal credit assignment in physical, dynamical networks of neurons. We start by defining an energy based on neuron-local mismatches, from which we derive both neuronal dynamics via stationarity and parameter dynamics via gradient descent. The resulting dynamics can be interpreted as a real-time, biologically plausible approximation of backpropagation through space and time in deep cortical networks with continuous-time neuronal dynamics and continuously active, local synaptic plasticity. In particular, GLE exploits the morphology of dendritic trees to enable more complex information storage and processing in single neurons, as well as the ability of biological neurons to phase-shift their output rate with respect to their membrane potential, which is essential in both directions of information propagation. For the forward computation, it enables the mapping of time-continuous inputs to neuronal space, effectively performing a spatio-temporal convolution. For the backward computation, it permits the temporal inversion of feedback signals, which consequently approximate the adjoint variables necessary for useful parameter updates.

Title: Finite-Time Analysis of Simultaneous Double Q-learning
Authors: Hyunjun Na, Donghwan Lee
Abstract: $Q$-learning is one of the most fundamental reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Despite its widespread success in various applications, it is prone to overestimation bias in the $Q$-learning update. To address this issue, double $Q$-learning employs two independent $Q$-estimators which are randomly selected and updated during the learning process. This paper proposes a modified double $Q$-learning, called simultaneous double $Q$-learning (SDQ), with its finite-time analysis. SDQ eliminates the need for random selection between the two $Q$-estimators, and this modification allows us to analyze double $Q$-learning through the lens of a novel switching system framework facilitating efficient finite-time analysis. Empirical studies demonstrate that SDQ converges faster than double $Q$-learning while retaining the ability to mitigate the maximization bias. Finally, we derive a finite-time expected error bound for SDQ.

Title: SpectralKAN: Weighted Activation Distribution Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Hyperspectral Image Change Detection
Authors: Yanheng Wang, Xiaohan Yu, Yongsheng Gao, Jianjun Sha, Jian Wang, Shiyong Yan, Kai Qin, Yonggang Zhang, Lianru Gao
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) represent data features by learning the activation functions and demonstrate superior accuracy with fewer parameters, FLOPs, GPU memory usage (Memory), shorter training time (TraT), and testing time (TesT) when handling low-dimensional data. However, when applied to high-dimensional data, which contains significant redundant information, the current activation mechanism of KANs leads to unnecessary computations, thereby reducing computational efficiency. KANs require reshaping high-dimensional data into a one-dimensional tensor as input, which inevitably results in the loss of dimensional information. To address these limitations, we propose weighted activation distribution KANs (WKANs), which reduce the frequency of activations per node and distribute node information into different output nodes through weights to avoid extracting redundant information. Furthermore, we introduce a multilevel tensor splitting framework (MTSF), which decomposes high-dimensional data to extract features from each dimension independently and leverages tensor-parallel computation to significantly improve the computational efficiency of WKANs on high-dimensional data. In this paper, we design SpectralKAN for hyperspectral image change detection using the proposed MTSF. SpectralKAN demonstrates outstanding performance across five datasets, achieving an overall accuracy (OA) of 0.9801 and a Kappa coefficient (K) of 0.9514 on the Farmland dataset, with only 8 k parameters, 0.07 M FLOPs, 911 MB Memory, 13.26 S TraT, and 2.52 S TesT, underscoring its superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

Title: TLRN: Temporal Latent Residual Networks For Large Deformation Image Registration
Authors: Nian Wu, Jiarui Xing, Miaomiao Zhang
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach, termed {\em Temporal Latent Residual Network (TLRN)}, to predict a sequence of deformation fields in time-series image registration. The challenge of registering time-series images often lies in the occurrence of large motions, especially when images differ significantly from a reference (e.g., the start of a cardiac cycle compared to the peak stretching phase). To achieve accurate and robust registration results, we leverage the nature of motion continuity and exploit the temporal smoothness in consecutive image frames. Our proposed TLRN highlights a temporal residual network with residual blocks carefully designed in latent deformation spaces, which are parameterized by time-sequential initial velocity fields. We treat a sequence of residual blocks over time as a dynamic training system, where each block is designed to learn the residual function between desired deformation features and current input accumulated from previous time frames. We validate the effectivenss of TLRN on both synthetic data and real-world cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image videos. Our experimental results shows that TLRN is able to achieve substantially improved registration accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art. Our code is publicly available at this https URL.

Title: SIGNL: A Label-Efficient Audio Deepfake Detection System via Spectral-Temporal Graph Non-Contrastive Learning
Authors: Falih Gozi Febrinanto, Kristen Moore, Chandra Thapa, Jiangang Ma, Vidya Saikrishna
Abstract: Audio deepfake detection is increasingly important as synthetic speech becomes more realistic and accessible. Recent methods, including those using graph neural networks (GNNs) to model frequency and temporal dependencies, show strong potential but need large amounts of labeled data, which limits their practical use. Label-efficient alternatives like graph-based non-contrastive learning offer a potential solution, as they can learn useful representations from unlabeled data without using negative samples. However, current graph non-contrastive approaches are built for single-view graph representations and cannot be directly used for audio, which has unique spectral and temporal structures. Bridging this gap requires dual-view graph modeling suited to audio signals. In this work, we introduce SIGNL (Spectral-temporal vIsion Graph Non-contrastive Learning), a label-efficient expert system for detecting audio deepfakes. SIGNL operates on the visual representation of audio, such as spectrograms or other time-frequency encodings, transforming them into spectral and temporal graphs for structured feature extraction. It then employs graph convolutional encoders to learn complementary frequency-time features, effectively capturing the unique characteristics of audio. These encoders are pre-trained using a non-contrastive self-supervised learning strategy on augmented graph pairs, enabling effective representation learning without labeled data. The resulting encoders are then fine-tuned on minimal labelled data for downstream deepfake detection. SIGNL achieves strong performance on multiple audio deepfake detection benchmarks, including 7.88% EER on ASVspoof 2021 DF and 3.95% EER on ASVspoof 5 using only 5% labeled data. It also generalizes well to unseen conditions, reaching 10.16% EER on the In-The-Wild dataset when trained on CFAD.

Title: Jailbreak-AudioBench: In-Depth Evaluation and Analysis of Jailbreak Threats for Large Audio Language Models
Authors: Hao Cheng, Erjia Xiao, Jing Shao, Yichi Wang, Le Yang, Chao Shen, Philip Torr, Jindong Gu, Renjing Xu
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. Integrating various modality encoders further expands their capabilities, giving rise to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that process not only text but also visual and auditory modality inputs. However, these advanced capabilities may also pose significant safety problems, as models can be exploited to generate harmful or inappropriate content through jailbreak attacks. While prior work has extensively explored how manipulating textual or visual modality inputs can circumvent safeguards in LLMs and MLLMs, the vulnerability of audio-specific jailbreak on Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce Jailbreak-AudioBench, which consists of the Toolbox, curated Dataset, and comprehensive Benchmark. The Toolbox supports not only text-to-audio conversion but also various editing techniques for injecting audio hidden semantics. The curated Dataset provides diverse explicit and implicit jailbreak audio examples in both original and edited forms. Utilizing this dataset, we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LALMs and establish the most comprehensive Jailbreak benchmark to date for audio modality. Finally, Jailbreak-AudioBench establishes a foundation for advancing future research on LALMs safety alignment by enabling the in-depth exposure of more powerful jailbreak threats, such as query-based audio editing, and by facilitating the development of effective defense mechanisms.

Title: Surface-Based Manipulation with Modular Foldable Robots
Authors: Ziqiao Wang, Serhat Demirtas, Fabio Zuliani, Jamie Paik
Abstract: Intelligence lies not only in the brain (decision-making processes) but in the body (physical morphology). The morphology of robots can significantly influence how they interact with the physical world, crucial for manipulating objects in real-life scenarios. Conventional robotic manipulation strategies mainly rely on finger-shaped end effectors. However, achieving stable grasps on fragile, deformable, irregularly shaped, or slippery objects is challenging due to difficulty in establishing stable forces or geometric constraints. Here, we present surface-based manipulation strategies that diverge from classical grasping approaches, using flat surfaces as minimalist end-effectors. By adjusting surfaces' position and orientation, objects can be translated, rotated, and flipped across the surface using closed-loop control strategies. Since this method does not rely on stable grasping, it can adapt to objects of various shapes, sizes, and stiffness levels and can even manipulate the shape of deformable objects. Our results provide a new perspective for solving complex manipulation problems.

Title: Certifying Stability of Reinforcement Learning Policies using Generalized Lyapunov Functions
Authors: Kehan Long, Jorge Cortés, Nikolay Atanasov
Abstract: Establishing stability certificates for closed-loop systems under reinforcement learning (RL) policies is essential to move beyond empirical performance and offer guarantees of system behavior. Classical Lyapunov methods require a strict stepwise decrease in the Lyapunov function but such certificates are difficult to construct for learned policies. The RL value function is a natural candidate but it is not well understood how it can be adapted for this purpose. To gain intuition, we first study the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem and make two key observations. First, a Lyapunov function can be obtained from the value function of an LQR policy by augmenting it with a residual term related to the system dynamics and stage cost. Second, the classical Lyapunov decrease requirement can be relaxed to a generalized Lyapunov condition requiring only decrease on average over multiple time steps. Using this intuition, we consider the nonlinear setting and formulate an approach to learn generalized Lyapunov functions by augmenting RL value functions with neural network residual terms. Our approach successfully certifies the stability of RL policies trained on Gymnasium and DeepMind Control benchmarks. We also extend our method to jointly train neural controllers and stability certificates using a multi-step Lyapunov loss, resulting in larger certified inner approximations of the region of attraction compared to the classical Lyapunov approach. Overall, our formulation enables stability certification for a broad class of systems with learned policies by making certificates easier to construct, thereby bridging classical control theory and modern learning-based methods.

Title: Benchmarking Spatiotemporal Reasoning in LLMs and Reasoning Models: Capabilities and Challenges
Authors: Pengrui Quan, Brian Wang, Kang Yang, Liying Han, Mani Srivastava
Abstract: Spatiotemporal reasoning plays a key role in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Despite advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), their capacity to reason about complex spatiotemporal signals remains underexplored. This paper proposes a hierarchical SpatioTemporal reAsoning benchmaRK, STARK, to systematically evaluate LLMs across three levels of reasoning complexity: state estimation (e.g., predicting field variables, localizing and tracking events in space and time), spatiotemporal reasoning over states (e.g., inferring spatial-temporal relationships), and world-knowledge-aware reasoning that integrates contextual and domain knowledge (e.g., intent prediction, landmark-aware navigation). We curate 26 distinct spatiotemporal tasks with diverse sensor modalities, comprising 14,552 challenges where models answer directly or by Python Code Interpreter. Evaluating 3 LRMs and 8 LLMs, we find LLMs achieve limited success in tasks requiring geometric reasoning (e.g., multilateration or triangulation), particularly as complexity increases. Surprisingly, LRMs show robust performance across tasks with various levels of difficulty, often competing or surpassing traditional first-principle-based methods. Our results show that in reasoning tasks requiring world knowledge, the performance gap between LLMs and LRMs narrows, with some LLMs even surpassing LRMs. However, the LRM o3 model continues to achieve leading performance across all evaluated tasks, a result attributed primarily to the larger size of the reasoning models. STARK motivates future innovations in model architectures and reasoning paradigms for intelligent CPS by providing a structured framework to identify limitations in the spatiotemporal reasoning of LLMs and LRMs.

Title: Confidence-Based Self-Training for EMG-to-Speech: Leveraging Synthetic EMG for Robust Modeling
Authors: Xiaodan Chen, Xiaoxue Gao, Mathias Quoy, Alexandre Pitti, Nancy F.Chen
Abstract: Voiced Electromyography (EMG)-to-Speech (V-ETS) models reconstruct speech from muscle activity signals, facilitating applications such as neurolaryngologic diagnostics. Despite its potential, the advancement of V-ETS is hindered by a scarcity of paired EMG-speech data. To address this, we propose a novel Confidence-based Multi-Speaker Self-training (CoM2S) approach, along with a newly curated Libri-EMG dataset. This approach leverages synthetic EMG data generated by a pre-trained model, followed by a proposed filtering mechanism based on phoneme-level confidence to enhance the ETS model through the proposed self-training techniques. Experiments demonstrate our method improves phoneme accuracy, reduces phonological confusion, and lowers word error rate, confirming the effectiveness of our CoM2S approach for V-ETS. In support of future research, we will release the codes and the proposed Libri-EMG dataset-an open-access, time-aligned, multi-speaker voiced EMG and speech recordings.

Title: Out-of-Distribution Semantic Occupancy Prediction
Authors: Yuheng Zhang, Mengfei Duan, Kunyu Peng, Yuhang Wang, Ruiping Liu, Fei Teng, Kai Luo, Zhiyong Li, Kailun Yang
Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, providing a dense, semantically rich environmental representation. However, existing methods focus on in-distribution scenes, making them susceptible to Out-of-Distribution (OoD) objects and long-tail distributions, which increases the risk of undetected anomalies and misinterpretations, posing safety hazards. To address these challenges, we introduce Out-of-Distribution Semantic Occupancy Prediction, targeting OoD detection in 3D voxel space. To fill dataset gaps, we propose a Realistic Anomaly Augmentation that injects synthetic anomalies while preserving realistic spatial and occlusion patterns, enabling the creation of two datasets: VAA-KITTI and VAA-KITTI-360. Then, a novel framework that integrates OoD detection into 3D semantic occupancy prediction, OccOoD, is proposed, which uses Cross-Space Semantic Refinement (CSSR) to refine semantic predictions from complementary voxel and BEV representations, improving OoD detection. Experimental results demonstrate that OccOoD achieves state-of-the-art OoD detection with an AuROC of 65.50% and an AuPRCr of 31.83 within a 1.2m region, while maintaining competitive semantic occupancy prediction performance and generalization in real-world urban driving scenes. The established datasets and source code will be made publicly available at this https URL.

Title: TELEVAL: A Dynamic Benchmark Designed for Spoken Language Models in Chinese Interactive Scenarios
Authors: Zehan Li, Hongjie Chen, Qing Wang, Yuxin Zhang, Jing Zhou, Hang Lv, Mengjie Du, Yaodong Song, Jie Lian, Jian Kang, Jie Li, Yongxiang Li, Xuelong Li
Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, accompanied by a growing number of evaluation benchmarks. However, most existing benchmarks emphasize task completion and capability scaling, while remaining poorly aligned with how users interact with SLMs in real-world spoken conversations. Effective spoken interaction requires not only accurate understanding of user intent and content, but also the ability to respond with appropriate interactional strategies. In this paper, we present TELEVAL, a dynamic, user-centered benchmark for evaluating SLMs in realistic Chinese spoken interaction scenarios. TELEVAL consolidates evaluation into two core aspects. Reliable Content Fulfillment assesses whether models can comprehend spoken inputs and produce semantically correct responses. Interactional Appropriateness evaluates whether models act as socially capable interlocutors, requiring them not only to generate human-like, colloquial responses, but also to implicitly incorporate paralinguistic cues for natural interaction. Experiments reveal that, despite strong performance on semantic and knowledge-oriented tasks, current SLMs still struggle to produce natural and interactionally appropriate responses, highlighting the need for more interaction-faithful evaluation.

Title: A dataset and model for auditory scene recognition for hearing devices: AHEAD-DS and OpenYAMNet
Authors: Henry Zhong, Jörg M. Buchholz, Julian Maclaren, Simon Carlile, Richard Lyon
Abstract: Scene recognition is important for hearing devices, however; this is challenging, in part because of the limitations of existing datasets. Datasets often lack public accessibility, completeness, or audiologically relevant labels, hindering systematic comparison of machine learning models. Deploying such models on resource-constrained edge devices presents another this http URL proposed solution is two-fold, a repack and refinement of several open source datasets to create AHEAD-DS, a dataset designed for auditory scene recognition for hearing devices, and introduce OpenYAMNet, a sound recognition model. AHEAD-DS aims to provide a standardised, publicly available dataset with consistent labels relevant to hearing aids, facilitating model comparison. OpenYAMNet is designed for deployment on edge devices like smartphones connected to hearing devices, such as hearing aids and wireless earphones with hearing aid functionality, serving as a baseline model for sound-based scene recognition. OpenYAMNet achieved a mean average precision of 0.86 and accuracy of 0.93 on the testing set of AHEAD-DS across fourteen categories relevant to auditory scene recognition. Real-time sound-based scene recognition capabilities were demonstrated on edge devices by deploying OpenYAMNet to an Android smartphone. Even with a 2018 Google Pixel 3, a phone with modest specifications, the model processes audio with approximately 50ms of latency to load the model, and an approximate linear increase of 30ms per 1 second of audio.

Title: Metaplectic time-frequency representations
Authors: Gianluca Giacchi
Abstract: Time-frequency representations stemmed in 1932 with the introduction of the Wigner distribution. For most of the 20th century, research in this area primarily focused on defining joint probability distributions for position and momentum in quantum mechanics. Applications to electrical engineering were soon established with the seminal works of Gabor and the researchers at Bell Labs. In 2012, Bai, Li and Cheng used for the first time metaplectic operators, defined in the middle of 20th century by Van Hove, to generalize the Wigner distribution and unify effectively the most used time-frequency representations under a common framework. This work serves as a comprehensive up-to-date survey on time-frequency representations defined by means of metaplectic operators, with particular emphasis on the recent contributions by Cordero and Rodino, who exploited metaplectic operators to their limits to generalize the Wigner distributions. Their idea provides a fruitful framework where properties of time-frequency representations can be explained naturally by the structure of the symplectic group.

Title: Neighborhood Feature Pooling for Remote Sensing Image Classification
Authors: Fahimeh Orvati Nia, Amirmohammad Mohammadi, Salim Al Kharsa, Pragati Naikare, Zigfried Hampel-Arias, Joshua Peeples
Abstract: In this work, we introduce Neighborhood Feature Pooling (NFP), a novel pooling layer designed to enhance texture-aware representation learning for remote sensing image classification. The proposed NFP layer captures relationships between neighboring spatial features by aggregating local similarity patterns across feature dimensions. Implemented using standard convolutional operations, NFP can be seamlessly integrated into existing neural network architectures with minimal additional parameters. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets and backbone models demonstrate that NFP consistently improves classification performance compared to conventional pooling strategies, while maintaining computational efficiency. These results highlight the effectiveness of neighborhood-based feature aggregation for capturing discriminative texture information in remote sensing imagery.

Title: REXO: Indoor Multi-View Radar Object Detection via 3D Bounding Box Diffusion
Authors: Ryoma Yataka, Pu Perry Wang, Petros Boufounos, Ryuhei Takahashi
Abstract: Multi-view indoor radar perception has drawn attention due to its cost-effectiveness and low privacy risks. Existing methods often rely on {implicit} cross-view radar feature association, such as proposal pairing in RFMask or query-to-feature cross-attention in RETR, which can lead to ambiguous feature matches and degraded detection in complex indoor scenes. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{REXO} (multi-view Radar object dEtection with 3D bounding boX diffusiOn), which lifts the 2D bounding box (BBox) diffusion process of DiffusionDet into the 3D radar space. REXO utilizes these noisy 3D BBoxes to guide an {explicit} cross-view radar feature association, enhancing the cross-view radar-conditioned denoising process. By accounting for prior knowledge that the person is in contact with the ground, REXO reduces the number of diffusion parameters by determining them from this prior. Evaluated on two open indoor radar datasets, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods by a margin of +4.22 AP on the HIBER dataset and +11.02 AP on the MMVR dataset. The REXO implementation is available at this https URL.

Title: AgriLiRa4D: A Multi-Sensor UAV Dataset for Robust SLAM in Challenging Agricultural Fields
Authors: Zhihao Zhan, Yuhang Ming, Shaobin Li, Jie Yuan
Abstract: Multi-sensor Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is essential for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) performing agricultural tasks such as spraying, surveying, and inspection. However, real-world, multi-modal agricultural UAV datasets that enable research on robust operation remain scarce. To address this gap, we present AgriLiRa4D, a multi-modal UAV dataset designed for challenging outdoor agricultural environments. AgriLiRa4D spans three representative farmland types-flat, hilly, and terraced-and includes both boundary and coverage operation modes, resulting in six flight sequence groups. The dataset provides high-accuracy ground-truth trajectories from a Fiber Optic Inertial Navigation System with Real-Time Kinematic capability (FINS_RTK), along with synchronized measurements from a 3D LiDAR, a 4D Radar, and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), accompanied by complete intrinsic and extrinsic calibrations. Leveraging its comprehensive sensor suite and diverse real-world scenarios, AgriLiRa4D supports diverse SLAM and localization studies and enables rigorous robustness evaluation against low-texture crops, repetitive patterns, dynamic vegetation, and other challenges of real agricultural environments. To further demonstrate its utility, we benchmark four state-of-the-art multi-sensor SLAM algorithms across different sensor combinations, highlighting the difficulty of the proposed sequences and the necessity of multi-modal approaches for reliable UAV localization. By filling a critical gap in agricultural SLAM datasets, AgriLiRa4D provides a valuable benchmark for the research community and contributes to advancing autonomous navigation technologies for agricultural UAVs.

Title: PADE: A Predictor-Free Sparse Attention Accelerator via Unified Execution and Stage Fusion
Authors: Huizheng Wang, Hongbin Wang, Zichuan Wang, Zhiheng Yue, Yang Wang, Chao Li, Yang Hu, Shouyi Yin
Abstract: Attention-based models have revolutionized AI, but the quadratic cost of self-attention incurs severe computational and memory overhead. Sparse attention methods alleviate this by skipping low-relevance token pairs. However, current approaches lack practicality due to the heavy expense of added sparsity predictor, which severely drops their hardware efficiency. This paper advances the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by proposing a bit-serial enable stage-fusion (BSF) mechanism, which eliminates the need for a separate predictor. However, it faces key challenges: 1) Inaccurate bit-sliced sparsity speculation leads to incorrect pruning; 2) Hardware under-utilization due to fine-grained and imbalanced bit-level workloads. 3) Tiling difficulty caused by the row-wise dependency in sparsity pruning criteria. We propose PADE, a predictor-free algorithm-hardware co-design for dynamic sparse attention acceleration. PADE features three key innovations: 1) Bit-wise uncertainty interval-enabled guard filtering (BUI-GF) strategy to accurately identify trivial tokens during each bit round; 2) Bidirectional sparsity-based out-of-order execution (BS-OOE) to improve hardware utilization; 3) Interleaving-based sparsity-tiled attention (ISTA) to reduce both I/O and computational complexity. These techniques, combined with custom accelerator designs, enable practical sparsity acceleration without relying on an added sparsity predictor. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks show that PADE achieves 7.43x speed up and 31.1x higher energy efficiency than Nvidia H100 GPU. Compared to SOTA accelerators, PADE achieves 5.1x, 4.3x and 3.4x energy saving than Sanger, DOTA and SOFA.

Title: Sketch&Patch++: Efficient Structure-Aware 3D Gaussian Representation
Authors: Yuang Shi, Géraldine Morin, Simone Gasparini, Wei Tsang Ooi
Abstract: We observe that Gaussians exhibit distinct roles and characteristics analogous to traditional artistic techniques -- like how artists first sketch outlines before filling in broader areas with color, some Gaussians capture high-frequency features such as edges and contours, while others represent broader, smoother regions analogous to brush strokes that add volume and depth. Based on this observation, we propose a hybrid representation that categorizes Gaussians into (i) Sketch Gaussians, which represent high-frequency, boundary-defining features, and (ii) Patch Gaussians, which cover low-frequency, smooth regions. This semantic separation naturally enables layered progressive streaming, where the compact Sketch Gaussians establish the structural skeleton before Patch Gaussians incrementally refine volumetric detail. In this work, we extend our previous method to arbitrary 3D scenes by proposing a novel hierarchical adaptive categorization framework that operates directly on the 3DGS representation. Our approach employs multi-criteria density-based clustering, combined with adaptive quality-driven refinement. This method eliminates dependency on external 3D line primitives while ensuring optimal parametric encoding effectiveness. Our comprehensive evaluation across diverse scenes, including both man-made and natural environments, demonstrates that our method achieves up to 1.74 dB improvement in PSNR, 6.7% in SSIM, and 41.4% in LPIPS at equivalent model sizes compared to uniform pruning baselines. For indoor scenes, our method can maintain visual quality with only 0.5\% of the original model size. This structure-aware representation enables efficient storage, adaptive streaming, and rendering of high-fidelity 3D content across bandwidth-constrained networks and resource-limited devices.
