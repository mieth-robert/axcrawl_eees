Authors: Djamila Rekioua (LTII), Saloua Belaid (LTII), Pierre-Olivier Logerais (CERTES EA 3481), Toufik Rekioua (LTII), Zahra Mokrani (LTII), Khoudir Kakouche (LTII), Adel Oubelaid (LTII), Faika Zaouche (LTII)
Abstract: Our paper is focused on optimal and control of an isolated photovoltaic system with batteries. The control is made by the application of a power management control (PMC). Batteries are kept safe from deep discharges and overloads by the PMC, maintaining a continuous supply to the load. The ease, with which this method can be implemented, as well as its effectiveness without imposing a large computing strain on the user, is noteworthy. The batteries and PV panels in the system under study are connected to a bidirectional converter enabling the batteries to be charged and drained in accordance with weather conditions. The simulation results, clearly highlight good performance of the proposed control across two different profiles.

Title: Optimized Renewable Energy Planning MDP for Socially-Equitable Electricity Coverage in the US
Authors: Riya Kinnarkar, Mansur Arief
Abstract: Traditional power grid infrastructure presents significant barriers to renewable energy integration and perpetuates energy access inequities, with low-income communities experiencing disproportionately longer power outages. This study develops a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to optimize renewable energy allocation while explicitly addressing social equity concerns in electricity distribution. The model incorporates budget constraints, energy demand variability, and social vulnerability indicators across eight major U.S. cities to evaluate policy alternatives for equitable clean energy transitions. Numerical experiments compare the MDP-based approach against baseline policies including random allocation, greedy renewable expansion, and expert heuristics. Results demonstrate that equity-focused optimization can achieve 32.9% renewable energy penetration while reducing underserved low-income populations by 55% compared to conventional approaches. The expert policy achieved the highest reward, while the Monte Carlo Tree Search baseline provided competitive performance with significantly lower budget utilization, demonstrating that fair distribution of clean energy resources is achievable without sacrificing overall system performance and providing ways for integrating social equity considerations with climate goals and inclusive access to clean power infrastructure.

Title: Exploring the Efficacy of Convolutional Neural Networks in Sleep Apnea Detection from Single Channel EEG
Authors: Chun Hin Siu, Hossein Miri
Abstract: Sleep apnea, a prevalent sleep disorder, involves repeated episodes of breathing interruptions during sleep, leading to various health complications, including cognitive impairments, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and even death. One of the main challenges in diagnosing and treating sleep apnea is identifying individuals at risk. The current gold standard for diagnosis, Polysomnography (PSG), is costly, labor intensive, and inconvenient, often resulting in poor quality sleep data. This paper presents a novel approach to the detection of sleep apnea using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on single channel EEG data. The proposed CNN achieved an accuracy of 85.1% and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.22, demonstrating a significant potential for home based applications by addressing the limitations of PSG in automated sleep apnea detection. Key contributions of this work also include the development of a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline with an Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) Butterworth filter, a dataset construction method providing broader temporal context, and the application of SMOTETomek to address class imbalance. This research underscores the feasibility of transitioning from traditional laboratory based diagnostics to more accessible, automated home based solutions, improving patient outcomes and broadening the accessibility of sleep disorder diagnostics.

Title: Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks Based Inertial Signal Translation
Authors: Marcin Kolakowski
Abstract: The paper presents an approach in which inertial signals measured with a wrist-worn sensor (e.g., a smartwatch) are translated into those that would be recorded using a shoe-mounted sensor, enabling the use of state-of-the-art gait analysis methods. In the study, the signals are translated using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Two different GAN versions are used for experimental verification: traditional ones trained using binary cross-entropy loss and Wasserstein GANs (WGANs). For the generator, two architectures, a convolutional autoencoder, and a convolutional U-Net, are tested. The experiment results have shown that the proposed approach allows for an accurate translation, enabling the use of wrist sensor inertial signals for efficient, every-day gait analysis.

Title: A Fluid Antenna Enabled Physical Layer Key Generation for Next-G Wireless Networks
Authors: Jiacheng Guo, Ning Gao, Yiping Zuo, Hao Xu, Shi Jin, Kai Kit Wong
Abstract: As a promising physical layer security technique, physical layer key generation (PLKG) enables legitimate users to obtain secret keys from wireless channel without security infrastructures. However, in harsh propagation environments, the channel characteristic becomes unsatisfactory, the key generation rate (KGR) is significantly deteriorated. In this paper, we propose a novel fluid antenna (FA) enabled PLKG system to address this challenge. Specifically, we first derive the closed-form expression of the KGR for FA array, and then jointly optimize the precoding matrix and the antenna positions via a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Next, to further reduce the computational complexity of the optimization procedure, we develop an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, which combines the projected gradient descent (PGD) and the PSO. Simulation results demonstrate that by exploiting the additional spatial degree of freedom (DoF), our FA enabled PLKG system is superior to the benchmarks, such as the conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) array and the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). It is worth highlighting that compared to the conventional uniform planar antenna (UPA), the FA enabled PLKG achieves a 35.42\% KGR performance improvement under PSO algorithm and a 67.73\% KGR performance improvement under AO algorithm, respectively.

Title: DeepEmoNet: Building Machine Learning Models for Automatic Emotion Recognition in Human Speeches
Authors: Tai Vu
Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) has been a challenging problem in spoken language processing research, because it is unclear how human emotions are connected to various components of sounds such as pitch, loudness, and energy. This paper aims to tackle this problem using machine learning. Particularly, we built several machine learning models using SVMs, LTSMs, and CNNs to classify emotions in human speeches. In addition, by leveraging transfer learning and data augmentation, we efficiently trained our models to attain decent performances on a relatively small dataset. Our best model was a ResNet34 network, which achieved an accuracy of $66.7\%$ and an F1 score of $0.631$.

Title: Design and Testing of a Low-Cost 3D-Printed Servo Gimbal for Thrust Vector Control in Model Rockets
Authors: Ekansh Singh
Abstract: Thrust vector control (TVC) is a key mechanism for stabilizing rockets during flight, yet conventional implementations remain costly and technically inaccessible to students and hobbyists. This paper presents the design, fabrication, and testing of a low-cost, 3D-printed, servo-driven two-dimensional gimbal developed for model rocket applications. The gimbal underwent more than 60 CAD iterations, with servo selection guided by torque, response time, and stability requirements. A high-speed camera and Fusion 360 parameter simulations were used to emulate dynamic instability, enabling evaluation of angular deflection, servo responsiveness, and structural durability. The results demonstrated stable actuation within plus or minus 5 degrees, with response times on the average order of 44.5 ms, while limitations included servo fatigue and pin-joint stress under extended loading. The project highlights the feasibility of student-accessible thrust vector control systems and their potential as a reproducible platform for STEM education and experimental aerospace research.

Title: Amplifying Emotional Signals: Data-Efficient Deep Learning for Robust Speech Emotion Recognition
Authors: Tai Vu
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) presents a significant yet persistent challenge in human-computer interaction. While deep learning has advanced spoken language processing, achieving high performance on limited datasets remains a critical hurdle. This paper confronts this issue by developing and evaluating a suite of machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for automated emotion classification in human speech. We demonstrate that by strategically employing transfer learning and innovative data augmentation techniques, our models can achieve impressive performance despite the constraints of a relatively small dataset. Our most effective model, a ResNet34 architecture, establishes a new performance benchmark on the combined RAVDESS and SAVEE datasets, attaining an accuracy of 66.7% and an F1 score of 0.631. These results underscore the substantial benefits of leveraging pre-trained models and data augmentation to overcome data scarcity, thereby paving the way for more robust and generalizable SER systems.

Authors: Tatiana Likhomanenko, Luke Carlson, Richard He Bai, Zijin Gu, Han Tran, Zakaria Aldeneh, Yizhe Zhang, Ruixiang Zhang, Huangjie Zheng, Navdeep Jaitly
Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has transformed spoken dialog systems, yet the optimal architecture for real-time on-device voice agents remains an open question. While end-to-end approaches promise theoretical advantages, cascaded systems (CSs) continue to outperform them in language understanding tasks, despite being constrained by sequential processing latency. In this work, we introduce ChipChat, a novel low-latency CS that overcomes traditional bottlenecks through architectural innovations and streaming optimizations. Our system integrates streaming (a) conversational speech recognition with mixture-of-experts, (b) state-action augmented LLM, (c) text-to-speech synthesis, (d) neural vocoder, and (e) speaker modeling. Implemented using MLX, ChipChat achieves sub-second response latency on a Mac Studio without dedicated GPUs, while preserving user privacy through complete on-device processing. Our work shows that strategically redesigned CSs can overcome their historical latency limitations, offering a promising path forward for practical voice-based AI agents.

Title: Automatic Pronunciation Error Detection and Correction of the Holy Quran's Learners Using Deep Learning
Authors: Abdullah Abdelfattah, Mahmoud I. Khalil, Hazem Abbas
Abstract: Assessing spoken language is challenging, and quantifying pronunciation metrics for machine learning models is even harder. However, for the Holy Quran, this task is simplified by the rigorous recitation rules (tajweed) established by Muslim scholars, enabling highly effective assessment. Despite this advantage, the scarcity of high-quality annotated data remains a significant barrier. In this work, we bridge these gaps by introducing: (1) A 98% automated pipeline to produce high-quality Quranic datasets -- encompassing: Collection of recitations from expert reciters, Segmentation at pause points (waqf) using our fine-tuned wav2vec2-BERT model, Transcription of segments, Transcript verification via our novel Tasmeea algorithm; (2) 850+ hours of audio (~300K annotated utterances); (3) A novel ASR-based approach for pronunciation error detection, utilizing our custom Quran Phonetic Script (QPS) to encode Tajweed rules (unlike the IPA standard for Modern Standard Arabic). QPS uses a two-level script: (Phoneme level): Encodes Arabic letters with short/long vowels. (Sifa level): Encodes articulation characteristics of every phoneme. We further include comprehensive modeling with our novel multi-level CTC Model which achieved 0.16% average Phoneme Error Rate (PER) on the testset. We release all code, data, and models as open-source: this https URL

Title: Quantum-Enhanced Analysis and Grading of Vocal Performance
Authors: Rohan Agarwal
Abstract: We present QuantumMelody, a hybrid quantum-classical method for objective singing assessment. Grouped vocal features (pitch stability, dynamics, timbre) are encoded into a small simulated quantum circuit; all nine qubits are initialized with a Hadamard on each qubit and then receive Rx, Ry, and Rz rotations, with intra- and cross-group entanglement. The circuit measurement probabilities are fused with spectrogram transformer embeddings to estimate a grade on labels 2-5 and to surface technique-level feedback. On 168 labeled 20 second excerpts, the hybrid reaches 74.29% agreement with expert graders, a +12.86 point gain over a classical-features baseline. Processing is sub-minute per recording on a laptop-class Qiskit simulator; we do not claim hardware speedups. This is a feasibility step toward interpretable, objective singing assessment in applied audio signal processing.

Title: Comparative Techno-economic Assessment of Wind-Powered Green Hydrogen Pathways
Authors: Merlinda Andoni, Benoit Couraud, Valentin Robu, Jamie Blanche, Sonam Norbu, Si Chen, Satria Putra Kanugrahan, David Flynn
Abstract: Amid global interest in resilient energy systems, green hydrogen is considered vital to the net-zero transition, yet its deployment remains limited by high production cost. The cost is determined by the its production pathway, system configuration, asset location, and interplay with electricity markets and regulatory frameworks. To compare different deployment strategies in the UK, we develop a comprehensive techno-economic framework based on the Levelised Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH) assessment. We apply this framework to 5 configurations of wind-electrolyser systems, identify the most cost-effective business cases, and conduct a sensitivity analysis of key economic parameters. Our results reveal that electricity cost is the dominant contributor to LCOH, followed by the electrolyser cost. Our work highlights the crucial role that location, market arrangements and control strategies among RES and hydrogen investors play in the economic feasibility of deploying green hydrogen systems. Policies that subsidise low-cost electricity access and optimise deployment can lower LCOH, enhancing the economic competitiveness of green hydrogen.

Title: Spatio-Temporal Life Cycle Analysis of Electrolytic H2 Production in Australia under Time-Varying CO2 Management Schemes
Authors: Niraj Gohil, Alexander Franke, Nawshad Haque, Amro M. Farid
Abstract: The transition to sustainable energy is critical for addressing global climate change. Hydrogen production, particularly via electrolysis, has emerged as a key solution, offering the potential for low-carbon energy across various sectors. This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing hydrogen production by aligning it with periods of low-carbon intensity on the electricity grid. Leveraging real-time data from the Electricity Mapping database and real-time electricity cost data from the AEMO database, the model dynamically adjusts hydrogen output to minimize both emissions and production costs. Furthermore, the integration of hydrogen tax credits significantly enhances cost-effectiveness, offering a viable pathway for widespread adoption. A comprehensive Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) framework is employed to assess the environmental impacts, emphasizing the need for real-time data incorporation to more accurately reflect hydrogen production's carbon footprint. The study concludes that dynamic, real-time operation, coupled with financial incentives, provides a promising method to enhance the sustainability and economic viability of hydrogen production.

Title: A Review of Sensor Insoles
Authors: Bastian Latsch, Felix Herbst, Mark Suppelt, Julian Seiler, Stephan Schaumann, Sven Suppelt, Alexander A. Altmann, Martin Grimmer, and Mario Kupnik
Abstract: Plantar pressure measurement, or pedobarography, is an essential tool for analyzing human motion in healthy individuals and patients. Across the reviewed literature, sensor insoles are motivated as wearable, mobile solutions for assessing pressure distribution in applications including diabetic foot monitoring, rehabilitation guidance, assistive device control, and sports performance analysis. This review evaluates the current state of the art with particular attention to sensor technologies, sensor quantity and placement, participant cohorts, and reference standards. The focus lies on original works with innovative designs, preferably supported by ambulation experiments. The modalities covered include resistive, capacitive, inductive, piezoelectric, triboelectric, and optical sensing approaches. We identify a lack of proper sensor calibration, gait-based verification, and human study validation, and propose a gold standard based on testing machines and instrumented treadmills to ensure comparability across studies. The bidirectional interaction between insole insertion and foot-sole mechanics is examined, with tissue stiffness identified as a key source of uncertainty in sensor signals. Guidelines are provided for sensor dimensions and unobtrusive insole designs to foster natural gait. Finally, future directions include the development of multimodal sensors to compensate for limitations of individual modalities and the emerging trend of multiaxial sensing for capturing shear components in pressure distributions.

Title: Two-Stage Mechanism Design for Electric Vehicle Charging with Day-Ahead Reservations
Authors: Pan-Yang Su, Yi Ju, Scott Moura, Shankar Sastry
Abstract: We propose a general two-period model where electrical vehicles (EVs) can reserve charging sessions in the day-ahead market and swap them in the real-time market. Under the model, we explore several candidate mechanisms for running the two markets, compared using several normative properties such as incentive compatibility, efficiency, reservation awareness, and budget balance. Specifically, reservation awareness is the only property coupling the two markets and dictates that an EV will not get a lower utility by joining the real-time market. Focusing on the real-time market, we show that two variants of the classical Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism do not satisfy all the proposed properties; specifically, one is not reservation-aware, while the other is not budget-balanced. Moreover, we show that no mechanism satisfies some combinations of the properties. Then, we propose to use a posted-price mechanism to resolve the issue, which turns out to be the dynamic pricing mechanism adopted in many real-world systems. The proposed mechanism has no efficiency guarantee but satisfies all the other properties. To improve efficiency, we propose to use a VCG auction in the day-ahead market that guides the reserve prices in the real-time market. When EVs' valuations in the two markets are highly correlated, the proposed approach results in highly efficient outcomes.

Title: High-Power Wide-Bandwidth High-Quality Modular Pulse Synthesizer with Adaptive Voltage Asymmetry in Medical Power Electronics
Authors: Jinshui Zhang, Stefan M. Goetz
Abstract: Noninvasive brain stimulation can write signals into neurons but requires power electronics with exceptionally high power in the mega-volt-ampere range and kilohertz usable bandwidth. Whereas oscillator circuits offered only one or very few pulse shapes, modular cascaded power electronics solved a long-standing problem for the first time and enabled arbitrary software-based synthesis of the temporal shape of stimuli. However, synthesizing arbitrary stimuli with a high output quality requires a large number of modules. We propose an alternative solution that achieves high-resolution pulse shaping with fewer modules by implementing high-power wide-bandwidth voltage asymmetry. Rather than equal voltage steps, our system strategically assigns different voltages to each module to achieve a near-exponential improvement in resolution. The module voltage sequence does also not use just a simple binary pattern other work might suggest but adapts it to the output. Additionally, we introduce a switched-capacitor charging mechanism that allows the modules to charge to different voltages through a single dc power supply. We validated our design in a head-to-head comparison with the state of the art on experimental prototypes. Our three-module prototype reduces total voltage distortion by 13.4% compared to prior art with three modules, and by 4.5% compared to prior art with six -- twice as many -- modules. This paper is the first asymmetric multilevel circuit as a high-precision high-power synthesizer, as well as the first to adaptively optimize asymmetric voltage sequence in modular power electronics.

Title: A Layered Control Perspective on Legged Locomotion: Embedding Reduced Order Models via Hybrid Zero Dynamics
Authors: Sergio A. Esteban, Max H. Cohen, Adrian B. Ghansah, Aaron D. Ames
Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) provide a powerful means of synthesizing dynamic walking gaits on legged robots. Yet this approach lacks the formal guarantees enjoyed by methods that utilize the full-order model (FOM) for gait synthesis, e.g., hybrid zero dynamics. This paper aims to unify these approaches through a layered control perspective. In particular, we establish conditions on when a ROM of locomotion yields stable walking on the full-order hybrid dynamics. To achieve this result, given an ROM we synthesize a zero dynamics manifold encoding the behavior of the ROM -- controllers can be synthesized that drive the FOM to this surface, yielding hybrid zero dynamics. We prove that a stable periodic orbit in the ROM implies an input-to-state stable periodic orbit of the FOM's hybrid zero dynamics, and hence the FOM dynamics. This result is demonstrated in simulation on a linear inverted pendulum ROM and a 5-link planar walking FOM.

Title: CoMET: A Contrastive-Masked Brain Foundation Model for Universal EEG Representation
Authors: Ang Li, Zikai Wang, Liuyin Yang, Zhenyu Wang, Tianheng Xu, Honglin Hu, Marc M. Van Hulle
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique for recording brain activity, widely used in brain-computer interfaces, clinic, and healthcare. Traditional EEG deep models typically focus on specific dataset and task, limiting model size and generalization. Recently, self-supervised brain foundation models have emerged and been applied to various downstream tasks. Nevertheless, these models still have limitations: current SOTA models typically rely on masked reconstruction strategy; however, EEG features of adjacent channels are highly correlated, which causes the pre-training to overly focus on low-dimensional signal-similarity features in local regions and neglect the global discriminative patterns vital for downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a brain foundation model called CoMET. Specifically, we employ the masked autoencoder with redesigned patching and embedding for EEG as backbone and devise a novel contrastive learning framework with mirror-scale augmentation to strengthen the global discrimination ability. CoMET is pre-trained on mixed EEG datasets over 3000 subjects with over one million samples. It is evaluated on ten different downstream datasets, and the SOTA results demonstrate CoMET's superior ability in extracting universal EEG representations and strong clinical potential.

Title: Gait Analysis using 6DoF Magnetic Tracking
Authors: R. Abhishek Shankar, Hyungjun Ha, Byunghoo Jung
Abstract: Gait analysis using wearable devices has advantages over non-wearable devices when it comes to portability and accessibility. However, non-wearable devices have consistently shown superior performance in terms of the gait information they can provide. This calls for the need to improve the performance of wearable device based gait analysis. To that end, we developed a 6 Degrees-of-Freedom (6DoF) magnetic tracking based gait analysis system as a step in this direction. The system is portable, minimally intrusive, wireless and power efficient. As a proof-of-concept, the system was used for the task of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) to classify four tasks - walking (W), walking with weight (WW), jogging (J) and marching on the spot (M). Gait data of 12 participants was collected. The classification performance of two deep learning (DL) classifiers - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) - was compared. The performance of the magnetic tracking based gait analysis system was also compared with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) + magnetometer based system. The magnetic tracking based system showed an overall classification accuracy of 92\% compared to 86.69\% for the IMU + magnetometer system. Moreover, the magnetic tracking system showed an improvement of about 8\% in being able to differentiate between W and WW. This highlights the insufficiency in the information content in the data from IMU + magnetometer, warranting the need for a complete 6DoF tracking. Our work, thus, proves the feasibility of using magnetic tracking systems for the purpose of gait analysis.

Title: AN-Aided Secure Beamforming for ELAA-SWIPT in Mixed Near- and Far-Field
Authors: Yaqian Yi, Guangchi Zhang, Miao Cui, Changsheng You, Qingqing Wu
Abstract: This letter investigates secure hybrid beamforming (HB) design for an extremely large-scale antenna array-aided simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system operating in a mixed near-field (NF)/far-field (FF) environment. A base station (BS) employs HB to transmit information and artificial noise (AN) signals simultaneously to multiple FF information receivers (IRs) and NF energy receivers (ERs). The objective is to maximize the weighted sum secrecy rate for the IRs, considering both Type-I (unable to cancel AN) and Type-II (capable of canceling AN) IRs, subject to minimum energy harvesting requirements at the ERs and a BS transmit power constraint. We formulate optimization problems for both IR types and develop an efficient iterative algorithm based on successive convex approximation. Simulation results validate the proposed scheme and provide crucial insights into the security performance of mixed-field SWIPT systems, highlighting the influence of visibility regions and angular user separation.

Title: A Quantum-Compliant Formulation for Network Epidemic Control
Authors: Lorenzo Zino, Mattia Boggio, Deborah Volpe, Giacomo Orlandi, Giovanna Turvani, Carlo Novara
Abstract: We deal with controlling the spread of an epidemic disease on a network by isolating one or multiple locations by banning people from leaving them. To this aim, we build on the susceptible-infected-susceptible and the susceptible-infected-removed discrete-time network models, encapsulating a control action that captures mobility bans via removing links from the network. Then, we formulate the problem of optimally devising a control policy based on mobility bans that trades-off the burden on the healthcare system and the social and economic costs associated with interventions. The binary nature of mobility bans hampers the possibility to solve the control problem with standard optimization methods, yielding a NP-hard problem. Here, this is tackled by deriving a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation of the control problem, and leveraging the growing potentialities of quantum computing to efficiently solve it.

Title: Solving Optimal Power Flow using a Variational Quantum Approach
Authors: Thinh Viet Le, Mark M. Wilde, Vassilis Kekatos
Abstract: The optimal power flow (OPF) is a large-scale optimization problem that is central in the operation of electric power systems. Although it can be posed as a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program, the complexity of modern-day power grids raises scalability and optimality challenges. In this context, this work proposes a variational quantum paradigm for solving the OPF. We encode primal variables through the state of a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC), and dual variables through the probability mass function associated with a second PQC. The Lagrangian function can thus be expressed as scaled expectations of quantum observables. An OPF solution can be found by minimizing/maximizing the Lagrangian over the parameters of the first/second PQC. We pursue saddle points of the Lagrangian in a hybrid fashion. Gradients of the Lagrangian are estimated using the two PQCs, while PQC parameters are updated classically using a primal-dual method. We propose permuting primal variables so that OPF observables are expressed in a banded form, allowing them to be measured efficiently. Numerical tests on the IEEE 57-node power system using Pennylane's simulator corroborate that the proposed doubly variational quantum framework can find high-quality OPF solutions. Although showcased for the OPF, this framework features a broader scope, including conic programs with numerous variables and constraints, problems defined over sparse graphs, and training quantum machine learning models to satisfy constraints.

Title: A Novel Decoupled LVRT Control Strategy for Transient Voltage Stability Enhancement of IBRs Using Voltage-Angle Coupling Analysis
Authors: Fangyuan Sun, Ruisheng Diao, Ruiyuan Zeng, Jing Zhang, Jianguo Qian
Abstract: With the fast-increasing penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs), the voltage support capability of the grid following (GFL) IBRs under low voltage ride through (LVRT) control significantly influences the transient voltage stability of the power system. The existing LVRT adjusts the q-axis current to regulate reactive power injection. However, under a large disturbance, the phase-locked loop (PLL) error invalidates the proportional relationship between the q-axis current and reactive power, consequently causing deviation in the actual reactive power injection of the IBR. Besides, the variation of IBR current, determined by the PLL phase and LVRT, also directly influences the transient voltage. To address this issue, the specific influence of PLL error on active and reactive power injection is first analyzed under LVRT control. In addition, by combining the LVRT and PLL dynamics, the mechanisms of three voltage problems caused by voltage angle coupling are revealed. overvoltage, low voltage, and DC-side overvoltage. The specific scenarios in which these voltage stability problems occur are also obtained by the voltage-vector-triangle graphic. Furthermore, a power angle decoupled LVRT control is proposed to eliminate the influence of voltage angle coupling. Finally, the mechanism analysis and effectiveness of the decoupled LVRT are verified in the case study.

Title: Deep Learning for Personalized Binaural Audio Reproduction
Authors: Xikun Lu, Yunda Chen, Zehua Chen, Jie Wang, Mingxing Liu, Hongmei Hu, Chengshi Zheng, Stefan Bleeck, Jinqiu Sang
Abstract: Personalized binaural audio reproduction is the basis of realistic spatial localization, sound externalization, and immersive listening, directly shaping user experience and listening effort. This survey reviews recent advances in deep learning for this task and organizes them by generation mechanism into two paradigms: explicit personalized filtering and end-to-end rendering. Explicit methods predict personalized head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) from sparse measurements, morphological features, or environmental cues, and then use them in the conventional rendering pipeline. End-to-end methods map source signals directly to binaural signals, aided by other inputs such as visual, textual, or parametric guidance, and they learn personalization within the model. We also summarize the field's main datasets and evaluation metrics to support fair and repeatable comparison. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of key applications enabled by these technologies, current technical limitations, and potential research directions for deep learning-based spatial audio systems.

Authors: Getuar Rexhepi, Kuranage Roche Rayan Ranasinghe, Kengo Ando, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, David Gonzalez G
Abstract: This paper tackles two key challenges in cell-freemassive multiple input multiple output (CF-mMIMO) systems:efficient pilot allocation and practical receiver design. To thisend, we introduce a novel pilot allocation framework leveragingmanifold optimization to maximize the system sum rate, wherepilot sequences are designed as nearly orthogonal sequences. Theproposed pilot design enforces unimodularity constraints in thefrequency domain, ensuring pilots are suitable for both communi-cation and sensing tasks. Additionally, a gaussian belief propaga-tion (GaBP)-based receiver is introduced, providing near-optimaldetection performance with substantially reduced computationalcomplexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposedpilot allocation method achieves communication performancecomparable to state-of-the-art (SotA) algorithms, while deliveringsuperior sensing capabilities due to its unimodular pilot this http URL GaBP-based receiver achieves robust performance andlower complexity compared to conventional approaches. Thesecontributions advance the practical deployment of CF-mMIMOfor integrated sensing and communications (ISAC).

Title: A Novel Method to Determine Total Oxidant Concentration Produced by Non-Thermal Plasma Based on Image Processing and Machine Learning
Authors: Mirkan Emir Sancak, Unal Sen, Ulker Diler Keris-Sen
Abstract: Accurate determination of total oxidant concentration ([Ox]_{tot}) in non-thermal plasma (NTP)-treated aqueous systems remains a critical challenge due to the transient nature of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and the subjectivity of conventional titration methods used for [Ox]_{tot} determination. This study introduces a novel, color-based computer analysis (CBCA) method that integrates advanced image processing with machine learning (ML) to quantify colorimetric shifts in potassium iodide (KI) solutions during oxidation. First, a custom-built visual data acquisition system captured high-resolution video of the color transitions in a KI solution during oxidation with an NTP system. The change in [Ox]_{tot} during the experiments was monitored with a standard titrimetric method. Second, the captured frames were processed using a robust image processing pipeline to extract RGB, HSV, and Lab color features. The extracted features were statistically evaluated, and the results revealed strong linear correlations with the measured [Ox]_{tot} values, particularly in the saturation (HSV), a and b (Lab), and blue (RGB) channels. Subsequently, the [Ox]_{tot} measurements and the extracted color features were used to train and validate five ML models. Among them, linear regression and gradient boosting models achieved the highest predictive accuracy (R^2 > 0.990). It was also found that reducing the feature set from nine to four resulted in comparable performance with improved prediction efficiency, especially for gradient boosting. Finally, comparison of the model predictions with real titration measurements revealed that the CBCA system successfully predicts the [Ox]_{tot} in KI solution with high accuracy (R^2 > 0.998) even with a reduced number of features.

Title: Improved PLL Design for Transient Stability Enhancement of Grid Following Converters Based on Lyapunov Method
Authors: Fangyuan Sun, Ruisheng Diao, Ruiyuan Zeng, Junjie Li, Wangqianyun Tang
Abstract: Fluctuations in phase angle and frequency under large disturbances can lead to loss of synchronism (LOS) in grid-following (GFL) converters. The power angle and frequency of synchronous generators (SGs) correspond to rotor position and speed, whereas those of converters lack a direct physical counterpart in the real world and can thus be directly adjusted by control methods to prevent loss of synchronization. In this paper, an improved phase-locked loop (PLL) design with reset control for GFL converters is proposed to enhance transient stability. The stability domain (SD) of a GFL converter is first analyzed, and three forms of SD are identified under different short circuit ratios. Secondly, based on the characteristics of the three SD forms, two PLL-reset methods are proposed, including omega reset and omega&delta reset. Thirdly, to provide the triggering conditions for the PLL-reset control, the Lyapunov function of the GFL converter is constructed based on three methods: the approximation-based Lyapunov method, the Zubov method, and the analytical trajectory reversing method. All these methods are immune to the negative damping problem of PLL dynamics, which makes traditional energy-perspective Lyapunov functions invalid. Finally, the estimation accuracy of the three Lyapunov-based methods is analyzed, and the effectiveness of the PLL-reset control is verified in single-machine and multi-machine case studies.

Title: Distributed Deployment and Dual-Frequency Concepts to Strengthen Sub-THz Wireless Systems
Authors: Liesbet Van der Perre, Gilles Callebaut, Thomas Eriksson, Muris Sarajlic, Christian Fager, Fredrik Tufvesson, Buon Kiong Lau, Erik G. Larsson
Abstract: The vast bandwidth available at sub-THz frequencies holds great promise for high-speed wireless access, precise localization, and advanced sensing applications. However, fundamental physical constraints and technological limitations make the deployment of reliable sub-THz networks challenging. We propose a new paradigm for sub-THz coverage by transmitting the RF signals over polymer microwave fibers (PMFs) that interconnect low-complexity radio units (RUs) in a daisy-chain configuration. The distributed architecture ensures that user equipments (UEs) connect to RUs in their proximity, reducing path loss and mitigating blocking. The RUs leverage low-complexity, compact integrated antenna modules. Additionally, dual-frequency tandem operation is proposed, integrating the sub-THz system with a sub-10 GHz system that provides control signalling and a robust fallback solution for the sub-THz system. This proposed tandem architecture can open up the full potential of sub-THz technology and paves the way to cost- and energy-efficient, high-performance, real-time connectivity in dynamic environments.

Title: Game Theoretic Resilience Recommendation Framework for CyberPhysical Microgrids Using Hypergraph MetaLearning
Authors: S Krishna Niketh, Prasanta K Panigrahi, V Vignesh, Mayukha Pal
Abstract: This paper presents a physics-aware cyberphysical resilience framework for radial microgrids under coordinated cyberattacks. The proposed approach models the attacker through a hypergraph neural network (HGNN) enhanced with model agnostic metalearning (MAML) to rapidly adapt to evolving defense strategies and predict high-impact contingencies. The defender is modeled via a bi-level Stackelberg game, where the upper level selects optimal tie-line switching and distributed energy resource (DER) dispatch using an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) coordinator embedded within the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). The framework simultaneously optimizes load served, operational cost, and voltage stability, ensuring all post-defense states satisfy network physics constraints. The methodology is first validated on the IEEE 69-bus distribution test system with 12 DERs, 8 critical loads, and 5 tie-lines, and then extended to higher bus systems including the IEEE 123-bus feeder and a synthetic 300-bus distribution system. Results show that the proposed defense strategy restores nearly full service for 90% of top-ranked attacks, mitigates voltage violations, and identifies Feeder 2 as the principal vulnerability corridor. Actionable operating rules are derived, recommending pre-arming of specific tie-lines to enhance resilience, while higher bus system studies confirm scalability of the framework on the IEEE 123-bus and 300-bus systems.

Title: A Comprehensive Approach to Evaluate Frequency Control Strength of Power Systems
Authors: Taulant Kerci, Federico Milano
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of "frequency control strength" as a novel approach to understand how different real-world power systems compare to each other in terms of effectiveness and performance of system-wide frequency control. It presents a comprehensive comparison, based on measurement data, of the frequency control strength of four real-world, renewable-based, synchronous islands power systems, namely Great Britain (GB), All-Island power system (AIPS) of Ireland, and Australia (AUS) mainland and Tasmania (TAS). The strength is evaluated by means of different frequency quality metrics. The common understanding is that the bigger the capacity of a power system, the bigger its robustness with respect to events and contingencies. Here we show that this is not always the case in the context of frequency control. In fact, our study shows that mainland AUS shows the highest frequency control strength during normal operating conditions, whereas the AIPS shows the highest relative frequency control strength for abnormal system conditions. The strength is, in particular, greatly influenced by different regulatory requirements and different system/ancillary services arrangements in each jurisdiction. The paper also provides possible mitigations to improve frequency control strength through grid codes and market rules.

Title: Robust Resource Allocation for LEO Satellite-Assisted Secure SWIPT via STAR-RIS under CSI Uncertainty
Authors: Zahra Rostamikafaki, Francois Chan, Claude D'Amours
Abstract: This paper proposes a robust resource allocation framework for a low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite-enabled simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system, assisted by a ground-deployed simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS). We consider a scenario where direct satellite-to-ground links are obstructed, and the satellite serves multiple single-antenna energy receivers, information receivers, and eavesdroppers exclusively via the STAR-RIS. A robust optimization problem is formulated to maximize the total harvested power, subject to secrecy rate requirements, transmit power limits, and STAR-RIS coefficient constraints, under a practical bounded channel state information (CSI) error model. To achieve optimal robust resource allocation, we address the challenges posed by coupled optimization variables and bounded channel estimation errors by first applying the S-procedure to handle robustness against channel uncertainty. An alternating optimization (AO) framework is subsequently proposed, where the active beamforming at the LEO satellite and the passive beamforming at the STAR-RIS are jointly optimized, and a penalty-based strategy is incorporated to enforce the STAR-RIS beamforming design. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate that the STAR-RIS architecture achieves substantial performance gains in total harvested power over conventional RIS and other baseline schemes.

Title: Realization of Precise Perforating Using Dynamic Threshold and Physical Plausibility Algorithm for Self-Locating Perforating in Oil and Gas Wells
Authors: Siyu Xiao, Guohui Ren, Tianhao Mao, Yuqiao Chen, YiAn Liu, Junjie Wang, Kai Tang, Xindi Zhao, Zhijian Yu, Shuang Liu, Tupei Chen, Yang Liu
Abstract: Accurate depth measurement is essential for optimizing oil and gas resource development, as it directly impacts production efficiency. However, achieving precise depth and perforating at the correct location remains a significant challenge due to field operational constraints and equipment limitations. In this work, we propose the Dynamic Threshold and Physical Plausibility Depth Measurement and Perforation Control (DTPPMP) system, a solution integrated into perforating guns that enables real-time, precise depth measurement and perforation at designated perforating intervals. The system autonomously samples, processes and identifies signals from a casing collar locator (CCL) in situ within oil and gas wells. Casing collar identification is achieved using a lightweight dynamic threshold and physical plausibility algorithm deployed on an embedded platform, which serves as the system's processor. Field tests conducted in an actual oil well in Sichuan, China, demonstrated the DTPPMP's ability to accurately identify casing collar signals, measure depths, and effectively perforate at designated perforating intervals in real-time. The system achieved a perforation variation of less than the length of a single perforating interval and a F1 score of 98.6% for casing collar identification. These results provide valuable recommendations for advancing automation and intelligence in future perforation operations.

Title: Promptable Longitudinal Lesion Segmentation in Whole-Body CT
Authors: Yannick Kirchhoff, Maximilian Rokuss, Fabian Isensee, Klaus H. Maier-Hein
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of lesions in longitudinal whole-body CT is essential for monitoring disease progression and treatment response. While automated methods benefit from incorporating longitudinal information, they remain limited in their ability to consistently track individual lesions across time. Task 2 of the autoPET/CT IV Challenge addresses this by providing lesion localizations and baseline delineations, framing the problem as longitudinal promptable segmentation. In this work, we extend the recently proposed LongiSeg framework with promptable capabilities, enabling lesion-specific tracking through point and mask interactions. To address the limited size of the provided training set, we leverage large-scale pretraining on a synthetic longitudinal CT dataset. Our experiments show that pretraining substantially improves the ability to exploit longitudinal context, yielding an improvement of up to 6 Dice points compared to models trained from scratch. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of combining longitudinal context with interactive prompting for robust lesion tracking. Code is publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Revisiting Deep AC-OPF
Authors: Oluwatomisin I. Dada, Neil D. Lawrence
Abstract: Recent work has proposed machine learning (ML) approaches as fast surrogates for solving AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF), with claims of significant speed-ups and high accuracy. In this paper, we revisit these claims through a systematic evaluation of ML models against a set of simple yet carefully designed linear baselines. We introduce OPFormer-V, a transformer-based model for predicting bus voltages, and compare it to both the state-of-the-art DeepOPF-V model and simple linear methods. Our findings reveal that, while OPFormer-V improves over DeepOPF-V, the relative gains of the ML approaches considered are less pronounced than expected. Simple linear baselines can achieve comparable performance. These results highlight the importance of including strong linear baselines in future evaluations.

Title: Cepstrum-Based Texture Features for Melanoma Detection
Authors: Keith Miller, Tristan Crawford, Jason Hagerty, William Stoecker, Ronald J. Stanley
Abstract: This paper introduces a set of cepstrum-based texture features for melanoma classification and validates their performance on dermoscopic images from the ISIC 2019 dataset. We propose applying gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) statistics to 2D cepstral representations, a novel approach in image analysis. Combined with established handcrafted lesion descriptors, these features were evaluated using XGBoost models. Incorporating select cepstral features improved the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, and F1 score for binary melanoma vs. nevus classification. Results suggest that cepstral GLCM features offer complementary discriminatory information for melanoma detection.

Title: PyNoetic: A modular python framework for no-code development of EEG brain-computer interfaces
Authors: Gursimran Singh, Aviral Chharia, Rahul Upadhyay, Vinay Kumar, Luca Longo
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have emerged as a transformative technology with applications spanning robotics, virtual reality, medicine, and rehabilitation. However, existing BCI frameworks face several limitations, including a lack of stage-wise flexibility essential for experimental research, steep learning curves for researchers without programming expertise, elevated costs due to reliance on proprietary software, and a lack of all-inclusive features leading to the use of multiple external tools affecting research outcomes. To address these challenges, we present PyNoetic, a modular BCI framework designed to cater to the diverse needs of BCI research. PyNoetic is one of the very few frameworks in Python that encompasses the entire BCI design pipeline, from stimulus presentation and data acquisition to channel selection, filtering, feature extraction, artifact removal, and finally simulation and visualization. Notably, PyNoetic introduces an intuitive and end-to-end GUI coupled with a unique pick-and-place configurable flowchart for no-code BCI design, making it accessible to researchers with minimal programming experience. For advanced users, it facilitates the seamless integration of custom functionalities and novel algorithms with minimal coding, ensuring adaptability at each design stage. PyNoetic also includes a rich array of analytical tools such as machine learning models, brain-connectivity indices, systematic testing functionalities via simulation, and evaluation methods of novel paradigms. PyNoetic's strengths lie in its versatility for both offline and real-time BCI development, which streamlines the design process, allowing researchers to focus on more intricate aspects of BCI development and thus accelerate their research endeavors.

Title: Speaker-Conditioned Phrase Break Prediction for Text-to-Speech with Phoneme-Level Pre-trained Language Model
Authors: Dong Yang, Yuki Saito, Takaaki Saeki, Tomoki Koriyama, Wataru Nakata, Detai Xin, Hiroshi Saruwatari
Abstract: This paper advances phrase break prediction (also known as phrasing) in multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS) systems. We integrate speaker-specific features by leveraging speaker embeddings to enhance the performance of the phrasing model. We further demonstrate that these speaker embeddings can capture speaker-related characteristics solely from the phrasing task. Besides, we explore the potential of pre-trained speaker embeddings for unseen speakers through a few-shot adaptation method. Furthermore, we pioneer the application of phoneme-level pre-trained language models to this TTS front-end task, which significantly boosts the accuracy of the phrasing model. Our methods are rigorously assessed through both objective and subjective evaluations, demonstrating their effectiveness.

Title: MPO: Multidimensional Preference Optimization for Language Model-based Text-to-Speech
Authors: Kangxiang Xia, Xinfa Zhu, Jixun Yao, Lei Xie
Abstract: In recent years, text-to-speech (TTS) has seen impressive advancements through large-scale language models, achieving human-level speech quality. Integrating human feedback has proven effective for enhancing robustness in these systems. However, current approaches face challenges in optimizing TTS with preference data across multiple dimensions and often suffer from performance degradation due to overconfidence in rewards. We propose Multidimensional Preference Optimization (MPO) to better align TTS systems with human preferences. MPO introduces a preference set that streamlines the construction of data for multidimensional preference optimization, enabling alignment with multiple dimensions. Additionally, we incorporate regularization during training to address the typical degradation issues in DPO-based approaches. Our experiments demonstrate MPO's effectiveness, showing significant improvements in intelligibility, speaker similarity, and prosody compared to baseline systems.

Title: Resting-state fMRI Analysis using Quantum Time-series Transformer
Authors: Junghoon Justin Park, Jungwoo Seo, Sangyoon Bae, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Huan-Hsin Tseng, Jiook Cha, Shinjae Yoo
Abstract: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a pivotal tool for revealing intrinsic brain network connectivity and identifying neural biomarkers of neuropsychiatric conditions. However, classical self-attention transformer models--despite their formidable representational power--struggle with quadratic complexity, large parameter counts, and substantial data requirements. To address these barriers, we introduce a Quantum Time-series Transformer, a novel quantum-enhanced transformer architecture leveraging Linear Combination of Unitaries and Quantum Singular Value Transformation. Unlike classical transformers, Quantum Time-series Transformer operates with polylogarithmic computational complexity, markedly reducing training overhead and enabling robust performance even with fewer parameters and limited sample sizes. Empirical evaluation on the largest-scale fMRI datasets from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study and the UK Biobank demonstrates that Quantum Time-series Transformer achieves comparable or superior predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art classical transformer models, with especially pronounced gains in small-sample scenarios. Interpretability analyses using SHapley Additive exPlanations further reveal that Quantum Time-series Transformer reliably identifies clinically meaningful neural biomarkers of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These findings underscore the promise of quantum-enhanced transformers in advancing computational neuroscience by more efficiently modeling complex spatio-temporal dynamics and improving clinical interpretability.

Title: Uninformed-to-Informed Estimation: A Ping-Pong Positioning Method for Multi-user Wideband mmWave Systems
Authors: Lin Guo, Tiejun Lv, Yashuai Cao, Mugen Peng
Abstract: To enhance the positioning and tracking performance of dynamic user equipment (UE) in wideband millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems, we propose a novel positioning error lower bound (PELB)-driven ping-pong positioning framework, where the base station (BS) and UE alternately transmit and receive adaptive beamforming signals for positioning. All beam-formers are scheduled based on the locally evaluated PELB. In this framework, we exploit multi-dimensional information fusion to assist in positioning. Firstly, a multi-subcarrier collaborative positioning error lower bound (MSCPEB) is proposed to evaluate the positioning error limits of wideband mmWave systems, which quantifies the contribution of all subcarriers to positioning accuracy. Moreover, we prove that the MSCPEB does not exceed the arithmetic mean of the PELBs of the individual subcarriers. Subsequently, we develop an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to optimize the hybrid beamformers targeted for MSCPEB minimization. By convexifying this problem, closed-form solutions of beamformers are derived. Finally, we develop a multipath collaborative positioning method that quantifies the impact of path reliability on positioning accuracy, with a closed-form solution for user position derived. The proposed method does not rely on path resolution and traditional triangular relationships. Numerical results validate that the proposed method improves estimation accuracy by at least 16% compared to potential schemes without optimized beam configurations, while requiring only approximately one-quarter of the slot resources.

Title: Characterization of Mega-Constellation Links for LEO Missions With Applications to EO and ISS Use Cases
Authors: G. Maiolini Capez, M. A. Caceres, C. P. Bridges, S. Frey, R. Armellin, R. Garello, P. Bargellini
Abstract: Satellite missions demand ever greater connectivity, especially in the LEO regime. In this paper, we introduce the new mega-constellation services in space paradigm: we show that megaconstellations, deployed to offer innovative services to Earth's users, can provide excellent connectivity to LEO spacecraft as well. First, we characterise the communication link between space users and the actual OneWeb and Starlink constellations. A full set of results in terms of availability, access duration, Doppler, and path losses as a function of user orbital parameters, identifying optimal user orbits, is provided. The results achieved by a multi-system user able to communicate with both fleets are also presented. The potential improvements available if geostationary constellations are used to complement LEO megaconstellations in a multi-orbit system are discussed as well. Finally, we focus on two LEO use cases: the International Space Station and an Earth Observation Sun Synchronous satellite. All the results demonstrate the numerous advantages of the mega-constellation connectivity solution, which can transform LEO spacecraft into highly responsive nodes of a space-to-space network.

Title: Fast Regularized 3D Near-Field MIMO Imaging Using Stochastic Proximal Gradient Method
Authors: Okyanus Oral
Abstract: Near-field multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar imaging suffers from high computational load inherently due to irregular spatial sampling with distributed antennas. Existing acceleration methods for near-field MIMO imaging typically rely on interpolation or compensation of measurements and are primarily developed for direct reconstruction. This hinders their ease of adoption for different MIMO geometries and requires further modification for regularized inversion. In this study, we address these challenges by developing a fast regularized reconstruction approach for three-dimensional near-field MIMO imaging based on the Stochastic Proximal Gradient Method. We demonstrate the performance of the developed approach through experimental measurements. The results show a significant improvement in runtime without any notable compromise in reconstruction quality.

Title: Deep Unfolding with Approximated Computations for Rapid Optimization
Authors: Dvir Avrahami, Amit Milstein, Caroline Chaux, Tirza Routtenberg, Nir Shlezinger
Abstract: Optimization-based solvers play a central role in a wide range of signal processing and communication tasks. However, their applicability in latency-sensitive systems is limited by the sequential nature of iterative methods and the high computational cost per iteration. While deep unfolding has emerged as a powerful paradigm for converting iterative algorithms into learned models that operate with a fixed number of iterations, it does not inherently address the cost of each iteration. In this paper, we introduce a learned optimization framework that jointly tackles iteration count and per-iteration complexity. Our approach is based on unfolding a fixed number of optimization steps, replacing selected iterations with low-complexity approximated computations, and learning extended hyperparameters from data to compensate for the introduced approximations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on two representative problems: (i) hybrid beamforming; and (ii) robust principal component analysis. These fundamental case studies show that our learned approximated optimizers can achieve state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational complexity by over three orders of magnitude. Our results highlight the potential of our approach to enable rapid, interpretable, and efficient decision-making in real-time systems.

Title: Adaptation of Parameters in Heterogeneous Multi-agent Systems
Authors: Hyungbo Shim, Jin Gyu Lee, B. D. O. Anderson
Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptation mechanism for heterogeneous multi-agent systems to align the agents' internal parameters, based on enforced consensus through strong couplings. Unlike homogeneous systems, where exact consensus is attainable, the heterogeneity in node dynamics precludes perfect synchronization. Nonetheless, previous work has demonstrated that strong coupling can induce approximate consensus, whereby the agents exhibit emergent collective behavior governed by the so-called blended dynamics. Building on this observation, we introduce an adaptation law that gradually aligns the internal parameters of agents without requiring direct parameter communication. The proposed method reuses the same coupling signal employed for state synchronization, which may result in a biologically or sociologically plausible adaptation process. Under a persistent excitation condition, we prove that the linearly parametrized vector fields of the agents converge to each other, thereby making the dynamics asymptotically homogeneous, and leading to exact consensus of the state variables.

Title: Spectrum Cognition: Semantic Situation for Next-Generation Spectrum Management
Authors: Hao Zhang, Fuhui Zhou, Qihui Wuand Chau Yuen
Abstract: In response to the growing complexity and demands of future wireless communication networks, spectrum cognition has emerged as an essential technique for optimizing spectrum utilization in next-generation wireless networks. This article presents a comprehensive overview of spectrum cognition, underscoring its critical role in enhancing the efficiency and security of future wireless systems through the innovative perspective of "data processing to signal analysis to semantic situation". Semantic situation, as the highest level of spectrum cognition, enables the extraction of meaningful information from raw spectrum data to provide intelligent support for network decisions. We formally define spectrum cognition, clearly distinguishing it from traditional spectrum sensing, and delve into the latest advancements in both traditional and intelligent spectrum cognition frameworks, addressing key challenges in spectrum cognition. Furthermore, we propose concrete technical solutions to address these challenges, highlighting the transformative potential of semantic situation in shaping next-generation wireless systems. Our findings not only contribute to the theoretical understanding of spectrum cognition but also offer practical insights for its implementation in real-world scenarios.

Title: Passivity Compensation: A Distributed Approach for Consensus Analysis in Heterogeneous Networks
Authors: Yongkang Su, Sei Zhen Khong, Lanlan Su
Abstract: This paper investigates a passivity-based approach to output consensus analysis in heterogeneous networks composed of non-identical agents coupled via nonlinear interactions, in the presence of measurement and/or communication noise. Focusing on agents that are input-feedforward passive (IFP), we first examine whether a shortage of passivity in some agents can be compensated by a passivity surplus in others, in the sense of preserving the passivity of the transformed open-loop system defined by the agent dynamics and network topology. We show that such compensation is only feasible when at most one agent lacks passivity, and we characterise how this deficit can be offset using the excess passivity within the group of agents. For general networks, we then investigate passivity compensation within the feedback interconnection by leveraging the passivity surplus in the coupling links to locally compensate for the lack of passivity in the adjacent agents. In particular, a distributed condition, expressed in terms of passivity indices and coupling gains, is derived to ensure output consensus of the interconnected network.

Title: Can General-Purpose Omnimodels Compete with Specialists? A Case Study in Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Yizhe Zhang, Qiang Chen, Tao Zhou
Abstract: The emergence of powerful, general-purpose omnimodels capable of processing diverse data modalities has raised a critical question: can these ``jack-of-all-trades'' systems perform on par with highly specialized models in knowledge-intensive domains? This work investigates this question within the high-stakes field of medical image segmentation. We conduct a comparative study analyzing the zero-shot performance of a state-of-the-art omnimodel (Gemini 2.5 Pro, the ``Nano Banana'' model) against domain-specific deep learning models on three distinct tasks: polyp (endoscopy), retinal vessel (fundus), and breast tumor segmentation (ultrasound). Our study focuses on performance at the extremes by curating subsets of the ``easiest'' and ``hardest'' cases based on the specialist models' accuracy. Our findings reveal a nuanced and task-dependent landscape. For polyp and breast tumor segmentation, specialist models excel on easy samples, but the omnimodel demonstrates greater robustness on hard samples where specialists fail catastrophically. Conversely, for the fine-grained task of retinal vessel segmentation, the specialist model maintains superior performance across both easy and hard cases. Intriguingly, qualitative analysis suggests omnimodels may possess higher sensitivity, identifying subtle anatomical features missed by human annotators. Our results indicate that while current omnimodels are not yet a universal replacement for specialists, their unique strengths suggest a potential complementary role with specialist models, particularly in enhancing robustness on challenging edge cases.

Title: Towards Early Detection: AI-Based Five-Year Forecasting of Breast Cancer Risk Using Digital Breast Tomosynthesis Imaging
Authors: Manon A. Dorster, Felix J. Dorfner, Mason C. Cleveland, Melisa S. Guelen, Jay Patel, Dania Daye, Jean-Philippe Thiran, Albert E. Kim, Christopher P. Bridge
Abstract: As early detection of breast cancer strongly favors successful therapeutic outcomes, there is major commercial interest in optimizing breast cancer screening. However, current risk prediction models achieve modest performance and do not incorporate digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) imaging, which was FDA-approved for breast cancer screening in 2011. To address this unmet need, we present a deep learning (DL)-based framework capable of forecasting an individual patient's 5-year breast cancer risk directly from screening DBT. Using an unparalleled dataset of 161,753 DBT examinations from 50,590 patients, we trained a risk predictor based on features extracted using the Meta AI DINOv2 image encoder, combined with a cumulative hazard layer, to assess a patient's likelihood of developing breast cancer over five years. On a held-out test set, our best-performing model achieved an AUROC of 0.80 on predictions within 5 years. These findings reveal the high potential of DBT-based DL approaches to complement traditional risk assessment tools, and serve as a promising basis for additional investigation to validate and enhance our work.

Title: Ultrasound-based detection and malignancy prediction of breast lesions eligible for biopsy: A multi-center clinical-scenario study using nomograms, large language models, and radiologist evaluation

Abstract: To develop and externally validate integrated ultrasound nomograms combining BIRADS features and quantitative morphometric characteristics, and to compare their performance with expert radiologists and state of the art large language models in biopsy recommendation and malignancy prediction for breast lesions. In this retrospective multicenter, multinational study, 1747 women with pathologically confirmed breast lesions underwent ultrasound across three centers in Iran and Turkey. A total of 10 BIRADS and 26 morphological features were extracted from each lesion. A BIRADS, morphometric, and fused nomogram integrating both feature sets was constructed via logistic regression. Three radiologists (one senior, two general) and two ChatGPT variants independently interpreted deidentified breast lesion images. Diagnostic performance for biopsy recommendation (BIRADS 4,5) and malignancy prediction was assessed in internal and two external validation cohorts. In pooled analysis, the fused nomogram achieved the highest accuracy for biopsy recommendation (83.0%) and malignancy prediction (83.8%), outperforming the morphometric nomogram, three radiologists and both ChatGPT models. Its AUCs were 0.901 and 0.853 for the two tasks, respectively. In addition, the performance of the BIRADS nomogram was significantly higher than the morphometric nomogram, three radiologists and both ChatGPT models for biopsy recommendation and malignancy prediction. External validation confirmed the robust generalizability across different ultrasound platforms and populations. An integrated BIRADS morphometric nomogram consistently outperforms standalone models, LLMs, and radiologists in guiding biopsy decisions and predicting malignancy. These interpretable, externally validated tools have the potential to reduce unnecessary biopsies and enhance personalized decision making in breast imaging.

Title: On the Global Optimality of Linear Policies for Sinkhorn Distributionally Robust Linear Quadratic Control
Authors: Riccardo Cescon, Andrea Martin, Giancarlo Ferrari-Trecate
Abstract: The Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) regulator is a cornerstone of optimal control theory, yet its performance can degrade significantly when the noise distributions deviate from the assumed Gaussian model. To address this limitation, this work proposes a distributionally robust generalization of the finite-horizon LQG control problem. Specifically, we assume that the noise distributions are unknown and belong to ambiguity sets defined in terms of an entropy-regularized Wasserstein distance centered at a nominal Gaussian distribution. By deriving novel bounds on this Sinkhorn discrepancy and proving structural and topological properties of the resulting ambiguity sets, we establish global optimality of linear policies. Numerical experiments showcase improved distributional robustness of our control policy.

Title: Lightweight Error-Correction Code Encoders in Superconducting Electronic Systems
Authors: Yerzhan Mustafa, Berker Peköz, Selçuk Köse
Abstract: Data transmission from superconducting electronic circuits, such as single flux quantum (SFQ) logic, to room-temperature electronics is susceptible to bit errors, which may result from flux trapping, fabrication defects, and process parameter variations (PPV). Due to the cooling power budget at 4.2 K and constraints on the chip area, the size of the error-correction code encoders is limited. In this work, three lightweight error-correction code encoders are proposed that are based on Hamming(7,4), Hamming(8,4), and Reed-Muller(1,3) codes and implemented with SFQ logic. The performance of these encoders is analyzed in the presence of PPV. The trade-offs between the theoretical complexity and physical size of error-correction code encoders are identified.

Title: Doubly-Dispersive Continuous MIMO Systems: Channel Modeling and Beamforming Design
Authors: Kuranage Roche Rayan Ranasinghe, Zhaolin Wang, Hyeon Seok Rou, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, Emil Björnson
Abstract: We address the modeling and optimal beamforming (BF) design for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) continuous aperture array (CAPA) systems operating over doubly-dispersive (DD) channels. First, a comprehensive DD continuous MIMO (DDC MIMO) channel model that incorporates CAPAs at both the transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) is derived, which is used to obtain explicit input-output (I/O) relations for various waveforms well suited to integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) and robust to DD channels, namely orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM). Then, functional optimization problems are formulated for the design of TX and RX BF matrices that maximize received power, in which novel low-complexity, closed-form solutions are obtained via the calculus of variations (CoV) method, yielding expressions closely related to the classical matched filter commonly used in conventional MIMO systems. Simulation results confirm that the proposed TX/RX BF designs with CAPAs provide significant performance and computational complexity gains over conventional MIMO systems in DD channels.

Title: Localized Supervised Learning for Cryo-ET Reconstruction
Authors: Vinith Kishore, Valentin Debarnot, AmirEhsan Khorashadizadeh, Ivan Dokmanić
Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET) is a powerful tool in structural biology for 3D visualization of cells and biological systems at resolutions sufficient to identify individual proteins in situ. The measurements are collected by tilting the frozen specimen and exposing it to an electron beam of known dosage. As the biological samples are prone to electron damage, the samples can be exposed to only a limited dosage of electrons, leading to noisy and incomplete measurements. Thus, the reconstructions are noisy and incomplete, leading to the missing wedge problem. Currently, self-supervised learning is used to compensate for this issue. This typically involves, for each volume to recover, training a large 3D UNet on the initial noisy reconstruction, leading to large training time and memory requirements. In this work, we exploit the local nature of the forward model to train a lightweight network using only localized data from the measurements. This design provides flexibility in balancing computational and time requirements while reconstructing the volumes with high accuracy. We observe experimentally that this network can work well on unseen datasets, despite using a network trained on a few measurements.

Title: BSNeRF: Broadband Spectral Neural Radiance Fields for Snapshot Multispectral Light-field Imaging
Authors: Erqi Huang, John Restrepo, Xun Cao, Ivo Ihrke
Abstract: Snapshot Multispectral Light-field Imaging (SMLI) is an emerging computational imaging technique that captures high-dimensional data (x, y, z, $\theta$, $\phi$, $\lambda$) in a single shot using a low-dimensional sensor. The accuracy of high-dimensional data reconstruction depends on representing the spectrum using neural radiance field models, which requires consideration of broadband spectral decoupling during optimization. Currently, some SMLI approaches avoid the challenge of model decoupling by either reducing light-throughput or prolonging imaging time. In this work, we propose a broadband spectral neural radiance field (BSNeRF) for SMLI systems. Experiments show that our model successfully decouples a broadband multiplexed spectrum. Consequently, this approach enhances multispectral light-field image reconstruction and further advances plenoptic imaging.

Title: DRetNet: A Novel Deep Learning Framework for Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis
Authors: Idowu Paul Okuwobi, Jingyuan Liu, Jifeng Wan, Jiaojiao Jiang
Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, necessitating early detection to prevent vision loss. Current automated DR detection systems often struggle with poor-quality images, lack interpretability, and insufficient integration of domain-specific knowledge. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that integrates three innovative contributions: (1) Adaptive Retinal Image Enhancement Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs): this technique dynamically enhances retinal images by incorporating physical constraints, improving the visibility of critical features such as microaneurysms, hemorrhages, and exudates; (2) Hybrid Feature Fusion Network (HFFN): by combining deep learning embeddings with handcrafted features, HFFN leverages both learned representations and domain-specific knowledge to enhance generalization and accuracy; (3) Multi-Stage Classifier with Uncertainty Quantification: this method breaks down the classification process into logical stages, providing interpretable predictions and confidence scores, thereby improving clinical trust. The proposed framework achieves an accuracy of 92.7%, a precision of 92.5%, a recall of 92.6%, an F1-score of 92.5%, an AUC of 97.8%, a mAP of 0.96, and an MCC of 0.85. Ophthalmologists rated the framework's predictions as highly clinically relevant (4.8/5), highlighting its alignment with real-world diagnostic needs. Qualitative analyses, including Grad-CAM visualizations and uncertainty heatmaps, further enhance the interpretability and trustworthiness of the system. The framework demonstrates robust performance across diverse conditions, including low-quality images, noisy data, and unseen datasets. These features make the proposed framework a promising tool for clinical adoption, enabling more accurate and reliable DR detection in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: To enhance the performance of end-to-end (E2E) speech recognition systems in noisy or low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, this paper introduces NoisyD-CT, a novel tri-stage training framework built on the Conformer-Transducer architecture. The core of NoisyD-CT is a especially designed compact noisy disentanglement (NoisyD) module (adding only 1.71M parameters), integrated between the Conformer blocks and Transducer Decoder to perform deep noise suppression and improve ASR robustness in challenging acoustic noise environments. To fully exploit the noise suppression capability of the NoisyD-CT, we further propose a clean representation consistency loss to align high-level representations derived from noisy speech with those obtained from corresponding clean speech. Together with a noisy reconstruction loss, this consistency alignment enables the NoisyD module to effectively suppress noise while preserving essential acoustic and linguistic features consistent across both clean and noisy conditions, thereby producing cleaner internal representations that enhance ASR performance. Moreover, our tri-stage training strategy is designed to fully leverage the functionalities of both the noisy disentanglement and speech recognition modules throughout the model training process, ultimately maximizing performance gains under noisy conditions. Our experiments are performed on the LibriSpeech and CHiME-4 datasets, extensive results demonstrate that our proposed NoisyD-CT significantly outperforms the competitive Conformer-Transducer baseline, achieving up to 25.7% and 10.6% relative word error rate reductions on simulated and real-world noisy test sets, respectively, while maintaining or even improving performance on clean speech test sets.

Title: A Bayesian Framework For Cascaded Channel Estimation in RIS-Aided mmWave Systems
Authors: Gyoseung Lee, Junil Choi
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate cascaded channel estimation for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided millimeter-wave multi-user communication systems. Since the complex channel gains of the cascaded RIS channel are generally non-Gaussian, the use of the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) estimator leads to inevitable performance degradation. To tackle this issue, we propose a variational inference-based framework that approximates the complex channel gains using a complex adaptive Laplace prior, which effectively captures their probability distributions in a tractable way. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed estimator outperforms conventional estimators including least squares and LMMSE in terms of cascaded channel estimation error.

Title: Fluid Antenna Port Prediction based on Large Language Models
Authors: Yali Zhang, Haifan Yin, Weidong Li, Emil Bjornson, Merouane Debbah
Abstract: This study seeks to utilize large language models (LLMs) to forecast the moving ports of fluid antenna (FA). By repositioning the antenna to the locations identified by our proposed model, we intend to address the mobility challenges faced by user equipment (UE). To the best of our knowledge, this paper introduces, for the first time, the application of LLMs in the prediction of FA ports, presenting a novel model termed Port-LLM. The architecture of our model is based on the pre-trained GPT-2 framework. We designed specialized data preprocessing, input embedding, and output projection modules to effectively bridge the disparities between the wireless communication data and the data format utilized by the pre-trained LLM. Simulation results demonstrate that our model exhibits superior predictive performance under different numbers of base station (BS) antennas and varying UE speeds, indicating strong generalization and robustness ability. Furthermore, the spectral efficiency (SE) attained by our model surpasses that achieved by traditional methods in both medium and high-speed mobile environments.

Title: Using Gaussian Mixtures to Model Evolving Multi-Modal Beliefs Across Social Media
Authors: Yijun Chen, Farhad Farokhi, Yutong Bu, Nicholas Kah Yean Low, Jarra Horstman, Julian Greentree, Robin Evans, Andrew Melatos
Abstract: We use Gaussian mixtures to model formation and evolution of multi-modal beliefs and opinion uncertainty across social networks. In this model, opinions evolve by Bayesian belief update when incorporating exogenous factors (signals from outside sources, e.g., news articles) and by non-Bayesian mixing dynamics when incorporating endogenous factors (interactions across social media). The modeling enables capturing the richness of behavior observed in multi-modal opinion dynamics while maintaining interpretability and simplicity of scalar models. We present preliminary results on opinion formation and uncertainty to investigate the effect of stubborn individuals (as social influencers). This leads to a notion of centrality based on the ease with which an individual can disrupt the flow of information across the social network.

Title: Enabling 6G Through Multi-Domain Channel Extrapolation: Opportunities and Challenges of Generative Artificial Intelligence
Authors: Yuan Gao, Zichen Lu, Yifan Wu, Yanliang Jin, Shunqing Zhang, Xiaoli Chu, Shugong Xu, Cheng-Xiang Wang
Abstract: Channel extrapolation has attracted wide attention due to its potential to acquire channel state information (CSI) with high accuracy and minimal overhead. This is becoming increasingly crucial as the sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks aim to support complex scenarios, for example, high-mobility communications utilizing ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technologies and broad spectrum bands, necessitating multi-domain channel extrapolation. Current research predominantly addresses channel extrapolation within a single domain, lacking a comprehensive approach to multi-domain channel extrapolation. To bridge the gap, we propose the concept of multi-domain channel extrapolation, detailing the essential performance requirements for 6G networks. These include precise channel extrapolation, adaptability to varying scenarios, and manageable computational complexity during both training and inference stages. In light of these requirements, we elaborate the potential and challenges of incorporating generative artificial intelligence (GAI)-based models for effective multi-domain channel extrapolation. Given the ability of the Transformer to capture long-range dependencies and hidden patterns, we propose a novel Transformer encoder-like model by eliminating the positional encoding module and replacing the original multi-head attention with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for multi-domain channel extrapolation. Simulation results indicate that this model surpasses existing baseline models in terms of extrapolation accuracy and inference speed. Ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of the module design of the proposed design. Finally, we pose several open questions for the development of practical GAI-based multi-domain channel extrapolation models, including the issues of explainability, generalization, and dataset collection.

Title: A Model-Based Dictionary Approach for Magnetic Nanoparticle Signal Prediction
Authors: Asli Alpman, Mustafa Utkur, Emine Ulku Saritas
Abstract: Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a tracer-based medical imaging modality that enables quantification and spatial mapping of magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) distribution. The magnetization response of MNPs depends on experimental conditions such as drive field (DF) settings and medium viscosity, as well as on magnetic parameters of MNPs such as magnetic core diameter, hydrodynamic diameter, and magnetic anisotropy constant. A comprehensive understanding of the magnetization response of MNPs can facilitate the optimization of DF and MNP type for a given MPI application, without the need for extensive experimentation. In this work, we propose a calibration-free iterative algorithm using model-based dictionaries for MNP signal prediction at untested settings. Dictionaries were constructed with the MNP signals simulated using the coupled Brown-Néel rotation model. Based on the available measurements, the proposed algorithm jointly estimates the dictionary weights and the transfer functions due to non-model-based dynamics. These dynamics include the system response of the measurement setup as well as magnetization dynamics not accounted for by the employed coupled Brown-Néel rotation model. The algorithm was first validated on synthetic signals at SNR levels of 1 and 10, and then tested on an in-house MPS setup across six viscosity levels (0.89-15.33 mPa.s) and DF frequencies of 0.25-2 kHz using two commercial MNPs. Validation on synthetic signals showed accurate weight and transfer function estimation even at SNR 1. MPS experiments demonstrated successful prediction of MNP signals at untested viscosities, with NRMSE below 1.51% and 3.5% for the two tested MNPs across all DF settings. Predicted signals captured viscosity dependent trends, and NWD values remained low (<0.10 and <0.07 for the two tested MNPs), confirming robust weight estimation.

Title: Dynamic State Estimation of Power System Utilizing Cauchy Kernel-Based Maximum Mixture Correntropy UKF over Beluga Whale-Bat Optimization
Authors: Duc Viet Nguyen, Haiquan Zhao, Jinhui Hu
Abstract: Non-Gaussian noise, outliers, sudden load changes, and bad measurement data are key factors that diminish the accuracy of dynamic state estimation in power systems. Additionally, unscented Kalman filters (UKF) based on correntropy criteria utilize bandwidth-sensitive Gaussian kernels, which may lead to singular matrices in the Cholesky decomposition. To overcome all the above problems, in this paper, a robust UKF based on Cauchy kernel maximum mixture correntropy (CKMMC) criteria over hybrid Beluga Whale-Bat (BWB) optimization (BWB-CKMMC-UKF) is proposed, in which the kernel is merged of two Cauchy functions. Specifically, the measurement error and state error are unified in the cost function by the statistical linearization technique, and the optimal value of state estimation is obtained by fixed-point iteration. Because of its insensitive feature to kernel bandwidth and notable thick-tailed feature, the Cauchy kernel function is utilized instead of the Gaussian kernel in the optimization criteria. Additionally, to fit the power system model, the shape coefficients of the kernel in the CKMMC criterion and scale coefficients that influence the selection of sigma points in the unscented transform are determined based on the BWB algorithm. Simulation results on IEEE 14, 30, and 57-bus test systems validated the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Title: Beyond Exhaustive Sampling: Efficient Rotational Matching via Ball Harmonics
Authors: Fabian Kruse, Vinith Kishore, Valentin Debarnot, Ivan Dokmanić
Abstract: Cryo-ET allows to generate tomograms of biological samples in situ, capturing complex structures in their native context. Despite low signal-to-noise ratio in reconstructed volumes, the large number of copies of the same macromolecules makes it possible to retrieve high-resolution maps by averaging many aligned subtomograms. To keep up with technical advances in the imaging process and the resulting huge amounts of data available, there is a need for scalable, fast and robust procedures to align subtomograms. We propose a subtomogram alignment framework based on the ball harmonics expansion that combines frequency- and gradient-based optimization strategies to avoid exhaustive rotation sampling, enabling a speed-up of an order of magnitude compared to current approaches.

Title: Enhanced Fingerprint-based Positioning With Practical Imperfections: Deep learning-based approaches
Authors: Shugong Xu, Jun Jiang, Wenjun Yu, Yilin Gao, Guangjin Pan, Shiyi Mu, Zhiqi Ai, Yuan Gao, Peigang Jiang, Cheng-Xiang Wang
Abstract: High-precision positioning is vital for cellular networks to support innovative applications such as extended reality, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and industrial Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Existing positioning algorithms using deep learning techniques require vast amounts of labeled data, which are difficult to obtain in real-world cellular environments, and these models often struggle to generalize effectively. To advance cellular positioning techniques, the 2024 Wireless Communication Algorithm Elite Competition as conducted, which provided a dataset from a three-sector outdoor cellular system, incorporating practical challenges such as limited labeled-dataset, dynamic wireless environments within the target and unevenly-spaced anchors, Our team developed three innovative positioning frameworks that swept the top three awards of this competition, namely the semi-supervised framework with consistency, ensemble learning-based algorithm and decoupled mapping heads-based algorithm. Specifically, the semi-supervised framework with consistency effectively generates high-quality pseudo-labels, enlarging the labeled-dataset for model training. The ensemble learning-based algorithm amalgamates the positioning coordinates from models trained under different strategies, effectively combating the dynamic positioning environments. The decoupled mapping heads-based algorithm utilized sector rotation scheme to resolve the uneven-spaced anchor issue. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed positioning algorithms compared to existing benchmarks in terms of the {90%, 80%, 67%, 50%} percentile and mean distance error.

Abstract: As Industry 4.0 progresses, flexible manufacturing has become a cornerstone of modern industrial systems, with equipment automation playing a pivotal role. However, existing control software for industrial equipment, typically reliant on graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that require human interactions such as mouse clicks or screen touches, poses significant barriers to the adoption of code-based equipment automation. Recently, Large Language Model-based General Computer Control (LLM-GCC) has emerged as a promising approach to automate GUI-based operations. However, industrial settings pose unique challenges, including visually diverse, domain-specific interfaces and mission-critical tasks demanding high precision. This paper introduces IndusGCC, the first dataset and benchmark tailored to LLM-GCC in industrial environments, encompassing 448 real-world tasks across seven domains, from robotic arm control to production line configuration. IndusGCC features multimodal human interaction data with the equipment software, providing robust supervision for GUI-level code generation. Additionally, we propose a novel evaluation framework with functional and structural metrics to assess LLM-generated control scripts. Experimental results on mainstream LLMs demonstrate both the potential of LLM-GCC and the challenges it faces, establishing a strong foundation for future research toward fully automated factories.

Title: Rigid Body Localization and Tracking for 6G V2X: Algorithms, Applications, and Road to Adoption
Authors: Niclas Führling, Hyeon Seok Rou, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, David González G., Gonzalo Seco-Granados, Osvaldo Gonsa
Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) perception refers to a suite of technologies that empower vehicles to sense their environment and communicate with other entities, including surrounding vehicles, infrastructure, and cloud/edge networks. With the growing demands of autonomous driving, V2X perception has gained significant attention, particularly through the emergence of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) frameworks. Within this landscape, rigid body localization (RBL) has emerged as a promising paradigm, enabling the estimation of not only the position and velocity of the targets, but also its three-dimensional (3D) geometric structure and orientation. This article introduces the concept of RBL, highlights its unique advantages and applications, identifies key technical challenges, and finally outlines future research directions. In addition, the potential of RBL in next-generation - e.g. beyond fifth generation (B5G) and sixth-generation (6G) - wireless systems applied to V2X perception is also discussed, with a focus on its role in standardization efforts and its relevance across automotive and industrial domains.

Title: High-Density MIMO Localization Using a 32x64 Ultrasonic Transducer-Microphone Array with Real-Time Data Streaming
Authors: Rens Baeyens, Dennis Laurijssen, Jan Steckel, Walter Daems
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel ultrasonic array system designed for high-precision localization using a large-scale MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) architecture. The system combines 32 transmitters with 62 microphones, creating an extended virtual aperture that improves channel separability and spatial resolution. Each transmitter is excited by a random-phase multisine within the ultrasonic band, which reduces inter-channel correlation and increases robustness against multipath. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated through simulations of reflector imaging and analysis of channel separation under realistic transducer bandwidth constraints. Results show that MIMO processing enables improved separation of reflectors compared to single-emitter configurations, although practical limitations such as transducer bandwidth reduce the achievable channel isolation.

Title: nRTIS: Low-Cost Real-Time 3D Sonar Imaging Circular Array Supporting Beamforming for Industrial Applications
Authors: Rens Baeyens, Dennis Laurijssen, Jan Steckel, Walter Daems
Abstract: Conventional ultrasonic inspection systems rely on phased arrays and high-performance computing hardware, making them costly, bulky, and unsuitable for portable or embedded use. In this work, we present nRTIS (nano Real-Time 3D Imaging Sonar), a compact ultrasonic sensing platform built around a circular array of MEMS microphones and a central ultrasonic transducer. The device achieves real-time acquisition through an RP2350 microcontroller and high-speed USB transfer. We validate the system using both simulations and controlled experiments: point spread function (PSF) simulations demonstrate beamforming resolution and sidelobe suppression, while reflector measurements confirm robust data acquisition. These results highlight the potential of nRTIS for scalable industrial applications such as weld inspection, pipe mapping, and robotic navigation.

Abstract: Medical image registration is critical for clinical applications, and fair benchmarking of different methods is essential for monitoring ongoing progress. To date, the Learn2Reg 2020-2023 challenges have released several complementary datasets and established metrics for evaluations. However, these editions did not capture all aspects of the registration problem, particularly in terms of modality diversity and task complexity. To address these limitations, the 2024 edition introduces three new tasks, including large-scale multi-modal registration and unsupervised inter-subject brain registration, as well as the first microscopy-focused benchmark within Learn2Reg. The new datasets also inspired new method developments, including invertibility constraints, pyramid features, keypoints alignment and instance optimisation.

Title: Rate Optimization for Downlink URLLC via Pinching Antenna Arrays
Authors: Tong Lin, Jianyue Zhu, Wei Huang, Meng Hua, Zhizhong Zhang
Abstract: This work studies an ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (uRLLC) downlink system using pinching antennas which are realized by activating small dielectric particles along a dielectric waveguide. Our goal is to maximize the data rate by optimizing the positions of the pinching antennas. By proposing a compact and cost-efficient antenna architecture and formulating a finite blocklength-based optimization model, we derive a closed-form solution for the optimal antenna placement under quality-of-service (QoS) and antenna spacing constraints. Meanwhile, a phase-alignment strategy is integrated into the design, enabling coherent signal superposition across the array. Simulation results confirm significant rate improvements over conventional antenna systems while satisfying uRLLC requirements, making the proposed design well-suited for compact and latency-critical future applications.

Title: SMDS-based Rigid Body Localization
Authors: Niclas Führling, Giuseppe Abreu, David González G., Osvaldo Gonsa
Abstract: We consider a novel rigid body localization (RBL) method, based only on a set of measurements of the distances, as well as the angles between sensors of the vehicle to the anchor landmark points. A key point of the proposed method is to use a variation of the super multidimensional scaling (SMDS) algorithm, where only a minor part of the complex edge kernel is used, based on the available information, which in the case of RBL is anchor-to-anchor and target-to-target information. Simulation results illustrate the good performance of the proposed technique in terms of mean square error (MSE) of the estimates, compared also to the corresponding Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB).

Title: Design, Modelling and Analysis of a Bio-inspired Spiking Temperature Regulator
Authors: J.M. Rosito, E. Petri, E. Steur, W.P.M.H. Heemels
Abstract: In biology, homeostasis is the process of maintaining a stable internal environment, which is crucial for optimal functioning of organisms. One of the key homeostatic mechanisms is thermoregulation that allows the organism to maintain its core temperature within tight bounds despite being exposed to a wide range of varying external temperatures. Instrumental in thermoregulation is the presence of thermosensitive neurons at multiple places throughout the body, including muscles, the spinal cord, and the brain, which provide spiking sensory signals for the core temperature. In response to these signals, thermoeffectors are activated, creating a negative spiking feedback loop. Additionally, a feedforward signal is provided by warmth and cold-sensitive neurons in the skin, offering a measure for the external temperature. This paper presents an electronic circuit-based architecture design to replicate the biological process of thermoregulation, combined with a formal mathematical analysis. The considered architecture consists of four temperature sensitive neurons and a single actuator, configured in a negative feedback loop with feedforward control. To model the overall system mathematically, hybrid dynamical system descriptions are proposed that are used to analyze and simulate the performance of the design. The analysis and numerical case study illustrate the crucial role of feedforward control in reducing the dependency on the external temperature.

Title: Comparison between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning in Deep Unfolded Sparse Signal Recovery
Authors: Koshi Nagahisa, Ryo Hayakawa, Youji Iiguni
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of loss function selection in deep unfolding techniques for sparse signal recovery algorithms. Deep unfolding transforms iterative optimization algorithms into trainable lightweight neural networks by unfolding their iterations as network layers, with various loss functions employed for parameter learning depending on application contexts. We focus on deep unfolded versions of the fundamental iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (ISTA) and the iterative hard thresholding algorithm (IHT), comparing supervised learning using mean squared error with unsupervised learning using the objective function of the original optimization problem. Our simulation results reveal that the effect of the choice of loss function significantly depends on the convexity of the optimization problem. For convex $\ell_1$-regularized problems, supervised-ISTA achieves better final recovery accuracy but fails to minimize the original objective function, whereas we empirically observe that unsupervised-ISTA converges to a nearly identical solution as conventional ISTA but with accelerated convergence. Conversely, for nonconvex $\ell_0$-regularized problems, both supervised-IHT and unsupervised-IHT converge to better local minima than the original IHT, showing similar performance regardless of the loss function employed. These findings provide valuable insights into the design of effective deep unfolded networks for sparse signal recovery applications.

Title: Energy-optimal control of discrete-time port-Hamiltonian systems
Authors: Arijit Sarkar, Vaibhav Kumar Singh, Manuel Schaller, Karl Worthmann
Abstract: In this letter, we study the energy-optimal control of nonlinear port-Hamiltonian (pH) systems in discrete time. For continuous-time pH systems, energy-optimal control problems are strictly dissipative by design. This property, stating that the system to be optimized is dissipative with the cost functional as a supply rate, implies a stable long-term behavior of optimal solutions and enables stability results in predictive control. In this work, we show that the crucial property of strict dissipativity is not straightforwardly preserved by any energy-preserving integrator such as the implicit midpoint rule. Then, we prove that discretizations via difference and differential representations lead to strictly dissipative discrete-time optimal control problems. Consequently, we rigorously show a stable long-term behavior of optimal solutions in the form of a manifold (subspace) turnpike property. Finally, we validate our findings using two numerical examples

Title: Data-Driven Fault Isolation in Linear Time-Invariant Systems: A Subspace Classification Approach
Authors: Mohammad Amin Sheikhi, Gabriel de Albuquerque Gleizer, Peyman Mohajerin Esfahani, Tamás Keviczky
Abstract: We study the problem of fault isolation in linear systems with actuator and sensor faults within a data-driven framework. We propose a nullspace-based filter that uses solely fault-free input-output data collected under process and measurement noises. By reparameterizing the problem within a behavioral framework, we achieve a direct fault isolation filter design that is independent of any explicit system model. The underlying classification problem is approached from a geometric perspective, enabling a characterization of mutual fault discernibility in terms of fundamental system properties given a noise-free setting. In addition, the provided conditions can be evaluated using only the available data. Finally, a simulation study is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: ConamArray: A 32-Element Broadband MEMS Ultrasound Transducer Array
Authors: Dennis Laurijssen, Rens Baeyens, Walter Daems, Jan Steckel
Abstract: This paper presents the ConamArray, a compact broadband ultrasound transducer array composed of 32 MEMS loudspeakers. Unlike conventional broadband transducers, which are typically large and require high driving voltages, the proposed array combines small form factor MEMS devices in a staggered two-row configuration to enable beam steering across a wide ultrasonic band. A dual-microcontroller back-end with synchronized multi-DAC outputs provides flexible waveform generation and runtime steering control. Both simulations and anechoic chamber measurements demonstrate that the ConamArray achieves stable beam steering, while also revealing the onset of grating lobes when steering to larger angles. These results confirm the feasibility of broadband beam steering using MEMS technology, opening new opportunities for applications in ultrasonic imaging, localization, and bio-inspired robotics.

Title: End-to-End Low-Level Neural Control of an Industrial-Grade 6D Magnetic Levitation System
Authors: Philipp Hartmann, Jannick Stranghöner, Klaus Neumann
Abstract: Magnetic levitation is poised to revolutionize industrial automation by integrating flexible in-machine product transport and seamless manipulation. It is expected to become the standard drive for automated manufacturing. However, controlling such systems is inherently challenging due to their complex, unstable dynamics. Traditional control approaches, which rely on hand-crafted control engineering, typically yield robust but conservative solutions, with their performance closely tied to the expertise of the engineering team. In contrast, neural control learning presents a promising alternative. This paper presents the first neural controller for 6D magnetic levitation. Trained end-to-end on interaction data from a proprietary controller, it directly maps raw sensor data and 6D reference poses to coil current commands. The neural controller can effectively generalize to previously unseen situations while maintaining accurate and robust control. These results underscore the practical feasibility of learning-based neural control in complex physical systems and suggest a future where such a paradigm could enhance or even substitute traditional engineering approaches in demanding real-world applications. The trained neural controller, source code, and demonstration videos are publicly available at this https URL.

Title: MixedG2P-T5: G2P-free Speech Synthesis for Mixed-script texts using Speech Self-Supervised Learning and Language Model
Authors: Joonyong Park, Daisuke Saito, Nobuaki Minematsu
Abstract: This study presents a novel approach to voice synthesis that can substitute the traditional grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion by using a deep learning-based model that generates discrete tokens directly from speech. Utilizing a pre-trained voice SSL model, we train a T5 encoder to produce pseudo-language labels from mixed-script texts (e.g., containing Kanji and Kana). This method eliminates the need for manual phonetic transcription, reducing costs and enhancing scalability, especially for large non-transcribed audio datasets. Our model matches the performance of conventional G2P-based text-to-speech systems and is capable of synthesizing speech that retains natural linguistic and paralinguistic features, such as accents and intonations.

Title: A James-Stein Estimator based Generalized OMP Algorithm for Robust Signal Recovery using Sparse Representation
Authors: Debraj Banerjee, Amitava Chatterjee
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm named JS-gOMP, which enhances the generalized Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (gOMP) algorithm for improved noise robustness in sparse signal processing. The JS-gOMP algorithm uniquely incorporates the James-Stein estimator, optimizing the trade-off between signal recovery and noise suppression. This modification addresses the challenges posed by noise in the dictionary, a common issue in sparse representation scenarios. Comparative analyses demonstrate that JS-gOMP outperforms traditional gOMP, especially in noisy environments, offering a more effective solution for signal and image processing applications where noise presence is significant.

Title: Characterization of Speech Similarity Between Australian Aboriginal and High-Resource Languages: A Case Study on Dharawal
Authors: Ting Dang, Trini Manoj Jeyaseelan, Eliathamby Ambikairajah, Vidhyasaharan Sethu
Abstract: Australian Aboriginal languages are of significant cultural and linguistic value but remain severely underrepresented in modern speech AI systems. While state-of-the-art speech foundation models and automatic speech recognition excel in high-resource settings, they often struggle to generalize to low-resource languages, especially those lacking clean, annotated speech data. In this work, we collect and clean a speech dataset for Dharawal, a low-resource Australian Aboriginal language, by carefully sourcing and processing publicly available recordings. Using this dataset, we analyze the speech similarity between Dharawal and 107 high-resource languages using a pre-trained multilingual speech encoder. Our approach combines (1) misclassification rate analysis to assess language confusability, and (2) fine-grained similarity measurements using cosine similarity and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) in the embedding space. Experimental results reveal that Dharawal shares strong speech similarity with languages such as Latin, Māori, Korean, Thai, and Welsh. These findings offer practical guidance for future transfer learning and model adaptation efforts, and underscore the importance of data collection and embedding-based analysis in supporting speech technologies for endangered language communities.

Title: Temporal Representation Learning for Real-Time Ultrasound Analysis
Authors: Yves Stebler, Thomas M. Sutter, Ece Ozkan, Julia E. Vogt
Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging is a critical tool in medical diagnostics, offering real-time visualization of physiological processes. One of its major advantages is its ability to capture temporal dynamics, which is essential for assessing motion patterns in applications such as cardiac monitoring, fetal development, and vascular imaging. Despite its importance, current deep learning models often overlook the temporal continuity of ultrasound sequences, analyzing frames independently and missing key temporal dependencies. To address this gap, we propose a method for learning effective temporal representations from ultrasound videos, with a focus on echocardiography-based ejection fraction (EF) estimation. EF prediction serves as an ideal case study to demonstrate the necessity of temporal learning, as it requires capturing the rhythmic contraction and relaxation of the heart. Our approach leverages temporally consistent masking and contrastive learning to enforce temporal coherence across video frames, enhancing the model's ability to represent motion patterns. Evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, our method achieves a substantial improvement in EF prediction accuracy, highlighting the importance of temporally-aware representation learning for real-time ultrasound analysis.

Title: Semantic Technologies in Practical Demand Response: An Informational Requirement-based Roadmap
Authors: Ozan Baris Mulayim, Yuvraj Agarwal, Mario Bergés, Steve Schaefer, Mitali Shah, Derek Supple
Abstract: The future grid will be highly complex and decentralized, requiring sophisticated coordination across numerous human and software agents that manage distributed resources such as Demand Response (DR). Realizing this vision demands significant advances in semantic interoperability, which enables scalable and cost-effective automation across heterogeneous systems. While semantic technologies have progressed in commercial building and DR domains, current ontologies have two critical limitations: they are often developed without a formal framework that reflects real-world DR requirements, and proposals for integrating general and application-specific ontologies remain mostly conceptual, lacking formalization or empirical validation. In this paper, we address these gaps by applying a formal ontology evaluation/development approach to define the informational requirements (IRs) necessary for semantic interoperability in the area of incentive-based DR for commercial buildings. We identify the IRs associated with each stage of the wholesale incentive-based DR process, focusing on the perspective of building owners. Using these IRs, we evaluate how well existing ontologies (Brick, DELTA, and EFOnt) support the operational needs of DR participation. Our findings reveal substantial misalignments between current ontologies and practical DR requirements. Based on our assessments, we propose a roadmap of necessary extensions and integrations for these ontologies. This work ultimately aims to enhance the interoperability of today's and future smart grid, thereby facilitating scalable integration of DR systems into the grid's complex operational framework.

Title: High-resolution single-pixel imaging in real time with iterative or deep learning-based reconstruction enhancement
Authors: Anna Pastuszczak, Rafał Stojek, Piotr Wróbel, Magdalena Cwojdzińska, Kacper Sobczak, Rafał Kotyński
Abstract: We introduce a compressive single-pixel imaging (SPI) framework for high-resolution image capture in fractions of a second. This framework combines a dedicated sampling strategy with a tailored reconstruction method to enable high-quality imaging of spatially sparse scenes at the native 1024x768 resolution of a digital micromirror device (DMD). The reconstruction process consists of two phases: first, the measured data is processed using the generalized inverse of the measurement matrix for quick image recovery. Then, the spatial sparsity of the scene is leveraged to enhance reconstruction in dense areas, using either an iterative method or a neural network-based approach. With a compression ratio of 0.41% and an image acquisition rate of 6.8 Hz at 22 kHz DMD operation, this framework supports real-time, high-resolution dynamic imaging with the reconstruction that matches the acquisition rate on a mid-tier desktop GPU.

Title: To Share, or Not to Share: A Study on GEO-LEO Systems for IoT Services with Random Access
Authors: Marcel Grec, Federico Clazzer, Israel Leyva-Mayorga, Andrea Munari, Gianluigi Liva, Petar Popovski
Abstract: The increasing number of satellite deployments, both in the low and geostationary Earth orbit exacerbates the already ongoing scarcity of wireless resources when targeting ubiquitous connectivity. For the aim of supporting a massive number of IoT devices characterized by bursty traffic and modern variants of random access, we pose the following question: Should competing satellite operators share spectrum resources or is an exclusive allocation preferable? This question is addressed by devising a communication model for two operators which serve overlapping coverage areas with independent IoT services. Analytical approximations, validated by Monte Carlo simulations, reveal that spectrum sharing can yield significant throughput gains for both operators under certain conditions tied to the relative serviced user populations and coding rates in use. These gains are sensitive also to the system parameters and may not always render the spectral coexistence mutually advantageous.

Title: Targeted-Subharmonic-Eliminating Pulse Density Modulation for Wireless Power Transfer System
Authors: Songyan Li, Hongchang Li
Abstract: This letter proposes a targeted-subharmonic-eliminating pulse density modulation (TSE-PDM) method for SS- compensated WPT systems. By designing a noise transfer function with notch characteristics, the subharmonic components which excite current abnormal oscillations were eliminated. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the TSE-PDM in suppressing current abnormal oscillations. The proposed method is easy to implement in either primary or secondary side of the WPT system and exhibits a certain tolerance to deviations in NTF design, representing the most straightforward method for abnormal oscillation suppression in PDM controlled WPT systems.

Title: Non-Identical Diffusion Models in MIMO-OFDM Channel Generation
Authors: Yuzhi Yang, Omar Alhussein, Mérouane Debbah
Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion model, termed the non-identical diffusion model, and investigate its application to wireless orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) channel generation. Unlike the standard diffusion model that uses a scalar-valued time index to represent the global noise level, we extend this notion to an element-wise time indicator to capture local error variations more accurately. Non-identical diffusion enables us to characterize the reliability of each element (e.g., subcarriers in OFDM) within the noisy input, leading to improved generation results when the initialization is biased. Specifically, we focus on the recovery of wireless multi-input multi-output (MIMO) OFDM channel matrices, where the initial channel estimates exhibit highly uneven reliability across elements due to the pilot scheme. Conventional time embeddings, which assume uniform noise progression, fail to capture such variability across pilot schemes and noise levels. We introduce a matrix that matches the input size to control element-wise noise progression. Following a similar diffusion procedure to existing methods, we show the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed non-identical diffusion scheme both theoretically and numerically. For MIMO-OFDM channel generation, we propose a dimension-wise time embedding strategy. We also develop and evaluate multiple training and generation methods and compare them through numerical experiments.

Title: Grid congestion stymies climate benefit from U.S. vehicle electrification
Authors: Chao Duan, Adilson E. Motter
Abstract: Averting catastrophic global warming requires decisive action to decarbonize key sectors. Vehicle electrification, alongside renewable energy integration, is a long-term strategy toward zero carbon emissions. However, transitioning to fully renewable electricity may take decades -- during which electric vehicles may still rely on carbon-intensive electricity. We analyze the critical role of the transmission network in enabling or constraining emissions reduction from U.S. vehicle electrification. Our models reveal that the available transmission capacity severely limits potential CO2 emissions reduction. With adequate transmission, full electrification could nearly eliminate vehicle operational CO2 emissions once renewable generation reaches the existing nonrenewable capacity. In contrast, the current grid would support only a fraction of that benefit. Achieving the full emissions reduction potential of vehicle electrification during this transition will require a moderate but targeted increase in transmission capacity. Our findings underscore the pressing need to enhance transmission infrastructure to unlock the climate benefits of large-scale electrification and renewable integration.

Title: Predictive Communications for Low-Altitude Networks
Authors: Junting Chen, Bowen Li, Hao Sun, Shuguang Cui, Nikolaos Pappas
Abstract: The emergence of dense, mission-driven aerial networks supporting the low-altitude economy presents unique communication challenges, including extreme channel dynamics and severe cross-tier interference. Traditional reactive communication paradigms are ill-suited to these environments, as they fail to leverage the network's inherent predictability. This paper introduces predictive communication, a novel paradigm transforming network management from reactive adaptation to proactive optimization. The approach is enabled by fusing predictable mission trajectories with stable, large-scale radio environment models (e.g., radio maps). Specifically, we present a hierarchical framework that decomposes the predictive cross-layer resource allocation problem into three layers: strategic (routing), tactical (timing), and operational (power). This structure aligns decision-making timescales with the accuracy levels and ranges of available predictive information. We demonstrate that this foresight-driven framework achieves an order-of-magnitude reduction in cross-tier interference, laying the groundwork for robust and scalable low-altitude communication systems.

Title: A Novel Tunable Controller for Grid Forming Converters towards Critical Services Application
Authors: Yangyadatta Tripathy, Barjeev Tyagi
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the key features of a control system applicable to inverter-based resources (IBR), which is based on grid-forming technology. Such resources are classified as grid-forming or grid-following converters based on the type of output with or without grid connection. With rapid growth in the energy sector to adopt carbon-free generation, Grid Forming Converter (GFC) seems suitable for power provision to remote or islanded operation of converters. A fully-fledged bulk power grid based on GFC requires complex control implementation with suitable tuning of its parameters. In this article a broader analysis of synchronous machine and such type of converter is discussed and designed in the MATLAB 2024 environment with its control technique is studied for a closed-loop system under contingencies. A proposed control scheme is developed to understand the frequency minimization problem and the minimization problem is solved using GAMS programming tool. The primary objective function is found to be suitable for minimization of frequency deviation using a mixed control approach. An artificial neural network-based controller is also proposed with Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm which augments the research by finding suitable optimal reference for GFM converter in the presence of a grid. A long-short-term memory (LSTM) based network is also proposed for the above control and the performance is found to be efficacious.

Title: A Mathematical Model of Hybrid Microgrid With Pole Placement Controller Using State Feedback For Stability Improvement
Authors: Yangyadatta Tripathy, Barjeev Tyagi
Abstract: This paper presents the development of a mathematical model of a converter state space model for a hybrid microgrid. The hybrid model combines the models of components such as DC-Converters, DC-AC converters, and their individual controllers, as well as loads. The input to the converter is considered a constant DC voltage, assumed to originate from distributed generations like solar, battery storage, or fuel-cells. The converter output is connected to a DC line through an LCL filter. The controller circuitry is designed to regulate the voltage, current, and power from the converter. Sensors are strategically placed to measure the currents, voltages, and power, and calculate the reference pulse signal using PWM for the switch. Similarly, the DC-AC converter is modeled. In the state space domain the converter models is used to design overall microgrid system. A single DC converter has six states and two inputs, with all states as outputs. A single DC-AC converter has thirteen states and three inputs, with all states as outputs. Three such converters of each type are considered to develop the DC microgrid and AC microgrid, which are then combined using mathematical analysis to model a hybrid microgrid. For the hybrid microgrid development, network and load models were also included. Eigenvalue analysis has been conducted to study the small signal stability of the considered system. The complete state space model of the hybrid microgrid has been programmed, and a pole-placement controller has been designed to enhance the stability of the system.

Title: High-Performance Trajectory Tracking MPC for Quadcopters with Coupled Time-Varying Constraints and Stability Proofs
Authors: Maedeh Izadi, A.T.J.R. Cobbenhagen, R.L. Sommer, A.R.P. Andrien, E. Lefeber, W.P.M.H. Heemels
Abstract: In this paper, we present a cascade control structure to address the trajectory tracking problem for quadcopters, ensuring uniform global asymptotic stability of the state tracking error dynamics. An MPC strategy based on a 12-dimensional prediction model is proposed for the outer loop, explicitly accounting for time-varying coupled constraints, where multiple variables are interdependent and need to be handled together. The outer-loop controller generates an acceleration reference, which is then converted into attitude and angular velocity references, later tracked by a nonlinear inner-loop controller. Numerical simulations validate the approach, demonstrating enhanced performance in precise and fast tracking by imposing less conservative constraints than existing approaches, while still guaranteeing stability.

Title: Impact of Passive Element Technological Limits on CMOS Low-Noise Amplifier Design
Authors: J. L. González, R. L. Moreno, D. Vázquez
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of technological constraints on passive elements in the design of inductively degenerated CMOS low-noise amplifiers (LNAs). A theoretical analysis is combined with circuit simulations in a 130-nm CMOS process at 2.45~GHz to explore how the available inductance and capacitance values limit key design objectives such as maximum gain, minimum power consumption, and transistor sizing. Results show that these limits significantly restrict the achievable design space, particularly for low-power implementations, and highlight the need to incorporate detailed passive-element models into RF integrated circuit design flows.

Title: Maximally Resilient Controllers under Temporal Logic Specifications
Authors: Youssef Ait Si, Ratnangshu Das, Negar Monir, Sadegh Soudjani, Pushpak Jagtap, Adnane Saoud
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the notion of resilience of a dynamical system, defined by the maximum disturbance a controlled dynamical system can withstand while satisfying given temporal logic specifications. Given a dynamical system and a specification, the objective is to synthesize the controller such that the closed-loop system satisfies this specification while maximizing its resilience. The problem is formulated as a robust optimization program where the objective is to compute the maximum resilience while simultaneously synthesizing the corresponding controller parameters. For linear systems and linear controllers, exact solutions are provided for the class of time-varying polytopic specifications. For the case of nonlinear systems, nonlinear controllers and more general specifications, we leverage tools from the scenario optimization approach, offering a probabilistic guarantee of the solution as well as computational feasibility. Different case studies are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.

Title: AHAMask: Reliable Task Specification for Large Audio Language Models without Instructions
Authors: Yiwei Guo, Bohan Li, Hankun Wang, Zhihan Li, Shuai Wang, Xie Chen, Kai Yu
Abstract: Although current large audio language models (LALMs) extend text large language models (LLMs) with generic acoustic understanding abilities, they usually suffer from instruction sensitivity, where different instructions of the same intention can yield drastically different outcomes. In this work, we propose AHAMask, where we simply mask some of the attention heads in the decoder-only LLM backbone of LALMs, to trigger specific acoustic task functionalities without instructions. These masks are efficiently obtained by training on an LALM, with the number of trainable parameters equal to the attention head count in its LLM backbone. We show by experiments that applying such selective attention head masks achieves comparable or even better performance than using instructions, either on single or composite tasks. Besides achieving reliable acoustic task specification for LALMs, this also reveals that LALMs exhibit certain "functional pathways" in their attention heads.

Title: Leveraging Orbital Dynamics with RF Signal Features for Satellite Multi-Orbit Proximity Threat Detection
Authors: Anouar Boumeftah, Gunes Karabulut Kurt
Abstract: Proximity-based interference is a growing threat to satellite communications, driven by dense multi-orbit constellations and increasingly agile adversarial maneuvers. We propose a hybrid simulation framework that integrates orbital maneuver modeling with RF signal degradation analysis to detect and classify suspicious proximity operations. Using the open-source Maneuver Detection Data Generation (MaDDG) library from MIT Lincoln Laboratory, we generate labeled datasets combining impulsive maneuver profiles with radio-frequency (RF) impacts across a range of behavioral intents: routine station-keeping, covert shadowing, and overt jamming. Our approach fuses kinematic features such as range, velocity, acceleration, and Time of Closest Approach (TCA), with RF metrics including Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), throughput, and Jammer-to-Signal Ratio (JSR). These features are further enhanced with temporal derivatives and rolling-window statistics to capture subtle or transient interference patterns. A Random Forest classifier trained on this fused feature set achieves 94.67% accuracy and a macro F1 score of 0.9471, outperforming models using only kinematic or RF inputs. The system is particularly effective in detecting covert threats, such as surveillance or intermittent jamming, that evade RF-only methods.

Title: Nonlinear Model Predictive Control-Based Reverse Path-Planning and Path-Tracking Control of a Vehicle with Trailer System
Authors: Xincheng Cao, Haochong Chen, Bilin Aksun-Guvenc, Levent Guvenc, Brian Link, Peter J Richmond, Dokyung Yim, Shihong Fan, John Harber
Abstract: Reverse parking maneuvers of a vehicle with trailer system is a challenging task to complete for human drivers due to the unstable nature of the system and unintuitive controls required to orientate the trailer properly. This paper hence proposes an optimization-based automation routine to handle the path-planning and path-tracking control process of such type of maneuvers. The proposed approach utilizes nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to robustly guide the vehicle-trailer system into the desired parking space, and an optional forward repositioning maneuver can be added as an additional stage of the parking process to obtain better system configurations, before backward motion can be attempted again to get a good final pose. The novelty of the proposed approach is the simplicity of its formulation, as the path-planning and path-tracking operations are only conducted on the trailer being viewed as a standalone vehicle, before the control inputs are propagated to the tractor vehicle via inverse kinematic relationships also derived in this paper. Simulation case studies and hardware-in-the-loop tests are performed, and the results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

Title: Computation of Feasible Assume-Guarantee Contracts: A Resilience-based Approach
Authors: Negar Monir, Youssef Ait Si, Ratnangshu Das, Pushpak Jagtap, Adnane Saoud, Sadegh Soudjani
Abstract: We propose a resilience-based framework for computing feasible assume-guarantee contracts that ensure the satisfaction of temporal specifications in interconnected discrete-time systems. Interconnection effects are modeled as structured disturbances. We use a resilience metric, the maximum disturbance under which local specifications hold, to refine assumptions and guarantees across subsystems iteratively. For two subsystems, we demonstrate correctness, monotone refinement of guarantees, and that the resulting assumptions are maximal within ball-shaped sets. Additionally, we extend our approach to general networks of L subsystems using weighted combinations of interconnection effects. We instantiate the framework on linear systems by meeting finite-horizon safety, exact-time reachability, and finite-time reachability specifications, and on nonlinear systems by fulfilling general finite-horizon specifications. Our approach is demonstrated through numerical linear examples, and a nonlinear DC Microgrid case study, showcasing the impact of our framework in verifying temporal logic specifications with compositional reasoning.

Title: Safety-Critical Multi-Agent MCTS for Mixed Traffic Coordination at Unsignalized Roundabout
Authors: Zhihao Lin, Shuo Liu, Zhen Tian, Dezong Zhao, Jianglin Lan
Abstract: Decision-making at unsignalized roundabouts poses substantial challenges for autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in mixed traffic environments where AVs must coordinate safely with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). This paper presents a safety-critical multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework that integrates both deterministic and probabilistic prediction models to facilitate cooperative decision-making in complex roundabout scenarios. The proposed framework introduces three key innovations: (1) a hierarchical safety assessment module that systematically addresses AV-to-AV (A2A), AV-to-HDV (A2H), and AV-to-Road (A2R) interactions through dynamic safety thresholds and spatiotemporal risk evaluation; (2) an adaptive HDV behavior prediction scheme that combines the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) with probabilistic uncertainty modeling; and (3) a multi-objective reward optimization strategy that jointly considers safety, efficiency, and cooperative intent. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach under both fully autonomous (100% AVs) and mixed traffic (50% AVs + 50% HDVs) conditions. Compared to benchmark methods, our framework consistently reduces trajectory deviations across all AVs and significantly lowers the rate of Post-Encroachment Time (PET) violations, achieving only 1.0\% in the fully autonomous scenario and 3.2% in the mixed traffic setting.

Title: Optimizing Paths for Adaptive Fly-Scan Microscopy: An Extended Version
Authors: Yu Lu, Thomas F. Lynn, Ming Du, Zichao Di, Sven Leyffer
Abstract: In x-ray microscopy, traditional raster-scanning techniques are used to acquire a microscopic image in a series of step-scans. Alternatively, scanning the x-ray probe along a continuous path, called a fly-scan, reduces scan time and increases scan efficiency. However, not all regions of an image are equally important. Currently used fly-scan methods do not adapt to the characteristics of the sample during the scan, often wasting time in uniform, uninteresting regions. One approach to avoid unnecessary scanning in uniform regions for raster step-scans is to use deep learning techniques to select a shorter optimal scan path instead of a traditional raster scan path, followed by reconstructing the entire image from the partially scanned data. However, this approach heavily depends on the quality of the initial sampling, requires a large dataset for training, and incurs high computational costs. We propose leveraging the fly-scan method along an optimal scanning path, focusing on regions of interest (ROIs) and using image completion techniques to reconstruct details in non-scanned areas. This approach further shortens the scanning process and potentially decreases x-ray exposure dose while maintaining high-quality and detailed information in critical regions. To achieve this, we introduce a multi-iteration fly-scan framework that adapts to the scanned image. Specifically, in each iteration, we define two key functions: (1) a score function to generate initial anchor points and identify potential ROIs, and (2) an objective function to optimize the anchor points for convergence to an optimal set. Using these anchor points, we compute the shortest scanning path between optimized anchor points, perform the fly-scan, and subsequently apply image completion based on the acquired information in preparation for the next scan iteration.

Title: RadioDiff-Loc: Diffusion Model Enhanced Scattering Congnition for NLoS Localization with Sparse Radio Map Estimation
Authors: Xiucheng Wang, Qiming Zhang, Nan Cheng
Abstract: Accurate localization of non-cooperative signal sources in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environments remains a critical challenge with a wide range of applications, including autonomous navigation, industrial automation, and emergency response. In such settings, traditional positioning techniques relying on line-of-sight (LoS) or cooperative signaling fail due to severe multipath propagation and unknown transmit power. This paper proposes a novel generative inference framework for NLoS localization based on conditional diffusion models. By leveraging the physical insight that diffracted electromagnetic energy concentrates near building edges, we develop a sampling strategy that collects sparse received signal strength (RSS) measurements at the geometric vertices of obstacles--locations that maximize Fisher information and mutual information with respect to the unknown source. To overcome the lack of known transmission power, we normalize all sampled RSS values relative to the maximum observed intensity, enabling the construction of a power-invariant radio map (RM). A conditional diffusion model is trained to reconstruct the full RM based on environmental layout and sparse RSS observations. Localization is then achieved by identifying the brightest point on the generated RM. Moreover, the proposed framework is compatible with existing RSS-based localization algorithms, enabling a dual-driven paradigm that fuses physical knowledge and data-driven inference for improved accuracy. Extensive theoretical analysis and empirical validation demonstrate that our approach achieves high localization accuracy with significantly reduced sampling cost, offering a scalable and physically grounded solution for non-cooperative NLoS emitter localization.

Title: From Evaluation to Optimization: Neural Speech Assessment for Downstream Applications
Authors: Yu Tsao
Abstract: The evaluation of synthetic and processed speech has long been a cornerstone of audio engineering and speech science. Although subjective listening tests remain the gold standard for assessing perceptual quality and intelligibility, their high cost, time requirements, and limited scalability present significant challenges in the rapid development cycles of modern speech technologies. Traditional objective metrics, while computationally efficient, often exhibit weak correlation with human perception, creating a perceptual gap between system optimization and actual user experience. Bridging this gap requires speech assessment models that are more closely aligned with human perception. In recent years, numerous neural network-based speech assessment models have been developed to predict quality and intelligibility, achieving promising results. Beyond their role in evaluation, these models are increasingly integrated into downstream speech processing tasks. This review focuses on their role in two main areas: (1) serving as differentiable perceptual proxies that not only assess but also guide the optimization of speech enhancement and synthesis models; and (2) enabling the detection of salient speech characteristics to support more precise and efficient downstream processing. Finally, we discuss current limitations and outline future research directions to further advance the integration of speech assessment into speech processing pipelines.

Title: Multilingual Speech Recognition Using Discrete Tokens with a Two-step Training Strategy
Authors: Zehan Li, Yan Yang, Xueqing Li, Jian Kang, Xiao-Lei Zhang, Jie Li
Abstract: Pre-trained models, especially self-supervised learning (SSL) models, have demonstrated impressive results in automatic speech recognition (ASR) task. While most applications of SSL models focus on leveraging continuous representations as features for training downstream tasks, the utilization of discrete units has gained increasing attention in recent years owing to its lower storage requirements and broader range of applications. In multilingual ASR tasks, representations at different layers of the model contribute differently to various languages, complicating the unification of discrete unit modeling. In this paper, we propose a two-stage training strategy to improve the discrete token performance of pre-trained models and narrow the gap with continuous representation performance. We validate our method on the XLS-R model following the settings of Interspeech2024 Speech Processing Using Discrete Speech Unit Challenge. Our method demonstrates a significant improvement on the ML-SUPERB dataset, achieving a 44% relative reduction on CER for the XLS-R model. This surpasses the previous baseline set by the WavLM model, which achieves a 26% relative reduction on CER. Furthermore, our method achieves the first place among all the single-system results on the leaderboard.

Title: Efficient River Water Level Sensing Using Cellular CSI and Joint Space-Time Processing
Authors: Khawaja Fahad Masood, Kai Wu, Zhongqin Wang, J. Andrew Zhang, Shu-Lin Chen, Y. Jay Guo
Abstract: Accurate and timely water level monitoring is critical for flood prevention, environmental management, and emerging smart infrastructure systems. Traditional water sensing methods often rely on dedicated sensors, which can be costly to deploy and difficult to maintain and are vulnerable to damage during this http URL this work, we propose a novel cellular signalbased sensing scheme that passively estimates water level changes using downlink mobile signals from existing communication infrastructure. By capturing subtle variations in channel state information (CSI), the proposed method estimates the length changes of the water-reflected signal path, which correspond to water level variations. A space-time processing framework is developed to jointly estimate the angle of arrival and Doppler shift, enabling isolation and enhancement of the water-reflected path via beamforming, while effectively suppressing environmental noise. The phase evolution of the beamformed signal is then extracted to infer water level changes. To address clock asynchronism between the transmitter and receiver inherent in bistatic systems, we introduce a beamforming-based compensation technique for removing time-varying random phase offsets in CSI. Field experiments conducted across a river demonstrate that the proposed method enables accurate and reliable water level estimation, achieving a mean accuracy ranging from 1.5 cm to 3.05 cm across different receiver configurations and deployments.

Title: ECG-Based Stress Prediction with Power Spectral Density Features and Classification Models
Authors: Md. Mohibbul Haque Chowdhury, Nafisa Anjum, Md. Rokonuzzaman Mim
Abstract: Stress has emerged as a critical global health issue, contributing to cardiovascular disorders, depression, and several other long-term illnesses. Consequently, accurate and reliable stress monitoring systems are of growing importance. In this work, we propose a stress prediction framework based on electrocardiogram (ECG) signals recorded during multiple daily activities such as sitting, walking, and jogging. Frequency-domain indicators of autonomic nervous system activity were obtained through Power Spectral Density (PSD) analysis and utilized as input for machine learning models including Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. In addition, deep learning approaches, namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, were directly applied to the raw ECG signals. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of ensemble-based classifiers, with CatBoost achieving 90% accuracy. Moreover, the LSTM model provided superior results, attaining 94% accuracy with balanced precision, recall, and F1-score, reflecting its strength in modeling temporal dependencies in ECG data. Overall, the findings suggest that integrating frequency-domain feature extraction with advanced learning algorithms enhances stress prediction and paves the way for real-time healthcare monitoring solutions.

Title: Binaural Unmasking in Practical Use: Perceived Level of Phase-inverted Speech in Environmental Noise
Authors: Rina Kotani, Chiaki Miyazaki, Shiro Suzuki
Abstract: We aim to develop a technology that makes the sound from earphones and headphones easier to hear without increasing the sound pressure or eliminating ambient noise. To this end, we focus on harnessing the phenomenon of binaural unmasking through phase reversal in one ear. Specifically, we conduct experiments to evaluate the improvement of audibility caused by the phenomenon, using conditions that approximate practical scenarios. We use speech sounds by various speakers, including women, and noises that can be encountered in daily life (urban environmental sounds, cheers) to verify the effects of binaural unmasking under conditions close to practical situations. The results of experiments using the Japanese language showed that (i) speech in a noisy environment is perceived to be up to about 6 dB louder with phase reversal in one ear, and (ii) a certain effect (improvement of audibility by 5 dB or more) is obtained for all speakers and noises targeted in this study. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of binaural unmasking attributed to interaural phase differences in practical scenarios.

Title: On Performance of IoT Networks with Coordinated NOMA Transmission: Covert Monitoring and Information Decoding
Authors: Thai-Hoc Vu, Anh-Tu Le, Ngo Hoang Tu, Tan N. Nguyen, Miroslav Voznak
Abstract: This work investigates the covertness and security performance of Internet-of-Things (IoTs) networks under Rayleigh fading environments. Specifically, a cellular source transmits covert information to cell-edge users with the assistance of an IoT master node, employing a coordinated direct and relay transmission strategy combined with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). This approach not only enhances spectrum utilization but also generates friendly interference to complicate a warden's surveillance or an eavesdropper's decoding efforts. From a covertness perspective, we derive exact closed-form expressions for the detection error probability (DEP) under arbitrary judgment thresholds. We then identify the optimal judgment threshold for the worst-case scenario, at which the warden minimizes its DEP performance. Accordingly, we determine the effective region for user power allocation (PA) in NOMA transmission that satisfies the DEP constraint. From a security perspective, we derive analytical expressions for the secrecy outage probability under two eavesdropping strategies using selection combining and maximal ratio combining. Based on this analysis, we propose an adaptive PA scheme that maximizes covert rate while ensuring the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of legitimate users, the system's minimum covertness requirements, and supporting successive interference cancellation (SIC) procedures. Furthermore, we design an adaptive PA scheme that maximizes the secrecy rate while ensuring the QoS requirements of legitimate users and SIC conditions. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of the analytical framework, while the proposed optimization strategies effectively adjust PA coefficients to maximize either the covert rate or the secrecy rate.

Title: Group Relative Policy Optimization for Speech Recognition
Authors: Prashanth Gurunath Shivakumar, Yile Gu, Ankur Gandhe, Ivan Bulyko
Abstract: Speech Recognition has seen a dramatic shift towards adopting Large Language Models (LLMs). This shift is partly driven by good scalability properties demonstrated by LLMs, ability to leverage large amounts of labelled, unlabelled speech and text data, streaming capabilities with auto-regressive framework and multi-tasking with instruction following characteristics of LLMs. However, simple next-token prediction objective, typically employed with LLMs, have certain limitations in performance and challenges with hallucinations. In this paper, we propose application of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enable reinforcement learning from human feedback for automatic speech recognition (ASR). We design simple rule based reward functions to guide the policy updates. We demonstrate significant improvements in word error rate (upto 18.4% relative), reduction in hallucinations, increased robustness on out-of-domain datasets and effectiveness in domain adaptation.

Title: Online Identification using Adaptive Laws and Neural Networks for Multi-Quadrotor Centralized Transportation System
Authors: Tianhua Gao, Kohji Tomita, Akiya Kamimura
Abstract: This paper introduces an adaptive-neuro identification method that enhances the robustness of a centralized multi-quadrotor transportation system. This method leverages online tuning and learning on decomposed error subspaces, enabling efficient real-time compensation to time-varying disturbances and model uncertainties acting on the payload. The strategy is to decompose the high-dimensional error space into a set of low-dimensional subspaces. In this way, the identification problem for unseen features is naturally transformed into submappings (``slices'') addressed by multiple adaptive laws and shallow neural networks, which are updated online via Lyapunov-based adaptation without requiring persistent excitation (PE) and offline training. Due to the model-free nature of neural networks, this approach can be well adapted to highly coupled and nonlinear centralized transportation systems. It serves as a feedforward compensator for the payload controller without explicitly relying on the dynamics coupled with the payload, such as cables and quadrotors. The proposed control system has been proven to be stable in the sense of Lyapunov, and its enhanced robustness under time-varying disturbances and model uncertainties was demonstrated by numerical simulations.

Title: Robustness Enhancement for Multi-Quadrotor Centralized Transportation System via Online Tuning and Learning
Authors: Tianhua Gao, Kohji Tomita, Akiya Kamimura
Abstract: This paper introduces an adaptive-neuro geometric control for a centralized multi-quadrotor cooperative transportation system, which enhances both adaptivity and disturbance rejection. Our strategy is to coactively tune the model parameters and learn the external disturbances in real-time. To realize this, we augmented the existing geometric control with multiple neural networks and adaptive laws, where the estimated model parameters and the weights of the neural networks are simultaneously tuned and adjusted online. The Lyapunov-based adaptation guarantees bounded estimation errors without requiring either pre-training or the persistent excitation (PE) condition. The proposed control system has been proven to be stable in the sense of Lyapunov under certain preconditions, and its enhanced robustness under scenarios of disturbed environment and model-unmatched plant was demonstrated by numerical simulations.

Title: Correlation Analysis Between MF R-Mode Temporal ASF and Meteorological Factors
Authors: Jongmin Park, Junwoo Song, Taewon Kang, Jaewon Yu, Pyo-Woong Son
Abstract: As the vulnerabilities of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) have become more widely recognized, the need for complementary navigation systems has grown. Medium frequency ranging mode (MF R-Mode) has gained attention as an effective backup system during GNSS outages, owing to its strong signal strength and cost-effective scalability. However, to achieve accurate positioning, MF R-Mode requires correction for the additional secondary factor (ASF), a propagation delay affected by terrain. The temporal variation of ASF, known as temporal ASF, is typically corrected using reference stations; however, the effectiveness of this method decreases with distance from the reference station. In this study, we analyzed the correlation between temporal ASF and meteorological factors to evaluate the feasibility of predicting temporal ASF based on meteorological factors. Among these factors, temperature and humidity showed significant correlations with temporal ASF, suggesting their potential utility in ASF correction.

Title: Design of an Efficient Three-Level Buck-Boost Converter in PSIM
Authors: Justin London
Abstract: Compared to conventional converters, a three-level buck-boost (3L-BB) converter offers higher efficiency, reduced switching losses, and increased power density. We design a 3L-BB converter given certain voltage and current specifications in PSIM. We simulate the circuit in PSIM and analyze the power, voltage, and current waveforms by comparing the observed simulated values in PSIM with their mathematically driven theoretical values. We examine its power efficiencies and determine if the circuit meets given DC distribution specifications. We show that the proposed three-phase design, which uses two DC-DC single-ended primary-conductor converters (SEPICs), is power efficient and is a compelling solution for high-power and high-voltage applications.

Title: Dual Target-Mounted RISs-Assisted ISAC Against Eavesdropping and Malicious Interference
Authors: Zehra Yigit, Sefa Kayraklik, Ertugrul Basar, Ali Gorcin
Abstract: The synergy between integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) unlocks novel applications and advanced services for next-generation wireless networks, yet also introduces new security challenges. In this study, a novel dual target-mounted RISs-assisted ISAC scheme is proposed, where a base station with ISAC capability performs sensing of two unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) targets, one of which is legitimate and the other is eavesdropper, while communicating with the users through an RIS mounted on the legitimate UAV target. The proposed scheme addresses dual security threats posed by a hostile UAV target: eavesdropping on legitimate user communications and random interference attacks launched by a malicious RIS mounted on this eavesdropper UAV target, aiming to disrupt secure transmissions. A non-convex optimization problem maximizing the secrecy rate of the users is formulated, and a semi-definite relaxation (SDR)-based two-stage solution is developed to optimize the transmit beamforming matrix of the base station and the phase shift coefficients of the legitimate RIS. Extensive computer simulations are conducted to evaluate the robustness of the proposed solution under various system configurations. The proposed system's communication performance is assessed using the secrecy rate metric, while the sensing performance is evaluated through the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for angle-of-departure (AoD) estimation of the eavesdropper UAV target.

Title: Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-Based Task-Driven MIMO System for Image Transmission
Authors: Sijiang Li, Rongqing Zhang, Xiang Cheng, Jian Tang
Abstract: To support cooperative perception (CP) of networked mobile agents in dynamic scenarios, the efficient and robust transmission of sensory data is a critical challenge. Deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) has demonstrated promising results for image transmission under adverse channel conditions, outperforming traditional rule-based codecs. While recent works have explored to combine JSCC with the widely adopted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology, these approaches are still limited to the discrete-time analog transmission (DTAT) model and simple tasks. Given the limited performance of existing MIMO JSCC schemes in supporting complex CP tasks for networked mobile agents with digital MIMO communication systems, this paper presents a Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-based task-driven MIMO system for image transmission, referred to as SoM-MIMO. By leveraging the structural properties of the feature pyramid for perceptual tasks and the channel properties of the closed-loop MIMO communication system, SoM-MIMO enables efficient and robust digital MIMO transmission of images. Experimental results have shown that compared with two JSCC baseline schemes, our approach achieves average mAP improvements of 6.30 and 10.48 across all SNR levels, while maintaining identical communication overhead.

Title: Comprehensive Analysis and Exclusion Hypothesis of $α$-Approximation Method for Discretizing Analog Systems
Authors: Shen Chen, Jisong Wang, Dejun Liu, Jiaxi Ying, Shuai Wang
Abstract: A popular method for designing digital models is transforming the transfer function of the corresponding analog models from continuous domain (s-domain) into discrete domain (z-domain) using the s-to-z transformation. The alpha-approximation is a generalized form of these transformations. When alpha is set to 0.5, the result is the well-known Tustin transformation or bi-linear transformation. In this paper, we provided a comprehensive analysis of the alpha-approximation method, including mathematical interpretation, stability analysis and distortion analysis. Through mathematical interpretation, we revealed that it can be derived by numerically integrating the error function We defined this as the hexagonal approximation. We demonstrated that the stable range of alpha was [0.5, 1] by doing stability analysis. Through distortion analysis, we found that minimizing amplitude and phase distortion simultaneously seemed impossible by regulating alpha alone. Finally, We proposed an exclusion hypothesis hypothesizing that there is no single parameter alpha to minimize the amplitude distortion and phase distortion simultaneously across all frequency points within the Nyquist frequency range. This paper demonstrates that designing parameter alpha involves balancing amplitude and phase distortion.

Title: Environment-Aware Channel Measurement and Modeling for Terahertz Monostatic Sensing
Authors: Yejian Lyu, Zhiqiang Yuan, Henk Wymeersch, Chong Han
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) at terahertz (THz) frequencies holds significant promise for unifying ultra-high-speed wireless connectivity with fine-grained environmental awareness. Realistic and interpretable channel modeling is essential to fully realize the potential of such systems. This work presents a comprehensive investigation of monostatic sensing channels at 300~GHz, based on an extensive measurement campaign conducted at 57 co-located transceiver (TRx) positions across three representative indoor scenarios. Multipath component (MPC) parameters, including amplitude, delay, and angle, are extracted using a high-resolution space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm. To cluster the extracted MPCs, an image-processing-based clustering method, i.e., connected component labeling (CCL), is applied to group MPCs based on delay-angle consistency. Based on the measurement data, an environment-aware channel modeling framework is proposed to establish mappings between physical scenario attributes (e.g., reflector geometry, surface materials, and roughness) and their corresponding channel-domain manifestations. The framework incorporates both specular and diffuse reflections and leverages several channel parameters, e.g., reflection loss, Lambertian scattering, and intra-cluster dispersion models, to characterize reflection behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can reliably extract physical characteristics, e.g., structural and material information, from the observed channel characteristics, offering a promising foundation for advanced THz ISAC channel modeling.

Title: Robust Load Disturbance Rejection in PWM DC-DC Buck Converters
Authors: Simone Pirrera, Francesco Gabriele, Davide Lena, Fabio Pareschi, Diego Regruto, Gianluca Setti
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to robust load disturbance rejection in DC-DC Buck converters. We propose a novel control scheme based on the design of two nested feedback loops. First, we design the controller in the outer loop using H infinity optimal control theory, and we show, by means of mu-analysis, that such a controller provides robust stability in the presence of uncertainty affecting the physical parameters of the circuit. Then, we introduce an inner feedback loop to improve the system's response to output load disturbances. As far as the inner loop is considered, we propose a novel load estimation-compensation (LEC) scheme, and we discuss under what conditions the insertion of such an inner loop preserves the robust stability of the entire control system. The LEC scheme is compared with the other two linear structures based on well-established disturbance rejection methods. The advantages of LEC in terms of both complexity of implementation and obtained performances are discussed and demonstrated by means of numerical simulation. Finally, we present experimental results obtained through the implementation of the proposed control scheme on a prototype board to demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances disturbance rejection performances with respect to the approach commonly used in DC-DC buck converters.

Title: Affine-Doppler Division Multiplexing for High-Mobility Wireless Communications Systems
Authors: Yuanfang Ma, Zulin Wang, Peng Yuan, Qin Huang, Yuanhan Ni
Abstract: Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM) has been regarded as a candidate integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) waveform owing to its superior communication performance, outperforming the Orthogonal Time-Frequency Space (OTFS) that has been researched for a longer time. However, since the above two waveforms are incompatible with each other, the state-of-the-art methods well-designed for OTFS may not be directly applicable to AFDM. This paper introduces a new orthogonal multicarrier waveform, namely Affine-Doppler Division Multiplexing (ADDM), which can provide a generic framework and subsume the existing OTFS and AFDM as a particular case. ADDM modulating information symbols in the Affine-Doppler (A-D) domain based on a two-dimensional (2D) transform can enjoy both excellent unambiguous Doppler and Doppler resolution, which is the same as AFDM but outperforms OTFS. Moreover, benefiting from the 2D transform, the symbols block of ADDM in the A-D domain undergoes a 2D cyclic shift produced by the delay and the Doppler of the channel, similar to the 2D cyclic shift in the delay-Doppler domain of cyclic prefix (CP)-OTFS. This offers a potential to directly apply the state-of-the-art methods well-designed for OTFS and AFDM to ADDM. Numerical results show that ADDM achieves comparable BER performance with AFDM but outperforms OTFS in high-mobility scenarios.

Title: Implementing General-Order Frequency Dynamic Response Model and Frequency Excursion Duration Criterion in Unit Commitment Problem
Authors: Mohammad Rajabdorri, Bo Zhou, Lukas Sigrist, Enrique Lobato
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for incorporating frequency dynamics into the unit commitment (UC) problem through a general-order differential equation model, solved using Bernstein polynomial approximation. Traditional frequency-constrained UC (FCUC) models typically rely on simplified first-order assumptions or scalar frequency metrics, such as frequency nadir, to indirectly enforce dynamic behavior. In contrast, our formulation explicitly models time-domain frequency response using second-order dynamics, enabling a more accurate and flexible representation of generator behavior. The resulting differential equations are approximated with high fidelity using Bernstein polynomials, leading to a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation that remains computationally tractable for small-scale power systems. Additionally, we introduce a new constraint based on the duration of frequency excursions below a critical threshold, motivated by practical concerns such as relay operation and equipment protection. A data-driven method is employed to relate the area under this threshold-computed as the integral of the Bernstein approximation-to the duration of frequency deviation. The proposed framework is validated using real-world data from an island system in Spain, demonstrating enhanced frequency security with a moderate increase in operational cost. These results suggest the method's strong potential for application in low-inertia, small-scale power systems.

Title: High-Resolution Sensing in Communication-Centric ISAC: Deep Learning and Parametric Methods
Authors: Salmane Naoumi, Ahmad Bazzi, Roberto Bomfin, Marwa Chafii
Abstract: This paper introduces two novel algorithms designed to address the challenge of super-resolution sensing parameter estimation in bistatic configurations within communication-centric integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Our approach leverages the estimated channel state information derived from reference symbols originally intended for communication to achieve super-resolution sensing parameter estimation. The first algorithm, IFFT-C2VNN, employs complex-valued convolutional neural networks to estimate the parameters of different targets, achieving significant reductions in computational complexity compared to traditional methods. The second algorithm, PARAMING, utilizes a parametric method that capitalizes on the knowledge of the system model, including the transmit and receive array geometries, to extract the sensing parameters accurately. Through a comprehensive performance analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of both algorithms across a range of signal-to-noise ratios, underscoring their applicability in realistic ISAC scenarios.

Title: Robust Performance Analysis and Nonlinearity Shaping for Closed-loop Reset Control Systems
Authors: S. Ali Hosseini, Dragan Kostić, S. Hassan HosseinNia
Abstract: Reset elements are nonlinear filters that improve control performance beyond linear time-invariant (LTI) limits but introduce higher-order harmonics that complicate design. Although frequency-domain tools like describing functions (DFs) and higher-order sinusoidal-input describing functions (HOSIDFs) analyze reset control systems (RCS), no direct method yet quantifies the impact of higher-order harmonics on the error signal without time-domain simulations. This paper introduces a robustness factor, $\sigma_2(\omega)$, which quantifies the increase in the root-mean-square (RMS) value of the error signal due to HOSIDFs, enabling RCS to rely solely on first-order DF characteristics while accounting for nonlinear effects. By using this robustness factor, a systematic method for designing pre- and post-filters is developed to ensure a predefined bound on $\sigma_2(\omega)$, thereby limiting the influence of higher-order harmonics without altering first-order DF behavior. The proposed framework is validated through a case study on a planar precision positioning stage, demonstrating how the robustness factor guides the reduction of nonlinearities and improves performance predictability.

Title: Nuclear fusion plasma fuelling with ice pellets using a neuromorphic controller
Authors: L.L.T.C. Jansen, E. Petri, M. van Berkel, W.P.M.H. Heemels
Abstract: In reactor-grade tokamaks, pellet injection is the best candidate for core plasma fuelling. However, density control schemes that can handle the hybrid nature of this type of fuelling, i.e., the discrete impact of the pellets on the continuously evolving plasma density, are lacking. This paper proposes a neuromorphic controller, inspired by the integrate-and-fire neuronal model, to address this problem. The overall system is modelled as a hybrid system, and we analyse the proposed controller in closed loop with a single-input single-output linear time-invariant plasma model. The controller generates spikes, representing pellet launches, when the neuron variable reaches a certain threshold. Between the control actions, or spikes, the system evolves in open loop. We establish conditions on the controller variables and minimum actuator speed, depending on the reference value for the desired density, the pellet size and the time-constant of the plasma density, that guarantee a practical stability property for the closed-loop system. The results are illustrated in a numerical example.

Title: Beamforming Design for Pinching Antenna Systems with Multiple Receive Antennas
Authors: Enzhi Zhou, Yue Xiao, Ziyue Liu, Sotiris A. Tegos, Panagiotis D. Diamantoulakis, George K. Karagiannidis
Abstract: Next-generation networks require intelligent and robust channel conditions to support ultra-high data rates, seamless connectivity, and large-scale device deployments in dynamic environments. While flexible antenna technologies such as fluid and movable antennas offer some degree of adaptability, their limited reconfiguration range and structural rigidity reduce their effectiveness in restoring line-of-sight (LoS) links. As a complementary solution, pinching antenna systems (PASs) enable fine-grained, hardware-free control of radiation locations along a waveguide, offering enhanced flexibility in challenging propagation environments, especially under non-LoS (NLoS) conditions. This paper introduces a general and novel modeling framework for downlink PASs targeting users equipped with multiple receive antennas, addressing a practical yet underexplored scenario in the existing literature. Specifically, we first derive an analytical relationship between the received signal-to-noise ratio and the pinching antenna (PA) positions, and based on this, we propose a two-layer placement strategy. First, we optimize the central radiation point using large-scale channel characteristics, and then we use a heuristic compressed placement algorithm to approximate phase alignment across multiple receive antennas and select a spatially compact set of active elements. Simulation results demonstrate notable performance gains over conventional single-antenna schemes, particularly in short-range scenarios with dense PAs and widely spaced user antennas.

Title: Task and Motion Planning of Dynamic Systems using Hyperproperties for Signal Temporal Logics
Authors: Jianing Zhao, Bowen Ye, Xinyi Yu, Rupak Majumdar, Xiang Yin
Abstract: We investigate the task and motion planning problem for dynamical systems under signal temporal logic (STL) specifications. Existing works on STL control synthesis mainly focus on generating plans that satisfy properties over a single executed trajectory. In this work, we consider the planning problem for hyperproperties evaluated over a set of possible trajectories, which naturally arise in information-flow control problems. Specifically, we study discrete-time dynamical systems and employ the recently developed temporal logic HyperSTL as the new objective for planning. To solve this problem, we propose a novel recursive counterexample-guided synthesis approach capable of effectively handling HyperSTL specifications with multiple alternating quantifiers. The proposed method is not only applicable to planning but also extends to HyperSTL model checking for discrete-time dynamical systems. Finally, we present case studies on security-preserving planning and ambiguity-free planning to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HyperSTL planning framework.

Title: Selection of Optimal Number and Location of PMUs for CNN Based Fault Location and Identification
Authors: Khalid Daud Khattak, Muhammad A. Choudhry
Abstract: In this paper, we present a data-driven Forward Selection with Neighborhood Refinement (FSNR) algorithm to determine the number and placement of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) for maximizing deep-learning-based fault diagnosis performance. Candidate PMU locations are ranked via a cross-validated Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, and each selection is refined through local neighborhood exploration to produce a near-optimal sensor set. The resulting PMU subset is then supplied to a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for faulted-line localization and fault-type classification from time-series measurements. Evaluation on modified IEEE 34- and IEEE 123-bus systems demonstrates that the proposed FSNR-SVM method identifies a minimal PMU configuration that achieves the best overall CNN performance, attaining over 96 percent accuracy in fault location and over 99 percent accuracy in fault-type classification on the IEEE 34 system, and approximately 94 percent accuracy in fault location and around 99.8 percent accuracy in fault-type classification on the IEEE 123 system.

Title: Finite-Time Stabilization of a Class of Nonlinear Systems in Hilbert Space
Authors: Kamal Fenza, Moussa Labbadi, Mohamed Ouzahra
Abstract: This paper deals with the finite-time stabilization of a class of nonlinear infinite-dimensional systems. First, we consider a bounded matched perturbation in its linear form. It is shown that by using a set-valued function, both the convergence objective (finite-time) and the rejection of perturbations are achieved. Second, we consider a class of nonlinear systems and design a feedback control that ensures the closed-loop system is finite-time stable. All proofs presented in this paper regarding convergence are based on Lyapunov theory. The existence of solutions to the closed-loop system and its well-posedness are established using maximal monotone theory. To illustrate the applicability of the theoretical results, a heat equation is considered as an application of the main results.

Title: 2.4-GHz Integrated CMOS Low-Noise Amplifier (English Version)
Authors: Jorge L. González-Rios, Juan C. Cruz Hurtado, Robson L. Moreno, Diego Vázquez
Abstract: This paper presents the analysis, design, fabrication, and measurement of an integrated low-noise amplifier (LNA) implemented using a 130 nm CMOS technology, operating in the 2.4 GHz band. The LNA is a crucial component in the performance of receivers, particularly in integrated receivers. The proposed LNA was designed to meet the specifications of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Post-layout simulation results, including pads with electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection, are as follows: gain of 10.7 dB, noise figure of 2.7 dB, third-order input intercept point (IIP3) of 0.9 dBm, input and output impedance matching better than -20 dB with respect to 50~$\Omega$ terminations, with a power consumption of 505 $\mu$W powered from a 1.2 V supply. The obtained results fall within the range of those recently reported for the same topology and operating frequency. The measured scattering parameters (S-parameters) are consistent with the simulation results. This work contributes to the development of a new research line in Cuba on the design of radio-frequency (RF) integrated circuits.

Title: Nano Machine Intelligence: From a Communication Perspective
Authors: Sangjun Hwang, Bon-Hong Koo, Ho Joong Kim, Jang-Yeon Kwon, Chan-Byoung Chae
Abstract: We present an AI-integrated molecular communication link validated on a benchtop nanomachine testbed representative of subdermal implants. The system employs an indium-gallium-zinc-oxide electrolyte-gated FET (IGZO-EGFET) functionalized with glucose oxidase as a biocompatible receiver, a microfluidic channel with a syringe-pump transmitter using on-off keying (OOK), and a machine-intelligence pipeline that addresses model mismatch and hardware non-idealities. The pipeline integrates: (i) a modular universal decoder robust to vibration-induced noise, chemical delay, and single-tap intersymbol interference; (ii) a lightweight pilot-only synchronizer that estimates symbol intervals; and (iii) a virtual-response generator that augments data and scales symbol duration. Experiments across multiple chips and sessions demonstrate end-to-end chemical text transmission with consistent error-rate reductions compared to naive thresholding and standard neural baselines. By coupling biocompatible hardware with learning-based detection and generative augmentation, this work establishes a practical route toward AI-native nanomachine networks and higher rate molecular links, while providing a system blueprint adaptable to other biochemical modalities.

Title: On the Effect of Tap Changers and Nonlinear Loads on Voltage Stability
Authors: Andrea Zanelli, Dirk Schmidt, Matthias Resch, Marco Giovanelli, Martin Geidl, Walter Sattinger
Abstract: On 21 June 2024, a severe incident happened in the South-Eastern part of the Continental European power system. After a voltage collapse, large parts of Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as Croatia suffered from a blackout [1]. The initial tripping of two transmission lines resulted in a voltage collapse in these countries. Investigations have shown that a) transformers with on-load tap changers (OLTC) and b) nonlinear loads, in particular air conditioning systems, played a significant role in this event. Motivated by this, we carry out an assessment of the effect of OLTC on voltage stability in the presence of nonlinear loads. By doing this we hope to further shed some light on the potential instability mechanisms that can be triggered in scenarios like the above-mentioned blackout.

Title: Stability-Aware Joint Communication and Control for Nonlinear Control-Non-Affine Wireless Networked Control Systems
Authors: Rasika Vijithasena, Rafaela Scaciota, Mehdi Bennis, Sumudu Samarakoon
Abstract: Ensuring the stability of wireless networked control systems (WNCS) with nonlinear and control-non-affine dynamics, where system behavior is nonlinear with respect to both states and control decisions, poses a significant challenge, particularly under limited resources. However, it is essential in the context of 6G, which is expected to support reliable communication to enable real-time autonomous systems. This paper proposes a joint communication and control solution consisting of: i) a deep Koopman model capable of learning and mapping complex nonlinear dynamics into linear representations in an embedding space, predicting missing states, and planning control actions over a future time horizon; and ii) a scheduling algorithm that schedules sensor-controller communication based on Lyapunov optimization, which dynamically allocates communication resources based on system stability and available resources. Control actions are computed within this embedding space using a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) to ensure system stability. The proposed model is evaluated under varying conditions and its performance is compared against two baseline models; one that assumes systems are control-affine, and another that assumes identical control actions in the embedding and original spaces. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms both baselines, by achieving stability while requiring fewer transmissions.

Title: TREE:Token-Responsive Energy Efficiency Framework For Green AI-Integrated 6G Networks
Authors: Tao Yu, Kaixuan Huang, Tengsheng Wang, Jihong Li, Shunqing Zhang, Shuangfeng Han, Xiaoyun Wang, Qunsong Zeng, Kaibin Huang, Vincent K. N. Lau
Abstract: As wireless networks evolve toward AI-integrated intelligence, conventional energy-efficiency metrics fail to capture the value of AI tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel EE metric called Token-Responsive Energy Efficiency (TREE), which incorporates the token throughput of large models as network utility carriers into the system utility. Based on this metric, we analyze the design principles of AI-integrated 6G networks from the perspective of three critical AI elements, namely computing power, model and data. Case studies validate TREE's unique capability to expose energy-service asymmetries in hybrid traffic scenarios where conventional metrics prove inadequate. Although it is impossible to determine every design detail of AI-integrated 6G network at current time, we believe that the proposed TREE based framework will help the network operators to quantify the operating energy cost of AI services and continue to evolve towards sustainable 6G networks.

Title: Dual-end Fluid Antennas For Robust Anti-jamming in Low-altitude Air-ground Communications
Authors: Yifan Guo, Junshan Luo, Fanggang Wang, Haiyang Ding, Shilian Wang, Zhenhai Xu
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of co-channel interference and intentional jamming in low-altitude air-ground communications. Since conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems lack spatial adaptability to dynamically balance signal enhancement against interference suppression, we propose a transformative fluid antenna system (FAS)-assisted heterogeneous dual-layer transmission architecture. Specifically, a terrestrial base station with FPA serves ground users, while a low altitude-serving base station equipped with FAS communicates with the aerial user, also equipped with FAS, under the attack of a malicious jammer. We formulate a worst-case achievable rate maximization problem for aerial user subject to constraints including quality-of-service for terrestrial users, imperfect jamming directions, minimum antenna separation, etc. To address the non-convex problem, we propose a fractional programming-block coordinate descent algorithm that alternately optimizes the transmit precoders, receive combiner, and antenna positions at both transceiver sides. Convex hull-based approach and geometric boundary method are used to handle the jamming uncertainty and antenna placement constraints in confined spatial regions, respectively. Extensive simulations validate significant performance gains. The FAS achieves up to 56\% higher data rates than FPA under equivalent power constraints. Strategic antenna repositioning demonstrably enhances signal quality while suppressing interference, maintaining robustness across diverse jammer channel uncertainties.

Title: Interference Management for Integrated Sensing and Communications: A Multiple Access Perspective
Authors: Kexin Chen, Yijie Mao, Wonjae Shin, Bruno Clerckx, Christos Masouros
Abstract: The integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technique has been considered a key enabler for 6G radio access networks. ISAC fulfills a brand new paradigm shift in wireless networks via the seamless interplay between communication and sensing within a unified network. However, the tight integration of these functionalities inevitably gives rise to various types of interference, posing significant challenges to existing ISAC waveform designs and rendering interference management a critical concern. Inspired by the development trajectory of wireless communications, different multiple access (MA) techniques, such as orthogonal multiple access (OMA), space-division multiple access (SDMA), and more recently, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), have been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in efficiently utilizing limited spectrum resources, designing ISAC waveforms, as well as managing inter-user interference and inter-functionality interference in ISAC. Notably, the interplay between MA and ISAC presents mutually beneficial integration. On the one hand, ISAC helps MA techniques better exploit their interference management capability beyond the communication-only networks. On the other hand, different MA techniques serve as promising solutions for inter-functionality and inter-user interference management in ISAC. In this paper, we deliver the first comprehensive tutorial of MA techniques in ISAC networks. Specifically, we illustrate the fundamental principles of ISAC, classify the diverse types of interference in different ISAC systems, and compare MA-assisted ISAC designs, highlighting their respective advantages and limitations. Moreover, we provide an outlook on the emerging applications and future research directions of different MA-assisted ISAC.

Title: autoPET IV challenge: Incorporating organ supervision and human guidance for lesion segmentation in PET/CT
Authors: Junwei Huang, Yingqi Hao, Yitong Luo, Ziyu Wang, Mingxuan Liu, Yifei Chen, Yuanhan Wang, Lei Xiang, Qiyuan Tian
Abstract: Lesion Segmentation in PET/CT scans is an essential part of modern oncological workflows. To address the challenges of time-intensive manual annotation and high inter-observer variability, the autoPET challenge series seeks to advance automated segmentation methods in complex multi-tracer and multi-center settings. Building on this foundation, autoPET IV introduces a human-in-the-loop scenario to efficiently utilize interactive human guidance in segmentation tasks. In this work, we incorporated tracer classification, organ supervision and simulated clicks guidance into the nnUNet Residual Encoder framework, forming an integrated pipeline that demonstrates robust performance in a fully automated (zero-guidance) context and efficiently leverages iterative interactions to progressively enhance segmentation accuracy.

Title: Frequency-Domain Characterization of Load Demand from Electrified Highways
Authors: Ashutossh Gupta, Vassilis Kekatos, Ruoyu Yang, Dionysios Aliprantis, Steve Pekarek
Abstract: Electrified roadways (ER) equipped with dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) capabilities can patently extend the driving range and reduce the battery size of electric vehicles (EVs). However, due to the spatial arrangement of the transmitter coils in the ER, the DWPT load exhibits frequency content that could excite power system frequency dynamics. In this context, this work aims to study the spectrum of DWPT loads under different traffic conditions. We develop statistical models for EVs moving at constant speeds to identify the location and magnitude of DWPT load harmonics. Our analysis reveals that the fundamental frequency is dependent on the ER coil spacing and the average EV speed. In the worst-case yet unlikely scenario that EVs move in a synchronized fashion, the amplitude of harmonics scales with the number of EVs. On the contrary, when EVs move freely, harmonics scale with the square root of the number of EVs. Platoon formations can accentuate harmonics. We also show that for higher-order harmonics, the spectral content around harmonics decreases in magnitude and increases in bandwidth. Despite the simplified models, our analysis offers valuable insights for ER planners and grid operators. Numerical tests using a traffic simulator corroborate some of these insights.

Title: Know What, Know Why: Semantic Hazard Communication for Intelligent V2X Systems
Authors: Chen Sun, Wenqi Zhang, Bizhu Wang, Xiaodong Xu, Chau Yuen, Yan Zhang, Ping Zhang
Abstract: In current vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication systems, roadside units (RSUs) broadcast brief warning messages that alert nearby vehicles to avoid potential hazards. However, these messages lack contextual information on why a warning is issued, leading to excessive caution or inefficient driving behaviors. To avoid such a situation, we propose a semantic-enhanced and explainable V2X (SEE-V2X) system. In the proposed system, RSUs equipped with smart cameras detect obstructions and transmit context-aware messages to vehicles. By understanding both what the hazard is and why it occurs, drivers can make more intelligent decisions based on their specific driving situation. Furthermore, through a real-field demonstration, we show the new "see-through" feature in the proposed system, which enables drivers to visualize hidden pedestrians behind obstacles. We also perform simulations to compare traditional V2X with SEE-V2X under different traffic conditions. The results show that SEE-V2X significantly improves traffic efficiency and reduces unnecessary deceleration.

Title: HyDeFuse: Provably Convergent Denoiser-Driven Hyperspectral Fusion
Authors: Sagar Kumar, Unni V S, Kunal Narayan Chaudhury
Abstract: Hyperspectral (HS) images provide fine spectral resolution but have limited spatial resolution, whereas multispectral (MS) images capture finer spatial details but have fewer bands. HS-MS fusion aims to integrate HS and MS images to generate a single image with improved spatial and spectral resolution. This is commonly formulated as an inverse problem with a linear forward model. However, reconstructing high-quality images using the forward model alone is challenging, necessitating the use of regularization techniques. Over the years, numerous methods have been developed, including wavelets, total variation, low-rank models, and deep neural networks. In this work, we investigate the paradigm of denoiser-driven regularization, where a powerful off-the-shelf denoiser is used for implicit regularization within an iterative algorithm. This approach has shown promise but remains relatively underexplored in hyperspectral imaging. Our focus is on a crucial aspect of denoiser-driven algorithms: ensuring convergence of the iterations. It is known that powerful denoisers can produce high-quality reconstructions, but they are also prone to instability and can cause the iterations to diverge. The challenge is to design denoisers that come with a convergence guarantee. In this work, we propose a denoiser-driven fusion algorithm, HyDeFuse, which leverages a class of pseudo-linear denoisers for implicit regularization. We demonstrate how the contraction mapping theorem can be applied to establish global linear convergence of HyDeFuse. Additionally, we introduce enhancements to the denoiser that significantly improve the performance of HyDeFuse, making it competitive with state-of-the-art techniques. We validate our theoretical results and present fusion results on publicly available datasets to demonstrate the performance of HyDeFuse.

Title: LLM-Enhanced Space-Air-Ground-Sea Integrated Networks
Authors: Halvin Yang, Sangarapillai Lambotharan, Mahsa Derakhshani, Lajos Hanzo
Abstract: The space-air-ground-sea integrated networking (SAGSIN) concept promises seamless global multimedia connectivity, yet two obstacles still limit its practical deployment. Firstly, high-velocity satellites, aerial relays and sea-surface platforms suffer from obsolete channel state information (CSI), undermining feedback-based adaptation. Secondly, data-rate disparity across the protocol stack is extreme: terabit optical links in space coexist with kilobit acoustic under-water links. This article shows that a single large language model (LLM) backbone, trained jointly on radio, optical and acoustic traces, can provide a unified, data-driven adaptation layer that addresses both rapid CSI ageing and severe bandwidth disparity across the SAGSIN protocol stack. Explicitly, an LLM-based long-range channel predictor forecasts the strongest delay-Doppler components several coherence intervals ahead, facilitating near-capacity reception despite violent channel fluctuations. Furthermore, our LLM-based semantic encoder turns raw sensor payloads into task-oriented tokens. This substantially reduces the SNR required for high-fidelity image delivery in a coastal underwater link, circumventing the data rate limitation by semantic communications. Inclusion of these tools creates a medium-agnostic adaptation layer that spans radio, optical and acoustic channels. We conclude with promising open research directions in on-device model compression, multimodal fidelity control, cross-layer resource orchestration and trustworthy operation, charting a path from laboratory prototypes to field deployment.

Title: From Sound to Sight: Towards AI-authored Music Videos
Authors: Leo Vitasovic, Stella Graßhof, Agnes Mercedes Kloft, Ville V. Lehtola, Martin Cunneen, Justyna Starostka, Glenn McGarry, Kun Li, Sami S. Brandt
Abstract: Conventional music visualisation systems rely on handcrafted ad hoc transformations of shapes and colours that offer only limited expressiveness. We propose two novel pipelines for automatically generating music videos from any user-specified, vocal or instrumental song using off-the-shelf deep learning models. Inspired by the manual workflows of music video producers, we experiment on how well latent feature-based techniques can analyse audio to detect musical qualities, such as emotional cues and instrumental patterns, and distil them into textual scene descriptions using a language model. Next, we employ a generative model to produce the corresponding video clips. To assess the generated videos, we identify several critical aspects and design and conduct a preliminary user evaluation that demonstrates storytelling potential, visual coherency and emotional alignment with the music. Our findings underscore the potential of latent feature techniques and deep generative models to expand music visualisation beyond traditional approaches.

Title: A Survey on Evaluation Metrics for Music Generation
Authors: Faria Binte Kader, Santu Karmaker
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in music generation systems, the methodologies for evaluating generated music have not progressed as expected due to the complex nature of music, with aspects such as structure, coherence, creativity, and emotional expressiveness. In this paper, we shed light on this research gap, introducing a detailed taxonomy for evaluation metrics for both audio and symbolic music representations. We include a critical review identifying major limitations in current evaluation methodologies which includes poor correlation between objective metrics and human perception, cross-cultural bias, and lack of standardization that hinders cross-model comparisons. Addressing these gaps, we further propose future research directions towards building a comprehensive evaluation framework for music generation evaluation.

Title: T-MLP: Tailed Multi-Layer Perceptron for Level-of-Detail Signal Representation
Authors: Chuanxiang Yang, Yuanfeng Zhou, Guangshun Wei, Siyu Ren, Yuan Liu, Junhui Hou, Wenping Wang
Abstract: Level-of-detail (LoD) representation is critical for efficiently modeling and transmitting various types of signals, such as images and 3D shapes. In this work, we present a novel neural architecture that supports LoD signal representation. Our architecture is based on an elaborate modification of the widely used Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which inherently operates at a single scale and therefore lacks native support for LoD. Specifically, we introduce the Tailed Multi-Layer Perceptron (T-MLP) that extends the MLP by attaching multiple output branches, also called tails, to its hidden layers, enabling direct supervision at multiple depths. Our loss formulation and training strategy allow each hidden layer to effectively learn a target signal at a specific LoD, thus enabling multi-scale modeling. Extensive experimental results show that our T-MLP outperforms other neural LoD baselines across a variety of signal representation tasks.

Abstract: Access to smart meter data offers system-wide benefits but raises significant privacy concerns due to the personal information it contains. Privacy-preserving techniques could facilitate wider access, though they introduce privacy-utility trade-offs. Understanding consumer valuations for anonymisation can help identify appropriate trade-offs. However, existing studies do not focus on anonymisation specifically or account for information asymmetries regarding privacy risks, raising questions about the validity of informed consent under current regulations. We use a mixed-methods approach to estimate non-monetary (willingness-to-share and smart metering demand) and monetary (willingness-to-pay/accept) preferences for anonymisation, based on a representative sample of 965 GB bill payers. An embedded randomised control trial examines the effect of providing information about privacy implications. On average, consumers are willing to pay for anonymisation, are more willing to share data when anonymised and less willing to share non-anonymised data once anonymisation is presented as an option. However, a significant minority remains unwilling to adopt smart meters, despite anonymisation. We find strong evidence of information asymmetries that suppress demand for anonymisation and identify substantial variation across demographic and electricity supply characteristics. Qualitative responses corroborate the quantitative findings, underscoring the need for stronger privacy defaults, user-centric design, and consent mechanisms that enable truly informed decisions.

Title: Algorithms for Collaborative Harmonization
Authors: Eyal Briman, Eyal Leizerovich, Nimrod Talmon
Abstract: We consider a specific scenario of text aggregation, in the realm of musical harmonization. Musical harmonization shares similarities with text aggregation, however the language of harmony is more structured than general text. Concretely, given a set of harmonization suggestions for a given musical melody, our interest lies in devising aggregation algorithms that yield an harmonization sequence that satisfies the following two key criteria: (1) an effective representation of the collective suggestions; and (2) an harmonization that is musically coherent. We present different algorithms for the aggregation of harmonies given by a group of agents and analyze their complexities. The results indicate that the Kemeny and plurality-based algorithms are most effective in assessing representation and maintaining musical coherence.

Title: Self-supervised large-scale kidney abnormality detection in drug safety assessment studies
Authors: Ivan Slootweg, Natalia P. García-De-La-Puente, Geert Litjens, Salma Dammak
Abstract: Kidney abnormality detection is required for all preclinical drug development. It involves a time-consuming and costly examination of hundreds to thousands of whole-slide images per drug safety study, most of which are normal, to detect any subtle changes indicating toxic effects. In this study, we present the first large-scale self-supervised abnormality detection model for kidney toxicologic pathology, spanning drug safety assessment studies from 158 compounds. We explore the complexity of kidney abnormality detection on this scale using features extracted from the UNI foundation model (FM) and show that a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at chance, demonstrating that the FM-generated features alone are insufficient for detecting abnormalities. We then demonstrate that a self-supervised method applied to the same features can achieve better-than-chance performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a negative predictive value of 89%. With further development, such a model can be used to rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment studies, reducing the costs and time associated with drug development.

Title: CoComposer: LLM Multi-agent Collaborative Music Composition
Authors: Peiwen Xing, Aske Plaat, Niki van Stein
Abstract: Existing AI Music composition tools are limited in generation duration, musical quality, and controllability. We introduce CoComposer, a multi-agent system that consists of five collaborating agents, each with a task based on the traditional music composition workflow. Using the AudioBox-Aesthetics system, we experimentally evaluate CoComposer on four compositional criteria. We test with three LLMs (GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3-0324, Gemini-2.5-Flash), and find (1) that CoComposer outperforms existing multi-agent LLM-based systems in music quality, and (2) compared to a single-agent system, in production complexity. Compared to non- LLM MusicLM, CoComposer has better interpretability and editability, although MusicLM still produces better music.

Title: Newton-Flow Particle Filters based on Generalized Cramér Distance
Authors: Uwe D. Hanebeck
Abstract: We propose a recursive particle filter for high-dimensional problems that inherently never degenerates. The state estimate is represented by deterministic low-discrepancy particle sets. We focus on the measurement update step, where a likelihood function is used for representing the measurement and its uncertainty. This likelihood is progressively introduced into the filtering procedure by homotopy continuation over an artificial time. A generalized Cramér distance between particle sets is derived in closed form that is differentiable and invariant to particle order. A Newton flow then continually minimizes this distance over artificial time and thus smoothly moves particles from prior to posterior density. The new filter is surprisingly simple to implement and very efficient. It just requires a prior particle set and a likelihood function, never estimates densities from samples, and can be used as a plugin replacement for classic approaches.

Title: Generalizable Audio Spoofing Detection using Non-Semantic Representations
Authors: Arnab Das, Yassine El Kheir, Carlos Franzreb, Tim Herzig, Tim Polzehl, Sebastian Möller
Abstract: Rapid advancements in generative modeling have made synthetic audio generation easy, making speech-based services vulnerable to spoofing attacks. Consequently, there is a dire need for robust countermeasures more than ever. Existing solutions for deepfake detection are often criticized for lacking generalizability and fail drastically when applied to real-world data. This study proposes a novel method for generalizable spoofing detection leveraging non-semantic universal audio representations. Extensive experiments have been performed to find suitable non-semantic features using TRILL and TRILLsson models. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves comparable performance on the in-domain test set while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches on out-of-domain test sets. Notably, it demonstrates superior generalization on public-domain data, surpassing methods based on hand-crafted features, semantic embeddings, and end-to-end architectures.

Title: Speech Foundation Models Generalize to Time Series Tasks from Wearable Sensor Data
Authors: Jaya Narain, Zakaria Aldeneh, Shirley Ren
Abstract: Both speech and sensor time series data encode information in both the time- and frequency- domains, like spectral powers and waveform shapelets. We show that speech foundation models learn representations that are domain-independent and achieve state-of-the-art performance on time series tasks from wearable sensors. Probes trained on features extracted from HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0 outperform those extracted from self-supervised models trained directly on modality specific datasets for mood classification, arrhythmia detection, and activity classification tasks. We find a particularly strong relevance of the convolutional feature encoders from speech models for wearable sensor tasks. The methods proposed here improve performance and robustness for data-scarce time series tasks, using simple probing methods. This work is a step towards generalized time series models for speech and sensor data, a topic for further exploration.

Title: Evaluating the Effectiveness of Transformer Layers in Wav2Vec 2.0, XLS-R, and Whisper for Speaker Identification Tasks
Authors: Linus Stuhlmann, Michael Alexander Saxer
Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of three advanced speech encoder models, Wav2Vec 2.0, XLS-R, and Whisper, in speaker identification tasks. By fine-tuning these models and analyzing their layer-wise representations using SVCCA, k-means clustering, and t-SNE visualizations, we found that Wav2Vec 2.0 and XLS-R capture speaker-specific features effectively in their early layers, with fine-tuning improving stability and performance. Whisper showed better performance in deeper layers. Additionally, we determined the optimal number of transformer layers for each model when fine-tuned for speaker identification tasks.

Title: Revealing Hidden Precursors to Earthquakes via a Stress-Sensitive Transformation of Seismic Noise
Authors: Nader Shakibay Senobari
Abstract: Earthquake prediction has long been one of the most elusive challenges in science. Laboratory experiments and simulations suggest that failure precursors should exist, yet reliable signals have remained unobserved in real-world seismic records, leaving open the question of whether they are absent in nature or simply hidden within noise. Here we introduce a stress-sensitive frequency-domain transformation that tracks energy differences between adjacent frequency bands, isolating subtle spectral changes linked to evolving shear and normal stress. Applied to both laboratory acoustic emission data and seismic records from seven major earthquakes (Mw 5.9-9.0), including the 2011 Tohoku and 2023 Turkey-Syria events, the transform consistently reveals precursory signatures, arc-like trajectories and accelerations toward extrema, emerging hours to days before rupture. These features are robust across diverse tectonic settings, from induced seismicity and volcanic collapse to continental strike-slip and subduction megathrust earthquakes. Our findings demonstrate that hidden precursors are indeed encoded in ambient seismic noise, offering a pathway toward real-time fault monitoring and actionable short-term earthquake forecasting.

Title: Towards High-Fidelity and Controllable Bioacoustic Generation via Enhanced Diffusion Learning
Authors: Tianyu Song, Ton Viet Ta
Abstract: Generative modeling offers new opportunities for bioacoustics, enabling the synthesis of realistic animal vocalizations that could support biomonitoring efforts and supplement scarce data for endangered species. However, directly generating bird call waveforms from noisy field recordings remains a major challenge. We propose BirdDiff, a generative framework designed to synthesize bird calls from a noisy dataset of 12 wild bird species. The model incorporates a "zeroth layer" stage for multi-scale adaptive bird-call enhancement, followed by a diffusion-based generator conditioned on three modalities: Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, species labels, and textual descriptions. The enhancement stage improves signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while minimizing spectral distortion, achieving the highest SNR gain (+10.45 dB) and lowest Itakura-Saito Distance (0.54) compared to three widely used non-training enhancement methods. We evaluate BirdDiff against a baseline generative model, DiffWave. Our method yields substantial improvements in generative quality metrics: Fréchet Audio Distance (0.590 to 0.213), Jensen-Shannon Divergence (0.259 to 0.226), and Number of Statistically-Different Bins (7.33 to 5.58). To assess species-specific detail preservation, we use a ResNet50 classifier trained on the original dataset to identify generated samples. Classification accuracy improves from 35.9% (DiffWave) to 70.1% (BirdDiff), with 8 of 12 species exceeding 70% accuracy. These results demonstrate that BirdDiff enables high-fidelity, controllable bird call generation directly from noisy field recordings.

Title: Contact-Aided Navigation of Flexible Robotic Endoscope Using Deep Reinforcement Learning in Dynamic Stomach
Authors: Chi Kit Ng, Huxin Gao, Tian-Ao Ren, Jiewen Lai, Hongliang Ren
Abstract: Navigating a flexible robotic endoscope (FRE) through the gastrointestinal tract is critical for surgical diagnosis and treatment. However, navigation in the dynamic stomach is particularly challenging because the FRE must learn to effectively use contact with the deformable stomach walls to reach target locations. To address this, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based Contact-Aided Navigation (CAN) strategy for FREs, leveraging contact force feedback to enhance motion stability and navigation precision. The training environment is established using a physics-based finite element method (FEM) simulation of a deformable stomach. Trained with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, our approach achieves high navigation success rates (within 3 mm error between the FRE's end-effector and target) and significantly outperforms baseline policies. In both static and dynamic stomach environments, the CAN agent achieved a 100% success rate with 1.6 mm average error, and it maintained an 85% success rate in challenging unseen scenarios with stronger external disturbances. These results validate that the DRL-based CAN strategy substantially enhances FRE navigation performance over prior methods.

Title: Jacobian Exploratory Dual-Phase Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Endoluminal Navigation of Deformable Continuum Robots
Authors: Yu Tian, Chi Kit Ng, Hongliang Ren
Abstract: Deformable continuum robots (DCRs) present unique planning challenges due to nonlinear deformation mechanics and partial state observability, violating the Markov assumptions of conventional reinforcement learning (RL) methods. While Jacobian-based approaches offer theoretical foundations for rigid manipulators, their direct application to DCRs remains limited by time-varying kinematics and underactuated deformation dynamics. This paper proposes Jacobian Exploratory Dual-Phase RL (JEDP-RL), a framework that decomposes planning into phased Jacobian estimation and policy execution. During each training step, we first perform small-scale local exploratory actions to estimate the deformation Jacobian matrix, then augment the state representation with Jacobian features to restore approximate Markovianity. Extensive SOFA surgical dynamic simulations demonstrate JEDP-RL's three key advantages over proximal policy optimization (PPO) baselines: 1) Convergence speed: 3.2x faster policy convergence, 2) Navigation efficiency: requires 25% fewer steps to reach the target, and 3) Generalization ability: achieve 92% success rate under material property variations and achieve 83% (33% higher than PPO) success rate in the unseen tissue environment.

Title: SaD: A Scenario-Aware Discriminator for Speech Enhancement
Authors: Xihao Yuan, Siqi Liu, Yan Chen, Hang Zhou, Chang Liu, Hanting Chen, Jie Hu
Abstract: Generative adversarial network-based models have shown remarkable performance in the field of speech enhancement. However, the current optimization strategies for these models predominantly focus on refining the architecture of the generator or enhancing the quality evaluation metrics of the discriminator. This approach often overlooks the rich contextual information inherent in diverse scenarios. In this paper, we propose a scenario-aware discriminator that captures scene-specific features and performs frequency-domain division, thereby enabling a more accurate quality assessment of the enhanced speech generated by the generator. We conducted comprehensive experiments on three representative models using two publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that our method can effectively adapt to various generator architectures without altering their structure, thereby unlocking further performance gains in speech enhancement across different scenarios.

Title: Lagrangian Relaxation for Multi-Action Partially Observable Restless Bandits: Heuristic Policies and Indexability
Authors: Rahul Meshram, Kesav Kaza
Abstract: Partially observable restless multi-armed bandits have found numerous applications including in recommendation systems, communication systems, public healthcare outreach systems, and in operations research. We study multi-action partially observable restless multi-armed bandits, it is a generalization of the classical restless multi-armed bandit problem -- 1) each bandit has finite states, and the current state is not observable, 2) each bandit has finite actions. In particular, we assume that more than two actions are available for each bandit. We motivate our problem with the application of public-health intervention planning. We describe the model and formulate a long term discounted optimization problem, where the state of each bandit evolves according to a Markov process, and this evolution is action dependent. The state of a bandit is not observable but one of finitely many feedback signals are observable. Each bandit yields a reward, based on the action taken on that bandit. The agent is assumed to have a budget constraint. The bandits are assumed to be independent. However, they are weakly coupled at the agent through the budget constraint. We first analyze the Lagrangian bound method for our partially observable restless bandits. The computation of optimal value functions for finite-state, finite-action POMDPs is non-trivial. Hence, the computation of Lagrangian bounds is also challenging. We describe approximations for the computation of Lagrangian bounds using point based value iteration (PBVI) and online rollout policy. We further present various properties of the value functions and provide theoretical insights on PBVI and online rollout policy. We study heuristic policies for multi-actions PORMAB. Finally, we discuss present Whittle index policies and their limitations in our model.

Title: Entropy-based Coarse and Compressed Semantic Speech Representation Learning
Authors: Jialong Zuo, Guangyan Zhang, Minghui Fang, Shengpeng Ji, Xiaoqi Jiao, Jingyu Li, Yiwen Guo, Zhou Zhao
Abstract: Discrete speech representation learning has recently attracted increasing interest in both acoustic and semantic modeling. Existing approaches typically encode 16 kHz waveforms into discrete tokens at a rate of 25 or 50 tokens per second. However, given that speech generally conveys only 2 to 5 words per second, such fine-grained tokenization introduces redundancy and hinders efficiency in downstream training and inference. Moreover, semantic speech representations at this frequency primarily capture phonetic-level information, while semantic understanding may not require such detailed token-level resolution. To address these limitations, we propose an entropy-based dynamic aggregation framework for learning compressed semantic speech representations. A speech language model is first pre-trained via next-token prediction on large-scale unlabeled data to capture frequent token patterns. Predictive entropy is then used to adaptively determine aggregation boundaries, followed by a cross-attention module that fuses information within each segment. By adjusting the entropy threshold, the granularity and compression ratio of the representations can be flexibly controlled. Experiments on ASR, speech-to-text translation, and voice conversion tasks demonstrate that the compressed representations perform on par with or better than dense token sequences, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Title: Needle Biopsy And Fiber-Optic Compatible Robotic Insertion Platform
Authors: Fanxin Wang, Yikun Cheng, Chuyuan Tao, Rohit Bhargava, Thenkurussi Kesavadas
Abstract: Tissue biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing many diseases, involving the extraction of diseased tissue for histopathology analysis by expert pathologists. However, this procedure has two main limitations: 1) Manual sampling through tissue biopsy is prone to inaccuracies; 2) The extraction process is followed by a time-consuming pathology test. To address these limitations, we present a compact, accurate, and maneuverable robotic insertion platform to overcome the limitations in traditional histopathology. Our platform is capable of steering a variety of tools with different sizes, including needle for tissue extraction and optical fibers for vibrational spectroscopy applications. This system facilitates the guidance of end-effector to the tissue and assists surgeons in navigating to the biopsy target area for multi-modal diagnosis. In this paper, we outline the general concept of our device, followed by a detailed description of its mechanical design and control scheme. We conclude with the validation of the system through a series of tests, including positioning accuracy, admittance performance, and tool insertion efficacy.

Title: Gray-Box Computed Torque Control for Differential-Drive Mobile Robot Tracking
Authors: Arman Javan Sekhavat Pishkhani (University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran)
Abstract: This study presents a learning-based nonlinear algorithm for tracking control of differential-drive mobile robots. The Computed Torque Method (CTM) suffers from inaccurate knowledge of system parameters, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms are known for sample inefficiency and weak stability guarantees. The proposed method replaces the black-box policy network of a DRL agent with a gray-box Computed Torque Controller (CTC) to improve sample efficiency and ensure closed-loop stability. This approach enables finding an optimal set of controller parameters for an arbitrary reward function using only a few short learning episodes. The Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm is used for this purpose. Additionally, some controller parameters are constrained to lie within known value ranges, ensuring the RL agent learns physically plausible values. A technique is also applied to enforce a critically damped closed-loop time response. The controller's performance is evaluated on a differential-drive mobile robot simulated in the MuJoCo physics engine and compared against the raw CTC and a conventional kinematic controller.

Title: Safe and Efficient Lane-Changing for Autonomous Vehicles: An Improved Double Quintic Polynomial Approach with Time-to-Collision Evaluation
Authors: Rui Bai, Rui Xu, Teng Rui, Jiale Liu, Qi Wei Oung, Hoi Leong Lee, Zhen Tian, Fujiang Yuan
Abstract: Autonomous driving technology has made significant advancements in recent years, yet challenges remain in ensuring safe and comfortable interactions with human-driven vehicles (HDVs), particularly during lane-changing maneuvers. This paper proposes an improved double quintic polynomial approach for safe and efficient lane-changing in mixed traffic environments. The proposed method integrates a time-to-collision (TTC) based evaluation mechanism directly into the trajectory optimization process, ensuring that the ego vehicle proactively maintains a safe gap from surrounding HDVs throughout the maneuver. The framework comprises state estimation for both the autonomous vehicle (AV) and HDVs, trajectory generation using double quintic polynomials, real-time TTC computation, and adaptive trajectory evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to embed an analytic TTC penalty directly into the closed-form double-quintic polynomial solver, enabling real-time safety-aware trajectory generation without post-hoc validation. Extensive simulations conducted under diverse traffic scenarios demonstrate the safety, efficiency, and comfort of the proposed approach compared to conventional methods such as quintic polynomials, Bezier curves, and B-splines. The results highlight that the improved method not only avoids collisions but also ensures smooth transitions and adaptive decision-making in dynamic environments. This work bridges the gap between model-based and adaptive trajectory planning approaches, offering a stable solution for real-world autonomous driving applications.

Title: Real-Time Piano Note Frequency Detection Using FPGA and FFT Core
Authors: Shafayet M. Anik, D.G. Perera
Abstract: Real-time frequency analysis of musical instruments, such as the piano, is an essential feature in areas like electronic tuners, music visualizers, and live sound monitoring. Traditional methods often rely on software-based digital signal processing (DSP), which may introduce latency and require significant computational power. In contrast, hardware platforms such as FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) offer the ability to perform such analyses with greater speed and determinism due to their parallel processing capabilities. The primary objective of this project was to analyze analog audio signals from a digital piano using an FPGA-based real-time Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) system.

Title: Vehicle-in-Virtual-Environment (VVE) Method for Developing and Evaluating VRU Safety of Connected and Autonomous Driving with Focus on Bicyclist Safety
Authors: Haochong Chen, Xincheng Cao, Bilin Aksun-Guvenc, Levent Guvenc
Abstract: Extensive research has already been conducted in the autonomous driving field to help vehicles navigate safely and efficiently. At the same time, plenty of current research on vulnerable road user (VRU) safety is performed which largely concentrates on perception, localization, or trajectory prediction of VRUs. However, existing research still exhibits several gaps, including the lack of a unified planning and collision avoidance system for autonomous vehicles, limited investigation into delay tolerant control strategies, and the absence of an efficient and standardized testing methodology. Ensuring VRU safety remains one of the most pressing challenges in autonomous driving, particularly in dynamic and unpredictable environments. In this two year project, we focused on applying the Vehicle in Virtual Environment (VVE) method to develop, evaluate, and demonstrate safety functions for Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) using automated steering and braking of ADS. In this current second year project report, our primary focus was on enhancing the previous year results while also considering bicyclist safety.

Title: A Risk-aware Spatial-temporal Trajectory Planning Framework for Autonomous Vehicles Using QP-MPC and Dynamic Hazard Fields
Authors: Zhen Tian, Zhihao Lin, Dezong Zhao, Christos Anagnostopoulos, Qiyuan Wang, Wenjing Zhao, Xiaodan Wang, Chongfeng Wei
Abstract: Trajectory planning is a critical component in ensuring the safety, stability, and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. While existing trajectory planning methods have achieved progress, they often suffer from high computational costs, unstable performance in dynamic environments, and limited validation across diverse scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose an enhanced QP-MPC-based framework that incorporates three key innovations: (i) a novel cost function designed with a dynamic hazard field, which explicitly balances safety, efficiency, and comfort; (ii) seamless integration of this cost function into the QP-MPC formulation, enabling direct optimization of desired driving behaviors; and (iii) extensive validation of the proposed framework across complex tasks. The spatial safe planning is guided by a dynamic hazard field (DHF) for risk assessment, while temporal safe planning is based on a space-time graph. Besides, the quintic polynomial sampling and sub-reward of comforts are used to ensure comforts during lane-changing. The sub-reward of efficiency is used to maintain driving efficiency. Finally, the proposed DHF-enhanced objective function integrates multiple objectives, providing a proper optimization tasks for QP-MPC. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms benchmark optimization methods in terms of efficiency, stability, and comfort across a variety of scenarios likes lane-changing, overtaking, and crossing intersections.

Title: The Name-Free Gap: Policy-Aware Stylistic Control in Music Generation
Authors: Ashwin Nagarajan, Hao-Wen Dong
Abstract: Text-to-music models capture broad attributes such as instrumentation or mood, but fine-grained stylistic control remains an open challenge. Existing stylization methods typically require retraining or specialized conditioning, which complicates reproducibility and limits policy compliance when artist names are restricted. We study whether lightweight, human-readable modifiers sampled from a large language model can provide a policy-robust alternative for stylistic control. Using MusicGen-small, we evaluate two artists: Billie Eilish (vocal pop) and Ludovico Einaudi (instrumental piano). For each artist, we use fifteen reference excerpts and evaluate matched seeds under three conditions: baseline prompts, artist-name prompts, and five descriptor sets. All prompts are generated using a large language model. Evaluation uses both VGGish and CLAP embeddings with distributional and per-clip similarity measures, including a new min-distance attribution metric. Results show that artist names are the strongest control signal across both artists, while name-free descriptors recover much of this effect. This highlights that existing safeguards such as the restriction of artist names in music generation prompts may not fully prevent style imitation. Cross-artist transfers reduce alignment, showing that descriptors encode targeted stylistic cues. We also present a descriptor table across ten contemporary artists to illustrate the breadth of the tokens. Together these findings define the name-free gap, the controllability difference between artist-name prompts and policy-compliant descriptors, shown through a reproducible evaluation protocol for prompt-level controllability.

Title: PicoAudio2: Temporal Controllable Text-to-Audio Generation with Natural Language Description
Authors: Zihao Zheng, Zeyu Xie, Xuenan Xu, Wen Wu, Chao Zhang, Mengyue Wu
Abstract: Controllable text-to-audio generation (TTA) has attracted much attention recently. Although existing works can achieve fine-grained controllability based on timestamp information, sound event categories are limited to a fixed set. Moreover, since only simulated data is used for training, the generated audio quality and generalization performance on real data are limited. To tackle this issue, we propose PicoAudio2, improving temporal-controllable TTA via a new data processing pipeline and model architecture. Specifically, we use a grounding model to annotate event timestamps of real audio-text datasets to curate temporally-strong real data, in addition to simulation data from existing works. The model is trained on the combination of real and simulation data. Moreover, following PicoAudio, we encode timestamp information into a timestamp matrix to provide extra fine-grained time-aligned information to the model, on top of the coarse-grained textual description. Experiments show that PicoAudio2 exhibits superior performance in terms of temporal controllability and audio quality.

Title: Dynamic control of stochastic matching systems in heavy traffic: An effective computational method for high-dimensional problems
Authors: Baris Ata, Yaosheng Xu
Abstract: Bipartite matching systems arise in many settings where agents or tasks from two distinct sets must be paired dynamically under compatibility constraints. We consider a high-dimensional bipartite matching system under uncertainty and seek an effective dynamic control policy that maximizes the expected discounted total value generated by the matches minus the congestion-related costs. To derive a tractable approximation, we focus attention on balanced, high-volume systems, i.e., the heavy-traffic regime, and derive an approximating Brownian control problem. We then develop a computational method that relies on deep neural network technology for solving this problem. To show the effectiveness of the policy derived from our computational method, we compare it to the benchmark policies available in the extant literature in the context of the original matching problem. In the test problems attempted thus far, our proposed policy outperforms the benchmarks, and its derivation is computationally feasible for dimensions up to 100 or more.

Title: AImoclips: A Benchmark for Evaluating Emotion Conveyance in Text-to-Music Generation
Authors: Gyehun Go, Satbyul Han, Ahyeon Choi, Eunjin Choi, Juhan Nam, Jeong Mi Park
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-music (TTM) generation have enabled controllable and expressive music creation using natural language prompts. However, the emotional fidelity of TTM systems remains largely underexplored compared to human preference or text alignment. In this study, we introduce AImoclips, a benchmark for evaluating how well TTM systems convey intended emotions to human listeners, covering both open-source and commercial models. We selected 12 emotion intents spanning four quadrants of the valence-arousal space, and used six state-of-the-art TTM systems to generate over 1,000 music clips. A total of 111 participants rated the perceived valence and arousal of each clip on a 9-point Likert scale. Our results show that commercial systems tend to produce music perceived as more pleasant than intended, while open-source systems tend to perform the opposite. Emotions are more accurately conveyed under high-arousal conditions across all models. Additionally, all systems exhibit a bias toward emotional neutrality, highlighting a key limitation in affective controllability. This benchmark offers valuable insights into model-specific emotion rendering characteristics and supports future development of emotionally aligned TTM systems.

Title: Adaptive Vehicle Speed Classification via BMCNN with Reinforcement Learning-Enhanced Acoustic Processing
Authors: Yuli Zhang, Pengfei Fan, Ruiyuan Jiang, Hankang Gu, Dongyao Jia, Xinheng Wang
Abstract: Traffic congestion remains a pressing urban challenge, requiring intelligent transportation systems for real-time management. We present a hybrid framework that combines deep learning and reinforcement learning for acoustic vehicle speed classification. A dual-branch BMCNN processes MFCC and wavelet features to capture complementary frequency patterns. An attention-enhanced DQN adaptively selects the minimal number of audio frames and triggers early decisions once confidence thresholds are reached. Evaluations on IDMT-Traffic and our SZUR-Acoustic (Suzhou) datasets show 95.99% and 92.3% accuracy, with up to 1.63x faster average processing via early termination. Compared with A3C, DDDQN, SA2C, PPO, and TD3, the method provides a superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off and is suitable for real-time ITS deployment in heterogeneous urban environments.

Title: Speech Command Recognition Using LogNNet Reservoir Computing for Embedded Systems
Authors: Yuriy Izotov, Andrei Velichko
Abstract: This paper presents a low-resource speech-command recognizer combining energy-based voice activity detection (VAD), an optimized Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) pipeline, and the LogNNet reservoir-computing classifier. Using four commands from the Speech Commands da-taset downsampled to 8 kHz, we evaluate four MFCC aggregation schemes and find that adaptive binning (64-dimensional feature vector) offers the best accuracy-to-compactness trade-off. The LogNNet classifier with architecture 64:33:9:4 reaches 92.04% accuracy under speaker-independent evaluation, while requiring significantly fewer parameters than conventional deep learn-ing models. Hardware implementation on Arduino Nano 33 IoT (ARM Cor-tex-M0+, 48 MHz, 32 KB RAM) validates the practical feasibility, achieving ~90% real-time recognition accuracy while consuming only 18 KB RAM (55% utilization). The complete pipeline (VAD -> MFCC -> LogNNet) thus enables reliable on-device speech-command recognition under strict memory and compute limits, making it suitable for battery-powered IoT nodes, wire-less sensor networks, and hands-free control interfaces.

Title: Controller synthesis method for multi-agent system based on temporal logic specification
Authors: Ruohan Huang, Zining Cao
Abstract: Controller synthesis is a theoretical approach to the systematic design of discrete event systems. It constructs a controller to provide feedback and control to the system, ensuring it meets specified control specifications. Traditional controller synthesis methods often use formal languages to describe control specifications and are mainly oriented towards single-agent and non-probabilistic systems. With the increasing complexity of systems, the control requirements that need to be satisfied also become more complex. Based on this, this paper proposes a controller synthesis method for semi-cooperative semi-competitive multi-agent probabilistic discrete event systems to solve the controller synthesis problem based on temporal logic specifications. The controller can ensure the satisfaction of specifications to a certain extent. The specification is given in the form of a linear temporal logic formula. This paper designs a controller synthesis algorithm that combines probabilistic model checking. Finally, the effectiveness of this method is verified through a case study.

Title: Movable Antenna-Enhanced Secure Communication: Opportunities, Challenges, and Solutions
Authors: Yaodong Ma, Kai Liu, Lipeng Zhu, Yanming Liu, Yanbo Zhu, Daniel Benevides da Costa
Abstract: The broadcast nature of wireless communication renders it inherently vulnerable to security threats such as jamming and eavesdropping. While traditional array beamforming techniques help to mitigate these threats, they usually incur high hardware and processing costs, particularly in large-scale arrays with fixed-position antennas (FPAs). In contrast, movable antenna (MA) arrays can fully exploit the channel variation in spatial regions by enabling flexible antenna movement, which has emerged as a promising technology for secure communications. This article provides a magazine-type overview of MA-aided secure communications. Specifically, we first illuminate the promising application scenarios for MA-enhanced secure communication systems. Then, we examine the security advantages of MAs over conventional FPA systems, fundamentally stemming from their ability to adjust channel correlations between legitimate users, eavesdroppers, and jammers. Furthermore, we discuss important technical challenges and their potential solutions related to MA hardware architecture, channel acquisition, and antenna position optimization to realize secure transmissions. Finally, several promising directions for MA-aided secure communications are presented to inspire future research.

Title: Hybrid AI-Driven Intrusion Detection: Framework Leveraging Novel Feature Selection for Enhanced Network Security
Authors: Maryam Mahdi Alhusseini, Mohammad Reza Feizi Derakhshi
Abstract: In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, safeguarding network infrastructures against cyberattacks has become a critical priority. This research presents an innovative AI-driven real-time intrusion detection framework designed to enhance network security, particularly in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Cloud Computing (CC) environments. The system employs classical machine learning models, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors, optimized through the novel Energy Valley Optimization (EVO) method using the NSL-KDD dataset. Feature selection significantly reduced the number of input features from 42 to 18 while maintaining strong detection capabilities. The proposed system achieved 98.95 percent accuracy with Decision Tree, 98.47 percent with K-Nearest Neighbors, and 88.84 percent with Logistic Regression. Moreover, high precision, recall, and F1-scores were attained across all classifiers while substantially reducing training and testing times, making the framework highly suitable for real-time applications. To ensure fair detection across diverse attack types, dataset balancing via downsampling was applied to address class imbalance challenges. This investigation focuses on the significance of advancing intrusion detection systems in cloud computing and WSNs. Overall, this work advances secure communications by delivering a scalable, low-latency, and high-accuracy intrusion detection solution aligned with the latest trends in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and real-time digital networks

Title: Movable Antenna Empowered Secure Near-Field MIMO Communications
Authors: Yaodong Ma, Kai Liu, Yanming Liu, Lipeng Zhu
Abstract: This paper investigates movable antenna (MA) empowered secure transmission in near-field multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, where the base station (BS) equipped with an MA array transmits confidential information to a legitimate user under the threat of a potential eavesdropper. To enhance physical layer security (PLS) of the considered system, we aim to maximize the secrecy rate by jointly designing the hybrid digital and analog beamformers, as well as the positions of MAs at the BS. To solve the formulated non-convex problem with highly coupled variables, an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm is introduced by decoupling the original problem into two separate subproblems. Specifically, for the subproblem of designing hybrid beamformers, a semi-closed-form solution for the fully-digital beamformer is first derived by a weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE)-based algorithm. Subsequently, the digital and analog beamformers are determined by approximating the fully-digital beamformer through the manifold optimization (MO) technique. For the MA positions design subproblem, we utilize the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm to iteratively optimize each MA's position while keeping others fixed. Extensive simulation results validate the considerable benefits of the proposed MA-aided near-field beam focusing approach in enhancing security performance compared to the traditional far-field and/or the fixed position antenna (FPA)-based systems. In addition, the proposed scheme can realize secure transmission even if the eavesdropper is located in the same direction as the user and closer to the BS.

Title: TinyMusician: On-Device Music Generation with Knowledge Distillation and Mixed Precision Quantization
Authors: Hainan Wang, Mehdi Hosseinzadeh, Reza Rawassizadeh
Abstract: The success of the generative model has gained unprecedented attention in the music generation area. Transformer-based architectures have set new benchmarks for model performance. However, their practical adoption is hindered by some critical challenges: the demand for massive computational resources and inference time, due to their large number of parameters. These obstacles make them infeasible to deploy on edge devices, such as smartphones and wearables, with limited computational resources. In this work, we present TinyMusician, a lightweight music generation model distilled from MusicGen (a State-of-the-art music generation model). TinyMusician integrates two innovations: (i) Stage-mixed Bidirectional and Skewed KL-Divergence and (ii) Adaptive Mixed-Precision Quantization. The experimental results demonstrate that TinyMusician retains 93% of the MusicGen-Small performance with 55% less model size. TinyMusician is the first mobile-deployable music generation model that eliminates cloud dependency while maintaining high audio fidelity and efficient resource usage

Title: IoT-based Noise Monitoring using Mobile Nodes for Smart Cities
Authors: Bhima Sankar Manthina (1), Shreyash Gujar (1), Sachin Chaudhari (1), Kavita Vemuri1 (1), Shivam Chhirolya (2) ((1) International Institute of Information Technology-Hyderabad (IIIT-H), India, (2) <a href="http://Prezent.AI" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-http">this http URL</a>, India)
Abstract: Urban noise pollution poses a significant threat to public health, yet existing monitoring infrastructures offer limited spatial coverage and adaptability. This paper presents a scalable, low-cost, IoT-based, real-time environmental noise monitoring solution using mobile nodes (sensor nodes on a moving vehicle). The system utilizes a low-cost sound sensor integrated with GPS-enabled modules to collect geotagged noise data at one-second intervals. The sound nodes are calibrated against a reference sound level meter in a laboratory setting to ensure accuracy using various machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as Simple Linear Regression (SLR), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Polynomial Regression (PR), Segmented Regression (SR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest Regression (RFR). While laboratory calibration demonstrates high accuracy, it is shown that the performance of the nodes degrades during data collection in a moving vehicle. To address this, it is demonstrated that the calibration must be performed on the IoT-based node based on the data collected in a moving environment along with the reference device. Among the employed ML models, RFR achieved the best performance with an R2 of 0.937 and RMSE of 1.09 for mobile calibration. The system was deployed in Hyderabad, India, through three measurement campaigns across 27 days, capturing 436,420 data points. Results highlight temporal and spatial noise variations across weekdays, weekends, and during Diwali. Incorporating vehicular velocity into the calibration significantly improves accuracy. The proposed system demonstrates the potential for widespread deployment of IoT-based noise sensing networks in smart cities, enabling effective noise pollution management and urban planning.

Title: A Unified Denoising and Adaptation Framework for Self-Supervised Bengali Dialectal ASR
Authors: Swadhin Biswas, Imran, Tuhin Sheikh
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for Bengali, the world's fifth most spoken language, remains a significant challenge, critically hindering technological accessibility for its over 270 million speakers. This challenge is compounded by two persistent and intertwined factors: the language's vast dialectal diversity and the prevalence of acoustic noise in real-world environments. While state-of-the-art self-supervised learning (SSL) models have advanced ASR for low-resource languages, they often lack explicit mechanisms to handle environmental noise during pre-training or specialized adaptation strategies for the complex phonetic and lexical variations across Bengali dialects. This paper introduces a novel, unified framework designed to address these dual challenges simultaneously. Our approach is founded on the WavLM model, which is uniquely pre-trained with a masked speech denoising objective, making it inherently robust to acoustic distortions. We propose a specialized multi-stage fine-tuning strategy that first adapts the model to general-domain standard Bengali to establish a strong linguistic foundation and subsequently specializes it for noise-robust dialectal recognition through targeted data augmentation. The framework is rigorously evaluated on a comprehensive benchmark comprising multiple Bengali dialects under a wide range of simulated noisy conditions, from clean audio to low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) levels. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms strong baselines, including standard fine-tuned wav2vec 2.0 and the large-scale multilingual Whisper model. This work establishes a new state-of-the-art for this task and provides a scalable, effective blueprint for developing practical ASR systems for other low-resource, high-variation languages globally.

Title: IMU-Enhanced EEG Motion Artifact Removal with Fine-Tuned Large Brain Models
Authors: Yuhong Zhang, Xusheng Zhu, Yuchen Xu, ChiaEn Lu, Hsinyu Shih, Gert Cauwenberghs, Tzyy-Ping Jung
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method for measuring brain activity with high temporal resolution; however, EEG signals often exhibit low signal-to-noise ratios because of contamination from physiological and environmental artifacts. One of the major challenges hindering the real-world deployment of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) involves the frequent occurrence of motion-related EEG artifacts. Most prior studies on EEG motion artifact removal rely on single-modality approaches, such as Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), without incorporating simultaneously recorded modalities like inertial measurement units (IMUs), which directly capture the extent and dynamics of motion. This work proposes a fine-tuned large brain model (LaBraM)-based correlation attention mapping method that leverages spatial channel relationships in IMU data to identify motion-related artifacts in EEG signals. The fine-tuned model contains approximately 9.2 million parameters and uses 5.9 hours of EEG and IMU recordings for training, just 0.2346\% of the 2500 hours used to train the base model. We compare our results against the established ASR-ICA benchmark across varying time scales and motion activities, showing that incorporating IMU reference signals significantly improves robustness under diverse motion scenarios.

Title: Is Noisy Data a Blessing in Disguise? A Distributionally Robust Optimization Perspective
Authors: Chung-Han Hsieh, Rong Gan
Abstract: Noisy data are often viewed as a challenge for decision-making. This paper studies a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) that shows how such noise can be systematically incorporated. Rather than applying DRO to the noisy empirical distribution, we construct ambiguity sets over the \emph{latent} distribution by centering a Wasserstein ball at the noisy empirical distribution in the observation space and taking its inverse image through a known noise kernel. We validate this inverse-image construction by deriving a tractable convex reformulation and establishing rigorous statistical guarantees, including finite-sample performance and asymptotic consistency. Crucially, we demonstrate that, under mild conditions, noisy data may be a ``blessing in disguise." Our noisy-data DRO model is less conservative than its direct counterpart, leading to provably higher optimal values and a lower price of ambiguity. In the context of fair resource allocation problems, we demonstrate that this robust approach can induce solutions that are structurally more equitable. Our findings suggest that managers can leverage uncertainty by harnessing noise as a source of robustness rather than treating it as an obstacle, producing more robust and strategically balanced decisions.

Title: SC-GIR: Goal-oriented Semantic Communication via Invariant Representation Learning
Authors: Senura Hansaja Wanasekara, Van-Dinh Nguyen, Kok-Seng, M.-Duong Nguyen, Symeon Chatzinotas, Octavia A. Dobre
Abstract: Goal-oriented semantic communication (SC) aims to revolutionize communication systems by transmitting only task-essential information. However, current approaches face challenges such as joint training at transceivers, leading to redundant data exchange and reliance on labeled datasets, which limits their task-agnostic utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called Goal-oriented Invariant Representation-based SC (SC-GIR) for image transmission. Our framework leverages self-supervised learning to extract an invariant representation that encapsulates crucial information from the source data, independent of the specific downstream task. This compressed representation facilitates efficient communication while retaining key features for successful downstream task execution. Focusing on machine-to-machine tasks, we utilize covariance-based contrastive learning techniques to obtain a latent representation that is both meaningful and semantically dense. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme on downstream tasks, we apply it to various image datasets for lossy compression. The compressed representations are then used in a goal-oriented AI task. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that SC-GIR outperforms baseline schemes by nearly 10%,, and achieves over 85% classification accuracy for compressed data under different SNR conditions. These results underscore the effectiveness of the proposed framework in learning compact and informative latent representations.

Title: EZhouNet:A framework based on graph neural network and anchor interval for the respiratory sound event detection
Authors: Yun Chu, Qiuhao Wang, Enze Zhou, Qian Liu, Gang Zheng
Abstract: Auscultation is a key method for early diagnosis of respiratory and pulmonary diseases, relying on skilled healthcare professionals. However, the process is often subjective, with variability between experts. As a result, numerous deep learning-based automatic classification methods have emerged, most of which focus on respiratory sound classification. In contrast, research on respiratory sound event detection remains limited. Existing sound event detection methods typically rely on frame-level predictions followed by post-processing to generate event-level outputs, making interval boundaries challenging to learn directly. Furthermore, many approaches can only handle fixed-length audio, lim- iting their applicability to variable-length respiratory sounds. Additionally, the impact of respiratory sound location information on detection performance has not been extensively explored. To address these issues, we propose a graph neural network-based framework with anchor intervals, capable of handling variable-length audio and providing more precise temporal localization for abnormal respi- ratory sound events. Our method improves both the flexibility and applicability of respiratory sound detection. Experiments on the SPRSound 2024 and HF Lung V1 datasets demonstrate the effec- tiveness of the proposed approach, and incorporating respiratory position information enhances the discrimination between abnormal sounds.

Title: DynaMind: Reconstructing Dynamic Visual Scenes from EEG by Aligning Temporal Dynamics and Multimodal Semantics to Guided Diffusion
Authors: Junxiang Liu, Junming Lin, Jiangtong Li, Jie Li
Abstract: Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG) signals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low spatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and video dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain activity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper (RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal consistency between the feature representations and the original neural recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by 12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual semantics.

Title: On a closed-loop identification challenge in feedback optimization
Authors: Kristian Lindbäck Løvland, Lars Struen Imsland, Bjarne Grimstad
Abstract: Feedback optimization has emerged as an effective strategy for steady-state optimization of dynamical systems. By exploiting models of the steady-state input-output sensitivity, methods of this type are often sample efficient, and their use of feedback ensures that they are robust against model error. Still, this robustness has its limitations, and the dependence on a model may hinder convergence in settings with high model error. We investigate here the effect of a particular type of model error: bias due to identifying the model from closed-loop data. Our main results are a sufficient convergence condition, and a converse divergence condition. The convergence condition requires a matrix which depends on the closed-loop sensitivity and a noise-to-signal ratio of the data generating system to be positive definite. The negative definiteness of the same matrix characterizes an extreme case where the bias due to closed-loop data results in divergence of model-based feedback optimization.

Title: SimulMEGA: MoE Routers are Advanced Policy Makers for Simultaneous Speech Translation
Authors: Chenyang Le, Bing Han, Jinshun Li, Songyong Chen, Yanmin Qian
Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) enables real-time cross-lingual communication by jointly optimizing speech recognition and machine translation under strict latency constraints. Existing systems struggle to balance translation quality, latency, and semantic coherence, particularly in multilingual many-to-many scenarios where divergent read and write policies hinder unified strategy learning. In this paper, we present SimulMEGA (Simultaneous Generation by Mixture-of-Experts Gating), an unsupervised policy learning framework that combines prefix-based training with a Mixture-of-Experts refiner to learn effective read and write decisions in an implicit manner, without adding inference-time overhead. Our design requires only minimal modifications to standard transformer architectures and generalizes across both speech-to-text and text-to-speech streaming tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation on six language pairs, our 500M parameter speech-to-text model outperforms the Seamless baseline, achieving under 7 percent BLEU degradation at 1.5 seconds average lag and under 3 percent at 3 seconds. We further demonstrate the versatility of SimulMEGA by extending it to streaming TTS with a unidirectional backbone, yielding superior latency quality tradeoffs.

Abstract: This paper tackles two key challenges: detecting small, dense, and overlapping objects (a major hurdle in computer vision) and improving the quality of noisy images, especially those encountered in industrial environments. [1, 2]. Our focus is on evaluating methods built on supervised deep learning. We perform an analysis of these methods, using a newly de- veloped dataset comprising over 10k images and 120k in- stances.

This paper also examines the use of deep learning models to improve image quality in noisy industrial environments. We introduce a lightweight model based on a fully connected convolutional network. Addition- ally, we suggest potential future directions for further enhanc- ing the effectiveness of the model.

Title: Analysing the Language of Neural Audio Codecs
Authors: Joonyong Park, Shinnosuke Takamichi, David M. Chan, Shunsuke Kando, Yuki Saito, Hiroshi Saruwatari
Abstract: This study presents a comparative analysis of the statistical and linguistic properties of neural audio codecs (NACs). We investigate discrete speech tokens produced by various NAC models, examining their adherence to linguistic statistical laws such as Zipf's law and Heaps' law, as well as their entropy and redundancy. To assess how these token-level properties relate to semantic and acoustic preservation in synthesized speech, we evaluate intelligibility using error rates of automatic speech recognition, and quality using the UTMOS score. Our results reveal that NAC tokens, particularly 3-grams, exhibit language-like statistical patterns. Moreover, these properties, together with measures of information content, are found to correlate with improved performances in speech recognition and resynthesis tasks. These findings offer insights into the structure of NAC token sequences and inform the design of more effective generative speech models.

Title: CabinSep: IR-Augmented Mask-Based MVDR for Real-Time In-Car Speech Separation with Distributed Heterogeneous Arrays
Authors: Runduo Han, Yanxin Hu, Yihui Fu, Zihan Zhang, Yukai Jv, Li Chen, Lei Xie
Abstract: Separating overlapping speech from multiple speakers is crucial for effective human-vehicle interaction. This paper proposes CabinSep, a lightweight neural mask-based minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) speech separation approach, to reduce speech recognition errors in back-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models. Our contributions are threefold: First, we utilize channel information to extract spatial features, which improves the estimation of speech and noise masks. Second, we employ MVDR during inference, reducing speech distortion to make it more ASR-friendly. Third, we introduce a data augmentation method combining simulated and real-recorded impulse responses (IRs), improving speaker localization at zone boundaries and further reducing speech recognition errors. With a computational complexity of only 0.4 GMACs, CabinSep achieves a 17.5% relative reduction in speech recognition error rate in a real-recorded dataset compared to the state-of-the-art DualSep model. Demos are available at: this https URL.

Title: ArabEmoNet: A Lightweight Hybrid 2D CNN-BiLSTM Model with Attention for Robust Arabic Speech Emotion Recognition
Authors: Ali Abouzeid, Bilal Elbouardi, Mohamed Maged, Shady Shehata
Abstract: Speech emotion recognition is vital for human-computer interaction, particularly for low-resource languages like Arabic, which face challenges due to limited data and research. We introduce ArabEmoNet, a lightweight architecture designed to overcome these limitations and deliver state-of-the-art performance. Unlike previous systems relying on discrete MFCC features and 1D convolutions, which miss nuanced spectro-temporal patterns, ArabEmoNet uses Mel spectrograms processed through 2D convolutions, preserving critical emotional cues often lost in traditional methods. While recent models favor large-scale architectures with millions of parameters, ArabEmoNet achieves superior results with just 1 million parameters, 90 times smaller than HuBERT base and 74 times smaller than Whisper. This efficiency makes it ideal for resource-constrained environments. ArabEmoNet advances Arabic speech emotion recognition, offering exceptional performance and accessibility for real-world applications.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to system identification for nonlinear input-output models by minimizing the simulation error and formulating it as a constrained optimization problem. This method addresses vanishing gradient issues, enabling faster convergence than traditional gradient-based methods. We present an algorithm that utilizes feedback-linearization controlled multipliers optimization and provide a theoretical analysis of its performance. We prove that the algorithm converges to a local minimum, and we optimize the computational efficiency by leveraging the problem structure. Numerical experiments illustrate that our approach outperforms gradient-based methods in computational effort and accuracy.

Title: Structured AI Decision-Making in Disaster Management
Authors: Julian Gerald Dcruz, Argyrios Zolotas, Niall Ross Greenwood, Miguel Arana-Catania
Abstract: With artificial intelligence (AI) being applied to bring autonomy to decision-making in safety-critical domains such as the ones typified in the aerospace and emergency-response services, there has been a call to address the ethical implications of structuring those decisions, so they remain reliable and justifiable when human lives are at stake. This paper contributes to addressing the challenge of decision-making by proposing a structured decision-making framework as a foundational step towards responsible AI. The proposed structured decision-making framework is implemented in autonomous decision-making, specifically within disaster management. By introducing concepts of Enabler agents, Levels and Scenarios, the proposed framework's performance is evaluated against systems relying solely on judgement-based insights, as well as human operators who have disaster experience: victims, volunteers, and stakeholders. The results demonstrate that the structured decision-making framework achieves 60.94% greater stability in consistently accurate decisions across multiple Scenarios, compared to judgement-based systems. Moreover, the study shows that the proposed framework outperforms human operators with a 38.93% higher accuracy across various Scenarios. These findings demonstrate the promise of the structured decision-making framework for building more reliable autonomous AI applications in safety-critical contexts.

Title: From Discord to Harmony: Decomposed Consonance-based Training for Improved Audio Chord Estimation
Authors: Andrea Poltronieri, Xavier Serra, Martín Rocamora
Abstract: Audio Chord Estimation (ACE) holds a pivotal role in music information research, having garnered attention for over two decades due to its relevance for music transcription and analysis. Despite notable advancements, challenges persist in the task, particularly concerning unique characteristics of harmonic content, which have resulted in existing systems' performances reaching a glass ceiling. These challenges include annotator subjectivity, where varying interpretations among annotators lead to inconsistencies, and class imbalance within chord datasets, where certain chord classes are over-represented compared to others, posing difficulties in model training and evaluation. As a first contribution, this paper presents an evaluation of inter-annotator agreement in chord annotations, using metrics that extend beyond traditional binary measures. In addition, we propose a consonance-informed distance metric that reflects the perceptual similarity between harmonic annotations. Our analysis suggests that consonance-based distance metrics more effectively capture musically meaningful agreement between annotations. Expanding on these findings, we introduce a novel ACE conformer-based model that integrates consonance concepts into the model through consonance-based label smoothing. The proposed model also addresses class imbalance by separately estimating root, bass, and all note activations, enabling the reconstruction of chord labels from decomposed outputs.

Title: Securing Radiation Detection Systems with an Efficient TinyML-Based IDS for Edge Devices
Authors: Einstein Rivas Pizarro, Wajiha Zaheer, Li Yang, Khalil El-Khatib, Glenn Harvel
Abstract: Radiation Detection Systems (RDSs) play a vital role in ensuring public safety across various settings, from nuclear facilities to medical environments. However, these systems are increasingly vulnerable to cyber-attacks such as data injection, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, ICMP floods, botnet attacks, privilege escalation, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Such threats could compromise the integrity and reliability of radiation measurements, posing significant public health and safety risks. This paper presents a new synthetic radiation dataset and an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) tailored for resource-constrained environments, bringing Machine Learning (ML) predictive capabilities closer to the sensing edge layer of critical infrastructure. Leveraging TinyML techniques, the proposed IDS employs an optimized XGBoost model enhanced with pruning, quantization, feature selection, and sampling. These TinyML techniques significantly reduce the size of the model and computational demands, enabling real-time intrusion detection on low-resource devices while maintaining a reasonable balance between efficiency and accuracy.

Title: An Efficient Intrusion Detection System for Safeguarding Radiation Detection Systems
Authors: Nathanael Coolidge, Jaime González Sanz, Li Yang, Khalil El Khatib, Glenn Harvel, Nelson Agbemava, I Putu Susila, Mehmet Yavuz Yagci
Abstract: Radiation Detection Systems (RDSs) are used to measure and detect abnormal levels of radioactive material in the environment. These systems are used in many applications to mitigate threats posed by high levels of radioactive material. However, these systems lack protection against malicious external attacks to modify the data. The novelty of applying Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in RDSs is a crucial element in safeguarding these critical infrastructures. While IDSs are widely used in networking environments to safeguard against various attacks, their application in RDSs is novel. A common attack on RDSs is Denial of Service (DoS), where the attacker aims to overwhelm the system, causing malfunctioning RDSs. This paper proposes an efficient Machine Learning (ML)-based IDS to detect anomalies in radiation data, focusing on DoS attacks. This work explores the use of sampling methods to create a simulated DoS attack based on a real radiation dataset, followed by an evaluation of various ML algorithms, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), logistic regression, and Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM), to detect DoS attacks on RDSs. LightGBM is emphasized for its superior accuracy and low computational resource consumption, making it particularly suitable for real-time intrusion detection. Additionally, model optimization and TinyML techniques, including feature selection, parallel execution, and random search methods, are used to improve the efficiency of the proposed IDS. Finally, an optimized and efficient LightGBM-based IDS is developed to achieve accurate intrusion detection for RDSs.

Title: Learning to Coordinate: Distributed Meta-Trajectory Optimization Via Differentiable ADMM-DDP
Authors: Bingheng Wang, Yichao Gao, Tianchen Sun, Lin Zhao
Abstract: Distributed trajectory optimization via ADMM-DDP is a powerful approach for coordinating multi-agent systems, but it requires extensive tuning of tightly coupled hyperparameters that jointly govern local task performance and global coordination. In this paper, we propose Learning to Coordinate (L2C), a general framework that meta-learns these hyperparameters, modeled by lightweight agent-wise neural networks, to adapt across diverse tasks and agent configurations. L2C differentiates end-to-end through the ADMM-DDP pipeline in a distributed manner. It also enables efficient meta-gradient computation by reusing DDP components such as Riccati recursions and feedback gains. These gradients correspond to the optimal solutions of distributed matrix-valued LQR problems, coordinated across agents via an auxiliary ADMM framework that becomes convex under mild assumptions. Training is further accelerated by truncating iterations and meta-learning ADMM penalty parameters optimized for rapid residual reduction, with provable Lipschitz-bounded gradient errors. On a challenging cooperative aerial transport task, L2C generates dynamically feasible trajectories in high-fidelity simulation using IsaacSIM, reconfigures quadrotor formations for safe 6-DoF load manipulation in tight spaces, and adapts robustly to varying team sizes and task conditions, while achieving up to $88\%$ faster gradient computation than state-of-the-art methods.

Title: A QoS Framework for Service Provision in Multi-Infrastructure-Sharing Networks
Authors: Quang Minh Nguyen, Eytan Modiano
Abstract: We propose a framework for resource provisioning with QoS guarantees in shared infrastructure networks. Our novel framework provides tunable probabilistic service guarantees for throughput and delay. Key to our approach is a Modified Dirft-plus-Penalty (MDP) policy that ensures long-term stability while capturing short-term probabilistic service guarantees using linearized upper-confidence bounds. We characterize the feasible region of service guarantees and show that our MDP procedure achieves mean rate stability and an optimality gap that vanishes with the frame size over which service guarantees are provided. Finally, empirical simulations validate our theory and demonstrate the favorable performance of our algorithm in handling QoS in multi-infrastructure networks.

Authors: Hojjat Farshadinia, Ali Barati, Hamid Barati
Abstract: This paper presents a novel multi-layered hybrid security approach aimed at enhancing lightweight encryption for IoT-Cloud systems. The primary goal is to overcome limitations inherent in conventional solutions such as TPA, Blockchain, ECDSA and ZSS which often fall short in terms of data protection, computational efficiency and scalability. Our proposed method strategically refines and integrates these technologies to address their shortcomings while maximizing their individual strengths. By doing so we create a more reliable and high-performance framework for secure data exchange across heterogeneous environments. The model leverages the combined potential of emerging technologies, particularly Blockchain, IoT and Cloud computing which when effectively coordinated offer significant advancements in security architecture. The proposed framework consists of three core layers: (1) the this http URL Layer which integrates improved versions of Hyperledger Fabric, Enc-Block and a hybrid ECDSA-ZSS scheme to improve encryption speed, scalability and reduce computational cost; (2) the Credential Management Layer independently verifying data integrity and authenticity; and (3) the Time and Auditing Layer designed to reduce traffic overhead and optimize performance across dynamic workloads. Evaluation results highlight that the proposed solution not only strengthens security but also significantly improves execution time, communication efficiency and system responsiveness, offering a robust path forward for next-generation IoT-Cloud infrastructures.

Title: An intrusion detection system in internet of things using grasshopper optimization algorithm and machine learning algorithms
Authors: Shiva Sattarpour, Ali Barati, Hamid Barati
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a foundational paradigm supporting a range of applications, including healthcare, education, agriculture, smart homes, and, more recently, enterprise systems. However, significant advancements in IoT networks have been impeded by security vulnerabilities and threats that, if left unaddressed, could hinder the deployment and operation of IoT based systems. Detecting unwanted activities within the IoT is crucial, as it directly impacts confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Consequently, intrusion detection has become a fundamental research area and the focus of numerous studies. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is essential to the IoTs alarm mechanisms, enabling effective security management. This paper examines IoT security and introduces an intelligent two-layer intrusion detection system for IoT. Machine learning techniques power the system's intelligence, with a two layer structure enhancing intrusion detection. By selecting essential features, the system maintains detection accuracy while minimizing processing overhead. The proposed method for intrusion detection in IoT is implemented in two phases. In the first phase, the Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) is applied for feature selection. In the second phase, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is used to detect intrusions. The method was implemented in MATLAB, and the NSLKDD dataset was used for evaluation. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves accuracy compared to other approaches.

Abstract: Machine learning has recently been adopted to emulate sensitivity matrices for real-time magnetic control of tokamak plasmas. However, these approaches would benefit from a quantification of possible inaccuracies. We report on two aspects of real-time applicability of emulators. First, we quantify the agreement of target displacement from VCs computed via Jacobians of the shape emulators with those from finite differences Jacobians on exact Grad-Shafranov solutions. Good agreement ($\approx$5-10%) can be achieved on a selection of geometric targets using combinations of neural network emulators with $\approx10^5$ parameters. A sample of $\approx10^{5}-10^{6}$ synthetic equilibria is essential to train emulators that are not over-regularised or overfitting. Smaller models trained on the shape targets may be further fine-tuned to better fit the Jacobians. Second, we address the effect of vessel currents that are not directly measured in real-time and are typically subsumed into effective "shaping currents" when designing virtual circuits. We demonstrate that shaping currents can be inferred via simple linear regression on a trailing window of active coil current measurements with residuals of only a few Ampères, enabling a choice for the most appropriate shaping currents at any point in a shot. While these results are based on historic shot data and simulations tailored to MAST-U, they indicate that emulators with few-millisecond latency can be developed for robust real-time plasma shape control in existing and upcoming tokamaks.

Title: Quantum Machine Learning for UAV Swarm Intrusion Detection
Authors: Kuan-Cheng Chen, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Tai-Yue Li, Chen-Yu Liu, Kin K. Leung
Abstract: Intrusion detection in unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) swarms is complicated by high mobility, non-stationary traffic, and severe class imbalance. Leveraging a 120 k-flow simulation corpus that covers five attack types, we benchmark three quantum-machine-learning (QML) approaches - quantum kernels, variational quantum neural networks (QNNs), and hybrid quantum-trained neural networks (QT-NNs) - against strong classical baselines. All models consume an 8-feature flow representation and are evaluated under identical preprocessing, balancing, and noise-model assumptions. We analyse the influence of encoding strategy, circuit depth, qubit count, and shot noise, reporting accuracy, macro-F1, ROC-AUC, Matthews correlation, and quantum-resource footprints. Results reveal clear trade-offs: quantum kernels and QT-NNs excel in low-data, nonlinear regimes, while deeper QNNs suffer from trainability issues, and CNNs dominate when abundant data offset their larger parameter count. The complete codebase and dataset partitions are publicly released to enable reproducible QML research in network security.

Title: A Million-Point Fast Trajectory Optimization Solver
Authors: A. Javeed, D. P. Kouri, D. Ridzal, J. D. Steinman, I. M. Ross
Abstract: One might argue that solving a trajectory optimization problem over a million grid points is preposterous. How about solving such a problem at an incredibly fast computational time? On a small form-factor processor? Algorithmic details that make possible this trifecta of breakthroughs are presented in this paper. The computational mathematics that deliver these advancements are: (i) a Birkhoff-theoretic discretization of optimal control problems, (ii) matrix-free linear algebra leveraging Krylov-subspace methods, and (iii) a near-perfect Birkhoff preconditioner that helps achieve $\mathcal{O}(1)$ iteration speed with respect to the grid size,~$N$. A key enabler of this high performance is the computation of Birkhoff matrix-vector products at $\mathcal{O}(N\log(N))$ time using fast Fourier transform techniques that eliminate traditional computational bottlenecks. A numerical demonstration of this unprecedented scale and speed is illustrated for a practical astrodynamics problem.

Title: Semi-on-Demand Transit Feeders with Shared Autonomous Vehicles and Reinforcement-Learning-Based Zonal Dispatching Control
Authors: Max T.M. Ng, Roman Engelhardt, Florian Dandl, Hani S. Mahmassani, Klaus Bogenberger
Abstract: This paper develops a semi-on-demand transit feeder service using shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) and zonal dispatching control based on reinforcement learning (RL). This service combines the cost-effectiveness of fixed-route transit with the adaptability of demand-responsive transport to improve accessibility in lower-density areas. Departing from the terminus, SAVs first make scheduled fixed stops, then offer on-demand pick-ups and drop-offs in a pre-determined flexible-route area. Our deep RL model dynamically assigns vehicles to subdivided flexible-route zones in response to real-time demand fluctuations and operations, using a policy gradient algorithm - Proximal Policy Optimization. The methodology is demonstrated through agent-based simulations on a real-world bus route in Munich, Germany. Results show that after efficient training of the RL model, the semi-on-demand service with dynamic zonal control serves 16% more passengers at 13% higher generalized costs on average compared to traditional fixed-route service. The efficiency gain brought by RL control brings 2.4% more passengers at 1.4% higher costs. This study not only showcases the potential of integrating SAV feeders and machine learning techniques into public transit, but also sets the groundwork for further innovations in addressing first-mile-last-mile problems in multimodal transit systems.

Title: Hybrid Autonomy Framework for a Future Mars Science Helicopter
Authors: Luca Di Pierno, Robert Hewitt, Stephan Weiss, Roland Brockers
Abstract: Autonomous aerial vehicles, such as NASA's Ingenuity, enable rapid planetary surface exploration beyond the reach of ground-based robots. Thus, NASA is studying a Mars Science Helicopter (MSH), an advanced concept capable of performing long-range science missions and autonomously navigating challenging Martian terrain. Given significant Earth-Mars communication delays and mission complexity, an advanced autonomy framework is required to ensure safe and efficient operation by continuously adapting behavior based on mission objectives and real-time conditions, without human intervention. This study presents a deterministic high-level control framework for aerial exploration, integrating a Finite State Machine (FSM) with Behavior Trees (BTs) to achieve a scalable, robust, and computationally efficient autonomy solution for critical scenarios like deep space exploration. In this paper we outline key capabilities of a possible MSH and detail the FSM-BT hybrid autonomy framework which orchestrates them to achieve the desired objectives. Monte Carlo simulations and real field tests validate the framework, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability to both discrete events and real-time system feedback. These inputs trigger state transitions or dynamically adjust behavior execution, enabling reactive and context-aware responses. The framework is middleware-agnostic, supporting integration with systems like F-Prime and extending beyond aerial robotics.

Title: FireRedTTS-2: Towards Long Conversational Speech Generation for Podcast and Chatbot
Authors: Kun Xie, Feiyu Shen, Junjie Li, Fenglong Xie, Xu Tang, Yao Hu
Abstract: Current dialogue generation approaches typically require the complete dialogue text before synthesis and produce a single, inseparable speech containing all voices, making them unsuitable for interactive chat; moreover, they suffer from unstable synthesis, inaccurate speaker transitions, and incoherent prosody. In this work, we present FireRedTTS-2, a long-form streaming TTS system for multi-speaker dialogue generation, delivering stable, natural speech with reliable speaker switching and context-aware prosody. A new 12.5Hz streaming speech tokenizer accelerates training and inference, extends maximum dialogue length, encodes richer semantics to stabilize text-to-token modeling and supports high-fidelity streaming generation for real-time applications. We adopt a text-speech interleaved format, concatenating speaker-labeled text with aligned speech tokens in chronological order, and model it with a dual-transformer: a large decoder-only transformer predicts tokens at the first layer, and a smaller one completes subsequent layers. Experimental results show that FireRedTTS-2 integrates seamlessly with chat frameworks and, with minimal fine-tuning, produces emotionally expressive speech guided by implicit contextual cues. In podcast generation, it surpasses existing systems including MoonCast, Zipvoice-Dialogue, and MOSS-TTSD in objective intelligibility, speaker-turn reliability, and perceived naturalness with context-consistent prosody. Our demos are available at this https URL.

Title: Green Traffic Engineering for Satellite Networks Using Segment Routing Flexible Algorithm
Authors: Jintao Liang, Pablo G. Madoery, Chung-Horng Lung, Halim Yanikomeroglu, Gunes Karabulut Kurt
Abstract: Large-scale low-Earth-orbit (LEO) constellations demand routing that simultaneously minimizes energy, guarantees delivery under congestion, and meets latency requirements for time-critical flows. We present a segment routing over IPv6 (SRv6) flexible algorithm (Flex-Algo) framework that consists of three logical slices: an energy-efficient slice (Algo 130), a high-reliability slice (Algo 129), and a latency-sensitive slice (Algo 128). The framework provides a unified mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that combines satellite CPU power, packet delivery rate (PDR), and end-to-end latency into a single objective, allowing a lightweight software-defined network (SDN) controller to steer traffic from the source node. Emulation of Telesat's Lightspeed constellation shows that, compared with different routing schemes, the proposed design reduces the average CPU usage by 73%, maintains a PDR above 91% during traffic bursts, and decreases urgent flow delay by 18 ms between Ottawa and Vancouver. The results confirm Flex-Algo's value as a slice-based traffic engineering (TE) tool for resource-constrained satellite networks.

Title: Adaptive Navigation Strategy for Low-Thrust Proximity Operations in Circular Relative Orbit
Authors: Dario Ruggiero, Mauro Mancini, Elisa Capello
Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive observer-based navigation strategy for spacecraft in Circular Relative Orbit (CRO) scenarios, addressing challenges in proximity operations like formation flight and uncooperative target inspection. The proposed method adjusts observer gains based on the estimated state to achieve fast convergence and low noise sensitivity in state estimation. A Lyapunov-based analysis ensures stability and accuracy, while simulations using vision-based sensor data validate the approach under realistic conditions. Compared to classical observers with time-invariant gains, the proposed method enhances trajectory tracking precision and reduces control input switching, making it a promising solution for autonomous spacecraft localization and control.

Title: Spectrogram Patch Codec: A 2D Block-Quantized VQ-VAE and HiFi-GAN for Neural Speech Coding
Authors: Luis Felipe Chary, Miguel Arjona Ramirez
Abstract: We present a neural speech codec that challenges the need for complex residual vector quantization (RVQ) stacks by introducing a simpler, single-stage quantization approach. Our method operates directly on the mel-spectrogram, treating it as a 2D data and quantizing non-overlapping 4x4 patches into a single, shared codebook. This patchwise design simplifies the architecture, enables low-latency streaming, and yields a discrete latent grid. To ensure high-fidelity synthesis, we employ a late-stage adversarial fine-tuning for the VQ-VAE and train a HiFi-GAN vocoder from scratch on the codec's reconstructed spectrograms. Operating at approximately 7.5 kbits/s for 16 kHz speech, our system was evaluated against several state-of-the-art neural codecs using objective metrics such as STOI, PESQ, MCD, and ViSQOL. The results demonstrate that our simplified, non-residual architecture achieves competitive perceptual quality and intelligibility, validating it as an effective and open foundation for future low-latency codec designs.

Title: Guidance and Control Neural Network Acceleration using Memristors
Authors: Zacharia A. Rudge, Dario Izzo, Moritz Fieback, Anteneh Gebregiorgis, Said Hamdioui, Dominik Dold
Abstract: In recent years, the space community has been exploring the possibilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), for a variety of on board applications. However, this development is limited by the restricted energy budget of smallsats and cubesats as well as radiation concerns plaguing modern chips. This necessitates research into neural network accelerators capable of meeting these requirements whilst satisfying the compute and performance needs of the application. This paper explores the use of Phase-Change Memory (PCM) and Resistive Random-Access Memory (RRAM) memristors for on-board in-memory computing AI acceleration in space applications. A guidance and control neural network (G\&CNET) accelerated using memristors is simulated in a variety of scenarios and with both device types to evaluate the performance of memristor-based accelerators, considering device non-idealities such as noise and conductance drift. We show that the memristive accelerator is able to learn the expert actions, though challenges remain with the impact of noise on accuracy. We also show that re-training after degradation is able to restore performance to nominal levels. This study provides a foundation for future research into memristor-based AI accelerators for space, highlighting their potential and the need for further investigation.

Title: TTA-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Text-to-Audio Models
Authors: Hui Wang, Cheng Liu, Junyang Chen, Haoze Liu, Yuhang Jia, Shiwan Zhao, Jiaming Zhou, Haoqin Sun, Hui Bu, Yong Qin
Abstract: Text-to-Audio (TTA) generation has made rapid progress, but current evaluation methods remain narrow, focusing mainly on perceptual quality while overlooking robustness, generalization, and ethical concerns. We present TTA-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating TTA models across functional performance, reliability, and social responsibility. It covers seven dimensions including accuracy, robustness, fairness, and toxicity, and includes 2,999 diverse prompts generated through automated and manual methods. We introduce a unified evaluation protocol that combines objective metrics with over 118,000 human annotations from both experts and general users. Ten state-of-the-art models are benchmarked under this framework, offering detailed insights into their strengths and limitations. TTA-Bench establishes a new standard for holistic and responsible evaluation of TTA systems. The dataset and evaluation tools are open-sourced at this https URL.

Title: Constrained Stabilization on the n-Sphere with Conic and Star-shaped Constraints
Authors: Mayur Sawant, Abdelhamid Tayebi
Abstract: The problem of constrained stabilization on the n-sphere under star-shaped constraints is considered. We propose a control strategy that allows to almost globally steer the state to a desired location while avoiding star-shaped constraints on the n-sphere. Depending on the state's proximity to the unsafe regions, the state is either guided towards the target location along the geodesic connecting the target to the state or steered towards the antipode of a predefined point lying in the interior of the nearest unsafe region. We prove that the target location is almost globally asymptotically stable under the proposed continuous, time-invariant feedback control law. Nontrivial simulation results on the 2-sphere and the 3-sphere demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

Title: Harnessing Information in Incentive Design
Authors: Raj Kiriti Velicheti, Subhonmesh Bose, Tamer Başar
Abstract: Incentive design deals with interaction between a principal and an agent where the former can shape the latter's utility through a policy commitment. It is well known that the principal faces an information rent when dealing with an agent that has informational advantage. In this work, we embark on a systematic study of the effect of information asymmetry in incentive design games. Specifically, we first demonstrate that it is in principal's interest to decrease this information asymmetry. To mitigate this uncertainty, we let the principal gather information either by letting the agent shape her belief (aka Information Design), or by paying to acquire it. Providing solutions to all these cases we show that while introduction of uncertainty increases the principal's cost, letting the agent shape its belief can be advantageous. We study information asymmetry and information acquisition in both matrix games and quadratic Gaussian game setups.

Title: Federated learning over physical channels: adaptive algorithms with near-optimal guarantees
Authors: Rui Zhang, Wenlong Mou
Abstract: In federated learning, communication cost can be significantly reduced by transmitting the information over the air through physical channels. In this paper, we propose a new class of adaptive federated stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms that can be implemented over physical channels, taking into account both channel noise and hardware constraints. We establish theoretical guarantees for the proposed algorithms, demonstrating convergence rates that are adaptive to the stochastic gradient noise level. We also demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our algorithms through simulation studies with deep learning models.

Title: Topology Inference for Network Systems with Unknown Inputs
Authors: Qing Jiao, Yushan Li, Jianping He
Abstract: Topology inference is a powerful tool to better understand the behaviours of network systems (NSs). Different from most of prior works, this paper is dedicated to inferring the directed topology of NSs from noisy observations, where the nodes are influenced by unknown time-varying inputs. These inputs can be actively injected signals by the user, intrinsic system noises or extrinsic environment interference. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose a two-stage inference scheme to overcome the influence of the inputs. First, by leveraging the second-order difference of the state evolution, we establish a judging criterion to detect the input injection time and provide the probability guarantees. With this injection time to determine available observations, an initial topology is accordingly inferred to further facilitate the input estimation. Second, utilizing the stability characteristic of the system response, a recursive input filtering algorithm is designed to approximate the zero-input response, which directly reflects the topology structure. Then, we construct a decreasing-weight based optimization problem to infer the final network topology from the approximated response. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: SyncNet: correlating objective for time delay estimation in audio signals
Authors: Akshay Raina, Vipul Arora
Abstract: This study addresses the task of performing robust and reliable time-delay estimation in signals in noisy and reverberating environments. In contrast to the popular signal processing based methods, this paper proposes to transform the input signals using a deep neural network into another pair of sequences which show high cross correlation at the actual time delay. This is achieved with the help of a novel correlation function based objective function for training the network. The proposed approach is also intrinsically interpretable as it does not lose temporal information. Experimental evaluations are performed for estimating mutual time delays for different types of audio signals such as pulse, speech and musical beats. SyncNet outperforms other classical approaches, such as GCC-PHAT, and some other learning based approaches.

Title: Sparse Representations of Dynamical Networks: A Coprime Factorization Approach
Authors: Şerban Sabău, Andrei Sperilă, Cristian Oară, Ali Jadbabaie
Abstract: We study a class of dynamical networks modeled by linear and time-invariant systems which are described by state-space realizations. For these networks, we investigate the relations between various types of factorizations which preserve the structure of their component subsystems' interconnection. In doing so, we provide tractable means of shifting between different types of sparsity-preserving representations and we show how to employ these factorizations to obtain distributed implementations for stabilizing and possibly stable controllers. By formulating all these results for both discrete- and continuous-time systems, we develop specialized distributed implementations that, up to this point, were only available for networks modeled as discrete-time systems.

Title: Adaptive control of dynamic networks
Authors: Chunyu Pan, Xizhe Zhang, Haoyu Zheng, Zhao Su, Changsheng Zhang, Weixiong Zhang
Abstract: Real-world network systems are inherently dynamic, with network topologies undergoing continuous changes over time. Previous works often focus on static networks or rely on complete prior knowledge of evolving topologies, whereas real-world networks typically undergo stochastic structural changes that are difficult to predict in advance. To address this challenge, we define the adaptive control problem and propose an adaptive control algorithm to reduce the extra control cost caused by driver node switching. We introduce a node-level adaptive control metric to capture both the stability and consistency of each node across historical topologies. By integrating this metric with a partial matching repair strategy, our algorithm adjusts the minimum driver node set in real time at each snapshot, while minimizing unnecessary reconfigurations between consecutive time steps. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world dynamic networks demonstrate that the proposed adaptive control algorithm significantly outperforms the existing algorithm, reducing the switching cost by an average of 22% in synthetic networks and 19\% in real-world networks, without requiring foreknowledge of the future evolution of the network. These findings extend the theoretical scope of dynamic network controllability and open new avenues for practical applications in transportation, social, and molecular regulatory systems.

Title: XVertNet: Unsupervised Contrast Enhancement of Vertebral Structures with Dynamic Self-Tuning Guidance and Multi-Stage Analysis
Authors: Ella Eidlin, Assaf Hoogi, Hila Rozen, Mohammad Badarne, Nathan S. Netanyahu
Abstract: Chest X-rays remain the primary diagnostic tool in emergency medicine, yet their limited ability to capture fine anatomical details can result in missed or delayed diagnoses. To address this, we introduce XVertNet, a novel deep-learning framework designed to enhance vertebral structure visualization in X-ray images significantly. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) An unsupervised learning architecture that eliminates reliance on manually labeled training data a persistent bottleneck in medical imaging, and (2) a dynamic self-tuned internal guidance mechanism featuring an adaptive feedback loop for real-time image optimization. Extensive validation across four major public datasets revealed that XVertNet outperforms state-of-the-art enhancement methods, as demonstrated by improvements in entropy scores, Tenengrad criterion values, the local phase coherence sharpness index (LPC-SI), and thetone mapped image quality index (TMQI). Furthermore, clinical validation conducted with two board-certified radiologists confirmed that the enhanced images enabled more sensitive detection of subtle vertebral fractures and degenerative changes. The unsupervised nature of XVertNet facilitates immediate clinical deployment without requiring additional training overhead. This innovation represents a transformative advancement in emergency radiology, providing a scalable and time-efficient solution to enhance diagnostic accuracy in high-pressure clinical environments.

Title: Learning disturbance models for offset-free reference tracking
Authors: Pablo Krupa, Mario Zanon, Alberto Bemporad
Abstract: This work presents a nonlinear control framework that guarantees asymptotic offset-free tracking of generic reference trajectories by learning a nonlinear disturbance model, which compensates for input disturbances and model-plant mismatch. Our approach generalizes the well-established method of using an observer to estimate a constant disturbance to allow tracking constant setpoints with zero steady-state error. In this paper, the disturbance model is generalized to a nonlinear static function of the plant's state and command input, learned online, so as to perfectly track time-varying reference trajectories under certain assumptions on the model and provided that future reference samples are available. We compare our approach with the classical constant disturbance model in numerical simulations, showing its superiority.

Title: Voice Conversion Augmentation for Speaker Recognition on Defective Datasets
Authors: Ruijie Tao, Zhan Shi, Yidi Jiang, Tianchi Liu, Haizhou Li
Abstract: Modern speaker recognition system relies on abundant and balanced datasets for classification training. However, diverse defective datasets, such as partially-labelled, small-scale, and imbalanced datasets, are common in real-world applications. Previous works usually studied specific solutions for each scenario from the algorithm perspective. However, the root cause of these problems lies in dataset imperfections. To address these challenges with a unified solution, we propose the Voice Conversion Augmentation (VCA) strategy to obtain pseudo speech from the training set. Furthermore, to guarantee generation quality, we designed the VCA-NN~(nearest neighbours) strategy to select source speech from utterances that are close to the target speech in the representation space. Our experimental results on three created datasets demonstrated that VCA-NN effectively mitigates these dataset problems, which provides a new direction for handling the speaker recognition problems from the data aspect.

Title: Nonparametric Control Koopman Operators
Authors: Petar Bevanda, Bas Driessen, Lucian Cristian Iacob, Stefan Sosnowski, Roland Tóth, Sandra Hirche
Abstract: This paper presents a novel Koopman composition operator representation framework for control systems in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) that is free of explicit dictionary or input parametrizations. By establishing fundamental equivalences between different model representations, we are able to close the gap of control system operator learning and infinite-dimensional regression, enabling various empirical estimators and the connection to the well-understood learning theory in RKHSs under one unified framework. Consequently, our proposed framework allows for arbitrarily accurate finite-rank approximations in infinite-dimensional spaces and leads to finite-dimensional predictors without apriori restrictions to a finite span of functions or inputs. To enable applications to high-dimensional control systems, we improve the scalability of our proposed control Koopman operator estimates by utilizing sketching techniques. Numerical experiments demonstrate superior prediction accuracy compared to bilinear EDMD, especially in high dimensions. Finally, we show that our learned models are readily interfaced with linear-parameter-varying techniques for model predictive control.

Title: RSMA Assisted ISAC With Hybrid Beamforming
Authors: Zhuohui Yao, Wenchi Cheng, Liping Liang, Tao Zhang, Jun Gong
Abstract: The harsh environment and scarce resources post-disaster drive the equipment to be miniaturized and portable. Based on this, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems play a significant role in providing emergency wireless networks. In order to reduce the hardware cost, a hybrid beamforming (HBF) assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) ISAC system, which exploits the limited number of radio frequency (RF) chains, is considered in this paper. However, the HBF structure reduces the spatial degrees of freedom, thus leading to increased interference among communication users and radar sensing. To solve this problem, a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) strategy is adopted to enhance the emergency mmWave-ISAC system. We formulate the weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization objective by jointly designing common rate allocation and HBF. Then, we propose the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) coupled with the weighted mean squared error (WMMSE) method to solve this high-dimensional non-convex problem. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show that the RSMA-ISAC scheme outperforms other benchmark schemes.

Title: Spatial Audio Signal Enhancement: A Multi-output MVDR Method in The Spherical Harmonic-domain
Authors: Huawei Zhang, Jihui Zhang, Huiyuan Sun, Prasanga Samarasinghe
Abstract: Spatial audio signal enhancement aims to reduce interfering source contributions while preserving the desired sound field with its spatial cues. Existing methods generally rely on impractical assumptions (e.g. accurate estimations of impractical information) or have limited applicability. This paper presents a spherical harmonic (SH)-domain minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR)-based spatial signal enhancer using Relative Harmonic Coefficients (ReHCs) to extract clean SH coefficients from noisy recordings in reverberant environments. A simulation study shows the proposed method achieves lower estimation error, higher speech-distortion-ratio (SDR), and comparable noise reduction (NR) within the sweet area in a reverberant environment, compared to a beamforming-and-projection method as the baseline.

Title: VSLLaVA: a pipeline of large multimodal foundation model for industrial vibration signal analysis
Authors: Qi Li, Xinran Zhang, Jinfeng Huang, Hongliang He, Feibin Zhang, Zhaoye Qin, Fulei Chu
Abstract: While Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in general multimodal tasks, they lack the domain-specific knowledge for industrial vibration signal analysis. This paper introduces VSLLaVA, a comprehensive pipeline that utilizes expert knowledge-guided instruction tuning and evaluation to create an end-to-end LMM for signal analysis. To achieve this, we construct a novel Signal-Question-Answer (SQA) dataset using an expert rule-based signal generator. This dataset facilitates a two-stage learning procedure. The first step is efficient instruction fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which imparts specialized signal identification capabilities. Subsequently, we designed a tailored Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine the reasoning capabilities and enhance classification robustness. Then, a dual-mode evaluation framework is proposed, combining an LLM referee with expert rules for semantic assessment using quantitative metrics for numerical and textual accuracy, which reveals that VSLLaVA significantly improves performance in signal type identification and parameter analysis, and makes progress in the identification and parameter analysis of fault-related signals. This research demonstrates a viable approach for developing specialized foundational models for complex industrial applications and marks a transition from conventional task-specific systems to a cohesive, interactive foundational model.

Title: Impact of Reflectors and MIMO on ML-Aided mmWave/sub-THz Blockage Prediction
Authors: Roghieh Mahdavihaji, Alexandra Duel-Hallen, Hans Hallen
Abstract: The performance of millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz) communication systems is significantly impaired by sensitivity to sudden blockages. In this work, we employ machine learning (ML) and our physics-based simulation tool to warn about the upcoming blockage tens of 5G frames ahead for highway speeds, providing a sufficient time for a proactive response. Performance of this ML-aided early-warning-of-blockage (ML-EW) algorithm is analyzed for realistic outdoor mobile environments with diverse reflectors and antenna arrays placed at the base station (BS) and user equipment (UE) over a range of mmWave and sub-THz frequencies. ML accuracy of about 90% or higher is demonstrated for highway UE, blocker, and reflector speeds, multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems, and frequencies in mmWave/sub-THz range.

Title: Time-constrained Federated Learning (FL) in Push-Pull IoT Wireless Access
Authors: Van Phuc Bui, Junya Shiraishi, Petar Popovski, Shashi Raj Pandey
Abstract: Training a high-quality Federated Learning (FL) model at the network edge is challenged by limited transmission resources. Although various device scheduling strategies have been proposed, it remains unclear how scheduling decisions affect the FL model performance under temporal constraints. This is pronounced when the wireless medium is shared to enable the participation of heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) devices with distinct communication modes: (1) a scheduling (pull) scheme, that selects devices with valuable updates, and (2) random access (push), in which interested devices transmit model parameters. This work investigates the interplay of push-pull interactions in a time-constrained FL setting, where the communication opportunities are finite, with a utility-based analytical model. Using real-world datasets, we provide a performance tradeoff analysis that validates the significance of strategic device scheduling under push-pull wireless access for several practical settings. The simulation results elucidate the impact of the device sampling strategy on learning efficiency under timing constraints.

Title: Coexistence of Radar and Communication with Rate-Splitting Wireless Access
Authors: Anup Mishra, Israel Leyva-Mayorga, Petar Popovski
Abstract: Future wireless networks are envisioned to facilitate the seamless coexistence of communication and sensing functionalities, thereby enabling the much-touted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) paradigm. A key challenge in ISAC is managing inter-functionality interference while maintaining a balanced performance trade-off. In this work, we propose a rate-splitting (RS)-inspired approach to address this challenge in an uplink ISAC scenario, where a base station (BS) serves an uplink communication user while detecting a radar target. We derive inner bounds on the ergodic data information rate for the communication user and the ergodic radar estimation information rate for the sensing target. A closed-form solution is also derived for the optimal power split in RS that maximizes the communication user's performance. Compared to orthogonal multiple access (OMA)- and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-inspired approaches, the proposed approach achieves a more favorable sensing-communication trade-off by virtue of the decoding order flexibility introduced through splitting the communication message. Notably, this is the first work to employ an RS-inspired strategy as a general framework for non-orthogonal coexistence of sensing and communication, extending its applicability beyond traditional digital-only settings.

Title: Offset-free model predictive control: stability under plant-model mismatch
Authors: Steven J. Kuntz, James B. Rawlings
Abstract: We present the first general stability results for nonlinear offset-free model predictive control (MPC). Despite over twenty years of active research, the offset-free MPC literature has not shaken the assumption of closed-loop stability for establishing offset-free performance. In this paper, we present a nonlinear offset-free MPC design that is robustly stable with respect to the tracking errors, and thus achieves offset-free performance, despite plant-model mismatch and persistent disturbances. Key features and assumptions of this design include quadratic costs, differentiability of the plant and model functions, constraint backoffs at steady state, and a robustly stable state and disturbance estimator. We first establish nominal stability and offset-free performance. Then, robustness to state and disturbance estimate errors and setpoint and disturbance changes is demonstrated. Finally, the results are extended to sufficiently small plant-model mismatch. The results are illustrated by numerical examples.

Title: Acceleration and Parallelization Methods for ISRS EGN Model
Authors: Ruiyang Xia, Guanjun Gao, Zanshan Zhao, Haoyu Wang, Kun Wen, Daobin Wang
Abstract: The enhanced Gaussian noise (EGN) model, which accounts for inter-channel stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS), has been extensively utilized for evaluating nonlinear interference (NLI) within the C+L band. Compared to closed-form expressions and machine learning-based NLI evaluation models, it demonstrates broader applicability and its accuracy is not dependent on the support of large-scale datasets. However, its high computational complexity often results in lengthy computation times. Through analysis, the high-frequency oscillations of the four-wave mixing (FWM) efficiency factor integrand were identified as a primary factor limiting the computational speed of the ISRS EGN model. To address this issue, we propose an approximation method to derive a closed-form expression for the FWM efficiency factor, which provides both high accuracy and high computational efficiency. Numerical results demonstrate that the method proposed in this work could achieve low error levels under high ISRS influence levels, with an absolute mean error (MAE) of approximately 0.0033 dB. Furthermore, a parallel computation strategy targeting independent regions within the integration domain is proposed and optimized, which further significantly improves computing efficiency.

Title: Fixed-Time Input-to-State Stability for Singularly Perturbed Systems via Composite Lyapunov Functions
Authors: Michael Tang, Miroslav Krstic, Jorge Poveda
Abstract: We study singularly perturbed systems that exhibit input-to-state stability (ISS) with fixed-time properties in the presence of bounded disturbances. In these systems, solutions converge to the origin within a time frame independent of initial conditions when undisturbed, and to a vicinity of the origin when subjected to bounded disturbances. First, we extend the traditional composite Lyapunov method, commonly applied in singular perturbation theory to analyze asymptotic stability, to include fixed-time ISS. We demonstrate that if both the reduced system and the boundary layer system exhibit fixed-time ISS, and if certain interconnection conditions are met, the entire multi-time scale system retains this fixed-time ISS characteristic, provided the separation of time scales is sufficiently pronounced. Next, we illustrate our findings via analytical and numerical examples, including a novel application in fixed-time feedback optimization for dynamic plants with slowly varying cost functions.

Title: A Review of Hydrogen-Enabled Resilience Enhancement for Multi-Energy Systems
Authors: Liang Yu, Haoyu Fang, Goran Strbac, Dawei Qiu, Dong Yue, Xiaohong Guan, Gerhard P. Hancke
Abstract: Ensuring resilience in multi-energy systems (MESs) becomes both more urgent and more challenging due to the rising occurrence and severity of extreme events (e.g., natural disasters, extreme weather, and cyber-physical attacks). Among many measures of strengthening MES resilience, the integration of hydrogen shows exceptional potential in cross-temporal flexibility, cross-spatial flexibility, cross-sector flexibility, and black start capability. Although many hydrogen-enabled MES resilience enhancement measures have been developed, the current literature lacks a systematic overview of hydrogen-enabled resilience enhancement in MESs. To fill the research gap, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of hydrogen-enabled MES resilience enhancement. First, advantages and challenges of adopting hydrogen in MES resilience enhancement are summarized. Then, we propose a resilience enhancement framework for hydrogen-enabled MESs. Under the proposed framework, existing resilience metrics and event-oriented contingency models are summarized and discussed. Furthermore, we classify hydrogen-enabled planning measures by the types of hydrogen-related facilities and provide some insights for planning problem formulation frameworks. Moreover, we categorize the hydrogen-enabled operation enhancement measures into three operation response stages: preventive, emergency, and restoration. Finally, we identify some research gaps and point out possible future directions in aspects of comprehensive resilience metric design, temporally-correlated event-targeted scenario generation, multi-type temporal-spatial cyber-physical contingency modeling under compound extreme events, multi-network multi-timescale coordinated planning and operation, low-carbon resilient planning and operation, and large language model-assisted whole-process resilience enhancement.

Title: Modulo Sampling: Performance Guarantees in The Presence of Quantization
Authors: Neil Irwin Bernardo, Shaik Basheeruddin Shah, Yonina C. Eldar
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the dynamic range and quantization noise power in modulo analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Two modulo ADC systems are considered: (1) a modulo ADC which outputs the folded samples and an additional 1-bit folding information signal, and (2) a modulo ADC without the 1-bit information. A recovery algorithm that unfolds the quantized modulo samples using the extra 1-bit folding information is analyzed. Using the dithered quantization framework, we show that an oversampling factor of $\mathrm{OF} > 3$ and a quantizer resolution of $b > 3$ are sufficient conditions to unfold the modulo samples. When these conditions are met, we demonstrate that the mean squared error (MSE) performance of modulo ADC with an extra 1-bit folding information signal is better than that of a conventional ADC with the same number of bits used for amplitude quantization. Since folding information is typically not available in modulo ADCs, we also propose and analyze a recovery algorithm based on orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) that does not require the 1-bit folding information. In this case, we prove that $\mathrm{OF} > 3$ and $b > 3 + \log_2(\delta)$ for some $\delta > 1$ are sufficient conditions to unfold the modulo samples. For the two systems considered, we show that, with sufficient number of bits for amplitude quantization, the mean squared error (MSE) of a modulo ADC is $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\mathrm{OF}^3}\right)$ whereas that of a conventional ADC is only $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\mathrm{OF}}\right)$. We extend the analysis to the case of simultaneous acquisition of weak and strong signals occupying different frequency bands. Finally, numerical results are presented to validate the derived performance guarantees.

Title: Best Response Convergence for Zero-sum Stochastic Dynamic Games with Partial and Asymmetric Information
Authors: Yuxiang Guan, Iman Shames, Tyler H. Summers
Abstract: We analyze best response dynamics for finding a Nash equilibrium of an infinite horizon zero-sum stochastic linear quadratic dynamic game (LQDG) with partial and asymmetric information. We derive explicit expressions for each player's best response within the class of pure linear dynamic output feedback control strategies where the internal state dimension of each control strategy is an integer multiple of the system state dimension. With each best response, the players form increasingly higher-order belief states, leading to infinite-dimensional internal states. However, we observe in extensive numerical experiments that the game's value converges after just a few iterations, suggesting that strategies associated with increasingly higher-order belief states eventually provide no benefit. To help explain this convergence, our numerical analysis reveals rapid decay of the controllability and observability Gramian eigenvalues and Hankel singular values in higher-order belief dynamics, indicating that the higher-order belief dynamics become increasingly difficult for both players to control and observe. Consequently, the higher-order belief dynamics can be closely approximated by low-order belief dynamics with bounded error, and thus feedback strategies with limited internal state dimension can closely approximate a Nash equilibrium.

Title: Universal Vessel Segmentation for Multi-Modality Retinal Images
Authors: Bo Wen, Anna Heinke, Akshay Agnihotri, Dirk-Uwe Bartsch, William Freeman, Truong Nguyen, Cheolhong An
Abstract: We identify two major limitations in the existing studies on retinal vessel segmentation: (1) Most existing works are restricted to one modality, i.e, the Color Fundus (CF). However, multi-modality retinal images are used every day in the study of retina and diagnosis of retinal diseases, and the study of vessel segmentation on the other modalities is scarce; (2) Even though a few works extended their experiments to limited new modalities such as the Multi-Color Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (MC), these works still require finetuning a separate model for the new modality. The finetuning will require extra training data, which is difficult to acquire. In this work, we present a novel universal vessel segmentation model (UVSM) for multi-modality retinal images. Not only do we perform the study on a much wider range of modalities, but we also propose a universal model to segment the vessels in all these commonly-used modalities. Despite being much more versatile comparing with existing methods, our universal model still demonstrates comparable performance with the state-of-the-art finetuned methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that achieves modality-agnostic retinal vessel segmentation and also the first work that studies retinal vessel segmentation in some novel modalities.

Title: Port-LLM: A Port Prediction Method for Fluid Antenna based on Large Language Models
Authors: Yali Zhang, Haifan Yin, Weidong Li, Emil Bjornson, Merouane Debbah
Abstract: The objective of this study is to address the mobility challenges faced by user equipment (UE) through the implementation of fluid antenna (FA) on the UE side. This approach aims to maintain the time-varying channel in a relatively stable state by strategically relocating the FA to an appropriate port. To the best of our knowledge, this paper introduces, for the first time, the application of large language models (LLMs) in the prediction of FA ports, presenting a novel model termed Port-LLM. Our proposed method for predicting the moving port of the FA is a two-step prediction method. To enhance the learning efficacy of our proposed Port-LLM model, we integrate low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning technology. Additionally, to further exploit the natural language processing capabilities of pre-trained LLMs, we propose a framework named Prompt-Port-LLM, which is constructed upon the Port-LLM architecture and incorporates prompt fine-tuning techniques along with a specialized prompt encoder module. The simulation results show that our proposed models all exhibit strong generalization ability and robustness under different numbers of base station antennas and medium-to-high mobility speeds of UE. In comparison to existing methods, the performance of the port predicted by our models demonstrates superior efficacy. Moreover, both of our proposed models achieve millimeter-level inference speed.

Title: NeuroAMP: A Novel End-to-end General Purpose Deep Neural Amplifier for Personalized Hearing Aids
Authors: Shafique Ahmed, Ryandhimas E. Zezario, Hui-Guan Yuan, Amir Hussain, Hsin-Min Wang, Wei-Ho Chung, Yu Tsao
Abstract: The prevalence of hearing aids is increasing. However, optimizing the amplification processes of hearing aids remains challenging due to the complexity of integrating multiple modular components in traditional methods. To address this challenge, we present NeuroAMP, a novel deep neural network designed for end-to-end, personalized amplification in hearing aids. NeuroAMP leverages both spectral features and the listener's audiogram as inputs, and we investigate four architectures: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN), and Transformer. We also introduce Denoising NeuroAMP, an extension that integrates noise reduction along with amplification capabilities for improved performance in real-world scenarios. To enhance generalization, a comprehensive data augmentation strategy was employed during training on diverse speech (TIMIT and TMHINT) and music (Cadenza Challenge MUSIC) datasets. Evaluation using the Hearing Aid Speech Perception Index (HASPI), Hearing Aid Speech Quality Index (HASQI), and Hearing Aid Audio Quality Index (HAAQI) demonstrates that the Transformer architecture within NeuroAMP achieves the best performance, with SRCC scores of 0.9927 (HASQI) and 0.9905 (HASPI) on TIMIT, and 0.9738 (HAAQI) on the Cadenza Challenge MUSIC dataset. Notably, our data augmentation strategy maintains high performance on unseen datasets (e.g., VCTK, MUSDB18-HQ). Furthermore, Denoising NeuroAMP outperforms both the conventional NAL-R+WDRC approach and a two-stage baseline on the VoiceBank+DEMAND dataset, achieving a 10% improvement in both HASPI (0.90) and HASQI (0.59) scores. These results highlight the potential of NeuroAMP and Denoising NeuroAMP to deliver notable improvements in personalized hearing aid amplification.

Title: Bridging Synthetic-to-Real Gaps: Frequency-Aware Perturbation and Selection for Single-shot Multi-Parametric Mapping Reconstruction
Authors: Linyu Fan, Che Wang, Ming Ye, Qizhi Yang, Zejun Wu, Xinghao Ding, Yue Huang, Jianfeng Bao, Shuhui Cai, Congbo Cai
Abstract: Data-centric artificial intelligence (AI) has remarkably advanced medical imaging, with emerging methods using synthetic data to address data scarcity while introducing synthetic-to-real gaps. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) shows promise in ground truth-scarce tasks, but its application in reconstruction remains underexplored. Although multiple overlapping-echo detachment (MOLED) achieves ultra-fast multi-parametric reconstruction, extending its application to various clinical scenarios, the quality suffers from deficiency in mitigating the domain gap, difficulty in maintaining structural integrity, and inadequacy in ensuring mapping accuracy. To resolve these issues, we proposed frequency-aware perturbation and selection (FPS), comprising Wasserstein distance-modulated frequency-aware perturbation (WDFP) and hierarchical frequency-aware selection network (HFSNet), which integrates frequency-aware adaptive selection (FAS), compact FAS (cFAS) and feature-aware architecture integration (FAI). Specifically, perturbation activates domain-invariant feature learning within uncertainty, while selection refines optimal solutions within perturbation, establishing a robust and closed-loop learning pathway. Extensive experiments on synthetic data, along with diverse real clinical cases from 5 healthy volunteers, 94 ischemic stroke patients, and 46 meningioma patients, demonstrate the superiority and clinical applicability of FPS. Furthermore, FPS is applied to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), underscoring its versatility and potential for broader medical applications. The code is available at this https URL.

Title: DeepNuParc: A Novel Deep Clustering Framework for Fine-scale Parcellation of Brain Nuclei Using Diffusion MRI Tractography
Authors: Haolin He, Ce Zhu, Le Zhang, Yipeng Liu, Xiao Xu, Yuqian Chen, Leo Zekelman, Jarrett Rushmore, Yogesh Rathi, Nikos Makris, Lauren J. O'Donnell, Fan Zhang
Abstract: Brain nuclei are clusters of anatomically distinct neurons that serve as important hubs for processing and relaying information in various neural circuits. Fine-scale parcellation of the brain nuclei is vital for a comprehensive understanding of its anatomico-functional correlations. Diffusion MRI tractography is an advanced imaging technique that can estimate the brain's white matter structural connectivity to potentially reveal the topography of the nuclei of interest for studying its subdivisions. In this work, we present a deep clustering pipeline, namely DeepNuParc, to perform automated, fine-scale parcellation of brain nuclei using diffusion MRI tractography. First, we incorporate a newly proposed deep learning approach to enable accurate segmentation of the nuclei of interest directly on the dMRI data. Next, we design a novel streamline clustering-based structural connectivity feature for a robust representation of voxels within the nuclei. Finally, we improve the popular joint dimensionality reduction and k-means clustering approach to enable nuclei parcellation at a finer scale. We demonstrate DeepNuParc on two important brain structures, i.e. the amygdala and the thalamus, that are known to have multiple anatomically and functionally distinct nuclei subdivisions. Experimental results show that DeepNuParc enables consistent parcellation of the nuclei into multiple parcels across multiple subjects and achieves good correspondence with the widely used coarse-scale atlases.

Title: Goal-Oriented Remote Tracking Through Correlated Observations in Pull-based Communications
Authors: Abolfazl Zakeri, Mohammad Moltafet, Marian Codreanu
Abstract: We address the real-time remote tracking problem in a status update system comprising two sensors, two independent information sources, and a remote monitor. The status updating follows a pull-based communication, where the monitor commands/pulls the sensors for status updates, i.e., the actual state of the sources. We consider that the observations are \textit{correlated}, meaning that each sensor's sent data could also include the state of the other source due to, e.g., inter-sensor communications or overlapping monitoring regions. The effectiveness of data communication is measured by a generic distortion, capturing the underlying application goal. We provide optimal command/pulling policies for the monitor that minimize the average weighted sum distortion and transmission cost. Since the monitor cannot fully observe the exact state of each source, we propose a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and reformulate it as a belief MDP problem. We then effectively truncate the infinite belief space and transform it into a finite-state MDP problem, which is solved via relative value iteration. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the derived policy over age-based and deep-Q network baseline policies.

Title: SALT: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning via Singular Value Adaptation with Low-Rank Transformation
Authors: Abdelrahman Elsayed, Sarim Hashmi, Mohammed Elseiagy, Hu Wang, Mohammad Yaqub, Ibrahim Almakky
Abstract: The complex nature of medical image segmentation calls for models that are specifically designed to capture detailed, domain-specific features. Large foundation models offer considerable flexibility, yet the cost of fine-tuning these models remains a significant barrier. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), efficiently update model weights with low-rank matrices but may suffer from underfitting when the chosen rank is insufficient to capture domain-specific nuances. Conversely, full-rank Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based methods provide comprehensive updates by modifying all singular values, yet they often lack flexibility and exhibit variable performance across datasets. We propose SALT (Singular Value Adaptation with Low-Rank Transformation), a method that selectively adapts the most influential singular values using trainable scale and shift parameters while complementing this with a low-rank update for the remaining subspace. This hybrid approach harnesses the advantages of both LoRA and SVD, enabling effective adaptation without relying on increasing model size or depth. Evaluated on 5 challenging medical datasets, ranging from as few as 20 samples to 1000, SALT outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT (LoRA and SVD) by 2% to 5% in Dice with only 3.9% trainable parameters, demonstrating robust adaptation even in low-resource settings.

Title: Optimizing Breast Cancer Detection in Mammograms: A Comprehensive Study of Transfer Learning, Resolution Reduction, and Multi-View Classification
Authors: Daniel G. P. Petrini, Hae Yong Kim
Abstract: Mammography, an X-ray-based imaging technique, plays a crucial role in the early detection of breast cancer. Its accuracy heavily depends on expert radiologists, making it essential to minimize interpretation errors. To support radiologists, various computer-aided detection and diagnostic methods have been proposed, increasingly leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Over recent years, mammogram analysis has evolved significantly - from early patch-based classifiers, which examine only localized regions of images, to full-image classifiers, and later towards multi-view systems that simultaneously integrate multiple perspectives of the mammographic exam for enhanced accuracy. Despite this progression, critical questions remain, such as whether multi-view systems consistently outperform single-view approaches. In this paper, we systematically evaluate and compare the effectiveness of single-view and multi-view mammogram classification techniques. Our research introduces models that achieve superior performance relative to existing state-of-the-art approaches in both single-view and two-view classification scenarios. Furthermore, our findings provide valuable insights into optimal model architectures and effective transfer learning strategies, paving the way for more accurate and efficient mammogram interpretation.

Abstract: This work deals with the generation of theoretical correlation matrices with specific sparsity patterns, associated to graph structures. We present a novel approach based on convex optimization, offering greater flexibility compared to existing techniques, notably by controlling the mean of the entry distribution in the generated correlation matrices. This allows for the generation of correlation matrices that better represent realistic data and can be used to benchmark statistical methods for graph inference.

Title: Towards Interpretable Counterfactual Generation via Multimodal Autoregression
Authors: Chenglong Ma, Yuanfeng Ji, Jin Ye, Lu Zhang, Ying Chen, Tianbin Li, Mingjie Li, Junjun He, Hongming Shan
Abstract: Counterfactual medical image generation enables clinicians to explore clinical hypotheses, such as predicting disease progression, facilitating their decision-making. While existing methods can generate visually plausible images from disease progression prompts, they produce silent predictions that lack interpretation to verify how the generation reflects the hypothesized progression -- a critical gap for medical applications that require traceable reasoning. In this paper, we propose Interpretable Counterfactual Generation (ICG), a novel task requiring the joint generation of counterfactual images that reflect the clinical hypothesis and interpretation texts that outline the visual changes induced by the hypothesis. To enable ICG, we present ICG-CXR, the first dataset pairing longitudinal medical images with hypothetical progression prompts and textual interpretations. We further introduce ProgEmu, an autoregressive model that unifies the generation of counterfactual images and textual interpretations. We demonstrate the superiority of ProgEmu in generating progression-aligned counterfactuals and interpretations, showing significant potential in enhancing clinical decision support and medical education.

Title: Energy-Aware Lane Planning for Connected Electric Vehicles in Urban Traffic: Design and Vehicle-in-the-Loop Validation
Authors: Hansung Kim, Eric Yongkeun Choi, Eunhyek Joa, Hotae Lee, Linda Lim, Scott Moura, Francesco Borrelli
Abstract: Urban driving with connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) offers potential for energy savings, yet most eco-driving strategies focus solely on longitudinal speed control within a single lane. This neglects the significant impact of lateral decisions, such as lane changes, on overall energy efficiency, especially in environments with traffic signals and heterogeneous traffic flow. To address this gap, we propose a novel energy-aware motion planning framework that jointly optimizes longitudinal speed and lateral lane-change decisions using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. Our approach estimates long-term energy costs using a graph-based approximation and solves short-horizon optimal control problems under traffic constraints. Using a data-driven energy model calibrated to an actual battery electric vehicle, we demonstrate with vehicle-in-the-loop experiments that our method reduces motion energy consumption by up to 24 percent compared to a human driver, highlighting the potential of connectivity-enabled planning for sustainable urban autonomy.

Title: Directional excitability in Hilbert spaces
Authors: Gustave Bainier, Alessio Franci
Abstract: We introduce a generalized excitable system in which spikes can happen in a continuum of directions, therefore drastically enriching the expressivity and control capability of the spiking dynamics. In this generalized excitable system, spiking trajectories happen in a Hilbert space with an excitable resting state at the origin and spike responses that can be triggered in any direction as a function of the system's state and inputs. State-dependence of the spiking direction provide the system with a vanishing spiking memory trace, which enables robust tracking and integration of inputs in the spiking direction history. The model exhibits generalized forms of both Hodgkin's Type I and Type II excitability, capturing their usual bifurcation behaviors in an abstract setting. When used as the controller of a two-dimensional navigation task, this model facilitates both the sparseness of the actuation and its sensitivity to environmental inputs. These results highlight the potential of the proposed generalized excitable model for excitable control in high- and infinite-dimensional spaces.

Title: Beyond Asymptotics: Targeted exploration with finite-sample guarantees
Authors: Janani Venkatasubramanian, Johannes Köhler, Frank Allgöwer
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a targeted exploration strategy for the non-asymptotic, finite-time case. The proposed strategy is applicable to uncertain linear time-invariant systems subject to sub-Gaussian disturbances. As the main result, the proposed approach provides a priori guarantees, ensuring that the optimized exploration inputs achieve a desired accuracy of the model parameters. The technical derivation of the strategy (i) leverages existing non-asymptotic identification bounds with self-normalized martingales, (ii) utilizes spectral lines to predict the effect of sinusoidal excitation, and (iii) effectively accounts for spectral transient error and parametric uncertainty. A numerical example illustrates how the finite exploration time influence the required exploration energy.

Title: Robust MPC for Uncertain Linear Systems - Combining Model Adaptation and Iterative Learning
Authors: Hannes Petrenz, Johannes Köhler, Francesco Borrelli
Abstract: This paper presents a robust adaptive learning Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for linear systems with parametric uncertainties and additive disturbances performing iterative tasks. The approach refines the parameter estimates online using set-membership estimation. Performance enhancement over iterations is achieved by learning the terminal cost from data. Safety is enforced using a terminal set, which is also learned iteratively. The proposed method guarantees recursive feasibility, constraint satisfaction, and a robust bound on the closed-loop cost. Numerical simulations on a mass-spring-damper system demonstrate improved computational efficiency and control performance compared to a robust adaptive MPC scheme without iterative learning of the terminal ingredients.

Title: Introducing Combined Effects of Filtering and ASE Noise in Optical Links Supposing Different Equalization Algorithms
Authors: Enrico Miotto, Andrea Rosso, Emanuele Virgillito, Stefano Straullu, Andrea Castoldi, Andrea Bovio, Francisco Martinez Rodriguez, Vittorio Curri
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analytical framework for evaluating filtering penalties in ASE-noise-limited coherent optical links. The model accounts for the cumulative effects of cascaded optical filters, amplifier-induced ASE noise, and transceiver noise, alongside digital equalization at the receiver. By developing a generalized channel representation, we derive closed-form expressions for signal-to-noise ratio degradation under various equalization strategies, including Zero-Forcing Equalizer, Minimum Mean Square Error Equalizer, and Fractionally Spaced Equalizer. These models capture the impact of colored noise resulting from linear filtering and provide both time and frequency-domain insights. The proposed framework is validated through experimental comparisons using accurately modeled optical filters, demonstrating close agreement between theory and practice and offering a robust foundation for system-level performance evaluation in metro-access networks.

Title: Simultaneously Exposing and Jamming Covert Communications via Disco Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces
Authors: Huan Huang, Hongliang Zhang, Yi Cai, Dusit Niyato, A. Lee Swindlehurst, Zhu Han
Abstract: Covert communications provide a stronger privacy protection than cryptography and physical-layer security (PLS). However, previous works on covert communications have implicitly assumed the validity of channel reciprocity, i.e., wireless channels remain constant or approximately constant during their coherence time. In this work, we investigate covert communications in the presence of a disco RIS (DRIS) deployed by the warden Willie, where the DRIS with random and time-varying reflective coefficients acts as a "disco ball", introducing timevarying fully-passive jamming (FPJ). Consequently, the channel reciprocity assumption no longer holds. The DRIS not only jams the covert transmissions between Alice and Bob, but also decreases the error probabilities of Willie's detections, without either Bob's channel knowledge or additional jamming power. To quantify the impact of the DRIS on covert communications, we first design a detection rule for the warden Willie in the presence of time-varying FPJ introduced by the DRIS. Then, we define the detection error probabilities, i.e., the false alarm rate (FAR) and the missed detection rate (MDR), as the monitoring performance metrics for Willie's detections, and the signal-to-jamming-plusnoise ratio (SJNR) as a communication performance metric for the covert transmissions between Alice and Bob. Based on the detection rule, we derive the detection threshold for the warden Willie to detect whether communications between Alice and Bob is ongoing, considering the time-varying DRIS-based FPJ. Moreover, we conduct theoretical analyses of the FAR and the MDR at the warden Willie, as well as SJNR at Bob, and then present unique properties of the DRIS-based FPJ in covert communications. We present numerical results to validate the derived theoretical analyses and evaluate the impact of DRIS on covert communications.

Title: FreqSelect: Frequency-Aware fMRI-to-Image Reconstruction
Authors: Junliang Ye, Lei Wang, Md Zakir Hossain
Abstract: Reconstructing natural images from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data remains a core challenge in natural decoding due to the mismatch between the richness of visual stimuli and the noisy, low resolution nature of fMRI signals. While recent two-stage models, combining deep variational autoencoders (VAEs) with diffusion models, have advanced this task, they treat all spatial-frequency components of the input equally. This uniform treatment forces the model to extract meaning features and suppress irrelevant noise simultaneously, limiting its effectiveness. We introduce FreqSelect, a lightweight, adaptive module that selectively filters spatial-frequency bands before encoding. By dynamically emphasizing frequencies that are most predictive of brain activity and suppressing those that are uninformative, FreqSelect acts as a content-aware gate between image features and natural data. It integrates seamlessly into standard very deep VAE-diffusion pipelines and requires no additional supervision. Evaluated on the Natural Scenes dataset, FreqSelect consistently improves reconstruction quality across both low- and high-level metrics. Beyond performance gains, the learned frequency-selection patterns offer interpretable insights into how different visual frequencies are represented in the brain. Our method generalizes across subjects and scenes, and holds promise for extension to other neuroimaging modalities, offering a principled approach to enhancing both decoding accuracy and neuroscientific interpretability.

Title: Sampled-data Systems: Stability, Contractivity and Single-iteration Suboptimal MPC
Authors: Yiting Chen, Francesco Bullo, Emiliano Dall'Anese
Abstract: This paper analyzes the stability of interconnected continuous-time (CT) and discrete-time (DT) systems coupled through sampling and zero-order hold mechanisms. The DT system updates its output at regular intervals $T>0$ by applying an $n$-fold composition of a given map. This setup is motivated by online and sampled-data implementations of optimization-based controllers - particularly model predictive control (MPC) - where the DT system models $n$ iterations of an algorithm approximating the solution of an optimization problem. We introduce the concept of a reduced model, defined as the limiting behavior of the sampled-data system as $T \to 0^+$ and $n \to +\infty$. Our main theoretical contribution establishes that when the reduced model is contractive, there exists a threshold duration $T(n)$ for each iteration count $n$ such that the CT-DT interconnection achieves exponential stability for all sampling periods $T < T(n)$. Finally, under the stronger condition that both the CT and DT systems are contractive, we show exponential stability of their interconnection using a small-gain argument. Our theoretical results provide new insights into suboptimal MPC stability, showing that convergence guarantees hold even when using a single iteration of the optimization algorithm - a practically significant finding for real-time control applications.

Title: Current trends and future directions in event-based control
Authors: Michael Hertneck, David Meister, Frank Allgöwer
Abstract: The defining characteristic of event-based control is that feedback loops are only closed when indicated by a triggering condition that takes recent information about the system into account. This stands in contrast to periodic control where the feedback loop is closed periodically. Benefits of event-based control arise when sampling comes at a cost, which occurs, e.g., for Networked Control Systems or in other setups with resource constraints. A rapidly growing number of publications deals with event-based control. Nevertheless, some fundamental questions about event-based control are still unsolved. In this article, we provide an overview of current research trends in event-based control. We focus on results that aim for a better understanding of effects that occur in feedback loops with event-based control. Based on this summary, we identify important open directions for future research.

Title: A versatile foundation model for cine cardiac magnetic resonance image analysis tasks
Authors: Yunguan Fu, Wenjia Bai, Weixi Yi, Charlotte Manisty, Anish N Bhuva, Thomas A Treibel, James C Moon, Matthew J Clarkson, Rhodri Huw Davies, Yipeng Hu
Abstract: Here we present a versatile foundation model that can perform a range of clinically-relevant image analysis tasks, including segmentation, landmark localisation, diagnosis, and prognostication. A multi-view convolution-transformer masked autoencoder, named as CineMA, was trained on 15 million cine images from 74,916 subjects. The model was validated on multiple image analysis tasks and compared to existing models on >4,500 images from eight independent datasets with diverse population characteristics, representing the largest benchmark study for cine CMR so far. CineMA consistently outperformed conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in delineating ventricular boundaries and estimating ejection fraction, a key measure of cardiac function. The improved performance was preserved, even when the model only used half of fine-tuning data. CineMA also surpassed CNNs in disease detection and matched their performance in long-axis function measurement. Interestingly, we found that CineMA can also detect cardiac changes in systemic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension and cancer, and can also predict mortality. Finally, we assessed model fairness and demonstrated consistent model performance across demographic subgroups. These findings highlight CineMA's accuracy, learning efficiency, adaptability, and fairness, underscoring its potential as a foundation model for automated cardiac image analysis to support clinical workflow and cardiovascular research. All training and inference code and models are made publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Speaker Targeting via Self-Speaker Adaptation for Multi-talker ASR
Authors: Weiqing Wang, Taejin Park, Ivan Medennikov, Jinhan Wang, Kunal Dhawan, He Huang, Nithin Rao Koluguri, Jagadeesh Balam, Boris Ginsburg
Abstract: We propose a self-speaker adaptation method for streaming multi-talker automatic speech recognition (ASR) that eliminates the need for explicit speaker queries. Unlike conventional approaches requiring target speaker embeddings or enrollment audio, our technique dynamically adapts individual ASR instances through speaker-wise speech activity prediction. The key innovation involves injecting speaker-specific kernels generated via speaker supervision activations into selected ASR encoder layers. This enables instantaneous speaker adaptation to target speakers while handling fully overlapped speech even in a streaming scenario. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance in both offline and streaming scenarios, demonstrating that our self-adaptive method effectively addresses severe speech overlap through streamlined speaker-focused recognition. The results validate the proposed self-speaker adaptation approach as a robust solution for multi-talker ASR under severe overlapping speech conditions.

Title: Localized kernel method for separation of linear chirps
Authors: Eric Mason, Sippanon Kitimoon, Hrushikesh Mhaskar
Abstract: The task of separating a superposition of signals into its individual components is a common challenge encountered in various signal processing applications, especially in domains such as audio and radar signals. A previous paper by Chui and Mhaskar proposes a method called Signal Separation Operator (SSO) to find the instantaneous frequencies and amplitudes of such superpositions where both of these change continuously and slowly over time. In this paper, we amplify and modify this method in order to separate chirp signals in the presence of crossovers, a very low SNR, and discontinuities. We give a theoretical analysis of the behavior of SSO in the presence of noise to examine the relationship between the minimal separation, minimal amplitude, SNR, and sampling frequency. Our method is illustrated with a few examples, and numerical results are reported on a simulated dataset comprising 7 simulated signals.

Title: MMOC: Self-Supervised EEG Emotion Recognition Framework with Multi-Model Online Collaboration
Authors: Hanqi Wang, Yang Liu, Peng Ye, Liang Song
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) emotion recognition plays a crucial role in human-computer interaction, particularly in healthcare and neuroscience. While supervised learning has been widely used, its reliance on manual annotations introduces high costs and potential bias. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising alternative by generating labels through pretext tasks. However, high inter-subject variability in EEG signals leads to significant data drift, limiting self-supervised models' generalization across unseen subjects. Traditional domain adaptation (DA) methods require access to target-domain data during training. Although domain generalization (DG) avoids this constraint, it often falls short in handling complex data drift due to limited coverage of possible target distributions. To tackle these challenges, we propose MMOC, a self-supervised framework with multi-model online collaboration (MMOC), to achieve online adaptation to unseen data. MMOC trains multiple base models using diverse strategies rooted in reconstruction and contrastive learning, enabling each model to develop distinct generalization capabilities. During inference, MMOC dynamically activates the most suitable model for each test sample via a loss-based routing mechanism that evaluates both contrastive and reconstruction losses. This dual consideration allows for a comprehensive measurement of data drift at both structural and semantic levels. Experimental results on the SEED and Dreamer datasets show that MMOC achieves state-of-the-art performance: 85.39% on SEED, and 68.77% and 69.37% on Dreamer arousal and valence dimensions, respectively. MMOC effectively mitigates inter-subject data drift, offering a practical solution for real-world EEG emotion recognition.

Title: Towards channel foundation models (CFMs): Motivations, methodologies and opportunities
Authors: Jun Jiang, Yuan Gao, Xinyi Wu, Shugong Xu
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a pivotal enabler for next-generation wireless communication systems. However, conventional AI-based models encounter several limitations, such as heavy reliance on labeled data, limited generalization capability, and task-specific design. To address these challenges, this paper introduces, for the first time, the concept of channel foundation models (CFMs)-a novel and unified framework designed to tackle a wide range of channel-related tasks through a pretrained, universal channel feature extractor. By leveraging advanced AI architectures and self-supervised learning techniques, CFMs are capable of effectively exploiting large-scale unlabeled data without the need for extensive manual annotation. We further analyze the evolution of AI methodologies, from supervised learning and multi-task learning to self-supervised learning, emphasizing the distinct advantages of the latter in facilitating the development of CFMs. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive review of existing studies on self-supervised learning in this domain, categorizing them into generative, discriminative and the combined paradigms. Given that the research on CFMs is still at an early stage, we identify several promising future research directions, focusing on model architecture innovation and the construction of high-quality, diverse channel datasets.

Title: Conan: A Chunkwise Online Network for Zero-Shot Adaptive Voice Conversion
Authors: Yu Zhang, Baotong Tian, Zhiyao Duan
Abstract: Zero-shot online voice conversion (VC) holds significant promise for real-time communications and entertainment. However, current VC models struggle to preserve semantic fidelity under real-time constraints, deliver natural-sounding conversions, and adapt effectively to unseen speaker characteristics. To address these challenges, we introduce Conan, a chunkwise online zero-shot voice conversion model that preserves the content of the source while matching the voice timbre and styles of reference speech. Conan comprises three core components: 1) a Stream Content Extractor that leverages Emformer for low-latency streaming content encoding; 2) an Adaptive Style Encoder that extracts fine-grained stylistic features from reference speech for enhanced style adaptation; 3) a Causal Shuffle Vocoder that implements a fully causal HiFiGAN using a pixel-shuffle mechanism. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Conan outperforms baseline models in subjective and objective metrics. Audio samples can be found at this https URL.

Title: Physics-Informed Unit Commitment Framework for Nuclear Reactors
Authors: Shiny Choudhury, Michael Davidson, George Tynan
Abstract: Nuclear reactors are often modeled as inflexible baseload generators with fixed downtimes and restrictive ramping constraints. In practice, however, a reactor's operational flexibility is closely tied to its fuel cycle and associated reactivity margin. A key physical constraint for power maneuverability is xenon poisoning, caused from the transient buildup of neutron-absorbing xenon following a power reduction. This transient can delay or prevent subsequent power ramp-up due to suppressed core reactivity. Additionally, if a reactor is shutdown during periods of low reactivity, restart times can vary significantly, leading to prolonged downtimes. This work introduces a physics-informed modeling framework that embeds fuel cycle dynamics within a unit commitment (UC) formulation. The framework tracks reactivity margin, dynamically enforces xenon induced constraints, and endogenously schedules refueling outages based on core conditions. By capturing intracycle reactivity evolution, the model enables operation dependent nuclear dispatch that reflects both techno-economic requirements and irreducible nuclear physics limits. Application to a representative reactor fleet shows that flexible operation can slow reactivity degradation and extend fuel cycles. Results further demonstrate that different operational modes substantially affect VRE utilization, curtailment, and nuclear fleet capacity factors. These findings highlight the importance of fuel cycle aware flexibility modeling for accurate reactor scheduling and integration of nuclear power into energy system models.

Authors: Amgad A. Salama
Abstract: Direction of arrival (DOA) estimation is a fundamental problem in array signal processing with applications spanning radar, sonar, wireless communications, and acoustic signal processing. This tutorial survey provides a comprehensive introduction to classical and modern DOA estimation methods, specifically designed for students and researchers new to the field. We focus on narrowband signal processing using uniform linear arrays, presenting step-by-step mathematical derivations with geometric intuition. The survey covers classical beamforming methods, subspace-based techniques (MUSIC, ESPRIT), maximum likelihood approaches, and sparse signal processing methods. Each method is accompanied by Python implementations available in an open-source repository, enabling reproducible research and hands-on learning. Through systematic performance comparisons across various scenarios, we provide practical guidelines for method selection and parameter tuning. This work aims to bridge the gap between theoretical foundations and practical implementation, making DOA estimation accessible to beginners while serving as a comprehensive reference for the field.

Title: Learning local and global prototypes with optimal transport for unsupervised anomaly detection and localization
Authors: Robin Trombetta, Carole Lartizien
Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection aims to detect defective parts of a sample by having access, during training, to a set of normal, i.e. defect-free, data. It has many applications in fields, such as industrial inspection or medical imaging, where acquiring labels is costly or when we want to avoid introducing biases in the type of anomalies that can be spotted. In this work, we propose a novel UAD method based on prototype learning and introduce a metric to compare a structured set of embeddings that balances a feature-based cost and a spatial-based cost. We leverage this metric to learn local and global prototypes with optimal transport from latent representations extracted with a pre-trained image encoder. We demonstrate that our approach can enforce a structural constraint when learning the prototypes, allowing to capture the underlying organization of the normal samples, thus improving the detection of incoherencies in images. Our model achieves performance that is on par with strong baselines on two reference benchmarks for anomaly detection on industrial images.

Title: Fine-grained Image Quality Assessment for Perceptual Image Restoration
Authors: Xiangfei Sheng, Xiaofeng Pan, Zhichao Yang, Pengfei Chen, Leida Li
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable achievements in perceptual image restoration (IR), creating an urgent demand for accurate image quality assessment (IQA), which is essential for both performance comparison and algorithm optimization. Unfortunately, the existing IQA metrics exhibit inherent weakness for IR task, particularly when distinguishing fine-grained quality differences among restored images. To address this dilemma, we contribute the first-of-its-kind fine-grained image quality assessment dataset for image restoration, termed FGRestore, comprising 18,408 restored images across six common IR tasks. Beyond conventional scalar quality scores, FGRestore was also annotated with 30,886 fine-grained pairwise preferences. Based on FGRestore, a comprehensive benchmark was conducted on the existing IQA metrics, which reveal significant inconsistencies between score-based IQA evaluations and the fine-grained restoration quality. Motivated by these findings, we further propose FGResQ, a new IQA model specifically designed for image restoration, which features both coarse-grained score regression and fine-grained quality ranking. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate that FGResQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IQA metrics. Codes and model weights have been released in this https URL

Title: Data-Driven Abstraction and Synthesis for Stochastic Systems with Unknown Dynamics
Authors: Mahdi Nazeri, Thom Badings, Anne-Kathrin Schmuck, Sadegh Soudjani, Alessandro Abate
Abstract: We study the automated abstraction-based synthesis of correct-by-construction control policies for stochastic dynamical systems with unknown dynamics. Our approach is to learn an abstraction from sampled data, which is represented in the form of a finite Markov decision process (MDP). In this paper, we present a data-driven technique for constructing finite-state interval MDP (IMDP) abstractions of stochastic systems with unknown nonlinear dynamics. As a distinguishing and novel feature, our technique only requires (1) noisy state-input-state observations and (2) an upper bound on the system's Lipschitz constant. Combined with standard model-checking techniques, our IMDP abstractions enable the synthesis of policies that satisfy probabilistic temporal properties (such as "reach-while-avoid") with a predefined confidence. Our experimental results show the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.

Title: Prompt-based Multimodal Semantic Communication for Multi-spectral Image Segmentation
Authors: Haoshuo Zhang, Yufei Bo, Hongwei Zhang, Meixia Tao
Abstract: Multimodal semantic communication has gained widespread attention due to its ability to enhance downstream task performance. A key challenge in such systems is the effective fusion of features from different modalities, which requires the extraction of rich and diverse semantic representations from each modality. To this end, we propose ProMSC-MIS, a Prompt-based Multimodal Semantic Communication system for Multi-spectral Image Segmentation. Specifically, we propose a pre-training algorithm where features from one modality serve as prompts for another, guiding unimodal semantic encoders to learn diverse and complementary semantic representations. We further introduce a semantic fusion module that combines cross-attention mechanisms and squeeze-and-excitation (SE) networks to effectively fuse cross-modal features. Simulation results show that ProMSC-MIS significantly outperforms benchmark methods across various channel-source compression levels, while maintaining low computational complexity and storage overhead. Our scheme has great potential for applications such as autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance.

Title: Distributed Safety-Critical MPC for Multi-Agent Formation Control and Obstacle Avoidance
Authors: Chao Wang, Shuyuan Zhang, Lei Wang
Abstract: For nonlinear multi-agent systems with high relative degrees, achieving formation control and obstacle avoidance in a distributed manner remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose a novel distributed safety-critical model predictive control (DSMPC) algorithm that incorporates discrete-time high-order control barrier functions (DHCBFs) to enforce safety constraints, alongside discrete-time control Lyapunov functions (DCLFs) to establish terminal constraints. To facilitate distributed implementation, we develop estimated neighbor states for formulating DHCBFs and DCLFs, while also devising a bound constraint to limit estimation errors and ensure convergence. Additionally, we provide theoretical guarantees regarding the feasibility and stability of the proposed DSMPC algorithm based on a mild assumption. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evidenced by the simulation results, demonstrating improved performance and reduced computation time compared to existing approaches.

Title: Combined Stochastic and Robust Optimization for Electric Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand with Nested Benders Decomposition
Authors: Sten Elling Tingstad Jacobsen, Balázs Kulcsár, Anders Lindman
Abstract: The electrification and automation of mobility are reshaping how cities operate on-demand transport systems. Managing Electric Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (EAMoD) fleets effectively requires coordinating dispatch, rebalancing, and charging decisions under multiple uncertainties, including travel demand, travel time, energy consumption, and charger availability. We address this challenge with a combined stochastic and robust model predictive control (MPC) framework. The framework integrates spatio-temporal Bayesian neural network forecasts with a multi-stage stochastic optimization model, formulated as a large-scale mixed-integer linear program. To ensure real-time applicability, we develop a tailored Nested Benders Decomposition that exploits the scenario tree structure and enables efficient parallelized solution. Stochastic optimization is employed to anticipate demand and infrastructure variability, while robust constraints on energy consumption and travel times safeguard feasibility under worst-case realizations. We evaluate the framework using high-fidelity simulations of San Francisco and Chicago. Compared with deterministic, reactive, and robust baselines, the combined stochastic and robust approach reduces median passenger waiting times by up to 36% and 95th-percentile delays by nearly 20%, while also lowering rebalancing distance by 27% and electricity costs by more than 35%. We also conduct a sensitivity analysis of battery size and vehicle efficiency, finding that energy-efficient vehicles maintain stable performance even with small batteries, whereas less efficient vehicles require larger batteries and greater infrastructure support. Our results emphasize the importance of jointly optimizing predictive control, vehicle capabilities, and infrastructure planning to enable scalable, cost-efficient EAMoD operations.

Title: Efficient and Privacy-Protecting Background Removal for 2D Video Streaming using iPhone 15 Pro Max LiDAR
Authors: Jessica Kinnevan, Naifa Alqahtani, Toral Chauhan
Abstract: Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology in consumer-grade mobile devices can be used as a replacement for traditional background removal and compositing techniques. Unlike approaches such as chroma keying and trained AI models, LiDAR's depth information is independent of subject lighting, and performs equally well in low-light and well-lit environments. We integrate the LiDAR and color cameras on the iPhone 15 Pro Max with GPU-based image processing. We use Apple's SwiftUI and Swift frameworks for user interface and backend development, and Metal Shader Language (MSL) for realtime image enhancement at the standard iPhone streaming frame rate of 60 frames per second. The only meaningful limitations of the technology are the streaming bandwidth of the depth data, which currently reduces the depth map resolution to 320x240, and any pre-existing limitations of the LiDAR IR laser to reflect accurate depth from some materials. If the LiDAR resolution on a mobile device like the iPhone can be improved to match the color image resolution, LiDAR could feasibly become the preeminent method of background removal for video applications and photography.

Title: Mitosis detection in domain shift scenarios: a Mamba-based approach
Authors: Gennaro Percannella, Mattia Sarno, Francesco Tortorella, Mario Vento
Abstract: Mitosis detection in histopathology images plays a key role in tumor assessment. Although machine learning algorithms could be exploited for aiding physicians in accurately performing such a task, these algorithms suffer from significative performance drop when evaluated on images coming from domains that are different from the training ones. In this work, we propose a Mamba-based approach for mitosis detection under domain shift, inspired by the promising performance demonstrated by Mamba in medical imaging segmentation tasks. Specifically, our approach exploits a VM-UNet architecture for carrying out the addressed task, as well as stain augmentation operations for further improving model robustness against domain shift. Our approach has been submitted to the track 1 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG) challenge. Preliminary experiments, conducted on the MIDOG++ dataset, show large room for improvement for the proposed method.

Title: A multi-task neural network for atypical mitosis recognition under domain shift
Authors: Gennaro Percannella, Mattia Sarno, Francesco Tortorella, Mario Vento
Abstract: Recognizing atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images allows physicians to correctly assess tumor aggressiveness. Although machine learning models could be exploited for automatically performing such a task, under domain shift these models suffer from significative performance drops. In this work, an approach based on multi-task learning is proposed for addressing this problem. By exploiting auxiliary tasks, correlated to the main classification task, the proposed approach, submitted to the track 2 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG) challenge, aims to aid the model to focus only on the object to classify, ignoring the domain varying background of the image. The proposed approach shows promising performance in a preliminary evaluation conducted on three distinct datasets, i.e., the MIDOG 2025 Atypical Training Set, the Ami-Br dataset, as well as the preliminary test set of the MIDOG25 challenge.

Title: Adaptive Dead-Zone Dual Sliding Mode Observer for Reliable Electrochemical Model-Based SOC Estimation
Authors: Guangdi Hu, Keyi Liao, Jian Ye, Feng Guo
Abstract: Accurate state of charge (SOC) estimation is critical for ensuring the safety, reliability, and efficiency of lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles and energy storage systems. Electrochemical models provide high fidelity for SOC estimation but introduce challenges due to parameter variations, nonlinearities, and computational complexity. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive dead-zone dual sliding mode observer(SMO) based on an improved electrochemical single-particle model. The algorithm integrates a state observer for SOC estimation and a parameter observer for online parameter adaptation. A Lyapunov-derived adaptive dead-zone is introduced to ensure stability, activating parameter updates only when the terminal voltage error lies within a rigorously defined bound. The proposed method was validated under constant-current and UDDS dynamic conditions. Results demonstrate that the adaptive dead-zone dual SMO achieves superior accuracy compared with conventional dual SMO and equivalent circuit model-based EKF methods, maintaining SOC estimation errors within 0.2% under correct initialization and below 1% under a 30% initial SOC error, with rapid convergence. Computational efficiency analysis further shows that the adaptive dead-zone dual sliding mode observer reduces execution time compared with the conventional dual SMO by limiting unnecessary parameter updates, highlighting its suitability for real-time battery management applications. Moreover, robustness under battery aging was confirmed using a cycle-aging model, where the adaptive dead-zone dual SMO maintained stable SOC estimation despite parameter drift. These findings indicate that the proposed method offers a reliable, accurate, and computationally efficient solution for SOC estimation.

Title: Multi-stream Convolutional Neural Network with Frequency Selection for Robust Speaker Verification
Authors: Wei Yao, Shen Chen, Jiamin Cui, Yaolin Lou
Abstract: Speaker verification aims to verify whether an input speech corresponds to the claimed speaker, and conventionally, this kind of system is deployed based on single-stream scenario, wherein the feature extractor operates in full frequency range. In this paper, we hypothesize that machine can learn enough knowledge to do classification task when listening to partial frequency range instead of full frequency range, which is so called frequency selection technique, and further propose a novel framework of multi-stream Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with this technique for speaker verification tasks. The proposed framework accommodates diverse temporal embeddings generated from multiple streams to enhance the robustness of acoustic modeling. For the diversity of temporal embeddings, we consider feature augmentation with frequency selection, which is to manually segment the full-band of frequency into several sub-bands, and the feature extractor of each stream can select which sub-bands to use as target frequency domain. Different from conventional single-stream solution wherein each utterance would only be processed for one time, in this framework, there are multiple streams processing it in parallel. The input utterance for each stream is pre-processed by a frequency selector within specified frequency range, and post-processed by mean normalization. The normalized temporal embeddings of each stream will flow into a pooling layer to generate fused embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments on VoxCeleb dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that multi-stream CNN significantly outperforms single-stream baseline with 20.53 % of relative improvement in minimum Decision Cost Function (minDCF).

Title: Multi Object Tracking for Predictive Collision Avoidance
Authors: Bruk Gebregziabher, Hadush Hailu
Abstract: The safe and efficient operation of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) in complex environments, such as manufacturing, logistics, and agriculture, necessitates accurate multi-object tracking and predictive collision avoidance. This paper presents algorithms and techniques for addressing these challenges using Lidar sensor data, emphasizing ensemble Kalman filter. The developed predictive collision avoidance algorithm employs the data provided by lidar sensors to track multiple objects and predict their velocities and future positions, enabling the AMR to navigate safely and effectively. A modification to the dynamic windowing approach is introduced to enhance the performance of the collision avoidance system. The overall system architecture encompasses object detection, multi-object tracking, and predictive collision avoidance control. The experimental results, obtained from both simulation and real-world data, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in various scenarios, which lays the foundation for future research on global planners, other controllers, and the integration of additional sensors. This thesis contributes to the ongoing development of safe and efficient autonomous systems in complex and dynamic environments.

Title: A Neural Speech Codec for Noise Robust Speech Coding
Authors: Jiayi Huang, Zeyu Yan, Wenbin Jiang, He Wang, Fei Wen
Abstract: This paper considers the joint compression and enhancement problem for speech signal in the presence of noise. Recently, the SoundStream codec, which relies on end-to-end joint training of an encoder-decoder pair and a residual vector quantizer by a combination of adversarial and reconstruction losses,has shown very promising performance, especially in subjective perception quality. In this work, we provide a theoretical result to show that, to simultaneously achieve low distortion and high perception in the presence of noise, there exist an optimal two-stage optimization procedure for the joint compression and enhancement problem. This procedure firstly optimizes an encoder-decoder pair using only distortion loss and then fixes the encoder to optimize a perceptual decoder using perception loss. Based on this result, we construct a two-stage training framework for joint compression and enhancement of noisy speech signal. Unlike existing training methods which are heuristic, the proposed two-stage training method has a theoretical foundation. Finally, experimental results for various noise and bit-rate conditions are provided. The results demonstrate that a codec trained by the proposed framework can outperform SoundStream and other representative codecs in terms of both objective and subjective evaluation metrics.

Title: A First-Order Gradient Approach for the Connectivity Optimization of Markov Chains
Authors: Christian P.C. Franssen, Alessandro Zocca, Bernd F. Heidergott
Abstract: Graphs are commonly used to model various complex systems, including social networks, power grids, transportation networks, and biological systems. In many applications, the connectivity of these networks can be expressed through the Mean First Passage Times (MFPTs) of a Markov chain modeling a random walker on the graph. In this paper, we generalize the network metrics based on Markov chains' MFPTs and extend them to networks affected by uncertainty, in which edges may fail and hence not be present according to a pre-determined stochastic model. To find optimally connected Markov chains, we present a parameterization-free method for optimizing the MFPTs of the Markov chain. More specifically, we present an efficient Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) algorithm in the context of Markov chain optimization. The proposed algorithm is suitable for both fixed and random networks. Using various numerical experiments, we demonstrate scalability compared to established benchmarks. Importantly, our algorithm finds an optimal solution without requiring prior knowledge of edge failure probabilities, allowing for an online optimization approach.

Title: Consensus in Multiagent Systems under communication failure
Authors: Mohamed Bentaibi, Laura Caravenna, Jean-Paul A. Gauthier, Francesco Rossi
Abstract: We consider multi-agent systems with cooperative interactions and study the convergence to consensus in the case of time-dependent connections, with possible communication failure. We prove a new condition ensuring consensus: we define a graph in which directed arrows correspond to connection functions that converge (in the weak sense) to some function with a positive integral on all intervals of the form $[t,+\infty)$. If the graph has a node reachable from all other indices, i.e.~``globally reachable'', then the system converges to consensus. We show that this requirement generalizes some known sufficient conditions for convergence, such as Moreau's or the Persistent Excitation one. We also give a second new condition, transversal to the known ones: total connectedness of the undirected graph formed by the non-vanishing of limiting functions.

Title: I2TTS: Image-indicated Immersive Text-to-speech Synthesis with Spatial Perception
Authors: Jiawei Zhang, Tian-Hao Zhang, Jun Wang, Jiaran Gao, Xinyuan Qian, Xu-Cheng Yin
Abstract: Controlling the style and characteristics of speech synthesis is crucial for adapting the output to specific contexts and user requirements. Previous Text-to-speech (TTS) works have focused primarily on the technical aspects of producing natural-sounding speech, such as intonation, rhythm, and clarity. However, they overlook the fact that there is a growing emphasis on spatial perception of synthesized speech, which may provide immersive experience in gaming and virtual reality. To solve this issue, in this paper, we present a novel multi-modal TTS approach, namely Image-indicated Immersive Text-to-speech Synthesis (I2TTS). Specifically, we introduce a scene prompt encoder that integrates visual scene prompts directly into the synthesis pipeline to control the speech generation process. Additionally, we propose a reverberation classification and refinement technique that adjusts the synthesized mel-spectrogram to enhance the immersive experience, ensuring that the involved reverberation condition matches the scene accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves high-quality scene and spatial matching without compromising speech naturalness, marking a significant advancement in the field of context-aware speech synthesis.

Title: MultiverSeg: Scalable Interactive Segmentation of Biomedical Imaging Datasets with In-Context Guidance
Authors: Hallee E. Wong, Jose Javier Gonzalez Ortiz, John Guttag, Adrian V. Dalca
Abstract: Medical researchers and clinicians often need to perform novel segmentation tasks on a set of related images. Existing methods for segmenting a new dataset are either interactive, requiring substantial human effort for each image, or require an existing set of previously labeled images. We introduce a system, MultiverSeg, that enables practitioners to rapidly segment an entire new dataset without requiring access to any existing labeled data from that task or domain. Along with the image to segment, the model takes user interactions such as clicks, bounding boxes or scribbles as input, and predicts a segmentation. As the user segments more images, those images and segmentations become additional inputs to the model, providing context. As the context set of labeled images grows, the number of interactions required to segment each new image decreases. We demonstrate that MultiverSeg enables users to interactively segment new datasets efficiently, by amortizing the number of interactions per image to achieve an accurate segmentation. Compared to using a state-of-the-art interactive segmentation method, MultiverSeg reduced the total number of clicks by 36% and scribble steps by 25% to achieve 90% Dice on sets of images from unseen tasks.

Authors: Andrew M Birnbaum, Adam Buchwald, Peter Turkeltaub, Adam Jacks, George Carra, Shreya Kannana, Yu Huang, Abhisheck Datta, Lucas C Parra, Lukas A Hirsch
Abstract: Purpose: The goal of this work was to develop a deep network for whole-head segmentation including clinical MRIs with abnormal anatomy, and compile the first public benchmark dataset for this purpose. We collected 98 MRIs with volumetric segmentation labels for a diverse set of human subjects including normal, as well as abnormal anatomy in clinical cases of stroke and disorders of consciousness. Approach: Training labels were generated by manually correcting initial automated segmentations for skin/scalp, skull, CSF, gray matter, white matter, air cavity and extracephalic air. We developed a MultiAxial network consisting of three 2D U-Net that operate independently in sagittal, axial and coronal planes and are then combined to produce a single 3D segmentation. Results: The MultiAxial network achieved a test-set Dice scores of 0.88+-0.04 (median +- interquartile range) on whole head segmentation including gray and white matter. This compared to 0.86 +- 0.04 for Multipriors and 0.79 +- 0.10 for SPM12, two standard tools currently available for this task. The MultiAxial network gains in robustness by avoiding the need for coregistration with an atlas. It performed well in regions with abnormal anatomy and on images that have been de-identified. It enables more accurate and robust current flow modeling when incorporated into ROAST, a widely-used modeling toolbox for transcranial electric this http URL: We are releasing a new state-of-the-art tool for whole-head MRI segmentation in abnormal anatomy, along with the largest volume of labeled clinical head MRIs including labels for non-brain structures. Together the model and data may serve as a benchmark for future efforts.

Title: Safety-Critical Human-Machine Shared Driving for Vehicle Collision Avoidance based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachability
Authors: Shiyue Zhao, Junzhi Zhang, Rui Zhou, Neda Masoud, Jianxiong Li, Helai Huang, Shijie Zhao
Abstract: Road safety continues to be a pressing global issue, with vehicle collisions imposing significant human, societal, and economic burdens. Human-machine shared collision avoidance in critical collision scenarios aims to aid drivers' accident avoidance through intervening only when necessary. Existing methods count on replanning collision-free trajectories and imposing human-machine tracking, which usually interrupts the driver's intent and increases the risk of conflict. This paper introduces a Reachability-Aware Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for shared control, guided by Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis. Machine intervention is activated only when the vehicle approaches the Collision Avoidance Reachable Set (CARS), which represents states where collision is unavoidable. First, we precompute the reachability distributions and the CARS by solving the Bellman equation using offline data. To reduce human-machine conflicts, we develop a driver model for sudden obstacles and propose an authority allocation strategy considering key collision avoidance features. Finally, we train a RL agent to reduce human-machine conflicts while enforcing the hard constraint of avoiding entry into the CARS. The proposed method was tested on a real vehicle platform. Results show that the controller intervenes effectively near CARS to prevent collisions while maintaining improved original driving task performance. Robustness analysis further supports its flexibility across different driver attributes.

Title: Sim-to-Real Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Based Dexterous Manipulation on Humanoids
Authors: Toru Lin, Kartik Sachdev, Linxi Fan, Jitendra Malik, Yuke Zhu
Abstract: Learning generalizable robot manipulation policies, especially for complex multi-fingered humanoids, remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches primarily rely on extensive data collection and imitation learning, which are expensive, labor-intensive, and difficult to scale. Sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative, but has mostly succeeded in simpler state-based or single-hand setups. How to effectively extend this to vision-based, contact-rich bimanual manipulation tasks remains an open question. In this paper, we introduce a practical sim-to-real RL recipe that trains a humanoid robot to perform three challenging dexterous manipulation tasks: grasp-and-reach, box lift and bimanual handover. Our method features an automated real-to-sim tuning module, a generalized reward formulation based on contact and object goals, a divide-and-conquer policy distillation framework, and a hybrid object representation strategy with modality-specific augmentation. We demonstrate high success rates on unseen objects and robust, adaptive policy behaviors -- highlighting that vision-based dexterous manipulation via sim-to-real RL is not only viable, but also scalable and broadly applicable to real-world humanoid manipulation tasks.

Title: Diffusion Dynamics Models with Generative State Estimation for Cloth Manipulation
Authors: Tongxuan Tian, Haoyang Li, Bo Ai, Xiaodi Yuan, Zhiao Huang, Hao Su
Abstract: Cloth manipulation is challenging due to its highly complex dynamics, near-infinite degrees of freedom, and frequent self-occlusions, which complicate both state estimation and dynamics modeling. Inspired by recent advances in generative models, we hypothesize that these expressive models can effectively capture intricate cloth configurations and deformation patterns from data. Therefore, we propose a diffusion-based generative approach for both perception and dynamics modeling. Specifically, we formulate state estimation as reconstructing full cloth states from partial observations and dynamics modeling as predicting future states given the current state and robot actions. Leveraging a transformer-based diffusion model, our method achieves accurate state reconstruction and reduces long-horizon dynamics prediction errors by an order of magnitude compared to prior approaches. We integrate our dynamics models with model predictive control and show that our framework enables effective cloth folding on real robotic systems, demonstrating the potential of generative models for deformable object manipulation under partial observability and complex dynamics.

Title: Breaking Free: Decoupling Forced Systems with Laplace Neural Networks
Authors: Bernd Zimmering, Cecília Coelho, Vaibhav Gupta, Maria Maleshkova, Oliver Niggemann
Abstract: Modelling forced dynamical systems - where an external input drives the system state - is critical across diverse domains such as engineering, finance, and the natural sciences. In this work, we propose Laplace-Net, a decoupled, solver-free neural framework for learning forced and delay-aware systems. It leverages a Laplace transform-based approach to decompose internal dynamics, external inputs, and initial values into established theoretical concepts, enhancing interpretability. Laplace-Net promotes transferability since the system can be rapidly re-trained or fine-tuned for new forcing signals, providing flexibility in applications ranging from controller adaptation to long-horizon forecasting. Experimental results on eight benchmark datasets - including linear, non-linear, and delayed systems - demonstrate the method's improved accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in handling complex and previously unseen inputs.

Title: SafeLink: Safety-Critical Control Under Dynamic and Irregular Unsafe Regions
Authors: Songqiao Hu, Zidong Wang, Zeyi Liu, Zhen Shen, Xiao He
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) provide a theoretical foundation for safety-critical control in robotic systems. However, most existing methods rely on the analytical expressions of unsafe state regions, which are often impractical for irregular and dynamic unsafe regions. This paper introduces SafeLink, a novel CBF construction method based on cost-sensitive incremental random vector functional-link (RVFL) neural networks. By designing a valid cost function, SafeLink assigns different sensitivities to safe and unsafe state points, thereby eliminating false negatives in classification of unsafe state points. Furthermore, an incremental update theorem is established, enabling precise real-time adaptation to changes in unsafe regions. An analytical expression for the gradient of SafeLink is also derived to facilitate control input computation. The proposed method is validated on the endpoint position control task of a nonlinear two-link manipulator. Experimental results demonstrate that the method effectively learns the unsafe regions and rapidly adapts as these regions change, achieving an update speed significantly faster than comparison methods, while safely reaching the target position.

Title: Composable Uncertainty in Symmetric Monoidal Categories for Design Problems (Extended Version)
Authors: Marius Furter, Yujun Huang, Gioele Zardini
Abstract: Applied category theory often studies symmetric monoidal categories (SMCs) whose morphisms represent open systems. These structures naturally accommodate complex wiring patterns, leveraging (co)monoidal structures for splitting and merging wires, or compact closed structures for feedback. A key example is the compact closed SMC of design problems (DP), which enables a compositional approach to co-design in engineering. However, in practice, the systems of interest may not be fully known. Recently, Markov categories have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling uncertain processes. In this work, we demonstrate how to integrate this perspective into the study of open systems while preserving consistency with the underlying SMC structure. To this end, we employ the change-of-base construction for enriched categories, replacing the morphisms of a symmetric monoidal $\mathcal{V}$-category $\mathcal{C}$ with parametric maps $A \to \mathcal{C}(X,Y)$ in a Markov category induced by a symmetric monoidal monad. This results in a symmetric monoidal 2-category $N_*\mathcal{C}$ with the same objects as $\mathcal{C}$ and reparametrization 2-cells. By choosing different monads, we capture various types of uncertainty. The category underlying $\mathcal{C}$ embeds into $N_*\mathcal{C}$ via a strict symmetric monoidal functor, allowing (co)monoidal and compact closed structures to be transferred. Applied to DP, this construction leads to categories of practical relevance, such as parametrized design problems for optimization, and parametrized distributions of design problems for decision theory and Bayesian learning.

Title: Feedback Optimization with State Constraints through Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Giannis Delimpaltadakis, Pol Mestres, Jorge Cortés, W.P.M.H. Heemels
Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of research on a class of methods called feedback optimization. These are methods to steer the state of a control system to an equilibrium that arises as the solution of an optimization problem. Despite the growing literature on the topic, the important problem of enforcing state constraints at all times remains unaddressed. In this work, we present the first feedback-optimization method that enforces state constraints. The method combines a class of dynamics called safe gradient flows with high-order control barrier functions. We provide a number of results on our proposed controller, including well-posedness guarantees, anytime constraint-satisfaction guarantees, equivalence between the closed-loop's equilibria and the optimization problem's critical points, and local asymptotic stability of optima.

Title: On Word-of-Mouth and Private-Prior Sequential Social Learning
Authors: Andrea Da Col, Cristian R. Rojas, Vikram Krishnamurthy
Abstract: Social learning constitutes a fundamental framework for studying interactions among rational agents who observe each other's actions but lack direct access to individual beliefs. This paper investigates a specific social learning paradigm known as Word-of-Mouth (WoM), where a series of agents seeks to estimate the state of a dynamical system. The first agent receives noisy measurements of the state, while each subsequent agent relies solely on a degraded version of her predecessor's estimate. A defining feature of WoM is that the final agent's belief is publicly broadcast and subsequently adopted by all agents, in place of their own. We analyze this setting theoretically and through numerical simulations, noting that some agents benefit from using the belief of the last agent, while others experience performance deterioration.

Title: Probabilistic Reachable Set Estimation for Saturated Systems with Unbounded Additive Disturbances
Authors: Carlo Karam, Matteo Tacchi-Bénard, Mirko Fiacchini
Abstract: In this paper, we present an analytical approach for the synthesis of ellipsoidal probabilistic reachable sets of saturated systems subject to unbounded additive noise. Using convex optimization methods, we compute a contraction factor of the saturated error dynamics that allows us to tightly bound its evolution and therefore construct accurate reachable sets. The proposed approach is applicable to independent, zero mean disturbances with a known covariance. A numerical example illustrates the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed design.

Title: TriPSS: A Tri-Modal Keyframe Extraction Framework Using Perceptual, Structural, and Semantic Representations
Authors: Mert Can Cakmak, Nitin Agarwal, Diwash Poudel
Abstract: Efficient keyframe extraction is critical for video summarization and retrieval, yet capturing the full semantic and visual richness of video content remains challenging. We introduce TriPSS, a tri-modal framework that integrates perceptual features from the CIELAB color space, structural embeddings from ResNet-50, and semantic context from frame-level captions generated by LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. These modalities are fused using principal component analysis to form compact multi-modal embeddings, enabling adaptive video segmentation via HDBSCAN clustering. A refinement stage incorporating quality assessment and duplicate filtering ensures the final keyframe set is both concise and semantically diverse. Evaluations on the TVSum20 and SumMe benchmarks show that TriPSS achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming both unimodal and prior multimodal approaches. These results highlight TriPSS' ability to capture complementary visual and semantic cues, establishing it as an effective solution for video summarization, retrieval, and large-scale multimedia understanding.

Title: Energy Efficiency Maximization for Movable Antenna Communication Systems
Authors: Jingze Ding, Zijian Zhou, Lipeng Zhu, Yuping Zhao, Bingli Jiao, Rui Zhang
Abstract: This paper investigates energy efficiency maximization for movable antenna (MA)-aided multi-user uplink communication systems by considering the time delay and energy consumption incurred by practical antenna movement. We first examine the special case with a single user and propose an optimization algorithm based on the one-dimensional (1D) exhaustive search to maximize the user's energy efficiency. Moreover, we derive an upper bound on the energy efficiency and analyze the conditions required to achieve this performance bound under different numbers of channel paths. Then, for the general multi-user scenario, we propose an iterative algorithm to fairly maximize the minimum energy efficiency among all users. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in improving energy efficiency compared to existing MA schemes that do not account for movement-related costs, as well as the conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) scheme. In addition, the results show the robustness of the proposed scheme to imperfect channel state information (CSI) and provide valuable insights for practical system deployment.

Title: Robustness Analysis for Quantum Systems Controlled by Continuous-Time Pulses
Authors: Sean Patrick O'Neil, Edmond Jonckheere, Sophie Schirmer
Abstract: Differential sensitivity techniques originally developed to study the robustness of energy landscape controllers are generalized to the important case of closed quantum systems subject to continuously varying controls. Vanishing sensitivity to parameter variation is shown to coincide with perfect fidelity, as was the case for time-invariant controls. Upper bounds on the magnitude of the differential sensitivity to any parameter variation are derived based simply on knowledge of the system Hamiltonian and the maximum size of the control inputs.

Title: Unscented Kalman Filter with a Nonlinear Propagation Model for Navigation Applications
Authors: Amit Levy, Itzik Klein
Abstract: The unscented Kalman filter is a nonlinear estimation algorithm commonly used in navigation applications. The prediction of the mean and covariance matrix is crucial to the stable behavior of the filter. This prediction is done by propagating the sigma points according to the dynamic model at hand. In this paper, we introduce an innovative method to propagate the sigma points according to the nonlinear dynamic model of the navigation error state vector. This improves the filter accuracy and navigation performance. We demonstrate the benefits of our proposed approach using real sensor data recorded by an autonomous underwater vehicle during several scenarios.

Title: Part Segmentation of Human Meshes via Multi-View Human Parsing
Authors: James Dickens, Kamyar Hamad
Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud deep learning have led to models that achieve high per-part labeling accuracy on large-scale point clouds, using only the raw geometry of unordered point sets. In parallel, the field of human parsing focuses on predicting body part and clothing/accessory labels from images. This work aims to bridge these two domains by enabling per-vertex semantic segmentation of large-scale human meshes. To achieve this, a pseudo-ground truth labeling pipeline is developed for the Thuman2.1 dataset: meshes are first aligned to a canonical pose, segmented from multiple viewpoints, and the resulting point-level labels are then backprojected onto the original mesh to produce per-point pseudo ground truth annotations. Subsequently, a novel, memory-efficient sampling strategy is introduced, a windowed iterative farthest point sampling (FPS) with space-filling curve-based serialization to effectively downsample the point clouds. This is followed by a purely geometric segmentation using PointTransformer, enabling semantic parsing of human meshes without relying on texture information. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach. Project code and pre-processed data is available at this https URL.

Title: Grid-Agent: An LLM-Powered Multi-Agent System for Power Grid Control
Authors: Yan Zhang
Abstract: The increasing penetration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), widespread adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs), and the growing frequency of extreme weather events have significantly increased the complexity of power grid planning, operation, and management. Traditional rule-based systems and numerical optimization approaches often struggle with the scale, dynamics, and adaptability required by modern power networks. This paper introduces Grid-Agent, an autonomous, AI-driven framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with multi-agent reinforcement learning to detect and remediate grid violations in real time. Grid-Agent integrates semantic reasoning with numerical precision through a modular agent architecture: a planning agent generates coordinated action sequences using numerical power flow solvers, while a validation agent evaluates system stability and action effectiveness via sandboxed execution with safety rollbacks. To ensure scalability, Grid-Agent incorporates an adaptive multiscale network representation that dynamically selects optimal encoding schemes based on network size and complexity. The framework enables coordinated violation resolution through optimizing switch configurations, battery deployment, and load curtailment strategies. Experimental results in standard IEEE and CIGRE test systems (IEEE 69-bus, CIGRE MV, and IEEE 30-bus) demonstrate superior violation mitigation performance. Additionally, the framework's built-in data collection and learning capabilities enable continuous learning and adaptation to diverse network topologies. The autonomous nature of the framework makes it particularly suitable for modern smart grid applications requiring rapid response to dynamic operating conditions.

Title: A State-Space Representation of Coupled Linear Multivariate PDEs and Stability Analysis using SDP
Authors: Declan S. Jagt, Matthew M. Peet
Abstract: Physical processes evolving in both time and space are often modeled using Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Recently, it has been shown how stability analysis and control of coupled PDEs in a single spatial variable can be more conveniently performed using an equivalent Partial Integral Equation (PIE) representation. The construction of this PIE representation is based on an analytic expression for the inverse of the spatial differential operator, $\partial_s^{d}$, on the domain defined by boundary conditions. In this paper, we show how this univariate representation may be extended inductively to multiple spatial variables by representing the domain as the intersection of lifted univariate domains. Specifically, we show that if each univariate domain is well-posed, then there exists a readily verified consistency condition which is necessary and sufficient for existence of an inverse to the multivariate spatial differential operator, $D^\alpha=\partial_{s_1}^{\alpha_1}\cdots\partial_{s_N}^{\alpha_N}$, on the PDE domain. Furthermore, we show that this inverse is an element of a $*$-algebra of Partial Integral (PI) operators defined by polynomial semi-separable kernels. Based on this operator algebra, we show that the evolution of any suitably well-posed linear multivariate PDE may be described by a PIE, parameterized by elements of the PI algebra. A convex computational test for PDE stability is then proposed using a positive matrix parameterization of positive PI operators, and software (PIETOOLS) is provided which automates the process of representation and stability analysis of such PDEs. This software is used to analyze stability of 2D heat, wave, and plate equations, obtaining accurate bounds on the rate of decay.

Title: Zero-shot Context Biasing with Trie-based Decoding using Synthetic Multi-Pronunciation
Authors: Changsong Liu, Yizhou Peng, Eng Siong Chng
Abstract: Contextual automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems allow for recognizing out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, such as named entities or rare words. However, it remains challenging due to limited training data and ambiguous or inconsistent pronunciations. In this paper, we propose a synthesis-driven multi-pronunciation contextual biasing method that performs zero-shot contextual ASR on a pretrained Whisper model. Specifically, we leverage text-to-speech (TTS) systems to synthesize diverse speech samples containing each target rare word, and then use the pretrained Whisper model to extract multiple predicted pronunciation variants. These variant token sequences are compiled into a prefix-trie, which assigns rewards to beam hypotheses in a shallow-fusion manner during beam-search decoding. Subsequently, any recognized variant is mapped back to the original rare word in the final transcription. The evaluation results on the LibriSpeech dataset show that our method reduces biased-word error rate (B-WER) by 43% on test-clean and 44% on test-other while maintaining unbiased-WER (U-WER) essentially unchanged.

Title: Joint Time-Position Statistics and Fisher Information in Drift-Diffusion Molecular Channels
Authors: Yun-Feng Lo, Yen-Chi Lee
Abstract: This letter derives a closed-form joint distribution of the first arrival time (FAT) and first arrival position (FAP) in diffusion-based molecular communication (MC) systems with drift. Unlike prior work that studied FAT or FAP separately, we obtain an explicit joint probability density function under constant drift and isotropic diffusion in arbitrary dimensions, revealing a nontrivial spatiotemporal coupling. Based on this result, we compute the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and show that joint observations enable estimation of lateral drift and improve sensitivity to diffusion -- capabilities not attainable with time-only or position-only models.
