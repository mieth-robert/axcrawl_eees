Title: Lossy Image Compression -- A Frequent Sequence Mining perspective employing efficient Clustering
Authors: Avinash Kadimisetty, Oswald C, Sivaselvan B, Alekhya Kadimisetty
Abstract: This work explores the scope of Frequent Sequence Mining in the domain of Lossy Image Compression. The proposed work is based on the idea of clustering pixels and using the cluster identifiers in the compression. The DCT phase in JPEG is replaced with a combination of closed frequent sequence mining and k-means clustering to handle the redundant data effectively. This method focuses mainly on applying k-means clustering in parallel to all blocks of each component of the image to reduce the compression time. Conventional GSP algorithm is refined to optimize the cardinality of patterns through a novel pruning strategy, thus achieving a good reduction in the code table size. Simulations of the proposed algorithm indicate significant gains in compression ratio and quality in relation to the existing alternatives.

Title: OCTA-Based Biomarker Characterization in nAMD
Authors: MAria Simona Tivadar, Ioana Damian, Adrian Groza, Simona Delia Nicoara
Abstract: We aim to enhance ophthalmologists' decision-making when diagnosing the Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration (nAMD). We developed three tools to analyze Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography images: (1) extracting biomarkers such as mCNV area and vessel density using image processing; (2) generating a 3D visualization of the neovascularization for a better view of the affected regions; and (3) applying an ensemble of three white box machine learning algorithms (decision tree, support vector machines and DL-Learner) for nAMD diagnosis. The learned expressions reached 100% accuracy for the training data and 68% accuracy in testing. The main advantage is that all the learned models white-box, which ensures explainability and transparency, allowing clinicians to better understand the decision-making process.

Authors: Yuanwei Liu, Hao Jiang, Xu Gan, Xiaoxia Xu, Jia Guo, Zhaolin Wang, Chongjun Ouyang, Xidong Mu, Zhiguo Ding, Arumugam Nallanathan, Octavia A. Dobre, George K. Karagiannidis, Robert Schober
Abstract: The pinching-antenna system (PASS), recently proposed as a flexible-antenna technology, has been regarded as a promising solution for several challenges in next-generation wireless networks. It provides large-scale antenna reconfiguration, establishes stable line-of-sight links, mitigates signal blockage, and exploits near-field advantages through its distinctive architecture. This article aims to present a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in PASS. The fundamental principles of PASS are first discussed, including its hardware architecture, circuit and physical models, and signal models. Several emerging PASS designs, such as segmented PASS (S-PASS), center-fed PASS (C-PASS), and multi-mode PASS (M-PASS), are subsequently introduced, and their design features are discussed. In addition, the properties and promising applications of PASS for wireless sensing are reviewed. On this basis, recent progress in the performance analysis of PASS for both communications and sensing is surveyed, and the performance gains achieved by PASS are highlighted. Existing research contributions in optimization and machine learning are also summarized, with the practical challenges of beamforming and resource allocation being identified in relation to the unique transmission structure and propagation characteristics of PASS. Finally, several variants of PASS are presented, and key implementation challenges that remain open for future study are discussed.

Title: Advances in Diffusion-Based Generative Compression
Authors: Yibo Yang, Stephan Mandt
Abstract: Popularized by their strong image generation performance, diffusion and related methods for generative modeling have found widespread success in visual media applications. In particular, diffusion methods have enabled new approaches to data compression, where realistic reconstructions can be generated at extremely low bit-rates. This article provides a unifying review of recent diffusion-based methods for generative lossy compression, with a focus on image compression. These methods generally encode the source into an embedding and employ a diffusion model to iteratively refine it in the decoding procedure, such that the final reconstruction approximately follows the ground truth data distribution. The embedding can take various forms and is typically transmitted via an auxiliary entropy model, and recent methods also explore the use of diffusion models themselves for information transmission via channel simulation. We review representative approaches through the lens of rate-distortion-perception theory, highlighting the role of common randomness and connections to inverse problems, and identify open challenges.

Title: 3D-Printed Hybrid Liquid-CPCM Cooling Modules for High-Performance Thermal Management of Lithium-Ion Pouch Cells
Authors: Xuguang Zhanga, Michael C. Halbig, Amjad Almansour, Mrityunjay Singh, Meelad Ranaiefar, Yi Zheng
Abstract: Efficient thermal management is critical for ensuring the safety, performance, and durability of lithium ion pouch cells (LIPCs), particularly under high power operating conditions where conventional battery thermal management systems (BTMS) struggle to balance cooling effectiveness, structural simplicity, and weight. Here, we report a lightweight hybrid BTMS that synergistically integrates active liquid cooling with composite phase change material (CPCM) based thermal buffering through a 3D printed hexagonal architecture. The system is fabricated via a two step additive manufacturing process that enables sealed CPCM encapsulation and isolated liquid cooling pathways within a single carbon fiber reinforced nylon module, effectively eliminating leakage risks while allowing precise geometric control. Hexagonally partitioned CPCM cavities maximize the CPCM wall interfacial area and shorten internal conduction paths, accelerating latent heat absorption, while embedded serpentine liquid channels provide continuous convective heat removal and prevent CPCM saturation. A nanocarbon enhanced CPCM is employed to overcome the intrinsic low thermal conductivity of conventional paraffin based materials.

Title: Improving Stability Margins with Grid-Forming Damper Winding Emulation
Authors: Dahlia Saba, Dominic Groß
Abstract: This work presents (i) a framework for certifying small-signal frequency stability of a power system with line dynamics and heterogeneous bus dynamics, (ii) a novel reduced-order model of damper windings in synchronous machines, and (iii) a proportional-derivative (PD) damper winding emulation control for voltage-source converters (VSCs). Damper windings have long been understood to improve the frequency synchronization between machines. However, the dynamics of the damper windings are complex, making them difficult to analyze and directly emulate in the control of VSCs. This paper derives a reduced-order model of the damper windings as a PD term that allows grid-forming controls for VSCs to emulate their effect on frequency dynamics. Next, a framework for certifying small-signal frequency stability of a network with heterogeneous bus dynamics is developed that extends prior results by incorporating line dynamics. Finally, we analytically demonstrate that PD damper winding emulation can improve the stability of grid-forming converter controls. These results are validated with electromagnetic-transient (EMT) simulation.

Title: i-Socket: Design, Development, and Pilot Evaluation of an Individualized Multi-Material, Multi-Thickness Transtibial Prosthetic Socket
Authors: Noor Alhuda Ameen, Omid Arfaie, Ramazan Unal
Abstract: The prosthetic socket is an essential part in ensuring comfort and stability for the overall prosthesis system. This study proposes a multi-material/thickness individualized transtibial prosthetic socket that focuses on providing comfort. This study aims to identify the proper material and thickness to protect Calf areas and reduce the pressure around bone areas. First, the socket is divided into four parts depending on the pressure-sensitive/tolerant regions. After identifying the thickness range for each concerned area, the thickness and material are selected based on the Pressure-Pain Threshold (PPT) test, and the finalized design is then prototyped. The prototyped individualized socket (i-Socket) is 22% lighter than the participant's own socket. Results of the pilot experiments with an amputee participant showed that the pressure inside the socket decreased by 45% and 31% for the Tibia and Fibula regions, respectively. Additionally, the self-selected CoM velocity for the walking experiment is increased by 15% compared to the similar studies in the literature. Regarding the kinematic results, symmetry in the knee and ankle joints increased by 65% and 2% when using the i-Socket compared to the results with the participant's own socket.

Title: Machine Learning-Based Evaluation of Attitude Sensor Characteristics Using Microsatellite Flight Data
Authors: Yuji Sakamoto
Abstract: Using actual flight data from a 50-cm-class microsatellite whose mission and operations have already been completed, this study re-evaluates satellite attitude determination performance and the error characteristics of onboard attitude sensors. While conventional approaches rely on batch estimation or Kalman filtering based on predefined physical models and white-noise assumptions, this research introduces a machine-learning-based approach to extract and correct structural and nonlinear error patterns embedded in real observational data. In this study, high-quality attitude determination results obtained from star sensors and a fiber optical gyro (FOG) are treated as ground truth, and machine learning is applied to coarse attitude sensor data consisting of Sun sensors and magnetic field sensors. A one-dimensional convolutional neural network (Conv1D) is employed to regressively predict attitude from short sequences of time-series sensor measurements. The model is trained and evaluated using five sets of on-orbit observation logs, with four passes used for training and one independent pass used for testing. The results show that, while conventional coarse attitude determination using the TRIAD method yields attitude errors on the order of 7 deg RMS, the proposed machine-learning approach achieves RMS errors of approximately 0.7 deg for the training data and 2-3 deg for the test data, depending on the sensor combination.

Title: A Leader-Follower Approach for The Attitude Synchronization of Multiple Rigid Body Systems on $SO(3)$
Authors: Yiliang Li, Jun-e Feng, Abdelhamid Tayebi
Abstract: This paper deals with the leader-follower attitude synchronization problem for a group of heterogeneous rigid body systems on $SO(3)$ under an undirected, connected, and acyclic graph communication topology. The proposed distributed control strategy, endowed with almost global asymptotic stability guarantees, allows the synchronization of the rigid body systems to a constant desired orientation known only to a single rigid body. Some simulation results are also provided to validate the theoretical developments and illustrate the performance of the proposed control strategy.

Title: 3D-Printed Passive Reflectors for mmWave Beam Steering via Binary Aperture Control
Authors: Mohammed E Eltayeb
Abstract: This paper presents a theory-to-hardware framework for fully passive millimeter-wave beam control aimed at extending indoor coverage. The reflecting aperture is modeled using an equivalent array-factor formulation in which each passive element contributes a reradiated field determined by the incident and desired departure angles. Building on this model, we develop two implementation-friendly passive design approaches: (i) binary (1-bit) spatial masking, which enables beam steering and multi-beam synthesis by selecting element participation on a dense lattice via an ON/OFF metallization pattern, and (ii) diffraction-order (periodic) steering, which exploits controlled aperture periodicity to place selected diffraction orders at prescribed angles. Theoretical analysis characterizes the asymptotic activation behavior of the binary mask and establishes a distribution-free lower-bound on the achievable gain. Prototypes are realized using a copper-backed 3D-printed substrate with stencil-guided conductive ink deposition. 60 GHz over-the-air measurements in single- and multi-beam configurations validate the predicted steering behavior. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that fully passive, binary-coded apertures can provide deterministic beam control and offer a scalable alternative to power-consuming reconfigurable surfaces for static indoor links.

Title: Dual Analysis of Continuous-time Economic Dispatch and Its Price Implications
Authors: Menghan Zhang, Caisheng Wang
Abstract: As load varies continuously over time, it is essential to provide continuous-time price signals that accurately reflect supply-demand balance. However, conventional discrete-time economic dispatch fails to capture the intra-temporal variations in load and generation. Its dual solution--the marginal price--may distort economic signals, leading to inefficient market incentives. To analyze these issues, this paper develops a continuous-time dispatch model and derives its dual formulation for price analysis. The continuous-time dispatch produces dual variables that can be interpreted as price signals. Piecewise time-indexed generation and price trajectories are then constructed through a parametric programming approach. The resulting price, represented by the Lagrange multiplier of the system-wide power balance constraint, evolves piecewise along the continuous-time load profile. Each segment corresponds to a critical region characterized by a set of active constraints. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of unit-specific ramping constraints on price implications. Results indicate that continuous-time generation and price trajectories provide deeper insights into the price distortions and inefficient incentives inherent in discrete-time formulations. The proposed methodology is validated on an illustrative 5-bus system and a modified IEEE RTS-2019.

Title: Optimized $k$-means color quantization of digital images in machine-based and human perception-based colorspaces
Authors: Ranjan Maitra
Abstract: Color quantization represents an image using a fraction of its original number of colors while only minimally losing its visual quality. The $k$-means algorithm is commonly used in this context, but has mostly been applied in the machine-based RGB colorspace composed of the three primary colors. However, some recent studies have indicated its improved performance in human perception-based colorspaces. We investigated the performance of $k$-means color quantization at four quantization levels in the RGB, CIE-XYZ, and CIE-LUV/CIE-HCL colorspaces, on 148 varied digital images spanning a wide range of scenes, subjects and settings. The Visual Information Fidelity (VIF) measure numerically assessed the quality of the quantized images, and showed that in about half of the cases, $k$-means color quantization is best in the RGB space, while at other times, and especially for higher quantization levels ($k$), the CIE-XYZ colorspace is where it usually does better. There are also some cases, especially at lower $k$, where the best performance is obtained in the CIE-LUV colorspace. Further analysis of the performances in terms of the distributions of the hue, chromaticity and luminance in an image presents a nuanced perspective and characterization of the images for which each colorspace is better for $k$-means color quantization.

Title: Beyond Lips: Integrating Gesture and Lip Cues for Robust Audio-visual Speaker Extraction
Authors: Zexu Pan, Xinyuan Qian, Shengkui Zhao, Kun Zhou, Bin Ma
Abstract: Most audio-visual speaker extraction methods rely on synchronized lip recording to isolate the speech of a target speaker from a multi-talker mixture. However, in natural human communication, co-speech gestures are also temporally aligned with speech, often emphasizing specific words or syllables. These gestures provide complementary visual cues that can be especially valuable when facial or lip regions are occluded or distant. In this work, we move beyond lip-centric approaches and propose SeLG, a model that integrates both lip and upper-body gesture information for robust speaker extraction. SeLG features a cross-attention-based fusion mechanism that enables each visual modality to query and selectively attend to relevant speech features in the mixture. To improve the alignment of gesture representations with speech dynamics, SeLG also employs a contrastive InfoNCE loss that encourages gesture embeddings to align more closely with corresponding lip embeddings, which are more strongly correlated with speech. Experimental results on the YGD dataset, containing TED talks, demonstrate that the proposed contrastive learning strategy significantly improves gesture-based speaker extraction, and that our proposed SeLG model, by effectively fusing lip and gesture cues with an attention mechanism and InfoNCE loss, achieves superior performance compared to baselines, across both complete and partial (i.e., missing-modality) conditions.

Title: Structural Monotonicity in Transmission Scheduling for Remote State Estimation with Hidden Channel Mode
Authors: Hampei Sasahara
Abstract: This study treats transmission scheduling for remote state estimation over unreliable channels with a hidden mode. A local Kalman estimator selects scheduling actions, such as power allocation and resource usage, and communicates with a remote estimator based on acknowledgement feedback, balancing estimation performance and communication cost. The resulting problem is naturally formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). In settings with observable channel modes, it is well known that monotonicity of the value function can be established via investigating order-preserving property of transition kernels. In contrast, under partial observability, the transition kernels generally lack this property, which prevents the direct application of standard monotonicity arguments. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a novel technique, referred to as state-space folding, which induces transformed transition kernels recovering order preservation on the folded space. This transformation enables a rigorous monotonicity analysis in the partially observable setting. As a representative implication, we focus on an associated optimal stopping formulation and show that the resulting optimal scheduling policy admits a threshold structure.

Title: LuSeeL: Language-queried Binaural Universal Sound Event Extraction and Localization
Authors: Zexu Pan, Shengkui Zhao, Yukun Ma, Haoxu Wang, Yiheng Jiang, Biao Tian, Bin Ma
Abstract: Most universal sound extraction algorithms focus on isolating a target sound event from single-channel audio mixtures. However, the real world is three-dimensional, and binaural audio, which mimics human hearing, can capture richer spatial information, including sound source location. This spatial context is crucial for understanding and modeling complex auditory scenes, as it inherently informs sound detection and extraction. In this work, we propose a language-driven universal sound extraction network that isolates text-described sound events from binaural mixtures by effectively leveraging the spatial cues present in binaural signals. Additionally, we jointly predict the direction of arrival (DoA) of the target sound using spatial features from the extraction network. This dual-task approach exploits complementary location information to improve extraction performance while enabling accurate DoA estimation. Experimental results on the in-the-wild AudioCaps dataset show that our proposed LuSeeL model significantly outperforms single-channel and uni-task baselines.

Title: Recover Cell Tensor: Diffusion-Equivalent Tensor Completion for Fluorescence Microscopy Imaging
Authors: Chenwei Wang, Zhaoke Huang, Zelin Li, Wenqi Zhu
Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy (FM) imaging is a fundamental technique for observing live cell division, one of the most essential processes in the cycle of life and death. Observing 3D live cells requires scanning through the cell volume while minimizing lethal phototoxicity. That limits acquisition time and results in sparsely sampled volumes with anisotropic resolution and high noise. Existing image restoration methods, primarily based on inverse problem modeling, assume known and stable degradation processes and struggle under such conditions, especially in the absence of high-quality reference volumes. In this paper, from a new perspective, we propose a novel tensor completion framework tailored to the nature of FM imaging, which inherently involves nonlinear signal degradation and incomplete observations. Specifically, FM imaging with equidistant Z-axis sampling is essentially a tensor completion task under a uniformly random sampling condition. On one hand, we derive the theoretical lower bound for exact cell tensor completion, validating the feasibility of accurately recovering 3D cell tensor. On the other hand, we reformulate the tensor completion problem as a mathematically equivalent score-based generative model. By incorporating structural consistency priors, the generative trajectory is effectively guided toward denoised and geometrically coherent reconstructions. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on SR-CACO-2 and three real \textit{in vivo} cellular datasets, showing substantial improvements in both signal-to-noise ratio and structural fidelity.

Title: SynthRM: A Synthetic Data Platform for Vision-Aided Mobile System Simulation
Authors: Yingzhe Mao, Chao Zou, Yanqun Tang
Abstract: Vision-aided wireless sensing is emerging as a cornerstone of 6G mobile computing. While data-driven approaches have advanced rapidly, establishing a precise geometric correspondence between ego-centric visual data and radio propagation remains a challenge. Existing paradigms typically either associate 2D topology maps and auxiliary information with radio maps, or provide 3D perspective views limited by sparse radio data. This spatial representation flattens the complex vertical interactions such as occlusion and diffraction that govern signal behavior in urban environments, rendering the task of cross-view signal inference mathematically ill-posed. To resolve this geometric ambiguity, we introduce SynthRM, a scalable synthetic data platform. SynthRM implements a Visible-Aligned-Surface simulation strategy: rather than probing a global volumetric grid, it performs ray-tracing directly onto the geometry exposed to the sensor. This approach ensures pixel-level consistency between visual semantics and electromagnetic response, transforming the learning objective into a physically well-posed problem. We demonstrate the platform's capabilities by presenting a diverse, city-scale dataset derived from procedurally generated environments. By combining efficient procedural synthesis with high-fidelity electromagnetic modeling, SynthRM provides a transparent, accessible foundation for developing next-generation mobile systems for environment-aware sensing and communication.

Title: SE-DiCoW: Self-Enrolled Diarization-Conditioned Whisper
Authors: Alexander Polok, Dominik Klement, Samuele Cornell, Matthew Wiesner, Jan Černocký, Sanjeev Khudanpur, Lukáš Burget
Abstract: Speaker-attributed automatic speech recognition (ASR) in multi-speaker environments remains a major challenge. While some approaches achieve strong performance when fine-tuned on specific domains, few systems generalize well across out-of-domain datasets. Our prior work, Diarization-Conditioned Whisper (DiCoW), leverages speaker diarization outputs as conditioning information and, with minimal fine-tuning, demonstrated strong multilingual and multi-domain performance. In this paper, we address a key limitation of DiCoW: ambiguity in Silence-Target-Non-target-Overlap (STNO) masks, where two or more fully overlapping speakers may have nearly identical conditioning despite differing transcriptions. We introduce SE-DiCoW (Self-Enrolled Diarization-Conditioned Whisper), which uses diarization output to locate an enrollment segment anywhere in the conversation where the target speaker is most active. This enrollment segment is used as fixed conditioning via cross-attention at each encoder layer. We further refine DiCoW with improved data segmentation, model initialization, and augmentation. Together, these advances yield substantial gains: SE-DiCoW reduces macro-averaged tcpWER by 52.4% relative to the original DiCoW on the EMMA MT-ASR benchmark.

Title: A Hybrid BLE-Wi-Fi Communication Architecture for Adaptive Imaging in Wireless Capsule Endoscopy
Authors: Ziyao Zhou, Zhuoran Sun, Chen Shen, Xinyi Shen, Zhehao Lu, Sikkandar, Hen-Wei Huang
Abstract: Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) is fundamentally constrained by limited wireless bandwidth, resulting in low imaging resolution and frame rate, which can cause motion blur and missed lesions. Although adaptive frame-rate schemes have been explored to accommodate transient gastrointestinal (GI) motility, these approaches typically require sacrificing image resolution. The use of higher-frequency communication bands is further limited by increased tissue attenuation. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and WiFi communication architecture that combines the low-power operation of BLE with the high data throughput of WiFi. We systematically evaluate the performance of BLE and WiFi under tissue-mimicking conditions by measuring throughput, received signal strength indicator (RSSI), and power consumption. The results demonstrate that amplified BLE with an adaptive transmission power control strategy provides a stable frame rate at low power consumption, while 2.4 GHz WiFi operating in station mode is the most suitable high-throughput communication configuration for WCE. Compared with WiFi, BLE reduces power consumption by approximately ten times, whereas WiFi achieves up to ten times higher throughput. To reconcile these complementary trade-offs, we further introduce a hybrid system with a frame-boundary-synchronized switching mechanism to ensure lossless data transmission during BLE and WiFi transitions. Experimental results show that the switching latency from BLE to WiFi is approximately 92.66 ms, which is longer than the WiFi-to-BLE switching latency of 15.49 ms when transmitting 10 kB image payloads. Overall, the proposed hybrid BLE and WiFi system enables robust, lossless, and energy-efficient mode switching, supports adaptive imaging, and advances the development of next-generation autonomous WCE platforms.

Title: Reevaluating Bluetooth Low Energy for Ingestible Electronics
Authors: Ziyao Zhou, Zhuoran Sun, Xinyi Shen, Yang Li, Zhenhao Shi, Yixuan Yu, Hen-Wei Huang
Abstract: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has been widely adopted in wearable devices; however, it has not been widely used in ingestible electronics, primarily due to concerns regarding severe tissue attenuation at the 2.4 GHz band. In this work, we systematically reevaluate the feasibility of BLE for ingestible applications by benchmarking its performance against representative sub-GHz communication schemes across power consumption, throughput, tissue-induced attenuation, latency, and system-level integration constraints. We demonstrate that incorporating an RF amplifier enables BLE to maintain robust communication links through tissue-mimicking media while preserving favorable energy efficiency. We further quantify the relationship between throughput and energy consumption over a wide operating range and demonstrate that, for the majority of ingestible sensing applications with throughput requirements below 100 kbps, BLE achieves substantially lower power consumption than sub-GHz alternatives. End-to-end latency measurements show that BLE offers significantly lower latency than sub-GHz solutions due to its native compatibility with modern computing infrastructure. Finally, we analyze antenna form factor and ecosystem integration, highlighting the mechanical and translational advantages of BLE in ingestible system design. Collectively, these results demonstrate that BLE, when appropriately configured, represents a compelling and scalable wireless communication solution for next-generation ingestible electronics.

Title: Magnetic Resonance Simulation of Effective Transverse Relaxation (T2*)
Authors: Hidenori Takeshima
Abstract: Purpose: To simulate effective transverse relaxation ($T_2^*$) as a part of MR simulation. $T_2^*$ consists of reversible ($T_2^{\prime}$) and irreversible ($T_2$) components. Whereas simulations of $T_2$ are easy, $T_2^{\prime}$ is not easily simulated if only magnetizations of individual isochromats are simulated. Theory and Methods: Efficient methods for simulating $T_2^{\prime}$ were proposed. To approximate the Lorentzian function of $T_2^{\prime}$ realistically, conventional simulators require 100+ isochromats. This approximation can be avoided by utilizing a linear phase model for simulating an entire Lorentzian function directly. To represent the linear phase model, the partial derivatives of the magnetizations with respect to the frequency axis were also simulated. To accelerate the simulations with these partial derivatives, the proposed methods introduced two techniques: analytic solutions, and combined transitions. For understanding the fundamental mechanism of the proposed method, a simple one-isochromat simulation was performed. For evaluating realistic cases, several pulse sequences were simulated using two phantoms with and without $T_2^{\prime}$ simulations. Results: The one-isochromat simulation demonstrated that $T_2^{\prime}$ simulations were possible. In the realistic cases, $T_2^{\prime}$ was recovered as expected without using 100+ isochromats for each point. The computational times with $T_2^{\prime}$ simulations were only 2.0 to 2.7 times longer than those without $T_2^{\prime}$ simulations. When the above-mentioned two techniques were utilized, the analytic solutions accelerated 19 times, and the combined transitions accelerated up to 17 times. Conclusion: Both theory and results showed that the proposed methods simulated $T_2^{\prime}$ efficiently by utilizing a linear model with a Lorentzian function, analytic solutions, and combined transitions.

Title: Exponentially Consistent Low-Complexity Outlier Hypothesis Testing for Continuous Sequences
Authors: Lina Zhu, Lin Zhou
Abstract: In this work, we revisit outlier hypothesis testing and propose exponentially consistent, low-complexity fixed-length tests that achieve a better tradeoff between detection performance and computational complexity than existing exhaustive-search methods. In this setting, the goal is to identify outlying sequences from a set of observed sequences, where most sequences are i.i.d. from a nominal distribution and outliers are i.i.d. from a different anomalous distribution. While prior work has primarily focused on discrete-valued sequences, we extend the results of Bu et al. (TSP 2019) to continuous-valued sequences and develop a distribution-free test based on the MMD metric. Our framework handles both known and unknown numbers of outliers. In the unknown-count case, we bound the detection performance and characterize the tradeoff among the exponential decay rates of three types of error probabilities. Finally, we quantify the performance penalty incurred when the number of outliers is unknown.

Title: Output Feedback Stabilization of Linear Systems via Policy Gradient Methods
Authors: Ankang Zhang, Ming Chi, Xiaoling Wang, Lintao Ye
Abstract: Stabilizing a dynamical system is a fundamental problem that serves as a cornerstone for many complex tasks in the field of control systems. The problem becomes challenging when the system model is unknown. Among the Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms that have been successfully applied to solve problems pertaining to unknown linear dynamical systems, the policy gradient (PG) method stands out due to its ease of implementation and can solve the problem in a model-free manner. However, most of the existing works on PG methods for unknown linear dynamical systems assume full-state feedback. In this paper, we take a step towards model-free learning for partially observable linear dynamical systems with output feedback and focus on the fundamental stabilization problem of the system. We propose an algorithmic framework that stretches the boundary of PG methods to the problem without global convergence guarantees. We show that by leveraging zeroth-order PG update based on system trajectories and its convergence to stationary points, the proposed algorithms return a stabilizing output feedback policy for discrete-time linear dynamical systems. We also explicitly characterize the sample complexity of our algorithm and verify the effectiveness of the algorithm using numerical examples.

Title: Reinforced Rate Control for Neural Video Compression via Inter-Frame Rate-Distortion Awareness
Authors: Wuyang Cong, Junqi Shi, Lizhong Wang, Weijing Shi, Ming Lu, Hao Chen, Zhan Ma
Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) has demonstrated superior compression efficiency, yet effective rate control remains a significant challenge due to complex temporal dependencies. Existing rate control schemes typically leverage frame content to capture distortion interactions, overlooking inter-frame rate dependencies arising from shifts in per-frame coding parameters. This often leads to suboptimal bitrate allocation and cascading parameter decisions. To address this, we propose a reinforcement-learning (RL)-based rate control framework that formulates the task as a frame-by-frame sequential decision process. At each frame, an RL agent observes a spatiotemporal state and selects coding parameters to optimize a long-term reward that reflects rate-distortion (R-D) performance and bitrate adherence. Unlike prior methods, our approach jointly determines bitrate allocation and coding parameters in a single step, independent of group of pictures (GOP) structure. Extensive experiments across diverse NVC architectures show that our method reduces the average relative bitrate error to 1.20% and achieves up to 13.45% bitrate savings at typical GOP sizes, outperforming existing approaches. In addition, our framework demonstrates improved robustness to content variation and bandwidth fluctuations with lower coding overhead, making it highly suitable for practical deployment.

Title: Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces-Based Electromagnetic Wave Domain Interference-Free Precoding
Authors: Hetong Wang, Yashuai Cao, Tiejun Lv, Jintao Wang, Ni Wei, Jiancheng An, Chau Yuen
Abstract: This paper introduces an interference-free multi-stream transmission architecture leveraging stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs), from a new perspective of interference exploitation. Unlike traditional interference exploitation precoding (IEP) which relies on computational hardware circuitry, we perform the precoding operations within the analog wave domain provided by SIMs. However, the benefits of SIM-enabled IEP are limited by the nonlinear distortion (NLD) caused by power amplifiers. A hardware-efficient interference-free transmitter architecture is developed to exploit SIM's high and flexible degree of freedom (DoF), where the NLD on modulated symbols can be directly compensated in the wave domain. Moreover, we design a frame-level SIM configuration scheme and formulate a maxmin problem on the safety margin function. With respect to the optimization of SIM phase shifts, we propose a recursive oblique manifold (ROM) algorithm to tackle the complex coupling among phase shifts across multiple layers. A flexible DoF-driven antenna selection (AS) scheme is explored in the SIM-enabled IEP system. Using an ROM-based alternating optimization (ROM-AO) framework, our approach jointly optimizes transmit AS, SIM phase shift design, and power allocation (PA), and develops a greedy safety margin-based AS algorithm. Simulations show that the proposed SIM-enabled frame-level IEP scheme significantly outperforms benchmarks. Specifically, the strategy with AS and PA can achieve a 20 dB performance gain compared to the case without any strategy under the 12 dB signal-to-noise ratio, which confirms the superiority of the NLD-aware IEP scheme and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Title: Eco-Driving Control for Electric Vehicles with Multi-Speed Transmission: Optimizing Vehicle Speed and Powertrain Operation in Dynamic Environments
Authors: Suiyi He, Zongxuan Sun
Abstract: This article presents an eco-driving algorithm for electric vehicles featuring multi-speed transmissions. The proposed controller is formulated as a co-optimization problem, simultaneously optimizing both vehicle longitudinal speed and powertrain operation to maximize energy efficiency. Constraints derived from a connected vehicle based traffic prediction algorithm are used to ensure traffic safety and smooth traffic flow in dynamic environments with multiple signalized intersections and mixed traffic. By simplifying the complex, nonlinear mixed integer problem, the proposed controller achieves computational efficiency, enabling real-time implementation. To evaluate its performance, traffic scenarios from both Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) and real-world road tests are employed. The results demonstrate a notable reduction in energy consumption by up to 11.36\% over an \SI{18}{\km} drive.

Title: AMGFormer: Adaptive Multi-Granular Transformer for Brain Tumor Segmentation with Missing Modalities
Authors: Chengxiang Guo, Jian Wang, Junhua Fei, Xiao Li, Chunling Chen, Yun Jin
Abstract: Multimodal MRI is essential for brain tumor segmentation, yet missing modalities in clinical practice cause existing methods to exhibit >40% performance variance across modality combinations, rendering them clinically unreliable. We propose AMGFormer, achieving significantly improved stability through three synergistic modules: (1) QuadIntegrator Bridge (QIB) enabling spatially adaptive fusion maintaining consistent predictions regardless of available modalities, (2) Multi-Granular Attention Orchestrator (MGAO) focusing on pathological regions to reduce background sensitivity, and (3) Modality Quality-Aware Enhancement (MQAE) preventing error propagation from corrupted sequences. On BraTS 2018, our method achieves 89.33% WT, 82.70% TC, 67.23% ET Dice scores with <0.5% variance across 15 modality combinations, solving the stability crisis.

Title: Cooperative Double IRS aided Secure Communication for MIMO-OFDM Systems
Authors: Weijie Xiong, Jingran Lin, Di Jiang, Yuhan Zhang, Kai Zhong, Qiang Li
Abstract: Cooperative double intelligent reflecting surface (double-IRS) has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing physical layer security (PLS) in MIMO systems. However, existing studies are limited to narrowband scenarios and fail to address wideband MIMO-OFDM. In this regime, frequency-flat IRS phases and cascaded IRS links cause severe coupling, rendering narrowband designs inapplicable. To overcome this challenge, we introduce cooperative double-IRS-assisted wideband MIMO-OFDM and propose an efficient manifold-based solution. By regarding the power and constant modulus constraints as Riemannian manifolds, we reformulate the non-convex secrecy sum rate maximization as an unconstrained optimization on a product manifold. Building on this formulation, we further develop a product Riemannian gradient descent (PRGD) algorithm with guaranteed stationary convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme effectively resolves the OFDM coupling issue and achieves significant secrecy rate gains, outperforming single-IRS and distributed multi-IRS benchmarks by 32.0% and 22.3%, respectively.

Title: AoI-Driven Queue Management and Power Control in V2V Networks: A GNN-Enhanced MARL Approach
Authors: Hao Fang, Xiao Li, Chongtao Guo, Le Liang, Shi Jin
Abstract: Queue management and resource allocation play a critical role in enabling cooperative status awareness in vehicular networks. This paper investigates the problem of age of information (AoI)-aware status updates in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, where each vehicle's status is represented by multiple interdependent packets. To enable fine-grained queue management at the packet level under resource constraints, we formulate a joint optimization problem that simultaneously learns active packet dropping and transmit power control strategies. A hybrid action space is designed to support both discrete dropping decisions and continuous power control. To exploit the graph-structured interference inherent in V2V topology, a graph neural network (GNN) is introduced to aggregate slowly varying large-scale fading, allowing agents to capture topological dependencies implicitly without frequent message exchange. The overall framework is built upon multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO), with centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE). Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces average AoI across a wide range of network densities, channel conditions, and traffic loads, consistently outperforming several baselines.

Title: Physical Human-Robot Interaction: A Critical Review of Safety Constraints
Authors: Riccardo Zanella, Federico Califano, Stefano Stramigioli
Abstract: This paper aims to provide a clear and rigorous understanding of commonly recognized safety constraints in physical human-robot interaction, i.e. ISO/TS 15066, by examining how they are obtained and which assumptions support them. We clarify the interpretation and practical impact of key simplifying assumptions, show how these modeling choices affect both safety and performance across the system, and indicate specific design parameters that can be adjusted in safety-critical control implementations. Numerical examples are provided to quantify performance degradation induced by common approximations and simplifying design choices. Furthermore, the fundamental role of energy in safety assessment is emphasized, and focused insights are offered on the existing body of work concerning energy-based safety methodologies.

Title: Permutation-Invariant Physics-Informed Neural Network for Region-to-Region Sound Field Reconstruction
Authors: Xingyu Chen, Sipei Zhao, Fei Ma, Eva Cheng, Ian S. Burnett
Abstract: Most existing sound field reconstruction methods target point-to-region reconstruction, interpolating the Acoustic Transfer Functions (ATFs) between a fixed-position sound source and a receiver region. The applicability of these methods is limited because real-world ATFs tend to varying continuously with respect to the positions of sound sources and receiver regions. This paper presents a permutation-invariant physics-informed neural network for region-to-region sound field reconstruction, which aims to interpolate the ATFs across continuously varying sound sources and measurement regions. The proposed method employs a deep set architecture to process the receiver and sound source positions as an unordered set, preserving acoustic reciprocity. Furthermore, it incorporates the Helmholtz equation as a physical constraint to guide network training, ensuring physically consistent predictions.

Title: Master-Assisted Distributed Uplink Operation for Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks
Authors: Andreas Angelou, Pourya Behmandpoor, Marc Moonen
Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-output is considered a promising technology for the next generation of wireless communication networks. The main idea is to distribute a large number of access points (APs) in a geographical region to serve the user equipments (UEs) cooperatively. In the uplink, one of two types of operations is often adopted: centralized or distributed. In centralized operation, channel estimation and data decoding are performed at the central processing unit (CPU), whereas in distributed operation, channel estimation occurs at the APs and data detection at the CPU. In this paper, we propose a novel uplink operation, termed Master-Assisted Distributed Uplink Operation (MADUO), where each UE is assigned a master AP, which receives soft data estimates from the other APs and decodes the data using its local signals and the received data estimates. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed operation performs comparably to the centralized operation and balances fronthaul signaling and computational complexity.

Title: Design of RIS-aided mMTC+ Networks for Rate Maximization under the Finite Blocklength Regime with Imperfect Channel Knowledge
Authors: Sergi Liesegang, Antonio Pascual-Iserte, Olga Muñoz, Alessio Zappone
Abstract: Within the context of massive machine-type communications+, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) represent a promising technology to boost system performance in scenarios with poor channel conditions. Considering single-antenna sensors transmitting short data packets to a multiple-antenna collector node, we introduce and design an RIS to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) of the system working in the finite blocklength regime. Due to the large number of reflecting elements and their passive nature, channel estimation errors may occur. In this letter, we then propose a robust RIS optimization to combat such a detrimental issue. Based on concave bounds and approximations, the nonconvex WSR problem for the RIS response is addressed via successive convex optimization (SCO). Numerical experiments validate the performance and complexity of the SCO solutions.

Title: Cramer-Rao Bound for Arbitrarily Constrained Sets
Authors: Heedong Do, Angel Lozano
Abstract: This paper presents a Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for the estimation of parameters confined to an arbitrary set. Unlike existing results that rely on equality or inequality constraints, manifold structures, or the nonsingularity of the Fisher information matrix, the derived CRB applies to any constrained set and holds for any estimation bias and any Fisher information matrix. The key geometric object governing the new CRB is the tangent cone to the constraint set, whose span determines how the constraints affect the estimation accuracy. This CRB subsumes, unifies, and generalizes known special cases, offering an intuitive and broadly applicable framework to characterize the minimum mean-square error of constrained estimators.

Title: Audio Deepfake Detection at the First Greeting: "Hi!"
Authors: Haohan Shi, Xiyu Shi, Safak Dogan, Tianjin Huang, Yunxiao Zhang
Abstract: This paper focuses on audio deepfake detection under real-world communication degradations, with an emphasis on ultra-short inputs (0.5-2.0s), targeting the capability to detect synthetic speech at a conversation opening, e.g., when a scammer says "Hi." We propose Short-MGAA (S-MGAA), a novel lightweight extension of Multi-Granularity Adaptive Time-Frequency Attention, designed to enhance discriminative representation learning for short, degraded inputs subjected to communication processing and perturbations. The S-MGAA integrates two tailored modules: a Pixel-Channel Enhanced Module (PCEM) that amplifies fine-grained time-frequency saliency, and a Frequency Compensation Enhanced Module (FCEM) to supplement limited temporal evidence via multi-scale frequency modeling and adaptive frequency-temporal interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that S-MGAA consistently surpasses nine state-of-the-art baselines while achieving strong robustness to degradations and favorable efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, including low RTF, competitive GFLOPs, compact parameters, and reduced training cost, highlighting its strong potential for real-time deployment in communication systems and edge devices.

Title: Exposure-Aware Beamforming for mmWave Systems: From EM Theory to Thermal Compliance
Authors: Zihan Zhou, Ang Chen, Yunfei Chen, Weidong Wang, Li Chen
Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) exposure compliance has long been recognized as a crucial aspect of communications terminal designs. However, accurately assessing the impact of EM exposure for proper design strategies remains challenging. In this paper, we develop a long-term thermal EM exposure constraint model and propose a novel adaptive exposure-aware beamforming design for an mmWave uplink system. Specifically, we first establish an equivalent channel model based on Maxwell's radiation equations, which accurately captures the EM physical effects. Then, we derive a closed-form thermal impulse response model from the Pennes bioheat transfer equation (BHTE), characterizing the thermal inertia of tissue. Inspired by this model, we formulate a beamforming optimization problem that translates rigid instantaneous exposure limits into a flexible long-term thermal budget constraint. Furthermore, we develop a low-complexity online beamforming algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization theory, obtaining a closed-form near-optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively stabilizes tissue temperature near a predefined safety threshold and significantly outperforms the conventional scheme with instantaneous exposure constraints.

Title: Robust Design of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces for Parameter Estimation in MTC
Authors: Sergi Liesegang, Antonio Pascual-Iserte, Olga Muñoz
Abstract: This paper introduces a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to support parameter estimation in machine-type communications (MTC). We focus on a network where single-antenna sensors transmit spatially correlated measurements to a multiple-antenna collector node (CN) via non-orthogonal multiple access. We propose an estimation scheme based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. We also integrate successive interference cancelation (SIC) at the receiver to mitigate communication failures in noisy and interference-prone channels under the finite blocklength (FBL) regime. Moreover, recognizing the importance of channel state information (CSI), we explore various methodologies for its acquisition at the CN. We statistically design the RIS configuration and SIC decoding order to minimize estimation error while accounting for channel temporal variations and short packet lengths. To mirror practical systems, we incorporate the detrimental effects of FBL communication and imperfect CSI errors in our analysis. Simulations demonstrate that larger reflecting surfaces lead to smaller MSEs and underscore the importance of selecting an appropriate decoding order for accuracy and ultimate performance.

Title: Initial Characterization of Healthy and Malignant in vivo and ex vivo Human Colon Tissues under Surgery Procedures
Authors: Sergio Micó-Rosa, Concepcion Garcia-Pardo, Matteo Frasson, Narcis Cardona, Vicente Pons-Beltrán, Pedro López-Muñoz
Abstract: The dielectric characterization of human tissues can play a crucial role in the development of new medical diagnostic tools. In particular, the characterization of healthy and pathological tissues can provide vital information for diagnosis. In this paper, preliminary results from a small-scale measurement campaign conducted in 0.5-26.5GHz during real surgeries on healthy and malignant human colon tissues are presented. Those measurements were carried out externally to the colon, without direct contact to the tumor growing inside the colon. Furthermore, different tumor stages are taken into account. Initial findings reveal that advanced tumor stages are related with increased higher values of dielectric properties in malignant tumor tissues compared to the healthy ones.

Title: Improved Initialization for Port-Hamiltonian Neural Network Models
Authors: G.J.E. van Otterdijk, S. Weiland, M. Schoukens
Abstract: Port-Hamiltonian neural networks have shown promising results in the identification of nonlinear dynamics of complex systems, as their combination of physical principles with data-driven learning allows for accurate modelling. However, due to the non-convex optimization problem inherent in learning the correct network parameters, the training procedure is prone to converging to local minima, potentially leading to poor performance. In order to avoid this issue, this paper proposes an improved initialization for port-Hamiltonian neural networks. The core idea is to first estimate a linear port-Hamiltonian system to be used as an initialization for the network, after which the neural network adapts to the system nonlinearities, reducing the training times and improving convergence. The effectiveness of this method is tested on a chained mass-spring-damper setup for varying noise levels and compared to the original approach.

Title: Robust Covariance-Based DoA Estimation under Weather-Induced Distortion
Authors: Chenyang Yan, Geert Leus, Mats Bengtsson
Abstract: We investigate robust direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation for sensor arrays operating in adverse weather conditions, where weather-induced distortions degrade estimation accuracy. Building on a physics-based $S$-matrix model established in prior work, we adopt a statistical characterization of random phase and amplitude distortions caused by multiple scattering in rain. Based on this model, we develop a measurement framework for uniform linear arrays (ULAs) that explicitly incorporates such distortions. To mitigate their impact, we exploit the Hermitian Toeplitz (HT) structure of the covariance matrix to reduce the number of parameters to be estimated. We then apply a generalized least squares (GLS) approach for calibration. Simulation results show that the proposed method effectively suppresses rain-induced distortions, improves DoA estimation accuracy, and enhances radar sensing performance in challenging weather conditions.

Title: Data-Driven Predictive Control for Wide-Area Power Oscillation Damping
Authors: Giacomo Mastroddi, Jan Poland, Mats Larsson, Keith Moffat
Abstract: We study damping of inter-area oscillations in transmission grids using voltage-source-converter-based high-voltage direct-current (VSC-HVDC) links. Conventional power oscillation damping controllers rely on system models that are difficult to obtain in practice. Data-driven Predictive Control (DPC) addresses this limitation by replacing explicit models with data. We apply AutoRegressive with eXogenous inputs (ARX)-based predictive control and its Transient Predictive Control (TPC) variant, and compare them with Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) and two standard model-based controllers. The methods are evaluated in simulation on a system exhibiting both inter-area and local oscillation modes. ARX-based predictive control and DeePC both achieve effective damping, while the ARX-based methods require less online computation. Using warm-started, pre-factorized operator-splitting solvers, ARX/TPC control actions are computed in less than 1ms. These results demonstrate that DPC is a viable approach for power-system oscillation damping for the given test case.

Title: Cell-Free MIMO in Space: Cooperative Satellite Transmission with Multi-Antenna Ground Users
Authors: Parisa Ramezani, Emil Björnson
Abstract: This paper develops a multi-user downlink communication framework for distributed low Earth orbit satellite networks serving ground users equipped with multiple antennas. Building upon the concept of cell-free multiple-input multiple-output in terrestrial networks, we propose a coordinated transmission scheme where multiple satellites jointly transmit spatially multiplexed data streams to each user. Using a new approximate achievable rate expression, we formulate a sum rate maximization problem under per-satellite and per-antenna power constraints and use the classical equivalence between sum rate maximization and mean square error minimization to optimize the satellites' precoding matrices using statistical channel state information. We numerically examine the performance of the proposed scheme in different settings and validate its effectiveness by comparing it against traditional precoding designs.

Title: Maximum A Posteriori Probability Channel Tracking with an Intelligent Transmitting Surface
Authors: Parisa Ramezani, Alva Kosasih, Emil Björnson
Abstract: This paper considers an intelligent transmitting surface (ITS) integrated into a base station and develops a low-overhead maximum a posteriori (MAP) probability channel tracking method for the dominant line-of-sight link between the ITS and the user equipment. We cast the per-block channel as a three-parameter model consisting of the channel amplitude, channel phase, and angle-of-arrival at the ITS. We exploit temporal correlation by updating the priors using the estimates from the previous block. Using only two pilots per coherence block alongside a targeted beam alignment strategy, the proposed method achieves precise channel tracking and attains spectral efficiency close to that achievable under perfect channel knowledge.

Title: Frequency Shaping Control for Oscillation Damping in Weakly-Connected Power Network: A Root Locus Method
Authors: Yan Jiang, Wei Chen, Zhaomin Lyu, Xunning Zhang, Dan Wang, Shinji Hara
Abstract: Frequency control following a contingency event is of vital concern in power system operations. Leveraging inverter-based resources, it is not hard to shape the center of inertia (COI) frequency nicely. However, under weak grid conditions, it becomes insufficient to solely shape the COI frequency since this aggregate signal fails to reveal the inter-area oscillations. In this manuscript, we advocate for foolproof fine-tuning rules for \emph{frequency shaping control} (FS) based on a systematic analysis of damping ratio and decay rate of inter-area oscillations to simultaneously meet specified metrics for frequency security and oscillatory stability. To this end, building on a modal decomposition, we simplify the oscillation damping problem into a pole-placement task for a set of scalar subsystems, which can be efficiently solved by only investigating the root locus of a scalar subsystem associated with the main mode, while FS inherently guarantees a Nadir-less COI frequency response. Through our proposed root-locus-based oscillatory stability analysis, we derive closed-form expressions for the minimum damping ratio and decay rate among inter-area oscillations in terms of networked system and control parameters under FS. Moreover, we propose useful tuning guidelines for FS which need only simple calculations or visualized tuning to not only shape the COI frequency into a first-order response that converges to a steady-state value within the allowed range but also ensure a satisfactory damping ratio and decay rate of inter-area oscillations following disturbances. As for the common virtual inertia control (VI), although similar oscillatory stability analysis becomes intractable, one can still glean some insights via the root locus method. Numerical simulations validate the proposed tuning for FS as well as the superiority of FS over VI in exponential convergence rate.

Title: SAM Audio Judge: A Unified Multimodal Framework for Perceptual Evaluation of Audio Separation
Authors: Helin Wang, Bowen Shi, Andros Tjandra, John Hoffman, Yi-Chiao Wu, Apoorv Vyas, Najim Dehak, Ann Lee, Wei-Ning Hsu
Abstract: The performance evaluation remains a complex challenge in audio separation, and existing evaluation metrics are often misaligned with human perception, course-grained, relying on ground truth signals. On the other hand, subjective listening tests remain the gold standard for real-world evaluation, but they are expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to scale. This paper addresses the growing need for automated systems capable of evaluating audio separation without human intervention. The proposed evaluation metric, SAM Audio Judge (SAJ), is a multimodal fine-grained reference-free objective metric, which shows highly alignment with human perceptions. SAJ supports three audio domains (speech, music and general sound events) and three prompt inputs (text, visual and span), covering four different dimensions of evaluation (recall, percision, faithfulness, and overall). SAM Audio Judge also shows potential applications in data filtering, pseudo-labeling large datasets and reranking in audio separation models. We release our code and pre-trained models at: this https URL.

Title: Interpretable and backpropagation-free Green Learning for efficient multi-task echocardiographic segmentation and classification
Authors: Jyun-Ping Kao, Jiaxing Yang, C.-C. Jay Kuo, Jonghye Woo
Abstract: Echocardiography is a cornerstone for managing heart failure (HF), with Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) being a critical metric for guiding therapy. However, manual LVEF assessment suffers from high inter-observer variability, while existing Deep Learning (DL) models are often computationally intensive and data-hungry "black boxes" that impede clinical trust and adoption. Here, we propose a backpropagation-free multi-task Green Learning (MTGL) framework that performs simultaneous Left Ventricle (LV) segmentation and LVEF classification. Our framework integrates an unsupervised VoxelHop encoder for hierarchical spatio-temporal feature extraction with a multi-level regression decoder and an XG-Boost classifier. On the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, our MTGL model achieves state-of-the-art classification and segmentation performance, attaining a classification accuracy of 94.3% and a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.912, significantly outperforming several advanced 3D DL models. Crucially, our model achieves this with over an order of magnitude fewer parameters, demonstrating exceptional computational efficiency. This work demonstrates that the GL paradigm can deliver highly accurate, efficient, and interpretable solutions for complex medical image analysis, paving the way for more sustainable and trustworthy artificial intelligence in clinical practice.

Title: Channel Estimation using 5G Sounding Reference Signals: A Delay-Doppler Domain Approach
Authors: Danilo Lelin Li, Ramtin Rabiee, Arman Farhang
Abstract: Delay-Doppler multicarrier modulation (DDMC) techniques have been among the central topics of research for high-Doppler channels. However, a complete transition to DDMC-based waveforms is not yet practically feasible. This is because 5G NR based waveforms, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and discrete Fourier transform-spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM), remain as the modulation schemes for the sixth-generation radio (6GR). Hence, in this paper, we demonstrate how we can still benefit from DD-domain processing in high-mobility scenarios using 5G NR sounding reference signals (SRSs). By considering a DFT-s-OFDM receiver, we transform each received OFDM symbol into the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, where the channel is then estimated. With this approach, we estimate the DD channel parameters, allowing us to predict the aged channel over OFDM symbols without pilots. To improve channel prediction, we propose a linear joint channel estimation and equalization technique, where we use the detected data in each OFDM symbol to sequentially update our channel estimates. Our simulation results show that the proposed technique significantly outperforms the conventional frequency-domain estimation technique in terms of bit error rate (BER) and normalized mean squared error (NMSE). Furthermore, we show that using only two slots with SRS for initial channel estimation, our method supports pilot-free detection for more than 25 subsequent OFDM symbols.

Title: Rethinking Discrete Speech Representation Tokens for Accent Generation
Authors: Jinzuomu Zhong, Yi Wang, Korin Richmond, Peter Bell
Abstract: Discrete Speech Representation Tokens (DSRTs) have become a foundational component in speech generation. While prior work has extensively studied phonetic and speaker information in DSRTs, how accent information is encoded in DSRTs remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of accent information in DSRTs. We propose a unified evaluation framework that measures both accessibility of accent information via a novel Accent ABX task and recoverability via cross-accent Voice Conversion (VC) resynthesis. Using this framework, we analyse DSRTs derived from a variety of speech encoders. Our results reveal that accent information is substantially reduced when ASR supervision is used to fine-tune the encoder, but cannot be effectively disentangled from phonetic and speaker information through naive codebook size reduction. Based on these findings, we propose new content-only and content-accent DSRTs that significantly outperform existing designs in controllable accent generation. Our work highlights the importance of accent-aware evaluation and provides practical guidance for designing DSRTs for accent-controlled speech generation.

Title: A Latent Space Framework for Modeling Transient Engine Emissions Using Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures
Authors: Ganesh Sundaram, Tobias Gehra, Jonas Ulmen, Mirjan Heubaum, Daniel Görges, Michael Günthner
Abstract: Accurately modeling and controlling vehicle exhaust emissions during transient events, such as rapid acceleration, is critical for meeting environmental regulations and optimizing powertrains. Conventional data-driven methods, such as Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, improve upon phenomenological models but often struggle with the complex nonlinear dynamics of emission formation. These monolithic architectures are sensitive to dataset variability and typically require deep, computationally expensive structures to perform well, limiting their practical utility. This paper introduces a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by modeling emission dynamics within a structured latent space. Leveraging a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), the proposed framework learns from a rich dataset that combines real-world Portable Emission Measurement System (PEMS) data with high-frequency hardware-in-the-loop measurements. The model abstracts away irrelevant noise, encoding only the key factors governing emission behavior into a compact, robust representation. This results in superior data efficiency and predictive accuracy across diverse transient regimes, significantly outperforming high-performing LSTM baselines in generalization. To ensure suitability for real-world deployment, the JEPA framework is structured to support pruning and post-training quantization. This strategy drastically reduces the computational footprint, minimizing inference time and memory demand with negligible accuracy loss. The result is a highly efficient model ideal for on-board implementation of advanced strategies, such as model predictive control or model-based reinforcement learning, in conventional and hybrid powertrains. These findings offer a clear pathway toward more robust emission control systems for next-generation vehicles.

Title: Generative Latent Alignment for Interpretable Radar Based Occupancy Detection in Ambient Assisted Living
Authors: Huy Trinh
Abstract: In this work, we study how to make mmWave radar presence detection more interpretable for Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) settings, where camera-based sensing raises privacy concerns. We propose a Generative Latent Alignment (GLA) framework that combines a lightweight convolutional variational autoencoder with a frozen CLIP text encoder to learn a low-dimensional latent representation of radar Range-Angle (RA) heatmaps. The latent space is softly aligned with two semantic anchors corresponding to "empty room" and "person present", and Grad-CAM is applied in this aligned latent space to visualize which spatial regions support each presence decision. On our mmWave radar dataset, we qualitatively observe that the "person present" class produces compact Grad-CAM blobs that coincide with strong RA returns, whereas "empty room" samples yield diffuse or no evidence. We also conduct an ablation study using unrelated text prompts, which degrades both reconstruction and localization, suggesting that radar-specific anchors are important for meaningful explanations in this setting.

Title: How Much Temporal Modeling is Enough? A Systematic Study of Hybrid CNN-RNN Architectures for Multi-Label ECG Classification
Authors: Alireza Jafari, Fatemeh Jafari
Abstract: Accurate multi-label classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals remains challenging due to the coexistence of multiple cardiac conditions, pronounced class imbalance, and long-range temporal dependencies in multi-lead recordings. Although recent studies increasingly rely on deep and stacked recurrent architectures, the necessity and clinical justification of such architectural complexity have not been rigorously examined. In this work, we perform a systematic comparative evaluation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) combined with multiple recurrent configurations, including LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and their stacked variants, for multi-label ECG classification on the PTB-XL dataset comprising 23 diagnostic categories. The CNN component serves as a morphology-driven baseline, while recurrent layers are progressively integrated to assess their contribution to temporal modeling and generalization performance. Experimental results indicate that a CNN integrated with a single BiLSTM layer achieves the most favorable trade-off between predictive performance and model complexity. This configuration attains superior Hamming loss (0.0338), macro-AUPRC (0.4715), micro-F1 score (0.6979), and subset accuracy (0.5723) compared with deeper recurrent combinations. Although stacked recurrent models occasionally improve recall for specific rare classes, our results provide empirical evidence that increasing recurrent depth yields diminishing returns and may degrade generalization due to reduced precision and overfitting. These findings suggest that architectural alignment with the intrinsic temporal structure of ECG signals, rather than increased recurrent depth, is a key determinant of robust performance and clinically relevant deployment.

Title: Analysis of Control Bellman Residual Minimization for Markov Decision Problem
Authors: Donghwan Lee, Hyukjun Yang
Abstract: Markov decision problems are most commonly solved via dynamic programming. Another approach is Bellman residual minimization, which directly minimizes the squared Bellman residual objective function. However, compared to dynamic programming, this approach has received relatively less attention, mainly because it is often less efficient in practice and can be more difficult to extend to model-free settings such as reinforcement learning. Nonetheless, Bellman residual minimization has several advantages that make it worth investigating, such as more stable convergence with function approximation for value functions. While Bellman residual methods for policy evaluation have been widely studied, methods for policy optimization (control tasks) have been scarcely explored. In this paper, we establish foundational results for the control Bellman residual minimization for policy optimization.

Title: Enhancing Speech Emotion Recognition using Dynamic Spectral Features and Kalman Smoothing
Authors: Marouane El Hizabri, Abdelfattah Bezzaz, Ismail Hayoukane, Youssef Taki
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition systems often use static features like Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR), and Root Mean Square Energy (RMSE). Because of this, they can misclassify emotions when there is acoustic noise in vocal signals. To address this, we added dynamic features using Dynamic Spectral features (Deltas and Delta-Deltas) along with the Kalman Smoothing algorithm. This approach reduces noise and improves emotion classification. Since emotion changes over time, the Kalman Smoothing filter also helped make the classifier outputs more stable. Tests on the RAVDESS dataset showed that this method achieved a state-of-the-art accuracy of 87\% and reduced misclassification between emotions with similar acoustic features

Title: A Switching Nonlinear Model Predictive Control Strategy for Safe Collision Handling by an Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator System
Authors: Ioannis G. Polyzos, Konstantinos J. Kyriakopoulos
Abstract: For active intervention tasks in underwater environments, the use of autonomous vehicles is just now emerging as an active area of research. During operation, for various reasons, the robot might find itself on a collision course with an obstacle in its environment. In this paper, a switching Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) strategy is proposed to safely handle collisions for an Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator System (UVMS). When avoiding the collision is impossible, the control algorithm takes advantage of the manipulator, using it to push against the obstacle, and deflect away from the collision. Virtual experiments are performed to demonstrate the algorithm's capability to successfully detect collisions and either avoid them, or use the manipulator to handle them appropriately without damaging sensitive areas of the vehicle.

Title: When Does Adaptation Win? Scaling Laws for Meta-Learning in Quantum Control
Authors: Nima Leclerc, Chris Miller, Nicholas Brawand
Abstract: Quantum hardware suffers from intrinsic device heterogeneity and environmental drift, forcing practitioners to choose between suboptimal non-adaptive controllers or costly per-device recalibration. We derive a scaling law lower bound for meta-learning showing that the adaptation gain (expected fidelity improvement from task-specific gradient steps) saturates exponentially with gradient steps and scales linearly with task variance, providing a quantitative criterion for when adaptation justifies its overhead. Validation on quantum gate calibration shows negligible benefits for low-variance tasks but $>40\%$ fidelity gains on two-qubit gates under extreme out-of-distribution conditions (10$\times$ the training noise), with implications for reducing per-device calibration time on cloud quantum processors. Further validation on classical linear-quadratic control confirms these laws emerge from general optimization geometry rather than quantum-specific physics. Together, these results offer a transferable framework for decision-making in adaptive control.

Title: Accelerated training of Gaussian processes using banded square exponential covariances
Authors: Emily C. Ehrhardt, Felipe Tobar
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to computationally efficient GP training based on the observation that square-exponential (SE) covariance matrices contain several off-diagonal entries extremely close to zero. We construct a principled procedure to eliminate those entries to produce a \emph{banded}-matrix approximation to the original covariance, whose inverse and determinant can be computed at a reduced computational cost, thus contributing to an efficient approximation to the likelihood function. We provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed method to preserve the structure of the original covariance in the 1D setting with SE kernel, and validate its computational efficiency against the variational free energy approach to sparse GPs.

Title: Beyond Single-Window Graph Fourier Analysis
Authors: Iulia Martina Bulai, Elena Cordero, Edoardo Pucci, Sandra Saliani
Abstract: We introduce a multi-windowed graph Fourier transform (MWGFT) for the joint vertex-frequency analysis of signals defined on graphs. Building on generalized translation and modulation induced by the graph Laplacian, the proposed framework extends the windowed graph Fourier transform by allowing multiple analysis and synthesis windows. Exact reconstruction formulas are derived for complex-valued graph signals, together with sufficient and computable conditions guaranteeing stable invertibility. The associated families of windowed graph Fourier atoms are shown to form frames for the space of graph signals. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real world graphs confirm exact reconstruction up to machine precision and demonstrate improved stability and vertex-frequency localization compared to single-window constructions, particularly on irregular graph topologies.

Title: Audio Foundation Models Outperform Symbolic Representations for Piano Performance Evaluation
Authors: Jai Dhiman
Abstract: Automated piano performance evaluation traditionally relies on symbolic (MIDI) representations, which capture note-level information but miss the acoustic nuances that characterize expressive playing. I propose using pre-trained audio foundation models, specifically MuQ and MERT, to predict 19 perceptual dimensions of piano performance quality. Using synthesized audio from PercePiano MIDI files (rendered via Pianoteq), I compare audio and symbolic approaches under controlled conditions where both derive from identical source data. The best model, MuQ layers 9-12 with Pianoteq soundfont augmentation, achieves R^2 = 0.537 (95% CI: [0.465, 0.575]), representing a 55% improvement over the symbolic baseline (R^2 = 0.347). Statistical analysis confirms significance (p < 10^-25) with audio outperforming symbolic on all 19 dimensions. I validate the approach through cross-soundfont generalization (R^2 = 0.534 +/- 0.075), difficulty correlation with an external dataset (rho = 0.623), and multi-performer consistency analysis. Analysis of audio-symbolic fusion reveals high error correlation (r = 0.738), explaining why fusion provides minimal benefit: audio representations alone are sufficient.

Title: FTA-NTN: Fairness and Throughput Assurance in Non-Terrestrial Networks
Authors: Sachin Ravikant Trankatwar, Heiko Straulino, Petar Djukic, Burak Kantarci
Abstract: Designing optimal non-terrestrial network (NTN) constellations is essential for maximizing throughput and ensuring fair resource distribution. This paper presents FTA-NTN (Fairness and Throughput Assurance in Non-Terrestrial Networks), a multi-objective optimization framework that jointly maximizes throughput and fairness under realistic system constraints. The framework integrates multi-layer Walker Delta constellations, a parametric mobility model for user distributions across Canadian land regions, adaptive K-Means clustering for beamforming and user association, and Bayesian optimization for parameter tuning. Simulation results with 500 users show that FTA-NTN achieves over 9.88 Gbps of aggregate throughput with an average fairness of 0.42, corresponding to an optimal configuration of 9 planes with 15 satellites per plane in LEO and 7 planes with 3 satellites per plane in MEO. These values align with 3GPP NTN evaluation scenarios and representative system assumptions, confirming their relevance for realistic deployments. Overall, FTA-NTN demonstrates that throughput and fairness can be jointly optimized under practical constraints, advancing beyond throughput-centric designs in the literature and offering a scalable methodology for next-generation NTN deployments that supports efficient and equitable global connectivity.

Title: A Hybrid Discriminative and Generative System for Universal Speech Enhancement
Authors: Yinghao Liu, Chengwei Liu, Xiaotao Liang, Haoyin Yan, Shaofei Xue, Zheng Xue
Abstract: Universal speech enhancement aims at handling inputs with various speech distortions and recording conditions. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid architecture that synergizes the signal fidelity of discriminative modeling with the reconstruction capabilities of generative modeling. Our system utilizes the discriminative TF-GridNet model with the Sampling-Frequency-Independent strategy to handle variable sampling rates universally. In parallel, an autoregressive model combined with spectral mapping modeling generates detail-rich speech while effectively suppressing generative artifacts. Finally, a fusion network learns adaptive weights of the two outputs under the optimization of signal-level losses and the comprehensive Speech Quality Assessment (SQA) loss. Our proposed system is evaluated in the ICASSP 2026 URGENT Challenge (Track 1) and ranks the third place.

Title: Passive Daytime Radiative Cooling Enabled by Bio-Derived Ceramic-Polymer Coatings on Rapid-Curing Fiberglass Casts
Authors: Xuguang Zhang, Hexiang Zhang, Hanqing Liu, Xiaoli Li, Mu Ying, Yutian Yang, Marilyn L. Minus, Ming Su, Yi Zheng
Abstract: Passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC) provides an energy-free approach to suppress surface temperatures by reflecting solar irradiation while emitting thermal radiation through the mid-infrared atmospheric window. Despite rapid progress in optical performance, most PDRC systems remain limited by rigid, fragile, or planar substrates, restricting their use on flexible, curved, or wearable surfaces. Here, we report a biocompatible and structurally robust PDRC system integrated onto a commercial rapid-curing fiberglass cast, a conformal substrate widely used in orthopedic and industrial applications. The cooling architecture adopts a bilayer polymer design consisting of a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) adhesion layer and a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) protective layer, both embedded with calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) ceramic particles derived from processed animal bone waste. The bio-derived CPP simultaneously enables broadband solar scattering and high mid-infrared emittance, while offering sustainability and biocompatibility advantages. The resulting composite exhibits over 90% solar reflectance and achieves up to 15 C sub-ambient cooling under direct outdoor sunlight.

Authors: Torsten Hoefler, Mikhail Khalilov, Josiah Clark, Surendra Anubolu, Mohan Kalkunte, Karen Schramm, Eric Spada, Duncan Roweth, Keith Underwood, Adrian Caulfield, Abdul Kabbani, Amirreza Rastegari
Abstract: This paper summarizes the opportunities of in-network collective operations (INC) for accelerated collective operations in AI workloads. We provide sufficient detail to make this important field accessible to non-experts in AI or networking, fostering a connection between these communities. Consider two types of INC: Edge-INC, where the system is implemented at the node level, and Core-INC, where the system is embedded within network switches. We outline the potential performance benefits as well as six key obstacles in the context of both Edge-INC and Core-INC that may hinder their adoption. Finally, we present a set of predictions for the future development and application of INC.

Title: Phase-Retrieval-Based Physics-Informed Neural Networks For Acoustic Magnitude Field Reconstruction
Authors: Karl Schrader, Shoichi Koyama, Tomohiko Nakamura, Mirco Pezzoli
Abstract: We propose a method for estimating the magnitude distribution of an acoustic field from spatially sparse magnitude measurements. Such a method is useful when phase measurements are unreliable or inaccessible. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise for sound field estimation by incorporating constraints derived from governing partial differential equations (PDEs) into neural networks. However, they do not extend to settings where phase measurements are unavailable, as the loss function based on the governing PDE relies on phase information. To remedy this, we propose a phase-retrieval-based PINN for magnitude field estimation. By representing the magnitude and phase distributions with separate networks, the PDE loss can be computed based on the reconstructed complex amplitude. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our phase-retrieval-based PINN through experimental evaluation.

Title: LightSBB-M: Bridging Schrödinger and Bass for Generative Diffusion Modeling
Authors: Alexandre Alouadi, Pierre Henry-Labordère, Grégoire Loeper, Othmane Mazhar, Huyên Pham, Nizar Touzi
Abstract: The Schrodinger Bridge and Bass (SBB) formulation, which jointly controls drift and volatility, is an established extension of the classical Schrodinger Bridge (SB). Building on this framework, we introduce LightSBB-M, an algorithm that computes the optimal SBB transport plan in only a few iterations. The method exploits a dual representation of the SBB objective to obtain analytic expressions for the optimal drift and volatility, and it incorporates a tunable parameter beta greater than zero that interpolates between pure drift (the Schrodinger Bridge) and pure volatility (Bass martingale transport). We show that LightSBB-M achieves the lowest 2-Wasserstein distance on synthetic datasets against state-of-the-art SB and diffusion baselines with up to 32 percent improvement. We also illustrate the generative capability of the framework on an unpaired image-to-image translation task (adult to child faces in FFHQ). These findings demonstrate that LightSBB-M provides a scalable, high-fidelity SBB solver that outperforms existing SB and diffusion baselines across both synthetic and real-world generative tasks.

Title: Self-Supervised Path Planning in Unstructured Environments via Global-Guided Differentiable Hard Constraint Projection
Authors: Ziqian Wang, Chenxi Fang, Zhen Zhang
Abstract: Deploying deep learning agents for autonomous navigation in unstructured environments faces critical challenges regarding safety, data scarcity, and limited computational resources. Traditional solvers often suffer from high latency, while emerging learning-based approaches struggle to ensure deterministic feasibility. To bridge the gap from embodied to embedded intelligence, we propose a self-supervised framework incorporating a differentiable hard constraint projection layer for runtime assurance. To mitigate data scarcity, we construct a Global-Guided Artificial Potential Field (G-APF), which provides dense supervision signals without manual labeling. To enforce actuator limitations and geometric constraints efficiently, we employ an adaptive neural projection layer, which iteratively rectifies the coarse network output onto the feasible manifold. Extensive benchmarks on a test set of 20,000 scenarios demonstrate an 88.75\% success rate, substantiating the enhanced operational safety. Closed-loop experiments in CARLA further validate the physical realizability of the planned paths under dynamic constraints. Furthermore, deployment verification on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX confirms an inference latency of 94 ms, showing real-time feasibility on resource-constrained embedded hardware. This framework offers a generalized paradigm for embedding physical laws into neural architectures, providing a viable direction for solving constrained optimization in mechatronics.

Title: Towards Gold-Standard Depth Estimation for Tree Branches in UAV Forestry: Benchmarking Deep Stereo Matching Methods
Authors: Yida Lin, Bing Xue, Mengjie Zhang, Sam Schofield, Richard Green
Abstract: Autonomous UAV forestry operations require robust depth estimation with strong cross-domain generalization, yet existing evaluations focus on urban and indoor scenarios, leaving a critical gap for vegetation-dense environments. We present the first systematic zero-shot evaluation of eight stereo methods spanning iterative refinement, foundation model, diffusion-based, and 3D CNN paradigms. All methods use officially released pretrained weights (trained on Scene Flow) and are evaluated on four standard benchmarks (ETH3D, KITTI 2012/2015, Middlebury) plus a novel 5,313-pair Canterbury Tree Branches dataset ($1920 \times 1080$). Results reveal scene-dependent patterns: foundation models excel on structured scenes (BridgeDepth: 0.23 px on ETH3D; DEFOM: 4.65 px on Middlebury), while iterative methods show variable cross-benchmark performance (IGEV++: 0.36 px on ETH3D but 6.77 px on Middlebury; IGEV: 0.33 px on ETH3D but 4.99 px on Middlebury). Qualitative evaluation on the Tree Branches dataset establishes DEFOM as the gold-standard baseline for vegetation depth estimation, with superior cross-domain consistency (consistently ranking 1st-2nd across benchmarks, average rank 1.75). DEFOM predictions will serve as pseudo-ground-truth for future benchmarking.

Title: GMS-CAVP: Improving Audio-Video Correspondence with Multi-Scale Contrastive and Generative Pretraining
Authors: Shentong Mo, Zehua Chen, Jun Zhu
Abstract: Recent advances in video-audio (V-A) understanding and generation have increasingly relied on joint V-A embeddings, which serve as the foundation for tasks such as cross-modal retrieval and generation. While prior methods like CAVP effectively model semantic and temporal correspondences between modalities using contrastive objectives, their performance remains suboptimal. A key limitation is the insufficient modeling of the dense, multi-scale nature of both video and audio signals, correspondences often span fine- to coarse-grained spatial-temporal structures, which are underutilized in existing frameworks. To this end, we propose GMS-CAVP, a novel framework that combines Multi-Scale Video-Audio Alignment and Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Diffusion-based pretraining objectives to enhance V-A correspondence modeling. First, GMS-CAVP introduces a multi-scale contrastive learning strategy that captures semantic and temporal relations across varying granularities. Second, we go beyond traditional contrastive learning by incorporating a diffusion-based generative objective, enabling modality translation and synthesis between video and audio. This unified discriminative-generative formulation facilitates deeper cross-modal understanding and paves the way for high-fidelity generation. Extensive experiments on VGGSound, AudioSet, and Panda70M demonstrate that GMS-CAVP outperforms previous methods in generation and retrieval.

Title: On the rarity of rocket-driven Penrose extraction in Kerr spacetime
Authors: An T. Le
Abstract: We present a Monte Carlo study of energy extraction from rotating (Kerr) black holes via the Penrose process using rocket propulsion. Through over 250,000 trajectory simulations, we establish sharp constraints on when Penrose extraction with escape to infinity succeeds. The mechanism requires that exhaust ejected inside the ergosphere carries negative Killing energy, which is kinematically accessible only via ultra-relativistic ejection deep within the ergosphere. We find that successful extraction with escape is statistically rare ($\sim$1% in broad parameter scans) and is governed by strict thresholds: it requires high black hole spin (empirically $a/M \gtrsim 0.89$) and ultra-relativistic exhaust velocity (onset at $v_e \approx 0.91c$). When conditions are highly tuned to a specific "sweet spot," success rates can reach 88.5%, representing a narrow extraction window rather than generic behavior. Furthermore, single-impulse thrust at periapsis achieves significantly higher cumulative efficiency ($\eta_{\rm cum} \approx 19\%$) compared to continuous thrust ($\sim$2--4%) due to path-averaging penalties. These constraints quantify the extreme fine-tuning required for material-based Penrose extraction, consistent with the astrophysical dominance of electromagnetic mechanisms.

Title: SCOPE: Smooth Convex Optimization for Planned Evolution of Deformable Linear Objects
Authors: Ali Jnadi, Hadi Salloum, Yaroslav Kholodov, Alexander Gasnikov, Karam Almaghout
Abstract: We present SCOPE, a fast and efficient framework for modeling and manipulating deformable linear objects (DLOs). Unlike conventional energy-based approaches, SCOPE leverages convex approximations to significantly reduce computational cost while maintaining smooth and physically plausible deformations. This trade-off between speed and accuracy makes the method particularly suitable for applications requiring real-time or near-real-time response. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through comprehensive simulation experiments, highlighting its ability to generate smooth shape trajectories under geometric and length constraints.

Title: Component-Aware Pruning Framework for Neural Network Controllers via Gradient-Based Importance Estimation
Authors: Ganesh Sundaram, Jonas Ulmen, Daniel Görges
Abstract: The transition from monolithic to multi-component neural architectures in advanced neural network controllers poses substantial challenges due to the high computational complexity of the latter. Conventional model compression techniques for complexity reduction, such as structured pruning based on norm-based metrics to estimate the relative importance of distinct parameter groups, often fail to capture functional significance. This paper introduces a component-aware pruning framework that utilizes gradient information to compute three distinct importance metrics during training: Gradient Accumulation, Fisher Information, and Bayesian Uncertainty. Experimental results with an autoencoder and a TD-MPC agent demonstrate that the proposed framework reveals critical structural dependencies and dynamic shifts in importance that static heuristics often miss, supporting more informed compression decisions.

Title: A refined nonlinear least-squares method for the rational approximation problem
Authors: Michael S. Ackermann, Linus Balicki, Serkan Gugercin, Steffen W. R. Werner
Abstract: The adaptive Antoulas-Anderson (AAA) algorithm for rational approximation is a widely used method for the efficient construction of highly accurate rational approximations to given data. While AAA can often produce rational approximations accurate to any prescribed tolerance, these approximations may have degrees larger than what is actually required to meet the given tolerance. In this work, we consider the adaptive construction of interpolating rational approximations while aiming for the smallest feasible degree to satisfy a given error tolerance. To this end, we introduce refinement approaches to the linear least-squares step of the classical AAA algorithm that aim to minimize the true nonlinear least-squares error with respect to the given data. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the derived approaches in terms of the corresponding gradients from the resulting minimization problems and use these insights to propose a new greedy framework that ensures monotonic error convergence. Numerical examples from function approximation and model order reduction verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm to construct accurate rational approximations of small degrees.

Title: An advanced 1D physics-based model for PEM hydrogen fuel cells with enhanced overvoltage prediction
Authors: Raphaël Gass (UFC, AMU), Zhongliang Li (UFC), Rachid Outbib (AMU), Samir Jemei (UFC), Daniel Hissel (UFC, IUF)
Abstract: A one-dimensional, dynamic, two-phase, isothermal model of proton exchange membrane fuel cell systems using a finite-difference approach has been developed. This model balances the simplicity of lumped-parameter models with the detailed accuracy of computational fluid dynamics models, offering precise internal state descriptions with low computational demand. The model's static behavior is validated experimentally using polarization curves. In addition, a novel physical parameter, the limit liquid water saturation coefficient ($s_{\rm lim}$), is introduced in the overvoltage calculation, replacing the traditional limit current density coefficient ($i_{\rm lim}$). This new parameter links the voltage drop at high current densities to the amount of liquid water present in the catalyst layers and the operating conditions of the fuel cell. Additionally, it has been observed that $s_{\rm lim}$ is influenced at least by the gas pressure applied by the operator. This newly established link is promising for optimizing the control and thereby improving the performance of fuel cells.

Authors: Raphaël Gass (UFC, AMU), Zhongliang Li (UFC), Rachid Outbib (AMU), Samir Jemeï (UFC), Daniel Hissel (UFC, IUF)
Abstract: The urgency of the energy transition requires improving the performance and longevity of hydrogen technologies. AlphaPEM is a dynamic one-dimensional (1D) physics-based PEM fuel cell system simulator, programmed in Python and experimentally validated. It offers a good balance between accuracy and execution speed. The modular architecture allows for addition of new features, and it has a user-friendly graphical interface. An automatic calibration method is proposed to match the model to the studied fuel cell. The software provides information on the internal states of the system in response to any current density and can produce polarization and EIS curves. AlphaPEM facilitates the use of a model in embedded conditions, allowing real-time modification of the fuel cell's operating conditions.

Title: Extensions on Low-complexity DCT Approximations for Larger Blocklengths Based on Minimal Angle Similarity
Authors: A. P. Radünz, L. Portella, R. S. Oliveira, F. M. Bayer, R. J. Cintra
Abstract: The discrete cosine transform (DCT) is a central tool for image and video coding because it can be related to the Karhunen-Loève transform (KLT), which is the optimal transform in terms of retained transform coefficients and data decorrelation. In this paper, we introduce 16-, 32-, and 64-point low-complexity DCT approximations by minimizing individually the angle between the rows of the exact DCT matrix and the matrix induced by the approximate transforms. According to some classical figures of merit, the proposed transforms outperformed the approximations for the DCT already known in the literature. Fast algorithms were also developed for the low-complexity transforms, asserting a good balance between the performance and its computational cost. Practical applications in image encoding showed the relevance of the transforms in this context. In fact, the experiments showed that the proposed transforms had better results than the known approximations in the literature for the cases of 16, 32, and 64 blocklength.

Title: Knowledge-enhanced Pretraining for Vision-language Pathology Foundation Model on Cancer Diagnosis
Authors: Xiao Zhou, Luoyi Sun, Dexuan He, Wenbin Guan, Ge Wang, Ruifen Wang, Lifeng Wang, Xiaojun Yuan, Xin Sun, Ya Zhang, Kun Sun, Yanfeng Wang, Weidi Xie
Abstract: Vision-language foundation models have shown great promise in computational pathology but remain primarily data-driven, lacking explicit integration of medical knowledge. We introduce KEEP (KnowledgE-Enhanced Pathology), a foundation model that systematically incorporates disease knowledge into pretraining for cancer diagnosis. KEEP leverages a comprehensive disease knowledge graph encompassing 11,454 diseases and 139,143 attributes to reorganize millions of pathology image-text pairs into 143,000 semantically structured groups aligned with disease ontology hierarchies. This knowledge-enhanced pretraining aligns visual and textual representations within hierarchical semantic spaces, enabling deeper understanding of disease relationships and morphological patterns. Across 18 public benchmarks (over 14,000 whole-slide images) and 4 institutional rare cancer datasets (926 cases), KEEP consistently outperformed existing foundation models, showing substantial gains for rare subtypes. These results establish knowledge-enhanced vision-language modeling as a powerful paradigm for advancing computational pathology.

Title: Why Do Speech Language Models Fail to Generate Semantically Coherent Outputs? A Modality Evolving Perspective
Authors: Hankun Wang, Haoran Wang, Yiwei Guo, Zhihan Li, Chenpeng Du, Kai Yu
Abstract: Although text-based large language models exhibit human-level writing ability and remarkable intelligence, speech language models (SLMs) still struggle to generate semantically coherent outputs. There are several potential reasons for this performance degradation: (A) speech tokens mainly provide phonetic information rather than semantic information, (B) the length of speech sequences is much longer than that of text sequences, and (C) paralinguistic information, such as prosody, introduces additional complexity and variability. In this paper, we explore the influence of three key factors separately by transiting the modality from text to speech in an evolving manner. Our findings reveal that the impact of the three factors varies. Factor A has a relatively minor impact, factor B influences syntactical and semantic modeling more obviously, and factor C exerts the most significant impact, particularly in the basic lexical modeling. Based on these findings, we provide insights into the unique challenges of training SLMs and highlight pathways to develop more effective end-to-end SLMs.

Title: Scalable Beamforming Design for Multi-RIS-Aided MU-MIMO Systems with Imperfect CSIT
Authors: Mintaek Oh, Jinseok Choi
Abstract: This paper presents a scalable beamforming design for maximizing the spectral efficiency (SE) of multi-reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided communications through joint optimization of the precoder and RIS phase shifts in multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems under imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). To address key challenges of the joint optimization problem, we first decompose it into two subproblems by deriving a proper lower bound. We then leverage a generalized power iteration (GPI) approach to identify a superior local optimal precoding solution. We further extend this approach to the RIS design using regularization; we set a RIS regularization function to efficiently handle the unit-modulus constraints, and also find the superior local optimal solution for RIS phase shifts under the GPI-based optimization framework. Subsequently, we propose an alternating optimization method. Our proposed algorithm offers scalable multi-RIS beamforming in terms of computational complexity that scales linearly with the number of RISs, while achieving superior performance. We further reduce the complexity with respect to the number of RIS elements by using diagonal approximation of the channel error covariance and avoiding direct matrix inversion. Simulations validate the proposed algorithm in terms of both the sum SE performance and the scalability.

Title: Contact Plan Design for Cross-Linked GNSSs: An ILP Approach for Extended Applications
Authors: Huan Yan, Juan A. Fraire, Ziqi Yang, Kanglian Zhao, Wenfeng Li, Xiyun Hou, Haohan Li, Yuxuan Miao, Jinjun Zheng, Chengbin Kang, Huichao Zhou, Xinuo Chang, Lu Wang
Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) employ inter-satellite links (ISLs) to reduce dependency on ground stations, enabling precise ranging and communication across satellites. Beyond their traditional role, ISLs can support extended applications, including providing navigation and communication services to external entities. However, designing effective contact plan design (CPD) schemes for these multifaceted ISLs, operating under a polling time-division duplex (PTDD) framework, remains a critical challenge. Existing CPD approaches focus solely on meeting GNSS satellites' internal ranging and communication demands, neglecting their extended applications. This paper introduces the first CPD scheme capable of supporting extended GNSS ISLs. By modeling GNSS requirements and designing a tailored service process, our approach ensures the allocation of essential resources for internal operations while accommodating external user demands. Based on the BeiDou constellation, simulation results demonstrate the proposed scheme's efficacy in maintaining core GNSS functionality while providing extended ISLs on a best-effort basis. Additionally, the results highlight the significant impact of GNSS ISLs in enhancing orbit determination and clock synchronization for the Earth-Moon libration point constellation, underscoring the importance of extended GNSS ISL applications.

Title: Secrecy Performance of a Keyhole-based Multi-user System with Multiple Eavesdroppers
Authors: Parwez Alam, Ankit Dubey, Jules M. Moualeu, Telex M. N. Ngatched, Chinmoy Kundu
Abstract: This paper investigates the secrecy performance of a keyhole-aided multi-user communication network in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. The communication happens through the same keyhole for legitimate users and eavesdroppers. In this context, the secrecy performance is evaluated for a user scheduling technique by obtaining the exact closed-form expression of secrecy outage probability (SOP). Further, a simplified asymptotic SOP expression is derived assuming high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenario for a better understanding of the impact of system parameters. The effect of the keyhole parameters, number of users, number of eavesdroppers, and threshold secrecy rate on the SOP performance are also investigated for the considered system model. In the high-SNR regime, the asymptotic SOP saturates to a constant value and does not depend on the keyhole parameter and the channel parameter of the source-to-keyhole channel.

Title: Learning Flatness-Preserving Residuals for Pure-Feedback Systems
Authors: Fengjun Yang, Jake Welde, Nikolai Matni
Abstract: We study residual dynamics learning for differentially flat systems, where a nominal model is augmented with a learned correction term from data. A key challenge is that generic residual parameterizations may destroy flatness, limiting the applicability of flatness-based planning and control methods. To address this, we propose a framework for learning flatness-preserving residual dynamics in systems whose nominal model admits a pure-feedback form. We show that residuals with a lower-triangular structure preserve both the flatness of the system and the original flat outputs. Moreover, we provide a constructive procedure to recover the flatness diffeomorphism of the augmented system from that of the nominal model. Building on these insights, we introduce a parameterization of flatness-preserving residuals using smooth function approximators, making them learnable from trajectory data with conventional algorithms. Our approach is validated in simulation on a 2D quadrotor subject to unmodeled aerodynamic effects. We demonstrate that the resulting learned flat model achieves a tracking error $5\times$ lower than the nominal flat model, while being $20\times$ faster over a structure-agnostic alternative.

Title: Fine Tuning a Simulation-Driven Estimator
Authors: Braghadeesh Lakshminarayanan, Margarita A. Guerrero, Cristian R. Rojas
Abstract: Many industries now deploy high-fidelity simulators (digital twins) to represent physical systems, yet their parameters must be calibrated to match the true system. This motivated the construction of simulation-driven parameter estimators, built by generating synthetic observations for sampled parameter values and learning a supervised mapping from observations to parameters. However, when the true parameters lie outside the sampled range, predictions suffer from an out-of-distribution (OOD) error. This paper introduces a fine-tuning approach for the Two-Stage estimator that mitigates OOD effects and improves accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through numerical simulations.

Title: Image Steganography For Securing Intellicise Wireless Networks: "Invisible Encryption" Against Eavesdroppers
Authors: Rui Meng, Song Gao, Haixiao Gao, Yinqiu Liu, Ruichen Zhang, Mengying Sun, Xiaodong Xu, Ping Zhang, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: As one of the most promising technologies for intellicise (intelligent and consice) wireless networks, Semantic Communication (SemCom) significantly improves communication efficiency by extracting, transmitting, and recovering semantic information, while reducing transmission delay. However, an integration of communication and artificial intelligence (AI) also exposes SemCom to security and privacy threats posed by intelligent eavesdroppers. To address this challenge, image steganography in SemCom embeds secret semantic features within cover semantic features, allowing intelligent eavesdroppers to decode only the cover image. This technique offers a form of "invisible encryption" for SemCom. Motivated by these advancements, this paper conducts a comprehensive exploration of integrating image steganography into SemCom. Firstly, we review existing encryption techniques in SemCom and assess the potential of image steganography in enhancing its security. Secondly, we delve into various image steganographic paradigms designed to secure SemCom, encompassing three categories of joint source-channel coding (JSCC) models tailored for image steganography SemCom, along with multiple training strategies. Thirdly, we present a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of coverless steganography SemCom. Finally, we propose future research directions for image steganography SemCom.

Title: EDM2SE: A Magnitude-Preserving Network Architecture for Diffusion-Based Speech Enhancement
Authors: Julius Richter, Danilo de Oliveira, Timo Gerkmann
Abstract: We study diffusion-based speech enhancement using a Schrodinger bridge formulation and extend the EDM2 framework to this setting. We employ time-dependent preconditioning of network inputs and outputs to stabilize training and explore two skip-connection configurations that allow the network to predict either environmental noise or clean speech. To control activation and weight magnitudes, we adopt a magnitude-preserving architecture and learn the contribution of the noisy input within each network block for improved conditioning. We further analyze the impact of exponential moving average (EMA) parameter smoothing by approximating different EMA profiles post training, finding that, unlike in image generation, short or absent EMA consistently yields better speech enhancement performance. Experiments on VoiceBank-DEMAND and EARS-WHAM demonstrate competitive signal-to-distortion ratios and perceptual scores, with the two skip-connection variants exhibiting complementary strengths. These findings provide new insights into EMA behavior, magnitude preservation, and skip-connection design for diffusion-based speech enhancement.

Title: Attention-Aided MMSE for OFDM Channel Estimation: Learning Linear Filters with Attention
Authors: TaeJun Ha, Chaehyun Jung, Hyeonuk Kim, Jeongwoo Park, Jeonghun Park
Abstract: In orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), accurate channel estimation is crucial. Classical signal processing-based approaches, such as linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) estimation, often require second-order statistics that are difficult to obtain in practice. Recent deep neural network (DNN)-based methods have been introduced to address this; yet they often suffer from high inference complexity. This paper proposes an Attention-aided MMSE (A-MMSE), a model-based DNN framework that learns the linear MMSE filter via the Attention Transformer. Once trained, the A-MMSE performs channel estimation through a single linear operation, eliminating nonlinear activations during inference and thus reducing computational complexity. To improve the learning efficiency of the A-MMSE, we develop a two-stage Attention encoder that captures the frequency and temporal correlation structure of OFDM channels. We also introduce a rank-adaptive extension that enables a flexible performance-complexity trade-off. Numerical simulations show that the proposed A-MMSE consistently outperforms other baseline methods in terms of normalized MSE across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. In particular, the A-MMSE and its rank-adaptive extension provide an improved performance-complexity trade-off, providing a powerful and highly efficient solution for practical channel estimation.

Title: Confidence intervals for forced alignment boundaries using model ensembles
Authors: Matthew C. Kelley
Abstract: Forced alignment is a common tool to align audio with orthographic and phonetic transcriptions. Most forced alignment tools provide only a single estimate of a boundary. The present project introduces a method of deriving confidence intervals for these boundaries using a neural network ensemble technique. Ten different segment classifier neural networks were previously trained, and the alignment process is repeated with each model. The alignment ensemble is then used to place the boundary at the median of the boundaries in the ensemble, and 97.85% confidence intervals are constructed using order statistics. Having confidence intervals provides an estimate of the uncertainty in the boundary placement, facilitating tasks like finding boundaries that should be reviewed. As a bonus, on the Buckeye and TIMIT corpora, the ensemble boundaries show a slight overall improvement over using just a single model. The confidence intervals can be emitted during the alignment process as JSON files and a main table for programmatic and statistical analysis. For familiarity, they are also output as Praat TextGrids using a point tier to represent the intervals.

Title: DPLib: A Standard Benchmark Library for Distributed Power System Analysis and Optimization
Authors: Milad Hasanzadeh, Amin Kargarian
Abstract: \textit{DPLib} is an open-source MATLAB-based benchmark library created to support research and development in distributed and decentralized power system analysis and optimization. Distributed and decentralized methods offer scalability, privacy preservation, and resilience to single points of failure, making them increasingly important for modern power systems. However, unlike centralized tools such as MATPOWER, no general-purpose, reproducible data library package currently exists for distributed power system studies. DPLib, available at \href{this https URL}{GitHub}, fills this gap by providing a standard power system library featuring over 20 multi-region benchmark test cases of varying sizes, along with a graph-based partitioning toolkit that decomposes any MATPOWER test system into multiple electrically coherent regions. The partitioning toolkit, an easy-to-use MATLAB code, generates standardized \texttt{.mat} and \texttt{.m} files, along with region visualizations for intuitive understanding. We also provide modular, easy-to-use distributed optimal power flow (OPF) solvers: an alternating direction method of multipliers(ADMM)-based DC-OPF solver implemented in YALMIP, and an ADMM-based AC-OPF solver leveraging IPOPT. These solvers validate the generated test systems for distributed optimization applications. Numerical results validate the generated test cases, establishing DPLib as a foundation for reproducible distributed power system research.

Title: Revisiting Z Transform Laplace Inversion: To Correct flaws in Signal and System Theory
Authors: Yuxin Yang, Hang Zhou, Chaojie Li, Xin Li, Yingyi Yan, Mingyang Zheng
Abstract: This paper revisits the classical formulation of the Z-transform and its relationship to the inverse Laplace transform (L-1), originally developed by Ragazzini in sampled-data theory. It identifies a longstanding mathematical oversight in standard derivations, which typically neglect the contribution from the infinite arc in the complex plane during inverse Laplace evaluation. This omission leads to inconsistencies, especially at discontinuities such as t = 0. By incorporating the full Bromwich contour, including all boundary contributions, we restore internal consistency between L-1 and the Z-transform, aligning the corrected L-1 with results from Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) aliasing theory. Consequently, this necessitates a structural revision of the Z-transform, inverse Laplace transform, and the behavior of the Heaviside step function at discontinuities, providing a more accurate foundation for modeling and analysis of sampled-data systems.

Title: Context-Aware Deep Learning for Robust Channel Extrapolation in Fluid Antenna Systems
Authors: Yanliang Jin, Runze Yu, Yuan Gao, Shengli Liu, Xiaoli Chu, Kai-Kit Wong, Chan-Byoung Chae
Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) offer remarkable spatial flexibility but face significant challenges in acquiring high-resolution channel state information (CSI), leading to considerable overhead. To address this issue, we propose CANet, a robust deep learning model for channel extrapolation in FAS. CANet combines context-adaptive modeling with a cross-scale attention mechanism and is built on a ConvNeXt v2 backbone to improve extrapolation accuracy for unobserved antenna ports. To further enhance robustness, we introduce a novel spatial amplitude perturbation strategy, inspired by frequency-domain augmentation techniques in image processing. This motivates the incorporation of a Fourier-domain loss function, capturing frequency-domain consistency, alongside a spectral structure consistency loss that reinforces learning stability under perturbations. Our simulation results demonstrate that CANet outperforms benchmark models across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels.

Title: Monotone Neural Barrier Certificates
Authors: Saber Jafarpour, Alireza Nadali, Ashutosh Trivedi, Majid Zamani
Abstract: This report presents a neurosymbolic framework for safety verification and control synthesis in high-dimensional monotone dynamical systems without relying on explicit models or conservative Lipschitz bounds. The approach combines the expressiveness of neural networks with the rigor of symbolic reasoning via barrier certificates, functional analogs of inductive invariants that formally guarantee safety. Prior data-driven methods often treat dynamics as black-box models, relying on dense state-space discretization or Lipschitz overapproximations, leading to exponential sample complexity. In contrast, monotonicity--a pervasive structural property in many real-world systems--provides a symbolic scaffold that simplifies both learning and verification. Exploiting order preservation reduces verification to localized boundary checks, transforming a high-dimensional problem into a tractable, low-dimensional one. Barrier certificates are synthesized using monotone neural network architectures with embedded monotonicity constraints--trained via gradient-based optimization guided by barrier conditions. This enables scalable, formally sound verification directly from simulation data, bridging black-box learning and formal guarantees within a unified neurosymbolic framework.

Title: Ruggedized Ultrasound Sensing in Harsh Conditions: eRTIS in the wild
Authors: Dennis Laurijssen, Wouter Jansen, Arne Aerts, Walter Daems, Jan Steckel
Abstract: We present eRTIS, a rugged, embedded ultrasound sensing system for use in harsh industrial environments. The system features a broadband capacitive transducer and a 32-element MEMS microphone array capable of 2D and 3D beamforming. A modular hardware architecture separates sensing and processing tasks: a high-performance microcontroller handles excitation signal generation and data acquisition, while an NVIDIA Jetson module performs GPU-accelerated signal processing. eRTIS supports external synchronization via a custom controller that powers and coordinates up to six devices, either simultaneously or in a defined sequence. Additional synchronization options include bidirectional triggering and in-band signal injection. A sealed, anodized aluminum enclosure with passive cooling and IP-rated connectors ensures reliability in challenging conditions. Performance is demonstrated in three field scenarios: harbor mooring, off-road robotics, and autonomous navigation in cluttered environments, demonstrates that eRTIS provides robust sensing in situations where optical systems degrade.

Title: Hint: hierarchical inter-frame correlation for one-shot point cloud sequence compression
Authors: Yuchen Gao, Qi Zhang
Abstract: Deep learning has demonstrated strong capability in compressing point clouds. Within this area, entropy modeling for lossless compression is widely investigated. However, most methods rely solely on parent/sibling contexts and level-wise autoregression, which suffers from decoding latency on the order of 10^1-10^2 seconds. We propose HINT, a method that integrates temporal and spatial correlation for sequential point cloud compression. Specifically, it first uses a two-stage temporal feature extraction: (i) a parent-level existence map and (ii) a child-level neighborhood lookup in the previous frame. These cues are fused with the spatial features via element-wise addition and encoded with a group-wise strategy. Experimental results show that HINT achieves encoding and decoding time at 105 ms and 140 ms, respectively, equivalent to 49.6x and 21.6x acceleration in comparison with G-PCC, while achieving up to 43.6% bitrate reduction and consistently outperforming the spatial-only baseline (RENO).

Title: Transfer Learning for Paediatric Sleep Apnoea Detection Using Physiology-Guided Acoustic Models
Authors: Chaoyue Niu, Veronica Rowe, Guy J. Brown, Heather Elphick, Heather Kenyon, Lowri Thomas, Sam Johnson, Ning Ma
Abstract: Paediatric obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is clinically significant yet difficult to diagnose, as children poorly tolerate sensor-based polysomnography. Acoustic monitoring provides a non-invasive alternative for home-based OSA screening, but limited paediatric data hinders the development of robust deep learning approaches. This paper proposes a transfer learning framework that adapts acoustic models pretrained on adult sleep data to paediatric OSA detection, incorporating SpO2-based desaturation patterns to enhance model training. Using a large adult sleep dataset (157 nights) and a smaller paediatric dataset (15 nights), we systematically evaluate (i) single- versus multi-task learning, (ii) encoder freezing versus full fine-tuning, and (iii) the impact of delaying SpO2 labels to better align them with the acoustics and capture physiologically meaningful features. Results show that fine-tuning with SpO2 integration consistently improves paediatric OSA detection compared with baseline models without adaptation. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of transfer learning for home-based OSA screening in children and offer its potential clinical value for early diagnosis.

Title: SoundCompass: Navigating Target Sound Extraction With Effective Directional Clue Integration In Complex Acoustic Scenes
Authors: Dayun Choi, Jung-Woo Choi
Abstract: Recent advances in target sound extraction (TSE) utilize directional clues derived from direction of arrival (DoA), which represent an inherent spatial property of sound available in any acoustic scene. However, previous DoA-based methods rely on hand-crafted features or discrete encodings, which lose fine-grained spatial information and limit adaptability. We propose SoundCompass, an effective directional clue integration framework centered on a Spectral Pairwise INteraction (SPIN) module that captures cross-channel spatial correlations in the complex spectrogram domain to preserve full spatial information in multichannel signals. The input feature expressed in terms of spatial correlations is fused with a DoA clue represented as spherical harmonics (SH) encoding. The fusion is carried out across overlapping frequency subbands, inheriting the benefits reported in the previous band-split architectures. We also incorporate the iterative refinement strategy, chain-of-inference (CoI), in the TSE framework, which recursively fuses DoA with sound event activation estimated from the previous inference stage. Experiments demonstrate that SoundCompass, combining SPIN, SH embedding, and CoI, robustly extracts target sources across diverse signal classes and spatial configurations.

Title: Short-Segment Speaker Verification with Pre-trained Models and Multi-Resolution Encoder
Authors: Jisoo Myoung, Sangwook Han, Kihyuk Kim, Jong Won Shin
Abstract: Speaker verification (SV) utilizing features obtained from models pre-trained via self-supervised learning has recently demonstrated impressive performances. However, these pre-trained models (PTMs) usually have a temporal resolution of 20 ms, which is lower than typical filterbank features. It may be problematic especially for short-segment SV with an input segment shorter than 2 s, in which we need to extract as much information as possible from the input with a limited length. Although there have been approaches to utilize multi-resolution features from the HuBERT models, the window shifts were 20, 40, and 100 ms when the sampling rate was 16 kHz and thus only lower resolution features were considered. In this study, we propose an SV system which utilizes PTM features along with filterbank features and those from the multi-resolution time domain encoder with window shifts of 1.56, 3.13, 6.25, and 12.5 ms. Experimental results on the VoxCeleb dataset with various input lengths showed consistent improvements over systems with various combinations of input features.

Title: Hill-Type Stability Analysis of Periodic Solutions of Fractional-Order Differential Equations
Authors: Paul-Erik Haacker, Remco I. Leine, Renu Chaudhary, Kai Diethelm, André Schmidt, Safoura Hashemishahraki
Abstract: This paper explores stability properties of periodic solutions of (nonlinear) fractional-order differential equations (FODEs). As classical Caputo-type FODEs do not admit exactly periodic solutions, we propose a framework of Liouville-Weyl-type FODEs, which do admit exactly periodic solutions and are an extension of Caputo-type FODEs. Local linearization around a periodic solution results in perturbation dynamics governed by a linear time-periodic differential equation. In the classical integer-order case, the perturbation dynamics is therefore described by Floquet theory, i.e. the exponential growth or decay of perturbations is expressed by Floquet exponents which can be assessed using the Hill matrix approach. For fractional-order systems, however, a rigorous Floquet theory is lacking. Here, we explore the limitations when trying to extend Floquet theory and the Hill matrix method to linear time-periodic fractional-order differential equations (LTP-FODEs) as local linearization of nonlinear fractional-order systems. A key result of the paper is that such an extended Floquet theory can only assess exponentially growing solutions of LTP-FODEs. Moreover, we provide an analysis of linear time-invariant fractional-order systems (LTI-FODEs) with algebraically decaying solutions and show that the inaccessibility of decaying solutions through Floquet theory is already present in the time-invariant case.

Title: Unsupervised lexicon learning from speech is limited by representations rather than clustering
Authors: Danel Slabbert, Simon Malan, Herman Kamper
Abstract: Zero-resource word segmentation and clustering systems aim to tokenise speech into word-like units without access to text labels. Despite progress, the induced lexicons are still far from perfect. In an idealised setting with gold word boundaries, we ask whether performance is limited by the representation of word segments, or by the clustering methods that group them into word-like types. We combine a range of self-supervised speech features (continuous/discrete, frame/word-level) with different clustering methods (K-means, hierarchical, graph-based) on English and Mandarin data. The best system uses graph clustering with dynamic time warping on continuous features. Faster alternatives use graph clustering with cosine distance on averaged continuous features or edit distance on discrete unit sequences. Through controlled experiments that isolate either the representations or the clustering method, we demonstrate that representation variability across segments of the same word type -- rather than clustering -- is the primary factor limiting performance.

Title: HYPERDOA: Robust and Efficient DoA Estimation using Hyperdimensional Computing
Authors: Rajat Bhattacharjya, Woohyeok Park, Arnab Sarkar, Hyunwoo Oh, Mohsen Imani, Nikil Dutt
Abstract: Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation techniques face a critical trade-off, as classical methods often lack accuracy in challenging, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, while modern deep learning approaches are too energy-intensive and opaque for resource-constrained, safety-critical systems. We introduce HYPERDOA, a novel estimator leveraging Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC). The framework introduces two distinct feature extraction strategies -- Mean Spatial-Lag Autocorrelation and Spatial Smoothing -- for its HDC pipeline, and then reframes DoA estimation as a pattern recognition problem. This approach leverages HDC's inherent robustness to noise and its transparent algebraic operations to bypass the expensive matrix decompositions and "black-box" nature of classical and deep learning methods, respectively. Our evaluation demonstrates that HYPERDOA achieves ~35.39% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods in low-SNR, coherent-source scenarios. Crucially, it also consumes ~93% less energy than competing neural baselines on an embedded NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX platform. This dual advantage in accuracy and efficiency establishes HYPERDOA as a robust and viable solution for mission-critical applications on edge devices.

Title: Dynamically Slimmable Speech Enhancement Network with Metric-Guided Training
Authors: Haixin Zhao, Kaixuan Yang, Nilesh Madhu
Abstract: To further reduce the complexity of lightweight speech enhancement models, we introduce a gating-based Dynamically Slimmable Network (DSN). The DSN comprises static and dynamic components. For architecture-independent applicability, we introduce distinct dynamic structures targeting the commonly used components, namely, grouped recurrent neural network units, multi-head attention, convolutional, and fully connected layers. A policy module adaptively governs the use of dynamic parts at a frame-wise resolution according to the input signal quality, controlling computational load. We further propose Metric-Guided Training (MGT) to explicitly guide the policy module in assessing input speech quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the DSN achieves comparable enhancement performance in instrumental metrics to the state-of-the-art lightweight baseline, while using only 73% of its computational load on average. Evaluations of dynamic component usage ratios indicate that the MGT-DSN can appropriately allocate network resources according to the severity of input signal distortion.

Abstract: We demonstrate a record-high 62.6 GHz solidly mounted acoustic resonator (SMR) incorporating a 67.6 nm scandium aluminum nitride (Sc0.3Al0.7N) piezoelectric layer on a 40 nm buried platinum (Pt) bottom electrode, positioned above an acoustic Bragg reflector composed of alternating SiO2 (28.2 nm) and Ta2O5 (24.3 nm) layers in 8.5 pairs. The Bragg reflector and piezoelectric stack above are designed to confine a third-order thickness-extensional (TE) bulk acoustic wave (BAW) mode, while efficiently transducing with thickness-field excitation. The fabricated SMR exhibits an extracted piezoelectric coupling coefficient (k2) of 0.8% and a maximum Bode quality factor (Q) of 51 at 63 GHz, representing the highest operating frequency reported for an SMR to date. These results establish a pathway toward mmWave SMR devices for filters and resonators in next-generation RF front ends.

Title: Empowering Multimodal Respiratory Sound Classification with Counterfactual Adversarial Debiasing for Out-of-Distribution Robustness
Authors: Heejoon Koo, Miika Toikkanen, Yoon Tae Kim, Soo Yong Kim, June-Woo Kim
Abstract: Multimodal respiratory sound classification offers promise for early pulmonary disease detection by integrating bioacoustic signals with patient metadata. Nevertheless, current approaches remain vulnerable to spurious correlations from attributes such as age, sex, or acquisition device, which hinder their generalization, especially under distribution shifts across clinical sites. To this end, we propose a counterfactual adversarial debiasing framework. First, we employ a causal graph-based counterfactual debiasing methodology to suppress non-causal dependencies from patient metadata. Second, we introduce adversarial debiasing to learn metadata-insensitive representations and reduce metadata-specific biases. Third, we design counterfactual metadata augmentation to mitigate spurious correlations further and strengthen metadata-invariant representations. By doing so, our method consistently outperforms strong baselines in evaluations under both in-distribution and distribution shifts. Code is available at this https URL.

Title: Mitigating Attention Sinks and Massive Activations in Audio-Visual Speech Recognition with LLMs
Authors: Anand, Umberto Cappellazzo, Stavros Petridis, Maja Pantic
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently advanced auditory speech recognition (ASR), visual speech recognition (VSR), and audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR). However, understanding of their internal dynamics under fine-tuning remains limited. In natural language processing, recent work has revealed attention sinks, tokens that attract disproportionately high attention, and associated massive activations in which some features of sink tokens exhibit huge activation in LLMs. In this work, we are the first to study these phenomena in multimodal speech recognition. Through a detailed analysis of audio-visual LLMs, we identify attention sinks and massive activations not only at the BOS token but also at intermediate low-semantic tokens across ASR, VSR, and AVSR. We show that massive activations originate in the MLP layers and correspond to fixed feature indices across all sink tokens. We further show that intermediate sink tokens exhibit high cosine similarity to the BOS token, thereby amplifying attention and activation. Building on these insights, we introduce a simple decorrelation loss that reduces cosine similarity between BOS and other tokens, effectively mitigating intermediate sinks and massive activations. Furthermore, our method improves word error rate (WER) under high audio-visual feature downsampling while remaining stable at lower downsampling rates.

Title: Omni-AVSR: Towards Unified Multimodal Speech Recognition with Large Language Models
Authors: Umberto Cappellazzo, Xubo Liu, Pingchuan Ma, Stavros Petridis, Maja Pantic
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved impressive results in speech recognition across multiple modalities, including Auditory Speech Recognition (ASR), Visual Speech Recognition (VSR), and Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR). Despite this progress, current LLM-based approaches typically address each task independently, training separate models that raise computational and deployment resource use while missing potential cross-task synergies. They also rely on fixed-rate token compression, which restricts flexibility in balancing accuracy with efficiency. These limitations highlight the need for a unified framework that can support ASR, VSR, and AVSR while enabling elastic inference. To this end, we present Omni-AVSR, a unified audio-visual LLM that combines efficient multi-granularity training with parameter-efficient adaptation. Specifically, we adapt the matryoshka representation learning paradigm to efficiently train across multiple audio and visual granularities, reducing its inherent training resource use. Furthermore, we explore three LoRA-based strategies for adapting the backbone LLM, balancing shared and task-specific specialization. Experiments on LRS2 and LRS3 show that Omni-AVSR achieves comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art baselines while training a single model at substantially lower training and deployment resource use. The model also remains robust under acoustic noise, and we analyze its scaling behavior as LLM size increases, providing insights into the trade-off between performance and efficiency.

Title: Delay-Multiply-And-Sum Beamforming for Real-Time In-Air Acoustic Imaging
Authors: Wouter Jansen, Walter Daems, Jan Steckel
Abstract: In-air acoustic imaging systems demand beamforming techniques that offer a high dynamic range and spatial resolution while also remaining robust. Conventional Delay-and-Sum (DAS) beamforming fails to meet these quality demands due to high sidelobes, a wide main lobe and the resulting low contrast, whereas advanced adaptive methods are typically precluded by the computational cost and the single-snapshot constraint of real-time field operation. To overcome this trade-off, we propose and detail the implementation of higher-order non-linear beamforming methods using the Delay-Multiply-and-Sum technique, coupled with Coherence Factor weighting, specifically adapted for ultrasonic in-air microphone arrays. Our efficient implementation allows for enabling GPU-accelerated, real-time performance on embedded computing platforms. Through validation against the DAS baseline using simulated and real-world acoustic data, we demonstrate that the proposed method provides significant improvements in image contrast, establishing higher-order non-linear beamforming as a practical, high-performance solution for in-air acoustic imaging.

Title: Autonomous Navigation and Station-Keeping on Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbits
Authors: Yuri Shimane, Karl Berntorp, Stefano Di Cairano, Avishai Weiss
Abstract: This article develops an optical navigation (OPNAV) and station-keeping pipeline for the near-rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO) in high-fidelity ephemeris model dynamics, using synthetic images in a non-iterative horizon-based OPNAV algorithm, applying the result in a navigation filter, and using the obtained estimates in a station-keeping control scheme that keeps the spacecraft in the vicinity of a reference orbit. We study differential correction-based and minimization-based implementations of the so-called x-axis crossing control scheme, and propose an improved targeting prediction scheme by incorporating the filter's state covariance with an unscented transform. We also introduce a hysteresis mechanism, which improves station-keeping cost and provides insight into the difference in performance between the differential correction-based and minimization-based approaches. We perform Monte-Carlo experiments to assess the pipeline's tracking and {\Delta}V performances. We report several key findings, including the variability of the filter performance with the sensor field of view and measurement locations, station-keeping cost reduction achieved by the unscented transform-based prediction and hysteresis, as well as the variability of the cumulative {\Delta}V as a function of maneuver location due to the periodic structure in the OPNAV-based filter's estimation accuracy.

Title: An Energy-Efficient Adiabatic Capacitive Neural Network Chip
Authors: Himadri Singh Raghav, Sachin Maheshwari, Mike Smart, Patrick Foster, Alex Serb
Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence, coupled with increasing data bandwidth requirements, in applications such as video processing and high-resolution sensing, have created a growing demand for high computational performance under stringent energy constraints, especially for battery-powered and edge devices. To address this, we present a mixed-signal adiabatic capacitive neural network chip, designed in a 130$nm$ CMOS technology, to demonstrate significant energy savings coupled with high image classification accuracy. Our dual-layer hardware chip, incorporating 16 single-cycle multiply-accumulate engines, can reliably distinguish between 4 classes of 8x8 1-bit images, with classification results over 95\%, within 2.7\% of an equivalent software version. Energy measurements reveal average energy savings between 2.1x and 6.8x, compared to an equivalent CMOS capacitive implementation.

Title: Simultaneous Source Separation, Synchronization, Localization and Mapping for 6G Systems
Authors: Alexander Venus, Erik Leitinger, Klaus Witrisal
Abstract: Multipath-based simultaneous localization and mapping (MP-SLAM) is a promising approach for future 6G networks to jointly estimate the positions of transmitters and receivers together with the propagation environment. In cooperative MP-SLAM, information collected by multiple mobile-terminals (MTs) is fused to enhance accuracy and robustness. Existing methods, however, typically assume perfectly synchronized base stations (BSs) and orthogonal transmission sequences, rendering inter-BS interference at the MT negligible. In this work, we relax these assumptions and address simultaneous source separation, synchronization, and mapping. A relevant example arises in modern 5G systems, where BSs employ muting patterns to mitigate interference, yet localization performance still degrades. We propose a novel BS-dependent data association and synchronization bias model, integrated into a joint Bayesian framework and inferred via the sum-product algorithm on a factor graph. The impact of joint synchronization and source separation is analyzed under various system configurations. Compared with state-of-the-art cooperative MP-SLAM assuming orthogonal and synchronized BSs, our statistical analysis shows no significant performance degradation. The proposed BS-dependent data association model constitutes a principled approach for classifying features by arbitrary properties that persist over time, such as reflection order or feature type (scatter points versus walls).

Title: Delay-Aware Task Offloading for Heterogeneous VLC-RF-based Vehicular Fog Computing
Authors: Nan An, Hongyi He, Fang Yang, Chang Liu, Jian Song, Zhu Han, Binbin Zhu
Abstract: Vehicular fog computing (VFC) is a promising paradigm for reducing the computation burden of vehicles, thus supporting delay-sensitive services in next-generation transportation networks. However, traditional VFC schemes rely on radio frequency (RF) communications, which limits their adaptability for dense vehicular environments. In this paper, a heterogeneous visible light communication (VLC)-RF architecture is designed for VFC systems to facilitate efficient task offloading. Specifically, computing tasks are dynamically partitioned and offloaded to idle vehicles via both VLC and RF links, thereby fully exploiting the interference resilience of VLC and the coverage advantage of RF. To minimize the average task processing delay (TPD), an optimization problem of task offloading and computing resource allocation is formulated, and then solved by the developed residual-based majorization-minimization (RBMM) algorithm. Simulation results confirm that the heterogeneous VLC-RF architecture with the proposed algorithm achieves a 15% average TPD reduction compared to VFC systems relying solely on VLC or RF.

Title: Stream-Voice-Anon: Enhancing Utility of Real-Time Speaker Anonymization via Neural Audio Codec and Language Models
Authors: Nikita Kuzmin, Songting Liu, Kong Aik Lee, Eng Siong Chng
Abstract: Protecting speaker identity is crucial for online voice applications, yet streaming speaker anonymization (SA) remains underexplored. Recent research has demonstrated that neural audio codec (NAC) provides superior speaker feature disentanglement and linguistic fidelity. NAC can also be used with causal language models (LM) to enhance linguistic fidelity and prompt control for streaming tasks. However, existing NAC-based online LM systems are designed for voice conversion (VC) rather than anonymization, lacking the techniques required for privacy protection. Building on these advances, we present Stream-Voice-Anon, which adapts modern causal LM-based NAC architectures specifically for streaming SA by integrating anonymization techniques. Our anonymization approach incorporates pseudo-speaker representation sampling, a speaker embedding mixing and diverse prompt selection strategies for LM conditioning that leverage the disentanglement properties of quantized content codes to prevent speaker information leakage. Additionally, we compare dynamic and fixed delay configurations to explore latency-privacy trade-offs in real-time scenarios. Under the VoicePrivacy 2024 Challenge protocol, Stream-Voice-Anon achieves substantial improvements in intelligibility (up to 46% relative WER reduction) and emotion preservation (up to 28% UAR relative) compared to the previous state-of-the-art streaming method DarkStream while maintaining comparable latency (180ms vs 200ms) and privacy protection against lazy-informed attackers, though showing 15% relative degradation against semi-informed attackers.

Title: Q-Probe: Scaling Image Quality Assessment to High Resolution via Context-Aware Agentic Probing
Authors: Xiang Li, XueHeng Li, Yu Wang, XuanHua He, ZhangChi Hu, WeiWei Yu, ChengJun Xie
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empowered Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to achieve superior human preference alignment in Image Quality Assessment (IQA). However, existing RL-based IQA models typically rely on coarse-grained global views, failing to capture subtle local degradations in high-resolution scenarios. While emerging "Thinking with Images" paradigms enable multi-scale visual perception via zoom-in mechanisms, their direct adaptation to IQA induces spurious "cropping-implies-degradation" biases and misinterprets natural depth-of-field as artifacts. To address these challenges, we propose Q-Probe, the first agentic IQA framework designed to scale IQA to high resolution via context-aware probing. First, we construct Vista-Bench, a pioneering benchmark tailored for fine-grained local degradation analysis in high-resolution IQA settings. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage training paradigm that progressively aligns the model with human preferences, while simultaneously eliminating causal bias through a novel context-aware cropping strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Probe achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-resolution settings while maintaining superior efficacy across resolution scales.

Title: Cloud and AI Infrastructure Cost Optimization: A Comprehensive Review of Strategies and Case Studies
Authors: Saurabh Deochake
Abstract: Cloud computing has revolutionized the way organizations manage their IT infrastructure, but it has also introduced new challenges, such as managing cloud costs. The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) workloads has further amplified these challenges, with GPU compute now representing 40-60\% of technical budgets for AI-focused organizations. This paper provides a comprehensive review of cloud and AI infrastructure cost optimization techniques, covering traditional cloud pricing models, resource allocation strategies, and emerging approaches for managing AI/ML workloads. We examine the dramatic cost reductions in large language model (LLM) inference which has decreased by approximately 10x annually since 2021 and explore techniques such as model quantization, GPU instance selection, and inference optimization. Real-world case studies from Amazon Prime Video, Pinterest, Cloudflare, and Netflix showcase practical application of these techniques. Our analysis reveals that organizations can achieve 50-90% cost savings through strategic optimization approaches. Future research directions in automated optimization, sustainability, and AI-specific cost management are proposed to advance the state of the art in this rapidly evolving field.

Title: Time-Constrained Erasure Correction for Data Recovery in UAV-Aided IoT
Authors: Kushwanth Sistu, Siddhartha S. Borkotoky
Abstract: We propose data-recovery schemes to improve the uplink reliability of Internet of Things (IoT) networks in which a gateway mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) collects data from sensor nodes on the ground. The proposed techniques employ fountain coding and message replication to correct frame erasures on the sensor-to-UAV links. A salient feature of the proposed schemes is their adaptive selection of the redundancy amount depending on the contact times between a sensor and the UAV. We illustrate our design philosophy for the special case of a network in which wake-up radios (WuRs) are used for activating the sensors upon the UAV's arrival, and the sensor-to-UAV data transfer employs the Long Range (LoRa) communication technology with random access.

Title: Robust Instance Optimal Phase-Only Compressed Sensing
Authors: Junren Chen, Michael K. Ng, Jonathan Scarlett
Abstract: Phase-only compressed sensing (PO-CS) concerns the recovery of sparse signals from the phases of complex measurements. Recent results show that sparse signals in the standard sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ can be exactly recovered from complex Gaussian phases by a linearization procedure, which recasts PO-CS as linear compressed sensing and then applies (quadratically constrained) basis pursuit to obtain $\mathbf{x}^\sharp$. This paper focuses on the instance optimality and robustness of $\mathbf{x}^{\sharp}$. First, we strengthen the nonuniform instance optimality of Jacques and Feuillen (2021) to a uniform one over the entire signal space. We show the existence of some universal constant $C$ such that $\|\mathbf{x}^\sharp-\mathbf{x}\|_2\le Cs^{-1/2}\sigma_{\ell_1}(\mathbf{x},\Sigma^n_s)$ holds for all $\mathbf{x}$ in the unit Euclidean sphere, where $\sigma_{\ell_1}(\mathbf{x},\Sigma^n_s)$ is the $\ell_1$ distance of $\mathbf{x}$ to its closest $s$-sparse signal. This is achieved by showing the new sensing matrices corresponding to all approximately sparse signals simultaneously satisfy RIP. Second, we investigate the estimator's robustness to noise and corruption. We show that dense noise with entries bounded by some small $\tau_0$, appearing either prior or posterior to retaining the phases, increments $\|\mathbf{x}^\sharp-\mathbf{x}\|_2$ by $O(\tau_0)$. This is near-optimal (up to log factors) for any algorithm. On the other hand, adversarial corruption, which changes an arbitrary $\zeta_0$-fraction of the measurements to any phase-only values, increments $\|\mathbf{x}^\sharp-\mathbf{x}\|_2$ by $O(\sqrt{\zeta_0\log(1/\zeta_0)})$. The developments are then combined to yield a robust instance optimal guarantee that resembles the standard one in linear compressed sensing.

Title: Online Convex Optimization for On-Board Routing in High-Throughput Satellites
Authors: Olivier Bélanger, Jean-Luc Lupien, Olfa Ben Yahia, Stéphane Martel, Antoine Lesage-Landry, Gunes Karabulut Kurt
Abstract: The rise in low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite Internet services has led to increasing demand, often exceeding available data rates and compromising the quality of service. While deploying more satellites offers a short-term fix, designing higher-performance satellites with enhanced transmission capabilities provides a more sustainable solution. Achieving the necessary high capacity requires interconnecting multiple modem banks within a satellite payload. However, there is a notable gap in research on internal packet routing within extremely high-throughput satellites. To address this, we propose a real-time optimal flow allocation and priority queue scheduling method using online convex optimization-based model predictive control. We model the problem as a multi-commodity flow instance and employ an online interior-point method to solve the routing and scheduling optimization iteratively. This approach minimizes packet loss and supports real-time rerouting with low computational overhead. Our method is tested in simulation on a next-generation extremely high-throughput satellite model, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to a reference batch optimization and to traditional methods.

Title: Convergence of energy-based learning in linear resistive networks
Authors: Anne-Men Huijzer, Thomas Chaffey, Bart Besselink, Henk J. van Waarde
Abstract: Energy-based learning algorithms are alternatives to backpropagation and are well-suited to distributed implementations in analog electronic devices. However, a rigorous theory of convergence is lacking. We make a first step in this direction by analysing a particular energybased learning algorithm, Contrastive Learning, applied to a network of linear adjustable resistors. It is shown that, in this setup, Contrastive Learning is equivalent to projected gradient descent on a convex function with Lipschitz continuous gradient, giving a guarantee of convergence of the algorithm for a range of stepsizes. This convergence result is then extended to a stochastic variant of Contrastive Learning.

Title: Assessing metadata privacy in neuroimaging
Authors: Emilie Kibsgaard, Anita Sue Jwa, Christopher J Markiewicz, David Rodriguez Gonzalez, Judith Sainz Pardo, Russell A. Poldrack, Cyril R. Pernet
Abstract: The ethical and legal imperative to share research data without causing harm requires careful attention to privacy risks. While mounting evidence demonstrates that data sharing benefits science, legitimate concerns persist regarding the potential leakage of personal information that could lead to reidentification and subsequent harm. We reviewed metadata accompanying neuroimaging datasets from heterogeneous studies openly available on OpenNeuro, involving participants across the lifespan, from children to older adults, with and without clinical diagnoses, and including associated clinical score data. Using metaprivBIDS (this https URL), a software application for BIDS compliant tsv/json files that computes and reports different privacy metrics (k-anonymity, k-global, l-diversity, SUDA, PIF), we found that privacy is generally well maintained, with serious vulnerabilities being rare. Nonetheless, issues were identified in nearly all datasets and warrant mitigation. Notably, clinical score data (e.g., neuropsychological results) posed minimal reidentification risk, whereas demographic variables: age, sex assigned at birth, sexual orientations, race, income, and geolocation, represented the principal privacy vulnerabilities. We outline practical measures to address these risks, enabling safer data sharing practices.

Title: SingMOS-Pro: An Comprehensive Benchmark for Singing Quality Assessment
Authors: Yuxun Tang, Lan Liu, Wenhao Feng, Yiwen Zhao, Jionghao Han, Yifeng Yu, Jiatong Shi, Qin Jin
Abstract: Singing voice generation progresses rapidly, yet evaluating singing quality remains a critical challenge. Human subjective assessment, typically in the form of listening tests, is costly and time consuming, while existing objective metrics capture only limited perceptual aspects. In this work, we introduce SingMOS-Pro, a dataset for automatic singing quality assessment. Building on our preview version SingMOS, which provides only overall ratings, SingMOS-Pro extends the annotations of the additional data to include lyrics, melody, and overall quality, offering broader coverage and greater diversity. The dataset contains 7,981 singing clips generated by 41 models across 12 datasets, spanning from early systems to recent state-of-the-art approaches. Each clip is rated by at least five experienced annotators to ensure reliability and consistency. Furthermore, we investigate strategies for effectively utilizing MOS data annotated under heterogeneous standards and benchmark several widely used evaluation methods from related tasks on SingMOS-Pro, establishing strong baselines and practical references for future research. The dataset is publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Universal Beta Splatting
Authors: Rong Liu, Zhongpai Gao, Benjamin Planche, Meida Chen, Van Nguyen Nguyen, Meng Zheng, Anwesa Choudhuri, Terrence Chen, Yue Wang, Andrew Feng, Ziyan Wu
Abstract: We introduce Universal Beta Splatting (UBS), a unified framework that generalizes 3D Gaussian Splatting to N-dimensional anisotropic Beta kernels for explicit radiance field rendering. Unlike fixed Gaussian primitives, Beta kernels enable controllable dependency modeling across spatial, angular, and temporal dimensions within a single representation. Our unified approach captures complex light transport effects, handles anisotropic view-dependent appearance, and models scene dynamics without requiring auxiliary networks or specific color encodings. UBS maintains backward compatibility by approximating to Gaussian Splatting as a special case, guaranteeing plug-in usability and lower performance bounds. The learned Beta parameters naturally decompose scene properties into interpretable without explicit supervision: spatial (surface vs. texture), angular (diffuse vs. specular), and temporal (static vs. dynamic). Our CUDA-accelerated implementation achieves real-time rendering while consistently outperforming existing methods across static, view-dependent, and dynamic benchmarks, establishing Beta kernels as a scalable universal primitive for radiance field rendering.

Title: Adaptive Multimodal Person Recognition: A Robust Framework for Handling Missing Modalities
Authors: Aref Farhadipour, Teodora Vukovic, Volker Dellwo, Petr Motlicek, Srikanth Madikeri
Abstract: Person identification systems often rely on audio, visual, or behavioral cues, but real-world conditions frequently present with missing or degraded modalities. To address this challenge, we propose a multimodal person identification framework incorporating upper-body motion, face, and voice. Experimental results demonstrate that body motion outperforms traditional modalities such as face and voice in within-session evaluations, while serving as a complementary cue that enhances performance in multi-session scenarios. Our model employs a unified hybrid fusion strategy, fusing both feature-level and score-level information to maximize representational richness and decision accuracy. Specifically, it leverages multi-task learning to process modalities independently, followed by cross-attention and gated fusion mechanisms to exploit both unimodal information and cross-modal interactions. Finally, a confidence-weighted strategy and mistake-correction mechanism dynamically adapt to missing data, ensuring that our single classification head achieves optimal performance even in unimodal and bimodal scenarios. We evaluate our method on CANDOR, a newly introduced interview-based multimodal dataset, which we benchmark in this work for the first time. Our results demonstrate that the proposed trimodal system achieves 99.51% Top-1 accuracy on person identification tasks. In addition, we evaluate our model on the VoxCeleb1 dataset as a widely used evaluation protocol and reach 99.92% accuracy in bimodal mode, outperforming conventional approaches. Moreover, we show that our system maintains high accuracy even when one or two modalities are unavailable, making it a robust solution for real-world person recognition applications. The code and data for this work are publicly available.

Title: Specifying and Verifying RDMA Synchronisation (Extended Version)
Authors: Guillaume Ambal, Max Stupple, Brijesh Dongol, Azalea Raad
Abstract: Remote direct memory access (RDMA) allows a machine to directly read from and write to the memory of remote machine, enabling high-throughput, low-latency data transfer. Ensuring correctness of RDMA programs has only recently become possible with the formalisation of $\text{RDMA}^\text{TSO}$ semantics (describing the behaviour of RDMA networking over a TSO CPU). However, this semantics currently lacks a formalisation of remote synchronisation, meaning that the implementations of common abstractions such as locks cannot be verified. In this paper, we close this gap by presenting $\text{RDMA}^{\text{TSO}}_{\text{RMW}}$, the first semantics for remote `read-modify-write' (RMW) instructions over TSO. It turns out that remote RMW operations are weak and only ensure atomicity against other remote RMWs. We therefore build a set of composable synchronisation abstractions starting with the $\text{RDMA}^{\text{WAIT}}_{\text{RMW}}$ library. Underpinned by $\text{RDMA}^{\text{WAIT}}_{\text{RMW}}$, we then specify, implement and verify three classes of remote locks that are suitable for different scenarios. Additionally, we develop the notion of a strong RDMA model, $\text{RDMA}^{\text{SC}}_{\text{RMW}}$, which is akin to sequential consistency in shared memory architectures. Our libraries are built to be compatible with an existing set of high-performance libraries called LOCO, which ensures compositionality and verifiability.

Title: Efficient Gaussian process learning via subspace projections
Authors: Elsa Cazelles, Felipe Tobar
Abstract: We propose a novel training objective for GPs constructed using lower-dimensional linear projections of the data, referred to as \emph{projected likelihood} (PL). We provide a closed-form expression for the information loss related to the PL and empirically show that it can be reduced with random projections on the unit sphere. We show the superiority of the PL, in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, over the exact GP training and the variational free energy approach to sparse GPs over different optimisers, kernels and datasets of moderately large sizes.
