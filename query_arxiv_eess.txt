Title: Neural Field-Based 3D Surface Reconstruction of Microstructures from Multi-Detector Signals in Scanning Electron Microscopy
Authors: Shuo Chen, Yijin Li, Xi Zheng, Guofeng Zhang
Abstract: The scanning electron microscope (SEM) is a widely used imaging device in scientific research and industrial applications. Conventional two-dimensional (2D) SEM images do not directly reveal the three-dimensional (3D) topography of micro samples, motivating the development of SEM 3D surface reconstruction methods. However, reconstruction of complex microstructures remains challenging for existing methods due to the limitations of discrete 3D representations, the need for calibration with reference samples, and shadow-induced gradient errors. Here, we introduce NFH-SEM, a neural field-based hybrid SEM 3D reconstruction method that takes multi-view, multi-detector 2D SEM images as input and fuses geometric and photometric information into a continuous neural field representation. NFH-SEM eliminates the manual calibration procedures through end-to-end self-calibration and automatically disentangles shadows from SEM images during training, enabling accurate reconstruction of intricate microstructures. We validate the effectiveness of NFH-SEM on real and simulated datasets. Our experiments show high-fidelity reconstructions of diverse, challenging samples, including two-photon lithography microstructures, peach pollen, and silicon carbide particle surfaces, demonstrating precise detail and broad applicability.

Title: Super-Resolution of Sentinel-2 Images Using a Geometry-Guided Back-Projection Network with Self-Attention
Authors: Ivan Pereira-Sánchez, Daniel Torres, Francesc Alcover, Bartomeu Garau, Julia Navarro, Catalina Sbert, Joan Duran
Abstract: The Sentinel-2 mission provides multispectral imagery with 13 bands at resolutions of 10m, 20m, and 60m. In particular, the 10m bands offer fine structural detail, while the 20m bands capture richer spectral information. In this paper, we propose a geometry-guided super-resolution model for fusing the 10m and 20m bands. Our approach introduces a cluster-based learning procedure to generate a geometry-rich guiding image from the 10m bands. This image is integrated into an unfolded back-projection architecture that leverages image self-similarities through a multi-head attention mechanism, which models nonlocal patch-based interactions across spatial and spectral dimensions. We also generate a dataset for evaluation, comprising three testing sets that include urban, rural, and coastal landscapes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms both classical and deep learning-based super-resolution and fusion techniques.

Title: Advanced Multi-Architecture Deep Learning Framework for BIRADS-Based Mammographic Image Retrieval: Comprehensive Performance Analysis with Super-Ensemble Optimization
Authors: MD Shaikh Rahman, Feiroz Humayara, Syed Maudud E Rabbi, Muhammad Mahbubur Rashid
Abstract: Content-based mammographic image retrieval systems require exact BIRADS categorical matching across five distinct classes, presenting significantly greater complexity than binary classification tasks commonly addressed in literature. Current medical image retrieval studies suffer from methodological limitations including inadequate sample sizes, improper data splitting, and insufficient statistical validation that hinder clinical translation. We developed a comprehensive evaluation framework systematically comparing CNN architectures (DenseNet121, ResNet50, VGG16) with advanced training strategies including sophisticated fine-tuning, metric learning, and super-ensemble optimization. Our evaluation employed rigorous stratified data splitting (50%/20%/30% train/validation/test), 602 test queries, and systematic validation using bootstrap confidence intervals with 1,000 samples. Advanced fine-tuning with differential learning rates achieved substantial improvements: DenseNet121 (34.79% precision@10, 19.64% improvement) and ResNet50 (34.54%, 19.58% improvement). Super-ensemble optimization combining complementary architectures achieved 36.33% precision@10 (95% CI: [34.78%, 37.88%]), representing 24.93% improvement over baseline and providing 3.6 relevant cases per query. Statistical analysis revealed significant performance differences between optimization strategies (p<0.001) with large effect sizes (Cohen's d>0.8), while maintaining practical search efficiency (2.8milliseconds). Performance significantly exceeds realistic expectations for 5-class medical retrieval tasks, where literature suggests 20-25% precision@10 represents achievable performance for exact BIRADS matching. Our framework establishes new performance benchmarks while providing evidence-based architecture selection guidelines for clinical deployment in diagnostic support and quality assurance applications.

Title: Deep Distillation Gradient Preconditioning for Inverse Problems
Authors: Romario Gualdrón-Hurtado, Roman Jacome, Leon Suarez, Laura Galvis, Henry Arguello
Abstract: Imaging inverse problems are commonly addressed by minimizing measurement consistency and signal prior terms. While huge attention has been paid to developing high-performance priors, even the most advanced signal prior may lose its effectiveness when paired with an ill-conditioned sensing matrix that hinders convergence and degrades reconstruction quality. In optimization theory, preconditioners allow improving the algorithm's convergence by transforming the gradient update. Traditional linear preconditioning techniques enhance convergence, but their performance remains limited due to their dependence on the structure of the sensing matrix. Learning-based linear preconditioners have been proposed, but they are optimized only for data-fidelity optimization, which may lead to solutions in the null-space of the sensing matrix. This paper employs knowledge distillation to design a nonlinear preconditioning operator. In our method, a teacher algorithm using a better-conditioned (synthetic) sensing matrix guides the student algorithm with an ill-conditioned sensing matrix through gradient matching via a preconditioning neural network. We validate our nonlinear preconditioner for plug-and-play FISTA in single-pixel, magnetic resonance, and super-resolution imaging tasks, showing consistent performance improvements and better empirical convergence.

Title: Keyword Spotting with Hyper-Matched Filters for Small Footprint Devices
Authors: Yael Segal-Feldman, Ann R. Bradlow, Matthew Goldrick, Joseph Keshet
Abstract: Open-vocabulary keyword spotting (KWS) refers to the task of detecting words or terms within speech recordings, regardless of whether they were included in the training data. This paper introduces an open-vocabulary keyword spotting model with state-of-the-art detection accuracy for small-footprint devices. The model is composed of a speech encoder, a target keyword encoder, and a detection network. The speech encoder is either a tiny Whisper or a tiny Conformer. The target keyword encoder is implemented as a hyper-network that takes the desired keyword as a character string and generates a unique set of weights for a convolutional layer, which can be considered as a keyword-specific matched filter. The detection network uses the matched-filter weights to perform a keyword-specific convolution, which guides the cross-attention mechanism of a Perceiver module in determining whether the target term appears in the recording. The results indicate that our system achieves state-of-the-art detection performance and generalizes effectively to out-of-domain conditions, including second-language (L2) speech. Notably, our smallest model, with just 4.2 million parameters, matches or outperforms models that are several times larger, demonstrating both efficiency and robustness.

Title: Linear Program-Based Stability Conditions for Nonlinear Autonomous Systems
Authors: Sadredin Hokmi, Mohammad Khajenejad
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to evaluating the asymptotic stability of equilibrium points in both continuous-time (CT) and discrete-time (DT) nonlinear autonomous systems. By utilizing indirect Lyapunov methods and linearizing system dynamics through Jacobian matrices, the methodology replaces traditional semi-definite programming (SDP) techniques with computationally efficient linear programming (LP) conditions. This substitution substantially lowers the computational burden, including time and memory usage, particularly for high-dimensional systems. The stability criteria are developed using matrix transformations and leveraging the structural characteristics of the system, improving scalability. Several examples demonstrated the computational efficiency of the proposed approach compared to the existing SDP-based criteria, particularly for high-dimensional systems.

Title: Sequence Aware SAC Control for Engine Fuel Consumption Optimization in Electrified Powertrain
Authors: Wafeeq Jaleel, Md Ragib Rownak, Athar Hanif, Sidra Ghayour Bhatti, Qadeer Ahmed
Abstract: As hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) gain traction in heavy-duty trucks, adaptive and efficient energy management is critical for reducing fuel consumption while maintaining battery charge for long operation times. We present a new reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm to optimize engine control in series HEVs. We reformulate the control task as a sequential decision-making problem and enhance SAC by incorporating Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and Decision Transformers (DTs) into both actor and critic networks to capture temporal dependencies and improve planning over time. To evaluate robustness and generalization, we train the models under diverse initial battery states, drive cycle durations, power demands, and input sequence lengths. Experiments show that the SAC agent with a DT-based actor and GRU-based critic was within 1.8% of Dynamic Programming (DP) in fuel savings on the Highway Fuel Economy Test (HFET) cycle, while the SAC agent with GRUs in both actor and critic networks, and FFN actor-critic agent were within 3.16% and 3.43%, respectively. On unseen drive cycles (US06 and Heavy Heavy-Duty Diesel Truck (HHDDT) cruise segment), generalized sequence-aware agents consistently outperformed feedforward network (FFN)-based agents, highlighting their adaptability and robustness in real-world settings.

Title: Closed-Form Successive Relative Transfer Function Vector Estimation based on Blind Oblique Projection Incorporating Noise Whitening
Authors: Henri Gode, Simon Doclo
Abstract: Relative transfer functions (RTFs) of sound sources play a crucial role in beamforming, enabling effective noise and interference suppression. This paper addresses the challenge of online estimating the RTF vectors of multiple sound sources in noisy and reverberant environments, for the specific scenario where sources activate successively. While the RTF vector of the first source can be estimated straightforwardly, the main challenge arises in estimating the RTF vectors of subsequent sources during segments where multiple sources are simultaneously active. The blind oblique projection (BOP) method has been proposed to estimate the RTF vector of a newly activating source by optimally blocking this source. However, this method faces several limitations: high computational complexity due to its reliance on iterative gradient descent optimization, the introduction of random additional vectors, which can negatively impact performance, and the assumption of high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To overcome these limitations, in this paper we propose three extensions to the BOP method. First, we derive a closed-form solution for optimizing the BOP cost function, significantly reducing computational complexity. Second, we introduce orthogonal additional vectors instead of random vectors, enhancing RTF vector estimation accuracy. Third, we incorporate noise handling techniques inspired by covariance subtraction and whitening, increasing robustness in low SNR conditions. To provide a frame-by-frame estimate of the source activity pattern, required by both the conventional BOP method and the proposed method, we propose a spatial-coherence-based online source counting method. Simulations are performed with real-world reverberant noisy recordings featuring 3 successively activating speakers, with and without a-priori knowledge of the source activity pattern.

Title: CryoGS: Gaussian Splatting for Cryo-EM Homogeneous Reconstruction
Authors: Suyi Chen, Haibin Ling
Abstract: As a critical modality for structural biology, cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) facilitates the determination of macromolecular structures at near-atomic resolution. The core computational task in single-particle cryo-EM is to reconstruct the 3D electrostatic potential of a molecule from a large collection of noisy 2D projections acquired at unknown orientations. Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) provide a continuous, compact, and physically interpretable representation for molecular density and have recently gained interest in cryo-EM reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on external consensus maps or atomic models for initialization, limiting their use in self-contained pipelines. Addressing this issue, we introduce cryoGS, a GMM-based method that integrates Gaussian splatting with the physics of cryo-EM image formation. In particular, we develop an orthogonal projection-aware Gaussian splatting, with adaptations such as a normalization term and FFT-aligned coordinate system tailored for cryo-EM imaging. All these innovations enable stable and efficient homogeneous reconstruction directly from raw cryo-EM particle images using random initialization. Experimental results on real datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of cryoGS over representative baselines. The code will be released upon publication.

Title: Real-Time Doppler and Ionospheric Dispersion Correction Techniques for Arbitrary Waveforms Utilizing GPU Compute
Authors: Daniel J. Vickers, A. H. Mack, Idahosa A. Osaretin
Abstract: General requirements for radar digital signal processing are ionospheric distortion and Doppler dispersion correction, which has historically required radar-specific hardware to implement in real time. Although analog solutions are computationally efficient, they often come with system design drawbacks which limit waveform flexibility and can result in an overall increase of system complexity. With improvements in modern general compute systems, real-time digital signal processing is becoming more realizable using non-radar-specific high-performance compute. In this paper, we present an analysis of general Doppler and ionospheric correction algorithms for arbitrary waveforms for radar digital signal processing. We also include considerations for efficient implementation of these algorithms in software, specifically using GPU hardware. This analysis includes metrics of performance such as execution time and error correction accuracy. We also provide recommendations for application in radar signal processing. We identify two algorithms for dispersion correction: an FFT-based method for ionospheric dispersion and a numerical interpolation method via sinc interpolation for Doppler dispersion. Both of these algorithms are able to compensate for dispersion equivalent in accuracy to waveform-specific analytical methods and were able to be performed in real-time on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU. These methods are waveform agnostic and applied directly to the samples, improving system flexibility and making them easy to incorporate into existing software-defined radio systems.

Title: Anti-Jamming Sensing with Distributed Reconfigurable Intelligent Metasurface Antennas
Authors: Zhaowei Wang, Yunsong Huang, Weicheng Liu, Hui-Ming Wang
Abstract: The utilization of radio frequency (RF) signals for wireless sensing has garnered increasing attention. However, the radio environment is unpredictable and often unfavorable, the sensing accuracy of traditional RF sensing methods is often affected by adverse propagation channels from the transmitter to the receiver, such as fading and noise. In this paper, we propose employing distributed Reconfigurable Intelligent Metasurface Antennas (RIMSA) to detect the presence and location of objects where multiple RIMSA receivers (RIMSA Rxs) are deployed on different places. By programming their beamforming patterns, RIMSA Rxs can enhance the quality of received signals. The RF sensing problem is modeled as a joint optimization problem of beamforming pattern and mapping of received signals to sensing outcomes. To address this challenge, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm aimed at calculating the optimal beamforming patterns and a neural network aimed at converting received signals into sensing outcomes. In addition, the malicious attacker may potentially launch jamming attack to disrupt sensing process. To enable effective sensing in interferenceprone environment, we devise a combined loss function that takes into account the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) of the received signals. The simulation results show that the proposed distributed RIMSA system can achieve more efficient sensing performance and better overcome environmental influences than centralized implementation. Furthermore, the introduced method ensures high-accuracy sensing performance even under jamming attack.

Title: Uncovering the Influence Flow Model of Transistor Amplifiers, Its Reconstruction and Application
Authors: Mohammed Tuhin Rana, Mishfad Shaikh Veedu, Murti V. Salapaka
Abstract: Multistage transistor amplifiers can be effectively modeled as network of dynamic systems where individual amplifier stages interact through couplings that are dynamic in nature. Using circuit analysis techniques, we show that a large class of transistor amplifiers can be modeled as Linear Dynamic Influence Model (LDIM), where the interactions between different amplifier stages are modeled as linear dynamic equations. LDIM modeling of transistor circuits leads to application of data-driven network reconstruction techniques to characterize stage interactions and identify faults and critical circuit parameters efficiently. Employing graphical modeling techniques and Wiener filtering, we demonstrate that the network structure can be reconstructed solely from voltage time-series measurements sampled at specified points in the circuit. The efficacy of these network reconstruction methods in multistage amplifiers is demonstrated through extensive simulations involving multiple amplifier circuits in Cadence, as well as experimental results on physical hardware. The ability to infer network structure directly from measurement data offers designers and users efficient tools to design, analyze, and debug amplifier circuits. To demonstrate the utility of network reconstruction in multistage amplifier circuits, a fault diagnosis method leveraging these techniques is presented.

Title: Localized Kernel Methods for Signal Processing
Authors: Sippanon Kitimoon
Abstract: This dissertation presents two signal processing methods using specially designed localized kernels for parameter recovery under noisy condition. The first method addresses the estimation of frequencies and amplitudes in multidimensional exponential models. It utilizes localized trigonometric polynomial kernels to detect the multivariate frequencies, followed by a more detailed parameter estimation. We compare our method with MUSIC and ESPRIT, which are classical subspace-based algorithms widely used for estimating the parameters of exponential signals. In the univariate case, the method outperforms MUSIC and ESPRIT under low signal-to-noise ratios. For the multivariate case, we develop a coordinate-wise projection and registration approach that achieves high recovery accuracy using significantly fewer samples than other methods. The second method focuses on separating linear chirp components from time-localized signal segments. A variant of the Signal Separation Operator (SSO) is constructed using a localized kernel. Instantaneous frequency estimates are obtained via FFT-based filtering, then clustered and fitted with piecewise linear regression. The method operates without prior knowledge of the number of components and is shown to recover intersecting and discontinuous chirps at SNR levels as low as -30 dB. Both methods share an idea based on localized kernels and efficient FFT-based implementation, and neither requires subspace decomposition or sparsity regularization. Experimental results confirm the robustness and tractability of the proposed approaches across a range of simulated data conditions. Potential extensions include application to nonlinear chirps, adaptive kernel design, and signal classification using extracted features.

Title: REF-VC: Robust, Expressive and Fast Zero-Shot Voice Conversion with Diffusion Transformers
Authors: Yuepeng Jiang, Ziqian Ning, Shuai Wang, Chengjia Wang, Mengxiao Bi, Pengcheng Zhu, Lei Xie, Zhonghua Fu
Abstract: In real-world voice conversion applications, environmental noise in source speech and user demands for expressive output pose critical challenges. Traditional ASR-based methods ensure noise robustness but suppress prosody, while SSL-based models improve expressiveness but suffer from timbre leakage and noise sensitivity. This paper proposes REF-VC, a noise-robust expressive voice conversion system. Key innovations include: (1) A random erasing strategy to mitigate the information redundancy inherent in SSL feature, enhancing noise robustness and expressiveness; (2) Implicit alignment inspired by E2TTS to suppress non-essential feature reconstruction; (3) Integration of Shortcut Models to accelerate flow matching inference, significantly reducing to 4 steps. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines such as Seed-VC in zero-shot scenarios on the noisy set, while also performing comparably to Seed-VC on the clean set. In addition, REF-VC can be compatible with singing voice conversion within one model.

Title: MedMambaLite: Hardware-Aware Mamba for Medical Image Classification
Authors: Romina Aalishah, Mozhgan Navardi, Tinoosh Mohsenin
Abstract: AI-powered medical devices have driven the need for real-time, on-device inference such as biomedical image classification. Deployment of deep learning models at the edge is now used for applications such as anomaly detection and classification in medical images. However, achieving this level of performance on edge devices remains challenging due to limitations in model size and computational capacity. To address this, we present MedMambaLite, a hardware-aware Mamba-based model optimized through knowledge distillation for medical image classification. We start with a powerful MedMamba model, integrating a Mamba structure for efficient feature extraction in medical imaging. We make the model lighter and faster in training and inference by modifying and reducing the redundancies in the architecture. We then distill its knowledge into a smaller student model by reducing the embedding dimensions. The optimized model achieves 94.5% overall accuracy on 10 MedMNIST datasets. It also reduces parameters 22.8x compared to MedMamba. Deployment on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano achieves 35.6 GOPS/J energy per inference. This outperforms MedMamba by 63% improvement in energy per inference.

Title: MOVER: Combining Multiple Meeting Recognition Systems
Authors: Naoyuki Kamo, Tsubasa Ochiai, Marc Delcroix, Tomohiro Nakatani
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Meeting recognizer Output Voting Error Reduction (MOVER), a novel system combination method for meeting recognition tasks. Although there are methods to combine the output of diarization (e.g., DOVER) or automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems (e.g., ROVER), MOVER is the first approach that can combine the outputs of meeting recognition systems that differ in terms of both diarization and ASR. MOVER combines hypotheses with different time intervals and speaker labels through a five-stage process that includes speaker alignment, segment grouping, word and timing combination, etc. Experimental results on the CHiME-8 DASR task and the multi-channel track of the NOTSOFAR-1 task demonstrate that MOVER can successfully combine multiple meeting recognition systems with diverse diarization and recognition outputs, achieving relative tcpWER improvements of 9.55 % and 8.51 % over the state-of-the-art systems for both tasks.

Title: Probabilistic Alternating Simulations for Policy Synthesis in Uncertain Stochastic Dynamical Systems
Authors: Thom Badings, Alessandro Abate
Abstract: A classical approach to formal policy synthesis in stochastic dynamical systems is to construct a finite-state abstraction, often represented as a Markov decision process (MDP). The correctness of these approaches hinges on a behavioural relation between the dynamical system and its abstraction, such as a probabilistic simulation relation. However, probabilistic simulation relations do not suffice when the system dynamics are, next to being stochastic, also subject to nondeterministic (i.e., set-valued) disturbances. In this work, we extend probabilistic simulation relations to systems with both stochastic and nondeterministic disturbances. Our relation, which is inspired by a notion of alternating simulation, generalises existing relations used for verification and policy synthesis used in several works. Intuitively, our relation allows reasoning probabilistically over stochastic uncertainty, while reasoning robustly (i.e., adversarially) over nondeterministic disturbances. We experimentally demonstrate the applicability of our relations for policy synthesis in a 4D-state Dubins vehicle.

Title: Power-Constrained and Quantized MIMO-RSMA Systems with Imperfect CSIT: Joint Precoding, Antenna Selection, and Power Control
Authors: Jiwon Sung, Seokjun Park, Jinseok Choi
Abstract: To utilize the full potential of the available power at a base station (BS), we propose a joint precoding, antenna selection, and transmit power control algorithm for a total power budget at the BS. We formulate a sum spectral efficiency (SE) maximization problem for downlink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) systems with arbitrary-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs). We reformulate the problem by defining the ergodic sum SE using the conditional average rate approach to handle imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), and by using approximation techniques to make the problem more tractable. Then, we decompose the problem into precoding direction and power control subproblems. We solve the precoding direction subproblem by identifying a superior Lagrangian stationary point, and the power control subproblem using gradient descent. We also propose a complexity-reduction approach that is more suitable for massive MIMO systems. Simulation results not only validate the proposed algorithm but also reveal that when utilizing the full potential of the power budget at the BS, medium-resolution DACs with 8-11 bits may actually be more power-efficient than low-resolution DACs.

Title: Fairness in Dysarthric Speech Synthesis: Understanding Intrinsic Bias in Dysarthric Speech Cloning using F5-TTS
Authors: Anuprabha M, Krishna Gurugubelli, Anil Kumar Vuppala
Abstract: Dysarthric speech poses significant challenges in developing assistive technologies, primarily due to the limited availability of data. Recent advances in neural speech synthesis, especially zero-shot voice cloning, facilitate synthetic speech generation for data augmentation; however, they may introduce biases towards dysarthric speech. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art F5-TTS in cloning dysarthric speech using TORGO dataset, focusing on intelligibility, speaker similarity, and prosody preservation. We also analyze potential biases using fairness metrics like Disparate Impact and Parity Difference to assess disparities across dysarthric severity levels. Results show that F5-TTS exhibits a strong bias toward speech intelligibility over speaker and prosody preservation in dysarthric speech synthesis. Insights from this study can help integrate fairness-aware dysarthric speech synthesis, fostering the advancement of more inclusive speech technologies.

Title: Digital Twin Channel-Aided CSI Prediction: A Environment-based Subspace Extraction Approach for Achieving Low Overhead and Robustness
Authors: Yichen Cai, Jianhua Zhang, Li Yu, Zhen Zhang, Yuxiang Zhang, Lianzheng Shi, Yuelong Qiu
Abstract: To meet the robust and high-speed communication requirements of the sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication system in complex scenarios, sensing- and artificial intelligence (AI)-based digital twin channel (DTC) techniques become a promising approach to reduce system overhead. In this paper, we propose an environment-specific channel subspace basis (EB)-aided partial-to-whole channel state information (CSI) prediction method (EB-P2WCP) for realizing DTC-enabled low-overhead channel prediction. Specifically, EB is utilized to characterize the static properties of the electromagnetic environment, which is extracted from the digital twin map, serving as environmental information prior to the prediction task. Then, we fuse EB with real-time estimated local CSI to predict the entire spatial-frequency domain channel for both the present and future time instances. Hence, an EB-based partial-to-whole CSI prediction network (EB-P2WNet) is designed to achieve a robust channel prediction scheme in various complex scenarios. Simulation results indicate that incorporating EB provides significant benefits under low signal-to-noise ratio and pilot ratio conditions, achieving a reduction of up to 50% in pilot overhead. Additionally, the proposed method maintains robustness against multi-user interference, tolerating 3-meter localization errors with only a 0.5 dB NMSE increase, and predicts CSI for the next channel coherent time within 1.3 milliseconds.

Title: Speech LLMs in Low-Resource Scenarios: Data Volume Requirements and the Impact of Pretraining on High-Resource Languages
Authors: Seraphina Fong, Marco Matassoni, Alessio Brutti
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in handling spoken inputs for high-resource languages, reaching state-of-the-art performance in various tasks. However, their applicability is still less explored in low-resource settings. This work investigates the use of Speech LLMs for low-resource Automatic Speech Recognition using the SLAM-ASR framework, where a trainable lightweight projector connects a speech encoder and a LLM. Firstly, we assess training data volume requirements to match Whisper-only performance, re-emphasizing the challenges of limited data. Secondly, we show that leveraging mono- or multilingual projectors pretrained on high-resource languages reduces the impact of data scarcity, especially with small training sets. Using multilingual LLMs (EuroLLM, Salamandra) with whisper-large-v3-turbo, we evaluate performance on several public benchmarks, providing insights for future research on optimizing Speech LLMs for low-resource languages and multilinguality.

Title: Preparing for the worst: Long-term and short-term weather extremes in resource adequacy assessment
Authors: Aleksander Grochowicz, Hannah C. Bloomfield, Marta Victoria
Abstract: Security of supply is a common and important concern when integrating renewables in net-zero power systems. Extreme weather affects both demand and supply leading to power system stress; in Europe this stress spreads continentally beyond the meteorological root cause. We use an approach based on shadow prices to identify periods of elevated stress called system-defining events and analyse their impact on the power system. By classifying different types of system-defining events, we identify challenges to power system operation and planning. Crucially, we find the need for sufficient resilience back-up (power) capacities whose financial viability is precarious due to weather variability. Furthermore, we disentangle short- and long-term resilience challenges with distinct metrics and stress tests to incorporate both into future energy modelling assessments. Our methodology and implementation in the open model PyPSA-Eur can be re-applied to other systems and help researchers and policymakers in building more resilient and adequate energy systems.

Title: Beyond Pixels: Medical Image Quality Assessment with Implicit Neural Representations
Authors: Caner Özer, Patryk Rygiel, Bram de Wilde, İlkay Öksüz, Jelmer M. Wolterink
Abstract: Artifacts pose a significant challenge in medical imaging, impacting diagnostic accuracy and downstream analysis. While image-based approaches for detecting artifacts can be effective, they often rely on preprocessing methods that can lead to information loss and high-memory-demand medical images, thereby limiting the scalability of classification models. In this work, we propose the use of implicit neural representations (INRs) for image quality assessment. INRs provide a compact and continuous representation of medical images, naturally handling variations in resolution and image size while reducing memory overhead. We develop deep weight space networks, graph neural networks, and relational attention transformers that operate on INRs to achieve image quality assessment. Our method is evaluated on the ACDC dataset with synthetically generated artifact patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in assessing image quality while achieving similar performance with fewer parameters.

Title: Overview of Controllability Definitions in Supervisory Control Theory
Authors: Jeroen J.A. Keiren, Michel A. Reniers
Abstract: In the field of supervisory control theory, the literature often proposes different definitions for the same concept, making it difficult to understand how these definitions are related. This is definitely so for the fundamental notion of controllability of a supervisor w.r.t. a plant. This paper lists definitions of controllability found in the literature and studies their relationships in settings of both deterministic and nondeterministic automata. In the general context, where both the supervisor and the plant are allowed to be nondeterministic, the notions of controllability as described by Flordal and Malik, and uncontrollable event admissibility by Kushi and Takai are equivalent. These are also the only notions that imply the traditional notion of (language) controllability. From a practical perspective, one is often more interested in controllability of a supervised plant w.r.t. a plant. In this context, in addition to the previous two controllability notions, state controllability by Zhou et al. implies language controllability.

Title: Optimization of Liquid Lens-based Imaging Receiver for MIMO VLC Systems
Authors: Kapila W. S. Palitharathna, Christodoulos Skouroumounis, Ioannis Krikidis
Abstract: In this paper, a liquid lens-based imaging receiver is proposed for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) visible light communication (VLC) systems. By dynamically adjusting the focal length and orientation angles of the liquid lens, the spatial correlation between MIMO channel gains is reduced, leading to enhanced bit-error rate (BER) performance. Unlike static lenses, liquid lenses offer adaptability in dynamic conditions, including user mobility and random receiver orientation. An accurate mathematical framework is developed to model the channel gains of the proposed system, and an optimization problem is formulated to minimize its BER. Due to the complexity of the resulting channel model, two lens adjustment schemes, namely, ($i$) the CLS scheme, and ($ii$) the VULO scheme are introduced. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed liquid lens-based system offers substantial BER improvements over conventional static lens-based receivers across a wide range of random receiver orientation conditions. Specifically, at a random receiver orientation variance of $10^{\circ}$, the BER is improved from $4\times 10^{-2}$ to $5\times 10^{-4}$ by employing the proposed liquid lens.

Title: Deep Learning Based Dynamic Environment Reconstruction for Vehicular ISAC Scenarios
Authors: Junzhe Song, Ruisi He, Mi Yang, Zhengyu Zhang, Bingcheng Liu, Jiahui Han, Haoxiang Zhang, Bo Ai
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) technology plays a critical role in future intelligent transportation systems, by enabling vehicles to perceive and reconstruct the surrounding environment through reuse of wireless signals, thereby reducing or even eliminating the need for additional sensors such as LiDAR or radar. However, existing ISAC based reconstruction methods often lack the ability to track dynamic scenes with sufficient accuracy and temporal consistency, limiting the real world applicability. To address this limitation, we propose a deep learning based framework for vehicular environment reconstruction by using ISAC channels. We first establish a joint channel environment dataset based on multi modal measurements from real world urban street scenarios. Then, a multistage deep learning network is developed to reconstruct the environment. Specifically, a scene decoder identifies the environmental context such as buildings, trees and so on; a cluster center decoder predicts coarse spatial layouts by localizing dominant scattering centers; a point cloud decoder recovers fine grained geometry and structure of surrounding environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high-quality dynamic environment reconstruction with a Chamfer Distance of 0.29 and F Score@1% of 0.87. In addition, complexity analysis demonstrates the efficiency and practical applicability of the method in real time scenarios. This work provides a pathway toward low cost environment reconstruction based on ISAC for future intelligent transportation.

Authors: Junyi Wang, Xi Zhu, Yikun Guo, Zixi Wang, Haichuan Gao, Le Zhang, Fan Zhang
Abstract: We developed a pipeline for registering pre-surgery Magnetic Resonance (MR) images and post-resection Ultrasound (US) images. Our approach leverages unpaired style transfer using 3D CycleGAN to generate synthetic T1 images, thereby enhancing registration performance. Additionally, our registration process employs both affine and local deformable transformations for a coarse-to-fine registration. The results demonstrate that our approach improves the consistency between MR and US image pairs in most cases.

Title: Privacy Disclosure of Similarity in Speech and Language Processing
Authors: Tom Bäckström, Mohammad Hassan Vali, My Nguyen, Silas Rech
Abstract: Speaker, author, and other biometric identification applications often compare a sample's similarity to a database of templates to determine the identity. Given that data may be noisy and similarity measures can be inaccurate, such a comparison may not reliably identify the true identity as the most similar. Still, even the similarity rank based on an inaccurate similarity measure can disclose private information about the true identity. We propose a methodology for quantifying the privacy disclosure of such a similarity rank by estimating its probability distribution. It is based on determining the histogram of the similarity rank of the true speaker, or when data is scarce, modeling the histogram with the beta-binomial distribution. We express the disclosure in terms of entropy (bits), such that the disclosure from independent features are additive. Our experiments demonstrate that all tested speaker and author characterizations contain personally identifying information (PII) that can aid in identification, with embeddings from speaker recognition algorithms containing the most information, followed by phone embeddings, linguistic embeddings, and fundamental frequency. Our initial experiments show that the disclosure of PII increases with the length of test samples, but it is bounded by the length of database templates. The provided metric, similarity rank disclosure, provides a way to compare the disclosure of PII between biometric features and merge them to aid identification. It can thus aid in the holistic evaluation of threats to privacy in speech and other biometric technologies.

Title: Passive nonlinear FIR filters for data-driven control
Authors: Zixing Wang, Fulvio Forni
Abstract: We propose a new class of passive nonlinear finite impulse response operators. This class is constructed by the action of finite impulse response filters in a lifted space. This allows for efficient control synthesis through constrained optimization. Closed-loop performance is taken into account through least-squares fitting, based on the theory of virtual reference feedback tuning. Passivity is established through efficient linear constraints, based on sampling in the frequency domain. Because of passivity, this class of operators is particularly suited for the control of physical systems, such as electromechanical systems.

Title: Investigation of Speech and Noise Latent Representations in Single-channel VAE-based Speech Enhancement
Authors: Jiatong Li, Simon Doclo
Abstract: Recently, a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based single-channel speech enhancement system using Bayesian permutation training has been proposed, which uses two pretrained VAEs to obtain latent representations for speech and noise. Based on these pretrained VAEs, a noisy VAE learns to generate speech and noise latent representations from noisy speech for speech enhancement. Modifying the pretrained VAE loss terms affects the pretrained speech and noise latent representations. In this paper, we investigate how these different representations affect speech enhancement performance. Experiments on the DNS3, WSJ0-QUT, and VoiceBank-DEMAND datasets show that a latent space where speech and noise representations are clearly separated significantly improves performance over standard VAEs, which produce overlapping speech and noise representations.

Title: Unifying Common Signal Analyses with Instantaneous Time-Frequency Atoms
Authors: Steven Sandoval, Phillip L. De Leon
Abstract: In previous work, we presented a general framework for instantaneous time-frequency analysis but did not provide any specific details of how to compute a particular instantaneous spectrum (IS). In this work, we use instantaneous time-frequency atoms to obtain an IS associated with common signal analyses: time domain analysis, frequency domain analysis, fractional Fourier transform, synchrosqueezed short-time Fourier transform, and synchrosqueezed short-time fractional Fourier transform. By doing so, we demonstrate how the general framework can be used to unify these analyses and we develop closed-form expressions for the corresponding ISs. This is accomplished by viewing these analyses as decompositions into AM--FM components and recognizing that each uses a specialized (or limiting) form of a quadratic chirplet as a template during analysis. With a two-parameter quadratic chirplet, we can organize these ISs into a 2D continuum with points in the plane corresponding to a decomposition related to one of the signal analyses. Finally, using several example signals, we compute in closed-form the ISs for the various analyses.

Abstract: Spitz tumors are diagnostically challenging due to overlap in atypical histological features with conventional melanomas. We investigated to what extent AI models, using histological and/or clinical features, can: (1) distinguish Spitz tumors from conventional melanomas; (2) predict the underlying genetic aberration of Spitz tumors; and (3) predict the diagnostic category of Spitz tumors. The AI models were developed and validated using a dataset of 393 Spitz tumors and 379 conventional melanomas. Predictive performance was measured using the AUROC and the accuracy. The performance of the AI models was compared with that of four experienced pathologists in a reader study. Moreover, a simulation experiment was conducted to investigate the impact of implementing AI-based recommendations for ancillary diagnostic testing on the workflow of the pathology department. The best AI model based on UNI features reached an AUROC of 0.95 and an accuracy of 0.86 in differentiating Spitz tumors from conventional melanomas. The genetic aberration was predicted with an accuracy of 0.55 compared to 0.25 for randomly guessing. The diagnostic category was predicted with an accuracy of 0.51, where random chance-level accuracy equaled 0.33. On all three tasks, the AI models performed better than the four pathologists, although differences were not statistically significant for most individual comparisons. Based on the simulation experiment, implementing AI-based recommendations for ancillary diagnostic testing could reduce material costs, turnaround times, and examinations. In conclusion, the AI models achieved a strong predictive performance in distinguishing between Spitz tumors and conventional melanomas. On the more challenging tasks of predicting the genetic aberration and the diagnostic category of Spitz tumors, the AI models performed better than random chance.

Title: MM2CT: MR-to-CT translation for multi-modal image fusion with mamba
Authors: Chaohui Gong, Zhiying Wu, Zisheng Huang, Gaofeng Meng, Zhen Lei, Hongbin Liu
Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR)-to-computed tomography (CT) translation offers significant advantages, including the elimination of radiation exposure associated with CT scans and the mitigation of imaging artifacts caused by patient motion. The existing approaches are based on single-modality MR-to-CT translation, with limited research exploring multimodal fusion. To address this limitation, we introduce Multi-modal MR to CT (MM2CT) translation method by leveraging multimodal T1- and T2-weighted MRI data, an innovative Mamba-based framework for multi-modal medical image synthesis. Mamba effectively overcomes the limited local receptive field in CNNs and the high computational complexity issues in Transformers. MM2CT leverages this advantage to maintain long-range dependencies modeling capabilities while achieving multi-modal MR feature integration. Additionally, we incorporate a dynamic local convolution module and a dynamic enhancement module to improve MRI-to-CT synthesis. The experiments on a public pelvis dataset demonstrate that MM2CT achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).

Title: Sub- μ W Battery-Less and Oscillator-Less Wi-Fi Backscattering Transmitter Reusing RF Signal for Harvesting, Communications, and Motion Detection
Authors: Marco Privitera, Andrea Ballo, Karim Ali Ahmed, Alfio Dario Grasso, Massimo Alioto
Abstract: In this paper, a sub-uW power 802.11b backscattering transmitter is presented to enable reuse of the same incident wave for three purposes: RF harvesting, backscattering communications and position/motion sensing. The removal of the battery and any off-chip motion sensor (e.g., MEMS) enables unprecedented level of miniaturization and ubiquity, unrestricted device lifespan, low fabrication and maintenance cost. The uW power wall for WiFi transmitters is broken for the first time via local oscillator elimination, as achieved by extracting its frequency through second-order intermodulation of a twotone incident wave. The two-tone scheme also enables a cumulative harvesting/transmission/sensing sensitivity down to Pmin -19 dBm. Position/motion sensing is enabled by using the harvested voltage as a proxy for the Received Signal Strength (RSS), allowing to sense the chip location with respect to the tone generator(s) shared across tags in indoor neighborhoods.

This survey covers more than two decades of research on power and thermal modeling and management in modern processors. We start by comparing analytical, regression-based, and neural network-based techniques for power estimation, then review thermal modeling methods, including finite element, finite difference, and data-driven approaches. Next, we categorize dynamic runtime management strategies that balance performance, power consumption, and reliability. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of emerging challenges and promising research directions.

Title: 0.6-V, uW-Power 4-Stage OTA with Minimal Components and 100X Load Range
Authors: M. Privitera, A. D. Grasso, A. Ballo, M. Alioto
Abstract: A four-stage operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) for ultra-low-power applications is introduced in this paper. The proposed circuit inclusive of frequency compensation requires minimal transistor count and passives, overcoming the traditionally difficult compensation of 4-stage OTAs and bringing it back to the simplicity of 3-stage OTAs. At the same time, the proposed circuit achieves high power efficiency, as evidenced by the >3.7X (>11.3X) improvement in the large-signal (small-signal) power efficiency figure of merit FOML (FOMS), compared to prior 4-stage OTAs (sub-1 V multi-stage OTAs). Thanks to the lower sensitivity of the phase margin to the load capacitance, the proposed OTA remains stable under a wide range of loads (double-sided as in any 3-4-stage OTA), achieving a max/min ratio of the load capacitance of >100X.

Title: Research on integrated intelligent energy management system based on big data analysis and machine learning
Authors: Jinzhou Xu, Yadan Zhang, Paola Tapia
Abstract: The application of big data is one of the significant features of integrated smart energy. Applying it to the file management of integrated smart energy projects is of great significance for improving the efficiency of project management and control. This article first discussed the benefits and challenges of implementing big data analysis in document management and control of integrated smart energy projects. In addition, an implementation framework for big data analysis in integrated smart energy project document management was developed, and a method for optimizing the efficiency of integrated smart energy project document management through machine learning was proposed. Using various types of data and information generated during the project document management process, the efficiency of the entire process project document control through three different machine learning methods was optimized. The result of fitting a penalty linear regression model shows that when there is enough data as a training set, the accuracy of the model achieved can reach over 95\%. By using big data analysis and machine learning to analyze the efficiency of comprehensive smart energy project document management, it is possible to track the entire process of comprehensive smart energy project documents and optimize business processes, thereby strengthening project construction control and improving project construction efficiency.

Title: Error Bounds for Radial Network Topology Learning from Quantized Measurements
Authors: Samuel Talkington, Aditya Rangarajan, Pedro A. de Alcântara, Line Roald, Daniel K. Molzahn, Daniel R. Fuhrmann
Abstract: We probabilistically bound the error of a solution to a radial network topology learning problem where both connectivity and line parameters are estimated. In our model, data errors are introduced by the precision of the sensors, i.e., quantization. This produces a nonlinear measurement model that embeds the operation of the sensor communication network into the learning problem, expanding beyond the additive noise models typically seen in power system estimation algorithms. We show that the error of a learned radial network topology is proportional to the quantization bin width and grows sublinearly in the number of nodes, provided that the number of samples per node is logarithmic in the number of nodes.

Title: A General Control Method for Human-Robot Integration
Authors: Maddalena Feder, Giorgio Grioli, Manuel G. Catalano, Antonio Bicchi
Abstract: This paper introduces a new generalized control method designed for multi-degrees-of-freedom devices to help people with limited motion capabilities in their daily activities. The challenge lies in finding the most adapted strategy for the control interface to effectively map user's motions in a low-dimensional space to complex robotic assistive devices, such as prostheses, supernumerary limbs, up to remote robotic avatars. The goal is a system which integrates the human and the robotic parts into a unique system, moving so as to reach the targets decided by the human while autonomously reducing the user's effort and discomfort. We present a framework to control general multi DoFs assistive systems, which translates user-performed compensatory motions into the necessary robot commands for reaching targets while canceling or reducing compensation. The framework extends to prostheses of any number of DoF up to full robotic avatars, regarded here as a sort of whole-body prosthesis of the person who sees the robot as an artificial extension of their own body without a physical link but with a sensory-motor integration. We have validated and applied this control strategy through tests encompassing simulated scenarios and real-world trials involving a virtual twin of the robotic parts (prosthesis and robot) and a physical humanoid avatar.

Title: RDDPM: Robust Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Unsupervised Anomaly Segmentation
Authors: Mehrdad Moradi, Kamran Paynabar
Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated significant success in unsupervised anomaly segmentation. For anomaly segmentation, these models are first trained on normal data; then, an anomalous image is noised to an intermediate step, and the normal image is reconstructed through backward diffusion. Unlike traditional statistical methods, diffusion models do not rely on specific assumptions about the data or target anomalies, making them versatile for use across different domains. However, diffusion models typically assume access to normal data for training, limiting their applicability in realistic settings. In this paper, we propose novel robust denoising diffusion models for scenarios where only contaminated (i.e., a mix of normal and anomalous) unlabeled data is available. By casting maximum likelihood estimation of the data as a nonlinear regression problem, we reinterpret the denoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens. Using robust regression, we derive a robust version of denoising diffusion probabilistic models. Our novel framework offers flexibility in constructing various robust diffusion models. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms current state of the art diffusion models, for unsupervised anomaly segmentation when only contaminated data is available. Our method outperforms existing diffusion-based approaches, achieving up to 8.08\% higher AUROC and 10.37\% higher AUPRC on MVTec datasets. The implementation code is available at: this https URL

Title: Prescriptive Agents based on Rag for Automated Maintenance (PARAM)
Authors: Chitranshu Harbola, Anupam Purwar
Abstract: Industrial machinery maintenance requires timely intervention to prevent catastrophic failures and optimize operational efficiency. This paper presents an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial sectors.

Title: Toward Low-Latency End-to-End Voice Agents for Telecommunications Using Streaming ASR, Quantized LLMs, and Real-Time TTS
Authors: Vignesh Ethiraj, Ashwath David, Sidhanth Menon, Divya Vijay
Abstract: We introduce a low-latency telecom AI voice agent pipeline for real-time, interactive telecommunications use, enabling advanced voice AI for call center automation, intelligent IVR (Interactive Voice Response), and AI-driven customer support. The solution is built for telecom, combining four specialized models by NetoAI: TSLAM, a 4-bit quantized Telecom-Specific Large Language Model (LLM); T-VEC, a Telecom-Specific Embedding Model; TTE, a Telecom-Specific Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model; and T-Synth, a Telecom-Specific Text-to-Speech (TTS) model. These models enable highly responsive, domain-adapted voice AI agents supporting knowledge-grounded spoken interactions with low latency. The pipeline integrates streaming ASR (TTE), conversational intelligence (TSLAM), retrieval augmented generation (RAG) over telecom documents, and real-time TTS (T-Synth), setting a new benchmark for telecom voice assistants. To evaluate the system, we built a dataset of 500 human-recorded telecom questions from RFCs, simulating real telecom agent queries. This framework allows analysis of latency, domain relevance, and real-time performance across the stack. Results show that TSLAM, TTE, and T-Synth deliver real-time factors (RTF) below 1.0, supporting enterprise, low-latency telecom deployments. These AI agents -- powered by TSLAM, TTE, and T-Synth -- provide a foundation for next-generation telecom AI, enabling automated customer support, diagnostics, and more.

Title: Wearable Music2Emotion : Assessing Emotions Induced by AI-Generated Music through Portable EEG-fNIRS Fusion
Authors: Sha Zhao, Song Yi, Yangxuan Zhou, Jiadong Pan, Jiquan Wang, Jie Xia, Shijian Li, Shurong Dong, Gang Pan
Abstract: Emotions critically influence mental health, driving interest in music-based affective computing via neurophysiological signals with Brain-computer Interface techniques. While prior studies leverage music's accessibility for emotion induction, three key limitations persist: \textbf{(1) Stimulus Constraints}: Music stimuli are confined to small corpora due to copyright and curation costs, with selection biases from heuristic emotion-music mappings that ignore individual affective profiles. \textbf{(2) Modality Specificity}: Overreliance on unimodal neural data (e.g., EEG) ignores complementary insights from cross-modal signal fusion.\textbf{ (3) Portability Limitation}: Cumbersome setups (e.g., 64+ channel gel-based EEG caps) hinder real-world applicability due to procedural complexity and portability barriers. To address these limitations, we propose MEEtBrain, a portable and multimodal framework for emotion analysis (valence/arousal), integrating AI-generated music stimuli with synchronized EEG-fNIRS acquisition via a wireless headband. By MEEtBrain, the music stimuli can be automatically generated by AI on a large scale, eliminating subjective selection biases while ensuring music diversity. We use our developed portable device that is designed in a lightweight headband-style and uses dry electrodes, to simultaneously collect EEG and fNIRS recordings. A 14-hour dataset from 20 participants was collected in the first recruitment to validate the framework's efficacy, with AI-generated music eliciting target emotions (valence/arousal). We are actively expanding our multimodal dataset (44 participants in the latest dataset) and make it publicly available to promote further research and practical applications. \textbf{The dataset is available at this https URL.

Title: Adaptive k-space Radial Sampling for Cardiac MRI with Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Ruru Xu, Ilkay Oksuz
Abstract: Accelerated Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) requires careful optimization of k-space sampling patterns to balance acquisition speed and image quality. While recent advances in deep learning have shown promise in optimizing Cartesian sampling, the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) for non-Cartesian trajectory optimization remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present a novel RL framework for optimizing radial sampling trajectories in cardiac MRI. Our approach features a dual-branch architecture that jointly processes k-space and image-domain information, incorporating a cross-attention fusion mechanism to facilitate effective information exchange between domains. The framework employs an anatomically-aware reward design and a golden-ratio sampling strategy to ensure uniform k-space coverage while preserving cardiac structural details. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively learns optimal radial sampling strategies across multiple acceleration factors, achieving improved reconstruction quality compared to conventional approaches.

Title: Cross-Domain Image Synthesis: Generating H&E from Multiplex Biomarker Imaging
Authors: Jillur Rahman Saurav, Mohammad Sadegh Nasr, Jacob M. Luber
Abstract: While multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) imaging provides deep, spatially-resolved molecular data, integrating this information with the morphological standard of Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) can be very important for obtaining complementary information about the underlying tissue. Generating a virtual H&E stain from mIF data offers a powerful solution, providing immediate morphological context. Crucially, this approach enables the application of the vast ecosystem of H&E-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools to analyze rich molecular data, bridging the gap between molecular and morphological analysis. In this work, we investigate the use of a multi-level Vector-Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (VQGAN) to create high-fidelity virtual H&E stains from mIF images. We rigorously evaluated our VQGAN against a standard conditional GAN (cGAN) baseline on two publicly available colorectal cancer datasets, assessing performance on both image similarity and functional utility for downstream analysis. Our results show that while both architectures produce visually plausible images, the virtual stains generated by our VQGAN provide a more effective substrate for computer-aided diagnosis. Specifically, downstream nuclei segmentation and semantic preservation in tissue classification tasks performed on VQGAN-generated images demonstrate superior performance and agreement with ground-truth analysis compared to those from the cGAN. This work establishes that a multi-level VQGAN is a robust and superior architecture for generating scientifically useful virtual stains, offering a viable pathway to integrate the rich molecular data of mIF into established and powerful H&E-based analytical workflows.

Title: Enhancing Dialogue Annotation with Speaker Characteristics Leveraging a Frozen LLM
Authors: Thomas Thebaud, Yen-Ju Lu, Matthew Wiesner, Peter Viechnicki, Najim Dehak
Abstract: In dialogue transcription pipelines, Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently employed in post-processing to improve grammar, punctuation, and readability. We explore a complementary post-processing step: enriching transcribed dialogues by adding metadata tags for speaker characteristics such as age, gender, and emotion. Some of the tags are global to the entire dialogue, while some are time-variant. Our approach couples frozen audio foundation models, such as Whisper or WavLM, with a frozen LLAMA language model to infer these speaker attributes, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning of either model. Using lightweight, efficient connectors to bridge audio and language representations, we achieve competitive performance on speaker profiling tasks while preserving modularity and speed. Additionally, we demonstrate that a frozen LLAMA model can compare x-vectors directly, achieving an Equal Error Rate of 8.8% in some scenarios.

Title: Optimality Principles and Neural Ordinary Differential Equations-based Process Modeling for Distributed Control
Authors: Michael R. Wartmann, B. Erik Ydstie
Abstract: Most recent advances in machine learning and analytics for process control pose the question of how to naturally integrate new data-driven methods with classical process models and control. We propose a process modeling framework enabling integration of data-driven algorithms through consistent topological properties and conservation of extensive quantities. Interconnections among process network units are represented through connectivity matrices and network graphs. We derive the system's natural objective function equivalent to the non-equilibrium entropy production in a steady state system as a driving force for the process dynamics. We illustrate how distributed control and optimization can be implemented into process network structures and how control laws and algorithms alter the system's natural equilibrium towards engineered objectives. The basic requirement is that the flow conditions can be expressed in terms of conic sector (passivity) conditions. Our formalism allows integration of fundamental conservation properties from topology with learned dynamic relations from data through sparse deep neural networks. We demonstrate in a practical example of a simple inventory control system how to integrate the basic topology of a process with a neural network ordinary differential equation model. The system specific constitutive equations are left undescribed and learned by the neural ordinary differential equation algorithm using the adjoint method in combination with an adaptive ODE solver from synthetic time-series data. The resulting neural network forms a state space model for use in e.g. a model predictive control algorithm.

Title: Pitch Accent Detection improves Pretrained Automatic Speech Recognition
Authors: David Sasu, Natalie Schluter
Abstract: We show the performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems that use semi-supervised speech representations can be boosted by a complimentary pitch accent detection module, by introducing a joint ASR and pitch accent detection model. The pitch accent detection component of our model achieves a significant improvement on the state-of-the-art for the task, closing the gap in F1-score by 41%. Additionally, the ASR performance in joint training decreases WER by 28.3% on LibriSpeech, under limited resource fine-tuning. With these results, we show the importance of extending pretrained speech models to retain or re-learn important prosodic cues such as pitch accent.

Title: Single-Step Reconstruction-Free Anomaly Detection and Segmentation via Diffusion Models
Authors: Mehrdad Moradi, Marco Grasso, Bianca Maria Colosimo, Kamran Paynabar
Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated significant success in anomaly detection and segmentation over the past decade. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and VAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on normal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a predefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The corresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse sampling. However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1) the reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple sampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or subtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal pattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate intermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and often assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in unsupervised settings. We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based diffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of reconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that reconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the diffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational efficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the MVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and statistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on MVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best model. Code available at: this https URL

Title: REINA: Regularized Entropy Information-Based Loss for Efficient Simultaneous Speech Translation
Authors: Nameer Hirschkind, Joseph Liu, Mahesh Kumar Nandwana, Xiao Yu
Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) systems stream in audio while simultaneously emitting translated text or speech. Such systems face the significant challenge of balancing translation quality and latency. We introduce a strategy to optimize this tradeoff: wait for more input only if you gain information by doing so. Based on this strategy, we present Regularized Entropy INformation Adaptation (REINA), a novel loss to train an adaptive policy using an existing non-streaming translation model. We derive REINA from information theory principles and show that REINA helps push the reported Pareto frontier of the latency/quality tradeoff over prior works. Utilizing REINA, we train a SimulST model on French, Spanish and German, both from and into English. Training on only open source or synthetically generated data, we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) streaming results for models of comparable size. We also introduce a metric for streaming efficiency, quantitatively showing REINA improves the latency/quality trade-off by as much as 21% compared to prior approaches, normalized against non-streaming baseline BLEU scores.

Title: RCUKF: Data-Driven Modeling Meets Bayesian Estimation
Authors: Kumar Anurag, Kasra Azizi, Francesco Sorrentino, Wenbin Wan
Abstract: Accurate modeling is crucial in many engineering and scientific applications, yet obtaining a reliable process model for complex systems is often challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, reservoir computing with unscented Kalman filtering (RCUKF), which integrates data-driven modeling via reservoir computing (RC) with Bayesian estimation through the unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The RC component learns the nonlinear system dynamics directly from data, serving as a surrogate process model in the UKF prediction step to generate state estimates in high-dimensional or chaotic regimes where nominal mathematical models may fail. Meanwhile, the UKF measurement update integrates real-time sensor data to correct potential drift in the data-driven model. We demonstrate RCUKF effectiveness on well-known benchmark problems and a real-time vehicle trajectory estimation task in a high-fidelity simulation environment.

Title: Towards Hallucination-Free Music: A Reinforcement Learning Preference Optimization Framework for Reliable Song Generation
Authors: Huaicheng Zhang, Wei Tan, Guangzheng Li, Yixuan Zhang, Hangting Chen, Shun Lei, Chenyu Yang, Zhiyong Wu, Shuai Wang, Qijun Huang, Dong Yu
Abstract: Recent advances in audio-based generative language models have accelerated AI-driven lyric-to-song generation. However, these models frequently suffer from content hallucination, producing outputs misaligned with the input lyrics and undermining musical coherence. Current supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approaches, limited by passive label-fitting, exhibit constrained self-improvement and poor hallucination mitigation. To address this core challenge, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework leveraging preference optimization for hallucination control. Our key contributions include: (1) Developing a robust hallucination preference dataset constructed via phoneme error rate (PER) computation and rule-based filtering to capture alignment with human expectations; (2) Implementing and evaluating three distinct preference optimization strategies within the RL framework: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). DPO operates off-policy to enhance positive token likelihood, achieving a significant 7.4% PER reduction. PPO and GRPO employ an on-policy approach, training a PER-based reward model to iteratively optimize sequences via reward maximization and KL-regularization, yielding PER reductions of 4.9% and 4.7%, respectively. Comprehensive objective and subjective evaluations confirm that our methods effectively suppress hallucinations while preserving musical quality. Crucially, this work presents a systematic, RL-based solution to hallucination control in lyric-to-song generation. The framework's transferability also unlocks potential for music style adherence and musicality enhancement, opening new avenues for future generative song research.

Title: AU-IQA: A Benchmark Dataset for Perceptual Quality Assessment of AI-Enhanced User-Generated Content
Authors: Shushi Wang, Chunyi Li, Zicheng Zhang, Han Zhou, Wei Dong, Jun Chen, Guangtao Zhai, Xiaohong Liu
Abstract: AI-based image enhancement techniques have been widely adopted in various visual applications, significantly improving the perceptual quality of user-generated content (UGC). However, the lack of specialized quality assessment models has become a significant limiting factor in this field, limiting user experience and hindering the advancement of enhancement methods. While perceptual quality assessment methods have shown strong performance on UGC and AIGC individually, their effectiveness on AI-enhanced UGC (AI-UGC) which blends features from both, remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we construct AU-IQA, a benchmark dataset comprising 4,800 AI-UGC images produced by three representative enhancement types which include super-resolution, low-light enhancement, and denoising. On this dataset, we further evaluate a range of existing quality assessment models, including traditional IQA methods and large multimodal models. Finally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of how well current approaches perform in assessing the perceptual quality of AI-UGC. The access link to the AU-IQA is this https URL.

Title: Phase Noise Tolerance for Low-Pilot-Overhead OFDM Terahertz Links Beyond 64-QAM
Authors: Bowen Liu, Takasumi Tanabe
Abstract: THz wireless communications have garnered significant attention due to their unprecedented data rates enabled by the abundant untapped spectrum. However, advanced modulation formats beyond 64-QAM remain largely unexplored, as phase errors introduced during up/down-conversion severely limit system performance. Particularly, OFDM transmission is highly susceptible to aggravated ICI induced by phase noise, undermining the orthogonality of subcarriers. While PLLs and pilot-assisted compensation can mitigate phase errors, excessive pilot overhead compromises spectral efficiency and energy consumption, and white phase noise remains unrecoverable. Therefore, quantifying phase noise tolerance is essential for practical physical layer protocols. Here, we reveal the impact of phase noise in a 64-QAM, 2048-subcarrier OFDM THz transmission system. 3{\sigma}-error estimation is proposed to quantify phase noise tolerance, indicating an intuitive EVM threshold of approximately 5%. This threshold further delineates the trade-offs among phase noise levels, SNR requirements, and pilot overhead. Moreover, by benchmarking representative oscillators with distinct phase noise spectra, microring resonators (MRRs) are identified as indispensable enablers for low-pilot-overhead OFDM THz links operating beyond 64-QAM.

Title: Energy Efficiency Optimization for Movable Antenna-Aided Communication Systems
Authors: Jingze Ding, Zijian Zhou, Yuping Zhao, Bingli Jiao
Abstract: This paper investigates the energy efficiency optimization for movable antenna (MA) systems by considering the time delay and energy consumption introduced by MA movement. We first derive the upper bound on energy efficiency for a single-user downlink communication system, where the user is equipped with a single MA. Then, the energy efficiency maximization problem is formulated to optimize the MA position, and an efficient algorithm based on successive convex approximation is proposed to solve this non-convex optimization problem. Simulation results show that, despite the overhead caused by MA movement, the MA system can still improve the energy efficiency compared to the conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) system.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is vital in domains where data sensitivity is paramount, such as finance and energy systems. While Differential Privacy (DP) provides theoretical guarantees to protect individual data contributions, its integration especially via DP-SGD often impairs model performance due to injected noise. In this paper, we propose Q-DPTS, a hybrid quantum-classical framework for Quantum Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting. Q-DPTS combines Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with per-sample gradient clipping and Gaussian noise injection, ensuring rigorous $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy. The expressiveness of quantum models enables improved robustness against the utility loss induced by DP mechanisms. We evaluate Q-DPTS on the ETT (Electricity Transformer Temperature) dataset, a standard benchmark for long-term time series forecasting. Our approach is compared against both classical and quantum baselines, including LSTM, QASA, QRWKV, and QLSTM. Results demonstrate that Q-DPTS consistently achieves lower prediction error under the same privacy budget, indicating a favorable privacy-utility trade-off. This work presents one of the first explorations into quantum-enhanced differentially private forecasting, offering promising directions for secure and accurate time series modeling in privacy-critical scenarios.

Title: Automatic Image Colorization with Convolutional Neural Networks and Generative Adversarial Networks
Authors: Ruiyu Li, Changyuan Qiu, Hangrui Cao, Qihan Ren, Yuqing Qiu
Abstract: Image colorization, the task of adding colors to grayscale images, has been the focus of significant research efforts in computer vision in recent years for its various application areas such as color restoration and automatic animation colorization [15, 1]. The colorization problem is challenging as it is highly ill-posed with two out of three image dimensions lost, resulting in large degrees of freedom. However, semantics of the scene as well as the surface texture could provide important cues for colors: the sky is typically blue, the clouds are typically white and the grass is typically green, and there are huge amounts of training data available for learning such priors since any colored image could serve as a training data point [20]. Colorization is initially formulated as a regression task[5], which ignores the multi-modal nature of color prediction. In this project, we explore automatic image colorization via classification and adversarial learning. We will build our models on prior works, apply modifications for our specific scenario and make comparisons.

Title: RAP: Real-time Audio-driven Portrait Animation with Video Diffusion Transformer
Authors: Fangyu Du, Taiqing Li, Ziwei Zhang, Qian Qiao, Tan Yu, Dingcheng Zhen, Xu Jia, Yang Yang, Shunshun Yin, Siyuan Liu
Abstract: Audio-driven portrait animation aims to synthesize realistic and natural talking head videos from an input audio signal and a single reference image. While existing methods achieve high-quality results by leveraging high-dimensional intermediate representations and explicitly modeling motion dynamics, their computational complexity renders them unsuitable for real-time deployment. Real-time inference imposes stringent latency and memory constraints, often necessitating the use of highly compressed latent representations. However, operating in such compact spaces hinders the preservation of fine-grained spatiotemporal details, thereby complicating audio-visual synchronization RAP (Real-time Audio-driven Portrait animation), a unified framework for generating high-quality talking portraits under real-time constraints. Specifically, RAP introduces a hybrid attention mechanism for fine-grained audio control, and a static-dynamic training-inference paradigm that avoids explicit motion supervision. Through these techniques, RAP achieves precise audio-driven control, mitigates long-term temporal drift, and maintains high visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves state-of-the-art performance while operating under real-time constraints.

Authors: Ali Raza, Muhammad Farhan Khan, Zeeshan Alam, Muhammad Saad, Ilyas Saleem, Muhammad Ahmed Mohsin, Muhammad Ali Jamshed
Abstract: This paper presents a joint framework that integrates reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) with Terahertz (THz) communications and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to enhance smart industrial communications. The proposed system leverages the advantages of RIS and THz bands to improve spectral efficiency, coverage, and reliability key requirements for industrial automation and real-time communications in future 6G networks and beyond. Within this framework, two power allocation strategies are investigated: the first optimally distributes power between near and far industrial nodes, and the second prioritizes network demands to enhance system performance further. A performance evaluation is conducted to compare the sum rate and outage probability against a fixed power allocation scheme. Our scheme achieves up to a 23% sum rate gain over fixed PA at 30 dBm. Simulation results validate the theoretical analysis, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the RIS-assisted NOMA MIMO framework for THz enabled industrial communications.

Title: SpectroStream: A Versatile Neural Codec for General Audio
Authors: Yunpeng Li, Kehang Han, Brian McWilliams, Zalan Borsos, Marco Tagliasacchi
Abstract: We propose SpectroStream, a full-band multi-channel neural audio codec. Successor to the well-established SoundStream, SpectroStream extends its capability beyond 24 kHz monophonic audio and enables high-quality reconstruction of 48 kHz stereo music at bit rates of 4--16 kbps. This is accomplished with a new neural architecture that leverages audio representation in the time-frequency domain, which leads to better audio quality especially at higher sample rate. The model also uses a delayed-fusion strategy to handle multi-channel audio, which is crucial in balancing per-channel acoustic quality and cross-channel phase consistency.

Title: Advanced Hybrid Transformer LSTM Technique with Attention and TS Mixer for Drilling Rate of Penetration Prediction
Authors: Saddam Hussain Khan (Artificial Intelligence Lab, Department of Computer Systems Engineering, University of Engineering and Applied Sciences (UEAS), Swat, Pakistan)
Abstract: The Rate of Penetration (ROP) is crucial for optimizing drilling operations; however, accurately predicting it is hindered by the complex, dynamic, and high-dimensional nature of drilling data. Traditional empirical, physics-based, and basic machine learning models often fail to capture intricate temporal and contextual relationships, resulting in suboptimal predictions and limited real-time utility. To address this gap, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning architecture integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Transformer encoders, Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) blocks, and attention mechanisms to synergistically model temporal dependencies, static feature interactions, global context, and dynamic feature importance. Evaluated on a real-world drilling dataset, our model outperformed benchmarks (standalone LSTM, TS-Mixer, and simpler hybrids) with an R-squared score of 0.9988 and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 1.447%, as measured by standard regression metrics (R-squared, MAE, RMSE, MAPE). Model interpretability was ensured using SHAP and LIME, while actual vs. predicted curves and bias checks confirmed accuracy and fairness across scenarios. This advanced hybrid approach enables reliable real-time ROP prediction, paving the way for intelligent, cost-effective drilling optimization systems with significant operational impact.

Title: Estimating Musical Surprisal from Audio in Autoregressive Diffusion Model Noise Spaces
Authors: Mathias Rose Bjare, Stefan Lattner, Gerhard Widmer
Abstract: Recently, the information content (IC) of predictions from a Generative Infinite-Vocabulary Transformer (GIVT) has been used to model musical expectancy and surprisal in audio. We investigate the effectiveness of such modelling using IC calculated with autoregressive diffusion models (ADMs). We empirically show that IC estimates of models based on two different diffusion ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describe diverse data better, in terms of negative log-likelihood, than a GIVT. We evaluate diffusion model IC's effectiveness in capturing surprisal aspects by examining two tasks: (1) capturing monophonic pitch surprisal, and (2) detecting segment boundaries in multi-track audio. In both tasks, the diffusion models match or exceed the performance of a GIVT. We hypothesize that the surprisal estimated at different diffusion process noise levels corresponds to the surprisal of music and audio features present at different audio granularities. Testing our hypothesis, we find that, for appropriate noise levels, the studied musical surprisal tasks' results improve. Code is provided on this http URL.

Title: A Multi-view Landmark Representation Approach with Application to GNSS-Visual-Inertial Odometry
Authors: Tong Hua, Jiale Han, Wei Ouyang
Abstract: Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) has been a significant technique in vision-aided sensor fusion. However, it usually suffers from high computational burden when jointly optimizing camera poses and the landmarks. To improve its efficiency and applicability for multi-sensor fusion, we present a multi-view pose-only estimation approach with its application to GNSS-Visual-Inertial Odometry (GVIO) in this paper. Our main contribution is deriving a visual measurement model which directly associates landmark representation with multiple camera poses and observations. Such a pose-only measurement is proven to be tightly-coupled between landmarks and poses, and maintain a perfect null space that is independent of estimated poses. Finally, we apply the proposed approach to a filter based GVIO with a novel feature management strategy. Both simulation tests and real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of efficiency and accuracy.

Title: A Scalable Pipeline for Enabling Non-Verbal Speech Generation and Understanding
Authors: Runchuan Ye, Yixuan Zhou, Renjie Yu, Zijian Lin, Kehan Li, Xiang Li, Xin Liu, Guoyang Zeng, Zhiyong Wu
Abstract: Human spoken communication involves not only lexical content but also non-verbal vocalizations (NVs) such as laughter, sighs, and coughs, which convey emotions, intentions, and social signals. However, most existing speech systems focus solely on verbal content and lack the ability to understand and generate such non-verbal cues, reducing the emotional intelligence and communicative richness of spoken interfaces. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{NonVerbalSpeech-38K}$, a large and diverse dataset for non-verbal speech generation and understanding, collected from real-world media and annotated using an automatic pipeline. The dataset contains 38,718 samples (about 131 hours) with 10 categories of non-verbal cues, such as laughter, sniff, and throat clearing. We further validate the dataset by fine-tuning state-of-the-art models, including F5-TTS and Qwen2-Audio, demonstrating its effectiveness in non-verbal speech generation and understanding tasks. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We propose a practical pipeline for building natural and diverse non-verbal speech datasets; (2) We release a large-scale dataset to advance research on non-verbal speech generation and understanding; (3) We validate the dataset's effectiveness by demonstrating improvements in both non-verbal speech synthesis and captioning, thereby facilitating richer human-computer interaction.

Title: From Detection to Correction: Backdoor-Resilient Face Recognition via Vision-Language Trigger Detection and Noise-Based Neutralization
Authors: Farah Wahida, M.A.P. Chamikara, Yashothara Shanmugarasa, Mohan Baruwal Chhetri, Thilina Ranbaduge, Ibrahim Khalil
Abstract: Biometric systems, such as face recognition systems powered by deep neural networks (DNNs), rely on large and highly sensitive datasets. Backdoor attacks can subvert these systems by manipulating the training process. By inserting a small trigger, such as a sticker, make-up, or patterned mask, into a few training images, an adversary can later present the same trigger during authentication to be falsely recognized as another individual, thereby gaining unauthorized access. Existing defense mechanisms against backdoor attacks still face challenges in precisely identifying and mitigating poisoned images without compromising data utility, which undermines the overall reliability of the system. We propose a novel and generalizable approach, TrueBiometric: Trustworthy Biometrics, which accurately detects poisoned images using a majority voting mechanism leveraging multiple state-of-the-art large vision language models. Once identified, poisoned samples are corrected using targeted and calibrated corrective noise. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate that TrueBiometric detects and corrects poisoned images with 100\% accuracy without compromising accuracy on clean images. Compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches, TrueBiometric offers a more practical, accurate, and effective solution for mitigating backdoor attacks in face recognition systems.

Title: F2PASeg: Feature Fusion for Pituitary Anatomy Segmentation in Endoscopic Surgery
Authors: Lumin Chen, Zhiying Wu, Tianye Lei, Xuexue Bai, Ming Feng, Yuxi Wang, Gaofeng Meng, Zhen Lei, Hongbin Liu
Abstract: Pituitary tumors often cause deformation or encapsulation of adjacent vital structures. Anatomical structure segmentation can provide surgeons with early warnings of regions that pose surgical risks, thereby enhancing the safety of pituitary surgery. However, pixel-level annotated video stream datasets for pituitary surgeries are extremely rare. To address this challenge, we introduce a new dataset for Pituitary Anatomy Segmentation (PAS). PAS comprises 7,845 time-coherent images extracted from 120 videos. To mitigate class imbalance, we apply data augmentation techniques that simulate the presence of surgical instruments in the training data. One major challenge in pituitary anatomy segmentation is the inconsistency in feature representation due to occlusions, camera motion, and surgical bleeding. By incorporating a Feature Fusion module, F2PASeg is proposed to refine anatomical structure segmentation by leveraging both high-resolution image features and deep semantic embeddings, enhancing robustness against intraoperative variations. Experimental results demonstrate that F2PASeg consistently segments critical anatomical structures in real time, providing a reliable solution for intraoperative pituitary surgery planning.

Title: Distributionally Robust System Level Synthesis With Output Feedback Affine Control Policy
Authors: Yun Li, Jicheng Shi, Colin N. Jones, Neil Yorke-Smith, Tamas Keviczky
Abstract: This paper studies the finite-horizon robust optimal control of linear systems subject to model mismatch and additive stochastic disturbances. Utilizing the system level synthesis (SLS) parameterization, we propose a novel SLS design using output-feedback affine control policy and extend it to a distributionally robust setting to improve system resilience by minimizing the cost function while ensuring constraint satisfaction against the worst-case uncertainty distribution. The scopes of model mismatch and stochastic disturbances are quantified using the 1-norm and a Wasserstein metric-based ambiguity set, respectively. For the closed-loop dynamics, we analyze the distributional shift between the predicted output-input response -- computed using nominal parameters and empirical disturbance samples -- and the actual closed-loop distribution, highlighting its dependence on model mismatch and SLS parameterization. Assuming convex and Lipschitz continuous cost functions and constraints, we derive a tractable reformulation of the distributionally robust SLS (DR-SLS) problem by leveraging tools from robust control and distributionally robust optimization (DRO). Numerical experiments validate the performance and robustness of the proposed approach.

Title: Embedding Alignment in Code Generation for Audio
Authors: Sam Kouteili, Hiren Madhu, George Typaldos, Mark Santolucito
Abstract: LLM-powered code generation has the potential to revolutionize creative coding endeavors, such as live-coding, by enabling users to focus on structural motifs over syntactic details. In such domains, when prompting an LLM, users may benefit from considering multiple varied code candidates to better realize their musical intentions. Code generation models, however, struggle to present unique and diverse code candidates, with no direct insight into the code's audio output. To better establish a relationship between code candidates and produced audio, we investigate the topology of the mapping between code and audio embedding spaces. We find that code and audio embeddings do not exhibit a simple linear relationship, but supplement this with a constructed predictive model that shows an embedding alignment map could be learned. Supplementing the aim for musically diverse output, we present a model that given code predicts output audio embedding, constructing a code-audio embedding alignment map.

Title: Keep It Real: Challenges in Attacking Compression-Based Adversarial Purification
Authors: Samuel Räber, Till Aczel, Andreas Plesner, Roger Wattenhofer
Abstract: Previous work has suggested that preprocessing images through lossy compression can defend against adversarial perturbations, but comprehensive attack evaluations have been lacking. In this paper, we construct strong white-box and adaptive attacks against various compression models and identify a critical challenge for attackers: high realism in reconstructed images significantly increases attack difficulty. Through rigorous evaluation across multiple attack scenarios, we demonstrate that compression models capable of producing realistic, high-fidelity reconstructions are substantially more resistant to our attacks. In contrast, low-realism compression models can be broken. Our analysis reveals that this is not due to gradient masking. Rather, realistic reconstructions maintaining distributional alignment with natural images seem to offer inherent robustness. This work highlights a significant obstacle for future adversarial attacks and suggests that developing more effective techniques to overcome realism represents an essential challenge for comprehensive security evaluation.

Title: SPGISpeech 2.0: Transcribed multi-speaker financial audio for speaker-tagged transcription
Authors: Raymond Grossman, Taejin Park, Kunal Dhawan, Andrew Titus, Sophia Zhi, Yulia Shchadilova, Weiqing Wang, Jagadeesh Balam, Boris Ginsburg
Abstract: We introduce SPGISpeech 2.0, a dataset suitable for speaker-tagged transcription in the financial domain. SPGISpeech 2.0 improves the diversity of applicable modeling tasks while maintaining the core characteristic of the original SPGISpeech dataset: audio snippets and their corresponding fully formatted text transcriptions, usable for end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR). SPGISpeech 2.0 consists of 3,780 additional hours of professionally transcribed earnings calls. Furthermore, the dataset contains call and speaker information for each audio snippet facilitating multi-talker ASR. We validate the utility of SPGISpeech 2.0 through improvements in speaker-tagged ASR performance of popular speech recognition models after fine-tuning on SPGISpeech 2.0. Released free for non-commercial use, we expect SPGISpeech 2.0 to foster advancements in speech recognition technologies and inspire a wide range of research applications.

Title: Joint parameter estimation and multidimensional reconciliation for CV-QKD
Authors: Jisheng Dai, Xue-Qin Jiang, Peng Huang, Tao Wang, Guihua Zeng
Abstract: Accurate quantum channel parameter estimation is essential for effective information reconciliation in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD). However, conventional maximum likelihood (ML) estimators rely on a large amount of discarded data (or pilot symbols), leading to a significant loss in symbol efficiency. Moreover, the separation between the estimation and reconciliation phases can introduce error propagation. In this paper, we propose a novel joint message-passing scheme that unifies channel parameter estimation and information reconciliation within a Bayesian framework. By leveraging the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, the proposed method simultaneously estimates unknown parameters during decoding, eliminating the need for separate ML estimation. Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid multidimensional rotation scheme that removes the requirement for norm feedback, significantly reducing classical channel overhead. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to unify multidimensional reconciliation and channel parameter estimation in CV-QKD, providing a practical solution for high-efficiency reconciliation with minimal pilots.

Title: Latency Minimization for Multi-AAV-Enabled ISCC Systems with Movable Antenna
Authors: Yiyang Chen, Wenchao Liu, Chunjie Wang, Yinyu Wu, Xuhui Zhang, Yanyan Shen
Abstract: This paper investigates an autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV)-enabled integrated sensing, communication, and computation system, with a particular focus on integrating movable antennas (MAs) into the system for enhancing overall system performance. Specifically, multiple MA-enabled AVVs perform sensing tasks and simultaneously transmit the generated computational tasks to the base station for processing. To minimize the maximum latency under the sensing and resource constraints, we formulate an optimization problem that jointly coordinates the position of the MAs, the computation resource allocation, and the transmit beamforming. Due to the non-convexity of the objective function and strong coupling among variables, we propose a two-layer iterative algorithm leveraging particle swarm optimization and convex optimization to address it. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves significant latency improvements compared to the baseline schemes.

Title: Design and Analysis of a Vanadium Dioxide-Based Ultra-Broadband Terahertz Metamaterial Absorber
Authors: Robiul Hasan, Nafisa Anjum
Abstract: This paper presents a VO2-based metamaterial absorber optimized for ultra-broadband, polarization-insensitive performance in the terahertz (THz) frequency range. The absorber consists of a patterned VO2 metasurface, a low-loss MF2 dielectric spacer, and a gold ground plane. Exploiting the phase transition of VO2, the design enables dynamic control of electromagnetic absorption. Full-wave simulations show an average absorptance of 98.15% across a 5.38THz bandwidth (5.72-11.11THz) and over 99% absorption sustained across 3.35THz. The absorber maintains stable performance for varying polarization angles and both TE and TM modes under oblique incidence. Impedance analysis confirms strong matching to free space, reducing reflection and eliminating transmission. Parametric analysis investigates the influence of VO2 conductivity, MF2 thickness, and unit cell periodicity on performance. Compared to recent THz metamaterial absorbers, the proposed design achieves broader bandwidth, higher efficiency, and simpler implementation. These characteristics make it suitable for THz sensing, imaging, wireless communication, and adaptive photonic systems, and position it as a promising platform for tunable and reconfigurable THz modules.

Title: Towards Generalizable Safety in Crowd Navigation via Conformal Uncertainty Handling
Authors: Jianpeng Yao, Xiaopan Zhang, Yu Xia, Zejin Wang, Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury, Jiachen Li
Abstract: Mobile robots navigating in crowds trained using reinforcement learning are known to suffer performance degradation when faced with out-of-distribution scenarios. We propose that by properly accounting for the uncertainties of pedestrians, a robot can learn safe navigation policies that are robust to distribution shifts. Our method augments agent observations with prediction uncertainty estimates generated by adaptive conformal inference, and it uses these estimates to guide the agent's behavior through constrained reinforcement learning. The system helps regulate the agent's actions and enables it to adapt to distribution shifts. In the in-distribution setting, our approach achieves a 96.93% success rate, which is over 8.80% higher than the previous state-of-the-art baselines with over 3.72 times fewer collisions and 2.43 times fewer intrusions into ground-truth human future trajectories. In three out-of-distribution scenarios, our method shows much stronger robustness when facing distribution shifts in velocity variations, policy changes, and transitions from individual to group dynamics. We deploy our method on a real robot, and experiments show that the robot makes safe and robust decisions when interacting with both sparse and dense crowds.

Title: PESTO: Pitch Estimation with Self-supervised Transposition-equivariant Objective
Authors: Alain Riou, Stefan Lattner, Gaëtan Hadjeres, Geoffroy Peeters
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of pitch estimation using Self Supervised Learning (SSL). The SSL paradigm we use is equivariance to pitch transposition, which enables our model to accurately perform pitch estimation on monophonic audio after being trained only on a small unlabeled dataset. We use a lightweight ($<$ 30k parameters) Siamese neural network that takes as inputs two different pitch-shifted versions of the same audio represented by its Constant-Q Transform. To prevent the model from collapsing in an encoder-only setting, we propose a novel class-based transposition-equivariant objective which captures pitch information. Furthermore, we design the architecture of our network to be transposition-preserving by introducing learnable Toeplitz matrices. We evaluate our model for the two tasks of singing voice and musical instrument pitch estimation and show that our model is able to generalize across tasks and datasets while being lightweight, hence remaining compatible with low-resource devices and suitable for real-time applications. In particular, our results surpass self-supervised baselines and narrow the performance gap between self-supervised and supervised methods for pitch estimation.

Title: Beyond Subspace Isolation: Many-to-Many Transformer for Light Field Image Super-resolution
Authors: Zeke Zexi Hu, Xiaoming Chen, Vera Yuk Ying Chung, Yiran Shen
Abstract: The effective extraction of spatial-angular features plays a crucial role in light field image super-resolution (LFSR) tasks, and the introduction of convolution and Transformers leads to significant improvement in this area. Nevertheless, due to the large 4D data volume of light field images, many existing methods opted to decompose the data into a number of lower-dimensional subspaces and perform Transformers in each sub-space individually. As a side effect, these methods inadvertently restrict the self-attention mechanisms to a One-to-One scheme accessing only a limited subset of LF data, explicitly preventing comprehensive optimization on all spatial and angular cues. In this paper, we identify this limitation as subspace isolation and introduce a novel Many-to-Many Transformer (M2MT) to address it. M2MT aggregates angular information in the spatial subspace before performing the self-attention mechanism. It enables complete access to all information across all sub-aperture images (SAIs) in a light field image. Consequently, M2MT is enabled to comprehensively capture long-range correlation dependencies. With M2MT as the foundational component, we develop a simple yet effective M2MT network for LFSR. Our experimental results demonstrate that M2MT achieves state-of-the-art performance across various public datasets, and it offers a favorable balance between model performance and efficiency, yielding higher-quality LFSR results with substantially lower demand for memory and computation. We further conduct in-depth analysis using local attribution maps (LAM) to obtain visual interpretability, and the results validate that M2MT is empowered with a truly non-local context in both spatial and angular subspaces to mitigate subspace isolation and acquire effective spatial-angular representation.

Title: A dataset of primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma MRI with multi-modalities segmentation
Authors: Yin Li, Qi Chen, Kai Wang, Meige Li, Liping Si, Yingwei Guo, Yu Xiong, Qixing Wang, Yang Qin, Ling Xu, Patrick van der Smagt, Jun Tang, Nutan Chen
Abstract: Multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) data facilitate the early diagnosis, tumor segmentation, and disease staging in the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The lack of publicly available, comprehensive datasets limits advancements in diagnosis, treatment planning, and the development of machine learning algorithms for NPC. Addressing this critical need, we introduce the first comprehensive NPC MRI dataset, encompassing MR axial imaging of 277 primary NPC patients. This dataset includes T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences, totaling 831 scans. In addition to the corresponding clinical data, manually annotated and labeled segmentations by experienced radiologists offer high-quality data resources from untreated primary NPC.

Title: Shadow Area and Degrees of Freedom for Free-Space Communication
Authors: Mats Gustafsson
Abstract: The number of degrees of freedom (NDoF) in a communication channel fundamentally limits the number of independent spatial modes available for transmitting and receiving information. Although the NDoF can be computed numerically for specific configurations using singular value decomposition (SVD) of the channel operator, this approach provides limited physical insight. In this paper, we introduce a simple analytical estimate for the NDoF between arbitrarily shaped transmitter and receiver regions in free space. In the electrically large limit, where the NDoF is high, it is well approximated by the mutual shadow area, measured in units of wavelength squared. This area corresponds to the projected overlap of the regions, integrated over all lines of sight, and captures their effective spatial coupling. The proposed estimate generalizes and unifies several previously established results, including those based on Weyl's law, shadow area, and the paraxial approximation. We analyze several example configurations to illustrate the accuracy of the estimate and validate it through comparisons with numerical SVD computations of the propagation channel. The results provide both practical tools and physical insight for the design and analysis of high-capacity communication and sensing systems.

Title: Online Graph Topology Learning via Time-Vertex Adaptive Filters: From Theory to Cardiac Fibrillation
Authors: Alexander Jenkins, Thiernithi Variddhisai, Ahmed El-Medany, Fu Siong Ng, Danilo Mandic
Abstract: Graph Signal Processing (GSP) provides a powerful framework for analysing complex, interconnected systems by modelling data as signals on graphs. While recent advances have enabled graph topology learning from observed signals, existing methods often struggle with time-varying systems and real-time applications. To address this gap, we introduce AdaCGP, a sparsity-aware adaptive algorithm for dynamic graph topology estimation from multivariate time series. AdaCGP estimates the Graph Shift Operator (GSO) through recursive update formulae designed to address sparsity, shift-invariance, and bias. Through comprehensive simulations, we demonstrate that AdaCGP consistently outperforms multiple baselines across diverse graph topologies, achieving improvements exceeding 83% in GSO estimation compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining favourable computational scaling properties. Our variable splitting approach enables reliable identification of causal connections with near-zero false alarm rates and minimal missed edges. Applied to cardiac fibrillation recordings, AdaCGP tracks dynamic changes in propagation patterns more effectively than established methods like Granger causality, capturing temporal variations in graph topology that static approaches miss. The algorithm successfully identifies stability characteristics in conduction patterns that may maintain arrhythmias, demonstrating potential for clinical applications in diagnosis and treatment of complex biomedical systems.

Title: STARFormer: A Novel Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Reorganization Transformer of FMRI for Brain Disorder Diagnosis
Authors: Wenhao Dong, Yueyang Li, Weiming Zeng, Lei Chen, Hongjie Yan, Wai Ting Siok, Nizhuan Wang
Abstract: Many existing methods that use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) classify brain disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), often overlook the integration of spatial and temporal dependencies of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which may lead to inaccurate or imprecise classification results. To solve this problem, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Aggregation eorganization ransformer (STARFormer) that effectively captures both spatial and temporal features of BOLD signals by incorporating three key modules. The region of interest (ROI) spatial structure analysis module uses eigenvector centrality (EC) to reorganize brain regions based on effective connectivity, highlighting critical spatial relationships relevant to the brain disorder. The temporal feature reorganization module systematically segments the time series into equal-dimensional window tokens and captures multiscale features through variable window and cross-window attention. The spatio-temporal feature fusion module employs a parallel transformer architecture with dedicated temporal and spatial branches to extract integrated features. The proposed STARFormer has been rigorously evaluated on two publicly available datasets for the classification of ASD and ADHD. The experimental results confirm that the STARFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, providing a more accurate and reliable tool for the diagnosis of brain disorders and biomedical research.

Title: On the effects of angular acceleration in orientation estimation using inertial measurement units
Authors: Felix Brändle, David Meister, Marc Seidel, Robin Strässer, Frank Allgöwer
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the orientation estimation problem using inertial measurement units. Many estimation algorithms suffer degraded performance when accelerations other than gravity affect the accelerometer. We show that linear accelerations resulting from rotational accelerations cannot be treated as external disturbance to be attenuated, rather, they change the dynamic behavior of the filter itself. In particular, this results in the introduction of additional zeros in the linearized transfer functions. These zeros lead to nonminimum phase behavior, which is known to be challenging for control. We validate these findings experimentally. Further, we demonstrate that Mahony and Madgwick filters can attenuate the acceleration at the expense of reduced bandwidth. In addition, we show that validation schemes based on precollected data fail to capture these closed-loop effects accurately.

Title: GNN-Enhanced Fault Diagnosis Method for Parallel Cyber-physical Attacks in Power Grids
Authors: Junhao Ren, Kai Zhao, Guangxiao Zhang, Xinghua Liu, Chao Zhai, Gaoxi Xiao
Abstract: Parallel cyber-physical attacks (PCPA) simultaneously damage physical transmission lines and block measurement data transmission in power grids, impairing or delaying system protection and recovery. This paper investigates the fault diagnosis problem for a linearized (DC) power flow model under PCPA. The physical attack mechanism includes not only line disconnection but also admittance modification, for example via compromised distributed flexible AC transmission system (D-FACTS) devices. To address this problem, we propose a fault diagnosis framework based on meta-mixed-integer programming (MMIP), integrating graph attention network-based fault localization (GAT-FL). First, we derive measurement reconstruction conditions that allow reconstructing unknown measurements in attacked areas from available measurements and the system topology. Based on these conditions, we formulate the diagnosis task as an MMIP model. The GAT-FL predicts a probability distribution over potential physical attacks, which is then incorporated as objective coefficients in the MMIP. Solving the MMIP yields optimal attack location and magnitude estimates, from which the system states are also reconstructed. Experimental simulations are conducted on IEEE 30/118 bus standard test cases to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis algorithms.

Title: Maximum Likelihood Estimation Based Complex-Valued Robust Chinese Remainder Theorem and Its Fast Algorithm
Authors: Xiaoping Li, Shiyang Sun, Qunying Liao, Xiang-Gen Xia
Abstract: Recently, a multi-channel self-reset analog-to-digital converter (ADC) system with complex-valued moduli has been proposed. This system enables the recovery of high dynamic range complex-valued bandlimited signals at low sampling rates via the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT). In this paper, we investigate complex-valued CRT (C-CRT) with erroneous remainders, where the errors follow wrapped complex Gaussian distributions. Based on the existing real-valued CRT utilizing maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), we propose a fast MLE-based C-CRT (MLE C-CRT). The proposed algorithm requires only $2L$ searches to obtain the optimal estimate of the common remainder, where $L$ is the number of moduli. Once the common remainder is estimated, the complex number can be determined using the C-CRT. Furthermore, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the fast MLE C-CRT to achieve robust estimation. Finally, we apply the proposed algorithm to ADCs. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing methods.

Authors: Shuting Wu, Yifei Wang, Jingzhe Wang, Apostolos I. Rikos, Xu Du
Abstract: Moving Horizon Estimation~(MHE) is essentially an optimization-based approach designed to estimate the states of dynamic systems within a moving time horizon. Traditional MHE solutions become computationally prohibitive due to the \textit{curse of dimensionality} arising from increasing problem complexity and growing length of time horizon. To address this issue, we propose novel computationally efficient algorithms for solving nonlinear MHE problems. Specifically, we first introduce a distributed reformulation utilizing a time-splitting technique. Leveraging this reformulation, we develop the Efficient Gauss-Newton Augmented Lagrangian Alternating Direction Inexact Newton (ALADIN) to achieve computational efficiency. Additionally, to accommodate limited computational capabilities inherent in some sub-problem solvers, we propose the Efficient Sensitivity Assisted ALADIN, which enables sub-problems to be solved inexactly without hindering computational efficiency. Furthermore, recognizing scenarios where sub-problem solvers possess no computational power, we propose a Distributed Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) that relies solely on first- and second-order information of local objective functions. We demonstrate the performance and advantages of our proposed methods through numerical experiments on differential drive robots case, a practical nonlinear MHE problem. Our results demonstrate that the three proposed algorithms achieve computational efficiency while preserving high accuracy, thereby satisfying the real-time requirements of MHE.

Title: Data-Driven Distributed Output Synchronization of Heterogeneous Discrete-Time Multi-Agent Systems
Authors: Giulio Fattore, Maria Elena Valcher
Abstract: In this paper, we assume that an autonomous exosystem generates a reference output, and we consider the problem of designing a distributed data-driven control law for a family of discrete-time heterogeneous LTI agents, connected through a directed graph, in order to synchronize the agents' outputs to the reference one. The agents of the network are split into two categories: leaders, with direct access to the exosystem output, and followers, that only receive information from their neighbors. All agents aim to achieve output synchronization by means of a state feedback that makes use of their own states as well as of an estimate of the exogenous system state, provided by an internal state observer. Such observer has a different structure for leaders and followers. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution are first derived in the model-based set-up and then in a data-driven context. An example illustrates both the implementation procedure and the performance of the proposed approach.

Title: Low-Complexity Optimization of Antenna Switching Schemes for Dynamic Channel Sounding
Authors: Juan Sanchez, Xuesong Cai, Ali Al-Ameri, Fredrik Tufvesson
Abstract: Understanding wireless channels is crucial for the design of wireless systems. For mobile communication, sounders and antenna arrays with short measurement times are required to simultaneously capture the dynamic and spatial channel characteristics. Switched antenna arrays are an attractive option that can overcome the high cost of real arrays and the long measurement times of virtual arrays. Optimization of the switching sequences is then essential to avoid aliasing and increase the accuracy of channel parameter estimates. This paper provides a novel and comprehensive analysis of the design of switching sequences. We first review the conventional spatio-temporal ambiguity function, extend it to dual-polarized antenna arrays, and analyze its prohibitive complexity when applied to ultra-massive antenna arrays. We thus propose a new method that uses the Fisher information matrix to tackle the estimation accuracy. We also propose to minimize the ambiguity by choosing a switching sequence that minimizes side lobes in its Fourier spectrum. In this sense, we divide the sequence design problem into Fourier-based ambiguity reduction and Fisher-based accuracy improvement, and coin the resulting design approach as Fourier-Fisher. Simulations and measurements show that the Fourier-Fisher approach achieves identical performance and significantly lower computational complexity than that of the conventional ambiguity-based approach.

Title: Multi-dimensional Parameter Estimation in RIS-aided MU-MIMO Channels
Authors: Linlin Mo, Yi Song, Fabio Saggese, Xinhua Lu, Zhongyong Wang, Petar Popovski
Abstract: We address the channel estimation problem in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided broadband systems by proposing a dual-structure and multi-dimensional transformations (DS-MDT) algorithm. The proposed approach leverages the dual-structure features of the channel parameters to assist users experiencing weaker channel conditions, thereby enhancing estimation performance. Moreover, given that the channel parameters are distributed across multiple dimensions of the received tensor, the proposed algorithm employs multi-dimensional transformations to effectively isolate and extract distinct parameters. The numerical results demonstrate the proposed algorithm reduces the normalized mean square error (NMSE) by up to 10 dB while maintaining lower complexity compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Robust Beamforming Design for STAR-RIS Aided RSMA Network with Hardware Impairments
Authors: Ziyue Wang, Xiaoyan Ma, Xingyu Peng, Zheao Li, Jinyuan Liu, Yongliang Guan, Chau Yuen
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the robust beamforming design for a simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) aided downlink rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) communication system, where both transceivers and STAR-RIS suffer from the impact of hardware impairments (HWI).A base station (BS) is deployed to transmit messages concurrently to multiple users, utilizing a STAR-RIS to improve communication quality and expand user coverage. We aim to maximize the achievable sum rate of the users while ensuring the constraints of transmit power, STAR-RIS coefficients, and the actual rate of the common stream for all users. To solve this challenging high-coupling and non-convexity problem, we adopt a fractional programming (FP)-based alternating optimization (AO) approach, where each sub-problem is addressed via successive convex approximation (SCA) and penalty function (PF) methods. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms other multiple access schemes and conventional passive RIS in terms of the achievable sum rate. Additionally, considering the HWI of the transceiver and STAR-RIS makes our algorithm more robust than when such considerations are not included.

Title: Brain Network Analysis Based on Fine-tuned Self-supervised Model for Brain Disease Diagnosis
Authors: Yifei Tang, Hongjie Jiang, Changhong Jing, Hieu Pham, Shuqiang Wang
Abstract: Functional brain network analysis has become an indispensable tool for brain disease analysis. It is profoundly impacted by deep learning methods, which can characterize complex connections between ROIs. However, the research on foundation models of brain network is limited and constrained to a single dimension, which restricts their extensive application in neuroscience. In this study, we propose a fine-tuned brain network model for brain disease diagnosis. It expands brain region representations across multiple dimensions based on the original brain network model, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Our model consists of two key modules: (1)an adapter module that expands brain region features across different dimensions. (2)a fine-tuned foundation brain network model, based on self-supervised learning and pre-trained on fMRI data from thousands of participants. Specifically, its transformer block is able to effectively extract brain region features and compute the inter-region associations. Moreover, we derive a compact latent representation of the brain network for brain disease diagnosis. Our downstream experiments in this study demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance in brain disease diagnosis, which potentially offers a promising approach in brain network analysis research.

Title: ZipVoice: Fast and High-Quality Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech with Flow Matching
Authors: Han Zhu, Wei Kang, Zengwei Yao, Liyong Guo, Fangjun Kuang, Zhaoqing Li, Weiji Zhuang, Long Lin, Daniel Povey
Abstract: Existing large-scale zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) models deliver high speech quality but suffer from slow inference speeds due to massive parameters. To address this issue, this paper introduces ZipVoice, a high-quality flow-matching-based zero-shot TTS model with a compact model size and fast inference speed. Key designs include: 1) a Zipformer-based vector field estimator to maintain adequate modeling capabilities under constrained size; 2) Average upsampling-based initial speech-text alignment and Zipformer-based text encoder to improve speech intelligibility; 3) A flow distillation method to reduce sampling steps and eliminate the inference overhead associated with classifier-free guidance. Experiments on 100k hours multilingual datasets show that ZipVoice matches state-of-the-art models in speech quality, while being 3 times smaller and up to 30 times faster than a DiT-based flow-matching baseline. Codes, model checkpoints and demo samples are publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Skew-Induced Insertion Loss Deviation (SILD) and FOM_SILD: Metrics for Quantifying P/N Skew Effects in High-Speed Channels
Authors: David Nozadze, Zurab Kiguradze, Amendra Koul, Mike Sapozhnikov
Abstract: The rise of AI workloads and growing data center demands have driven the need for ultra-high-speed interconnects exceeding 200 Gb/s. As unit intervals (UI) shrink, even a few picoseconds of P/N skew can degrade serializer-deserializer (SerDes) performance. Traditional methods for quantifying skew fall short in capturing its impact. We introduce two new metrics: 1) Skew-Induced Insertion Loss Deviation (SILD) and 2) its complementary Figure of Merit (FOM_SILD), analytically developed to assess P/N skew effects. Measured S-parameters confirm FOM_SILD reciprocity, while simulations of 224G PAM4 SerDes show strong correlation with bit error rate (BER) trends. This approach offers a robust framework for analyzing skew in next-generation ultra-high-speed interconnects.

Title: Capsule-ConvKAN: A Hybrid Neural Approach to Medical Image Classification
Authors: Laura Pituková, Peter Sinčák, László József Kovács, Peng Wang
Abstract: This study conducts a comprehensive comparison of four neural network architectures: Convolutional Neural Network, Capsule Network, Convolutional Kolmogorov-Arnold Network, and the newly proposed Capsule-Convolutional Kolmogorov-Arnold Network. The proposed Capsule-ConvKAN architecture combines the dynamic routing and spatial hierarchy capabilities of Capsule Network with the flexible and interpretable function approximation of Convolutional Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. This novel hybrid model was developed to improve feature representation and classification accuracy, particularly in challenging real-world biomedical image data. The architectures were evaluated on a histopathological image dataset, where Capsule-ConvKAN achieved the highest classification performance with an accuracy of 91.21%. The results demonstrate the potential of the newly introduced Capsule-ConvKAN in capturing spatial patterns, managing complex features, and addressing the limitations of traditional convolutional models in medical image classification.

Title: Constructed Realities? Technical and Contextual Anomalies in a High-Profile Image
Authors: Matthias Wjst
Abstract: This study offers a forensic assessment of a widely circulated photograph featuring Prince Andrew, Virginia Giuffre, and Ghislaine Maxwell - an image that has played a pivotal role in public discourse and legal narratives. Through analysis of multiple published versions, several inconsistencies are identified, including irregularities in lighting, posture, and physical interaction, which are more consistent with digital compositing than with an unaltered snapshot. While the absence of the original negative and a verifiable audit trail precludes definitive conclusions, the technical and contextual anomalies suggest that the image may have been deliberately constructed. Nevertheless, without additional evidence, the photograph remains an unresolved but symbolically charged fragment within a complex story of abuse, memory, and contested truth.

Authors: Oliullah Samir
Abstract: Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites are essential for providing accurate navigation and timing information worldwide. Operating in medium Earth orbit (MEO), these satellites must maintain precise Earth-pointing attitudes to transmit signals effectively. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the operational dynamics, attitude determination and control systems (ADCS), and orbital insertion techniques for GPS satellites. We explore the integration of sensors and actuators, control algorithms, stabilization strategies, and the launch procedures required to deploy these satellites. Key equations related to orbital mechanics and attitude control are discussed, and references to recent technical literature are included.

Title: Optimizing Preventive and Reactive Defense Resource Allocation with Uncertain Sensor Signals
Authors: Faezeh Shojaeighadikolaei, Shouhuai Xu, Keith Paarporn
Abstract: Cyber attacks continue to be a cause of concern despite advances in cyber defense techniques. Although cyber attacks cannot be fully prevented, standard decision-making frameworks typically focus on how to prevent them from succeeding, without considering the cost of cleaning up the damages incurred by successful attacks. This motivates us to investigate a new resource allocation problem formulated in this paper: The defender must decide how to split its investment between preventive defenses, which aim to harden nodes from attacks, and reactive defenses, which aim to quickly clean up the compromised nodes. This encounters a challenge imposed by the uncertainty associated with the observation, or sensor signal, whether a node is truly compromised or not; this uncertainty is real because attack detectors are not perfect. We investigate how the quality of sensor signals impacts the defender's strategic investment in the two types of defense, and ultimately the level of security that can be achieved. In particular, we show that the optimal investment in preventive resources increases, and thus reactive resource investment decreases, with higher sensor quality. We also show that the defender's performance improvement, relative to a baseline of no sensors employed, is maximal when the attacker can only achieve low attack success probabilities.

Title: WiFo-CF: Wireless Foundation Model for CSI Feedback
Authors: Xuanyu Liu, Shijian Gao, Boxun Liu, Xiang Cheng, Liuqing Yang
Abstract: Deep learning-based channel state information (CSI) feedback schemes demonstrate strong compression capabilities but are typically constrained to fixed system configurations, limiting their generalization and flexibility. To address this challenge, WiFo-CF, a novel wireless foundation model tailored for CSI feedback, is proposed, uniquely accommodating heterogeneous configurations such as varying channel dimensions, feedback rates, and data distributions within a unified framework through its key innovations: (1) a multi-user, multi-rate self-supervised pre-training strategy; and (2) a Mixture of Shared and Routed Expert (S-R MoE) architecture. Supporting the large-scale pre-training of WiFo-CF is the first heterogeneous channel feedback dataset, whose diverse patterns enable the model to achieve superior performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data across simulated and real-world scenarios. Furthermore, the learned representations effectively facilitate adaptation to downstream tasks such as CSI-based indoor localization, validating WiFo-CF's scalability and deployment potential.

Title: UniTalker: Conversational Speech-Visual Synthesis
Authors: Yifan Hu, Rui Liu, Yi Ren, Xiang Yin, Haizhou Li
Abstract: Conversational Speech Synthesis (CSS) is a key task in the user-agent interaction area, aiming to generate more expressive and empathetic speech for users. However, it is well-known that "listening" and "eye contact" play crucial roles in conveying emotions during real-world interpersonal communication. Existing CSS research is limited to perceiving only text and speech within the dialogue context, which restricts its effectiveness. Moreover, speech-only responses further constrain the interactive experience. To address these limitations, we introduce a Conversational Speech-Visual Synthesis (CSVS) task as an extension of traditional CSS. By leveraging multimodal dialogue context, it provides users with coherent audiovisual responses. To this end, we develop a CSVS system named UniTalker, which is a unified model that seamlessly integrates multimodal perception and multimodal rendering capabilities. Specifically, it leverages a large-scale language model to comprehensively understand multimodal cues in the dialogue context, including speaker, text, speech, and the talking-face animations. After that, it employs multi-task sequence prediction to first infer the target utterance's emotion and then generate empathetic speech and natural talking-face animations. To ensure that the generated speech-visual content remains consistent in terms of emotion, content, and duration, we introduce three key optimizations: 1) Designing a specialized neural landmark codec to tokenize and reconstruct facial expression sequences. 2) Proposing a bimodal speech-visual hard alignment decoding strategy. 3) Applying emotion-guided rendering during the generation stage. Comprehensive objective and subjective experiments demonstrate that our model synthesizes more empathetic speech and provides users with more natural and emotionally consistent talking-face animations.

Title: A Comprehensive Framework for Uncertainty Quantification of Voxel-wise Supervised Models in IVIM MRI
Authors: Nicola Casali, Alessandro Brusaferri, Giuseppe Baselli, Stefano Fumagalli, Edoardo Micotti, Gianluigi Forloni, Riaz Hussein, Giovanna Rizzo, Alfonso Mastropietro
Abstract: Accurate estimation of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) parameters from diffusion-weighted MRI remains challenging due to the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem and high sensitivity to noise, particularly in the perfusion compartment. In this work, we propose a probabilistic deep learning framework based on Deep Ensembles (DE) of Mixture Density Networks (MDNs), enabling estimation of total predictive uncertainty and decomposition into aleatoric (AU) and epistemic (EU) components. The method was benchmarked against non probabilistic neural networks, a Bayesian fitting approach and a probabilistic network with single Gaussian parametrization. Supervised training was performed on synthetic data, and evaluation was conducted on both simulated and an in vivo dataset. The reliability of the quantified uncertainties was assessed using calibration curves, output distribution sharpness, and the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). MDNs produced more calibrated and sharper predictive distributions for the diffusion coefficient D and fraction f parameters, although slight overconfidence was observed in pseudo-diffusion coefficient D*. The Robust Coefficient of Variation (RCV) indicated smoother in vivo estimates for D* with MDNs compared to Gaussian model. Despite the training data covering the expected physiological range, elevated EU in vivo suggests a mismatch with real acquisition conditions, highlighting the importance of incorporating EU, which was allowed by DE. Overall, we present a comprehensive framework for IVIM fitting with uncertainty quantification, which enables the identification and interpretation of unreliable estimates. The proposed approach can also be adopted for fitting other physical models through appropriate architectural and simulation adjustments.

Title: Robust Regret Optimal Control
Authors: Jietian Liu, Peter Seiler
Abstract: This paper presents a synthesis method for robust, regret optimal control. The plant is modeled in discrete-time by an uncertain linear time-invariant (LTI) system. An optimal non-causal controller is constructed using the nominal plant model and given full knowledge of the disturbance. Robust regret is defined relative to the performance of this optimal non-causal control. It is shown that a controller achieves robust regret if and only if it satisfies a robust $H_\infty$ performance condition. DK-iteration can be used to synthesize a controller that satisfies this condition and hence achieve a given level of robust regret. The approach is demonstrated three examples: (i) a simple single-input, single-output classical design, (ii) a longitudinal control for a simplified model for a Boeing 747 model, and (iii) an active suspension for a quarter car model. All examples compare the robust regret optimal against regret optimal controllers designed without uncertainty.

Title: Quaternion-Based Sliding Mode Control for Six Degrees of Freedom Flight Control of Quadrotors
Authors: Amin Yazdanshenas, Reza Faieghi
Abstract: Despite extensive research on sliding mode control (SMC) design for quadrotors, the existing approaches suffer from certain limitations. Euler angle-based SMC formulations suffer from poor performance in high-pitch or -roll maneuvers. Quaternion-based SMC approaches have unwinding issues and complex architecture. Coordinate-free methods are slow and only almost globally stable. This paper presents a new six degrees of freedom SMC flight controller to address the above limitations. We use a cascaded architecture with a position controller in the outer loop and a quaternion-based attitude controller in the inner loop. The position controller generates the desired trajectory for the attitude controller using a coordinate-free approach. The quaternion-based attitude controller uses the natural characteristics of the quaternion hypersphere, featuring a simple structure while providing global stability and avoiding unwinding issues. We compare our controller with three other common control methods conducting challenging maneuvers like flip-over and high-speed trajectory tracking in the presence of model uncertainties and disturbances. Our controller consistently outperforms the benchmark approaches with less control effort and actuator saturation, offering highly effective and efficient flight control.

Title: SincVAE: A new semi-supervised approach to improve anomaly detection on EEG data using SincNet and variational autoencoder
Authors: Andrea Pollastro, Francesco Isgrò, Roberto Prevete
Abstract: Over the past few decades, electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring has become a pivotal tool for diagnosing neurological disorders, particularly for detecting seizures. Epilepsy, one of the most prevalent neurological diseases worldwide, affects approximately the 1 \% of the population. These patients face significant risks, underscoring the need for reliable, continuous seizure monitoring in daily life. Most of the techniques discussed in the literature rely on supervised Machine Learning (ML) methods. However, the challenge of accurately labeling variations in epileptic EEG waveforms complicates the use of these approaches. Additionally, the rarity of ictal events introduces an high imbalancing within the data, which could lead to poor prediction performance in supervised learning approaches. Instead, a semi-supervised approach allows to train the model only on data not containing seizures, thus avoiding the issues related to the data imbalancing. This work proposes a semi-supervised approach for detecting epileptic seizures from EEG data, utilizing a novel Deep Learning-based method called SincVAE. This proposal incorporates the learning of an ad-hoc array of bandpass filter as a first layer of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), potentially eliminating the preprocessing stage where informative band frequencies are identified and isolated. Results indicate that SincVAE improves seizure detection in EEG data and is capable of identifying early seizures during the preictal stage as well as monitoring patients throughout the postictal stage.

Title: Learned Single-Pass Multitasking Perceptual Graphics for Immersive Displays
Authors: Doğa Yılmaz, He Wang, Towaki Takikawa, Duygu Ceylan, Kaan Akşit
Abstract: Emerging immersive display technologies efficiently utilize resources with perceptual graphics methods such as foveated rendering and denoising. Running multiple perceptual graphics methods challenges devices with limited power and computational resources. We propose a computationally-lightweight learned multitasking perceptual graphics model. Given RGB images and text-prompts, our model performs text-described perceptual tasks in a single inference step. Simply daisy-chaining multiple models or training dedicated models can lead to model management issues and exhaust computational resources. In contrast, our flexible method unlocks consistent high quality perceptual effects with reasonable compute, supporting various permutations at varied intensities using adjectives in text prompts (e.g. mildly, lightly). Text-guidance provides ease of use for dynamic requirements such as creative processes. To train our model, we propose a dataset containing source and perceptually enhanced images with corresponding text prompts. We evaluate our model on desktop and embedded platforms and validate perceptual quality through a user study.

Title: Recent Advances in Speech Language Models: A Survey
Authors: Wenqian Cui, Dianzhi Yu, Xiaoqi Jiao, Ziqiao Meng, Guangyan Zhang, Qichao Wang, Yiwen Guo, Irwin King
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently garnered significant attention, primarily for their capabilities in text-based interactions. However, natural human interaction often relies on speech, necessitating a shift towards voice-based models. A straightforward approach to achieve this involves a pipeline of ``Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) + LLM + Text-to-Speech (TTS)", where input speech is transcribed to text, processed by an LLM, and then converted back to speech. Despite being straightforward, this method suffers from inherent limitations, such as information loss during modality conversion, significant latency due to the complex pipeline, and error accumulation across the three stages. To address these issues, Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) -- end-to-end models that generate speech without converting from text -- have emerged as a promising alternative. This survey paper provides the first comprehensive overview of recent methodologies for constructing SpeechLMs, detailing the key components of their architecture and the various training recipes integral to their development. Additionally, we systematically survey the various capabilities of SpeechLMs, categorize their evaluation metrics, and discuss the challenges and future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.

Title: A Runtime-Adaptive Transformer Neural Network Accelerator on FPGAs
Authors: Ehsan Kabir, Jason D. Bakos, David Andrews, Miaoqing Huang
Abstract: Transformer neural networks (TNN) excel in natural language processing (NLP), machine translation, and computer vision (CV) without relying on recurrent or convolutional layers. However, they have high computational and memory demands, particularly on resource-constrained devices like FPGAs. Moreover, transformer models vary in processing time across applications, requiring custom models with specific parameters. Designing custom accelerators for each model is complex and time-intensive. Some custom accelerators exist with no runtime adaptability, and they often rely on sparse matrices to reduce latency. However, hardware designs become more challenging due to the need for application-specific sparsity patterns. This paper introduces ADAPTOR, a runtime-adaptive accelerator for dense matrix computations in transformer encoders and decoders on FPGAs. ADAPTOR enhances the utilization of processing elements and on-chip memory, enhancing parallelism and reducing latency. It incorporates efficient matrix tiling to distribute resources across FPGA platforms and is fully quantized for computational efficiency and portability. Evaluations on Xilinx Alveo U55C data center cards and embedded platforms like VC707 and ZCU102 show that our design is 1.2$\times$ and 2.87$\times$ more power efficient than the NVIDIA K80 GPU and the i7-8700K CPU respectively. Additionally, it achieves a speedup of 1.7 to 2.25$\times$ compared to some state-of-the-art FPGA-based accelerators.

Title: PL-DCP: A Pairwise Learning framework with Domain and Class Prototypes for EEG emotion recognition under unseen target conditions
Authors: Guangli Li, Canbiao Wu, Zhehao Zhou, Tuo Sun, Ping Tan, Li Zhang, Zhen Liang
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals serve as a powerful tool in affective Brain-Computer Interfaces (aBCIs) and play a crucial role in affective computing. In recent years, the introduction of deep learning techniques has significantly advanced the development of aBCIs. However, the current emotion recognition methods based on deep transfer learning face the challenge of the dual dependence of the model on source domain and target domain, As well as being affected by label noise, which seriously affects the performance and generalization ability of the model. To overcome this limitation, we proposes a Pairwise Learning framework with Domain and Category Prototypes for EEG emotion recognition under unseen target conditions (PL-DCP), and integrating concepts of feature disentanglement and prototype inference. Here, the feature disentanglement module extracts and decouples the emotional EEG features to form domain features and class features, and further calculates the dual prototype representation. The Domain-pprototype captures the individual variations across subjects, while the class-prototype captures the cross-individual commonality of emotion categories. In addition, the pairwise learning strategy effectively reduces the noise effect caused by wrong labels. The PL-DCP framework conducts a systematic experimental evaluation on the published datasets SEED, SEED-IV and SEED-V, and the accuracy are 82.88\%, 65.15\% and 61.29\%, respectively. The results show that compared with other State-of-the-Art(SOTA) Methods, the PL-DCP model still achieves slightly better performance than the deep transfer learning method that requires both source and target data, although the target domain is completely unseen during the training. This work provides an effective and robust potential solution for emotion recognition. The source code is available at this https URL.

Title: Video Soundtrack Generation by Aligning Emotions and Temporal Boundaries
Authors: Serkan Sulun, Paula Viana, Matthew E. P. Davies
Abstract: We introduce EMSYNC, a video-based symbolic music generation model that aligns music with a video's emotional content and temporal boundaries. It follows a two-stage framework, where a pretrained video emotion classifier extracts emotional features, and a conditional music generator produces MIDI sequences guided by both emotional and temporal cues. We introduce boundary offsets, a novel temporal conditioning mechanism that enables the model to anticipate and align musical chords with scene cuts. Unlike existing models, our approach retains event-based encoding, ensuring fine-grained timing control and expressive musical nuances. We also propose a mapping scheme to bridge the video emotion classifier, which produces discrete emotion categories, with the emotion-conditioned MIDI generator, which operates on continuous-valued valence-arousal inputs. In subjective listening tests, EMSYNC outperforms state-of-the-art models across all subjective metrics, for music theory-aware participants as well as the general listeners.

Title: Quaternion-Hadamard Network: A Novel Defense Against Adversarial Attacks with a New Dataset
Authors: Vladimir Frants, Sos Agaian
Abstract: This paper addresses the vulnerability of deep-learning models designed for rain, snow, and haze removal. Despite enhancing image quality in adverse weather, these models are susceptible to adversarial attacks that compromise their effectiveness. Traditional defenses such as adversarial training and model distillation often require extensive retraining, making them costly and impractical for real-world deployment. While denoising and super-resolution techniques can aid image classification models, they impose high computational demands and introduce visual artifacts that hinder image processing tasks. We propose a model-agnostic defense against first-order white-box adversarial attacks using the Quaternion-Hadamard Network (QHNet) to tackle these challenges. White-box attacks are particularly difficult to defend against since attackers have full access to the model's architecture, weights, and training procedures. Our defense introduces the Quaternion Hadamard Denoising Convolutional Block (QHDCB) and the Quaternion Denoising Residual Block (QDRB), leveraging polynomial thresholding. QHNet incorporates these blocks within an encoder-decoder architecture, enhanced by feature refinement, to effectively neutralize adversarial noise. Additionally, we introduce the Adversarial Weather Conditions Vision Dataset (AWCVD), created by applying first-order gradient attacks on state-of-the-art weather removal techniques in scenarios involving haze, rain streaks, and snow. Using PSNR and SSIM metrics, we demonstrate that QHNet significantly enhances the robustness of low-level computer vision models against adversarial attacks compared with state-of-the-art denoising and super-resolution techniques. The source code and dataset will be released alongside the final version of this paper.

Title: BUFFER-X: Towards Zero-Shot Point Cloud Registration in Diverse Scenes
Authors: Minkyun Seo, Hyungtae Lim, Kanghee Lee, Luca Carlone, Jaesik Park
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning-based point cloud registration have improved generalization, yet most methods still require retraining or manual parameter tuning for each new environment. In this paper, we identify three key factors limiting generalization: (a) reliance on environment-specific voxel size and search radius, (b) poor out-of-domain robustness of learning-based keypoint detectors, and (c) raw coordinate usage, which exacerbates scale discrepancies. To address these issues, we present a zero-shot registration pipeline called BUFFER-X by (a) adaptively determining voxel size/search radii, (b) using farthest point sampling to bypass learned detectors, and (c) leveraging patch-wise scale normalization for consistent coordinate bounds. In particular, we present a multi-scale patch-based descriptor generation and a hierarchical inlier search across scales to improve robustness in diverse scenes. We also propose a novel generalizability benchmark using 11 datasets that cover various indoor/outdoor scenarios and sensor modalities, demonstrating that BUFFER-X achieves substantial generalization without prior information or manual parameter tuning for the test datasets. Our code is available at this https URL.

Title: How to Adapt Control Barrier Functions? A Learning-Based Approach with Applications to a VTOL Quadplane
Authors: Taekyung Kim, Randal W. Beard, Dimitra Panagou
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel theoretical framework for online adaptation of Control Barrier Function (CBF) parameters, i.e., of the class K functions included in the CBF condition, under input constraints. We introduce the concept of locally validated CBF parameters, which are adapted online to guarantee finite-horizon safety, based on conditions derived from Nagumo's theorem and tangent cone analysis. To identify these parameters online, we integrate a learning-based approach with an uncertainty-aware verification process that account for both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties inherent in neural network predictions. Our method is demonstrated on a VTOL quadplane model during challenging transition and landing maneuvers, showcasing enhanced performance while maintaining safety.

Title: Towards a General-Purpose Zero-Shot Synthetic Low-Light Image and Video Pipeline
Authors: Joanne Lin, Crispian Morris, Ruirui Lin, Fan Zhang, David Bull, Nantheera Anantrasirichai
Abstract: Low-light conditions pose significant challenges for both human and machine annotation. This in turn has led to a lack of research into machine understanding for low-light images and (in particular) videos. A common approach is to apply annotations obtained from high quality datasets to synthetically created low light versions. In addition, these approaches are often limited through the use of unrealistic noise models. In this paper, we propose a new Degradation Estimation Network (DEN), which synthetically generates realistic standard RGB (sRGB) noise without the requirement for camera metadata. This is achieved by estimating the parameters of physics-informed noise distributions, trained in a self-supervised manner. This zero-shot approach allows our method to generate synthetic noisy content with a diverse range of realistic noise characteristics, unlike other methods which focus on recreating the noise characteristics of the training data. We evaluate our proposed synthetic pipeline using various methods trained on its synthetic data for typical low-light tasks including synthetic noise replication, video enhancement, and object detection, showing improvements of up to 24\% KLD, 21\% LPIPS, and 62\% AP$_{50-95}$, respectively.

Title: Modelling and Performance Analysis of Non-Primary Channel Access in Wi-Fi Networks
Authors: Boris Bellalta, Francesc Wilhelmi, Lorenzo Galati-Giordano, Giovanni Geraci
Abstract: This paper aims to improve our understanding of the performance of the Non-Primary Channel Access (NPCA) mechanism, a new feature introduced in IEEE 802.11bn to enhance spectrum utilization in Wi-Fi networks. NPCA enables devices to contend for and transmit on the secondary channel when the primary channel is occupied by transmissions from an Overlapping Basic Service Set (OBSS). We develop a Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) model that captures the interactions among OBSSs in dense Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) environments when NPCA is enabled, incorporating new NPCA-specific states and transitions. In addition to the analytical insights offered by the model, we conduct numerical evaluations and simulations to quantify NPCA's impact on throughput and channel access delay across various scenarios. Our results show that NPCA can significantly improve throughput and reduce access delays in favorable conditions for BSSs that support the mechanism. Moreover, NPCA helps mitigate the OBSS performance anomaly, where low-rate OBSS transmissions degrade network performance for all nearby devices. However, we also observe trade-offs: NPCA may increase contention on secondary channels, potentially reducing transmission opportunities for BSSs operating there.

Title: Subframework-based Bearing Rigidity Maintenance Control in Multirobot Networks
Authors: J. Francisco Presenza, Ignacio Mas, J. Ignacio Alvarez-Hamelin, Juan I. Giribet
Abstract: This work presents a novel approach for \textit{bearing rigidity} analysis and control in multi-robot networks with sensing constraints and dynamic topology. By decomposing the system's framework into \textit{subframeworks}, we express bearing rigidity -- a global property -- as a set of \textit{local} properties, with rigidity eigenvalues serving as natural \textit{local rigidity measures}. We propose a decentralized gradient-based controller to execute mission-specific commands using only bearing measurements. The controller preserves bearing rigidity by keeping the rigidity eigenvalues above a threshold, using only information exchanged within subframeworks. Simulations evaluate the scheme's effectiveness, underscoring its scalability and practicality.

Title: Enabling On-Device Medical AI Assistants via Input-Driven Saliency Adaptation
Authors: Uttej Kallakurik, Edward Humes, Rithvik Jonna, Xiaomin Lin, Tinoosh Mohsenin
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significant impact on the healthcare scenarios but remain prohibitively large for deployment in real-time, resource-constrained environments such as edge devices. In this work, we introduce a novel medical assistant system, optimized through our general-purpose compression framework, which tailors Large Language Models (LLMs) for deployment in specialized domains. By measuring neuron saliency on domain-specific data, our method can aggressively prune irrelevant neurons, reducing model size while preserving performance. Following pruning, we apply post-training quantization to further reduce the memory footprint, and evaluate the compressed model across medical benchmarks including MedMCQA, MedQA, and PubMedQA. We also deploy the 50\% compressed Gemma and the 67\% compressed LLaMA3 models on Jetson Orin Nano (18.7W peak) and Raspberry Pi 5 (6.3W peak), achieving real-time, energy-efficient inference under hardware constraints.

Title: Data-driven control of a magnetohydrodynamic flow
Authors: Adam Uchytil, Milan Korda, Jiří Zemánek
Abstract: We demonstrate the feedback control of a weakly conducting magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow via Lorentz forces generated by externally applied electric and magnetic fields. Specifically, we steer the flow of an electrolyte toward prescribed velocity or vorticity patterns using arrays of electrodes and electromagnets positioned around and beneath a fluid reservoir, with feedback provided by planar particle image velocimetry (PIV). Control is implemented using a model predictive control (MPC) framework, in which control signals are computed by minimizing a cost function over the predicted evolution of the flow. The predictor is constructed entirely from data using Koopman operator theory, which enables a linear representation of the underlying nonlinear fluid dynamics. This linearity allows the MPC problem to be solved by alternating between two small and efficiently solvable convex quadratic programs (QPs): one for the electrodes and one for the electromagnets. The resulting controller runs in a closed loop on a standard laptop, enabling real-time control of the flow. We demonstrate the functionality of the approach through experiments in which the flow is shaped to match a range of reference velocity fields and a time-varying vorticity field.

Title: Systolic Array-based Accelerator for Structured State-Space Models
Authors: Shiva Raja, Cansu Demirkiran, Aakash Sarkar, Milos Popovic, Ajay Joshi
Abstract: Sequence modeling is crucial for AI to understand temporal data and detect complex time-dependent patterns. While recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Transformers have advanced in capturing long-range dependencies, they struggle with achieving high accuracy with very long sequences due to limited memory retention (fixed context window). State-Space Models (SSMs) leverage exponentially decaying memory enabling lengthy context window and so they process very long data sequences more efficiently than recurrent and Transformer-based models. Unlike traditional neural models like CNNs and RNNs, SSM-based models require solving differential equations through continuous integration, making training and inference both compute- and memory-intensive on conventional CPUs and GPUs. In this paper we introduce a specialized hardware accelerator, EpochCore, for accelerating SSMs. EpochCore is based on systolic arrays (SAs) and is designed to enhance the energy efficiency and throughput of inference of SSM-based models for long-range sequence tasks. Within the SA, we propose a versatile processing element (PE) called LIMA-PE to perform traditional and specialized MAC operations to support traditional DNNs and SSMs. To complement the EpochCore microarchitecture, we propose a novel dataflow, ProDF, which enables highly efficient execution of SSM-based models. By leveraging the LIMA-PE microarchitecture and ProDF, EpochCore achieves on average 2000x improvement in performance on LRA datasets compared to a GPU and 250x gains in performance and 45x improvement in energy efficiency, over traditional SA-based accelerators (TPU).

Title: Efficient Pain Recognition via Respiration Signals: A Single Cross-Attention Transformer Multi-Window Fusion Pipeline
Authors: Stefanos Gkikas, Ioannis Kyprakis, Manolis Tsiknakis
Abstract: Pain is a complex condition affecting a large portion of the population. Accurate and consistent evaluation is essential for individuals experiencing pain, and it supports the development of effective and advanced management strategies. Automatic pain assessment systems provide continuous monitoring and support clinical decision-making, aiming to reduce distress and prevent functional decline. This study has been submitted to the \textit{Second Multimodal Sensing Grand Challenge for Next-Gen Pain Assessment (AI4PAIN)}. The proposed method introduces a pipeline that leverages respiration as the input signal and incorporates a highly efficient cross-attention transformer alongside a multi-windowing strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that respiration is a valuable physiological modality for pain assessment. Moreover, experiments revealed that compact and efficient models, when properly optimized, can achieve strong performance, often surpassing larger counterparts. The proposed multi-window approach effectively captures both short-term and long-term features, as well as global characteristics, thereby enhancing the model's representational capacity.

Title: Bayesian Optimization applied for accelerated Virtual Validation of the Autonomous Driving Function
Authors: Satyesh Shanker Awasthi, Mohammed Irshadh Ismaaeel Sathyamangalam Imran, Stefano Arrigoni, Francesco Braghin
Abstract: Rigorous Verification and Validation (V&V) of Autonomous Driving Functions (ADFs) is paramount for ensuring the safety and public acceptance of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). Current validation relies heavily on simulation to achieve sufficient test coverage within the Operational Design Domain (ODD) of a vehicle, but exhaustively exploring the vast parameter space of possible scenarios is computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work introduces a framework based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) to accelerate the discovery of critical scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework on an Model Predictive Controller (MPC)-based motion planner, showing that it identifies hazardous situations, such as off-road events, using orders of magnitude fewer simulations than brute-force Design of Experiments (DoE) methods. Furthermore, this study investigates the scalability of the framework in higher-dimensional parameter spaces and its ability to identify multiple, distinct critical regions within the ODD of the motion planner used as the case study .

Title: AudioGen-Omni: A Unified Multimodal Diffusion Transformer for Video-Synchronized Audio, Speech, and Song Generation
Authors: Le Wang, Jun Wang, Chunyu Qiang, Feng Deng, Chen Zhang, Di Zhang, Kun Gai
Abstract: We present AudioGen-Omni - a unified approach based on multimodal diffusion transformers (MMDit), capable of generating high-fidelity audio, speech, and song coherently synchronized with the input video. AudioGen-Omni introduces a novel joint training paradigm that seamlessly integrates large-scale video-text-audio corpora, enabling a model capable of generating semantically rich, acoustically diverse audio conditioned on multimodal inputs and adaptable to a wide range of audio generation tasks. AudioGen-Omni employs a unified lyrics-transcription encoder that encodes graphemes and phonemes from both song and spoken inputs into dense frame-level representations. Dense frame-level representations are fused using an AdaLN-based joint attention mechanism enhanced with phase-aligned anisotropic positional infusion (PAAPI), wherein RoPE is selectively applied to temporally structured modalities to ensure precise and robust cross-modal alignment. By unfreezing all modalities and masking missing inputs, AudioGen-Omni mitigates the semantic constraints of text-frozen paradigms, enabling effective cross-modal conditioning. This joint training approach enhances audio quality, semantic alignment, and lip-sync accuracy, while also achieving state-of-the-art results on Text-to-Audio/Speech/Song tasks. With an inference time of 1.91 seconds for 8 seconds of audio, it offers substantial improvements in both efficiency and generality.

Title: Towards Reliable Audio Deepfake Attribution and Model Recognition: A Multi-Level Autoencoder-Based Framework
Authors: Andrea Di Pierno (1), Luca Guarnera (2), Dario Allegra (2), Sebastiano Battiato (2) ((1) IMT School of Advanced Studies, (2) University of Catania)
Abstract: The proliferation of audio deepfakes poses a growing threat to trust in digital communications. While detection methods have advanced, attributing audio deepfakes to their source models remains an underexplored yet crucial challenge. In this paper we introduce LAVA (Layered Architecture for Voice Attribution), a hierarchical framework for audio deepfake detection and model recognition that leverages attention-enhanced latent representations extracted by a convolutional autoencoder trained solely on fake audio. Two specialized classifiers operate on these features: Audio Deepfake Attribution (ADA), which identifies the generation technology, and Audio Deepfake Model Recognition (ADMR), which recognize the specific generative model instance. To improve robustness under open-set conditions, we incorporate confidence-based rejection thresholds. Experiments on ASVspoof2021, FakeOrReal, and CodecFake show strong performance: the ADA classifier achieves F1-scores over 95% across all datasets, and the ADMR module reaches 96.31% macro F1 across six classes. Additional tests on unseen attacks from ASVpoof2019 LA and error propagation analysis confirm LAVA's robustness and reliability. The framework advances the field by introducing a supervised approach to deepfake attribution and model recognition under open-set conditions, validated on public benchmarks and accompanied by publicly released models and code.

Title: Tunable Leg Stiffness in a Monopedal Hopper for Energy-Efficient Vertical Hopping Across Varying Ground Profiles
Authors: Rongqian Chen, Jun Kwon, Kefan Wu, Wei-Hsi Chen
Abstract: We present the design and implementation of HASTA (Hopper with Adjustable Stiffness for Terrain Adaptation), a vertical hopping robot with real-time tunable leg stiffness, aimed at optimizing energy efficiency across various ground profiles (a pair of ground stiffness and damping conditions). By adjusting leg stiffness, we aim to maximize apex hopping height, a key metric for energy-efficient vertical hopping. We hypothesize that softer legs perform better on soft, damped ground by minimizing penetration and energy loss, while stiffer legs excel on hard, less damped ground by reducing limb deformation and energy dissipation. Through experimental tests and simulations, we find the best leg stiffness within our selection for each combination of ground stiffness and damping, enabling the robot to achieve maximum steady-state hopping height with a constant energy input. These results support our hypothesis that tunable stiffness improves energy-efficient locomotion in controlled experimental conditions. In addition, the simulation provides insights that could aid in the future development of controllers for selecting leg stiffness.
