Title: Deep learning approach for flow visualization in background-oriented schlieren
Authors: Viren S. Ram, Tullio de Rubeis, Dario Ambrosini, Rajshekhar Gannavarpu
Abstract: Diffractive optical element based background oriented schlieren (BOS) is a popular technique for quantitative flow visualization. This technique relies on encoding spatial density variations of the test medium in the form of an optical fringe pattern; and hence, its accuracy is directly influenced by the quality of fringe pattern demodulation. We introduce a robust deep learning assisted subspace method which enables reliable fringe pattern demodulation even in the presence of severe noise and uneven fringe distortions in recorded BOS fringe patterns. The method's effectiveness to handle fringe pattern artifacts is demonstrated via rigorous numerical simulations. Furthermore, the method's practical applicability is experimentally validated using real-world BOS images obtained from a liquid diffusion process.

Title: Evaluating the Impact of Radiographic Noise on Chest X-ray Semantic Segmentation and Disease Classification Using a Scalable Noise Injection Framework
Authors: Derek Jiu, Kiran Nijjer, Nishant Chinta, Ryan Bui, Ben Liu, Kevin Zhu
Abstract: Deep learning models are increasingly used for radiographic analysis, but their reliability is challenged by the stochastic noise inherent in clinical imaging. A systematic, cross-task understanding of how different noise types impact these models is lacking. Here, we evaluate the robustness of state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to simulated quantum (Poisson) and electronic (Gaussian) noise in two key chest X-ray tasks: semantic segmentation and pulmonary disease classification. Using a novel, scalable noise injection framework, we applied controlled, clinically-motivated noise severities to common architectures (UNet, DeepLabV3, FPN; ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet) on public datasets (Landmark, ChestX-ray14). Our results reveal a stark dichotomy in task robustness. Semantic segmentation models proved highly vulnerable, with lung segmentation performance collapsing under severe electronic noise (Dice Similarity Coefficient drop of 0.843), signifying a near-total model failure. In contrast, classification tasks demonstrated greater overall resilience, but this robustness was not uniform. We discovered a differential vulnerability: certain tasks, such as distinguishing Pneumothorax from Atelectasis, failed catastrophically under quantum noise (AUROC drop of 0.355), while others were more susceptible to electronic noise. These findings demonstrate that while classification models possess a degree of inherent robustness, pixel-level segmentation tasks are far more brittle. The task- and noise-specific nature of model failure underscores the critical need for targeted validation and mitigation strategies before the safe clinical deployment of diagnostic AI.

Title: Position-Blind Ptychography: Viability of image reconstruction via data-driven variational inference
Authors: Simon Welker, Lorenz Kuger, Tim Roith, Berthy Feng, Martin Burger, Timo Gerkmann, Henry Chapman
Abstract: In this work, we present and investigate the novel blind inverse problem of position-blind ptychography, i.e., ptychographic phase retrieval without any knowledge of scan positions, which then must be recovered jointly with the image. The motivation for this problem comes from single-particle diffractive X-ray imaging, where particles in random orientations are illuminated and a set of diffraction patterns is collected. If one uses a highly focused X-ray beam, the measurements would also become sensitive to the beam positions relative to each particle and therefore ptychographic, but these positions are also unknown. We investigate the viability of image reconstruction in a simulated, simplified 2-D variant of this difficult problem, using variational inference with modern data-driven image priors in the form of score-based diffusion models. We find that, with the right illumination structure and a strong prior, one can achieve reliable and successful image reconstructions even under measurement noise, in all except the most difficult evaluated imaging scenario.

Title: Experimental Demonstration of Robust Distributed Wireless Clock Synchronization
Authors: Kumar Sai Bondada, Hiten Kothari, Yibin Liang, Daniel J. Jakubisin, R. Michael Buehrer
Abstract: Distributed wireless clock synchronization is essential for aligning the clocks of distributed transceivers in support of joint transmission and reception techniques. One recently explored method involves synchronizing distributed transceivers using a two-tone waveform, where the tones are separated in frequency by a clock (frequency) reference signal. Prior research has demonstrated frequency accuracy better than 1 Hz; however, this approach remains vulnerable to both intentional and unintentional interference. In this demonstration, we present a robust, frequency-hopped two-tone waveform that enables transceivers to extract the reference signal without prior knowledge of the exact frequency at which the tones are transmitted.

Title: Anatomy-DT: A Cross-Diffusion Digital Twin for Anatomical Evolution
Authors: Moinak Bhattacharya, Gagandeep Singh, Prateek Prasanna
Abstract: Accurately modeling the spatiotemporal evolution of tumor morphology from baseline imaging is a pre-requisite for developing digital twin frameworks that can simulate disease progression and treatment response. Most existing approaches primarily characterize tumor growth while neglecting the concomitant alterations in adjacent anatomical structures. In reality, tumor evolution is highly non-linear and heterogeneous, shaped not only by therapeutic interventions but also by its spatial context and interaction with neighboring tissues. Therefore, it is critical to model tumor progression in conjunction with surrounding anatomy to obtain a comprehensive and clinically relevant understanding of disease dynamics. We introduce a mathematically grounded framework that unites mechanistic partial differential equations with differentiable deep learning. Anatomy is represented as a multi-class probability field on the simplex and evolved by a cross-diffusion reaction-diffusion system that enforces inter-class competition and exclusivity. A differentiable implicit-explicit scheme treats stiff diffusion implicitly while handling nonlinear reaction and event terms explicitly, followed by projection back to the simplex. To further enhance global plausibility, we introduce a topology regularizer that simultaneously enforces centerline preservation and penalizes region overlaps. The approach is validated on synthetic datasets and a clinical dataset. On synthetic benchmarks, our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while preserving topology, and also demonstrates superior performance on the clinical dataset. By integrating PDE dynamics, topology-aware regularization, and differentiable solvers, this work establishes a principled path toward anatomy-to-anatomy generation for digital twins that are visually realistic, anatomically exclusive, and topologically consistent.

Title: Safe and Stable Control via Lyapunov-Guided Diffusion Models
Authors: Xiaoyuan Cheng, Xiaohang Tang, Yiming Yang
Abstract: Diffusion models have made significant strides in recent years, exhibiting strong generalization capabilities in planning and control tasks. However, most diffusion-based policies remain focused on reward maximization or cost minimization, often overlooking critical aspects of safety and stability. In this work, we propose Safe and Stable Diffusion ($S^2$Diff), a model-based diffusion framework that explores how diffusion models can ensure safety and stability from a Lyapunov perspective. We demonstrate that $S^2$Diff eliminates the reliance on both complex gradient-based solvers (e.g., quadratic programming, non-convex solvers) and control-affine structures, leading to globally valid control policies driven by the learned certificate functions. Additionally, we uncover intrinsic connections between diffusion sampling and Almost Lyapunov theory, enabling the use of trajectory-level control policies to learn better certificate functions for safety and stability guarantees. To validate our approach, we conduct experiments on a wide variety of dynamical control systems, where $S^2$Diff consistently outperforms both certificate-based controllers and model-based diffusion baselines in terms of safety, stability, and overall control performance.

Title: A Graph-based Hybrid Beamforming Framework for MIMO Cell-Free ISAC Networks
Authors: Yanan Du, Sai Xu, Jagmohan Chauhan
Abstract: This paper develops a graph-based hybrid beamforming framework for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cell-free integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks. Specifically, we construct a novel MIMO cell-free ISAC network model. In this model, multiple dual-function base station (BS) transmitters employ distributed hybrid beamforming to enable simultaneous communication and sensing, while maintaining physical separation between the transmitters and the radar receiver. Building on this model, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem under a power constraint to jointly improve communication and sensing performance. To solve it, the problem is first reformulated as a single-objective optimization problem. Then, a graph-based method composed of multiple graph neural networks (GNNs) is developed to realize hybrid beamforming with either perfect or imperfect channel state information. Once trained, the neural network model can be deployed distributively across BSs, enabling fast and efficient inference. To further reduce inference latency, a custom field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based accelerator is developed. Numerical simulations validate the communication and sensing capabilities of the proposed optimization approach, while experimental evaluations demonstrate remarkable performance gains of FPGA-based acceleration in GNN inference.

Title: Neural Fields for Highly Accelerated 2D Cine Phase Contrast MRI
Authors: Pablo Arratia, Martin J. Graves, Mary McLean, Carolin Pirkl, Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb, Timo Schirmer, Florian Wiesinger, Matthias J. Ehrhardt
Abstract: 2D cine phase contrast (CPC) MRI provides quantitative information on blood velocity and flow within the human vasculature. However, data acquisition is time-consuming, motivating the reconstruction of the velocity field from undersampled measurements to reduce scan times. In this work, we propose using neural fields to parametrize the complex-valued images, leveraging their inductive bias for the reconstruction of the velocity data. Additionally, to mitigate the inherent over-smoothing of neural fields, we introduce a simple voxel-based postprocessing step. We validate our method numerically in Cartesian and radial k-space with both high and low temporal resolution data. Our approach achieves accurate reconstructions at high acceleration factors, with low errors even at 16x and 32x undersampling, and consistently outperforms classical locally low-rank regularized voxel-based methods in both flow estimates and anatomical depiction.

Title: A closed-loop $2\times4$ downlink MIMO Framework for 5G New Radio using OpenAirInterface
Authors: Duc Tung Bui, Le-Nam Tran
Abstract: We present the first-of-a-kind closed-loop $2\times4$ MIMO implementation for the downlink of 5G Open RAN using OpenAirInterface (OAI), which is capable of transmitting up to two transmission layers. Our implementation is a fully functional 5G New Radio (5G NR) system, including the 5G Core Network (5G CN), 5G Radio Access Network (5G RAN), as well as 5G NR User Equipment (UEs). This serves as a foundational framework for further advancements in the context of emerging Open RAN (O-RAN) development. A key feature of our implementation is the enhanced Channel State Information (CSI) reporting procedure at the UE, which includes Rank Indicator (RI), Precoding Matrix Indicator (PMI), and Channel Quality Indicator (CQI). It is adjusted for the extended configuration to maximize data rates. To demonstrate the performance of our implementation, we measure the downlink data rates using $\textit{iperf3}$ in two scenarios: (i) fixed channels to assess two-layer data transmission and (ii) $\textit{Rice1}$ channels for general transmission analysis. The obtained simulation results demonstrate that, compared to the existing $2\times2$ MIMO configuration in the OAI, our implementation improves the data rates in almost all scenarios, especially at the high Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNRs).

Title: An Implementation of Multi-User MIMO Downlink for O-RAN 5G New Radio using OpenAirInterface
Authors: Duc Tung Bui, Le-Nam Tran
Abstract: We present the first implementation of a Multi-User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) transmission scheme on the Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) for 5G Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) based on OpenAirInterface (OAI). Our implementation features a fully functional O-RAN-compliant 5G New Radio (5G NR) system, including a 5G Core Network (5G CN), a refined 5G RAN, which is split into a Centre Unit (CU) and an Distributed Unit (DU), and 5G NR User Equipment (UEs). This implementation demonstrates MU-MIMO performance in the downlink while showcasing the disaggregation capabilities of O-RAN. Specifically, the Base Station (i.e. gNB) in our setup is capable of serving two UEs simultaneously over the same downlink Resource Block (RBs). User scheduling is performed based on the Precoding Matrix Indicators (PMIs) reported by the UEs according to the NR Channel State Information (CSI) reporting procedure. The system throughput performance is evaluated using $\textit{iperf}$. The obtained results via simulation and testbed experiments demonstrate that the MU-MIMO scheme achieves significant downlink throughput gains, particularly in the high Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) regime, while keeping the Block Error Rate (BLER) below the required threshold of $10^{-1}$ for both UEs.

Title: Spatiotemporal Forecasting of Incidents and Congestion with Implications for Sustainable Traffic Control
Authors: Tony Kinchen, Ting Bai, Nishanth Venkatesh S., Andreas A. Malikopoulos
Abstract: Urban traffic anomalies such as collisions and disruptions threaten the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of transportation systems. We present a simulation-based framework for modeling, detecting, and predicting such anomalies in urban networks. Using the SUMO platform, we generate reproducible rear-end and intersection crash scenarios with matched baselines, enabling controlled experimentation and comparative evaluation. We record vehicle-level travel time, speed, and emissions for edge and network-level analysis. On this dataset, we develop a hybrid forecasting architecture that combines bidirectional long short-term memory networks with a diffusion convolutional recurrent neural network to capture temporal dynamics and spatial dependencies. Our simulation studies on the Broadway corridor in New York City demonstrate the framework's ability to reproduce consistent incident conditions, quantify their effects, and provide accurate multi-horizon traffic forecasts. Our results highlight the value of combining controlled anomaly generation with deep predictive models to support reproducible evaluation and sustainable traffic management.

Authors: Valdemar Farré, David Vega, Juan Estrada, Juan A. Vásquez Peralvo, Symeon Chatzinotas
Abstract: The proliferation of cell-free Massive MIMO represents a transformative shift in wireless network architecture, addressing critical limitations of conventional distributed Massive MIMO systems. This paper presents an intelligent radio network planning framework that bridges legacy 5G infrastructures with future B5G/6G networks through cell-free architectures. By leveraging operational insights from existing 5G deployments, we systematically address coverage optimization, and capacity enhancement. Our scalable framework enables seamless evolution from legacy designs to next-generation cell-free systems. Through extensive simulations in dense urban environments, we demonstrate substantial improvements: 45% spectral efficiency gains, 30% interference reduction, and significantly enhanced uniform coverage. The proposed framework provides network operators with a practical roadmap for transitioning from traditional cellular architectures to demanding B5G/6G requirements while maximizing existing infrastructure investments.

Title: Joint UE positioning and distributed sensing in the upper mid-band exploiting virtual apertures
Authors: Soroush Mesforush, Murat Bayraktar, Nuria González-Prelcic
Abstract: Networks exploiting distributed integrated sensing and communication (DISAC) nodes can provide enhanced localization and sensing performance, further emphasized when operating with large arrays and bandwidths available in the upper mid-band (also known as FR3). In this paper, we consider a DISAC system operating at FR3 where a single base station (BS) acts as the transmitter and several vehicular user equipments (UEs) act as the receivers. We tackle the design of the signal processing chain at the UE side to enable joint UE positioning and target localization. The system model exploits a multiple-input-multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) waveform, and incorporates practical effects such as inter-node timing offsets (TOs), extended targets, dense multipath, and realistic uniform planar arrays (UPAs) at both ends. The proposed design includes a multipath estimation stage at each UE, clutter removal, a novel clustering and association scheme, and a final joint estimator of UE positions and target locations. The estimator solves a weighted least squares (WLS) problem to jointly compute clock offsets and localize UEs and targets. Numerical results considering two UEs and two targets show that for 80\% of the cases the target localization error is below 32cm, while the UE positioning error is below 44cm.

Title: Modular Design of Strict Control Lyapunov Functions for Global Stabilization of the Unicycle in Polar Coordinates
Authors: Velimir Todorovski, Kwang Hak Kim, Miroslav Krstic
Abstract: Since the mid-1990s, it has been known that, unlike in Cartesian form where Brockett's condition rules out static feedback stabilization, the unicycle is globally asymptotically stabilizable by smooth feedback in polar coordinates. In this note, we introduce a modular framework for designing smooth feedback laws that achieve global asymptotic stabilization in polar coordinates. These laws are bidirectional, enabling efficient parking maneuvers, and are paired with families of strict control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) constructed in a modular fashion. The resulting CLFs guarantee global asymptotic stability with explicit convergence rates and include barrier variants that yield "almost global" stabilization, excluding only zero-measure subsets of the rotation manifolds. The strictness of the CLFs is further leveraged in our companion paper, where we develop inverse-optimal redesigns with meaningful cost functions and infinite gain margins.

Title: Integrator Forwading Design for Unicycles with Constant and Actuated Velocity in Polar Coordinates
Authors: Miroslav Krstic, Velimir Todorovski, Kwang Hak Kim, Alessandro Astolfi
Abstract: In a companion paper, we present a modular framework for unicycle stabilization in polar coordinates that provides smooth steering laws through backstepping. Surprisingly, the same problem also allows the application of integrator forwarding. In this work, we leverage this feature and construct new smooth steering laws together with control Lyapunov functions (CLFs), expanding the set of CLFs available for inverse optimal control design. In the case of constant forward velocity (Dubins car), backstepping produces finite-time (deadbeat) parking, and we show that integrator forwarding yields the very same class of solutions. This reveals a fundamental connection between backstepping and forwarding in addressing both the unicycle and, the Dubins car parking problems.

Title: Rotatable Antenna-Enabled Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio Systems
Authors: Yanhua Tan, Beixiong Zheng, Yi Fang, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng, Rui Zhang, Jie Xu
Abstract: Rotatable antenna (RA) technology has recently drawn significant attention in wireless systems owing to its unique ability to exploit additional spatial degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) by dynamically adjusting the three-dimensional (3D) boresight direction of each antenna. In this letter, we propose a new RA-assisted cognitive radio (CR) system designed to achieve efficient spectrum sharing while mitigating interference between primary and secondary communication links. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem for the joint design of the transmit beamforming and the boresight directions of RAs at the secondary transmitter (ST), aimed at maximizing the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the secondary receiver (SR), while satisfying both interference constraint at the primary receiver (PR) and the maximum transmit power constraint at the ST. Although the formulated problem is challenging to solve due to its non-convexity and coupled variables, we develop an efficient algorithm by leveraging alternating optimization (AO) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques to acquire high-quality solutions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RA-assisted system substantially outperforms conventional benchmark schemes in spectrum-sharing CR systems, validating RA's capability to simultaneously enhance the communication quality at the SR and mitigate interference at the PR.

Title: Enhanced Template-based Intra Mode Derivation with Adaptive Block Vector Replacement
Authors: Jiaqi Zhang, Jiaye Fu, Chuanmin Jia, Siwei Ma, Karam Naser, Thierry Dumas, Saurabh Puri, Milos Radosavljevic
Abstract: Intra prediction is a crucial component in traditional video coding frameworks, aiming to eliminate spatial redundancy within frames. In recent years, an increasing number of decoder-side adaptive mode derivation methods have been adopted into Enhanced Compression Model (ECM). However, these methods predominantly rely on adjacent spatial information for intra mode decision-making, overlooking potential similarity patterns in non-adjacent spatial regions, thereby limiting intra prediction efficiency. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a template-based intra mode derivation approach enhanced by block vector-based prediction. The adaptive block vector replacement strategy effectively expands the reference scope of the existing template-based intra mode derivation mode to non-adjacent spatial information, thereby enhancing prediction efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our strategy achieves 0.082% Bjøntegaard delta rate (BD-rate) savings for Y components under the All Intra (AI) configuration compared to ECM-16.1 while maintaining identical encoding/decoding complexity, and delivers an additional 0.25% BD-rate savings for Y components on screen content sequences.

Title: A Novel Statistical Analysis Method for Radiation Source Classification
Authors: Haobo Geng, Yaoyao Li, Weiping Tong, Youwei Meng, Houpu Xiao, Yicong Liu
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of electronic information technology, the number and variety of unknown radiation sources have increased significantly. Some of these sources share common characteristics, which offers the potential to effectively address the challenge of identifying unknown radiation sources. However, research on the classification of radiation sources remains relatively limited. This paper proposes a big data analysis method that combines linear discriminant analysis (LDA) with a rough neighborhood set (NRS) for radiation source classification, and its effectiveness is validated on the RadioML 2018 dataset. The results indicate that, under certain constraints, all modulation types can be categorized into four distinct classes, laying a foundation for further research on cognitive interference signal cancellation.

Title: Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)-Enabled UAV Delivery
Authors: Suyu Lv, Meng Li, Qi Li, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: A pinching-antenna systems (PASS)-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) delivery framework is proposed, which exploits the capability of PASS to establish a strong line-of-sight link and reduce free-space this http URL at minimizing the communication energy consumption in one cycle, a double-layer optimization (DLO) algorithm is developed by jointly optimizing the UAV delivery sequence and the pinching antenna (PA) activation vector. More specifically, at the outer layer, a hierarchical alternating optimization (HAO) scheme is proposed to tackle the NP-hard problem of delivery sequence planning, where a genetic algorithm performs global exploration to generate candidate solutions at the top-level, while a dynamic programming performs local refinement to obtain elite solutions at the lower-level. With determined UAV trajectory, at the inner layer, focus is placed on addressing the highly coupled mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem of PA activation vector optimization, where a pair of algorithms are proposed: 1) Branch-and-Bound (BnB) algorithm for finding global optimum; 2) incremental search and local refinement (ISLR) algorithm for reducing computational complexity. Simulation results indicate that: i) The proposed HAO-based delivery sequence planning scheme can effectively reduce the total flight distance, thereby decreasing flight time and communication energy consumption; ii) Both the proposed BnB and ISLR algorithms can achieve energy-efficient PA activation, with the former exhibiting better performance and the latter having lower complexity; iii) PASS outperforms the conventional multi-antenna systems, especially with higher communication rate requirements.

Title: Transformer-Based Rate Prediction for Multi-Band Cellular Handsets
Authors: Ruibin Chen, Haozhe Lei, Hao Guo, Marco Mezzavilla, Hitesh Poddar, Tomoki Yoshimura, Sundeep Rangan
Abstract: Cellular wireless systems are witnessing the proliferation of frequency bands over a wide spectrum, particularly with the expansion of new bands in FR3. These bands must be supported in user equipment (UE) handsets with multiple antennas in a constrained form factor. Rapid variations in channel quality across the bands from motion and hand blockage, limited field-of-view of antennas, and hardware and power-constrained measurement sparsity pose significant challenges to reliable multi-band channel tracking. This paper formulates the problem of predicting achievable rates across multiple antenna arrays and bands with sparse historical measurements. We propose a transformer-based neural architecture that takes asynchronous rate histories as input and outputs per-array rate predictions. Evaluated on ray-traced simulations in a dense urban micro-cellular setting with FR1 and FR3 arrays, our method demonstrates superior performance over baseline predictors, enabling more informed band selection under realistic mobility and hardware constraints.

Title: Doppler-Based Multistatic Drone Tracking via Cellular Downlink Signals
Authors: Chenqing Ji, Qionghui Liu, Jiahong Liu, Chao Yu, Yifei Sun, Rui Wang, Fan Liu
Abstract: In this paper, a multistatic Doppler sensing system is proposed for the drone tracking via downlink Long-Term Evolution (LTE) signals. Specifically, the LTE base stations (BSs) are exploited as signal illuminators, and three passive sensing receivers are deployed at different locations to detect the bistatic Doppler frequencies of a target drone from received downlink signals. It is shown that even without the measurements of BS-drone-receiver range and angle, the Doppler measurements could provide sufficient information for trajectory tracking. Particularly, the trajectory of the target drone, consisting of the initial position and velocities of all the time slots, can be reconstructed by solving a minimum mean-squared error problem according to the above Doppler measurements. It is demonstrated by experiment that although the target drone and all the sensing receivers are around 200 meters away from the illuminating BSs, the complicated trajectories can be tracked with 90% errors below 90 centimeters. Since this accuracy is notably higher than the typical range resolution of LTE signals, the demonstration shows that drone trajectory tracking with a high accuracy could be feasible solely according to Doppler detection, as long as the deployment density of receivers is sufficiently high.

Title: Dynamic Causal Attack Graph based Cyber-security Risk Assessment Framework for CTCS System
Authors: Zikai Zhang
Abstract: Protecting the security of the train control system is a critical issue to ensure the safe and reliable operation of high-speed trains. Scientific modeling and analysis for the security risk is a promising way to guarantee system security. However, the representation and assessment of the multi-staged, causally related, and temporal-dynamic changed attack dependencies are difficult in the train control system. To solve the above challenges, a security assessment framework based on the Dynamical Causality Attack Graph (DCAG) model is introduced in this paper. Firstly, the DCAG model is generated based on the attack graph with consideration of temporal attack propagation and multi-stage attack event causality propagation. Then, the DCAG model is analyzed based on Bayesian inference and logic gateway-based inference. Through the case analysis of the CTCS-3 system, the security assessment framework is validated. With the DCAG-based security assessment framework, we can not only perform appropriate security risk quantification calculations, but also explore the importance of different attacks on system security risks, which is helpful in adjusting the cyber security defense policy.

Title: Digital Twin Aided Massive MIMO CSI Feedback: Exploring the Impact of Twinning Fidelity
Authors: Hao Luo, Shuaifeng Jiang, Saeed R. Khosravirad, Ahmed Alkhateeb
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) techniques have demonstrated strong performance in compressing and reconstructing channel state information (CSI) while reducing feedback overhead in massive MIMO systems. A key challenge, however, is their reliance on extensive site-specific training data, whose real-world collection incurs significant overhead and limits scalability across deployment sites. To address this, we propose leveraging site-specific digital twins to assist the training of DL-based CSI compression models. The digital twin integrates an electromagnetic (EM) 3D model of the environment, a hardware model, and ray tracing to produce site-specific synthetic CSI data, allowing DL models to be trained without the need for extensive real-world measurements. We further develop a fidelity analysis framework that decomposes digital twin quality into four key aspects: 3D geometry, material properties, ray tracing, and hardware modeling. We explore how these factors influence the reliability of the data and model performance. To enhance the adaptability to real-world environments, we propose a refinement strategy that incorporates a limited amount of real-world data to fine-tune the DL model pre-trained on the digital twin dataset. Evaluation results show that models trained on site-specific digital twins outperform those trained on generic datasets, with the proposed refinement method effectively enhancing performance using limited real-world data. The simulations also highlight the importance of digital twin fidelity, especially in 3D geometry, ray tracing, and hardware modeling, for improving CSI reconstruction quality. This analysis framework offers valuable insights into the critical fidelity aspects, and facilitates more efficient digital twin development and deployment strategies for various wireless communication tasks.

Title: Delay-Doppler Domain Channel Measurements and Modeling in High-Speed Railways
Authors: Hao Zhou, Yiyan Ma, Dan Fei, Weirong Liu, Zhengyu Zhang, Mi Yang, Guoyu Ma, Yunlong Lu, Ruisi He, Guoyu Wang, Cheng Li, Zhaohui Song, Bo Ai
Abstract: As next-generation wireless communication systems need to be able to operate in high-frequency bands and high-mobility scenarios, delay-Doppler (DD) domain multicarrier (DDMC) modulation schemes, such as orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), demonstrate superior reliability over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Accurate DD domain channel modeling is essential for DDMC system design. However, since traditional channel modeling approaches are mainly confined to time, frequency, and space domains, the principles of DD domain channel modeling remain poorly studied. To address this issue, we propose a systematic DD domain channel measurement and modeling methodology in high-speed railway (HSR) scenarios. First, we design a DD domain channel measurement method based on the long-term evolution for railway (LTE-R) system. Second, for DD domain channel modeling, we investigate quasi-stationary interval, statistical power modeling of multipath components, and particularly, the quasi-invariant intervals of DD domain channel fading coefficients. Third, via LTE-R measurements at 371 km/h, taking the quasi-stationary interval as the decision criterion, we establish DD domain channel models under different channel time-varying conditions in HSR scenarios. Fourth, the accuracy of proposed DD domain channel models is validated via bit error rate comparison of OTFS transmission. In addition, simulation verifies that in HSR scenario, the quasi-invariant interval of DD domain channel fading coefficient is on millisecond (ms) order of magnitude, which is much smaller than the quasi-stationary interval length on $100$ ms order of magnitude. This study could provide theoretical guidance for DD domain modeling in high-mobility environments, supporting future DDMC and integrated sensing and communication designs for 6G and beyond.

Title: Preemptive Spatiotemporal Trajectory Adjustment for Heterogeneous Vehicles in Highway Merging Zones
Authors: Yuan Li, Xiaoxue Xu, Xiang Dong, Junfeng Hao, Tao Li, Sana Ullaha, Chuangrui Huang, Junjie Niu, Ziyan Zhao, Ting Peng
Abstract: Aiming at the problem of driver's perception lag and low utilization efficiency of space-time resources in expressway ramp confluence area, based on the preemptive spatiotemporal trajectory Adjustment system, from the perspective of coordinating spatiotemporal resources, the reasonable value of safe space-time distance in trajectory pre-preparation is quantitatively analyzed. The minimum safety gap required for ramp vehicles to merge into the mainline is analyzed by introducing double positioning error and spatiotemporal trajectory tracking error. A merging control strategy for autonomous driving heterogeneous vehicles is proposed, which integrates vehicle type, driving intention, and safety spatiotemporal distance. The specific confluence strategies of ramp target vehicles and mainline cooperative vehicles under different vehicle types are systematically expounded. A variety of traffic flow and speed scenarios are used for full combination simulation. By comparing the time-position-speed diagram, the vehicle operation characteristics and the dynamic difference of confluence are qualitatively analyzed, and the average speed and average delay are used as the evaluation indices to quantitatively evaluate the performance advantages of the preemptive cooperative confluence control strategy. The results show that the maximum average delay improvement rates of mainline and ramp vehicles are 90.24 % and 74.24 %, respectively. The proposed strategy can effectively avoid potential vehicle conflicts and emergency braking behaviors, improve driving safety in the confluence area, and show significant advantages in driving stability and overall traffic efficiency optimization.

Title: Closed-Form Least-Squares Design of Fast-Convolution Based Variable-Bandwidth FIR Filters
Authors: Oksana Moryakova, Håkan Johansson
Abstract: This paper introduces a closed-form least-squares (LS) design approach for fast-convolution (FC) based variable-bandwidth (VBW) finite-impulse-response (FIR) filters. The proposed LS design utilizes frequency sampling and the VBW filter frequency-domain implementation using the overlap-save (OLS) method, that together offer significant savings in implementation and online bandwidth reconfiguration complexities. Since combining frequency-domain design and OLS implementation leads to a linear periodic time-varying (LPTV) behavior of the VBW filter, a set of the corresponding time-invariant impulse responses is considered in the proposed design. Through numerical examples, it is demonstrated that the proposed approach enables not only closed-form design of FC-based VBW filters with substantial complexity reductions compared to existing solutions for a given performance, but also allows the variable bandwidth range to be extended without any increase in complexity. Moreover, a way of reducing the maximum approximation error energy over the whole set of the time-invariant filters of the LPTV system is shown by introducing appropriate weighting functions in the design.

Title: Joint Communications, Sensing, and Positioning in 6G Multi-Functional Satellite Systems: Survey and Open Challenges
Authors: Chandan Kumar Sheemar, Jorge Querol, Wali Ullah Khan, Prabhu Thiruvasagam, Sourabh Solanki, Idir Edjekouane, Alejandro Gonzalez-Garrido, Mohammed Al-Ansi, Carla E. Garcia, Symeon Chatzinotas
Abstract: Satellite systems are expected to be a cornerstone of sixth-generation (6G) networks, providing ubiquitous coverage and supporting a wide range of services across communications, sensing, and positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT). Meeting these demands with current function-specific payload architectures is challenging in terms of cost, spectral use, and sustainability. This survey introduces the framework of multi-functional satellite systems (MFSS), which integrate two or more of these core services into a single payload, enabling resource sharing and functional synergy. A unified taxonomy is proposed, covering joint communications and sensing (JCAS), joint communications and PNT (JCAP), joint sensing and PNT (JSAP), and fully integrated joint communications, sensing, and PNT (JCSAP) systems. The paper reviews the state-of-the-art in each domain, examines existing payload architectures, and outlines cooperative, integrated, and joint design strategies. Key challenges, including waveform co-design, synchronization, interference mitigation, and resource management, are discussed, along with potential solutions and future research directions. By unifying diverse satellite capabilities within a single platform, MFSS can achieve higher spectral efficiency, reduced launch mass and cost, improved energy use, and enhanced service versatility, contributing to the development of sustainable and intelligent non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) for the 6G and beyond space era.

Authors: Minxing Sun, Li Miao, Qingyu Shen, Yao Mao, Qiliang Bao
Abstract: Classical state estimation algorithms rely on predefined target's state-space model, which complicates model derivation and limits adaptability when system dynamics change. Neural network based estimators offer a data-driven alternative, but rarely fuse classical estimation theory into their structure and demand large, pre-computed training sets. To overcome these limitations, we propose a unified state-space structure without target's state-space model and treats both the input-layer activations and all network weights as latent states to be estimated online. We instantiate this nonlinear model with three canonical estimators-the extended Kalman estimator, the unscented Kalman estimator, and the particle estimator to simulate different neural network and demonstrate its generality. We then benchmark our approach against seven leading neural network estimators across three representative scenarios. Results show that our neural network state-space estimators not only retain the robust learning capability, but also match or exceed the accuracy of both classical and pre-trained neural network methods.

Title: An Analysis of Joint Nonlinear Spatial Filtering for Spatial Aliasing Reduction
Authors: Alina Mannanova, Jakob Kienegger, Timo Gerkmann
Abstract: The performance of traditional linear spatial filters for speech enhancement is constrained by the physical size and number of channels of microphone arrays. For instance, for large microphone distances and high frequencies, spatial aliasing may occur, leading to unwanted enhancement of signals from non-target directions. Recently, it has been proposed to replace linear beamformers by nonlinear deep neural networks for joint spatial-spectral processing. While it has been shown that such approaches result in higher performance in terms of instrumental quality metrics, in this work we highlight their ability to efficiently handle spatial aliasing. In particular, we show that joint spatial and tempo-spectral processing is more robust to spatial aliasing than traditional approaches that perform spatial processing alone or separately with tempo-spectral filtering. The results provide another strong motivation for using deep nonlinear networks in multichannel speech enhancement, beyond their known benefits in managing non-Gaussian noise and multiple speakers, especially when microphone arrays with rather large microphone distances are used.

Title: Performance Evaluation of eLoran Spatial ASF Corrections Based on Measured ASF Map
Authors: Jaewon Yu, Pyo-Woong Son
Abstract: This paper analyzes the effectiveness of spatial ASF correction methods in the Korean eLoran system using measured ASF maps. Three correction scenarios were evaluated under identical simulation settings: no correction (S0), local correction using true ASF values (S1), and wide-area correction using a single reference station value (S2). Simulation results show that S1 consistently achieved the lowest positioning errors, while S0 exhibited the largest errors with extensive high-error regions. S2 provided limited improvements near the reference station but degraded with increasing distance and ASF spatial gradients. The findings highlight that local ASF correction significantly improves eLoran positioning performance, whereas wide-area correction has only localized benefits.

Title: Path-Based Correlation Analysis of Meteorological Factors and eLoran Signal Delay Variations
Authors: Junwoo Song, Pyo-woong Son
Abstract: Unlike GNSS, which is vulnerable to jamming and spoofing due to its inherently weak received power, eLoran exhibits robustness owing to its high field strength. Therefore, the eLoran system can maintain reliable operation even in scenarios where GNSS becomes unavailable. However, since eLoran signals propagate through ground waves, the propagation delay is susceptible to changes in surface conditions, including both terrain and meteorological variations. This study aims to analyze the correlation between the temporal variations in eLoran signal propagation delay and meteorological factors at various points along the signal path.

Title: Multi-modal Liver Segmentation and Fibrosis Staging Using Real-world MRI Images
Authors: Yang Zhou, Kunhao Yuan, Ye Wei, Jishizhan Chen
Abstract: Liver fibrosis represents the accumulation of excessive extracellular matrix caused by sustained hepatic injury. It disrupts normal lobular architecture and function, increasing the chances of cirrhosis and liver failure. Precise staging of fibrosis for early diagnosis and intervention is often invasive, which carries risks and complications. To address this challenge, recent advances in artificial intelligence-based liver segmentation and fibrosis staging offer a non-invasive alternative. As a result, the CARE 2025 Challenge aimed for automated methods to quantify and analyse liver fibrosis in real-world scenarios, using multi-centre, multi-modal, and multi-phase MRI data. This challenge included tasks of precise liver segmentation (LiSeg) and fibrosis staging (LiFS). In this study, we developed an automated pipeline for both tasks across all the provided MRI modalities. This pipeline integrates pseudo-labelling based on multi-modal co-registration, liver segmentation using deep neural networks, and liver fibrosis staging based on shape, textural, appearance, and directional (STAD) features derived from segmentation masks and MRI images. By solely using the released data with limited annotations, our proposed pipeline demonstrated excellent generalisability for all MRI modalities, achieving top-tier performance across all competition subtasks. This approach provides a rapid and reproducible framework for quantitative MRI-based liver fibrosis assessment, supporting early diagnosis and clinical decision-making.

Title: Enhancing Connectivity for Emergency Vehicles Through UAV Trajectory and Resource Allocation Optimization
Authors: S. Fatemeh Bozorgi, S. Mohammad Razavizadeh, Mohsen Rezaee
Abstract: Effective communication for emergency vehicles - such as ambulances and fire trucks - is essential to support their operations in various traffic and environmental conditions. In this context, this paper investigates a vehicular communication system assisted by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), which adjusts its trajectory and resource allocation according to communication needs. The system classifies vehicles into two groups to address their varying service requirements: emergency vehicles, which require a minimum instantaneous data rate to access critical information timely, and normal vehicles. To support both categories effectively, this paper proposes a joint optimization approach that coordinates UAV trajectory planning and Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (DBA). The objective is to maximize the minimum average data rate for normal vehicles while ensuring that emergency vehicles maintain an instantaneous rate above a predefined threshold. This approach takes into account some system constraints, including UAV propulsion power consumption, mobility limitations, and backhaul capacity. To tackle the resulting non-convex problem, an iterative optimization method is employed, where the original problem is decomposed into two subproblems: bandwidth allocation and UAV trajectory design. In each iteration, the trajectory subproblem is solved using the Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) method. Numerical results confirm that the proposed solution achieves superior performance in meeting service requirements compared to baseline methods.

Title: Zimtohrli: An Efficient Psychoacoustic Audio Similarity Metric
Authors: Jyrki Alakuijala, Martin Bruse, Sami Boukortt, Jozef Marus Coldenhoff, Milos Cernak
Abstract: This paper introduces Zimtohrli, a novel, full-reference audio similarity metric designed for efficient and perceptually accurate quality assessment. In an era dominated by computationally intensive deep learning models and proprietary legacy standards, there is a pressing need for an interpretable, psychoacoustically-grounded metric that balances performance with practicality. Zimtohrli addresses this gap by combining a 128-bin gammatone filterbank front-end, which models the frequency resolution of the cochlea, with a unique non-linear resonator model that mimics the human eardrum's response to acoustic stimuli. Similarity is computed by comparing perceptually-mapped spectrograms using modified Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Neurogram Similarity Index Measure (NSIM) algorithms, which incorporate novel non-linearities to better align with human judgment. Zimtohrli achieves superior performance to the baseline open-source ViSQOL metric, and significantly narrows the performance gap with the latest commercial POLQA metric. It offers a compelling balance of perceptual relevance and computational efficiency, positioning it as a strong alternative for modern audio engineering applications, from codec development to the evaluation of generative audio systems.

Title: Ordinal Label-Distribution Learning with Constrained Asymmetric Priors for Imbalanced Retinal Grading
Authors: Nagur Shareef Shaik, Teja Krishna Cherukuri, Adnan Masood, Ehsan Adeli, Dong Hye Ye
Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy grading is inherently ordinal and long-tailed, with minority stages being scarce, heterogeneous, and clinically critical to detect accurately. Conventional methods often rely on isotropic Gaussian priors and symmetric loss functions, misaligning latent representations with the task's asymmetric nature. We propose the Constrained Asymmetric Prior Wasserstein Autoencoder (CAP-WAE), a novel framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations. Our approach employs a Wasserstein Autoencoder (WAE) that aligns its aggregate posterior with a asymmetric prior, preserving the heavy-tailed and skewed structure of minority classes. The latent space is further structured by a Margin-Aware Orthogonality and Compactness (MAOC) loss to ensure grade-ordered separability. At the supervision level, we introduce a direction-aware ordinal loss, where a lightweight head predicts asymmetric dispersions to generate soft labels that reflect clinical priorities by penalizing under-grading more severely. Stabilized by an adaptive multi-task weighting scheme, our end-to-end model requires minimal tuning. Across public DR benchmarks, CAP-WAE consistently achieves state-of-the-art Quadratic Weighted Kappa, accuracy, and macro-F1, surpassing both ordinal classification and latent generative baselines. t-SNE visualizations further reveal that our method reshapes the latent manifold into compact, grade-ordered clusters with reduced overlap.

Title: Secrecy-Driven Beamforming for Multi-User Integrated Sensing and Communication
Authors: Ali Khandan Boroujeni, Hyeon Seok Rou, Ghazal Bagheri, Kuranage Roche Rayan Ranasinghe, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, Stefan Köpsell, Rafael F. Schaefer
Abstract: This paper proposes a secure integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) framework for multi-user systems with multiple communication users (CUs) and adversarial targets, where the design problem is formulated to maximize secrecy rate under joint sensing and communication constraints. An efficient solution is presented based on an accelerated fractional programming method using a non-homogeneous complex quadratic transform (QT), which decomposes the problem into tractable subproblems for beamforming and artificial noise (AN) optimization. Unlike conventional artificial noise strategies, the proposed approach also exploits AN to enhance sensing while avoiding interference with legitimate users. Simulation results show significant gains in secrecy rate, communication reliability, and sensing accuracy, confirming the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed framework.

Title: FinGAN: An Interpretable RSS Generation Network for Scalable Fingerprint Localization
Authors: Jiaming Zhang, Jiajun He, Jie Zhang, Okan Yurduseven
Abstract: This work introduces FinGAN, a robust received signal strength (RSS) data generator designed to expand RSS fingerprint datasets. Compared to existing generative adversarial models that either rely on known reference positions (RPs) or depend on predefined priors, FinGAN learns the latent information between RPs and RSS values by maximizing the mutual information between the generated RSS data and the RPs, enabling an end-to-end RSS generation directly from RPs. This allows us to accurately generate RSS data for previously unmeasured RPs. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that FinGAN produces synthetic RSS data closely aligned with real RSS sample collected from the on-site experiment, preserving localization performance comparable to that achieved with complete real-world datasets. To further validate its generalizability, FinGAN is also trained and evaluated on open-source datasets from three typical office environments,and the results demonstrate consistent performance across different scenarios.

Title: Ultra-Reliable Risk-Aggregated Sum Rate Maximization via Model-Aided Deep Learning
Authors: Hassaan Hashmi, Spyridon Pougkakiotis, Dionysis Kalogerias
Abstract: We consider the problem of maximizing weighted sum rate in a multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink wireless network with emphasis on user rate reliability. We introduce a novel risk-aggregated formulation of the complex WSR maximization problem, which utilizes the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as a functional for enforcing rate (ultra)-reliability over channel fading uncertainty/risk. We establish a WMMSE-like equivalence between the proposed precoding problem and a weighted risk-averse MSE problem, enabling us to design a tailored unfolded graph neural network (GNN) policy function approximation (PFA), named {\alpha}-Robust Graph Neural Network ({\alpha}RGNN), trained to maximize lower-tail (CVaR) rates resulting from adverse wireless channel realizations (e.g., deep fading, attenuation). We empirically demonstrate that a trained {\alpha}RGNN fully eliminates per user deep rate fades, and substantially and optimally reduces statistical user rate variability while retaining adequate ergodic performance.

Title: TAU: A Benchmark for Cultural Sound Understanding Beyond Semantics

Abstract: Large audio-language models are advancing rapidly, yet most evaluations emphasize speech or globally sourced sounds, overlooking culturally distinctive cues. This gap raises a critical question: can current models generalize to localized, non-semantic audio that communities instantly recognize but outsiders do not? To address this, we present TAU (Taiwan Audio Understanding), a benchmark of everyday Taiwanese "soundmarks." TAU is built through a pipeline combining curated sources, human editing, and LLM-assisted question generation, producing 702 clips and 1,794 multiple-choice items that cannot be solved by transcripts alone. Experiments show that state-of-the-art LALMs, including Gemini 2.5 and Qwen2-Audio, perform far below local humans. TAU demonstrates the need for localized benchmarks to reveal cultural blind spots, guide more equitable multimodal evaluation, and ensure models serve communities beyond the global mainstream.

Title: Transmitter-Side Beyond-Diagonal RIS-Enabled Integrated Sensing and Communications
Authors: Kexin Chen, Yijie Mao, Wonjae Shin
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RIS) have emerged as a promising technology for 6G wireless networks, offering more advanced control over electromagnetic wave propagation than conventional diagonal RIS. This paper proposes a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework that incorporates BD-RIS at the transmitter. This not only opens the door to enhanced sensing and communication performance, but also alleviates the need for large-scale fully digital radio frequency (RF) chains at the transmitter. Based on the proposed system model, we formulate a normalized weighted optimization problem to jointly design the active beamforming and the BD-RIS scattering matrix with the aim of jointly minimizing the trace of the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for sensing targets and maximizing the sum rate (SR) for communication users. To address this highly coupled optimization problem, we propose a novel and low-complexity iterative algorithm that efficiently solves the active beamforming and scattering matrix subproblems by transforming each into a series of tractable projection problems with closed-form solutions. Numerical results show the appealing capability of the transmitter-side BD-RIS-aided ISAC over conventional diagonal RIS-aided ISAC in enhancing both sensing and communication performance. Moreover, compared to the classic iterative algorithm, the proposed algorithm offers enhanced dual-functional performance while significantly reducing the computational complexity.

Title: A Physics-Informed Multi-Source Domain Adaptation Framework for Label-Free Post-Earthquake Damage Assessment
Authors: Yifeng Zhang, Xiao Liang
Abstract: Efficient and intelligent assessment of post-earthquake structural damage is critical for rapid disaster response. While data-driven approaches have shown promise, traditional supervised learning methods rely on extensive labeled datasets, which are often impractical to obtain for damaged structures. To address this limitation, we propose a physics-informed multi-source domain adaptation framework to predict post-earthquake structural damage for a target building without requiring damage labels. The multi-source domain integrates actual damage data and numerical modeling data from buildings similar to the target structure. The framework operates through three key steps. First, the similarity of key physics from each domain are analyzed to form a weight matrix, which enhances domain differentiation. Second, features from the multi-source and target domains are extracted and fed into a classifier and a discriminator. The classifier ensures that the features are damage-sensitive and accurately assign damage states, while the discriminator enforces that the features remain domain-invariant. Finally, the key parameters matrix is applied as weights during adversarial training to optimize the contribution of features from each source domain. The proposed framework provides a robust solution for assessing structural damage in scenarios where labeled data is scarce, significantly advancing the capabilities of post-earthquake damage evaluation.

Title: Game-Time: Evaluating Temporal Dynamics in Spoken Language Models
Authors: Kai-Wei Chang, En-Pei Hu, Chun-Yi Kuan, Wenze Ren, Wei-Chih Chen, Guan-Ting Lin, Yu Tsao, Shao-Hua Sun, Hung-yi Lee, James Glass
Abstract: Conversational Spoken Language Models (SLMs) are emerging as a promising paradigm for real-time speech interaction. However, their capacity of temporal dynamics, including the ability to manage timing, tempo and simultaneous speaking, remains a critical and unevaluated challenge for conversational fluency. To address this gap, we introduce the Game-Time Benchmark, a framework to systematically assess these temporal capabilities. Inspired by how humans learn a language through language activities, Game-Time consists of basic instruction-following tasks and advanced tasks with temporal constraints, such as tempo adherence and synchronized responses. Our evaluation of diverse SLM architectures reveals a clear performance disparity: while state-of-the-art models handle basic tasks well, many contemporary systems still struggle with fundamental instruction-following. More critically, nearly all models degrade substantially under temporal constraints, exposing persistent weaknesses in time awareness and full-duplex interaction. The Game-Time Benchmark provides a foundation for guiding future research toward more temporally-aware conversational AI. Demos and datasets are available on our project website this https URL.

Title: A solution to the mystery of the sub-harmonic series and to the combination tone via a linear mathematical model of the cochlea
Authors: Ugo Boscain (SU, CNRS, CaGE, LJLL (UMR\_7598)), Xiangyu Ma (SU, CNRS, CaGE, LJLL (UMR\_7598)), Dario Prandi (L2S, CNRS), Giuseppina Turco (LLF - UMR7110, CNRS, UPCité)
Abstract: In this paper, we study a simple linear model of the cochlea as a set of vibrating strings. We make hypothesis that the information sent to the auditory cortex is the energy stored in the strings and consider all oscillation modes of the strings. We show the emergence of the sub-harmonic series whose existence was hypothesized in the XVI century to explain the consonance of the minor chord. We additionally show how the nonlinearity of the energy can be used to study the emergence of the combination tone (Tartini's third sound) shedding new light on this long debated subject.

Title: Assessment of East-West (E-W) and South-North (S-N) facing Vertical Bifacial Photovoltaic Modules for Agrivoltaics and Dual-Land Use Applications in India
Authors: Nishant Kumar, Shravan Kumar Singh, Nikhil Chander
Abstract: Deploying vertical bifacial PV modules can play a significant role in agrivoltaics, fencing walls, noise barriers, building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), solar PV for electric vehicles, and many other applications. This research work presents the performance comparison of vertical bifacial photovoltaic (VBPV) modules facing East-West (E-W) and South-North (S-N) directions. Also, the VBPV modules are compared with vertical and tilted south-facing monofacial PV modules. Six PV modules (monofacial and bifacial) were installed at the rooftop of IIT Bhilai academic building, Raipur (21.16° N, 81.65° E), India, and studied for a year from May 2022 to April 2023. The results show that the E-W facing VBPV module gives two production peaks, one in the morning and another in the evening, as compared to the single notable rise at midday observed for a monofacial module. From a series of experiments, 19 days of data were collected over the one-year period from May 2022 to April 2023, with specific inclusion of important days like solstices and equinoxes. In addition, the energy generation results are compared with PVsyst simulations, while also addressing the limitations of the PVsyst simulation of vertical PV modules. E-W bifacial generation is higher than S-N bifacial and south-facing monofacial modules from February to April. The VBPV modules in E-W and S-N orientations present a promising opportunity for expanding the agrivoltaics sector in tropical and sub-tropical countries, like India. This has huge implications for addressing the sustainable development goals by simultaneously contributing to sustainable land management, green energy generation, energy security and water conservation in the vast geo-climatic expanse of tropics.

Title: IR-UWB Radar-Based Contactless Silent Speech Recognition with Attention-Enhanced Temporal Convolutional Networks
Authors: Sunghwa Lee, Jaewon Yu
Abstract: Silent speech recognition (SSR) is a technology that recognizes speech content from non-acoustic speech-related biosignals. This paper utilizes an attention-enhanced temporal convolutional network architecture for contactless IR-UWB radar-based SSR, leveraging deep learning to learn discriminative representations directly from minimally processed radar signals. The architecture integrates temporal convolutions with self-attention and squeeze-and-excitation mechanisms to capture articulatory patterns. Evaluated on a 50-word recognition task using leave-one-session-out cross-validation, our approach achieves an average test accuracy of 91.1\% compared to 74.0\% for the conventional hand-crafted feature method, demonstrating significant improvement through end-to-end learning.

Title: Stabilization of nonlinear systems with unknown delays via delay-adaptive neural operator approximate predictors
Authors: Luke Bhan, Miroslav Krstic, Yuanyuan Shi
Abstract: This work establishes the first rigorous stability guarantees for approximate predictors in delay-adaptive control of nonlinear systems, addressing a key challenge in practical implementations where exact predictors are unavailable. We analyze two scenarios: (i) when the actuated input is directly measurable, and (ii) when it is estimated online. For the measurable input case, we prove semi-global practical asymptotic stability with an explicit bound proportional to the approximation error $\epsilon$. For the unmeasured input case, we demonstrate local practical asymptotic stability, with the region of attraction explicitly dependent on both the initial delay estimate and the predictor approximation error. To bridge theory and practice, we show that neural operators-a flexible class of neural network-based approximators-can achieve arbitrarily small approximation errors, thus satisfying the conditions of our stability theorems. Numerical experiments on two nonlinear benchmark systems-a biological protein activator/repressor model and a micro-organism growth Chemostat model-validate our theoretical results. In particular, our numerical simulations confirm stability under approximate predictors, highlight the strong generalization capabilities of neural operators, and demonstrate a substantial computational speedup of up to 15x compared to a baseline fixed-point method.

Title: On Deepfake Voice Detection - It's All in the Presentation
Authors: Héctor Delgado, Giorgio Ramondetti, Emanuele Dalmasso, Gennady Karvitsky, Daniele Colibro, Haydar Talib
Abstract: While the technologies empowering malicious audio deepfakes have dramatically evolved in recent years due to generative AI advances, the same cannot be said of global research into spoofing (deepfake) countermeasures. This paper highlights how current deepfake datasets and research methodologies led to systems that failed to generalize to real world application. The main reason is due to the difference between raw deepfake audio, and deepfake audio that has been presented through a communication channel, e.g. by phone. We propose a new framework for data creation and research methodology, allowing for the development of spoofing countermeasures that would be more effective in real-world scenarios. By following the guidelines outlined here we improved deepfake detection accuracy by 39% in more robust and realistic lab setups, and by 57% on a real-world benchmark. We also demonstrate how improvement in datasets would have a bigger impact on deepfake detection accuracy than the choice of larger SOTA models would over smaller models; that is, it would be more important for the scientific community to make greater investment on comprehensive data collection programs than to simply train larger models with higher computational demands.

Title: Anticipatory Structure in the Propagation of Signal
Authors: M.R. Sayeh, R.E. Auxier
Abstract: We here report the development of a structure that shows the proteresis phenomenon in more general setting and set out its philosophical implications. In this case, the questions relate to how we are to interpret what will happen in the future, and the procollection (the counterpart of recollection) of not-yet-experienced phenomena that, when expressed, will be whatever has built up in fully determinate form already, ahead of the event. If such a process really exists, as our evidence confirms, not just as phenomenon but as a fact, then a gap exists between the actualized form of the future and its concrete expression when the event does happen. Such a fact, as hard to imagine as it is, may be intelligible, even interpretable and susceptible to mathematical and/or logical modeling. We build upon neglected theories and formulae that present time in a way that makes our results interpretable. A proteretic device is here described which shifts the input signal (event) to the future; and it is an anticipatory structure. The proteretic characteristic of neurons should also be capable of demonstration; and its neuronal behavior is possibly the reason for the fast perception/thought processes in spite of slow behaving neurons. That capacity may also account for why it is possible for animals (including humans) to interact with the environment by slightly seeing (in the sense of perceiving and/or sensing) the future. Exploiting this new proteretic technology, faster computers and more efficient cellphones, among other things, will be designed and built.

Title: Indoor/Outdoor Spectrum Sharing Enabled by GNSS-based Classifiers
Authors: Hossein Nasiri, Muhammad Iqbal Rochman, Monisha Ghosh
Abstract: The desirability of the mid-band frequency range (1 - 10 GHz) for federal and commercial applications, combined with the growing applications for commercial indoor use-cases, such as factory automation, opens up a new approach to spectrum sharing: the same frequency bands used outdoors by federal incumbents can be reused by commercial indoor users. A recent example of such sharing, between commercial systems, is the 6 GHz band (5.925 - 7.125 GHz) where unlicensed, low-power-indoor (LPI) users share the band with outdoor incumbents, primarily fixed microwave links. However, to date, there exist no reliable, automatic means of determining whether a device is indoors or outdoors, necessitating the use of other mechanisms such as mandating indoor access points (APs) to have integrated antennas and not be battery powered, and reducing transmit power of client devices which may be outdoors. An accurate indoor/outdoor (I/O) classification addresses these challenges, enabling automatic transmit power adjustments without interfering with incumbents. To this end, we leverage the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals for I/O classification. GNSS signals, designed inherently for outdoor reception and highly susceptible to indoor attenuation and blocking, provide a robust and distinguishing feature for environmental sensing. We develop various methodologies, including threshold-based techniques and machine learning approaches and evaluate them using an expanded dataset gathered from diverse geographical locations. Our results demonstrate that GNSS-based methods alone can achieve greater accuracy than approaches relying solely on wireless (Wi-Fi) data, particularly in unfamiliar locations. Furthermore, the integration of GNSS data with Wi-Fi information leads to improved classification accuracy, showcasing the significant benefits of multi-modal data fusion.

Title: GastroViT: A Vision Transformer Based Ensemble Learning Approach for Gastrointestinal Disease Classification with Grad CAM & SHAP Visualization
Authors: Sumaiya Tabassum, Md. Faysal Ahamed, Hafsa Binte Kibria, Md. Nahiduzzaman, Julfikar Haider, Muhammad E. H. Chowdhury, Mohammad Tariqul Islam
Abstract: The gastrointestinal (GI) tract of humans can have a wide variety of aberrant mucosal abnormality findings, ranging from mild irritations to extremely fatal illnesses. Prompt identification of gastrointestinal disorders greatly contributes to arresting the progression of the illness and improving therapeutic outcomes. This paper presents an ensemble of pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs) for accurately classifying endoscopic images of the GI tract to categorize gastrointestinal problems and illnesses. ViTs, attention-based neural networks, have revolutionized image recognition by leveraging the transformative power of the transformer architecture, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across various visual tasks. The proposed model was evaluated on the publicly available HyperKvasir dataset with 10,662 images of 23 different GI diseases for the purpose of identifying GI tract diseases. An ensemble method is proposed utilizing the predictions of two pre-trained models, MobileViT_XS and MobileViT_V2_200, which achieved accuracies of 90.57% and 90.48%, respectively. All the individual models are outperformed by the ensemble model, GastroViT, with an average precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy of 69%, 63%, 64%, and 91.98%, respectively, in the first testing that involves 23 classes. The model comprises only 20 million (M) parameters, even without data augmentation and despite the highly imbalanced dataset. For the second testing with 16 classes, the scores are even higher, with average precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy of 87%, 86%, 87%, and 92.70%, respectively. Additionally, the incorporation of explainable AI (XAI) methods such as Grad-CAM (Gradient Weighted Class Activation Mapping) and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) enhances model interpretability, providing valuable insights for reliable GI diagnosis in real-world settings.

Title: Neural Network-Based Single-Carrier Joint Communication and Sensing: Loss Design, Constellation Shaping and Precoding
Authors: Charlotte Muth, Benedikt Geiger, Daniel Gil Gaviria, Laurent Schmalen
Abstract: We investigate the impact of higher-order modulation formats on the sensing performance of single-carrier joint communication and sensing (JCAS) systems. Several separate components such as a beamformer, a modulator, a target detector, an angle of arrival (AoA) estimator and a communication demapper are implemented as trainable neural networks (NNs). We compare geometrically shaped modulation formats to a classical quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) scheme. We assess the influence of multi-snapshot sensing and varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on the overall performance of the autoencoder-based system. To improve the training behavior of the system, we decouple the loss functions from the respective SNR values and the number of sensing snapshots, using upper bounds of the sensing and communication performance, namely the Cramér-Rao bound for AoA estimation and the mutual information for communication. The NN-based sensing outperforms classical algorithms, such as a Neyman-Pearson based power detector for object detection and ESPRIT for AoA estimation for both the trained constellations and QAM at low SNRs. We show that the gap in sensing performance between classical and shaped modulation formats can be significantly reduced through multi-snapshot sensing. Lastly, we demonstrate system extension to multi-user multiple-input multiple-output to address the improvement of spatial efficiency when servicing multiple user equipments. Our contribution emphasizes the importance of estimation bounds for training neural networks, especially when the trained solutions are deployed in varying SNR conditions.

Title: Voice Evaluation of Reasoning Ability: Diagnosing the Modality-Induced Performance Gap
Authors: Yueqian Lin, Zhengmian Hu, Qinsi Wang, Yudong Liu, Hengfan Zhang, Jayakumar Subramanian, Nikos Vlassis, Hai Helen Li, Yiran Chen
Abstract: We present Voice Evaluation of Reasoning Ability (VERA), a benchmark for evaluating reasoning ability in voice-interactive systems under real-time conversational constraints. VERA comprises 2,931 voice-native episodes derived from established text benchmarks and organized into five tracks (Math, Web, Science, Long-Context, Factual). Each item is adapted for speech interaction while preserving reasoning difficulty. VERA enables direct text-voice comparison within model families and supports analysis of how architectural choices affect reliability. We assess 12 contemporary voice systems alongside strong text baselines and observe large, consistent modality gaps: on competition mathematics a leading text model attains 74.8% accuracy while its voice counterpart reaches 6.1%; macro-averaged across tracks the best text models achieve 54.0% versus 11.3% for voice. Latency-accuracy analyses reveal a low-latency plateau, where fast voice systems cluster around ~10% accuracy, while approaching text performance requires sacrificing real-time interaction. Diagnostic experiments indicate that common mitigations are insufficient. Increasing "thinking time" yields negligible gains; a decoupled cascade that separates reasoning from narration improves accuracy but still falls well short of text and introduces characteristic grounding/consistency errors. Failure analyses further show distinct error signatures across native streaming, end-to-end, and cascade designs. VERA provides a reproducible testbed and targeted diagnostics for architectures that decouple thinking from speaking, offering a principled way to measure progress toward real-time voice assistants that are both fluent and reliably reasoned.

Title: Secure ISAC with Fluid Antenna Systems: Joint Precoding and Port Selection
Authors: Abdelhamid Salem, Hao Xu, Kai-Kit Wong, Chan-Byoung Chae, Yangyang Zhang
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for enhancing physical-layer security in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems by leveraging the reconfigurability of fluid antenna systems (FAS). We propose a joint precoding and port selection (JPPS) strategy that maximizes the sum secrecy rate while simultaneously ensuring reliable radar sensing. The problem is formulated using fractional programming (FP) and solved through an iterative algorithm that integrates FP transformations with successive convex approximation (SCA). To reduce computational complexity, we further develop low-complexity schemes based on zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, combined with greedy port selection and trace-inverse minimization. Simulation results demonstrate substantial improvements in both secrecy performance and sensing accuracy compared to conventional baselines, across a wide range of FAS ports, user loads, and sensing targets. These findings highlight the critical importance of FAS geometry optimization in enabling secure and efficient joint communication-sensing for next-generation wireless networks.

Title: Statistical Inference Framework for Extended Target Detection in mmWave Automotive Radar
Authors: Vinay Kulkarni, V. V. Reddy, Neha Maheshwari
Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) radar systems, owing to their large bandwidth, provide fine range resolution that enables the observation of multiple scatterers originating from a single automotive target commonly referred to as an extended target. Conventional CFAR-based detection algorithms typically treat these scatterers as independent detections, thereby discarding the spatial scattering structure intrinsic to the target. To preserve this scattering spread, this paper proposes a Range-Doppler (RD) segment framework designed to encapsulate the typical scattering profile of an automobile. The statistical characterization of the segment is performed using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and posterior density modeling facilitated through Gibbs Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. A skewness-based test statistic, derived from the estimated statistical model, is introduced for binary hypothesis classification of extended targets. Additionally, the paper presents a detection pipeline that incorporates Intersection over Union (IoU) and segment centering based on peak response, optimized to work within a single dwell. Extensive evaluations using both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, underscoring its suitability for automotive radar applications through improved detection accuracy.

Title: Neural Network-based Co-design of Output-Feedback Control Barrier Function and Observer
Authors: Vaishnavi Jagabathula, Ahan Basu, Pushpak Jagtap
Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide a powerful framework for ensuring safety in dynamical systems. However, their application typically relies on full state information, which is often violated in real-world scenarios due to the availability of partial state information. In this work, we propose a neural network-based framework for the co-design of a safety controller, observer, and CBF for partially observed continuous-time systems. By formulating barrier conditions over an augmented state space, our approach ensures safety without requiring bounded estimation errors or handcrafted barrier functions. All components are jointly trained by formulating appropriate loss functions, and we introduce a validity condition to provide formal safety guarantees beyond the training data. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through several case studies.

Title: Robust Safety-Critical Control of Integrator Chains with Mismatched Perturbations via Linear Time-Varying Feedback
Authors: Imtiaz Ur Rehman Moussa Labbadi, Amine Abadi, Lew Lew Yan Voon
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel safety-critical control framework for a chain of integrators subject to both matched and mismatched perturbations. The core of our approach is a linear, time-varying state-feedback design that simultaneously enforces stability and safety constraints. By integrating backstepping techniques with a quadratic programming (QP) formulation, we develop a systematic procedure to guarantee safety under time-varying gains. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for the double integrator case, both in the presence and absence of perturbations, and outline general proofs for extending the methodology to higher-order chains of integrators. This proposed framework thus bridges robustness and safety-critical performance, while overcoming the limitations of existing prescribed-time approaches.

Title: Energy-Optimal Planning of Waypoint-Based UAV Missions -- Does Minimum Distance Mean Minimum Energy?
Authors: Nicolas Michel, Ayush Patnaik, Zhaodan Kong, Xinfan Lin
Abstract: Multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle is a prevailing type of aerial robots with wide real-world applications. The energy efficiency of the robot is a critical aspect of its performance, determining the range and duration of the missions that can be performed. This paper studies the energy-optimal planning of the multirotor, which aims at finding the optimal ordering of waypoints with the minimum energy consumption for missions in 3D space. The study is performed based on a previously developed model capturing first-principle energy dynamics of the multirotor. We found that in majority of the cases (up to 95%) the solutions of the energy-optimal planning are different from those of the traditional traveling salesman problem which minimizes the total distance. The difference can be as high as 14.9%, with the average at 1.6%-3.3% and 90th percentile at 3.7%-6.5% depending on the range and number of waypoints in the mission. We then identified and explained the key features of the minimum-energy order by correlating to the underlying flight energy dynamics. It is shown that instead of minimizing the distance, coordination of vertical and horizontal motion to promote aerodynamic efficiency is the key to optimizing energy consumption.

Title: Anomaly detection by partitioning of multi-variate time series
Authors: Pierre Lotte (IRIT, IRIT-SIG, UT, UT3), André Péninou (IRIT, IRIT-SIG, UT2J), Olivier Teste (IRIT-SIG, IRIT, UT2J, UT)
Abstract: In this article, we suggest a novel non-supervised partition based anomaly detection method for anomaly detection in multivariate time series called PARADISE. This methodology creates a partition of the variables of the time series while ensuring that the inter-variable relations remain untouched. This partitioning relies on the clustering of multiple correlation coefficients between variables to identify subsets of variables before executing anomaly detection algorithms locally for each of those subsets. Through multiple experimentations done on both synthetic and real datasets coming from the literature, we show the relevance of our approach with a significant improvement in anomaly detection performance.

Title: The Causal Abstraction Network: Theory and Learning
Authors: Gabriele D'Acunto, Paolo Di Lorenzo, Sergio Barbarossa
Abstract: Causal artificial intelligence aims to enhance explainability, trustworthiness, and robustness in AI by leveraging structural causal models (SCMs). In this pursuit, recent advances formalize network sheaves of causal knowledge. Pushing in the same direction, we introduce the causal abstraction network (CAN), a specific instance of such sheaves where (i) SCMs are Gaussian, (ii) restriction maps are transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions (CAs), and (iii) edge stalks correspond -- up to rotation -- to the node stalks of more detailed SCMs. We investigate the theoretical properties of CAN, including algebraic invariants, cohomology, consistency, global sections characterized via the Laplacian kernel, and smoothness. We then tackle the learning of consistent CANs. Our problem formulation separates into edge-specific local Riemannian problems and avoids nonconvex, costly objectives. We propose an efficient search procedure as a solution, solving the local problems with SPECTRAL, our iterative method with closed-form updates and suitable for positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices. Experiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in the CA learning task, and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.

Title: Neo-Grounded Theory: A Methodological Innovation Integrating High-Dimensional Vector Clustering and Multi-Agent Collaboration for Qualitative Research
Authors: Shuide Wen, Beier Ku, Teng Wang, Mingyang Zou, Yang Yang
Abstract: Purpose: Neo Grounded Theory (NGT) integrates vector clustering with multi agent systems to resolve qualitative research's scale depth paradox, enabling analysis of massive datasets in hours while preserving interpretive rigor. Methods: We compared NGT against manual coding and ChatGPT-assisted analysis using 40,000 character Chinese interview transcripts. NGT employs 1536-dimensional embeddings, hierarchical clustering, and parallel agent-based coding. Two experiments tested pure automation versus human guided refinement. Findings: NGT achieved 168-fold speed improvement (3 hours vs 3 weeks), superior quality (0.904 vs 0.883), and 96% cost reduction. Human AI collaboration proved essential: automation alone produced abstract frameworks while human guidance yielded actionable dual pathway theories. The system discovered patterns invisible to manual coding, including identity bifurcation phenomena. Contributions: NGT demonstrates computational objectivity and human interpretation are complementary. Vector representations provide reproducible semantic measurement while preserving meaning's interpretive dimensions. Researchers shift from mechanical coding to theoretical guidance, with AI handling pattern recognition while humans provide creative insight. Implications: Cost reduction from \$50,000 to \$500 democratizes qualitative research, enabling communities to study themselves. Real-time analysis makes qualitative insights contemporaneous with events. The framework shows computational methods can strengthen rather than compromise qualitative research's humanistic commitments. Keywords: Grounded theory; Vector embeddings; Multi agent systems; Human AI collaboration; Computational qualitative analysis

Title: AW-EL-PINNs: A Multi-Task Learning Physics-Informed Neural Network for Euler-Lagrange Systems in Optimal Control Problems
Authors: Chuandong Li, Runtian Zeng
Abstract: This paper presents adaptive weighted Euler-Lagrange theorem combined physics-informed neural networks (AW-EL-PINNs) for solving Euler-Lagrange systems in optimal control problems. The framework systematically converts optimal control frameworks into two-point boundary value problems (TPBVPs) while establishing a multi-task learning paradigm through innovative integration of the Euler-Lagrange theorem with deep learning architecture. An adaptive loss weighting mechanism dynamically balances loss function components during training, decreasing tedious manual tuning of weighting the loss functions compared to the conventional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Based on six numerical examples, it's clear that AW-EL-PINNs achieve enhanced solution accuracy compared to baseline methods while maintaining stability throughout the optimization process. These results highlight the framework's capability to improve precision and ensure stability in solving Euler-Lagrange systems in optimal control problems, offering potential strategies for problems under physical applications.

Title: VoiceBridge: Designing Latent Bridge Models for General Speech Restoration at Scale
Authors: Chi Zhang, Zehua Chen, Kaiwen Zheng, Jun Zhu
Abstract: Bridge models have recently been explored for speech enhancement tasks such as denoising, dereverberation, and super-resolution, while these efforts are typically confined to a single task or small-scale datasets, with constrained general speech restoration (GSR) capability at scale. In this work, we introduce VoiceBridge, a GSR system rooted in latent bridge models (LBMs), capable of reconstructing high-fidelity speech at full-band (\textit{i.e.,} 48~kHz) from various distortions. By compressing speech waveform into continuous latent representations, VoiceBridge models the~\textit{diverse LQ-to-HQ tasks} (namely, low-quality to high-quality) in GSR with~\textit{a single latent-to-latent generative process} backed by a scalable transformer architecture. To better inherit the advantages of bridge models from the data domain to the latent space, we present an energy-preserving variational autoencoder, enhancing the alignment between the waveform and latent space over varying energy levels. Furthermore, to address the difficulty of HQ reconstruction from distinctively different LQ priors, we propose a joint neural prior, uniformly alleviating the reconstruction burden of LBM. At last, considering the key requirement of GSR systems, human perceptual quality, a perceptually aware fine-tuning stage is designed to mitigate the cascading mismatch in generation while improving perceptual alignment. Extensive validation across in-domain and out-of-domain tasks and datasets (\textit{e.g.}, refining recent zero-shot speech and podcast generation results) demonstrates the superior performance of VoiceBridge.

Title: Optimisation of Resource Allocation in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks Using Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Oluwaseyi Giwa, Jonathan Shock, Jaco Du Toit, Tobi Awodumila
Abstract: Dynamic resource allocation in heterogeneous wireless networks (HetNets) is challenging for traditional methods under varying user loads and channel conditions. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that jointly optimises transmit power, bandwidth, and scheduling via a multi-objective reward balancing throughput, energy efficiency, and fairness. Using real base station coordinates, we compare Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) against three heuristic algorithms in multiple network scenarios. Our results show that DRL frameworks outperform heuristic algorithms in optimising resource allocation in dynamic networks. These findings highlight key trade-offs in DRL design for future HetNets.

Title: Learning Relationships Between Separate Audio Tracks for Creative Applications
Authors: Balthazar Bujard (IRCAM, SU), Jérôme Nika (IRCAM), Fédéric Bevilacqua (IRCAM), Nicolas Obin
Abstract: This paper presents the first step in a research project situated within the field of musical agents. The objective is to achieve, through training, the tuning of the desired musical relationship between a live musical input and a real-time generated musical output, through the curation of a database of separated tracks. We propose an architecture integrating a symbolic decision module capable of learning and exploiting musical relationships from such musical corpus. We detail an offline implementation of this architecture employing Transformers as the decision module, associated with a perception module based on Wav2Vec 2.0, and concatenative synthesis as audio renderer. We present a quantitative evaluation of the decision module's ability to reproduce learned relationships extracted during training. We demonstrate that our decision module can predict a coherent track B when conditioned by its corresponding ''guide'' track A, based on a corpus of paired tracks (A, B).

Title: VisualOverload: Probing Visual Understanding of VLMs in Really Dense Scenes
Authors: Paul Gavrikov, Wei Lin, M. Jehanzeb Mirza, Soumya Jahagirdar, Muhammad Huzaifa, Sivan Doveh, Serena Yeung-Levy, James Glass, Hilde Kuehne
Abstract: Is basic visual understanding really solved in state-of-the-art VLMs? We present VisualOverload, a slightly different visual question answering (VQA) benchmark comprising 2,720 question-answer pairs, with privately held ground-truth responses. Unlike prior VQA datasets that typically focus on near global image understanding, VisualOverload challenges models to perform simple, knowledge-free vision tasks in densely populated (or, overloaded) scenes. Our dataset consists of high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings that are populated with multiple figures, actions, and unfolding subplots set against elaborately detailed backdrops. We manually annotated these images with questions across six task categories to probe for a thorough understanding of the scene. We hypothesize that current benchmarks overestimate the performance of VLMs, and encoding and reasoning over details is still a challenging task for them, especially if they are confronted with densely populated scenes. Indeed, we observe that even the best model (o3) out of 37 tested models only achieves 19.6% accuracy on our hardest test split and overall 69.5% accuracy on all questions. Beyond a thorough evaluation, we complement our benchmark with an error analysis that reveals multiple failure modes, including a lack of counting skills, failure in OCR, and striking logical inconsistencies under complex tasks. Altogether, VisualOverload exposes a critical gap in current vision models and offers a crucial resource for the community to develop better models. Benchmark: this http URL

Title: Fast Energy-Theft Attack on Frequency-Varying Wireless Power without Additional Sensors
Authors: Hui Wang, Nima Tashakor, Xiaoyang Tian, Hans D. Schotten, Stefan M. Goetz
Abstract: With the popularity of wireless charging, energy access protection and cybersecurity are gaining importance, especially in public places. Currently, the most common energy encryption method uses frequency and associated impedance variation. However, we have proven that this method is not reliable, since a hacker can detect the changing frequency and adjust the compensation. However, the previously presented system needed time to follow the updated frequency, while encryption systems may vary the frequency faster to avoid energy theft. Furthermore, the previous system required an additional sensor coil. To solve these problems, we optimized the attack and the associated system, which can intrude and steal energy within 0.2 ms. The key is the elimination of the time-consuming maximum receiver current regulation. Also, we use the main receiving coil rather than any additional sensor antenna to detect the magnetic field. Thus, the new hardware is even simpler. A simulation model and experimental results demonstrate the fast response speed of the attack on encrypted wireless power and steal 65% of the power. Overall, the applicability of the attack is highly improved and leaves less room for hardening the encryption. The results demonstrate that energy access protection needs to be given great attention.

Title: Secure Beamforming in Multi-User Multi-IRS Millimeter Wave Systems
Authors: Anahid Rafieifar, Hosein Ahmadinejad, S. Mohammad Razavizadeh, Jiguang He
Abstract: We study the secrecy rate maximization problem in a millimeter wave (mmWave) network, consisting of a base station (BS), multiple intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) (or reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)), multiple users, and a single eavesdropper. To ensure a fair secrecy rate among all the users, we adopt a max-min fairness criterion which results in a mixed integer problem. We first relax discrete IRSs phase shifts to the continuous ones. To cope with the non-convexity of the relaxed optimization problem, we leverage the penalty method and block coordinate descent approach to divide it into two sub-problems, which are solved by successive convex approximation (SCA). Then, we propose a low-complexity mapping algorithm where feasible IRSs phase shifts are obtained. Mathematical evaluation shows the convergence of sub-problems to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the original ones. Furthermore, the convergence guarantee of the overall proposed algorithm and computational complexity are investigated. Finally, simulation results show our proposed algorithm outweighs the conventional solutions based on the semi-definite programming (SDP) in terms of convergence and secrecy rate, especially in a larger number of IRSs and phase shifts where SDP suffers from rank-one approximation. Maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and IRS-free systems are also considered as other benchmarks.

Title: Environmental Rate Manipulation Attacks on Power Grid Security
Authors: Yonatan Gizachew Achamyeleh, Yang Xiang, Yun-Ping Hsiao, Yasamin Moghaddas, Mohammad Abdullah Al Faruque
Abstract: The growing complexity of global supply chains has made hardware Trojans a significant threat in sensor-based power electronics. Traditional Trojan designs depend on digital triggers or fixed threshold conditions that can be detected during standard testing. In contrast, we introduce Environmental Rate Manipulation (ERM), a novel Trojan triggering mechanism that activates by monitoring the rate of change in environmental parameters rather than their absolute values. This approach allows the Trojan to remain inactive under normal conditions and evade redundancy and sensor-fusion defenses. We implement a compact 14~$\mu$m$^2$ circuit that measures capacitor charging rates in standard sensor front-ends and disrupts inverter pulse-width modulation PWM signals when a rapid change is induced. Experiments on a commercial Texas Instruments solar inverter demonstrate that ERM can trigger catastrophic driver chip failure. Furthermore, ETAP simulations indicate that a single compromised 100~kW inverter may initiate cascading grid instabilities. The attack's significance extends beyond individual sensors to entire classes of environmental sensing systems common in power electronics, demonstrating fundamental challenges for hardware security.

Authors: Wouter M. Kouw, Tim N. Nisslbeck, Wouter L.N. Nuijten
Abstract: We present the design of an autoregressive active inference agent in the form of message passing on a factor graph. Expected free energy is derived and distributed across a planning graph. The proposed agent is validated on a robot navigation task, demonstrating exploration and exploitation in a continuous-valued observation space with bounded continuous-valued actions. Compared to a classical optimal controller, the agent modulates action based on predictive uncertainty, arriving later but with a better model of the robot's dynamics.

Title: World Model for AI Autonomous Navigation in Mechanical Thrombectomy
Authors: Harry Robertshaw, Han-Ru Wu, Alejandro Granados, Thomas C Booth
Abstract: Autonomous navigation for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) remains a critical challenge due to the complexity of vascular anatomy and the need for precise, real-time decision-making. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches have demonstrated potential in automating endovascular navigation, but current methods often struggle with generalization across multiple patient vasculatures and long-horizon tasks. We propose a world model for autonomous endovascular navigation using TD-MPC2, a model-based RL algorithm. We trained a single RL agent across multiple endovascular navigation tasks in ten real patient vasculatures, comparing performance against the state-of-the-art Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) method. Results indicate that TD-MPC2 significantly outperforms SAC in multi-task learning, achieving a 65% mean success rate compared to SAC's 37%, with notable improvements in path ratio. TD-MPC2 exhibited increased procedure times, suggesting a trade-off between success rate and execution speed. These findings highlight the potential of world models for improving autonomous endovascular navigation and lay the foundation for future research in generalizable AI-driven robotic interventions.

Title: Exhaustive-Serve-Longest Control for Multi-robot Scheduling Systems
Authors: Mohammad Merati, David Castañón
Abstract: We study online task allocation for multi-robot, multi-queue systems with stochastic arrivals and switching delays. Time is slotted; each location can host at most one robot per slot; service consumes one slot; switching between locations incurs a one-slot travel delay; and arrivals are independent Bernoulli processes. We formulate a discounted-cost Markov decision process and propose Exhaustive-Serve-Longest (ESL), a simple real-time policy that serves exhaustively when the current location is nonempty and, when idle, switches to a longest unoccupied nonempty location, and we prove the optimality of this policy. As baselines, we tune a fixed-dwell cyclic policy via a discrete-time delay expression and implement a first-come-first-serve policy. Across server-to-location ratios and loads, ESL consistently yields lower discounted holding cost and smaller mean queue lengths, with action-time fractions showing more serving and restrained switching. Its simplicity and robustness make ESL a practical default for real-time multi-robot scheduling systems.

Title: Inverse Optimal Feedback and Gain Margins for Unicycle Stabilization
Authors: Kwang Hak Kim, Velimir Todorovski, Miroslav Krstić
Abstract: The recent development of globally strict control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) for the challenging unicycle parking problem provides a foundation for pursuing optimality. We address this in the inverse optimal framework, thereby avoiding the need to solve the Hamilton$\unicode{x2013}$Jacobi$\unicode{x2013}$Bellman (HJB) equations, and establish a general result that is optimal with respect to a meaningful cost. We present several design examples that impose varying levels of penalty on the control effort, including arbitrarily bounded control. Furthermore, we show that the inverse optimal controller possesses an infinite gain margin thanks to the system being driftless, and leveraging this property, we extend the design to an adaptive controller that handles model uncertainty. Finally, we compare the performance of the non-adaptive inverse optimal controller with its adaptive counterpart.

Title: AttentionViG: Cross-Attention-Based Dynamic Neighbor Aggregation in Vision GNNs
Authors: Hakan Emre Gedik, Andrew Martin, Mustafa Munir, Oguzhan Baser, Radu Marculescu, Sandeep P. Chinchali, Alan C. Bovik
Abstract: Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) have demonstrated promising performance in image recognition tasks against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). An essential part of the ViG framework is the node-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution methods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been explored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex node-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements is needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation method in which the query projections come from the node, while the key projections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel architecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention aggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image recognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it achieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method not only achieves strong performance, but also maintains efficiency, delivering competitive accuracy with comparable FLOPs to prior vision GNN architectures.

Title: A General Theory of Emergent Linearity in Complex Dynamical Systems: The Role of Spatial Averaging and Vanishing Correlations
Authors: Sabbir Ahmed, Hafiz Fareed Ahmed, Erfan Nozari
Abstract: Various natural and engineered systems, from urban traffic flow to the human brain, have been described by large-scale networked dynamical systems. Despite their vast differences, these systems are often similar in being comprised of numerous microscopic subsystems with complex nonlinear dynamics and interactions that give rise to diverse emergent macroscopic behaviors. As such, a long-standing question across various fields has been to understand why and how various forms of macroscopic behavior emerge from underlying microscopic dynamics. Motivated by a growing body of empirical observations, in this work we focus on linearity as one of the most fundamental aspects of system dynamics, and develop a general theoretical framework for the interplay between spatial averaging, decaying microscopic correlations, and emergent macroscopic linearity. Using and extending the theory of mixing sequences, we show that in a broad class of autonomous nonlinear networked systems, the dynamics of the average of all subsystems' states becomes asymptotically linear as the number of subsystems grows to infinity, provided that (in addition to technical assumptions) pairwise correlations between subsystems decay to 0 as their pairwise distance grows to infinity. We prove this result when the latter distance is between subsystems' linear indices or spatial locations, and provide extensions to linear time-invariant (LTI) limit dynamics, finite-sample analysis of rates of convergence, and networks of spatially-embedded subsystems with random locations. To our knowledge, this work is the first rigorous analysis of macroscopic linearity in large-scale heterogeneous networked systems, and provides a solid foundation for further theoretical and empirical analyses in various domains of science and engineering.

Title: Unsupervised Detection of Spatiotemporal Anomalies in PMU Data Using Transformer-Based BiGAN
Authors: Muhammad Imran Hossain, Jignesh Solanki, Sarika Khushlani Solanki
Abstract: Ensuring power grid resilience requires the timely and unsupervised detection of anomalies in synchrophasor data streams. We introduce T-BiGAN, a novel framework that integrates window-attention Transformers within a bidirectional Generative Adversarial Network (BiGAN) to address this challenge. Its self-attention encoder-decoder architecture captures complex spatio-temporal dependencies across the grid, while a joint discriminator enforces cycle consistency to align the learned latent space with the true data distribution. Anomalies are flagged in real-time using an adaptive score that combines reconstruction error, latent space drift, and discriminator confidence. Evaluated on a realistic hardware-in-the-loop PMU benchmark, T-BiGAN achieves an ROC-AUC of 0.95 and an average precision of 0.996, significantly outperforming leading supervised and unsupervised methods. It shows particular strength in detecting subtle frequency and voltage deviations, demonstrating its practical value for live, wide-area monitoring without relying on manually labeled fault data.

Title: Policy Optimization in Robust Control: Weak Convexity and Subgradient Methods
Authors: Yuto Watanabe, Feng-Yi Liao, Yang Zheng
Abstract: Robust control seeks stabilizing policies that perform reliably under adversarial disturbances, with $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ control as a classical formulation. It is known that policy optimization of robust $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ control naturally lead to nonsmooth and nonconvex problems. This paper builds on recent advances in nonsmooth optimization to analyze discrete-time static output-feedback $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ control. We show that the $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ cost is weakly convex over any convex subset of a sublevel set. This structural property allows us to establish the first non-asymptotic deterministic convergence rate for the subgradient method under suitable assumptions. In addition, we prove a weak Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) inequality in the state-feedback case, implying that all stationary points are globally optimal. We finally present a few numerical examples to validate the theoretical results.

Title: YOLO-Based Defect Detection for Metal Sheets
Authors: Po-Heng Chou, Chun-Chi Wang, Wei-Lung Mao
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a YOLO-based deep learning (DL) model for automatic defect detection to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks in industrial manufacturing. In our experiments, the images of metal sheets are used as the dataset for training the YOLO model to detect the defects on the surfaces and in the holes of metal sheets. However, the lack of metal sheet images significantly degrades the performance of detection accuracy. To address this issue, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a considerable amount of data. Four versions of the YOLO model (i.e., YOLOv3, v4, v7, and v9) are combined with the ConSinGAN for data augmentation. The proposed YOLOv9 model with ConSinGAN outperforms the other YOLO models with an accuracy of 91.3%, and a detection time of 146 ms. The proposed YOLOv9 model is integrated into manufacturing hardware and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system to establish a practical automated optical inspection (AOI) system. Additionally, the proposed automated defect detection is easily applied to other components in industrial manufacturing.

Title: Capacity-Net-Based RIS Precoding Design without Channel Estimation for mmWave MIMO System
Authors: Chun-Yuan Huang, Po-Heng Chou, Wan-Jen Huang, Ying-Ren Chien, Yu Tsao
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Capacity-Net, a novel unsupervised learning approach aimed at maximizing the achievable rate in reflecting intelligent surface (RIS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems. To combat severe channel fading of the mmWave spectrum, we optimize the phase-shifting factors of the reflective elements in the RIS to enhance the achievable rate. However, most optimization algorithms rely heavily on complete and accurate channel state information (CSI), which is often challenging to acquire since the RIS is mostly composed of passive components. To circumvent this challenge, we leverage unsupervised learning techniques with implicit CSI provided by the received pilot signals. Specifically, it usually requires perfect CSI to evaluate the achievable rate as a performance metric of the current optimization result of the unsupervised learning method. Instead of channel estimation, the Capacity-Net is proposed to establish a mapping among the received pilot signals, optimized RIS phase shifts, and the resultant achievable rates. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed Capacity-Net-based unsupervised learning approach over learning methods based on traditional channel estimation.

Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Precoding for Multi-RIS-Aided Multiuser Downlink Systems with Practical Phase Shift
Authors: Po-Heng Chou, Bo-Ren Zheng, Wan-Jen Huang, Walid Saad, Yu Tsao, Ronald Y. Chang
Abstract: This study considers multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)-aided multiuser downlink systems with the goal of jointly optimizing the transmitter precoding and RIS phase shift matrix to maximize spectrum efficiency. Unlike prior work that assumed ideal RIS reflectivity, a practical coupling effect is considered between reflecting amplitude and phase shift for the RIS elements. This makes the optimization problem non-convex. To address this challenge, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. The proposed model is evaluated under both fixed and random numbers of users in practical mmWave channel settings. Simulation results demonstrate that, despite its complexity, the proposed DDPG approach significantly outperforms optimization-based algorithms and double deep Q-learning, particularly in scenarios with random user distributions.

Title: Field Calibration of Hyperspectral Cameras for Terrain Inference
Authors: Nathaniel Hanson, Benjamin Pyatski, Samuel Hibbard, Gary Lvov, Oscar De La Garza, Charles DiMarzio, Kristen L. Dorsey, Taşkın Padır
Abstract: Intra-class terrain differences such as water content directly influence a vehicle's ability to traverse terrain, yet RGB vision systems may fail to distinguish these properties. Evaluating a terrain's spectral content beyond red-green-blue wavelengths to the near infrared spectrum provides useful information for intra-class identification. However, accurate analysis of this spectral information is highly dependent on ambient illumination. We demonstrate a system architecture to collect and register multi-wavelength, hyperspectral images from a mobile robot and describe an approach to reflectance calibrate cameras under varying illumination conditions. To showcase the practical applications of our system, HYPER DRIVE, we demonstrate the ability to calculate vegetative health indices and soil moisture content from a mobile robot platform.

Title: Can VLM Pseudo-Labels Train a Time-Series QA Model That Outperforms the VLM?
Authors: Takuya Fujimura, Kota Dohi, Natsuo Yamashita, Yohei Kawaguchi
Abstract: Time-series question answering (TSQA) tasks face significant challenges due to the lack of labeled data. Alternatively, with recent advancements in large-scale models, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated the potential to analyze time-series signals in a zero-shot manner. In this paper, we propose a training approach that uses pseudo labels generated by a VLM. Although VLMs can produce incorrect labels, TSQA models can still be effectively trained based on the property that deep neural networks are inherently robust to such noisy labels. Our experimental results demonstrate that TSQA models are not only successfully trained with pseudo labels, but also surpass the performance of the VLM itself by leveraging a large amount of unlabeled data.

Title: Beyond Point Estimates: Likelihood-Based Full-Posterior Wireless Localization
Authors: Haozhe Lei, Hao Guo, Tommy Svensson, Sundeep Rangan
Abstract: Modern wireless systems require not only position estimates, but also quantified uncertainty to support planning, control, and radio resource management. We formulate localization as posterior inference of an unknown transmitter location from receiver measurements. We propose Monte Carlo Candidate-Likelihood Estimation (MC-CLE), which trains a neural scoring network using Monte Carlo sampling to compare true and candidate transmitter locations. We show that in line-of-sight simulations with a multi-antenna receiver, MC-CLE learns critical properties including angular ambiguity and front-to-back antenna patterns. MC-CLE also achieves lower cross-entropy loss relative to a uniform baseline and Gaussian posteriors. alternatives under a uniform-loss metric.

Title: Ingress Cryogenic Receivers Toward Scalable Quantum Information Processing: Theory and System Analysis
Authors: Malek Succar, Mohamed I. Ibrahim
Abstract: Current control techniques for cryogenically cooled qubits are realized with coaxial cables, posing multiple challenges in terms of cost, thermal load, size, and long-term scalability. Emerging approaches to tackle this issue include cryogenic CMOS electronics at 4 K, and photonic links for direct qubit control. In this paper, we propose a multiplexed all-passive cryogenic high frequency direct detection control platform (cryo-HFDD). The proposed classical interface for direct qubit control utilizes optical or sub-THz bands. We present the possible tradeoffs of this platform, and compare it with current state-of-the-art cryogenic CMOS and conventional coaxial approaches. We assess the feasibility of adopting these efficient links for a wide range of microwave qubit power levels. Specifically, we estimate the heat load to achieve the required signal-to-noise ratio SNR considering different noise sources, component losses, as well as link density. We show that multiplexed photonic receivers at 4 K can aggressively scale the control of thousands of qubits. This opens the door for low cost scalable quantum computing systems.

Title: Graph Distribution-valued Signals: A Wasserstein Space Perspective
Authors: Yanan Zhao, Feng Ji, Xingchao Jian, Wee Peng Tay
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for graph signal processing (GSP) that models signals as graph distribution-valued signals (GDSs), which are probability distributions in the Wasserstein space. This approach overcomes key limitations of classical vector-based GSP, including the assumption of synchronous observations over vertices, the inability to capture uncertainty, and the requirement for strict correspondence in graph filtering. By representing signals as distributions, GDSs naturally encode uncertainty and stochasticity, while strictly generalizing traditional graph signals. We establish a systematic dictionary mapping core GSP concepts to their GDS counterparts, demonstrating that classical definitions are recovered as special cases. The effectiveness of the framework is validated through graph filter learning for prediction tasks, supported by experimental results.

Abstract: IEEE 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7) introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO) as a While MLO offers significant parallelism and capacity, realizing its full potential in guaranteeing strict delay bounds and optimizing Quality of Service (QoS) for diverse, heterogeneous traffic streams in complex multi-link scenarios remain a significant challenge. This is largely due to the limitations of static Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) parameters and the complexity inherent in cross-link traffic management. To address this, this paper investigates the correlation between overall MLO QoS indicators and the configuration of EDCA parameters and Acess Catagory (AC) traffic allocation among links. Based on this analysis, we formulate a constrained optimization problem aiming to minimize the sum of overall packet loss rates for all access categories while satisfying their respective overall delay violation probability constraints. A Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based MLO EDCA QoS optimization algorithm is designed to efficiently search the complex configuration space of AC assignments and EDCA parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach's efficacy in generating adaptive MLO configuration strategies that align with diverse service requirements. The proposed solution significantly improves delay distribution characteristics, and enhance QoS robustness and resource utilization efficiency in high-load MLO environments.

Title: LiDAR Point Cloud Colourisation Using Multi-Camera Fusion and Low-Light Image Enhancement
Authors: Pasindu Ranasinghe, Dibyayan Patra, Bikram Banerjee, Simit Raval
Abstract: In recent years, the fusion of camera data with LiDAR measurements has emerged as a powerful approach to enhance spatial understanding. This study introduces a novel, hardware-agnostic methodology that generates colourised point clouds from mechanical LiDAR using multiple camera inputs, providing complete 360-degree coverage. The primary innovation lies in its robustness under low-light conditions, achieved through the integration of a low-light image enhancement module within the fusion pipeline. The system requires initial calibration to determine intrinsic camera parameters, followed by automatic computation of the geometric transformation between the LiDAR and cameras, removing the need for specialised calibration targets and streamlining the setup. The data processing framework uses colour correction to ensure uniformity across camera feeds before fusion. The algorithm was tested using a Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR and a four-camera configuration. The optimised software achieved real-time performance and reliable colourisation even under very low illumination, successfully recovering scene details that would otherwise remain undetectable.

Title: Bibliometric-enhanced Systematic Literature Review of EEG in Education: Learning Concepts, Computational Methods, and Research Opportunities
Authors: Adi Wijaya, Said Hasibuan, Wiga Maulana Baihaqi, Rizki Darmawan, Rifkie Primartha, Catur Supriyanto
Abstract: Application of electroencephalography (EEG) in educational research has grown substantially, yet a comprehensive integration of methodological frameworks, educational constructs, computational methods, and research gaps remains limited. This study applies a Bibliometric-enhanced Systematic Literature Review (BenSLR) to provide a systematic overview of EEG in education. Literature was extracted from Scopus, screened, and analyzed, with keyword co-occurrence evaluated using VOSviewer and emerging trends visualized through an Enhanced Strategic Diagram via BiblioPlot. Key findings include engagement, attention, and learning style as prominent constructs, with machine learning and deep learning frequently employed for modeling complex cognitive states. EEG signal processing, feature extraction, and assessment of cognitive and affective states were recurrent across studies. Innovative interventions such as virtual reality and neurofeedback demonstrate EEG's role in supporting adaptive and individualized learning experiences. Challenges remain in linking neural markers with observable learning behaviors, extending measurements beyond attention and working memory, and enhancing predictive model generalizability. The study demonstrates BenSLR's potential to integrate qualitative and quantitative perspectives and offers a transferable approach for other research areas to develop methodologies and evidence-based educational interventions.

Title: Machine Learning Detection of Lithium Plating in Lithium-ion Cells: A Gaussian Process Approach
Authors: Ayush Patnaik, Adam B Zufall, Stephen K Robinson, Xinfan Lin
Abstract: Lithium plating during fast charging is a critical degradation mechanism that accelerates capacity fade and can trigger catastrophic safety failures. Recent work has identified a distinctive dQ/dV peak above 4.0 V as a reliable signature of plating onset; however, conventional methods for computing dQ/dV rely on finite differencing with filtering, which amplifies sensor noise and introduces bias in peak location. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Process (GP) framework for lithium plating detection by directly modeling the charge-voltage relationship Q(V) as a stochastic process with calibrated uncertainty. Leveraging the property that derivatives of GPs remain GPs, we infer dQ/dV analytically and probabilistically from the posterior, enabling robust detection without ad hoc smoothing. The framework provides three key benefits: (i) noise-aware inference with hyperparameters learned from data, (ii) closed-form derivatives with credible intervals for uncertainty quantification, and (iii) scalability to online variants suitable for embedded BMS. Experimental validation on Li-ion coin cells across a range of C-rates (0.2C-1C) and temperatures (0-40°C) demonstrates that the GP-based method reliably detects plating peaks under low-temperature, high-rate charging, while correctly reporting no peaks in baseline cases. The concurrence of GP-identified differential peaks, reduced charge throughput, and capacity fade measured via reference performance tests confirms the method's accuracy and robustness, establishing a practical pathway for real-time lithium plating detection.

Title: Robust NbN on Si-SiGe hybrid superconducting-semiconducting microwave quantum circuit
Authors: Paniz Foshat, Samane Kalhor, Shima Poorgholam-khanjari, Douglas Paul, Martin Weides, Kaveh Delfanazari
Abstract: Advancing large-scale quantum computing requires superconducting circuits that combine long coherence times with compatibility with semiconductor technology. We investigate niobium nitride (NbN) coplanar waveguide resonators integrated with Si/SiGe quantum wells, creating a hybrid platform designed for CMOS-compatible quantum hardware. Using temperature-dependent microwave spectroscopy in the single-photon regime, we examine resonance frequency and quality factor variations to probe the underlying loss mechanisms. Our analysis identifies the roles of two-level systems, quasiparticles, and scattering processes, and connects these losses to wafer properties and fabrication methods. The devices demonstrate reproducible performance and stable operation maintained for over two years, highlighting their robustness. These results provide design guidelines for developing low-loss, CMOS-compatible superconducting circuits and support progress toward resilient, scalable architectures for quantum information processing.

Title: Real-time Velocity Profile Optimization for Time-Optimal Maneuvering with Generic Acceleration Constraints
Authors: Mattia Piazza, Mattia Piccinini, Sebastiano Taddei, Francesco Biral, Enrico Bertolazzi
Abstract: The computation of time-optimal velocity profiles along prescribed paths, subject to generic acceleration constraints, is a crucial problem in robot trajectory planning, with particular relevance to autonomous racing. However, the existing methods either support arbitrary acceleration constraints at high computational cost or use conservative box constraints for computational efficiency. We propose FBGA, a new \underline{F}orward-\underline{B}ackward algorithm with \underline{G}eneric \underline{A}cceleration constraints, which achieves both high accuracy and low computation time. FBGA operates forward and backward passes to maximize the velocity profile in short, discretized path segments, while satisfying user-defined performance limits. Tested on five racetracks and two vehicle classes, FBGA handles complex, non-convex acceleration constraints with custom formulations. Its maneuvers and lap times closely match optimal control baselines (within $0.11\%$-$0.36\%$), while being up to three orders of magnitude faster. FBGA maintains high accuracy even with coarse discretization, making it well-suited for online multi-query trajectory planning. Our open-source \texttt{C++} implementation is available at: this https URL.

Title: Contrastive Diffusion Guidance for Spatial Inverse Problems
Authors: Sattwik Basu, Chaitanya Amballa, Zhongweiyang Xu, Jorge Vančo Sampedro, Srihari Nelakuditi, Romit Roy Choudhury
Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the spatial layout of a place, a home floorplan for example, from a user`s movements inside that layout. Direct inversion is ill-posed since many floorplans can explain the same movement trajectories. We adopt a diffusion-based posterior sampler to generate layouts consistent with the measurements. While active research is in progress on generative inverse solvers, we find that the forward operator in our problem poses new challenges. The path-planning process inside a floorplan is a non-invertible, non-differentiable function, and causes instability while optimizing using the likelihood score. We break-away from existing approaches and reformulate the likelihood score in a smoother embedding space. The embedding space is trained with a contrastive loss which brings compatible floorplans and trajectories close to each other, while pushing mismatched pairs far apart. We show that a surrogate form of the likelihood score in this embedding space is a valid approximation of the true likelihood score, making it possible to steer the denoising process towards the posterior. Across extensive experiments, our model CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans from trajectories, and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and guided-diffusion methods.

Title: Explainable and Resilient ML-Based Physical-Layer Attack Detectors
Authors: Aleksandra Knapińska, Marija Furdek
Abstract: Detection of emerging attacks on network infrastructure is a critical aspect of security management. To meet the growing scale and complexity of modern threats, machine learning (ML) techniques offer valuable tools for automating the detection of malicious activities. However, as these techniques become more complex, their internal operations grow increasingly opaque. In this context, we address the need for explainable physical-layer attack detection methods. First, we analyze the inner workings of various classifiers trained to alert about physical layer intrusions, examining how the influence of different monitored parameters varies depending on the type of attack being detected. This analysis not only improves the interpretability of the models but also suggests ways to enhance their design for increased speed. In the second part, we evaluate the detectors' resilience to malicious parameter noising. The results highlight a key trade-off between model speed and resilience. This work serves as a design guideline for developing fast and robust detectors trained on available network monitoring data.

Title: Stability Analysis of Thermohaline Convection With a Time-Varying Shear Flow Using the Lyapunov Method
Authors: Kalin Kochnev, Chang Liu
Abstract: This work identifies instabilities and computes the growth rate of a linear time-varying system using the Lyapunov method. The linear system describes cold fresh water on top of hot salty water with a periodically time-varying background shear flow. We employ a time-dependent weighting matrix to construct a Lyapunov function candidate, and the resulting linear matrix inequalities formulation is discretized in time using the forward Euler method. As the number of temporal discretization points increases, the growth rate predicted from the Lyapunov method or the Floquet theory will converge to the same value as that obtained from numerical simulations. We also use the Lyapunov method to analyze the instantaneous principal direction of instabilities and compare the computational resources required by the Lyapunov method, numerical simulations, and the Floquet theory.

Title: OmniRetarget: Interaction-Preserving Data Generation for Humanoid Whole-Body Loco-Manipulation and Scene Interaction
Authors: Lujie Yang, Xiaoyu Huang, Zhen Wu, Angjoo Kanazawa, Pieter Abbeel, Carmelo Sferrazza, C. Karen Liu, Rocky Duan, Guanya Shi
Abstract: A dominant paradigm for teaching humanoid robots complex skills is to retarget human motions as kinematic references to train reinforcement learning (RL) policies. However, existing retargeting pipelines often struggle with the significant embodiment gap between humans and robots, producing physically implausible artifacts like foot-skating and penetration. More importantly, common retargeting methods neglect the rich human-object and human-environment interactions essential for expressive locomotion and loco-manipulation. To address this, we introduce OmniRetarget, an interaction-preserving data generation engine based on an interaction mesh that explicitly models and preserves the crucial spatial and contact relationships between an agent, the terrain, and manipulated objects. By minimizing the Laplacian deformation between the human and robot meshes while enforcing kinematic constraints, OmniRetarget generates kinematically feasible trajectories. Moreover, preserving task-relevant interactions enables efficient data augmentation, from a single demonstration to different robot embodiments, terrains, and object configurations. We comprehensively evaluate OmniRetarget by retargeting motions from OMOMO, LAFAN1, and our in-house MoCap datasets, generating over 8-hour trajectories that achieve better kinematic constraint satisfaction and contact preservation than widely used baselines. Such high-quality data enables proprioceptive RL policies to successfully execute long-horizon (up to 30 seconds) parkour and loco-manipulation skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid, trained with only 5 reward terms and simple domain randomization shared by all tasks, without any learning curriculum.

Title: Scaling Spoken Language Models with Syllabic Speech Tokenization
Authors: Nicholas Lee, Cheol Jun Cho, Alan W Black, Gopala K. Anumanchipalli
Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) typically discretize speech into high-frame-rate tokens extracted from SSL speech models. As the most successful LMs are based on the Transformer architecture, processing these long token streams with self-attention is expensive, as attention scales quadratically with sequence length. A recent SSL work introduces acoustic tokenization of speech at the syllable level, which is more interpretable and potentially more scalable with significant compression in token lengths (4-5 Hz). Yet, their value for spoken language modeling is not yet fully explored. We present the first systematic study of syllabic tokenization for spoken language modeling, evaluating models on a suite of SLU benchmarks while varying training data scale. Syllabic tokens can match or surpass the previous high-frame rate tokens while significantly cutting training and inference costs, achieving more than a 2x reduction in training time and a 5x reduction in FLOPs. Our findings highlight syllable-level language modeling as a promising path to efficient long-context spoken language models.

Title: A Decentralized Pilot Assignment Algorithm for Scalable O-RAN Cell-Free Massive MIMO
Authors: Myeung Suk Oh, Anindya Bijoy Das, Seyyedali Hosseinalipour, Taejoon Kim, David J. Love, Christopher G. Brinton
Abstract: Radio access networks (RANs) in monolithic architectures have limited adaptability to supporting different network scenarios. Recently, open-RAN (O-RAN) techniques have begun adding enormous flexibility to RAN implementations. O-RAN is a natural architectural fit for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) systems, where many geographically-distributed access points (APs) are employed to achieve ubiquitous coverage and enhanced user performance. In this paper, we address the decentralized pilot assignment (PA) problem for scalable O-RAN-based CFmMIMO systems. We propose a low-complexity PA scheme using a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MA-DRL) framework in which multiple learning agents perform distributed learning over the O-RAN communication architecture to suppress pilot contamination. Our approach does not require prior channel knowledge but instead relies on real-time interactions made with the environment during the learning procedure. In addition, we design a codebook search (CS) scheme that exploits the decentralization of our O-RAN CFmMIMO architecture, where different codebook sets can be utilized to further improve PA performance without any significant additional complexities. Numerical evaluations verify that our proposed scheme provides substantial computational scalability advantages and improvements in channel estimation performance compared to the state-of-the-art.

Title: Dynamic and Robust Sensor Selection Strategies for Wireless Positioning with TOA/RSS Measurement
Authors: Myeung Suk Oh, Seyyedali Hosseinalipour, Taejoon Kim, David J. Love, James V. Krogmeier, Christopher G. Brinton
Abstract: Emerging wireless applications are requiring ever more accurate location-positioning from sensor measurements. In this paper, we develop sensor selection strategies for 3D wireless positioning based on time of arrival (TOA) and received signal strength (RSS) measurements to handle two distinct scenarios: (i) known approximated target location, for which we conduct dynamic sensor selection to minimize the positioning error; and (ii) unknown approximated target location, in which the worst-case positioning error is minimized via robust sensor selection. We derive expressions for the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) as a performance metric to quantify the positioning accuracy resulted from selected sensors. For dynamic sensor selection, two greedy selection strategies are proposed, each of which exploits properties revealed in the derived CRLB expressions. These selection strategies are shown to strike an efficient balance between computational complexity and performance suboptimality. For robust sensor selection, we show that the conventional convex relaxation approach leads to instability, and then develop three algorithms based on (i) iterative convex optimization (ICO), (ii) difference of convex functions programming (DCP), and (iii) discrete monotonic optimization (DMO). Each of these strategies exhibits a different tradeoff between computational complexity and optimality guarantee. Simulation results show that the proposed sensor selection strategies provide significant improvements in terms of accuracy and/or complexity compared to existing sensor selection methods.

Title: Minimum Description Feature Selection for Complexity Reduction in Machine Learning-based Wireless Positioning
Authors: Myeung Suk Oh, Anindya Bijoy Das, Taejoon Kim, David J. Love, Christopher G. Brinton
Abstract: Recently, deep learning approaches have provided solutions to difficult problems in wireless positioning (WP). Although these WP algorithms have attained excellent and consistent performance against complex channel environments, the computational complexity coming from processing high-dimensional features can be prohibitive for mobile applications. In this work, we design a novel positioning neural network (P-NN) that utilizes the minimum description features to substantially reduce the complexity of deep learning-based WP. P-NN's feature selection strategy is based on maximum power measurements and their temporal locations to convey information needed to conduct WP. We improve P-NN's learning ability by intelligently processing two different types of inputs: sparse image and measurement matrices. Specifically, we implement a self-attention layer to reinforce the training ability of our network. We also develop a technique to adapt feature space size, optimizing over the expected information gain and the classification capability quantified with information-theoretic measures on signal bin selection. Numerical results show that P-NN achieves a significant advantage in performance-complexity tradeoff over deep learning baselines that leverage the full power delay profile (PDP). In particular, we find that P-NN achieves a large improvement in performance for low SNR, as unnecessary measurements are discarded in our minimum description features.

Title: On Fixed-Time Stability for a Class of Singularly Perturbed Systems using Composite Lyapunov Functions
Authors: Michael Tang, Miroslav Krstic, Jorge Poveda
Abstract: Fixed-time stable dynamical systems are capable of achieving exact convergence to an equilibrium point within a fixed time that is independent of the initial conditions of the system. This property makes them highly appealing for designing control, estimation, and optimization algorithms in applications with stringent performance requirements. However, the set of tools available for analyzing the interconnection of fixed-time stable systems is rather limited compared to their asymptotic counterparts. In this paper, we address some of these limitations by exploiting the emergence of multiple time scales in nonlinear singularly perturbed dynamical systems, where the fast dynamics and the slow dynamics are fixed-time stable on their own. By extending the so-called composite Lyapunov method from asymptotic stability to the context of fixed-time stability, we provide a novel class of Lyapunov-based sufficient conditions to certify fixed-time stability in a class of singularly perturbed dynamical systems. The results are illustrated, analytically and numerically, using a fixed-time gradient flow system interconnected with a fixed-time plant and an additional high-order example.

Title: Brain Tumor Classification on MRI in Light of Molecular Markers
Authors: Jun Liu, Geng Yuan, Weihao Zeng, Hao Tang, Wenbin Zhang, Xue Lin, XiaoLin Xu, Dong Huang, Yanzhi Wang
Abstract: In research findings, co-deletion of the 1p/19q gene is associated with clinical outcomes in low-grade gliomas. The ability to predict 1p19q status is critical for treatment planning and patient follow-up. This study aims to utilize a specially MRI-based convolutional neural network for brain cancer detection. Although public networks such as RestNet and AlexNet can effectively diagnose brain cancers using transfer learning, the model includes quite a few weights that have nothing to do with medical images. As a result, the diagnostic results are unreliable by the transfer learning model. To deal with the problem of trustworthiness, we create the model from the ground up, rather than depending on a pre-trained model. To enable flexibility, we combined convolution stacking with a dropout and full connect operation, it improved performance by reducing overfitting. During model training, we also supplement the given dataset and inject Gaussian noise. We use three--fold cross-validation to train the best selection model. Comparing InceptionV3, VGG16, and MobileNetV2 fine-tuned with pre-trained models, our model produces better results. On an validation set of 125 codeletion vs. 31 not codeletion images, the proposed network achieves 96.37\% percent F1-score, 97.46\% percent precision, and 96.34\% percent recall when classifying 1p/19q codeletion and not codeletion images.

Title: LISAC: Learned Coded Waveform Design for ISAC with OFDM
Authors: Chenghong Bian, Yumeng Zhang, Meng Hua, Kaitao Meng, Deniz Gunduz
Abstract: We propose deep learning based coded waveform design for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). Our goal is to design a coded waveform capable of delivering accurate target parameter estimation while maintaining high communication quality measured in terms of bit error rate (BER). In the proposed learned coded waveform for ISAC (LISAC), the pilot and data encoding functions at the encoder are parameterized by recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and are trained jointly in an end-to-end fashion. The communication receiver estimates the channel and performs residual-assisted minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel equalization, where a neural network is introduced to calibrate the coarse estimate produced by the standard MMSE channel equalizer. Then, an RNN-based channel decoder is employed to decode the information bits using the equalized signal. Two different sensing loss functions are considered, one calculates the mean square error (MSE) between the original and the estimated sensing parameters, while the other calculates the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). The LISAC modules are optimized using a weighted combination of communication and sensing losses and different trade-off points between the sensing and communication performances are achieved by adjusting the weights. Simulation results show that the proposed LISAC waveform achieves a better trade-off curve compared to existing alternatives for both AWGN and multi-path fading scenarios. Ablation studies are carried out to demonstrate the gain brought by each design component for a better understanding of the proposed scheme.

Title: Neural Operator Feedback for a First-Order PIDE with Spatially-Varying State Delay
Authors: Jie Qi, Jiaqi Hu, Jing Zhang, Miroslav Krstic
Abstract: A transport PDE with a spatial integral and recirculation with constant delay has been a benchmark for neural operator approximations of PDE backstepping controllers. Introducing a spatially-varying delay into the model gives rise to a gain operator defined through integral equations which the operator's input -- the varying delay function -- enters in previously unencountered manners, including in the limits of integration and as the inverse of the `delayED time' function. This, in turn, introduces novel mathematical challenges in estimating the operator's Lipschitz constant. The backstepping kernel function having two branches endows the feedback law with a two-branch structure, where only one of the two feedback branches depends on both of the kernel branches. For this rich feedback structure, we propose a neural operator approximation of such a two-branch feedback law and prove the approximator to be semiglobally practically stabilizing. With numerical results we illustrate the training of the neural operator and its stabilizing capability.

Title: tCURLoRA: Tensor CUR Decomposition Based Low-Rank Parameter Adaptation and Its Application in Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Guanghua He, Wangang Cheng, Hancan Zhu, Xiaohao Cai, Gaohang Yu
Abstract: Transfer learning, by leveraging knowledge from pre-trained models, has significantly enhanced the performance of target tasks. However, as deep neural networks scale up, full fine-tuning introduces substantial computational and storage challenges in resource-constrained environments, limiting its widespread adoption. To address this, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have been developed to reduce computational complexity and storage requirements by minimizing the number of updated parameters. While matrix decomposition-based PEFT methods, such as LoRA, show promise, they struggle to fully capture the high-dimensional structural characteristics of model weights. In contrast, high-dimensional tensors offer a more natural representation of neural network weights, allowing for a more comprehensive capture of higher-order features and multi-dimensional interactions. In this paper, we propose tCURLoRA, a novel fine-tuning method based on tensor CUR decomposition. By concatenating pre-trained weight matrices into a three-dimensional tensor and applying tensor CUR decomposition, we update only the lower-order tensor components during fine-tuning, effectively reducing computational and storage overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that tCURLoRA outperforms existing PEFT methods in medical image segmentation tasks.

Title: From Voice to Safety: Language AI Powered Pilot-ATC Communication Understanding for Airport Surface Movement Collision Risk Assessment
Authors: Yutian Pang, Andrew Paul Kendall, Alex Porcayo, Mariah Barsotti, Anahita Jain, John-Paul Clarke
Abstract: This work provides a feasible solution to the existing airport surface safety monitoring capabilities (i.e., Airport Surface Surveillance Capability (ASSC)), namely language AI-based voice communication understanding for collision risk assessment. The proposed framework consists of two major parts, (a) rule-enhanced Named Entity Recognition (NER); (b) surface collision risk modeling. NER module generates information tables by processing voice communication transcripts, which serve as references for producing potential taxi plans and calculating the surface movement collision risk. We first collect and annotate our dataset based on open-sourced video recordings and safety investigation reports. Additionally, we refer to FAA Order JO 7110.65W and FAA Order JO 7340.2N to get the list of heuristic rules and phase contractions of communication between the pilot and the Air Traffic Controller (ATCo). Then, we propose the novel ATC Rule-Enhanced NER method, which integrates the heuristic rules into the model training and inference stages, resulting in a hybrid rule-based NER model. We show the effectiveness of this hybrid approach by comparing different setups with different token-level embedding models. For the risk modeling, we adopt the node-link airport layout graph from NASA FACET and model the aircraft taxi speed at each link as a log-normal distribution and derive the total taxi time distribution. Then, we propose a spatiotemporal formulation of the risk probability of two aircraft moving across potential collision nodes during ground movement. Furthermore, we propose the real-time implementation of such a method to obtain the lead time, with a comparison with a Petri-Net based method.

Title: Data-Driven Estimation of Structured Singular Values
Authors: Margarita A. Guerrero, Braghadeesh Lakshminarayanan, Cristian R. Rojas
Abstract: Estimating the size of the modeling error is crucial for robust control. Over the years, numerous metrics have been developed to quantify the model error in a control relevant manner. One of the most important such metrics is the structured singular value, as it leads to necessary and sufficient conditions for ensuring stability and robustness in feedback control under structured model uncertainty. Although the computation of the structured singular value is often intractable, lower and upper bounds for it can often be obtained if a model of the system is known. In this paper, we introduce a fully data-driven method to estimate a lower bound for the structured singular value, by conducting experiments on the system and applying power iterations to the collected data. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that this method effectively lower bounds the structured singular value, yielding results comparable to the MATLAB$^©$ Robust Control Toolbox.

Title: A Hybrid Systems Model of Feedback Optimization for Linear Systems: Convergence and Robustness
Authors: Oscar Jed Chuy, Matthew Hale, Ricardo Sanfelice
Abstract: Feedback optimization algorithms compute inputs to a system using real-time output measurements, which helps mitigate the effects of disturbances. However, existing work often models both system dynamics and computations in either discrete or continuous time, which may not accurately model some applications. In this work, we model linear system dynamics in continuous time, and we model the computations of inputs in discrete time. Therefore, we present a novel hybrid systems model of feedback optimization. We first establish the well-posedness of this hybrid model and establish completeness of solutions while ruling out Zeno behavior. Then we show the state of the system converges exponentially fast to a ball of known radius about a desired goal state. Next we analytically show that this system is robust to perturbations in (i) the values of measured outputs, (ii) the matrices that model the linear time-invariant system, and (iii) the times at which inputs are applied to the system. Simulation results confirm that this approach successfully mitigates the effects of disturbances.

Title: GOUHFI: a novel contrast- and resolution-agnostic segmentation tool for Ultra-High Field MRI
Authors: Marc-Antoine Fortin, Anne Louise Kristoffersen, Michael Staff Larsen, Laurent Lamalle, Ruediger Stirnberg, Paal Erik Goa
Abstract: Recently, Ultra-High Field MRI (UHF-MRI) has become more available and one of the best tools to study the brain. One common step in quantitative neuroimaging is to segment the brain into several regions, which has been done using software packages like FreeSurfer , FastSurferVINN or SynthSeg. However, the differences between UHF-MRI and 1.5T or 3T images are such that the automatic segmentation techniques optimized at these field strengths usually produce unsatisfactory segmentation results for UHF images. Thus, it has been particularly challenging to perform region-based quantitative analyses as typically done with 1.5-3T data, underscoring the crucial need for developing new automatic segmentation techniques designed to handle UHF images. Hence, we propose a novel Deep Learning (DL)-based segmentation technique called GOUHFI: Generalized and Optimized segmentation tool for Ultra-High Field Images, designed to segment UHF images of various contrasts and resolutions. For training, we used a total of 206 label maps from datasets acquired at 3T, 7T and 9.4T. In contrast to most DL strategies, we used a domain randomization approach, where synthetic images were used to train a 3D U-Net. GOUHFI was tested on seven different datasets and compared to existing techniques like FastSurferVINN,SynthSeg and CEREBRUM-7T. GOUHFI was able to segment the six contrasts and seven resolutions tested at 3T, 7T and 9.4T. Average Dice scores of 0.90, 0.90 and 0.93 were computed against the ground truth segmentations at 3T, 7T and 9.4T, respectively. Ultimately, GOUHFI is a promising new segmentation tool, being the first of its kind proposing a contrast- and resolution-agnostic alternative for UHF-MRI without requiring fine-tuning or retraining, making it the forthcoming alternative for neuroscientists working with UHF-MRI or even lower field strengths.

Title: Massive MIMO with 1-Bit DACs: Data Detection for Quantized Linear Precoding with Dithering
Authors: Amin Radbord, Italo Atzeni, Antti Tölli
Abstract: To leverage high-frequency bands in 6G wireless systems and beyond, employing massive multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) arrays at the transmitter and/or receiver side is crucial. To mitigate the power consumption and hardware complexity across massive frequency bands and antenna arrays, a sacrifice in the resolution of the data converters will be inevitable. In this paper, we consider a point-to-point massive MIMO system with 1-bit digital-to-analog converters at the transmitter, where the linearly precoded signal is supplemented with dithering before the 1-bit quantization. For this system, we propose a new maximumlikelihood (ML) data detection method at the receiver by deriving the mean and covariance matrix of the received signal, where symbol-dependent linear minimum mean squared error estimation is utilized to efficiently linearize the transmitted signal. Numerical results show that the proposed ML method can provide gains of more than two orders of magnitude in terms of symbol error rate over conventional data detection based on soft estimation.

Title: Regularizing Learnable Feature Extraction for Automatic Speech Recognition
Authors: Peter Vieting, Maximilian Kannen, Benedikt Hilmes, Ralf Schlüter, Hermann Ney
Abstract: Neural front-ends are an appealing alternative to traditional, fixed feature extraction pipelines for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems since they can be directly trained to fit the acoustic model. However, their performance often falls short compared to classical methods, which we show is largely due to their increased susceptibility to overfitting. This work therefore investigates regularization methods for training ASR models with learnable feature extraction front-ends. First, we examine audio perturbation methods and show that larger relative improvements can be obtained for learnable features. Additionally, we identify two limitations in the standard use of SpecAugment for these front-ends and propose masking in the short time Fourier transform (STFT)-domain as a simple but effective modification to address these challenges. Finally, integrating both regularization approaches effectively closes the performance gap between traditional and learnable features.

Title: DNN-Based Precoding in RIS-Aided mmWave MIMO Systems With Practical Phase Shift
Authors: Po-Heng Chou, Ching-Wen Chen, Wan-Jen Huang, Walid Saad, Yu Tsao, Ronald Y. Chang
Abstract: In this paper, the precoding design is investigated for maximizing the throughput of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with obstructed direct communication paths. In particular, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO transmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight (LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal codewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and time-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier transform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating amplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the discrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant computation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network (DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection. Simulation results show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase. These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems.

Title: Musical Source Separation Bake-Off: Comparing Objective Metrics with Human Perception
Authors: Noah Jaffe, John Ashley Burgoyne
Abstract: Music source separation aims to extract individual sound sources (e.g., vocals, drums, guitar) from a mixed music recording. However, evaluating the quality of separated audio remains challenging, as commonly used metrics like the source-to-distortion ratio (SDR) do not always align with human perception. In this study, we conducted a large-scale listener evaluation on the MUSDB18 test set, collecting approximately 30 ratings per track from seven distinct listener groups. We compared several objective energy-ratio metrics, including legacy measures (BSSEval v4, SI-SDR variants), and embedding-based alternatives (Frechet Audio Distance using CLAP-LAION-music, EnCodec, VGGish, Wave2Vec2, and HuBERT). While SDR remains the best-performing metric for vocal estimates, our results show that the scale-invariant signal-to-artifacts ratio (SI-SAR) better predicts listener ratings for drums and bass stems. Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) computed with the CLAP-LAION-music embedding also performs competitively--achieving Kendall's tau values of 0.25 for drums and 0.19 for bass--matching or surpassing energy-based metrics for those stems. However, none of the embedding-based metrics, including CLAP, correlate positively with human perception for vocal estimates. These findings highlight the need for stem-specific evaluation strategies and suggest that no single metric reliably reflects perceptual quality across all source types. We release our raw listener ratings to support reproducibility and further research.

Title: Credible Uncertainty Quantification under Noise and System Model Mismatch
Authors: Penggao Yan, Li-Ta Hsu
Abstract: State estimators often provide self-assessed uncertainty metrics, such as covariance matrices, whose credibility is critical for downstream tasks. However, these self-assessments can be misleading due to underlying modeling violations like noise model mismatch (NMM) or system model misspecification (SMM). This letter addresses this problem by developing a unified, multi-metric framework that integrates noncredibility index (NCI), negative log-likelihood (NLL), and energy score (ES) metrics, featuring an empirical location test (ELT) to detect system model bias and a directional probing technique that uses the metrics' asymmetric sensitivities to distinguish NMM from SMM. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the proposed method achieves excellent diagnosis accuracy (80-100%) and significantly outperforms single-metric diagnosis methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method is further validated on a real-world UWB positioning dataset. This framework provides a practical tool for turning patterns of credibility indicators into actionable diagnoses of model deficiencies.

Title: Edge Server Monitoring for Job Assignment
Authors: Samuel Chamoun, Sirin Chakraborty, Eric Graves, Kevin Chan, Yin Sun
Abstract: In this paper, we study a goal-oriented communication problem for edge server monitoring, where compute jobs arrive intermittently at dispatchers and must be immediately assigned to distributed edge servers. Due to competing workloads and the dynamic nature of the edge environment, server availability fluctuates over time. To maintain accurate estimates of server availability states, each dispatcher updates its belief using two mechanisms: (i) active queries over shared communication channels and (ii) feedback from past job executions. We formulate a query scheduling problem that maximizes the job success rate under limited communication resources for queries. This problem is modeled as a Restless Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) with multiple actions and addressed using a Net-Gain Maximization (NGM) scheduling algorithm, which selects servers to query based on their expected improvement in execution performance. Simulation results show that the proposed NGM Policy significantly outperforms baseline strategies, achieving up to a 30% gain over the Round-Robin Policy and up to a 107% gain over the Never-Query Policy.

Title: Trajectory Encryption Cooperative Salvo Guidance
Authors: Lohitvel Gopikannan, Shashi Ranjan Kumar, Abhinav Sinha
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of trajectory encryption in cooperative simultaneous target interception, wherein heterogeneity in guidance principles across a team of unmanned autonomous systems is leveraged as a strategic design feature. By employing a mix of heterogeneous time-to-go formulations leading to a cooperative guidance strategy, the swarm of vehicles is able to generate diverse trajectory families. This diversity expands the feasible solution space for simultaneous target interception, enhances robustness under disturbances, and enables flexible time-to-go adjustments without predictable detouring. From an adversarial perspective, heterogeneity obscures the collective interception intent by preventing straightforward prediction of swarm dynamics, effectively acting as an encryption layer in the trajectory domain. Simulations demonstrate that the swarm of heterogeneous vehicles is able to intercept a moving target simultaneously from a diverse set of initial engagement configurations.

Title: MAPPO for Edge Server Monitoring
Authors: Samuel Chamoun, Christian McDowell, Robin Buchanan, Kevin Chan, Eric Graves, Yin Sun
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a goal-oriented communication problem for edge server monitoring, where jobs arrive intermittently at multiple dispatchers and must be assigned to shared edge servers with finite queues and time-varying availability. Accurate knowledge of server status is critical for sustaining high throughput, yet remains challenging under dynamic workloads and partial observability. To address this challenge, each dispatcher maintains server knowledge through two complementary mechanisms: (i) active status queries that provide instantaneous updates at a communication cost, and (ii) job execution feedback that reveals server conditions upon successful or failed job completion. We formulate a cooperative multi-agent distributed decision-making problem in which dispatchers jointly optimize query scheduling to balance throughput against communication overhead. To solve this problem, we propose a Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO)-based algorithm that leverages centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) to learn distributed query-and-dispatch policies under partial and stale observations. Experiments show that MAPPO achieves superior throughput-cost tradeoffs and significantly outperforms baseline strategies across varying query costs, job arrival rates, and dispatchers.

Title: Enabling Drone Detection with SWARM Repeater-Assisted MIMO ISAC
Authors: Palatip Jopanya, Diana P. M. Osorio
Abstract: As definitions about new architectural aspects, use cases, and standards for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) continue to appear, cellular systems based on massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna technology are also experiencing a parallel evolution through the integration of novel network components. This evolution should support emerging ISAC use cases and services. In particular, this paper explores a recent vision for cost-efficient cellular network densification through the deployment of swarms of repeaters. Leveraging their ability to retransmit signals instantaneously, we investigate how these repeaters can enhance radar sensing capabilities for drone detection in a swarm repeater-assisted MIMO ISAC system. Our results demonstrate that, by optimizing the gains of repeaters given a sufficient maximum amplification gain, increasing the number of repeaters can lead to gains in sensing performance.

Title: Reciprocal Beyond-Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (BD-RIS): Scattering Matrix Design via Manifold Optimization
Authors: Marko Fidanovski, Iván Alexander Morales Sandoval, Hyeon Seok Rou, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, Emil Björnson
Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RISs) are emerging as a transformative technology in wireless communications, enabling enhanced performance and quality of service (QoS) of wireless systems in harsh urban environments due to their relatively low cost and advanced signal processing capabilities. Generally, BD-RIS systems are employed to improve robustness, increase achievable rates, and enhance energy efficiency of wireless systems in both direct and indirect ways. The direct way is to produce a favorable propagation environment via the design of optimized scattering matrices, while the indirect way is to reap additional improvements via the design of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) beamformers that further exploit the latter "engineered" medium. In this article, the problem of sum-rate maximization via BD-RIS is examined, with a focus on feasibility, namely low-complexity physical implementation, by enforcing reciprocity in the BD-RIS design. We begin by outlining the system model and formulating an optimization problem that aims to enhance the system's sum-rate by designing a symmetric scattering matrix. In particular, the approach leverages a manifold optimization framework, where a penalty term is added to the objective function to ensure that the symmetry constraint is upheld, with reciprocity further enforced by projecting the obtained solution onto a set of feasible scattering matrices. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in outperforming current state-of-the-art (SotA) approaches in terms of sum-rate maximization.

Title: Parasitic actuation delay limits the minimum employable time headway in connected and autonomous vehicles
Authors: Guoqi Ma, Prabhakar R. Pagilla, Swaroop Darbha
Abstract: Adaptive andcooperative adaptive cruise control (ACC and CACC) and next generation CACC (CACC+) systems usually employ a constant time headway policy (CTHP) for platooning of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). In ACC, the ego vehicle uses onboard sensors to measure the position and velocity of the predecessor vehicle to maintain a desired spacing. The CACC and CACC+systems use additional information, such as acceleration(s) communicated through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication of the predecessor vehicle(s); these systems have been shown to result in improved spacing performance, throughput, and safety over ACC. Parasitic dynamics are generally difficult to model and the parasitic parameters (delay, lag, etc.) are difficult to obtain. Parasitic actuation delays can have deleterious effects and impose limits on the mobility and safety of CAVs. It is reasonable to assume that the bounds on parasitic actuation delays are known a priori. For CAVs, we need to address both internal stability and string stability in the presence of parasitic actuation delays. This requires robustness of string and internal stability for all values of parasitic actuation delays that are within the specified upper bound. In this paper, we provide the minimum employable time headway for ACC, CACC, and CACC+ (`r' predecessors look-ahead), respectively. The inclusion of the internal stability in the string stability condition is analyzed based on Pontryagin's interlacing theorem for time delay systems. We provide comparative numerical results to corroborate the achieved theoretical results.

Title: Hierarchical Analysis and Control of Epidemic Spreading over Networks using Dissipativity and Mesh Stability
Authors: Shirantha Welikala, Hai Lin, Panos J. Antsaklis
Abstract: Analyzing and controlling spreading processes are challenging problems due to the involved non-linear node (subsystem) dynamics, unknown disturbances, complex interconnections, and the large-scale and multi-level nature of the problems. The dissipativity concept provides a practical framework for addressing such concerns, thanks to the energy-based representation it offers for subsystems and the compositional properties it provides for the analysis and control of interconnected (networked) systems comprised of such subsystems. Therefore, in this paper, we utilize the dissipativity concept to analyze and control a spreading process that occurs over a hierarchy of nodes, groups, and a network (i.e., a spreading network). We start by generalizing several existing results on dissipativity-based topology design for networked systems. Next, we model the considered spreading network as a networked system and establish the dissipativity properties of its nodes. The generalized topology design method is then applied at multiple levels of the considered spreading network to formulate its analysis and control problems as Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problems. We identify and enforce localized necessary conditions to support the feasibility of the LMI problem solved at each subsequent hierarchical level of the spreading network. Consequently, the proposed method does not involve iterative multi-level optimization stages that are computationally inefficient. The proposed control solution ensures that the spreading network is not only stable but also dissipative and mesh-stable. Compared to conventional methods, such as threshold pruning and high-degree edge removal, our approach offers superior performance in terms of infection containment, control efficiency, and disturbance robustness. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

Title: VSSFlow: Unifying Video-conditioned Sound and Speech Generation via Joint Learning
Authors: Xin Cheng, Yuyue Wang, Xihua Wang, Yihan Wu, Kaisi Guan, Yijing Chen, Peng Zhang, Xiaojiang Liu, Meng Cao, Ruihua Song
Abstract: Video-conditioned sound and speech generation, encompassing video-to-sound (V2S) and visual text-to-speech (VisualTTS) tasks, are conventionally addressed as separate tasks, with limited exploration to unify them within a signle framework. Recent attempts to unify V2S and VisualTTS face challenges in handling distinct condition types (e.g., heterogeneous video and transcript conditions) and require complex training stages. Unifying these two tasks remains an open problem. To bridge this gap, we present VSSFlow, which seamlessly integrates both V2S and VisualTTS tasks into a unified flow-matching framework. VSSFlow uses a novel condition aggregation mechanism to handle distinct input signals. We find that cross-attention and self-attention layer exhibit different inductive biases in the process of introducing condition. Therefore, VSSFlow leverages these inductive biases to effectively handle different representations: cross-attention for ambiguous video conditions and self-attention for more deterministic speech transcripts. Furthermore, contrary to the prevailing belief that joint training on the two tasks requires complex training strategies and may degrade performance, we find that VSSFlow benefits from the end-to-end joint learning process for sound and speech generation without extra designs on training stages. Detailed analysis attributes it to the learned general audio prior shared between tasks, which accelerates convergence, enhances conditional generation, and stabilizes the classifier-free guidance process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VSSFlow surpasses the state-of-the-art domain-specific baselines on both V2S and VisualTTS benchmarks, underscoring the critical potential of unified generative models.

Title: Event-Driven Control via Sparsity-Promoting Regularization: A Rollout Approach with Performance Guarantees
Authors: Shumpei Nishida, Kunihisa Okano
Abstract: This paper presents a controller design framework aiming to balance control performance and actuation rate. Control performance is evaluated by an infinite-horizon average cost, and the number of control actions is penalized via sparsity-promoting regularization. Since the formulated optimal control problem has a combinatorial nature, we employ a rollout algorithm to obtain a tractable suboptimal solution. In the proposed scheme, actuation timings are determined through a multistage minimization procedure based on a receding-horizon approach, and the corresponding control inputs are computed online. We establish theoretical performance guarantees with respect to periodic control and prove the stability of the closed-loop system. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a numerical example.

Title: RobustNeuralNetworks.jl: a Package for Machine Learning and Data-Driven Control with Certified Robustness
Authors: Nicholas H. Barbara, Max Revay, Ruigang Wang, Jing Cheng, Ian R. Manchester
Abstract: Neural networks are typically sensitive to small input perturbations, leading to unexpected or brittle behaviour. We present this http URL: a Julia package for neural network models that are constructed to naturally satisfy a set of user-defined robustness metrics. The package is based on the recently proposed Recurrent Equilibrium Network (REN) and Lipschitz-Bounded Deep Network (LBDN) model classes, and is designed to interface directly with Julia's most widely-used machine learning package, this http URL. We discuss the theory behind our model parameterization, give an overview of the package, and provide a tutorial demonstrating its use in image classification, reinforcement learning, and nonlinear state-observer design.

Title: Complexity Reduction in Machine Learning-Based Wireless Positioning: Minimum Description Features
Authors: Myeung Suk Oh, Anindya Bijoy Das, Taejoon Kim, David J. Love, Christopher G. Brinton
Abstract: A recent line of research has been investigating deep learning approaches to wireless positioning (WP). Although these WP algorithms have demonstrated high accuracy and robust performance against diverse channel conditions, they also have a major drawback: they require processing high-dimensional features, which can be prohibitive for mobile applications. In this work, we design a positioning neural network (P-NN) that substantially reduces the complexity of deep learning-based WP through carefully crafted minimum description features. Our feature selection is based on maximum power measurements and their temporal locations to convey information needed to conduct WP. We also develop a novel methodology for adaptively selecting the size of feature space, which optimizes over balancing the expected amount of useful information and classification capability, quantified using information-theoretic measures on the signal bin selection. Numerical results show that P-NN achieves a significant advantage in performance-complexity tradeoff over deep learning baselines that leverage the full power delay profile (PDP).

Title: Optimal transmission expansion modestly reduces decarbonization costs of U.S. electricity
Authors: Rangrang Zheng, Greg Schivley, Matthias Fripp, Michael J. Roberts
Abstract: Expanding interregional transmission is widely viewed as essential for integrating clean energy into decarbonized power systems. Using the open-source Switch capacity expansion model with detailed representation of existing U.S. generation and transmission infrastructure, solar, wind, and storage resources, and hourly operations, we evaluate the role of transmission across least-cost, socially optimal, and zero-emissions scenarios for 2050. An optimal nationwide plan would more than triple interregional transmission capacity, yet this reduces the cost of a zero-emissions system by only 7% relative to relying on existing transmission, as storage, solar and wind siting, and nuclear generation serve as close substitutes. Regional cost and rent effects vary, with transmission generally favoring wind and hydrogen resources over solar and batteries. Sensitivity analysis shows diminishing returns: one-fifth of the benefits of full expansion can be achieved with one-twelfth of the added capacity, while cost reductions for batteries and hydrogen provide comparable or greater system savings than transmission. Reconductoring -- quadrupling line capacity at half the cost of new builds achieves nearly all the benefits of unconstrained expansion. These results suggest that while substantial transmission expansion is economically justified, a diverse set of flexibility resources can substitute for large-scale grid build-out, and the relative value of transmission is highly contingent on technological and cost developments.

Title: Exploring the Impact of Data Quantity on ASR in Extremely Low-resource Languages
Authors: Yao-Fei Cheng, Li-Wei Chen, Hung-Shin Lee, Hsin-Min Wang
Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of data augmentation techniques for low-resource automatic speech recognition (ASR), focusing on two endangered Austronesian languages, Amis and Seediq. Recognizing the potential of self-supervised learning (SSL) in low-resource settings, we explore the impact of data volume on the continued pre-training of SSL models. We propose a novel data-selection scheme leveraging a multilingual corpus to augment the limited target language data. This scheme utilizes a language classifier to extract utterance embeddings and employs one-class classifiers to identify utterances phonetically and phonologically proximate to the target languages. Utterances are ranked and selected based on their decision scores, ensuring the inclusion of highly relevant data in the SSL-ASR pipeline. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, yielding substantial improvements in ASR performance for both Amis and Seediq. These findings underscore the feasibility and promise of data augmentation through cross-lingual transfer learning for low-resource language ASR.

Title: Noise-Domain Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access
Authors: Erkin Yapici, Yusuf Islam Tek, Ertugrul Basar
Abstract: In this paper, we present noise-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (ND-NOMA), an innovative communication scheme that utilizes the modulation of artificial noise mean and variance to convey information. Distinct from traditional methods such as power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) that heavily rely on successive interference cancellation (SIC), ND-NOMA utilizes the noise domain, considerably reducing power consumption and system complexity. Inspired by noise modulation, ND-NOMA provides lower bit error probability (BEP), making it highly suitable for next-generation Internet-of-things (IoT) networks. Our theoretical analyses and computer simulations reveal that ND-NOMA can achieve exceptionally low bit error rates in both uplink and downlink scenarios, in the presence of Rician fading channels. The proposed multi-user system is supported by a minimum distance detector for mean detection and a threshold-based detector for variance detection, ensuring robust communication in low-power environments. By leveraging the inherent properties of noise, ND-NOMA offers a promising platform for long-term deployments of low-cost and low-complexity devices.

Title: Unified Cross-Modal Image Synthesis with Hierarchical Mixture of Product-of-Experts
Authors: Reuben Dorent, Nazim Haouchine, Alexandra Golby, Sarah Frisken, Tina Kapur, William Wells
Abstract: We propose a deep mixture of multimodal hierarchical variational auto-encoders called MMHVAE that synthesizes missing images from observed images in different modalities. MMHVAE's design focuses on tackling four challenges: (i) creating a complex latent representation of multimodal data to generate high-resolution images; (ii) encouraging the variational distributions to estimate the missing information needed for cross-modal image synthesis; (iii) learning to fuse multimodal information in the context of missing data; (iv) leveraging dataset-level information to handle incomplete data sets at training time. Extensive experiments are performed on the challenging problem of pre-operative brain multi-parametric magnetic resonance and intra-operative ultrasound imaging.

Title: Multi-temporal crack segmentation in concrete structures using deep learning approaches
Authors: Said Harb, Pedro Achanccaray, Mehdi Maboudi, Markus Gerke
Abstract: Cracks are among the earliest indicators of deterioration in concrete structures. Early automatic detection of these cracks can significantly extend the lifespan of critical infrastructures, such as bridges, buildings, and tunnels, while simultaneously reducing maintenance costs and facilitating efficient structural health monitoring. This study investigates whether leveraging multi-temporal data for crack segmentation can enhance segmentation quality. Therefore, we compare a Swin UNETR trained on multi-temporal data with a U-Net trained on mono-temporal data to assess the effect of temporal information compared with conventional single-epoch approaches. To this end, a multi-temporal dataset comprising 1356 images, each with 32 sequential crack propagation images, was created. After training the models, experiments were conducted to analyze their generalization ability, temporal consistency, and segmentation quality. The multi-temporal approach consistently outperformed its mono-temporal counterpart, achieving an IoU of $82.72\%$ and a F1-score of $90.54\%$, representing a significant improvement over the mono-temporal model's IoU of $76.69\%$ and F1-score of $86.18\%$, despite requiring only half of the trainable parameters. The multi-temporal model also displayed a more consistent segmentation quality, with reduced noise and fewer errors. These results suggest that temporal information significantly enhances the performance of segmentation models, offering a promising solution for improved crack detection and the long-term monitoring of concrete structures, even with limited sequential data.

Title: Electrostatic Clutch-Based Mechanical Multiplexer with Increased Force Capability
Authors: Timothy E. Amish, Jeffrey T. Auletta, Chad C. Kessens, Joshua R. Smith, Jeffrey I. Lipton
Abstract: Robotic systems with many degrees of freedom (DoF) are constrained by the demands of dedicating a motor to each joint, and while mechanical multiplexing reduces actuator count, existing clutch designs are bulky, force-limited, or restricted to one output at a time. The problem addressed in this study is how to achieve high-force, multiplexing that supports both simultaneous and sequential control from a single motor. Here we show an electrostatic capstan clutch-based transmission that enables both single-input-single-output (SISO) and single-input-multiple-output (SIMO) multiplexing. We demonstrated these on a four-DoF tendon-driven robotic hand where a single motor achieved output forces up to 212 N, increased vertical grip strength by 4.09 times, and raised horizontal carrying capacity by 354\% over manufacturer specifications. These results demonstrate that electrostatic multiplexing provides versatile actuation, overcoming the limitations of prior systems.

Title: Spatial exponential decay of perturbations in optimal control of general evolution equations
Authors: Simone Göttlich, Benedikt Oppeneiger, Manuel Schaller, Karl Worthmann
Abstract: We analyze the robustness of optimally controlled evolution equations with respect to spatially localized perturbations. We prove that if the involved operators are domain-uniformly stabilizable and detectable, then these localized perturbations only have a local effect on the optimal solution. We characterize this domain-uniform stabilizability and detectability for the transport equation with constant transport velocity, showing that even for unitary semigroups, optimality implies exponential damping. We extend this result to the case of a space-dependent transport velocity. Finally we leverage the results for the transport equation to characterize domain-uniform stabilizability of the wave equation. Numerical examples in one space dimension complement the theoretical results.

Title: Optimized dynamic scheduling of an exclusive bus lane or high occupancy vehicle lane in a bimodal traffic corridor
Authors: Jiaqing Lu, Dian Sheng, Qianwen Guo, Paul Schonfeld
Abstract: Efficient management of traffic corridors is critical for sustaining urban mobility. Exclusive bus lane (EBL) and high occupancy vehicle lane (HOVL) are two prominent strategies for enhancing public transit services and alleviating congestion. EBLs prioritize bus transit by providing dedicated lanes for faster travel times, while HOVLs encourage carpooling by reserving lanes for high-occupancy vehicles. However, static implementations of these policies may underutilize road resources and disrupt general-purpose lanes. Dynamic implementation, based on real-time demand, can potentially maximize road efficiency and minimize negative impacts. This study first compares the mixed traffic policy (MTP), exclusive bus lane policy (EBLP), and high occupancy vehicle lane policy (HOVLP) by formulating the total system costs in the context of a bimodal traffic corridor involving private cars and public buses. Under each lane policy, the bus frequency is optimized together with the modal split equilibrium derived separately. Based on dynamic demand simulated using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (O-U) process, switching thresholds are then derived to identify optimal periods for implementing each policy. Results reveal significant reductions in total system costs with the proposed dynamic policy schedules. Compared to static implementations, the dynamic policy schedules achieve cost reductions of 11.9%, 6.70%, and 43.64% relative to MTP-only, EBLP-only, and HOVLP-only scenarios, respectively. Additionally, in two real case studies of existing EBL and HOVL operations in Seattle, the proposed dynamic policy reduces total costs by 32.5% and 28.6%, respectively. The findings provide valuable insights for policymakers and transit planners, offering a robust framework for dynamically scheduling and integrating EBL and HOVL policies to optimize urban corridor efficiency and reduce overall system costs.

Title: Two-Stage Weighted Projection for Reliable Low-Complexity Cooperative and Non-Cooperative Localization
Authors: Harish K. Dureppagari, R. Michael Buehrer, Harpreet S. Dhillon
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a two-stage weighted projection method (TS-WPM) for time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA)-based localization, providing provable improvements in positioning accuracy, particularly under high geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. TS-WPM employs a two-stage iterative refinement approach that dynamically updates both range and position estimates, effectively mitigating residual errors while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, we extend TS-WPM to support cooperative localization by leveraging two-way time-of-arrival (TW-TOA) measurements, which enhances positioning accuracy in scenarios with limited anchor availability. To analyze TS-WPM, we derive its error covariance matrix and mean squared error (MSE), establishing conditions for its optimality and robustness. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we develop a 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)-compliant analytical framework, incorporating 5G New Radio (NR) physical layer aspects as well as large-scale and small-scale fading. As part of this, we derive a generalized Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for multipath propagation and introduce a novel non-line-of-sight (NLOS) bias model that accounts for propagation conditions and SNR variations. Our evaluations demonstrate that TS-WPM achieves near-CRLB performance and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art weighted nonlinear least squares (WNLS) in high GDOP and low SNR scenarios. Moreover, cooperative localization with TS-WPM significantly enhances accuracy, especially when an insufficient number of anchors (such as 2) are visible. Finally, we analyze the computational complexity of TS-WPM, showing its balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, making it a scalable solution for real-time localization in next-generation networks.

Title: The Inverse Drum Machine: Source Separation Through Joint Transcription and Analysis-by-Synthesis
Authors: Bernardo Torres (S2A, IDS), Geoffroy Peeters (S2A, IDS), Gael Richard (S2A, IDS)
Abstract: We present the Inverse Drum Machine, a novel approach to Drum Source Separation that leverages an analysis-by-synthesis framework combined with deep learning. Unlike recent supervised methods that require isolated stem recordings for training, our approach is trained on drum mixtures with only transcription annotations. IDM integrates Automatic Drum Transcription and One-shot Drum Sample Synthesis, jointly optimizing these tasks in an end-to-end manner. By convolving synthesized one-shot samples with estimated onsets, akin to a drum machine, we reconstruct the individual drum stems and train a Deep Neural Network on the reconstruction of the mixture. Experiments on the StemGMD dataset demonstrate that IDM achieves separation quality comparable to state-of-the-art supervised methods that require isolated stems data.

Title: AudSemThinker: Enhancing Audio-Language Models through Reasoning over Semantics of Sound
Authors: Gijs Wijngaard, Elia Formisano, Michele Esposito, Michel Dumontier
Abstract: Audio-language models have shown promising results in various sound understanding tasks, yet they remain limited in their ability to reason over the fine-grained semantics of sound. In this paper, we present AudSemThinker, a model whose reasoning is structured around a framework of auditory semantics inspired by human cognition. To support this, we introduce AudSem, a novel dataset specifically curated for semantic descriptor reasoning in audio-language models. AudSem addresses the persistent challenge of data contamination in zero-shot evaluations by providing a carefully filtered collection of audio samples paired with captions generated through a robust multi-stage pipeline. Our experiments demonstrate that AudSemThinker outperforms state-of-the-art models across multiple training settings, highlighting its strength in semantic audio reasoning. Both AudSemThinker and the AudSem dataset are released publicly.

Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs) have gained widespread adoption, yet their trustworthiness remains underexplored. Existing evaluation frameworks, designed primarily for text, fail to address unique vulnerabilities introduced by audio's acoustic properties. We identify significant trustworthiness risks in ALLMs arising from non-semantic acoustic cues, including timbre, accent, and background noise, which can manipulate model behavior. We propose AudioTrust, a comprehensive framework for systematic evaluation of ALLM trustworthiness across audio-specific risks. AudioTrust encompasses six key dimensions: fairness, hallucination, safety, privacy, robustness, and authentication. The framework implements 26 distinct sub-tasks using a curated dataset of over 4,420 audio samples from real-world scenarios, including daily conversations, emergency calls, and voice assistant interactions. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across 18 experimental configurations using human-validated automated pipelines. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source ALLMs reveals significant limitations when confronted with diverse high-risk audio scenarios, providing insights for secure deployment of audio models.

Title: Discovering and Steering Interpretable Concepts in Large Generative Music Models
Authors: Nikhil Singh, Manuel Cherep, Pattie Maes
Abstract: The fidelity with which neural networks can now generate content such as music presents a scientific opportunity: these systems appear to have learned implicit theories of such content's structure through statistical learning alone. This offers a potentially new lens on theories of human-generated media. When internal representations align with traditional constructs (e.g. chord progressions in music), they show how such categories can emerge from statistical regularities; when they diverge, they expose limits of existing frameworks and patterns we may have overlooked but that nonetheless carry explanatory power. In this paper, focusing on music generators, we introduce a method for discovering interpretable concepts using sparse autoencoders (SAEs), extracting interpretable features from the residual stream of a transformer model. We make this approach scalable and evaluable using automated labeling and validation pipelines. Our results reveal both familiar musical concepts and coherent but uncodified patterns lacking clear counterparts in theory or language. As an extension, we show such concepts can be used to steer model generations. Beyond improving model transparency, our work provides an empirical tool for uncovering organizing principles that have eluded traditional methods of analysis and synthesis.

Title: Universal Speech Enhancement with Regression and Generative Mamba
Authors: Rong Chao, Rauf Nasretdinov, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang, Ante Jukić, Szu-Wei Fu, Yu Tsao
Abstract: The Interspeech 2025 URGENT Challenge aimed to advance universal, robust, and generalizable speech enhancement by unifying speech enhancement tasks across a wide variety of conditions, including seven different distortion types and five languages. We present Universal Speech Enhancement Mamba (USEMamba), a state-space speech enhancement model designed to handle long-range sequence modeling, time-frequency structured processing, and sampling frequency-independent feature extraction. Our approach primarily relies on regression-based modeling, which performs well across most distortions. However, for packet loss and bandwidth extension, where missing content must be inferred, a generative variant of the proposed USEMamba proves more effective. Despite being trained on only a subset of the full training data, USEMamba achieved 2nd place in Track 1 during the blind test phase, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse conditions.

Title: Ocean Diviner: A Diffusion-Augmented Reinforcement Learning Framework for AUV Robust Control in Underwater Tasks
Authors: Jingzehua Xu, Guanwen Xie, Weiyi Liu, Jiwei Tang, Ziteng Yang, Tianxiang Xing, Yiyuan Yang, Shuai Zhang, Xiaofan Li
Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are essential for marine exploration, yet their control remains highly challenging due to nonlinear dynamics and uncertain environmental disturbances. This paper presents a diffusion-augmented Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for robust AUV control, aiming to improve AUV's adaptability in dynamic underwater environments. The proposed framework integrates two core innovations: (1) A diffusion-based action generation framework that produces physically feasible and high-quality actions, enhanced by a high-dimensional state encoding mechanism combining current observations with historical states and actions through a novel diffusion U-Net architecture, significantly improving long-horizon planning capacity for robust control. (2) A sample-efficient hybrid learning architecture that synergizes diffusion-guided exploration with RL policy optimization, where the diffusion model generates diverse candidate actions and the RL critic selects the optimal action, achieving higher exploration efficiency and policy stability in dynamic underwater environments. Extensive simulation experiments validate the framework's superior robustness and flexibility, outperforming conventional control methods in challenging marine conditions, offering enhanced adaptability and reliability for AUV operations in underwater tasks. Finally, we will release the code publicly soon to support future research in this area.

Title: Taming Diffusion Transformer for Efficient Mobile Video Generation in Seconds
Authors: Yushu Wu, Yanyu Li, Anil Kag, Ivan Skorokhodov, Willi Menapace, Ke Ma, Arpit Sahni, Ju Hu, Aliaksandr Siarohin, Dhritiman Sagar, Yanzhi Wang, Sergey Tulyakov
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have shown strong performance in video generation tasks, but their high computational cost makes them impractical for resource-constrained devices like smartphones, and practical on-device generation is even more challenging. In this work, we propose a series of novel optimizations to significantly accelerate video generation and enable practical deployment on mobile platforms. First, we employ a highly compressed variational autoencoder (VAE) to reduce the dimensionality of the input data without sacrificing visual quality. Second, we introduce a KD-guided, sensitivity-aware tri-level pruning strategy to shrink the model size to suit mobile platforms while preserving critical performance characteristics. Third, we develop an adversarial step distillation technique tailored for DiT, which allows us to reduce the number of inference steps to four. Combined, these optimizations enable our model to achieve approximately 15 frames per second (FPS) generation speed on an iPhone 16 Pro Max, demonstrating the feasibility of efficient, high-quality video generation on mobile devices.

Title: Keep It Real: Challenges in Attacking Compression-Based Adversarial Purification
Authors: Samuel Räber, Till Aczel, Andreas Plesner, Roger Wattenhofer
Abstract: Previous work has suggested that preprocessing images through lossy compression can defend against adversarial perturbations, but comprehensive attack evaluations have been lacking. In this paper, we construct strong white-box and adaptive attacks against various compression models and identify a critical challenge for attackers: high realism in reconstructed images significantly increases attack difficulty. Through rigorous evaluation across multiple attack scenarios, we demonstrate that compression models capable of producing realistic, high-fidelity reconstructions are substantially more resistant to our attacks. In contrast, low-realism compression models can be broken. Our analysis reveals that this is not due to gradient masking. Rather, realistic reconstructions maintaining distributional alignment with natural images seem to offer inherent robustness. This work highlights a significant obstacle for future adversarial attacks and suggests that developing more effective techniques to overcome realism represents an essential challenge for comprehensive security evaluation.

Title: Filling MIDI Velocity using U-Net Image Colorizer
Authors: Zhanhong He, David Cooper, Defeng Huang, Roberto Togneri
Abstract: Modern music producers commonly use MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) to store their musical compositions. However, MIDI files created with digital software may lack the expressive characteristics of human performances, essentially leaving the velocity parameter - a control for note loudness - undefined, which defaults to a flat value. The task of filling MIDI velocity is termed MIDI velocity prediction, which uses regression models to enhance music expressiveness by adjusting only this parameter. In this paper, we introduce the U-Net, a widely adopted architecture in image colorization, to this task. By conceptualizing MIDI data as images, we adopt window attention and develop a custom loss function to address the sparsity of MIDI-converted images. Current dataset availability restricts our experiments to piano data. Evaluated on the MAESTRO v3 and SMD datasets, our proposed method for filling MIDI velocity outperforms previous approaches in both quantitative metrics and qualitative listening tests.

Title: A dataset and model for recognition of audiologically relevant environments for hearing aids: AHEAD-DS and YAMNet+
Authors: Henry Zhong, Jörg M. Buchholz, Julian Maclaren, Simon Carlile, Richard Lyon
Abstract: Scene recognition of audiologically relevant environments is important for hearing aids; however, it is challenging, in part because of the limitations of existing datasets. Datasets often lack public accessibility, completeness, or audiologically relevant labels, hindering systematic comparison of machine learning models. Deploying these models on resource-constrained edge devices presents another challenge. Our solution is two-fold: we leverage several open source datasets to create AHEAD-DS, a dataset designed for scene recognition of audiologically relevant environments, and introduce YAMNet+, a sound recognition model. AHEAD-DS aims to provide a standardised, publicly available dataset with consistent labels relevant to hearing aids, facilitating model comparison. YAMNet+ is designed for deployment on edge devices like smartphones connected to hearing devices, such as hearing aids and wireless earphones with hearing aid functionality; serving as a baseline model for sound-based scene recognition. YAMNet+ achieved a mean average precision of 0.83 and accuracy of 0.93 on the testing set of AHEAD-DS across fourteen categories of audiologically relevant environments. We found that applying transfer learning from the pretrained YAMNet model was essential. We demonstrated real-time sound-based scene recognition capabilities on edge devices by deploying YAMNet+ to an Android smartphone. Even with a Google Pixel 3 (a phone with modest specifications, released in 2018), the model processes audio with approximately 50ms of latency to load the model, and an approximate linear increase of 30ms per 1 second of audio.

Title: Leveraging Mamba with Full-Face Vision for Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement
Authors: Rong Chao, Wenze Ren, You-Jin Li, Kuo-Hsuan Hung, Sung-Feng Huang, Szu-Wei Fu, Wen-Huang Cheng, Yu Tsao
Abstract: Recent Mamba-based models have shown promise in speech enhancement by efficiently modeling long-range temporal dependencies. However, models like Speech Enhancement Mamba (SEMamba) remain limited to single-speaker scenarios and struggle in complex multi-speaker environments such as the cocktail party problem. To overcome this, we introduce AVSEMamba, an audio-visual speech enhancement model that integrates full-face visual cues with a Mamba-based temporal backbone. By leveraging spatiotemporal visual information, AVSEMamba enables more accurate extraction of target speech in challenging conditions. Evaluated on the AVSEC-4 Challenge development and blind test sets, AVSEMamba outperforms other monaural baselines in speech intelligibility (STOI), perceptual quality (PESQ), and non-intrusive quality (UTMOS), and achieves \textbf{1st place} on the monaural leaderboard.

Title: MindVL: Towards Efficient and Effective Training of Multimodal Large Language Models on Ascend NPUs
Authors: Feilong Chen, Yijiang Liu, Yi Huang, Hao Wang, Miren Tian, Ya-Qi Yu, Minghui Liao, Jihao Wu
Abstract: We propose MindVL, a multimodal large language model (MLLMs) trained on Ascend NPUs. The training of state-of-the-art MLLMs is often confined to a limited set of hardware platforms and relies heavily on massive, undisclosed data recipes, which hinders reproducibility and open research. To change the common perception that Ascend hardware is unsuitable for efficient full-stage MLLM training, we introduce MindSpeed-MLLM, a highly efficient training framework that supports stable and high-performance training of large-scale Dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models on Ascend hardware. Based on this, we provide a systematic and open description of the data production methods and mixing strategies for all training stages. Furthermore, we present MindVL, a data-efficient multimodal large language model trained end-to-end on Ascend NPUs. In addition, we find that averaging weights from checkpoints trained with different sequence lengths is particularly effective and yields further gains when combined with test-time resolution search. Our experiments demonstrate superior data efficiency: MindVL-8B matches the performance of Qwen2.5VL-7B using only 10\% of its training data, while our MoE model, MindVL-671B-A37B, matches Qwen2.5VL-72B using only 3\% of the Qwen2.5VL training data, and achieves comparable performance with other leading multimodal MoE models. Our work provides the community with a valuable hardware alternative, open data recipes, and effective performance-enhancing techniques.

Title: Robot Conga: A Leader-Follower Walking Approach to Sequential Path Following in Multi-Agent Systems
Authors: Pranav Tiwari, Soumyodipta Nath
Abstract: Coordinated path following in multi-agent systems is a key challenge in robotics, with applications in automated logistics, surveillance, and collaborative exploration. Traditional formation control techniques often rely on time-parameterized trajectories and path integrals, which can result in synchronization issues and rigid behavior. In this work, we address the problem of sequential path following, where agents maintain fixed spatial separation along a common trajectory, guided by a leader under centralized control. We introduce Robot Conga, a leader-follower control strategy that updates each agent's desired state based on the leader's spatial displacement rather than time, assuming access to a global position reference, an assumption valid in indoor environments equipped with motion capture, vision-based tracking, or UWB localization systems. The algorithm was validated in simulation using both TurtleBot3 and quadruped (Laikago) robots. Results demonstrate accurate trajectory tracking, stable inter-agent spacing, and fast convergence, with all agents aligning within 250 time steps (approx. 0.25 seconds) in the quadruped case, and almost instantaneously in the TurtleBot3 implementation.

Title: StereoFoley: Object-Aware Stereo Audio Generation from Video
Authors: Tornike Karchkhadze, Kuan-Lin Chen, Mojtaba (Moji)Heydari, Robert Henzel, Alessandro Toso, Mehrez Souden, Joshua Atkins
Abstract: We present StereoFoley, a video-to-audio generation framework that produces semantically aligned, temporally synchronized, and spatially accurate stereo sound at 48 kHz. While recent generative video-to-audio models achieve strong semantic and temporal fidelity, they largely remain limited to mono or fail to deliver object-aware stereo imaging, constrained by the lack of professionally mixed, spatially accurate video-to-audio datasets. First, we develop and train a base model that generates stereo audio from video, achieving state-of-the-art in both semantic accuracy and synchronization. Next, to overcome dataset limitations, we introduce a synthetic data generation pipeline that combines video analysis, object tracking, and audio synthesis with dynamic panning and distance-based loudness controls, enabling spatially accurate object-aware sound. Finally, we fine-tune the base model on this synthetic dataset, yielding clear object-audio correspondence. Since no established metrics exist, we introduce stereo object-awareness measures and validate it through a human listening study, showing strong correlation with perception. This work establishes the first end-to-end framework for stereo object-aware video-to-audio generation, addressing a critical gap and setting a new benchmark in the field.

Title: Adapt or Regress: Rate-Memory-Compatible Spatially-Coupled Codes
Authors: Bade Aksoy, Doğukan Özbayrak, Ahmed Hareedy
Abstract: Spatially-coupled (SC) codes are a class of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes that have excellent performance thanks to the degrees of freedom they offer. An SC code is designed by partitioning a base matrix into components, the number of which implies the code memory, then coupling and lifting them. In the same system, various error-correction coding schemes are typically needed. For example, in wireless communication standards, several channel conditions and data rates should be supported. In storage and computing systems, stronger codes should be adopted as the device ages. Adaptive code design enables switching from one code to another when needed, ensuring reliability while reducing hardware cost. In this paper, we introduce a class of reconfigurable SC codes named rate-memory-compatible SC (RMC-SC) codes, which we design probabilistically. In particular, rate compatibility in RMC-SC codes is achieved via increasing the SC code memory, which also makes the codes memory-compatible and improves performance. We express the expected number of short cycles in the SC code protograph as a function of the fixed probability distribution characterizing the already-designed SC code as well as the unknown distribution characterizing the additional components. We use the gradient-descent algorithm to find a locally-optimal distribution, in terms of cycle count, for the new components. The method can be recursively used to design any number of SC codes needed, and we show how to extend it to other cases. Next, we perform the finite-length optimization using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MC$^2$) approach that we update to design the proposed RMC-SC codes. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in cycle counts and remarkable performance gains achieved by RMC-SC codes compared with a literature-based straightforward scheme.

Title: MathBode: Frequency-Domain Fingerprints of LLM Mathematical Reasoning
Authors: Charles L. Wang
Abstract: This paper presents MathBode, a dynamic diagnostic for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Instead of one-shot accuracy, MathBode treats each parametric problem as a system: we drive a single parameter sinusoidally and fit first-harmonic responses of model outputs and exact solutions. This yields interpretable, frequency-resolved metrics -- gain (amplitude tracking) and phase (lag) -- that form Bode-style fingerprints. Across five closed-form families (linear solve, ratio/saturation, compound interest, 2x2 linear systems, similar triangles), the diagnostic surfaces systematic low-pass behavior and growing phase lag that accuracy alone obscures. We compare several models against a symbolic baseline that calibrates the instrument ($G \approx 1$, $\phi \approx 0$). Results separate frontier from mid-tier models on dynamics, providing a compact, reproducible protocol that complements standard benchmarks with actionable measurements of reasoning fidelity and consistency. We open-source the dataset and code to enable further research and adoption.

Title: Simulated Annealing for Multi-Robot Ergodic Information Acquisition Using Graph-Based Discretization
Authors: Benjamin Wong, Aaron Weber, Mohamed M. Safwat, Santosh Devasia, Ashis G. Banerjee
Abstract: One of the goals of active information acquisition using multi-robot teams is to keep the relative uncertainty in each region at the same level to maintain identical acquisition quality (e.g., consistent target detection) in all the regions. To achieve this goal, ergodic coverage can be used to assign the number of samples according to the quality of observation, i.e., sampling noise levels. However, the noise levels are unknown to the robots. Although this noise can be estimated from samples, the estimates are unreliable at first and can generate fluctuating values. The main contribution of this paper is to use simulated annealing to generate the target sampling distribution, starting from uniform and gradually shifting to an estimated optimal distribution, by varying the coldness parameter of a Boltzmann distribution with the estimated sampling entropy as energy. Simulation results show a substantial improvement of both transient and asymptotic entropy compared to both uniform and direct-ergodic searches. Finally, a demonstration is performed with a TurtleBot swarm system to validate the physical applicability of the algorithm.

Title: MeanFlowSE: One-Step Generative Speech Enhancement via MeanFlow
Authors: Yike Zhu, Boyi Kang, Ziqian Wang, Xingchen Li, Zihan Zhang, Wenjie Li, Longshuai Xiao, Wei Xue, Lei Xie
Abstract: Speech enhancement (SE) recovers clean speech from noisy signals and is vital for applications such as telecommunications and automatic speech recognition (ASR). While generative approaches achieve strong perceptual quality, they often rely on multi-step sampling (diffusion/flow-matching) or large language models, limiting real-time deployment. To mitigate these constraints, we present MeanFlowSE, a one-step generative SE framework. It adopts MeanFlow to predict an average-velocity field for one-step latent refinement and conditions the model on self-supervised learning (SSL) representations rather than VAE latents. This design accelerates inference and provides robust acoustic-semantic guidance during training. In the Interspeech 2020 DNS Challenge blind test set and simulated test set, MeanFlowSE attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) level perceptual quality and competitive intelligibility while significantly lowering both real-time factor (RTF) and model size compared with recent generative competitors, making it suitable for practical use. The code will be released upon publication at this https URL.
