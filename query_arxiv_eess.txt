Title: SyncVoice: Towards Video Dubbing with Vision-Augmented Pretrained TTS Model
Authors: Kaidi Wang, Yi He, Wenhao Guan, Weijie Wu, Hongwu Ding, Xiong Zhang, Di Wu, Meng Meng, Jian Luan, Lin Li, Qingyang Hong
Abstract: Video dubbing aims to generate high-fidelity speech that is precisely temporally aligned with the visual content. Existing methods still suffer from limitations in speech naturalness and audio-visual synchronization, and are limited to monolingual settings. To address these challenges, we propose SyncVoice, a vision-augmented video dubbing framework built upon a pretrained text-to-speech (TTS) model. By fine-tuning the TTS model on audio-visual data, we achieve strong audiovisual consistency. We propose a Dual Speaker Encoder to effectively mitigate inter-language interference in cross-lingual speech synthesis and explore the application of video dubbing in video translation scenarios. Experimental results show that SyncVoice achieves high-fidelity speech generation with strong synchronization performance, demonstrating its potential in video dubbing tasks.

Title: GNSS Jammer Direction Finding in Dynamic Scenarios Using an Inertial-based Multi-Antenna System
Authors: Lucas Heublein, Thorsten Nowak, Tobias Feigl, Jaspar Pahl, Felix Ott
Abstract: Jamming devices disrupt signals from the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and pose a significant threat by compromising the reliability of accurate positioning. Consequently, the detection and localization of these interference signals are essential to achieve situational awareness, mitigating their impact, and implementing effective countermeasures. In this paper, we utilize a two-times-two patch antenna system (i.e., the software defined radio device Ettus USRP X440) to predict the angle, elevation, and distance to the jamming source based on in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples. We propose to use an inertial measurement unit (IMU) attached to the antenna system to predict the relative movement of the antenna in dynamic scenarios. We present a synthetic aperture system that enables coherent spatial imaging using platform motion to synthesize larger virtual apertures, offering superior angular resolution without mechanically rotating antennas. While classical angle-of-arrival (AoA) methods exhibit reduced accuracy in multipath environments due to signal reflections and scattering, leading to localization errors, we utilize a methodology that fuses IQ and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-computed spectrograms with 22 AoA features and the predicted relative movement to enhance GNSS jammer direction finding.

Title: Two-Stage Camera Calibration Method for Multi-Camera Systems Using Scene Geometry
Authors: Aleksandr Abramov
Abstract: Calibration of multi-camera systems is a key task for accurate object tracking. However, it remains a challenging problem in real-world conditions, where traditional methods are not applicable due to the lack of accurate floor plans, physical access to place calibration patterns, or synchronized video streams. This paper presents a novel two-stage calibration method that overcomes these limitations. In the first stage, partial calibration of individual cameras is performed based on an operator's annotation of natural geometric primitives (parallel, perpendicular, and vertical lines, or line segments of equal length). This allows estimating key parameters (roll, pitch, focal length) and projecting the camera's Effective Field of View (EFOV) onto the horizontal plane in a base 3D coordinate system. In the second stage, precise system calibration is achieved through interactive manipulation of the projected EFOV polygons. The operator adjusts their position, scale, and rotation to align them with the floor plan or, in its absence, using virtual calibration elements projected onto all cameras in the system. This determines the remaining extrinsic parameters (camera position and yaw). Calibration requires only a static image from each camera, eliminating the need for physical access or synchronized video. The method is implemented as a practical web service. Comparative analysis and demonstration videos confirm the method's applicability, accuracy, and flexibility, enabling the deployment of precise multi-camera tracking systems in scenarios previously considered infeasible.

Title: ARCAS: An Augmented Reality Collision Avoidance System with SLAM-Based Tracking for Enhancing VRU Safety
Authors: Ahmad Yehia, Jiseop Byeon, Tianyi Wang, Huihai Wang, Yiming Xu, Junfeng Jiao, Christian Claudel
Abstract: Vulnerable road users (VRUs) face high collision risks in mixed traffic, yet most existing safety systems prioritize driver or vehicle assistance over direct VRU support. This paper presents ARCAS, a real-time augmented reality collision avoidance system that provides personalized spatial alerts to VRUs via wearable AR headsets. By fusing roadside 360-degree 3D LiDAR with SLAM-based headset tracking and an automatic 3D calibration procedure, ARCAS accurately overlays world-locked 3D bounding boxes and directional arrows onto approaching hazards in the user's passthrough view. The system also enables multi-headset coordination through shared world anchoring. Evaluated in real-world pedestrian interactions with e-scooters and vehicles (180 trials), ARCAS nearly doubled pedestrians' time-to-collision and increased counterparts' reaction margins by up to 4x compared to unaided-eye conditions. Results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of LiDAR-driven AR guidance and highlight the potential of wearable AR as a promising next-generation safety tool for urban mobility.

Title: CATNUS: Coordinate-Aware Thalamic Nuclei Segmentation Using T1-Weighted MRI
Authors: Anqi Feng, Zhangxing Bian, Samuel W. Remedios, Savannah P. Hays, Blake E. Dewey, Alexa Colinco, Jiachen Zhuo, Dan Benjamini, Jerry L. Prince
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of thalamic nuclei from magnetic resonance images is important due to the distinct roles of these nuclei in overall brain function and to their differential involvement in neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, segmentation remains challenging given the small size of many nuclei, limited intrathalamic contrast and image resolution, and inter-subject anatomical variability. In this work, we present CATNUS (Coordinate-Aware Thalamic Nuclei Segmentation), segmenting 13 thalamic nuclei (or nuclear groups) using a 3D U-Net architecture enhanced with coordinate convolution layers, which provide more precise localization of both large and small nuclei. To support broad clinical applicability, we provide pre-trained model variants that can operate on quantitative T1 maps as well as on widely used magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) and fast gray matter acquisition T1 inversion recovery (FGATIR) sequences. We benchmarked CATNUS against established methods, including FreeSurfer, THOMAS and HIPS-THOMAS, demonstrating improved segmentation accuracy and robust test-retest reliability across multiple nuclei. Furthermore, CATNUS demonstrated strong out-of-distribution generalization on traveling-subject datasets spanning multiple scanners, field strengths, and vendors, producing reliable and anatomically coherent segmentations across diverse acquisition conditions. Overall, CATNUS provides an accurate and generalizable solution for thalamic nuclei segmentation, with strong potential to facilitate large-scale neuroimaging studies and support real-world clinical assessment.

Title: Elevation- and Tilt-Aware Shadow Fading Correlation Modeling for UAV Communications
Authors: Mushfiqur Rahman, Ismail Guvenc, Mihail Sichitiu, Jason A. Abrahamson, Bryton J. Petersen, Amitabh Mishra, Arupjyoti Bhuyan
Abstract: Future wireless networks demand a more accurate understanding of channel behavior to enable efficient communication with reduced interference. Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are poised to play an integral role in these networks, offering versatile applications and flexible deployment options. However, accurately characterizing the shadow fading (SF) behavior in UAV communications remains a challenge. Traditional SF correlation models rely on spatial distance and neglect the UAV's 3D orientation and elevation angle. Yet even slight variations in pitch angle (5 to 10 degrees) can significantly affect the signal strength observed by a UAV. In this study, we investigate the impact of UAV pitch and elevation geometry on SF and propose an elevation- and tilt-aware spatial correlation model. We use a real-world fixed-altitude UAV measurement dataset collected in a rural environment at 3.32 GHz with a 125 kHz bandwidth. Results show that a 10-degree tilt-angle separation and a 20-degree elevation-angle separation can reduce the SF correlation by up to 15% and 40%, respectively. In addition, integrating the proposed correlation model into the ordinary Kriging (OK) framework for signal strength prediction yields an approximate 1.5 dB improvement in median RMSE relative to the traditional correlation model that ignores UAV orientation and elevation.

Abstract: In this paper, we compare several representative barrier-like conditions from the literature for infinite-horizon reach-avoid verification of stochastic discrete-time systems. Our comparison examines both their theoretical properties and computational tractability, highlighting each condition's strengths and limitations that affect applicability and conservativeness. Finally, we illustrate their practical performance through computational experiments using semidefinite programming (SDP) and counterexample-guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS).

Title: Noise Suppression for Time Difference of Arrival: Performance Evaluation of a Generalized Cross-Correlation Method Using Mean Signal and Inverse Filter
Authors: Hirotaka Obo, Yuki Fujita, Masahisa Ishii, Hideki Moriyama, Ryota Tsuchiya, Yuta Ohashi, Kotaro Seki
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel generalized cross-correlation (GCC) method, termed GCC-MSIF, to improve time difference of arrival (TDOA) estimation accuracy in noisy environments. Conventional GCC methods often suffer from performance degradation under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, particularly when the signal bandwidth is unknown. GCC-MSIF introduces a "mean signal" estimated from multi-channel inputs and an "inverse filter" to virtually reconstruct the source signal, enabling adaptive suppression of out-of-band noise. Numerical simulations simulating a small-scale array demonstrate that GCC-MSIF significantly outperforms conventional methods, such as GCC-PHAT and GCC-SCOT, in low SNR regions and achieves robustness comparable to or exceeding the maximum likelihood (GCC-ML) method. Furthermore, the estimation accuracy improves scalably with the number of array elements. These results suggest that GCC-MSIF is a promising solution for robust passive localization in practical blind environments.

Title: Hardware-Impaired Over-the-Air Computation with Fluid Antenna Array
Authors: Zilong Li, Jianxin Dai, Zhaohui Yang, Zhaoyang Zhang, Kai-Kit Wong, Zhiyang Li, Shunkuan Cheng
Abstract: This paper investigates a fluid antenna (FA) array-enhanced over-the-air computation (AirComp) system in the presence of hardware impairments (HWIs), exploiting the new degrees of freedom offered by reconfigurable antenna positioning. To minimize the mean squared error (MSE) of the aggregated signal, we jointly optimize transmit power control, receive beamforming, and the antenna position vector (APV), subject to practical constraints such as HWI-induced distortion noise, FA movement energy consumption, and total power budgets. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex and highly coupled. To address it efficiently, we adopt a block coordinate descent (BCD) framework, decomposing it into three manageable subproblems. For each subproblem, closed-form solutions or efficient numerical algorithms are derived. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint transceiver and APV design significantly reduces the MSE compared to conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) arrays and exhibits enhanced robustness against hardware impairments. The effectiveness and convergence of the proposed algorithm are further validated under various system configurations.

Title: Data-Driven Adaptive Output Regulation of Unknown Linear Systems
Authors: Shangkun Liu, Lei Wang, Bowen Yi
Abstract: This paper investigates the linear output regulation problem with both the exosystem and the plant fully unknown. A data-driven regulator is proposed to achieve asymptotic regulation and closed-loop stability without performing model identification. The method constructs a nominal approximate internal model and filters of input and outputs, thereby yielding a stabilizable cascaded nominal system whose states are available. For this nominal system, a stabilizing law is derived from an offline dataset that has been acquired from the plant during experiments, such that the system states exponentially converge to a subspace. An identifier in discrete-time is, then, implemented to correct the internal model and update the stabilizing law; as a result, the regulation error can be steered to zero asymptotically under some persistent excitation conditions.

Title: Image Semantic Communication with Quadtree Partition-based Coding
Authors: Yinhuan Huang, Zhijin Qin
Abstract: Deep learning based semantic communication (DeepSC) system has emerged as a promising paradigm for efficient wireless transmission. However, existing image DeepSC methods, frequently encounter challenges in balancing rate-distortion performance and computational complexity, and often exhibit inferior performance compared to traditional schemes, especially on high-resolution datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a novel image DeepSC system, using quadtree partition-based joint semantic-channel coding, named Quad-DeepSC, which maintains low complexity while achieving state-of-the-art transmission performance. Based on maturing learned image compression technologies, we establish a unified DeepSC system design and training pipeline. The proposed Quad-DeepSC integrates quadtree partition-based entropy estimation and feature coding modules with lightweight feature extraction and reconstruction networks to form an end-to-end architecture. During training, all components except the feature coding modules are jointly optimized as a compact learned image codec, Quad-LIC, for source compression tasks. The pretrained Quad-LIC is then embedded into Quad-DeepSC and fine-tuned end-to-end over wireless channels. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Quad-DeepSC is the first DeepSC system to surpass conventional communication systems, which employ VTM for source coding and adopt the optimal MCS index under 3GPP standards for channel coding and digital modulation, in performance across datasets of varying resolutions. Notably, both Quad-DeepSC and Quad-LIC exhibit minimal latency, rendering them well-suited for deployment in real-time wireless communication systems.

Title: Hybrid modeling approach for better identification of building thermal network model and improved prediction
Authors: Sang woo Ham, Donghun Kim
Abstract: The gray-box modeling approach, which uses a semi-physical thermal network model, has been widely used in building prediction applications, such as model predictive control (MPC). However, unmeasured disturbances, such as occupants, lighting, and in/exfiltration loads, make it challenging to apply this approach to practical buildings. In this study, we propose a hybrid modeling approach that integrates the gray-box model with a model for unmeasured disturbance. After reviewing several system identification approaches, we systematically designed the unmeasured disturbance model with a model selection process based on statistical tests to make it robust. We generated data based on the building model calibrated by real operational data and then trained the hybrid model for two different weather conditions. The Hybrid model approach demonstrates the reduction of RMSE approximately 0.2-0.9C and 0.3-2C on 1-day ahead temperature prediction compared to the Conventional approach for mild (Berkeley, CA) and cold (Chicago, IL) climates, respectively. In addition, this approach was applied for experimental data obtained from the laboratory building to be used for the MPC application, showing superior prediction performances.

Title: Individual Channel Estimation for Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces
Authors: Kangchun Zhao, Yijie Mao
Abstract: Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (BD-RIS) has emerged as a promising evolution of RIS technology. By enabling interconnections between RIS elements, BD-RIS architectures offer greater flexibility in wave manipulation compared to traditional diagonal RIS designs. However, these interconnections introduce new research challenges for channel estimation, making existing approaches developed for conventional diagonal RISs ineffective and significantly increasing pilot overhead. To address these challenges, we propose a novel individual channel estimation framework that separately estimates the BS-RIS channel, which typically remains static over time, and the RIS-user channels, which vary rapidly due to user mobility. Specifically, we develop a full-duplex (FD) approach to estimate the BS-RIS channel by leveraging its inherent sparsity. Following this, the RIS-user channels are estimated using a least squares (LS) approach. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significantly higher channel estimation accuracy, particularly when the number of RIS elements is large, while substantially reducing pilot overhead compared to conventional cascaded channel estimation methods.

Title: Privacy-Preserving Fully Distributed Gaussian Process Regression
Authors: Yeongjun Jang, Kaoru Teranishi, Jihoon Suh, Takashi Tanaka
Abstract: Although distributed Gaussian process regression (GPR) enables multiple agents with separate datasets to jointly learn a model of the target function, its collaborative nature poses risks of private data leakage. To address this, we propose a privacy-preserving fully distributed GPR protocol based on secure multi-party computation (SMPC) that preserves the confidentiality of each agent's local dataset. Building upon a secure distributed average consensus algorithm, the protocol guarantees that each agent's local model practically converges to the same global model that would be obtained by the standard distributed GPR. Further, we adopt the paradigm of simulation based security to provide formal privacy guarantees, and extend the proposed protocol to enable kernel hyperparameter optimization, which is critical yet often overlooked in the literature. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and practical applicability of the proposed method.

Title: Solving Multiparametric Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problems and Explicit Game-Theoretic Model Predictive Control
Authors: Sophie Hall, Alberto Bemporad
Abstract: We present a method to compute explicit solutions of parametric Generalized Nash Equilibrium (GNE) problems with convex quadratic cost functions and linear coupling and local constraints. Assuming the parameters only enter the linear terms of the cost functions and constraint right-hand sides, we provide the exact multiparametric solution of the GNE problem. Such a solution enables (i) minimal real-time computation, (ii) inherent interpretability, explainability, and exact enumeration of all multiple equilibria, (iii) determine desired GNE solution types in the case of infinitely-many equilibria, and (iv) zero-shot updates of the GNE solution due to changes of constraint right-hand sides and/or linear costs. In line with explicit Model Predictive Control (MPC) approaches, we apply our method to solve game-theoretic MPC (Receding Horizon Games) explicitly, comparing performance against centralized solvers in a battery charging game and in a toy two-mass spring system control problem. A Python implementation of the algorithms presented in this paper is available on this https URL.

Title: Constructive boundary observer-based control of high-dimensional semilinear heat equations
Authors: Pengfei Wang, Emilia Fridman
Abstract: This paper presents a constructive finite-dimensional output-feedback design for semilinear $M$-dimensional ($M\geq 2$) heat equations with boundary actuation and sensing. A key challenge in high dimensions is the slower growth rate of the Laplacian eigenvalues. The novel features of our modal-decomposition-based design, which allows to enlarge Lipschitz constants, include a larger class of shape functions that may be distributed over a part of the boundary only, the corresponding lifting transformation and the full-order controller gain found from the design LMIs. We further analyze the robustness of the closed-loop system with respect to either multiplicative noise (vanishing at the origin) or additive noise (persistent). Effective LMI conditions are provided for specifying the minimal observer dimension and maximal Lipschitz constants that preserve the stability (mean-square exponential stability for multiplicative noise and noise-to-state stability for additive noise). Numerical examples for 2D and 3D cases demonstrate the efficacy and advantages of our method.

Title: PAC One-Step Safety Certification for Black-Box Discrete-Time Stochastic Systems
Authors: Taoran Wu, Dominik Wagner, Jingduo Pan, Luke Ong, Arvind Easwaran, Bai Xue
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of safety certification for black-box discrete-time stochastic systems, where both the system dynamics and disturbance distributions are unknown, and only sampled data are available. Under such limited information, ensuring robust or classical quantitative safety over finite or infinite horizons is generally infeasible. To address this challenge, we propose a data-driven framework that provides theoretical one-step safety guarantees in the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) sense. This one-step guarantee can be applied recursively at each time step, thereby yielding step-by-step safety assurances over extended horizons. Our approach formulates barrier certificate conditions based solely on sampled data and establishes PAC safety guarantees by leveraging the VC dimension, scenario approaches, Markov's inequality, and Hoeffding's inequality. Two sampling procedures are proposed, and three methods are proposed to derive PAC safety guarantees. The properties and comparative advantages of these three methods are thoroughly discussed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methods are demonstrated through several numerical examples.

Title: Inverse Linear-Quadratic Gaussian Differential Games
Authors: Lucas Günther, Felix Thömmes, Karl Handwerker, Balint Varga, Sören Hohmann
Abstract: This paper presents a method for solving the Inverse Stochastic Differential Game (ISDG) problem in finite-horizon linear-quadratic Gaussian (LQG) differential games. The objective is to recover cost function parameters of all players, as well as noise scaling parameters of the stochastic system, consistent with observed trajectories. The proposed framework combines (i) estimation of the feedback strategies, (ii) identification of the cost function parameters via a novel reformulation of the coupled Riccati differential equations, and (iii) maximum likelihood estimation of the noise scaling parameters. Simulation results demonstrate that the approach recovers parameters, yielding trajectories that closely match the observed trajectories.

Title: General and Domain-Specific Zero-shot Detection of Generated Images via Conditional Likelihood
Authors: Roy Betser, Omer Hofman, Roman Vainshtein, Guy Gilboa
Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models, particularly diffusion-based methods, has significantly improved the realism of synthetic images. As new generative models continuously emerge, detecting generated images remains a critical challenge. While fully supervised, and few-shot methods have been proposed, maintaining an updated dataset is time-consuming and challenging. Consequently, zero-shot methods have gained increasing attention in recent years. We find that existing zero-shot methods often struggle to adapt to specific image domains, such as artistic images, limiting their real-world applicability. In this work, we introduce CLIDE, a novel zero-shot detection method based on conditional likelihood approximation. Our approach computes likelihoods conditioned on real images, enabling adaptation across diverse image domains. We extensively evaluate CLIDE, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a large-scale general dataset and significantly outperform existing methods in domain-specific cases. These results demonstrate the robustness of our method and underscore the need of broad, domain-aware generalization for the AI-generated image detection task. Code is available at this https URL.

Title: A Non-Invasive Path to Animal Welfare: Contactless Vital Signs and Activity Monitoring of In-Vivo Rodents Using a mm-Wave FMCW Radar
Authors: Tommaso Polonelli, Manuel Glahn, Stefano Kron, Stefan Selbert, Marco Garzola, Michele Magno
Abstract: Monitoring physiological and behavioral parameters of laboratory rodents is fundamental for biomedical research, yet conventional techniques often rely on invasive sensors or frequent handling that can induce stress and compromise data fidelity. To address these limitations, this paper presents a contactless and non-invasive in-vivo monitoring system based on a low-power 60 GHz frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar. The proposed system enables simultaneous detection of rodent activity and vital signs directly within home-cage environments, eliminating the need for implants, electrodes, or human intervention. The hardware platform leverages a compact Infineon BGT60 series radar sensor, optimized for low power consumption and continuous operation. We investigate sensor placement strategies and design a complete signal processing pipeline, including range bin selection, phase extraction, and frequency-domain estimation tailored to rodent vital signs. The system achieves 3 cm and 0.1 m/s sensitivity for motion and activity detection, while allowing discrimination of micro-movements associated with cardiopulmonary activity with a 2 um distance resolution. Experimental validation with two rodents in realistic in-vivo cages demonstrates that the radar can track animal position and extract respiration rates with 2 bpm accuracy. By minimizing stress and disturbance, this work improves both animal welfare and the reliability of physiological measurements, offering a refined alternative to traditional monitoring methods. This work represents the first demonstration of continuous radar-based vital sign monitoring in freely moving rodents within group-housed cages. The proposed approach lays the foundation for scalable, automated, and ethical monitoring solutions in preclinical and translational research.

Title: Supervisory Measurement-Guided Noise Covariance Estimation: Discussing Forward and Reverse Differentiation
Authors: Haoying Li, Yifan Peng, Yuchi Wu, Junfeng Wu
Abstract: Reliable state estimation depends on accurately modeled noise covariances, which are difficult to determine in practice. This paper formulates the noise covariance estimation as a bilevel optimization problem that factorizes the joint likelihood of primary and supervisory measurements to reconcile information exploitation with computational tractability. The factorization converts the nested Bayesian dependency into a Markov-chain structure, allowing efficient computation. At the lower level, a Kalman filter with state augmentation performs such computation. Meanwhile, closed-form forward and reverse differentiation provide efficient gradients for the upper-level updates, and we compare the two models' space and time complexities to inform their practical selection. The upper level subsequently refines the noise covariances to guide the lower-level estimation. Taken together, the proposed algorithms offer a systematic and computationally efficient approach to noise covariance estimation in linear Gaussian systems.

Title: Feedback stabilization of some fourth-order nonlinear parabolic equations with saturated controlsEQUATIONS WITH SATURATED CONTROLS
Authors: Patricio Guzmán, Felipe Labra, Hugo Parada (SPHINX, IECL)
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the internal and boundary stabilization of the Cahn-Hilliard and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations under saturated feedback control. We conduct our study through the spectral analysis of the associated linear operator. We identify a finite number of eigenvalues related to the unstable part of the system and then design a stabilization strategy based on modal decomposition, linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), and geometric conditions on the saturation function. Local exponential stabilization in $H^{2}$ is established.

Title: A Regularization and Active Learning Method for Identification of Quasi Linear Parameter Varying Systems
Authors: Sampath Kumar Mulagaleti, Alberto Bemporad
Abstract: This paper proposes an active learning method for designing experiments to identify quasi-Linear Parameter-Varying (qLPV) models. Since informative experiments are costly, input signals must be selected to maximize information content based on the currently available model. To improve the extrapolation properties of the identified model, we introduce a manifold-regularization strategy that enforces smooth variations in the qLPV dynamics, promoting Linear Time-Varying (LTV) behavior. Using this regularized structure, we propose a new active learning criterion based on path integrals of an inverse-distance variance measure and derive an efficient approximation exploiting the LTV smoothness. Numerical examples show that the proposed regularization enhances qLPV extrapolation and that the resulting active learning scheme accelerates the identification process.

Title: A Note on Emergent Behavior in Multi-agent Systems Enabled by Neuro-spike Communication
Authors: Hyeonyeong Jang, Donghyeon Song, Jin Gyu Lee, Hyungbo Shim
Abstract: In this note, we present a novel synchronization framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems enabled by neuro-spike communication, which induces emergence. Unlike conventional synchronization strategies that require continuous transmission of full-state data packets, our approach utilizes a bio-inspired neuromorphic amplifier to achieve practical synchronization via intermittent, 1-bit Dirac delta pulses. The proposed method drastically improves communication efficiency in terms of bandwidth and energy by minimizing the information payload to a single bit, with intermittent and asynchronous communication. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis of the proposed method and validate the proposed scheme through numerical examples.

Title: Over-the-Air Semantic Alignment with Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces
Authors: Mario Edoardo Pandolfo, Kyriakos Stylianopoulos, George C. Alexandropoulos, Paolo Di Lorenzo
Abstract: Semantic communication systems aim to transmit task-relevant information between devices capable of artificial intelligence, but their performance can degrade when heterogeneous transmitter-receiver models produce misaligned latent representations. Existing semantic alignment methods typically rely on additional digital processing at the transmitter or receiver, increasing overall device complexity. In this work, we introduce the first over-the-air semantic alignment framework based on stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM), which enables latent-space alignment directly in the wave domain, reducing substantially the computational burden at the device level. We model SIMs as trainable linear operators capable of emulating both supervised linear aligners and zero-shot Parseval-frame-based equalizers. To realize these operators physically, we develop a gradient-based optimization procedure that tailors the metasurface transfer function to a desired semantic mapping. Experiments with heterogeneous vision transformer (ViT) encoders show that SIMs can accurately reproduce both supervised and zero-shot semantic equalizers, achieving up to 90% task accuracy in regimes with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), while maintaining strong robustness even at low SNR values.

Title: LA-RL: Language Action-guided Reinforcement Learning with Safety Guarantees for Autonomous Highway Driving
Authors: Yiming Shu, Jiahui Xu, Jiwei Tang, Ruiyang Gao, Chen Sun
Abstract: Autonomous highway driving demands a critical balance between proactive, efficiency-seeking behavior and robust safety guarantees. This paper proposes Language Action-guided Reinforcement Learning (LA-RL) with Safety Guarantees, a novel framework that integrates the semantic reasoning of large language models (LLMs) into the actor-critic architecture with an improved safety layer. Within this framework, task-specific reward shaping harmonizes the dual objectives of maximizing driving efficiency and ensuring safety, guiding decision-making based on both environmental insights and clearly defined goals. To enhance safety, LA-RL incorporates a safety-critical planner that combines model predictive control (MPC) with discrete control barrier functions (DCBFs). This layer formally constrains the LLM-informed policy to a safe action set, employs a slack mechanism that enhances solution feasibility, prevents overly conservative behavior and allows for greater policy exploration without compromising safety. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it significantly outperforms several current state-of-the-art methods, offering a more adaptive, reliable, and robust solution for autonomous highway driving. Compared to existing SOTA, it achieves approximately 20$\%$ higher success rate than the knowledge graph (KG) based baseline and about 30$\%$ higher than the retrieval augmented generation (RAG) based baseline. In low-density environments, LA-RL achieves a 100$\%$ success rate. These results confirm its enhanced exploration of the state-action space and its ability to autonomously adopt more efficient, proactive strategies in complex, mixed-traffic highway environments.

Title: IMMPC: An Internal Model Based MPC for Rejecting Unknown Disturbances
Authors: Felix Brändle, Frank Allgöwer
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is a powerful control method that allows to directly include state and input constraints into the controller design. However, errors in the model, e.g., caused by unknown disturbances, can lead to constraint violation, loss of feasibility and deteriorate closed-loop performance. In this paper, we propose a new MPC scheme based on the internal model principle. This enables the MPC to reject unknown disturbances provided that the dynamics of the linear signal generator are known. We reformulate the output regulation problem as a stability problem, to ensure feasibility, constraint satisfaction, and convergence to the optimal reachable setpoint. The controller is validated on a real fourtank system.

Title: A Multi-Channel Auditory Signal Encoder with Adaptive Resolution Using Volatile Memristors
Authors: Dongxu Guo, Deepika Yadav, Patrick Foster, Spyros Stathopoulos, Mingyi Chen, Themis Prodromakis, Shiwei Wang
Abstract: We demonstrate and experimentally validate an end-to-end hybrid CMOS-memristor auditory encoder that realises adaptive-threshold, asynchronous delta-modulation (ADM)-based spike encoding by exploiting the inherent volatility of HfTiOx devices. A spike-triggered programming pulse rapidly raises the ADM threshold Delta (desensitisation); the device's volatility then passively lowers Delta when activity subsides (resensitisation), emphasising onsets while restoring sensitivity without static control energy. Our prototype couples an 8-channel 130 nm encoder IC to off-chip HfTiOx devices via a switch interface and an off-chip controller that monitors spike activity and issues programming events. An on-chip current-mirror transimpedance amplifier (TIA) converts device current into symmetric thresholds, enabling both sensitive and conservative encoding regimes. Evaluated with gammatone-filtered speech, the adaptive loop-at matched spike budget-sharpens onsets and preserves fine temporal detail that a fixed-Delta baseline misses; multi-channel spike cochleagrams show the same trend. Together, these results establish a practical hybrid CMOS-memristor pathway to onset-salient, spike-efficient neuromorphic audio front-ends and motivate low-power single-chip integration.

Title: Exploiting Spatial Multiplexing Based on Pixel Antennas: An Antenna Coding Approach
Authors: Zixiang Han, Shanpu Shen, Ross Murch
Abstract: An antenna coding approach for exploiting the spatial multiplexing capability of pixel antennas is proposed. This approach can leverage additional degrees of freedom in the beamspace domain to transmit more information streams. Pixel antennas are a general reconfigurable antenna design where a radiating structure with arbitrary shape and size can be discretized into sub-wavelength elements called pixels which are connected by radio frequency switches. By controlling the switch states, the pixel antenna topology can be flexibly adjusted so that the resulting radiation pattern can be reconfigured for beamspace spatial multiplexing. In this work, we introduce the antenna coder and pattern coder for pixel antennas, provide a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system model with antenna coding in the beamspace domain, and derive the spectral efficiency. Utilizing the antenna coder, the radiation pattern of the pixel antenna is analyzed and efficient optimization algorithms are provided for antenna coding design. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed technique using pixel antennas can enhance spectral efficiency of 4-by-4 MIMO by up to 12 bits/s/Hz or equivalently reduce the required transmit power by up to 90% when compared to conventional MIMO, demonstrating the effectiveness of the antenna coding technique in spectral efficiency enhancement and its promise for future sixth generation (6G) wireless communication.

Title: Codebook-based Port Selection and Combining for CSI-Free Uplink Fluid Antenna Multiple Access
Authors: Chenguang Rao, Kai-Kit Wong, Sai Xu, Xusheng Zhu, Yangyang Zhang, Chan-Byoung Chae
Abstract: Fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA) has recently emerged as a simple, promising scheme for large-scale multiuser connectivity, offering strong scalability with low implementation complexity. Nevertheless, most existing FAMA studies focus on downlink transmission under perfect channel state information (CSI) at the receiver side, while the uplink counterpart remains largely unexplored. This paper proposes a novel codebook-based port selection and combining (CPSC) FAMA framework for the uplink communications without CSI at the base station (BS). In the proposed scheme, a predefined codebook is designed and broadcast by the BS. Each user equipment (UE) employs a fluid antenna, acquires its local CSI and independently chooses the most suitable codeword, activates the corresponding fluid antenna ports, and determines the combining weights to achieve a two-way match between the selected codeword and the instantaneous effective channel. The BS then separates the superimposed user signals through codebook-guided projection operations without requiring global CSI or multiuser joint optimization. To handle potential codeword collisions, three lightweight scheduling strategies are introduced, offering flexible trade-offs between signaling overhead and collision avoidance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CPSC-FAMA approach achieves substantially higher rates than fixed-antenna systems while maintaining low complexity. Moreover, the results confirm that amortizing the optimization cost over the UEs effectively reduces the BS processing burden and enhances scalability, making the proposed scheme a strong candidate for future sixth-generation (6G) networks.

Title: Radar Network Waveform Design for Target Tracking
Authors: Tao Fan, Augusto Aubry, Antonio De Maio, Luca Pallotta, Xianxiang Yu, Guolong Cui
Abstract: This paper addresses the synthesis of slow-time coded waveforms for single target tracking in a radar network operating under colored Gaussian interference. Based on the Posterior Cramér Rao Lower Bound (PCRLB), which characterizes the theoretically optimal accuracy of target state estimation, the problem at each tracking frame is formulated as the minimization of the trace of the PCRLB, together with power budget requirements and a similarity constraint to account for transmitter limitations and appropriate waveform features. To tackle this challenging optimization problem, an approximation solution technique is proposed, aimed at better tracking accuracy than the reference code. The resulting approximated problems, endowed with more tractable objective functions through Taylor-series expansion, are solved using a customized block Majorization-Minimization (block-MM) algorithm. The convergence properties of the developed procedure are thoroughly analyzed. Numerical results illustrate the accuracy improvements in the target state estimation process, and robust tracking performance under uncertain target state conditions achieved by the proposed technique.

Title: Pauli Decomposition of Impedance Matrices for Understanding the Root Cause of Instabilities in Grid-Connected Power Electronic Converters
Authors: Josue Andino, Milan Prodanovic, Javier Roldan-Perez
Abstract: The impedance criterion has emerged as an alternative way to stability assessment of grid-connected power electronic converters. However, the lack of physical meaning of impedance and admittance matrices hinders the ability to understand the root cause of instabilities. To address this issue, this paper proposes the application of Pauli decomposition to the impedance matrices and the minor loop of grid-connected power electronic converters. The application of this methodology simplifies establishing the link between impedance matrix terms and closed-loop stability properties. Moreover, Pauli decomposition transforms impedance matrices in a quaternion-like form that is helpful to assess the root cause of instabilities. The theoretical contributions are validated using a case study consisting of a power electronic converter connected to a weak grid that has been previously analysed in the literature using existing techniques.

Title: Task-Specific Trust Evaluation for Multi-Hop Collaborator Selection via GNN-Aided Distributed Agentic AI
Authors: Botao Zhu, Xianbin Wang, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: The success of collaborative task completion among networked devices hinges on the effective selection of trustworthy collaborators. However, accurate task-specific trust evaluation of multi-hop collaborators can be extremely complex. The reason is that their trust evaluation is determined by a combination of diverse trust-related perspectives with different characteristics, including historical collaboration reliability, volatile and sensitive conditions of available resources for collaboration, as well as continuously evolving network topologies. To address this challenge, this paper presents a graph neural network (GNN)-aided distributed agentic AI (GADAI) framework, in which different aspects of devices' task-specific trustworthiness are separately evaluated and jointly integrated to facilitate multi-hop collaborator selection. GADAI first utilizes a GNN-assisted model to infer device trust from historical collaboration data. Specifically, it employs GNN to propagate and aggregate trust information among multi-hop neighbours, resulting in more accurate device reliability evaluation. Considering the dynamic and privacy-sensitive nature of device resources, a privacy-preserving resource evaluation mechanism is implemented using agentic AI. Each device hosts a large AI model-driven agent capable of autonomously determining whether its local resources meet the requirements of a given task, ensuring both task-specific and privacy-preserving trust evaluation. By combining the outcomes of these assessments, only the trusted devices can coordinate a task-oriented multi-hop cooperation path through their agents in a distributed manner. Experimental results show that our proposed GADAI outperforms the comparison algorithms in planning multi-hop paths that maximize the value of task completion.

Title: Safe Output Regulation of Coupled Hyperbolic PDE-ODE Systems
Authors: Ji Wang, Miroslav Krstic
Abstract: This paper presents a safe output regulation control strategy for a class of systems modeled by a coupled $2\times 2$ hyperbolic PDE-ODE structure, subject to fully distributed disturbances throughout the system. A state-feedback controller is developed by the {nonovershooting backstepping} method to simultaneously achieve exponential output regulation and enforce safety constraints on the system output, which is the state furthest from the control input. To handle unmeasured PDE states and external disturbances, a state observer and a disturbance estimator are designed. Explicit bounds on the estimation errors are derived and used to construct a robust safe regulator that accounts for the uncertainties. The proposed control scheme guarantees that: 1) If the system output is initially within the safe region, it remains there; otherwise, it will be rescued to the safety within a prescribed time; 2) The output tracking error converges to zero exponentially; 3) The observer accurately estimates both the distributed states and external disturbances, with estimation errors converging to zero exponentially; 4) All signals in the closed-loop system remain bounded. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a UAV delivery scenario with a cable-suspended payload, where the payload is regulated to track a desired reference while avoiding collisions with barriers.

Title: 3D-ICE 4.0: Accurate and efficient thermal modeling for 2.5D/3D heterogeneous chiplet systems
Authors: Kai Zhu, Darong Huang, Luis Costero, David Atienza
Abstract: The increasing power densities and intricate heat dissipation paths in advanced 2.5D/3D chiplet systems necessitate thermal modeling frameworks that deliver detailed thermal maps with high computational efficiency. Traditional compact thermal models (CTMs) often struggle to scale with the complexity and heterogeneity of modern architectures. This work introduces 3D-ICE 4.0, designed for heterogeneous chip-based systems. Key innovations include: (i) preservation of material heterogeneity and anisotropy directly from industrial layouts, integrated with OpenMP and SuperLU MT-based parallel solvers for scalable performance, (ii) adaptive vertical layer partitioning to accurately model vertical heat conduction, and (iii) temperature-aware non-uniform grid generation. The results with different benchmarks demonstrate that 3D-ICE 4.0 achieves speedups ranging from 3.61x-6.46x over state-of-the-art tools, while reducing grid complexity by more than 23.3% without compromising accuracy. Compared to the commercial software COMSOL, 3D-ICE 4.0 effectively captures both lateral and vertical heat flows, validating its precision and robustness. These advances demonstrate that 3D-ICE 4.0 is an efficient solution for thermal modeling in emerging heterogeneous 2.5D/3D integrated systems.

Title: Advanced Hybrid Automated Insulin Delivery System based on Successive Linearization Model Predictive Control: The UniBE System
Authors: Vihangkumar V. Naik, Eleonora Manzoni, Clara Escorihuela-Altaba, Jose Garcia-Tirado
Abstract: Background and objective: Hybrid automated insulin delivery (hAID) systems represent the most advanced therapy for type 1 diabetes (T1D). Current systems rely on linear or linearized models of glucose homeostasis, which may compromise prediction accuracy and, in turn, timely decision-making by the controller. Physiological variability further complicates insulin requirements, underscoring the need for controllers that adapt dynamically and reduce user burden. Methods: We introduce the University of Bern (UniBE) hAID system, a framework based on successive linearization model predictive control (MPC). The controller integrates basal insulin infusion with the insulin bolus delivery module for meal-related and corrective bolus dosing, adapting bounds in real time to glucose dynamics while accounting for both automated and user-initiated inputs. In-silico evaluation was conducted using the commercial version of the FDA-accepted UVa/Padova metabolic simulator across nine scenarios involving persistent and time-varying errors in meal timing, carbohydrate estimation, and basal insulin profiles. Results: In the baseline scenario, UniBE achieved a mean time in range of 92.0+-13.2%, with time below range at 0.1+-0.2% and time above range at 7.9+-13.2%. Across perturbation scenarios, time in range remained between 75.1 and 92.8%, with low hypoglycemia incidence, demonstrating resilience to clinically relevant disturbances.

Title: A Hybrid Dynamic Model for Predicting Human Cognition and Reliance during Automated Driving
Authors: Sibibalan Jeevanandam, Neera Jain
Abstract: We propose a simple (12 parameter) hybrid dynamic model that simultaneously captures the continuous-valued dynamics of three human cognitive states-trust, perceived risk, and mental workload-as well as discrete transitions in reliance on the automation. The discrete-time dynamic evolution of each cognitive state is modeled using a first-order affine difference equation. Reliance is defined as a single discrete-valued state, whose evolution at each time step depends on the cognitive states satisfying certain threshold conditions. Using data collected from 16 participants, we estimate participant-specific model parameters based on their reliance on the automation and intermittently self-reported cognitive states during a continuous drive in a vehicle simulator. The model can be estimated using a single user's trajectory data (e.g. 8 minutes of driving), making it suitable for online parameter adaptation methods. Our results show that the model fits the observed trajectories well for several participants, with their reliance behavior primarily influenced by trust, perceived risk, or both. Importantly, the model is interpretable, such that the variations in model parameters across participants provide insights into differences in the time scales over which cognitive states evolve, and how these states are influenced by task complexity. Implications on the design of human-centric vehicle automation design are discussed.

Title: InstructMPC: A Human-LLM-in-the-Loop Framework for Context-Aware Power Grid Control
Authors: Ruixiang Wu, Jiahao Ai, Tinko Sebastian Bartels
Abstract: The transition toward power grids with high renewable penetration demands context-aware decision making frameworks. Traditional operational paradigms, which rely on static optimization of history-based load forecasting, often fail to capture the complex nature of real-time operational conditions, such as operator-issued maintenance mandates, emergency topology changes, or event-driven load surges. To address this challenge, we introduce InstructMPC, a closed-loop framework that integrates Large Language Models~(LLMs) to generate context-aware predictions, enabling the controller to optimize power system operation. Our method employs a Contextual Disturbances Predictor~(CDP) module to translate contextual information into predictive disturbance trajectories, which are then incorporated into the Model Predictive Control~(MPC) optimization. Unlike conventional open-loop forecasting frameworks, InstructMPC features an online tuning mechanism where the predictor's parameters are continuously updated based on the realized control cost with a theoretical guarantee, achieving a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T \log T})$ for linear dynamics when optimized via a tailored loss function, ensuring task-aware learning and adaption to non-stationary grid conditions.

Title: Log-linear Dynamic Inversion for Thrusting Spacecraft on SE2(3)
Authors: Micah K. Condie, Abigaile E. Woodbury, Li-Yu Lin, Kartik A. Pant, Mike Walker, James Goppert
Abstract: We show that the dynamics of a thrusting spacecraft can be embedded in the Lie group SE2(3) in a form that is group-affine with application of a feed-forward control law. This structure implies that the configuration-tracking error evolves exactly linearly in the associated Lie algebra coordinates (log-linear dynamics), rather than arising from a local linearization of the nonlinear system. As a result, a broad class of linear analysis and synthesis tools becomes directly applicable to powered spacecraft motion on SE2(3). A simple numerical example confirms that the error predicted by the linear Lie-algebra dynamics matches the error computed from the full nonlinear system, illustrating the exact log-linear behavior. This foundational property opens a path toward rigorous tools for satellite docking, autonomous rendezvous and proximity operations, robust controller design, and convex safety certification-capabilities that are difficult to achieve with classical local linearizations such as Tschauner-Hempel/Yamanaka-Ankersen (TH/YA).

Title: A Residual Variance Matching Recursive Least Squares Filter for Real-time UAV Terrain Following
Authors: Xiaobo Wu, Youmin Zhang
Abstract: Accurate real-time waypoints estimation for the UAV-based online Terrain Following during wildfire patrol missions is critical to ensuring flight safety and enabling wildfire detection. However, existing real-time filtering algorithms struggle to maintain accurate waypoints under measurement noise in nonlinear and time-varying systems, posing risks of flight instability and missed wildfire detections during UAV-based terrain following. To address this issue, a Residual Variance Matching Recursive Least Squares (RVM-RLS) filter, guided by a Residual Variance Matching Estimation (RVME) criterion, is proposed to adaptively estimate the real-time waypoints of nonlinear, time-varying UAV-based terrain following systems. The proposed method is validated using a UAV-based online terrain following system within a simulated terrain environment. Experimental results show that the RVM-RLS filter improves waypoints estimation accuracy by approximately 88$\%$ compared with benchmark algorithms across multiple evaluation metrics. These findings demonstrate both the methodological advances in real-time filtering and the practical potential of the RVM-RLS filter for UAV-based online wildfire patrol.

Title: Speech World Model: Causal State-Action Planning with Explicit Reasoning for Speech
Authors: Xuanru Zhou, Jiachen Lian, Henry Hong, Xinyi Yang, Gopala Anumanchipalli
Abstract: Current speech-language models (SLMs) typically use a cascade of speech encoder and large language model, treating speech understanding as a single black box. They analyze the content of speech well but reason weakly about other aspects, especially under sparse supervision. Thus, we argue for explicit reasoning over speech states and actions with modular and transparent decisions. Inspired by cognitive science we adopt a modular perspective and a world model view in which the system learns forward dynamics over latent states. We factorize speech understanding into four modules that communicate through a causal graph, establishing a cognitive state search space. Guided by posterior traces from this space, an instruction-tuned language model produces a concise causal analysis and a user-facing response, enabling counterfactual interventions and interpretability under partial supervision. We present the first graph based modular speech model for explicit reasoning and we will open source the model and data to promote the development of advanced speech understanding.

Title: Adaptive Parameter Control Using AAN for Lower Limb Rehabilitation Exoskeletons
Authors: Zheng Sun, Wenkong Wang, Zizhong Wei, Xin Ma
Abstract: Exoskeletons play a crucial role in assisting patients with varying mobility levels during rehabilitation. However, existing control strategies face challenges such as imprecise trajectory tracking, interaction torque oscillations, and limited adaptability to diverse patient conditions. To address these issues, this paper proposes an assist-as-needed (AAN) control algorithm that integrates a human-robot coupling dynamics model, a human torque-momentum observer (HTMO), and an adaptive parameter controller (APC). The algorithm first employs inverse dynamics to compute the joint torques required for the rehabilitation trajectory. The HTMO then estimates the torque exerted by the patient's joints and determines the torque error, which the exoskeleton compensates for via a spring-damper system, ultimately generating the target trajectory. Finally, the APC ensures adaptive assistive control. The proposed method is validated for its effectiveness in MATLAB/Simulink.

Title: XR-DT: Extended Reality-Enhanced Digital Twin for Agentic Mobile Robots
Authors: Tianyi Wang, Jiseop Byeon, Ahmad Yehia, Huihai Wang, Yiming Xu, Tianyi Zeng, Ziran Wang, Junfeng Jiao, Christian Claudel
Abstract: As mobile robots increasingly operate alongside humans in shared workspaces, ensuring safe, efficient, and interpretable Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has become a pressing challenge. While substantial progress has been devoted to human behavior prediction, limited attention has been paid to how humans perceive, interpret, and trust robots' inferences, impeding deployment in safety-critical and socially embedded environments. This paper presents XR-DT, an eXtended Reality-enhanced Digital Twin framework for agentic mobile robots, that bridges physical and virtual spaces to enable bi-directional understanding between humans and robots. Our hierarchical XR-DT architecture integrates virtual-, augmented-, and mixed-reality layers, fusing real-time sensor data, simulated environments in the Unity game engine, and human feedback captured through wearable AR devices. Within this framework, we design an agentic mobile robot system with a unified diffusion policy for context-aware task adaptation. We further propose a chain-of-thought prompting mechanism that allows multimodal large language models to reason over human instructions and environmental context, while leveraging an AutoGen-based multi-agent coordination layer to enhance robustness and collaboration in dynamic tasks. Initial experimental results demonstrate accurate human and robot trajectory prediction, validating the XR-DT framework's effectiveness in HRI tasks. By embedding human intention, environmental dynamics, and robot cognition into the XR-DT framework, our system enables interpretable, trustworthy, and adaptive HRI.

Title: Disturbance Compensation for Safe Kinematic Control of Robotic Systems with Closed Architecture
Authors: Fan Zhang, Jinfeng Chen, Joseph J. B. Mvogo Ahanda, Hanz Richter, Ge Lv, Bin Hu, Qin Lin
Abstract: In commercial robotic systems, it is common to encounter a closed inner-loop torque controller that is not user-modifiable. However, the outer-loop controller, which sends kinematic commands such as position or velocity for the inner-loop controller to track, is typically exposed to users. In this work, we focus on the development of an easily integrated add-on at the outer-loop layer by combining disturbance rejection control and robust control barrier function for high-performance tracking and safe control of the whole dynamic system of an industrial manipulator. This is particularly beneficial when 1) the inner-loop controller is imperfect, unmodifiable, and uncertain; and 2) the dynamic model exhibits significant uncertainty. Stability analysis, formal safety guarantee proof, and hardware experiments with a PUMA robotic manipulator are presented. Our solution demonstrates superior performance in terms of simplicity of implementation, robustness, tracking precision, and safety compared to the state of the art. Video: this https URL

Title: Symmetric Linear Dynamical Systems are Learnable from Few Observations
Authors: Minh Vu, Andrey Y. Lokhov, Marc Vuffray
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the parameters of a $N$-dimensional stochastic linear dynamics under both full and partial observations from a single trajectory of time $T$. We introduce and analyze a new estimator that achieves a small maximum element-wise error on the recovery of symmetric dynamic matrices using only $T=\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ observations, irrespective of whether the matrix is sparse or dense. This estimator is based on the method of moments and does not rely on problem-specific regularization. This is especially important for applications such as structure discovery.

Title: Spatiotemporal Tubes for Differential Drive Robots with Model Uncertainty
Authors: Ratnangshu Das, Ahan Basu, Christos Verginis, Pushpak Jagtap
Abstract: This paper presents a Spatiotemporal Tube (STT)-based control framework for differential-drive mobile robots with dynamic uncertainties and external disturbances, guaranteeing the satisfaction of Temporal Reach-Avoid-Stay (T-RAS) specifications. The approach employs circular STT, characterized by smoothly time-varying center and radius, to define dynamic safe corridors that guide the robot from the start region to the goal while avoiding obstacles. In particular, we first develop a sampling-based synthesis algorithm to construct a feasible STT that satisfies the prescribed timing and safety constraints with formal guarantees. To ensure that the robot remains confined within this tube, we then design analytically a closed-form, approximation-free control law. The resulting controller is computationally efficient, robust to disturbances and {model uncertainties}, and requires no model approximations or online optimization. The proposed framework is validated through simulation studies on a differential-drive robot and benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness, accuracy, and computational efficiency.

Title: SSDLabeler: Realistic semi-synthetic data generation for multi-label artifact classification in EEG
Authors: Taketo Akama, Akima Connelly, Shun Minamikawa, Natalia Polouliakh
Abstract: EEG recordings are inherently contaminated by artifacts such as ocular, muscular, and environmental noise, which obscure neural activity and complicate preprocessing. Artifact classification offers advantages in stability and transparency, providing a viable alternative to ICA-based methods that enable flexible use alongside human inspections and across various applications. However, artifact classification is limited by its training data as it requires extensive manual labeling, which cannot fully cover the diversity of real-world EEG. Semi-synthetic data (SSD) methods have been proposed to address this limitation, but prior approaches typically injected single artifact types using ICA components or required separately recorded artifact signals, reducing both the realism of the generated data and the applicability of the method. To overcome these issues, we introduce SSDLabeler, a framework that generates realistic, annotated SSDs by decomposing real EEG with ICA, epoch-level artifact verification using RMS and PSD criteria, and reinjecting multiple artifact types into clean data. When applied to train a multi-label artifact classifier, it improved accuracy on raw EEG across diverse conditions compared to prior SSD and raw EEG training, establishing a scalable foundation for artifact handling that captures the co-occurrence and complexity of real EEG.

Title: Decoding Selective Auditory Attention to Musical Elements in Ecologically Valid Music Listening
Authors: Taketo Akama, Zhuohao Zhang, Tsukasa Nagashima, Takagi Yutaka, Shun Minamikawa, Natalia Polouliakh
Abstract: Art has long played a profound role in shaping human emotion, cognition, and behavior. While visual arts such as painting and architecture have been studied through eye tracking, revealing distinct gaze patterns between experts and novices, analogous methods for auditory art forms remain underdeveloped. Music, despite being a pervasive component of modern life and culture, still lacks objective tools to quantify listeners' attention and perceptual focus during natural listening experiences. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to decode selective attention to musical elements using naturalistic, studio-produced songs and a lightweight consumer-grade EEG device with only four electrodes. By analyzing neural responses during real world like music listening, we test whether decoding is feasible under conditions that minimize participant burden and preserve the authenticity of the musical experience. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) decoding music attention in real studio-produced songs, (ii) demonstrating feasibility with a four-channel consumer EEG, (iii) providing insights for music attention decoding, and (iv) demonstrating improved model ability over prior work. Our findings suggest that musical attention can be decoded not only for novel songs but also across new subjects, showing performance improvements compared to existing approaches under our tested conditions. These findings show that consumer-grade devices can reliably capture signals, and that neural decoding in music could be feasible in real-world settings. This paves the way for applications in education, personalized music technologies, and therapeutic interventions.

Title: CryoDE: a Digital Cryogenic Detector Emulator for Microwave SQUID Multiplexed Systems
Authors: Timo Muscheid, Daniel Crovo, Robert Gartmann, Eduardo Gerlein, Oliver Sander, Sebastian Kempf, Luis E. Ardila-Perez
Abstract: Simultaneous readout of large-scale cryogenic detector arrays relies on multiplexing schemes such as the FDM (Frequency-Division Multiplexing) with microwave SQUID multiplexers and highly customized readout electronics. In traditional detector systems, where mixed-signal ASICs are used in detector front-ends and typically provide a digital interface, HIL (Hardware-in-the-Loop) testing can be readily implemented by reusing the existing digital logic of the front-end for emulation purposes. Such straightforward emulation is not possible for FDM low-temperature detectors, where the sensor signal is encoded in a high-frequency microwave carrier via a two-stage modulation scheme depending on the cryogenic resonators and the SQUID response. To address this challenge, we present CryoDE, a digital cryogenic-detector emulator for microwave SQUID multiplexed detector systems. CryoDE generates the encoded detector signals, including realistic pulse responses, enabling full HIL testing of the room-temperature DAQ system without requiring the cryogenic hardware. This resource-efficient FPGA-based detector twin integrates seamlessly into existing DAQ systems and allows experiment-specific adjustment of detector-signal parameters. We describe the internal architecture and capabilities of CryoDE within our custom HIL framework and demonstrate its use in evaluating the performance of real-time signal processing firmware optimized for different microwave SQUID multiplexed cryogenic-detector experiments.

Title: Wasserstein distance based semi-supervised manifold learning and application to GNSS multi-path detection
Authors: Antoine Blais, Nicolas Couëllan
Abstract: The main objective of this study is to propose an optimal transport based semi-supervised approach to learn from scarce labelled image data using deep convolutional networks. The principle lies in implicit graph-based transductive semi-supervised learning where the similarity metric between image samples is the Wasserstein distance. This metric is used in the label propagation mechanism during learning. We apply and demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on a GNSS real life application. More specifically, we address the problem of multi-path interference detection. Experiments are conducted under various signal conditions. The results show that for specific choices of hyperparameters controlling the amount of semi-supervision and the level of sensitivity to the metric, the classification accuracy can be significantly improved over the fully supervised training method.

Title: Measurement-based Initial Point Smoothing and Control Approach to Quantum Memory Systems
Authors: Igor G. Vladimirov, Ian R. Petersen, Guodong Shi
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a quantum memory system for storing quantum information in the form of its initial dynamic variables in the presence of environmental noise. In order to compensate for the deviation from the initial conditions, the classical parameters of the system Hamiltonian are affected by the actuator output of a measurement-based classical controller. The latter uses an observation process produced by a measuring apparatus from the quantum output field of the memory system. The underlying system is modelled as an open quantum harmonic oscillator whose Heisenberg evolution is governed by linear Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum stochastic differential equations. The controller is organised as a classical linear time-varying system, so that the resulting closed-loop system has quantum and classical dynamic variables. We apply linear-quadratic-Gaussian control and fixed-point smoothing at the level of the first two moments and consider controllers with a separation structure which involve a continuously updated estimate for the initial quantum variables. The initial-point smoother is used for actuator signal formation so as to minimise the sum of a mean-square deviation of the quantum memory system variables at a given time horizon from their initial values and an integral quadratic penalty on the control signal.

Title: The T12 System for AudioMOS Challenge 2025: Audio Aesthetics Score Prediction System Using KAN- and VERSA-based Models
Authors: Katsuhiko Yamamoto, Koichi Miyazaki, Shogo Seki
Abstract: We propose an audio aesthetics score (AES) prediction system by CyberAgent (AESCA) for AudioMOS Challenge 2025 (AMC25) Track 2. The AESCA comprises a Kolmogorov--Arnold Network (KAN)-based audiobox aesthetics and a predictor from the metric scores using the VERSA toolkit. In the KAN-based predictor, we replaced each multi-layer perceptron layer in the baseline model with a group-rational KAN and trained the model with labeled and pseudo-labeled audio samples. The VERSA-based predictor was designed as a regression model using extreme gradient boosting, incorporating outputs from existing metrics. Both the KAN- and VERSA-based models predicted the AES, including the four evaluation axes. The final AES values were calculated using an ensemble model that combined four KAN-based models and a VERSA-based model. Our proposed T12 system yielded the best correlations among the submitted systems, in three axes at the utterance level, two axes at the system level, and the overall average.

Title: Executing Discrete/Continuous Declarative Process Specifications via Complex Event Processing
Authors: Stefan Schönig, Leo Poss, Fabrizio Maria Maggi
Abstract: Traditional Business Process Management (BPM) focuses on discrete events and fails to incorporate critical continuous sensor data in cyber-physical environments. Hybrid declarative specifications, utilizing Signal Temporal Logic (STL), address this limitation by allowing constraints over both discrete events and real-valued signals. However, existing work has been limited to monitoring and post-hoc conformance checking. This paper introduces a novel Complex Event Processing (CEP)-based execution architecture that enables the real-time execution and enforcement of hybrid declarative models. Our three-layer approach integrates STL-inspired predicates into the execution flow, allowing the system to actively trigger activities and enforce process boundaries based on continuous sensor behavior. This approach bridges the gap between hybrid specification and operational control.

Title: Scenario-aware Uncertainty Quantification for Trajectory Prediction with Statistical Guarantees
Authors: Yiming Shu, Jiahui Xu, Linghuan Kong, Fangni Zhang, Guodong Yin, Chen Sun
Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification in trajectory prediction is crucial for safety-critical autonomous driving systems, yet existing deep learning predictors lack uncertainty-aware frameworks adaptable to heterogeneous real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel scenario-aware uncertainty quantification framework to provide the predicted trajectories with prediction intervals and reliability assessment. To begin with, predicted trajectories from the trained predictor and their ground truth are projected onto the map-derived reference routes within the Frenet coordinate system. We then employ CopulaCPTS as the conformal calibration method to generate temporal prediction intervals for distinct scenarios as the uncertainty measure. Building upon this, within the proposed trajectory reliability discriminator (TRD), mean error and calibrated confidence intervals are synergistically analyzed to establish reliability models for different scenarios. Subsequently, the risk-aware discriminator leverages a joint risk model that integrates longitudinal and lateral prediction intervals within the Frenet coordinate to identify critical points. This enables segmentation of trajectories into reliable and unreliable segments, holding the advantage of informing downstream planning modules with actionable reliability results. We evaluated our framework using the real-world nuPlan dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in scenario-aware uncertainty quantification and reliability assessment across diverse driving contexts.

Title: Bayesian Active Inference for Intelligent UAV Anti-Jamming and Adaptive Trajectory Planning
Authors: Ali Krayani, Seyedeh Fatemeh Sadati, Lucio Marcenaro, Carlo Regazzoni
Abstract: This paper proposes a hierarchical trajectory planning framework for UAVs operating under adversarial jamming conditions. Leveraging Bayesian Active Inference, the approach combines expert-generated demonstrations with probabilistic generative modeling to encode high-level symbolic planning, low-level motion policies, and wireless signal feedback. During deployment, the UAV performs online inference to anticipate interference, localize jammers, and adapt its trajectory accordingly, without prior knowledge of jammer locations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves near-expert performance, significantly reducing communication interference and mission cost compared to model-free reinforcement learning baselines, while maintaining robust generalization in dynamic environments.

Title: Modified global finite-time quasi-continuous second-order robust feedback control
Authors: Michael Ruderman, Denis Efimov
Abstract: A non-overshooting quasi-continuous sliding mode control with sub-optimal damping was recently introduced in Ruderman and Efimov (2025) for perturbed second-order systems. The present work proposes an essential modification of the nonlinear control law which (i) allows for a parameterizable control amplitude limitation in a large subset of the initial values, (ii) admits an entire state-space R2 (that was not given in Ruderman and Efimov (2025)) for the finite-time control, and finally (iii) enables for the found analytic solution of the state trajectories in the unperturbed case. The latter allows also for an exact estimation of the finite convergence time, and open an avenue for other potentially interesting analysis of the control properties in the future. For a perturbed case, the solution-based and Lyapunov function-based approaches are developed to show the uniform global asymptotic stability. The proposed robustness and convergence analysis are accompanied by several illustrative numerical examples.

Title: Global stability of vehicle-with-driver dynamics via Sum-of-Squares programming
Authors: Martino Gulisano, Marco Gabiccini
Abstract: This work estimates safe invariant subsets of the Region of Attraction (ROA) for a seven-state vehicle-with-driver system, capturing both asymptotic stability and the influence of state-safety bounds along the system trajectory. Safe sets are computed by optimizing Lyapunov functions through an original iterative Sum-of-Squares (SOS) procedure. The method is first demonstrated on a two-state benchmark, where it accurately recovers a prescribed safe region as the 1-level set of a polynomial Lyapunov function. We then describe the distinguishing characteristics of the studied vehicle-with-driver system: the control dynamics mimic human driver behavior through a delayed preview-tracking model that, with suitable parameter choices, can also emulate digital controllers. To enable SOS optimization, a polynomial approximation of the nonlinear vehicle model is derived, together with its operating-envelope constraints. The framework is then applied to understeering and oversteering scenarios, and the estimated safe sets are compared with reference boundaries obtained from exhaustive simulations. The results show that SOS techniques can efficiently deliver Lyapunov-defined safe regions, supporting their potential use for real-time safety assessment, for example as a supervisory layer for active vehicle control.

Title: Numerically Reliable Brunovsky Transformations
Authors: Shaohui Yang, Colin N. Jones
Abstract: The Brunovsky canonical form provides sparse structural representations that are beneficial for computational optimal control, yet existing methods fail to compute it reliably. We propose a technique that produces Brunovsky transformations with substantially lower construction errors and improved conditioning. A controllable linear system is first reduced to staircase form via an orthogonal similarity transformation. We then derive a simple linear parametrization of the transformations yielding the unique Brunovsky form. Numerical stability is further enhanced by applying a deadbeat gain before computing system matrix powers and by optimizing the linear parameters to minimize condition numbers.

Title: LDLT $\mathcal{L}$-Lipschitz Network: Generalized Deep End-To-End Lipschitz Network Construction
Authors: Marius F.R. Juston, Ramavarapu S. Sreenivas, Dustin Nottage, Ahmet Soylemezoglu
Abstract: Deep residual networks (ResNets) have demonstrated outstanding success in computer vision tasks, attributed to their ability to maintain gradient flow through deep architectures. Simultaneously, controlling the Lipschitz constant in neural networks has emerged as an essential area of research to enhance adversarial robustness and network certifiability. This paper presents a rigorous approach to the general design of $\mathcal{L}$-Lipschitz deep residual networks using a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) framework. Initially, the ResNet architecture was reformulated as a cyclic tridiagonal LMI, and closed-form constraints on network parameters were derived to ensure $\mathcal{L}$-Lipschitz continuity; however, using a new $LDL^\top$ decomposition approach for certifying LMI feasibility, we extend the construction of $\mathcal{L}$-Lipchitz networks to any other nonlinear architecture. Our contributions include a provable parameterization methodology for constructing Lipschitz-constrained residual networks and other hierarchical architectures. Cholesky decomposition is also used for efficient parameterization. These findings enable robust network designs applicable to adversarial robustness, certified training, and control systems. The $LDL^\top$ formulation is shown to be a tight relaxation of the SDP-based network, maintaining full expressiveness and achieving 3\%-13\% accuracy gains over SLL Layers on 121 UCI data sets.

Title: Subtransmission Grid Control via Online Feedback Optimization
Authors: Lukas Ortmann, Jean Maeght, Patrick Panciatici, Florian Dörfler, Saverio Bolognani
Abstract: The increasing electric power consumption and the shift towards renewable energy resources demand for new ways to operate transmission and subtransmission grids. Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) is a feedback real-time control method that can be employed to enable optimal operation of these grids. Such controllers can maximize grid efficiency (e.g., minimizing curtailment) while satisfying grid constraints like voltage and current limits. The OFO control method is tailored and extended to handle discrete inputs and it is explained how to design an OFO controller for the subtransmission grid. A novel benchmark is presented and published that corresponds to the real French subtransmission grid on which the proposed controller is analyzed in terms of robustness against model mismatch, constraint satisfaction, and tracking performance. It is shown that OFO controllers can help utilize the grid to its full extent, virtually reinforce it, and operate it optimally and in real-time by using the flexibility offered by renewable generators connected to distribution grids.

Title: Inertia-Constrained Generation Scheduling: Sample Selection, Learning-Embedded Optimization Modeling, and Computational Enhancement
Authors: Mingjian Tuo, Fan Jiang, Xingpeng Li, Pascal Van Hentenryck
Abstract: Day-ahead generation scheduling is typically conducted by solv-ing security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) problem. However, with fast-growing of inverter-based resources, grid inertia has been dramatically reduced, compromising the dy-namic stability system. Traditional SCUC (T-SCUC), without any inertia requirements, may no longer be effective for renewa-bles-dominated grids. To address this, we propose the active linearized sparse neural network-embedded SCUC (ALSNN-SCUC) model, utilizing machine learning (ML) to incorporate system dynamic performance. A multi-output deep neural net-work (DNN) model is trained offline on strategically-selected data samples to accurately predict frequency stability metrics: locational RoCoF and frequency nadir. Structured sparsity and active ReLU linearization are implemented to prune redundant DNN neurons, significantly reducing its size while ensuring pre-diction accuracy even at high sparsity levels. By embedding this ML-based frequency stability predictor into SCUC as con-straints, the proposed ALSNN-SCUC model minimizes its com-putational complexity while ensuring frequency stability follow-ing G-1 contingency. Case studies show that the proposed ALSNN-SCUC can enforce pre-specified frequency requirements without being overly conservative, outperforming five bench-mark models including T-SCUC, two physics-based SCUC, and two ML-based SCUC. The proposed sparsification and active linearization strategies can reduce the DNN-SCUC computing time by over 95% for both IEEE 24-bus and 118-bus systems, demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed ALSNN-SCUC model.

Title: Optimal Power Scheduling for High Renewables-Integrated Energy Systems with Battery Storage
Authors: Cunzhi Zhao, Xingpeng Li
Abstract: In high renewables-integrated power systems, irrespective to their sizes, energy storage is commonly included and utilized to mitigate fluctuations from both the load and renewable power generation, ensuring system reliability, among which battery energy storage system (BESS) are experiencing fast-growth in recent years. The BESS systems, predominantly employing lithi-um-ion batteries, have been extensively deployed. The degrada-tion of these batteries significantly affects system efficiency. Deep neural networks can accurately quantify the battery degrada-tion; however, the model complexity hinders their applications in energy scheduling for various power systems at different scales. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel approach, in-troducing a linearized sparse neural network-based battery deg-radation model (SNNBD), specifically tailored to quantify battery degradation based on the scheduled BESS operational profiles. This approach achieves accurate degradation prediction while substantially reducing the complexity associated with a dense neural network model. The computational burden of day-ahead energy scheduling when integrating battery degradation can thus be substantially alleviated. Case studies, conducted on both small-scale microgrids and large-scale bulk power grids, demonstrated the efficiency and suitability of the proposed optimal energy scheduling model that can effectively address battery degrada-tion concerns while optimizing day-ahead energy scheduling op-erations.

Title: Convergent Primal-Dual Plug-and-Play Image Restoration: A General Algorithm and Applications
Authors: Yodai Suzuki, Ryosuke Isono, Shunsuke Ono
Abstract: We propose a general deep plug-and-play (PnP) algorithm with a theoretical convergence guarantee. PnP strategies have demonstrated outstanding performance in various image restoration tasks by exploiting the powerful priors underlying Gaussian denoisers. However, existing PnP methods often lack theoretical convergence guarantees under realistic assumptions due to their ad-hoc nature, resulting in inconsistent behavior. Moreover, even when convergence guarantees are provided, they are typically designed for specific settings or require a considerable computational cost in handling non-quadratic data-fidelity terms and additional constraints, which are key components in many image restoration scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we integrate the PnP paradigm with primal-dual splitting (PDS), an efficient proximal splitting methodology for solving a wide range of convex optimization problems, and develop a general convergent PnP framework. Specifically, we establish theoretical conditions for the convergence of the proposed PnP algorithm under a reasonable assumption. Furthermore, we show that the problem solved by the proposed PnP algorithm is not a standard convex optimization problem but a more general monotone inclusion problem, where we provide a mathematical representation of the solution set. Our approach efficiently handles a broad class of image restoration problems with guaranteed theoretical convergence. Numerical experiments on specific image restoration tasks validate the practicality and effectiveness of our theoretical results.

Title: Levelised Cost of Demand Response: Estimating the Cost-Competitiveness of Flexible Demand
Authors: Jacob Thrän, Tim C. Green, Robert Shorten
Abstract: To make well-informed investment decisions, energy system stakeholders require reliable cost frameworks for demand response (DR) and storage technologies. While the levelised cost of storage (LCOS) permits comprehensive cost comparisons between different storage technologies, no generic cost measure for the comparison of different DR schemes exists. This paper introduces the levelised cost of demand response (LCODR) which is an analogous measure to the LCOS but crucially differs from it by considering consumer reward payments. Additionally, the value factor from cost estimations of variable renewable energy is adapted to account for the variable availability of DR. The LCODRs for four direct load control (DLC) schemes and twelve storage applications are estimated and contrasted against LCOS literature values for the most competitive storage technologies. The DLC schemes are vehicle-to-grid, smart charging, smart heat pumps, and heat pumps with thermal storage. The results show that only heat pumps with thermal storage consistently outcompete storage technologies with EV-based DR schemes being competitive for some applications. The results and the underlying methodology offer a tool for energy system stakeholders to assess the competitiveness of DR schemes even with limited user data.

Title: A Multi-Objective Simultaneous Routing, Facility Location and Allocation Model for Earthquake Emergency Logistics
Authors: Sakineh Khodadadi, Tohid Kargar Tasooji, Afshin Shariat-Mohayman, Navid Kalantari
Abstract: Emergency preparedness reduces the severity and impact of major disasters. In the case of earthquakes, a rapid and efficient emergency response is essential to reduce the number of fatalities. Therefore, the design and planning of an adequate emergency transportation network are crucial in earthquake-prone locations. In the context of emergency transportation modeling, the aim of emergency routing is to find the network with the minimum length that can provide access between the maximum number of Emergency Response Centers (ERCs) and damaged areas. Meanwhile, the goal of the facility location and allocation problem is to optimize the placement of temporary hospitals to increase coverage and accessibility, particularly in remote or severely impacted areas. This paper proposes a multi-objective, robust, multi-modal, and multi-time-period optimization problem that simultaneously optimizes routing, facility location, and hospital allocation. The objective function is to minimize unmet commodity demand, unserved injuries, and economic costs. We adopt a fuzzy goal programming approach to solve the multi-objective simultaneous routing, facility location, and allocation model.

Title: Design and Analysis of a Robust Control System for Triple Inverted Pendulum Stabilization
Authors: Tohid Kargar Tasooji, Sakineh Khodadadi
Abstract: The design of robust controllers for triple inverted pendulum systems presents significant challenges due to their inherent instability and nonlinear dynamics. Furthermore, uncertainties in system parameters further complicate the control design. This paper investigates a robust control strategy for triple inverted pendulums under parameter uncertainty. Two control approaches, namely the $H_\infty$ controller and the $\mu$-synthesis controller, are compared in terms of their ability to achieve reference tracking and disturbance rejection. Simulation results demonstrate that the $H_\infty$ controller provides superior transient performance, making it a promising solution for the robust stabilization of such complex systems.

Title: A robot-assisted pipeline to rapidly scan 1.7 million historical aerial photographs
Authors: Sheila Masson, Alan Potts, Allan Williams, Steve Berggreen, Kevin McLaren, Sam Martin, Eugenio Noda, Nicklas Nordfors, Nic Ruecroft, Hannah Druckenmiller, Solomon Hsiang, Andreas Madestam, Anna Tompsett
Abstract: During the 20th Century, aerial surveys captured hundreds of millions of high-resolution photographs of the earth's surface. These images, the precursors to modern satellite imagery, represent an extraordinary visual record of the environmental and social upheavals of the 20th Century. However, most of these images currently languish in physical archives where retrieval is difficult and costly. Digitization could revolutionize access, but manual scanning is slow and expensive. Automated scanning could make at-scale digitization feasible, unlocking this visual record of the 20th Century for the digital era. Here, we describe and validate a novel robot-assisted pipeline that increases worker productivity in scanning 30-fold, applied at scale to digitize an archive of 1.7 million historical aerial photographs from 65 countries.

Title: LymphAtlas- A Unified Multimodal Lymphoma Imaging Repository Delivering AI-Enhanced Diagnostic Insight
Authors: Jiajun Ding, Beiyao Zhu, Xiaosheng Liu, Lishen Zhang, Zhao Liu
Abstract: This study integrates PET metabolic information with CT anatomical structures to establish a 3D multimodal segmentation dataset for lymphoma based on whole-body FDG PET/CT examinations, which bridges the gap of the lack of standardised multimodal segmentation datasets in the field of haematological malignancies. We retrospectively collected 483 examination datasets acquired between March 2011 and May 2024, involving 220 patients (106 non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 42 Hodgkin lymphoma); all data underwent ethical review and were rigorously de-identified. Complete 3D structural information was preserved during data acquisition, preprocessing and annotation, and a high-quality dataset was constructed based on the nnUNet format. By systematic technical validation and evaluation of the preprocessing process, annotation quality and automatic segmentation algorithm, the deep learning model trained based on this dataset is verified to achieve accurate segmentation of lymphoma lesions in PET/CT images with high accuracy, good robustness and reproducibility, which proves the applicability and stability of this dataset in accurate segmentation and quantitative analysis. The deep fusion of PET/CT images achieved with this dataset not only significantly improves the accurate portrayal of the morphology, location and metabolic features of tumour lesions, but also provides solid data support for early diagnosis, clinical staging and personalized treatment, and promotes the development of automated image segmentation and precision medicine based on deep learning. The dataset and related resources are available at this https URL.

Title: OPTIKS: Optimized Gradient Properties Through Timing in K-Space
Authors: Matthew A. McCready, Xiaozhi Cao, Kawin Setsompop, John M. Pauly, Adam B. Kerr
Abstract: A customizable method (OPTIKS) for designing fast trajectory-constrained gradient waveforms with optimized time domain properties was developed. Given a specified multidimensional k-space trajectory, the method optimizes traversal speed (and therefore timing) with position along the trajectory. OPTIKS facilitates optimization of objectives dependent on the time domain gradient waveform and the arc-length domain k-space speed. OPTIKS is applied to design waveforms which limit peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), minimize mechanical resonance excitation, and reduce acoustic noise. A variety of trajectory examples are presented including spirals, circular echo-planar-imaging, and rosettes. Design performance is evaluated based on duration, standardized PNS models, field measurements, gradient coil back-EMF measurements, and calibrated acoustic measurements. We show reductions in back-EMF of up to 94% and field oscillations up to 91.1%, acoustic noise decreases of up to 9.22 dB, and with efficient use of PNS models speed increases of up to 11.4%. The design method implementation is made available as an open source Python package through GitHub.

Title: Luré-Postnikov Stability Analysis of Closed-Loop Control Systems with Gated Recurrent Neural Network-based Virtual Sensors
Authors: Eric Hilgert, Andreas Schwung
Abstract: This article addresses certification of closed-loop stability when a virtual-sensor based on a gated recurrent neural network operates in the feedback path of a nonlinear control system. The Hadamard gating used in standard GRU/LSTM cells is shown to violate the Luré-Postnikov Lyapunov conditions of absolute-stability theory, leading to conservative analysis. To overcome this limitation, a modified architecture-termed the Luré-Postnikov gated recurrent neural network (LP-GRNN)-is proposed; its affine update law is compatible with the Luré-Postnikov framework while matching the prediction accuracy of vanilla GRU/LSTM models on the NASA CMAPSS benchmark. Embedding the LP-GRNN, the plant, and a saturated PI controller in a unified standard nonlinear operator form (SNOF) reduces the stability problem to a compact set of tractable linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) whose feasibility certifies global asymptotic stability. A linearized boiler case study illustrates the workflow and validates the closed-loop performance, thereby bridging modern virtual-sensor design with formal stability guarantees.

Title: Stochastic Orthogonal Regularization for deep projective priors
Authors: Ali Joundi (UB), Yann Traonmilin (UB), Alasdair Newson (ISIR)
Abstract: Many crucial tasks of image processing and computer vision are formulated as inverse problems. Thus, it is of great importance to design fast and robust algorithms to solve these problems. In this paper, we focus on generalized projected gradient descent (GPGD) algorithms where generalized projections are realized with learned neural networks and provide state-of-the-art results for imaging inverse problems. Indeed, neural networks allow for projections onto unknown low-dimensional sets that model complex data, such as images. We call these projections deep projective priors. In generic settings, when the orthogonal projection onto a lowdimensional model set is used, it has been shown, under a restricted isometry assumption, that the corresponding orthogonal PGD converges with a linear rate, yielding near-optimal convergence (within the class of GPGD methods) in the classical case of sparse recovery. However, for deep projective priors trained with classical mean squared error losses, there is little guarantee that the hypotheses for linear convergence are satisfied. In this paper, we propose a stochastic orthogonal regularization of the training loss for deep projective priors. This regularization is motivated by our theoretical results: a sufficiently good approximation of the orthogonal projection guarantees linear stable recovery with performance close to orthogonal PGD. We show experimentally, using two different deep projective priors (based on autoencoders and on denoising networks), that our stochastic orthogonal regularization yields projections that improve convergence speed and robustness of GPGD in challenging inverse problem settings, in accordance with our theoretical findings.

Title: Spectral Derivatives
Authors: Pavel Komarov
Abstract: One of the happiest accidents in all math is the ease of transforming a function to and taking derivatives in the Fourier frequency domain. But in order to exploit this extraordinary fact without serious artefacting, and in order to be able to use a computer, we need quite a bit of extra knowledge and care. This document sets out the math behind the spectral-derivatives Python package. I touch on fundamental signal processing and calculus concepts as necessary and build upwards.

Title: Intelligent Metasurface-Enabled Integrated Sensing and Communication: Unified Framework and Key Technologies
Authors: Shunyu Li, Tianqi Mao, Guangyao Liu, Fan Zhang, Ruiqi Liu, Meng Hua, Zhen Gao, Qingqing Wu, George K. Karagiannidis
Abstract: As the demand for ubiquitous connectivity and high-precision environmental awareness grows, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a key technology for sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. Intelligent metasurfaces (IMs) have also been widely adopted in ISAC scenarios due to their efficient, programmable control over electromagnetic waves. This provides a versatile solution that meets the dual-function requirements of next-generation networks. Although reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been extensively studied for manipulating the propagation channel between base and mobile stations, the full potential of IMs in ISAC transceiver design remains under-explored. Against this backdrop, this article explores emerging IM-enabled transceiver designs for ISAC systems. It begins with an overview of representative IM architectures, their unique principles, and their inherent advantages in EM wave manipulation. Next, a unified ISAC framework is established to systematically model the design and derivation of diverse IM-enabled transceiver structures. This lays the foundation for performance optimization, trade-offs, and analysis. The paper then discusses several critical technologies for IM-enabled ISAC transceivers, including dedicated channel modeling, effective channel estimation, tailored beamforming strategies, and dual-functional waveform design.

Title: A multi-dynamic low-rank deep image prior (ML-DIP) for 3D real-time cardiovascular MRI
Authors: Chong Chen, Marc Vornehm, Zhenyu Bu, Preethi Chandrasekaran, Muhammad A. Sultan, Syed M. Arshad, Yingmin Liu, Yuchi Han, Rizwan Ahmad
Abstract: Purpose: To develop a reconstruction framework for 3D real-time cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) from highly undersampled data without requiring fully sampled training datasets. Methods: We developed a multi-dynamic low-rank deep image prior (ML-DIP) framework that models spatial image content and deformation fields using separate neural networks. These sub-networks are jointly trained per scan to reconstruct the dynamic image series directly from undersampled k-space data. ML-DIP was evaluated on (i) a 3D cine digital phantom with simulated premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), (ii) ten healthy subjects (including two scanned during both rest and exercise), and (iii) 12 patients with a history of PVCs. Phantom results were assessed using peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM). In vivo performance was evaluated by comparing left-ventricular function quantification (against 2D real-time cine) and image quality (against 2D real-time cine and binning-based 5D-Cine). Results: In the phantom study, ML-DIP achieved PSNR > 29 dB and SSIM > 0.90 for scan times as short as two minutes, while recovering cardiac motion, respiratory motion, and PVC events. In healthy subjects, ML-DIP yielded functional measurements comparable to 2D cine and higher image quality than 5D-Cine, including during exercise with high heart rates and bulk motion. In PVC patients, ML-DIP preserved beat-to-beat variability and reconstructed irregular beats, whereas 5D-Cine showed motion artifacts and information loss due to binning. Conclusion: ML-DIP enables high-quality 3D real-time CMR with acceleration factors exceeding 1,000 by learning low-rank spatial and motion representations from undersampled data, without relying on external fully sampled training datasets.

Title: Stabilization of Age-Structured Competing Populations
Authors: Carina Veil, Miroslav Krstić, Patrick McNamee, Oliver Sawodny
Abstract: Age-structured models capture the dynamic behavior of populations over time and result in nonlinear integro-partial differential equations (IPDEs). These processes arise in various fields such as biotechnology, economics, or demography. While coupled age-structured IPDEs modeling two or more interacting species occur naturally in epidemiology and ecology, they remain relatively underexplored. Prior work has primarily addressed stable and marginally stable dynamics. In constrast, this work considers an exponentially unstable model of two competing predator populations, formally referred to in the literature as ``competition'' dynamics. If one were to apply an input that simultaneously harvests both predator species, one would have control over only the product of the densities of the species, not over their ratio. Therefore, it is necessary to design a control input that directly harvests only one of the two predator species, while indirectly influencing the other via a backstepping approach. The model is transformed into a system of two coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), of which only one is actuated, and two autonomous, exponentially stable integral delay equations (IDEs) which enter the ODEs as nonlinear disturbances. The ODEs are globally stabilized with backstepping and an estimate of the region of attraction of the asymptotically stabilized equilibrium of the full IPDE system is provided, under a positivity restriction on control. Additionally, the full IPDE system is also shown to be local exponential stable. Such generalizations of competition dynamics open exciting possibilities for future research directions for systems with more than two species.

Title: Generation Expansion Planning with Upstream Supply Chain Constraints on Materials, Manufacturing, and Deployment
Authors: Boyu Yao, Andrey Bernstein, Yury Dvorkin
Abstract: Rising electricity demand underscores the need for secure and reliable generation expansion planning that accounts for upstream supply chain constraints. Traditional models often overlook limitations in materials, manufacturing capacity, lead times for deployment, and field availability, which can delay availability of planned resources and thus to threaten system reliability. This paper introduces a multi-stage supply chain-constrained generation expansion planning (SC-GEP) model that optimizes long-term investments while capturing material availability, production limits, spatial and temporal constraints, and material reuse from retired assets. A decomposition algorithm efficiently solves the resulting MILP. A Maryland case study shows that supply chain constraints shift technology choices, amplify deployment delays caused by lead times, and prompt earlier investment in shorter lead-time, low-material-intensity options. In the low-demand scenario, supply chain constraints raise investment costs by $1.2 billion. Under high demand, persistent generation and reserve shortfalls emerge, underscoring the need to integrate upstream constraints into long-term planning.

Title: Radio over Fiber with Cascaded Structure: Algorithm for Uplink Positioning
Authors: Dexin Kong, Diana Pamela Moya Osorio, Erik G. Larsson
Abstract: Recent advancements in polymer microwave fiber (PMF) technology have created significant opportunities for robust, low-cost, and high-speed sub-terahertz (THz) radio-over-fiber communications. Recognizing these potential benefits, this paper explores a novel radio-over-fiber (RoF) structure that interconnects multiple radio units (RUs) in cascade via fiber, envisioning its application in indoor scenarios. This structure creates a number of research opportunities when considering cascaded distortion effects introduced by non-linear power amplifiers (PAs) at the RUs and the propagation channel over the fiber. We propose maximum-likelihood and non-linear least-squares algorithms to estimate the propagation distance along the RoF and the time-of-arrival between the RoF and the user equipment. For the case of linear PAs, we derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound to benchmark the performance of the estimators. Finally, we investigate the use of the system for uplink positioning. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed estimators perform satisfactorily even with the cascaded effects of non-linear PAs, and that the deployment of this RoF structure can enable new cost-effective opportunities for high-resolution positioning in indoor scenarios. In the numerical evaluation, we also use measured PMF characteristics for high-density polyethylene fibers.

Title: Computing Sound and Accurate Upper and Lower Bounds on Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Value Functions
Authors: Ihab Tabbara, Eliya Badr, Hussein Sibai
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a fundamental tool for safety verification and control synthesis for nonlinear-control systems. Classical HJ reachability analysis methods discretize the continuous state space and solve the HJ partial differential equation over a grid, but these approaches do not account for discretization errors and can under-approximate backward reachable sets, which represent unsafe sets of states. We present a framework for computing sound upper and lower bounds on the HJ value functions via value iteration over grids. Additionally, we develop a refinement algorithm that splits cells that were not possible to classify as safe or unsafe given the computed bounds. This algorithm enables computing accurate over-approximations of backward reachable sets even when starting from coarse grids. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our method in two case studies.

Title: Generative MR Multitasking with complex-harmonic cardiac encoding: Bridging the gap between gated imaging and real-time imaging
Authors: Xinguo Fang, Anthony G. Christodoulou
Abstract: Purpose: To develop a unified image reconstruction framework that bridges real-time and gated cardiac MRI, including quantitative MRI. Methods: We introduce Generative Multitasking, which learns an implicit neural temporal basis from sequence timings and an interpretable latent space for cardiac and respiratory motion. Cardiac motion is modeled as a complex harmonic, with phase encoding timing and a latent amplitude capturing beat-to-beat functional variability, linking cardiac phase-resolved ("gated-like") and time-resolved ("real-time-like") views. We implemented the framework using a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) and evaluated it for free-breathing, non-ECG-gated radial GRE in three settings: steady-state cine imaging, multicontrast T2prep/IR imaging, and dual-flip-angle T1/T2 mapping, compared with conventional Multitasking. Results: Generative Multitasking provided flexible cardiac motion representation, enabling reconstruction of archetypal cardiac phase-resolved cines (like gating) as well as time-resolved series that reveal beat-to-beat variability (like real-time imaging). Conditioning on the previous k-space angle and modifying this term at inference removed eddy-current artifacts without globally smoothing high temporal frequencies. For quantitative mapping, Generative Multitasking reduced intraseptal T1 and T2 coefficients of variation compared with conventional Multitasking (T1: 0.13 vs. 0.31; T2: 0.12 vs. 0.32; p<0.001), indicating higher SNR. Conclusion: Generative Multitasking uses a CVAE with complex harmonic cardiac coordinates to unify gated and real-time CMR within a single free-breathing, non-ECG-gated acquisition. It allows flexible cardiac motion representation, suppresses trajectory-dependent artifacts, and improves T1 and T2 mapping, suggesting a path toward cine, multicontrast, and quantitative imaging without separate gated and real-time scans.

Title: A Fractional Variational Approach to Spectral Filtering Using the Fourier Transform
Authors: Nelson H. T. Lemes, José Claudinei Ferreira, Higor V. M. Ferreira
Abstract: The interference of fluorescence signals and noise remains a significant challenge in Raman spectrum analysis, often obscuring subtle spectral features that are critical for accurate analysis. Inspired by variational methods similar to those used in image denoising, our approach minimizes a functional involving fractional derivatives to balance noise suppression with the preservation of essential chemical features of the signal, such as peak position, intensity, and area. The original problem is reformulated in the frequency domain through the Fourier transform, making the implementation simple and fast. In this work, we discuss the theoretical framework, practical implementation, and the advantages and limitations of this method in the context of {simulated} Raman data, as well as in image processing. The main contribution of this article is the combination of a variational approach in the frequency domain, the use of fractional derivatives, and the optimization of the {regularization parameter and} derivative order through the concept of Shannon entropy. This work explores how the fractional order, combined with the regularization parameter, affects noise removal and preserves the essential features of the spectrum {and image}. Finally, the study shows that the combination of the proposed strategies produces an efficient, robust, and easily implementable filter.

Title: Communication-Aware Dissipative Control for Networks of Heterogeneous Nonlinear Agents
Authors: Ingyu Jang, Leila J. Bridgeman
Abstract: Communication-aware control is essential to reduce costs and complexity in large-scale networks. However, it is challenging to simultaneously determine a sparse communication topology and achieve high performance and robustness. This work achieves all three objectives through dissipativity-based, sparsity-promoting controller synthesis. The approach identifies an optimal sparse structure using either weighted l1 penalties or alternating direction methods of multipliers (ADMM) with a cardinality term, and iteratively solves a convexified version of the NP hard structured optimal control problem. The proposed methods are demonstrated on heterogeneous networks with uncertain and unstable agents.

Title: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Empowered Task Offloading in V2I Networks
Authors: Xinyu You, Haojie Yan, Yuedong Xu, Lifeng Wang, Liangui Dai
Abstract: Edge computing plays an essential role in the vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) networks, where vehicles offload their intensive computation tasks to the road-side units for saving energy and reduce the latency. This paper designs the optimal task offloading policy to address the concerns involving processing delay, energy consumption and edge computing cost. Each computation task consisting of some interdependent sub-tasks is characterized as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In such dynamic networks, a novel hierarchical Offloading scheme is proposed by leveraging deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The inter-dependencies among the DAGs of the computation tasks are extracted using a graph neural network with attention mechanism. A parameterized DRL algorithm is developed to deal with the hierarchical action space containing both discrete and continuous actions. Simulation results with a real-world car speed dataset demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the system overhead.

Title: Semantic Communication and Control Co-Design for Multi-Objective Distinct Dynamics
Authors: Abanoub M. Girgis, Hyowoon Seo, Mehdi Bennis
Abstract: This letter introduces a machine-learning approach to learning the semantic dynamics of correlated systems with different control rules and dynamics. By leveraging the Koopman operator in an autoencoder (AE) framework, the system's state evolution is linearized in the latent space using a dynamic semantic Koopman (DSK) model, capturing the baseline semantic dynamics. Signal temporal logic (STL) is incorporated through a logical semantic Koopman (LSK) model to encode system-specific control rules. These models form the proposed logical Koopman AE framework that reduces communication costs while improving state prediction accuracy and control performance, showing a 91.65% reduction in communication samples and significant performance gains in simulation.

Title: Wavehax: Aliasing-Free Neural Waveform Synthesis Based on 2D Convolution and Harmonic Prior for Reliable Complex Spectrogram Estimation
Authors: Reo Yoneyama, Atsushi Miyashita, Ryuichi Yamamoto, Tomoki Toda
Abstract: Neural vocoders often struggle with aliasing in latent feature spaces, caused by time-domain nonlinear operations and resampling layers. Aliasing folds high-frequency components into the low-frequency range, making aliased and original frequency components indistinguishable and introducing two practical issues. First, aliasing complicates the waveform generation process, as the subsequent layers must address these aliasing effects, increasing the computational complexity. Second, it limits extrapolation performance, particularly in handling high fundamental frequencies, which degrades the perceptual quality of generated speech waveforms. This paper demonstrates that 1) time-domain nonlinear operations inevitably introduce aliasing but provide a strong inductive bias for harmonic generation, and 2) time-frequency-domain processing can achieve aliasing-free waveform synthesis but lacks the inductive bias for effective harmonic generation. Building on this insight, we propose Wavehax, an aliasing-free neural WAVEform generator that integrates 2D convolution and a HArmonic prior for reliable Complex Spectrogram estimation. Experimental results show that Wavehax achieves speech quality comparable to existing high-fidelity neural vocoders and exhibits exceptional robustness in scenarios requiring high fundamental frequency extrapolation, where aliasing effects become typically severe. Moreover, Wavehax requires less than 5% of the multiply-accumulate operations and model parameters compared to HiFi-GAN V1, while achieving over four times faster CPU inference speed.

Title: Generative Diffusion Model Driven Massive Random Access in Massive MIMO Systems
Authors: Keke Ying, Zhen Gao, Sheng Chen, Tony Q.S. Quek, H. Vincent Poor
Abstract: Massive random access is an important technology for achieving ultra-massive connectivity in next-generation wireless communication systems. It aims to address key challenges during the initial access phase, including active user detection (AUD), channel estimation (CE), and data detection (DD). This paper examines massive access in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where deep learning is used to tackle the challenging AUD, CE, and DD functions. First, we introduce a Transformer-AUD scheme tailored for variable pilot-length access. This approach integrates pilot length information and a spatial correlation module into a Transformer-based detector, enabling a single model to generalize across various pilot lengths and antenna numbers. Next, we propose a generative diffusion model (GDM)-driven iterative CE and DD framework. The GDM employs a score function to capture the posterior distributions of massive MIMO channels and data symbols. Part of the score function is learned from the channel dataset via neural networks, while the remaining score component is derived in a closed form by applying the symbol prior constellation distribution and known transmission model. Utilizing these posterior scores, we design an asynchronous alternating CE and DD framework that employs a predictor-corrector sampling technique to iteratively generate channel estimation and data detection results during the reverse diffusion process. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approaches significantly outperform baseline methods with respect to AUD, CE, and DD.

Title: A Strong View-Free Baseline Approach for Single-View Image Guided Point Cloud Completion
Authors: Fangzhou Lin, Zilin Dai, Rigved Sanku, Songlin Hou, Kazunori D Yamada, Haichong K. Zhang, Ziming Zhang
Abstract: The single-view image guided point cloud completion (SVIPC) task aims to reconstruct a complete point cloud from a partial input with the help of a single-view image. While previous works have demonstrated the effectiveness of this multimodal approach, the fundamental necessity of image guidance remains largely unexamined. To explore this, we propose a strong baseline approach for SVIPC based on an attention-based multi-branch encoder-decoder network that only takes partial point clouds as input, view-free. Our hierarchical self-fusion mechanism, driven by cross-attention and self-attention layers, effectively integrates information across multiple streams, enriching feature representations and strengthening the networks ability to capture geometric structures. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the ShapeNet-ViPC dataset demonstrate that our view-free framework performs superiorly to state-of-the-art SVIPC methods. We hope our findings provide new insights into the development of multimodal learning in SVIPC. Our demo code will be available at this https URL.

Title: REINA: Regularized Entropy Information-Based Loss for Efficient Simultaneous Speech Translation
Authors: Nameer Hirschkind, Joseph Liu, Xiao Yu, Mahesh Kumar Nandwana
Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) systems stream in audio while simultaneously emitting translated text or speech. Such systems face the significant challenge of balancing translation quality and latency. We introduce a strategy to optimize this tradeoff: wait for more input only if you gain information by doing so. Based on this strategy, we present Regularized Entropy INformation Adaptation (REINA), a novel loss to train an adaptive policy using an existing non-streaming translation model. We derive REINA from information theory principles and show that REINA helps push the reported Pareto frontier of the latency/quality tradeoff over prior works. Utilizing REINA, we train a SimulST model on French, Spanish and German, both from and into English. Training on only open source or synthetically generated data, we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) streaming results for models of comparable size. We also introduce a metric for streaming efficiency, quantitatively showing REINA improves the latency/quality trade-off by as much as 21% compared to prior approaches, normalized against non-streaming baseline BLEU scores.

Title: Spatiotemporal First-Arrival Modeling and Parameter Estimation in Drift-Diffusion Molecular Channels
Authors: Yun-Feng Lo, Yen-Chi Lee
Abstract: We derive a closed-form joint distribution of the first arrival time (FAT) and first arrival position (FAP) in drift-diffusion molecular communication (MC) channels. In contrast to prior studies that analyze FAT or FAP in isolation, our framework explicitly captures the spatiotemporal coupling inherent in multidimensional transport. Building on this derivation, we compute the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and demonstrate that estimation accuracy for diffusivity scales proportionally with the spatial dimension, enabling increased sensitivity in higher-dimensional environments. Furthermore, we show that lateral drift -- which is unobservable from timing data alone -- can be recovered via a closed-form Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) with a simple physical interpretation. Leveraging this spatial degree of freedom, we propose Drift Shift Keying (DSK), proving that joint receivers can reliably detect signals that are undetectable to timing-only receivers due to identical marginal FAT distributions. These results highlight the significant potential of spatiotemporal processing for future nanoscale communication and sensing.

Title: Bayesian Insights into Exchange and Restriction in Gray Matter Diffusion MRI
Authors: Maëliss Jallais, Quentin Uhl, Tommaso Pavan, Malwina Molendowska, Derek K. Jones, Ileana Jelescu, Marco Palombo
Abstract: Biophysical models in diffusion MRI (dMRI) hold promise for characterizing gray matter tissue microstructure. Yet, the reliability of their parameter estimates remains largely under-studied, especially in models that incorporate water exchange. In this study, we investigate the accuracy, precision, and presence of degeneracy of two recently proposed gray matter models, NEXI and SANDIX, using established acquisition protocols, on both simulated and \textit{in vivo} data. We employ $\mu$GUIDE, a Bayesian inference framework based on deep learning, to quantify parameter uncertainty and detect degeneracies, enabling a more interpretable assessment of model fits. Our results show that while some microstructural parameters, such as extra-cellular diffusivity and neurite signal fraction, are robustly estimated, others, including exchange time and soma radius, are often associated with high uncertainty and estimation bias, particularly under realistic noise conditions and reduced acquisition protocols. Comparison with non-linear least squares fitting highlights the critical advantage of uncertainty-aware methods: the ability to flag and filter out unreliable estimates. Together, these findings emphasize the need to report uncertainty and account for model degeneracies when interpreting model-based estimates. Our study advocates for the integration of probabilistic fitting approaches into imaging pipelines to improve reproducibility and biological interpretability.

Title: Yours or Mine? Overwriting Attacks Against Neural Audio Watermarking
Authors: Lingfeng Yao, Chenpei Huang, Shengyao Wang, Junpei Xue, Hanqing Guo, Jiang Liu, Phone Lin, Tomoaki Ohtsuki, Miao Pan
Abstract: As generative audio models are rapidly evolving, AI-generated audios increasingly raise concerns about copyright infringement and misinformation spread. Audio watermarking, as a proactive defense, can embed secret messages into audio for copyright protection and source verification. However, current neural audio watermarking methods focus primarily on the imperceptibility and robustness of watermarking, while ignoring its vulnerability to security attacks. In this paper, we develop a simple yet powerful attack: the overwriting attack that overwrites the legitimate audio watermark with a forged one and makes the original legitimate watermark undetectable. Based on the audio watermarking information that the adversary has, we propose three categories of overwriting attacks, i.e., white-box, gray-box, and black-box attacks. We also thoroughly evaluate the proposed attacks on state-of-the-art neural audio watermarking methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed overwriting attacks can effectively compromise existing watermarking schemes across various settings and achieve a nearly 100% attack success rate. The practicality and effectiveness of the proposed overwriting attacks expose security flaws in existing neural audio watermarking systems, underscoring the need to enhance security in future audio watermarking designs.

Title: Data-Augmented Deep Learning for Downhole Depth Sensing and Field Validation
Authors: Siyu Xiao, Xindi Zhao, Tianhao Mao, Yiwei Wang, Yuqiao Chen, Hongyun Zhang, Jian Wang, Junjie Wang, Shuang Liu, Tupei Chen, Yang Liu
Abstract: Accurate downhole depth measurement is essential for oil and gas well operations, directly influencing reservoir contact, production efficiency, and operational safety. Collar correlation using a casing collar locator (CCL) is fundamental for precise depth calibration. While neural network-based CCL signal recognition has achieved significant progress in collar identification, preprocessing methods for such applications remain underdeveloped. Moreover, the limited availability of real well data poses substantial challenges for training neural network models that require extensive datasets. This paper presents a system integrated into downhole tools for CCL signal acquisition to facilitate dataset construction. We propose comprehensive preprocessing methods for data augmentation and evaluate their effectiveness using our neural network models. Through systematic experimentation across various configuration combinations, we analyze the contribution of each augmentation method. Results demonstrate that standardization, label distribution smoothing (LDS), and random cropping are fundamental requirements for model training, while label smoothing regularization (LSR), time scaling, and multiple sampling significantly enhance model generalization capability. The F1 scores of our two benchmark models trained with the proposed augmentation methods maximumly improve from 0.937 and 0.952 to 1.0 and 1.0, respectively. Performance validation on real CCL waveforms confirms the effectiveness and practical applicability of our approach. This work addresses the gaps in data augmentation methodologies for training casing collar recognition models in CCL data-limited environments.

Title: SONIC: Supersizing Motion Tracking for Natural Humanoid Whole-Body Control

Abstract: Despite the rise of billion-parameter foundation models trained across thousands of GPUs, similar scaling gains have not been shown for humanoid control. Current neural controllers for humanoids remain modest in size, target a limited set of behaviors, and are trained on a handful of GPUs over several days. We show that scaling up model capacity, data, and compute yields a generalist humanoid controller capable of creating natural and robust whole-body movements. Specifically, we posit motion tracking as a natural and scalable task for humanoid control, leveraging dense supervision from diverse motion-capture data to acquire human motion priors without manual reward engineering. We build a foundation model for motion tracking by scaling along three axes: network size (from 1.2M to 42M parameters), dataset volume (over 100M frames, 700 hours of high-quality motion data), and compute (9k GPU hours). Beyond demonstrating the benefits of scale, we show the practical utility of our model through two mechanisms: (1) a real-time universal kinematic planner that bridges motion tracking to downstream task execution, enabling natural and interactive control, and (2) a unified token space that supports various motion input interfaces, such as VR teleoperation devices, human videos, and vision-language-action (VLA) models, all using the same policy. Scaling motion tracking exhibits favorable properties: performance improves steadily with increased compute and data diversity, and learned representations generalize to unseen motions, establishing motion tracking at scale as a practical foundation for humanoid control.

Title: Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Nash Equilibrium Seeking with Heterogeneous Data: A Lagrangian Approach
Authors: Zifan Wang, Georgios Pantazis, Sergio Grammatico, Michael M. Zavlanos, Karl H. Johansson
Abstract: We study a class of distributionally robust games where agents are allowed to heterogeneously choose their risk aversion with respect to distributional shifts of the uncertainty. In our formulation, heterogeneous Wasserstein ball constraints on each distribution are enforced through a penalty function leveraging a Lagrangian formulation. We then formulate the distributionally robust Nash equilibrium problem and show that under certain assumptions it is equivalent to a finite-dimensional variational inequality problem with a strongly monotone mapping. We then design an approximate Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm and prove convergence of the average regret to a quantity that diminishes with the number of iterations, thus learning the desired equilibrium up to an a priori specified accuracy. Numerical simulations corroborate our theoretical findings.

Title: Accelerated ADMM: Automated Parameter Tuning and Improved Linear Convergence
Authors: Meisam Tavakoli, Fabian Jakob, Guido Carnevale, Giuseppe Notarstefano, Andrea Iannelli
Abstract: This work studies the linear convergence of an accelerated scheme of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for strongly convex and Lipschitz-smooth problems. We use the methodology of expressing the accelerated ADMM as a Lur'e system, i.e., an interconnection of a linear dynamical system in feedback with a slope-restricted operator, and we use Integral Quadratic Constraints to establish linear convergence. In addition, we propose several parameter tuning heuristics and their impact on the convergence rate through numerical analyses. Our new bounds show improved linear convergence rates compared to the vanilla algorithm and previous proposed accelerated variants, which is also empirically validated on a LASSO regression benchmark.

Title: Communicating Properties of Quantum States over Classical Noisy Channels
Authors: Nikhitha Nunavath, Jiechen Chen, Osvaldo Simeone, Riccardo Bassoli, Frank H. P. Fitzek
Abstract: Transmitting information about quantum states over classical noisy channels is an important problem with applications to science, computing, and sensing. This task, however, poses fundamental challenges due to the exponential scaling of state space with system size. We introduce shadow tomography-based transmission with unequal error protection (STT-UEP), a novel communication protocol that enables efficient transmission of properties of quantum states, allowing decoder-side estimation of arbitrary observables. Unlike conventional approaches requiring the transmission of a number of bits that is exponential in the number of qubits, STT-UEP achieves communication complexity that scales logarithmically with the number of observables, depending on the observable weight. The protocol exploits classical shadow tomography for measurement efficiency, and applies unequal error protection by encoding measurement bases with stronger channel codes than measurement outcomes. We provide theoretical guarantees on estimation accuracy as a function of the bit error probability of the classical channel, and validate the approach against several benchmarks via numerical results.
