Title: Understanding Human Daily Experience Through Continuous Sensing: ETRI Lifelog Dataset 2024
Authors: Se Won Oh, Hyuntae Jeong, Seungeun Chung, Jeong Mook Lim, Kyoung Ju Noh, Sunkyung Lee, Gyuwon Jung
Abstract: Improving human health and well-being requires an accurate and effective understanding of an individual's physical and mental state throughout daily life. To support this goal, we utilized smartphones, smartwatches, and sleep sensors to collect data passively and continuously for 24 hours a day, with minimal interference to participants' usual behavior, enabling us to gather quantitative data on daily behaviors and sleep activities across multiple days. Additionally, we gathered subjective self-reports of participants' fatigue, stress, and sleep quality through surveys conducted immediately before and after sleep. This comprehensive lifelog dataset is expected to provide a foundational resource for exploring meaningful insights into human daily life and lifestyle patterns, and a portion of the data has been anonymized and made publicly available for further research. In this paper, we introduce the ETRI Lifelog Dataset 2024, detailing its structure and presenting potential applications, such as using machine learning models to predict sleep quality and stress.

Title: Detection of Autonomic Dysreflexia in Individuals With Spinal Cord Injury Using Multimodal Wearable Sensors
Authors: Bertram Fuchs, Mehdi Ejtehadi, Ana Cisnal, JÃ¼rgen Pannek, Anke Scheel-Sailer, Robert Riener, Inge Eriks-Hoogland, Diego Paez-Granados
Abstract: Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by sudden, severe blood pressure (BP) spikes in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). Early, accurate detection is essential to prevent cardiovascular complications, yet current monitoring methods are either invasive or rely on subjective symptom reporting, limiting applicability in daily file. This study presents a non-invasive, explainable machine learning framework for detecting AD using multimodal wearable sensors. Data were collected from 27 individuals with chronic SCI during urodynamic studies, including electrocardiography (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), bioimpedance (BioZ), temperature, respiratory rate (RR), and heart rate (HR), across three commercial devices. Objective AD labels were derived from synchronized cuff-based BP measurements. Following signal preprocessing and feature extraction, BorutaSHAP was used for robust feature selection, and SHAP values for explainability. We trained modality- and device-specific weak learners and aggregated them using a stacked ensemble meta-model. Cross-validation was stratified by participants to ensure generalizability. HR- and ECG-derived features were identified as the most informative, particularly those capturing rhythm morphology and variability. The Nearest Centroid ensemble yielded the highest performance (Macro F1 = 0.77+/-0.03), significantly outperforming baseline models. Among modalities, HR achieved the highest area under the curve (AUC = 0.93), followed by ECG (0.88) and PPG (0.86). RR and temperature features contributed less to overall accuracy, consistent with missing data and low specificity. The model proved robust to sensor dropout and aligned well with clinical AD events. These results represent an important step toward personalized, real-time monitoring for individuals with SCI.

Title: Technical specification of a framework for the collection of clinical images and data
Authors: Alistair Mackenzie (1), Mark Halling-Brown (1), Ruben van Engen (2), Carlijn Roozemond (2), Lucy Warren (1), Dominic Ward (1), Nadia Smith (1) ((1) Royal Surrey NHS Foundation Trust, Guildford, UK, (2) Dutch Expert Centre for Screening (LRCB), Nijmegen, The Netherlands)
Abstract: In this report a framework for the collection of clinical images and data for use when training and validating artificial intelligence (AI) tools is described. The report contains not only information about the collection of the images and clinical data, but the ethics and information governance processes to consider ensuring the data is collected safely, and the infrastructure and agreements required to allow for the sharing of data with other groups. A key characteristic of the main collection framework described here is that it can enable automated and ongoing collection of datasets to ensure that the data is up-to-date and representative of current practice. This is important in the context of training and validating AI tools as it is vital that datasets have a mix of older cases with long term follow-up such that the clinical outcome is as accurate as possible, and current data. Validations run on old data will provide findings and conclusions relative to the status of the imaging units when that data was generated. It is important that a validation dataset can assess the AI tools with data that it would see if deployed and active now. Other types of collection frameworks, which do not follow a fully automated approach, are also described. Whilst the fully automated method is recommended for large scale, long-term image collection, there may be reasons to start data collection using semi-automated methods and indications of how to do that are provided.

Title: A Survey of Multimodal Ophthalmic Diagnostics: From Task-Specific Approaches to Foundational Models
Authors: Xiaoling Luo, Ruli Zheng, Qiaojian Zheng, Zibo Du, Shuo Yang, Meidan Ding, Qihao Xu, Chengliang Liu, Linlin Shen
Abstract: Visual impairment represents a major global health challenge, with multimodal imaging providing complementary information that is essential for accurate ophthalmic diagnosis. This comprehensive survey systematically reviews the latest advances in multimodal deep learning methods in ophthalmology up to the year 2025. The review focuses on two main categories: task-specific multimodal approaches and large-scale multimodal foundation models. Task-specific approaches are designed for particular clinical applications such as lesion detection, disease diagnosis, and image synthesis. These methods utilize a variety of imaging modalities including color fundus photography, optical coherence tomography, and angiography. On the other hand, foundation models combine sophisticated vision-language architectures and large language models pretrained on diverse ophthalmic datasets. These models enable robust cross-modal understanding, automated clinical report generation, and decision support. The survey critically examines important datasets, evaluation metrics, and methodological innovations including self-supervised learning, attention-based fusion, and contrastive alignment. It also discusses ongoing challenges such as variability in data, limited annotations, lack of interpretability, and issues with generalizability across different patient populations. Finally, the survey outlines promising future directions that emphasize the use of ultra-widefield imaging and reinforcement learning-based reasoning frameworks to create intelligent, interpretable, and clinically applicable AI systems for ophthalmology.

Title: Improve Retinal Artery/Vein Classification via Channel Couplin
Authors: Shuang Zeng, Chee Hong Lee, Kaiwen Li, Boxu Xie, Ourui Fu, Hangzhou He, Lei Zhu, Yanye Lu, Fangxiao Cheng
Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation plays a vital role in analyzing fundus images for the diagnosis of systemic and ocular diseases. Building on this, classifying segmented vessels into arteries and veins (A/V) further enables the extraction of clinically relevant features such as vessel width, diameter and tortuosity, which are essential for detecting conditions like diabetic and hypertensive retinopathy. However, manual segmentation and classification are time-consuming, costly and inconsistent. With the advancement of Convolutional Neural Networks, several automated methods have been proposed to address this challenge, but there are still some issues. For example, the existing methods all treat artery, vein and overall vessel segmentation as three separate binary tasks, neglecting the intrinsic coupling relationships between these anatomical structures. Considering artery and vein structures are subsets of the overall retinal vessel map and should naturally exhibit prediction consistency with it, we design a novel loss named Channel-Coupled Vessel Consistency Loss to enforce the coherence and consistency between vessel, artery and vein predictions, avoiding biasing the network toward three simple binary segmentation tasks. Moreover, we also introduce a regularization term named intra-image pixel-level contrastive loss to extract more discriminative feature-level fine-grained representations for accurate retinal A/V classification. SOTA results have been achieved across three public A/V classification datasets including RITE, LES-AV and HRF. Our code will be available upon acceptance.

Title: A Modified VGG19-Based Framework for Accurate and Interpretable Real-Time Bone Fracture Detection
Authors: Md. Ehsanul Haque, Abrar Fahim, Shamik Dey, Syoda Anamika Jahan, S. M. Jahidul Islam, Sakib Rokoni, Md Sakib Morshed
Abstract: Early and accurate detection of the bone fracture is paramount to initiating treatment as early as possible and avoiding any delay in patient treatment and outcomes. Interpretation of X-ray image is a time consuming and error prone task, especially when resources for such interpretation are limited by lack of radiology expertise. Additionally, deep learning approaches used currently, typically suffer from misclassifications and lack interpretable explanations to clinical use. In order to overcome these challenges, we propose an automated framework of bone fracture detection using a VGG-19 model modified to our needs. It incorporates sophisticated preprocessing techniques that include Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), Otsu's thresholding, and Canny edge detection, among others, to enhance image clarity as well as to facilitate the feature extraction. Therefore, we use Grad-CAM, an Explainable AI method that can generate visual heatmaps of the model's decision making process, as a type of model interpretability, for clinicians to understand the model's decision making process. It encourages trust and helps in further clinical validation. It is deployed in a real time web application, where healthcare professionals can upload X-ray images and get the diagnostic feedback within 0.5 seconds. The performance of our modified VGG-19 model attains 99.78\% classification accuracy and AUC score of 1.00, making it exceptionally good. The framework provides a reliable, fast, and interpretable solution for bone fracture detection that reasons more efficiently for diagnoses and better patient care.

Title: Boosting Vision Semantic Density with Anatomy Normality Modeling for Medical Vision-language Pre-training
Authors: Weiwei Cao, Jianpeng Zhang, Zhongyi Shui, Sinuo Wang, Zeli Chen, Xi Li, Le Lu, Xianghua Ye, Tingbo Liang, Qi Zhang, Ling Zhang
Abstract: Vision-language pre-training (VLP) has great potential for developing multifunctional and general medical diagnostic capabilities. However, aligning medical images with a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to reports with a high SNR presents a semantic density gap, leading to visual alignment bias. In this paper, we propose boosting vision semantic density to improve alignment effectiveness. On one hand, we enhance visual semantics through disease-level vision contrastive learning, which strengthens the model's ability to differentiate between normal and abnormal samples for each anatomical structure. On the other hand, we introduce an anatomical normality modeling method to model the distribution of normal samples for each anatomy, leveraging VQ-VAE for reconstructing normal vision embeddings in the latent space. This process amplifies abnormal signals by leveraging distribution shifts in abnormal samples, enhancing the model's perception and discrimination of abnormal attributes. The enhanced visual representation effectively captures the diagnostic-relevant semantics, facilitating more efficient and accurate alignment with the diagnostic report. We conduct extensive experiments on two chest CT datasets, CT-RATE and Rad-ChestCT, and an abdominal CT dataset, MedVL-CT69K, and comprehensively evaluate the diagnosis performance across multiple tasks in the chest and abdominal CT scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance. Notably, our method achieved an average AUC of 84.9% across 54 diseases in 15 organs, significantly surpassing existing methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the superior transfer learning capabilities of our pre-trained model. Code is available at this https URL.

Title: Do We Need Pre-Processing for Deep Learning Based Ultrasound Shear Wave Elastography?
Authors: Sarah Grube, SÃ¶ren GrÃ¼nhagen, Sarah Latus, Michael Meyling, Alexander Schlaefer
Abstract: Estimating the elasticity of soft tissue can provide useful information for various diagnostic applications. Ultrasound shear wave elastography offers a non-invasive approach. However, its generalizability and standardization across different systems and processing pipelines remain limited. Considering the influence of image processing on ultrasound based diagnostics, recent literature has discussed the impact of different image processing steps on reliable and reproducible elasticity analysis. In this work, we investigate the need of ultrasound pre-processing steps for deep learning-based ultrasound shear wave elastography. We evaluate the performance of a 3D convolutional neural network in predicting shear wave velocities from spatio-temporal ultrasound images, studying different degrees of pre-processing on the input images, ranging from fully beamformed and filtered ultrasound images to raw radiofrequency data. We compare the predictions from our deep learning approach to a conventional time-of-flight method across four gelatin phantoms with different elasticity levels. Our results demonstrate statistically significant differences in the predicted shear wave velocity among all elasticity groups, regardless of the degree of pre-processing. Although pre-processing slightly improves performance metrics, our results show that the deep learning approach can reliably differentiate between elasticity groups using raw, unprocessed radiofrequency data. These results show that deep learning-based approaches could reduce the need for and the bias of traditional ultrasound pre-processing steps in ultrasound shear wave elastography, enabling faster and more reliable clinical elasticity assessments.

Title: M$^3$HL: Mutual Mask Mix with High-Low Level Feature Consistency for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Yajun Liu, Zenghui Zhang, Jiang Yue, Weiwei Guo, Dongying Li
Abstract: Data augmentation methods inspired by CutMix have demonstrated significant potential in recent semi-supervised medical image segmentation tasks. However, these approaches often apply CutMix operations in a rigid and inflexible manner, while paying insufficient attention to feature-level consistency constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Mutual Mask Mix with High-Low level feature consistency (M$^3$HL) to address the aforementioned challenges, which consists of two key components: 1) M$^3$: An enhanced data augmentation operation inspired by the masking strategy from Masked Image Modeling (MIM), which advances conventional CutMix through dynamically adjustable masks to generate spatially complementary image pairs for collaborative training, thereby enabling effective information fusion between labeled and unlabeled images. 2) HL: A hierarchical consistency regularization framework that enforces high-level and low-level feature consistency between unlabeled and mixed images, enabling the model to better capture discriminative feature this http URL method achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely adopted medical image segmentation benchmarks including the ACDC and LA datasets.

Title: Classification non supervis{Ã©}es d'acquisitions hyperspectrales cod{Ã©}es : quelles v{Ã©}rit{Ã©}s terrain ?
Authors: Trung-tin Dinh (IRAP, LAAS-PHOTO, UT3, LAAS), HervÃ© Carfantan (IRAP), Antoine Monmayrant (LAAS-PHOTO), Simon Lacroix (LAAS-RIS)
Abstract: We propose an unsupervised classification method using a limited number of coded acquisitions from a DD-CASSI hyperspectral imager. Based on a simple model of intra-class spectral variability, this approach allow to identify classes and estimate reference spectra, despite data compression by a factor of ten. Here, we highlight the limitations of the ground truths commonly used to evaluate this type of method: lack of a clear definition of the notion of class, high intra-class variability, and even classification errors. Using the Pavia University scene, we show that with simple assumptions, it is possible to detect regions that are spectrally more coherent, highlighting the need to rethink the evaluation of classification methods, particularly in unsupervised scenarios.

Title: FUTransUNet-GradCAM: A Hybrid Transformer-U-Net with Self-Attention and Explainable Visualizations for Foot Ulcer Segmentation
Authors: Akwasi Asare, Mary Sagoe, Justice Williams Asare
Abstract: Automated segmentation of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis, therapeutic planning, and longitudinal wound monitoring. However, this task remains challenging due to the heterogeneous appearance, irregular morphology, and complex backgrounds associated with ulcer regions in clinical photographs. Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as U-Net, provide strong localization capabilities but struggle to model long-range spatial dependencies due to their inherently limited receptive fields. To address this, we propose FUTransUNet, a hybrid architecture that integrates the global attention mechanism of Vision Transformers (ViTs) into the U-Net framework. This combination allows the model to extract global contextual features while maintaining fine-grained spatial resolution through skip connections and an effective decoding pathway. We trained and validated FUTransUNet on the public Foot Ulcer Segmentation Challenge (FUSeg) dataset. FUTransUNet achieved a training Dice Coefficient of 0.8679, an IoU of 0.7672, and a training loss of 0.0053. On the validation set, the model achieved a Dice Coefficient of 0.8751, an IoU of 0.7780, and a validation loss of 0.009045. To ensure clinical transparency, we employed Grad-CAM visualizations, which highlighted model focus areas during prediction. These quantitative outcomes clearly demonstrate that our hybrid approach successfully integrates global and local feature extraction paradigms, thereby offering a highly robust, accurate, explainable, and interpretable solution and clinically translatable solution for automated foot ulcer analysis. The approach offers a reliable, high-fidelity solution for DFU segmentation, with implications for improving real-world wound assessment and patient care.

Title: Assessing the Impact of Image Super Resolution on White Blood Cell Classification Accuracy
Authors: Tatwadarshi P. Nagarhalli, Shruti S. Pawar, Soham A. Dahanukar, Uday Aswalekar, Ashwini M. Save, Sanket D. Patil
Abstract: Accurately classifying white blood cells from microscopic images is essential to identify several illnesses and conditions in medical diagnostics. Many deep learning technologies are being employed to quickly and automatically classify images. However, most of the time, the resolution of these microscopic pictures is quite low, which might make it difficult to classify them correctly. Some picture improvement techniques, such as image super-resolution, are being utilized to improve the resolution of the photos to get around this issue. The suggested study uses large image dimension upscaling to investigate how picture-enhancing approaches affect classification performance. The study specifically looks at how deep learning models may be able to understand more complex visual information by capturing subtler morphological changes when image resolution is increased using cutting-edge techniques. The model may learn from standard and augmented data since the improved images are incorporated into the training process. This dual method seeks to comprehend the impact of image resolution on model performance and enhance classification accuracy. A well-known model for picture categorization is used to conduct extensive testing and thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of this approach. This research intends to create more efficient image identification algorithms customized to a particular dataset of white blood cells by understanding the trade-offs between ordinary and enhanced images.

Title: Scaling Artificial Intelligence for Prostate Cancer Detection on MRI towards Population-Based Screening and Primary Diagnosis in a Global, Multiethnic Population (Study Protocol)
Authors: Anindo Saha, Joeran S. Bosma, Jasper J. Twilt, Alexander B.C.D. Ng, Aqua Asif, Kirti Magudia, Peder Larson, Qinglin Xie, Xiaodong Zhang, Chi Pham Minh, Samuel N. Gitau, Ivo G.

Padhani, Hashim U. Ahmed, Tobias NordstrÃ¶m, Martin Eklund, Veeru Kasivisvanathan, Maarten de Rooij, Henkjan Huisman (on behalf of the PI-CAI, ProCAncer-I, COMFORT, STHLM3-MRI and PRIME consortia)
Abstract: In this intercontinental, confirmatory study, we include a retrospective cohort of 22,481 MRI examinations (21,288 patients; 46 cities in 22 countries) to train and externally validate the PI-CAI-2B model, i.e., an efficient, next-generation iteration of the state-of-the-art AI system that was developed for detecting Gleason grade group $\geq$2 prostate cancer on MRI during the PI-CAI study. Of these examinations, 20,471 cases (19,278 patients; 26 cities in 14 countries) from two EU Horizon projects (ProCAncer-I, COMFORT) and 12 independent centers based in Europe, North America, Asia and Africa, are used for training and internal testing. Additionally, 2010 cases (2010 patients; 20 external cities in 12 countries) from population-based screening (STHLM3-MRI, IP1-PROSTAGRAM trials) and primary diagnostic settings (PRIME trial) based in Europe, North and South Americas, Asia and Australia, are used for external testing. Primary endpoint is the proportion of AI-based assessments in agreement with the standard of care diagnoses (i.e., clinical assessments made by expert uropathologists on histopathology, if available, or at least two expert urogenital radiologists in consensus; with access to patient history and peer consultation) in the detection of Gleason grade group $\geq$2 prostate cancer within the external testing cohorts. Our statistical analysis plan is prespecified with a hypothesis of diagnostic interchangeability to the standard of care at the PI-RADS $\geq$3 (primary diagnosis) or $\geq$4 (screening) cut-off, considering an absolute margin of 0.05 and reader estimates derived from the PI-CAI observer study (62 radiologists reading 400 cases). Secondary measures comprise the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of the AI system stratified by imaging quality, patient age and patient ethnicity to identify underlying biases (if any).

Title: When Deep Learning Fails: Limitations of Recurrent Models on Stroke-Based Handwriting for Alzheimer's Disease Detection
Authors: Emanuele Nardone, Tiziana D'Alessandro, Francesco Fontanella, Claudio De Stefano
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease detection requires expensive neuroimaging or invasive procedures, limiting accessibility. This study explores whether deep learning can enable non-invasive Alzheimer's disease detection through handwriting analysis. Using a dataset of 34 distinct handwriting tasks collected from healthy controls and Alzheimer's disease patients, we evaluate and compare three recurrent neural architectures (LSTM, GRU, RNN) against traditional machine learning models. A crucial distinction of our approach is that the recurrent models process pre-extracted features from discrete strokes, not raw temporal signals. This violates the assumption of a continuous temporal flow that recurrent networks are designed to capture. Results reveal that they exhibit poor specificity and high variance. Traditional ensemble methods significantly outperform all deep architectures, achieving higher accuracy with balanced metrics. This demonstrates that recurrent architectures, designed for continuous temporal sequences, fail when applied to feature vectors extracted from ambiguously segmented strokes. Despite their complexity, deep learning models cannot overcome the fundamental disconnect between their architectural assumptions and the discrete, feature-based nature of stroke-level handwriting data. Although performance is limited, the study highlights several critical issues in data representation and model compatibility, pointing to valuable directions for future research.

Title: Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM
Authors: Saif Khan Mohammed, Saurabh Prakash, Muhammad Ubadah, Imran Ali Khan, Ronny Hadani, Shlomo Rakib, Shachar Kons, Yoav Hebron, Ananthanarayanan Chockalingam, Robert Calderbank
Abstract: Zak-Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (Zak-OTFS) modulation has been shown to achieve significantly better performance compared to the standardized Cyclic-Prefix Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (CP-OFDM), in high delay/Doppler spread scenarios envisaged in next generation communication systems. Zak-OTFS carriers are quasi-periodic pulses in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, characterized by two parameters, (i) the pulse period along the delay axis (``delay period") (Doppler period is related to the delay period), and (ii) the pulse shaping filter. An important practical challenge is enabling support for Zak-OTFS modulation in existing CP-OFDM based modems. In this paper we show that Zak-OTFS modulation with pulse shaping constrained to sinc filtering (filter bandwidth equal to the communication bandwidth $B$) followed by time-windowing with a rectangular window of duration $(T + T_{cp})$ ($T$ is the symbol duration and $T_{cp}$ is the CP duration), can be implemented as a low-complexity precoder over standard CP-OFDM. We also show that the Zak-OTFS de-modulator with matched filtering constrained to sinc filtering (filter bandwidth $B$) followed by rectangular time windowing over duration $T$ can be implemented as a low-complexity post-processing of the CP-OFDM de-modulator output. This proposed ``Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM" architecture enables us to harness the benefits of Zak-OTFS in existing network infrastructure. We also show that the proposed Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM is a family of modulations, with CP-OFDM being a special case when the delay period takes its minimum possible value equal to the inverse bandwidth, i.e., Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM with minimum delay period.

Title: LCS-CTC: Leveraging Soft Alignments to Enhance Phonetic Transcription Robustness
Authors: Zongli Ye, Jiachen Lian, Akshaj Gupta, Xuanru Zhou, Krish Patel, Haodong Li, Hwi Joo Park, Chenxu Guo, Shuhe Li, Sam Wang, Cheol Jun Cho, Zoe Ezzes, Jet M.J. Vonk, Brittany T. Morin, Rian Bogley, Lisa Wauters, Zachary A. Miller, Maria Luisa Gorno-Tempini, Gopala Anumanchipalli
Abstract: Phonetic speech transcription is crucial for fine-grained linguistic analysis and downstream speech applications. While Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) is a widely used approach for such tasks due to its efficiency, it often falls short in recognition performance, especially under unclear and nonfluent speech. In this work, we propose LCS-CTC, a two-stage framework for phoneme-level speech recognition that combines a similarity-aware local alignment algorithm with a constrained CTC training objective. By predicting fine-grained frame-phoneme cost matrices and applying a modified Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm, our method identifies high-confidence alignment zones which are used to constrain the CTC decoding path space, thereby reducing overfitting and improving generalization ability, which enables both robust recognition and text-free forced alignment. Experiments on both LibriSpeech and PPA demonstrate that LCS-CTC consistently outperforms vanilla CTC baselines, suggesting its potential to unify phoneme modeling across fluent and non-fluent speech.

Title: UNISELF: A Unified Network with Instance Normalization and Self-Ensembled Lesion Fusion for Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation
Authors: Jinwei Zhang, Lianrui Zuo, Blake E. Dewey, Samuel W. Remedios, Yihao Liu, Savannah P. Hays, Dzung L. Pham, Ellen M. Mowry, Scott D. Newsome, Peter A. Calabresi, Aaron Carass, Jerry L. Prince
Abstract: Automated segmentation of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions using multicontrast magnetic resonance (MR) images improves efficiency and reproducibility compared to manual delineation, with deep learning (DL) methods achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, these DL-based methods have yet to simultaneously optimize in-domain accuracy and out-of-domain generalization when trained on a single source with limited data, or their performance has been unsatisfactory. To fill this gap, we propose a method called UNISELF, which achieves high accuracy within a single training domain while demonstrating strong generalizability across multiple out-of-domain test datasets. UNISELF employs a novel test-time self-ensembled lesion fusion to improve segmentation accuracy, and leverages test-time instance normalization (TTIN) of latent features to address domain shifts and missing input contrasts. Trained on the ISBI 2015 longitudinal MS segmentation challenge training dataset, UNISELF ranks among the best-performing methods on the challenge test dataset. Additionally, UNISELF outperforms all benchmark methods trained on the same ISBI training data across diverse out-of-domain test datasets with domain shifts and missing contrasts, including the public MICCAI 2016 and UMCL datasets, as well as a private multisite dataset. These test datasets exhibit domain shifts and/or missing contrasts caused by variations in acquisition protocols, scanner types, and imaging artifacts arising from imperfect acquisition.

Title: Optimal Interference Exploitation Waveform Design with Relaxed Block-Level Power Constraints
Authors: Xiao Tong, Lei Lei, Ang Li, A. Lee Swindlehurst, Symeon Chatzinotas
Abstract: This paper investigates constructive interference (CI)-based waveform design for phase shift keying and quadrature amplitude modulation symbols under relaxed block-level power constraints in multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MIMO) communication systems. Existing linear CI-based precoding methods, including symbol-level precoding (SLP) and block-level precoding (BLP), suffer from performance limitations due to strict symbol-level power budgets or insufficient degrees of freedom over the block. To overcome these challenges, we propose a nonlinear waveform optimization framework that introduces additional optimization variables and maximizes the minimum CI metric across the transmission block. The optimal waveform is derived in closed form using the function and Karush Kuhn Tucker conditions, and the solution is explicitly expressed with respect to the dual variables. Moreover, the original problems are equivalently reformulated as tractable quadratic programming (QP) problems. To efficiently solve the derived QP problems, we develop an improved alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm by integrating a linear-time projection technique, which significantly enhances the computational efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms substantially outperform the conventional CI-SLP and CI-BLP approaches, particularly under high-order modulations and large block lengths.

Title: PET2Rep: Towards Vision-Language Model-Drived Automated Radiology Report Generation for Positron Emission Tomography
Authors: Yichi Zhang, Wenbo Zhang, Zehui Ling, Gang Feng, Sisi Peng, Deshu Chen, Yuchen Liu, Hongwei Zhang, Shuqi Wang, Lanlan Li, Limei Han, Yuan Cheng, Zixin Hu, Yuan Qi, Le Xue
Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a cornerstone of modern oncologic and neurologic imaging, distinguished by its unique ability to illuminate dynamic metabolic processes that transcend the anatomical focus of traditional imaging technologies. Radiology reports are essential for clinical decision making, yet their manual creation is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recent advancements of vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential in medical applications, presenting a promising avenue for automating report generation. However, existing applications of VLMs in the medical domain have predominantly focused on structural imaging modalities, while the unique characteristics of molecular PET imaging have largely been overlooked. To bridge the gap, we introduce PET2Rep, a large-scale comprehensive benchmark for evaluation of general and medical VLMs for radiology report generation for PET images. PET2Rep stands out as the first dedicated dataset for PET report generation with metabolic information, uniquely capturing whole-body image-report pairs that cover dozens of organs to fill the critical gap in existing benchmarks and mirror real-world clinical comprehensiveness. In addition to widely recognized natural language generation metrics, we introduce a series of clinical efficiency metrics to evaluate the quality of radiotracer uptake pattern description in key organs in generated reports. We conduct a head-to-head comparison of 30 cutting-edge general-purpose and medical-specialized VLMs. The results show that the current state-of-the-art VLMs perform poorly on PET report generation task, falling considerably short of fulfilling practical needs. Moreover, we identify several key insufficiency that need to be addressed to advance the development in medical applications.

Title: WiFo-CF: Wireless Foundation Model for CSI Feedback
Authors: Liu Xuanyu, Gao Shijian, Liu Boxun, Cheng Xiang, Yang Liuqing
Abstract: Deep learning-based channel state information (CSI) feedback schemes demonstrate strong compression capabilities but are typically constrained to fixed system configurations, limiting their generalization and flexibility. To address this challenge, WiFo-CF, a novel wireless foundation model tailored for CSI feedback, is proposed, uniquely accommodating heterogeneous configurations such as varying channel dimensions, feedback rates, and data distributions within a unified framework through its key innovations: (1) a multi-user, multi-rate self-supervised pre-training strategy; and (2) a Mixture of Shared and Routed Expert (S-R MoE) architecture. Supporting the large-scale pre-training of WiFo-CF is the first heterogeneous channel feedback dataset, whose diverse patterns enable the model to achieve superior performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data across simulated and real-world scenarios. Furthermore, the learned representations effectively facilitate adaptation to downstream tasks such as CSI-based indoor localization, validating WiFo-CF's scalability and deployment potential.

Title: DFT-s-OFDM with Chirp Modulation
Authors: Yujie Liu, Yong Liang Guan, David GonzÃ¡lez G., Halim Yanikomeroglu
Abstract: In this paper, a new waveform called discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with chirp modulation (DFT-s-OFDM-CM) is proposed for the next generation of wireless communications. The information bits are conveyed by not only Q-ary constellation symbols but also the starting frequency of chirp signal. It could maintain the benefits provided by the chirped discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM), e.g., low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), full frequency diversity exploitation, etc. Simulation results confirm that the proposed DFT-s-OFDM-CM could achieve higher spectral efficiency while keeping the similar bit error rate (BER) to that of chirped DFT-s-OFDM. In addition, when maintaining the same spectral efficiency, the proposed DFT-s-OFDM-CM with the splitting of information bits into two streams enables the use of lower-order constellation modulation and offers greater resilience to noise, resulting in a lower BER than the chirped DFT-s-OFDM.

Title: Neuro-MoBRE: Exploring Multi-subject Multi-task Intracranial Decoding via Explicit Heterogeneity Resolving
Authors: Di Wu, Yifei Jia, Siyuan Li, Shiqi Zhao, Jie Yang, Mohamad Sawan
Abstract: Neurophysiological decoding, fundamental to advancing brain-computer interface (BCI) technologies, has significantly benefited from recent advances in deep learning. However, existing decoding approaches largely remain constrained to single-task scenarios and individual subjects, limiting their broader applicability and generalizability. Efforts towards creating large-scale neurophysiological foundation models have shown promise, but continue to struggle with significant challenges due to pervasive data heterogeneity across subjects and decoding tasks. Simply increasing model parameters and dataset size without explicitly addressing this heterogeneity fails to replicate the scaling successes seen in natural language processing. Here, we introduce the Neural Mixture of Brain Regional Experts (Neuro-MoBRE), a general-purpose decoding framework explicitly designed to manage the ubiquitous data heterogeneity in neurophysiological modeling. Neuro-MoBRE incorporates a brain-regional-temporal embedding mechanism combined with a mixture-of-experts approach, assigning neural signals from distinct brain regions to specialized regional experts on a unified embedding basis, thus explicitly resolving both structural and functional heterogeneity. Additionally, our region-masked autoencoding pre-training strategy further enhances representational consistency among subjects, complemented by a task-disentangled information aggregation method tailored to effectively handle task-specific neural variations. Evaluations conducted on intracranial recordings from 11 subjects across five diverse tasks, including complex language decoding and epileptic seizure diagnosis, demonstrate that Neuro-MoBRE surpasses prior art and exhibits robust generalization for zero-shot decoding on unseen subjects.

Title: Parallel GPT: Harmonizing the Independence and Interdependence of Acoustic and Semantic Information for Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech
Authors: Jingyuan Xing, Zhipeng Li, Jialong Mai, Xiaofen Xing, Xiangmin Xu
Abstract: Advances in speech representation and large language models have enhanced zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) performance. However, existing zero-shot TTS models face challenges in capturing the complex correlations between acoustic and semantic features, resulting in a lack of expressiveness and similarity. The primary reason lies in the complex relationship between semantic and acoustic features, which manifests independent and interdependent this http URL paper introduces a TTS framework that combines both autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) modules to harmonize the independence and interdependence of acoustic and semantic information. The AR model leverages the proposed Parallel Tokenizer to synthesize the top semantic and acoustic tokens simultaneously. In contrast, considering the interdependence, the Coupled NAR model predicts detailed tokens based on the general AR model's output. Parallel GPT, built on this architecture, is designed to improve zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis through its parallel structure. Experiments on English and Chinese datasets demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms the quality and efficiency of the synthesis of existing zero-shot TTS models.

Title: Multilingual Source Tracing of Speech Deepfakes: A First Benchmark
Authors: Xi Xuan, Yang Xiao, Rohan Kumar Das, Tomi Kinnunen
Abstract: Recent progress in generative AI has made it increasingly easy to create natural-sounding deepfake speech from just a few seconds of audio. While these tools support helpful applications, they also raise serious concerns by making it possible to generate convincing fake speech in many languages. Current research has largely focused on detecting fake speech, but little attention has been given to tracing the source models used to generate it. This paper introduces the first benchmark for multilingual speech deepfake source tracing, covering both mono- and cross-lingual scenarios. We comparatively investigate DSP- and SSL-based modeling; examine how SSL representations fine-tuned on different languages impact cross-lingual generalization performance; and evaluate generalization to unseen languages and speakers. Our findings offer the first comprehensive insights into the challenges of identifying speech generation models when training and inference languages differ. The dataset, protocol and code are available at this https URL.

Title: Dual-Function Radar-Communication Beamforming with Outage Probability Metric
Authors: Hossein Maleki, Carles Diaz-Vilor, Ali Pezeshki, Vahid Tarokh, Hamid Jafarkhani
Abstract: The integrated design of communication and sensing may offer a potential solution to address spectrum congestion. In this work, we develop a beamforming method for a dual-function radar-communication system, where the transmit signal is used for both radar surveillance and communication with multiple downlink users, despite imperfect channel state information (CSI). We focus on two scenarios of interest: radar-centric and communication-centric. In the radar-centric scenario, the primary goal is to optimize radar performance while attaining acceptable communication performance. To this end, we minimize a weighted sum of the mean-squared error in achieving a desired beampattern and a mean-squared cross correlation of the radar returns from directions of interest (DOI). We also seek to ensure that the probability of outage for the communication users remains below a desired threshold. In the communication-centric scenario, our main objective is to minimize the maximum probability of outage among the communication users while keeping the aforementioned radar metrics below a desired threshold. Both optimization problems are stochastic and untractable. We first take advantage of central limit theorem to obtain deterministic non-convex problems and then consider relaxations of these problems in the form of semidefinite programs with rank-1 constraints. We provide numerical experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed designs.

Title: Subspace Fitting Approach for Wideband Near-Field Localization
Authors: Ruiyun Zhang, Zhaolin Wang, Zhiqing Wei, Yuanwei Liu, Zehui Xiong, Zhiyong Feng
Abstract: Two subspace fitting approaches are proposed for wideband near-field localization. Unlike in conventional far-field systems, where distance and angle can be estimated separately, spherical wave propagation in near-field systems couples these parameters. We therefore derive a frequency-domain near-field signal model for multi-target wideband systems and develop a subspace fitting-based MUSIC method that jointly estimates distance and angle. To reduce complexity, a Fresnel approximation MUSIC algorithm is further introduced to decouple the distance and angle parameters. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of both proposed approaches.

Title: Agentic-AI based Mathematical Framework for Commercialization of Energy Resilience in Electrical Distribution System Planning and Operation
Authors: Aniket Johri, Divyanshi Dwivedi, Mayukha Pal
Abstract: The increasing vulnerability of electrical distribution systems to extreme weather events and cyber threats necessitates the development of economically viable frameworks for resilience enhancement. While existing approaches focus primarily on technical resilience metrics and enhancement strategies, there remains a significant gap in establishing market-driven mechanisms that can effectively commercialize resilience features while optimizing their deployment through intelligent decision-making. Moreover, traditional optimization approaches for distribution network reconfiguration often fail to dynamically adapt to both normal and emergency conditions. This paper introduces a novel framework integrating dual-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with market-based mechanisms, achieving an average resilience score of 0.85 0.08 over 10 test episodes. The proposed architecture leverages a dual-agent PPO scheme, where a strategic agent selects optimal DER-driven switching configurations, while a tactical agent fine-tunes individual switch states and grid preferences under budget and weather constraints. These agents interact within a custom-built dynamic simulation environment that models stochastic calamity events, budget limits, and resilience-cost trade-offs. A comprehensive reward function is designed that balances resilience enhancement objectives with market profitability (with up to 200x reward incentives, resulting in 85% of actions during calamity steps selecting configurations with 4 DERs), incorporating factors such as load recovery speed, system robustness, and customer satisfaction. Over 10 test episodes, the framework achieved a benefit-cost ratio of 0.12 0.01, demonstrating sustainable market incentives for resilience investment. This framework creates sustainable market incentives

Title: Simultaneous Information and Control Signalling Protocol for RIS-Empowered Wireless Systems
Authors: Evangelos Koutsonas, Xiaonan Mu, Nan Qi, Stylianos Trevlakis, Theodoros A. Tsiftsis, Alexandros-Apostolos A. Boulogeorgos
Abstract: Integration of RIS in radio access networks requires signaling between edge units and the RIS microcontroller (MC). Unfortunately, in several practical scenarios, the signaling latency is higher than the communication channel coherence time, which causes outdated signaling at the RIS. To counterbalance this, we introduce a simultaneous information and control signaling (SICS) protocol that enables operation adaptation through wireless control signal transmission. SICS assumes that the MC is equipped with a single antenna that operates at the same frequency as the RIS. RIS operates in simultaneous transmission and reflection (STAR) mode, and the source employs non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to superposition the information signal to the control signal. To maximize the achievable user data rate while ensuring the MC's ability to decode the control signal, we formulate and solve the corresponding optimization problem that returns RIS's reflection and transmission coefficients as well as the superposition coefficients of the NOMA scheme. Our results reveal the robustness of the SICS approach.

Title: Channel-Coherence-Adaptive Two-Stage Fully Digital Combining for mmWave MIMO Systems
Authors: Yasaman Khorsandmanesh, Emil BjÃ¶rnson, Joakim JaldÃ©n, Bengt Lindoff
Abstract: This paper considers a millimeter-wave wideband point-to-point MIMO system with fully digital transceivers at the base station and the user equipment (UE), focusing on mobile UE scenarios. A main challenge when building a digital UE combining is the large volume of baseband samples to handle. To mitigate computational and hardware complexity, we propose a novel two-stage digital combining scheme at the UE. The first stage reduces the $N_{\text{r}}$ received signals to $N_{\text{c}}$ streams before baseband processing, leveraging channel geometry for dimension reduction and updating at the beam coherence time, which is longer than the channel coherence time of the small-scale fading. By contrast, the second-stage combining is updated per fading realization. We develop a pilot-based channel estimation framework for this hardware setup based on maximum likelihoodestimation in both uplink and downlink. Digital precoding and combining designs are proposed, and a spectral efficiency expression that incorporates imperfect channel knowledge is derived. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms hybrid beamforming, showcasing the attractiveness of using two-stage fully digital transceivers in future systems.

Title: Near-Field Spatial non-Stationary Channel Estimation: Visibility-Region-HMM-Aided Polar-Domain Simultaneous OMP
Authors: Thibaut Ceulemans, Cel Thys, Robbert Beerten, Zhuangzhuang Cui, Sofie Pollin
Abstract: This work focuses on channel estimation in extremely large aperture array (ELAA) systems, where near-field propagation and spatial non-stationarity introduce complexities that hinder the effectiveness of traditional estimation techniques. A physics-based hybrid channel model is developed, incorporating non-binary visibility region (VR) masks to simulate diffraction-induced power variations across the antenna array. To address the estimation challenges posed by these channel conditions, a novel algorithm is proposed: Visibility-Region-HMM-Aided Polar-Domain Simultaneous Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (VR-HMM-P-SOMP). The method extends a greedy sparse recovery framework by integrating VR estimation through a hidden Markov model (HMM), using a novel emission formulation and Viterbi decoding. This allows the algorithm to adaptively mask steering vectors and account for spatial non-stationarity at the antenna level. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method enhances estimation accuracy compared to existing techniques, particularly in low-SNR and sparse scenarios, while maintaining a low computational complexity. The algorithm presents robustness across a range of design parameters and channel conditions, offering a practical solution for ELAA systems.

Title: Spectral Efficiency-Aware Codebook Design for Task-Oriented Semantic Communications
Authors: Anbang Zhang, Shuaishuai Guo, Chenyuan Feng, Shuai Liu, Hongyang Du, Geyong Min
Abstract: Digital task-oriented semantic communication (ToSC) aims to transmit only task-relevant information, significantly reducing communication overhead. Existing ToSC methods typically rely on learned codebooks to encode semantic features and map them to constellation symbols. However, these codebooks are often sparsely activated, resulting in low spectral efficiency and underutilization of channel capacity. This highlights a key challenge: how to design a codebook that not only supports task-specific inference but also approaches the theoretical limits of channel capacity. To address this challenge, we construct a spectral efficiency-aware codebook design framework that explicitly incorporates the codebook activation probability into the optimization process. Beyond maximizing task performance, we introduce the Wasserstein (WS) distance as a regularization metric to minimize the gap between the learned activation distribution and the optimal channel input distribution. Furthermore, we reinterpret WS theory from a generative perspective to align with the semantic nature of ToSC. Combining the above two aspects, we propose a WS-based adaptive hybrid distribution scheme, termed WS-DC, which learns compact, task-driven and channel-aware latent representations. Experimental results demonstrate that WS-DC not only outperforms existing approaches in inference accuracy but also significantly improves codebook efficiency, offering a promising direction toward capacity-approaching semantic communication systems.

Title: Towards interpretable emotion recognition: Identifying key features with machine learning
Authors: Yacouba Kaloga, Ina Kodrasi
Abstract: Unsupervised methods, such as wav2vec2 and HuBERT, have achieved state-of-the-art performance in audio tasks, leading to a shift away from research on interpretable features. However, the lack of interpretability in these methods limits their applicability in critical domains like medicine, where understanding feature relevance is crucial. To better understand the features of unsupervised models, it remains critical to identify the interpretable features relevant to a given task. In this work, we focus on emotion recognition and use machine learning algorithms to identify and generalize the most important interpretable features for this task. While previous studies have explored feature relevance in emotion recognition, they are often constrained by narrow contexts and present inconsistent findings. Our approach aims to overcome these limitations, providing a broader and more robust framework for identifying the most important interpretable features.

Title: ChineseEEG-2: An EEG Dataset for Multimodal Semantic Alignment and Neural Decoding during Reading and Listening
Authors: Sitong Chen, Beiqianyi Li, Cuilin He, Dongyang Li, Mingyang Wu, Xinke Shen, Song Wang, Xuetao Wei, Xindi Wang, Haiyan Wu, Quanying Liu
Abstract: EEG-based neural decoding requires large-scale benchmark datasets. Paired brain-language data across speaking, listening, and reading modalities are essential for aligning neural activity with the semantic representation of large language models (LLMs). However, such datasets are rare, especially for non-English languages. Here, we present ChineseEEG-2, a high-density EEG dataset designed for benchmarking neural decoding models under real-world language tasks. Building on our previous ChineseEEG dataset, which focused on silent reading, ChineseEEG-2 adds two active modalities: Reading Aloud (RA) and Passive Listening (PL), using the same Chinese corpus. EEG and audio were simultaneously recorded from four participants during ~10.7 hours of reading aloud. These recordings were then played to eight other participants, collecting ~21.6 hours of EEG during listening. This setup enables speech temporal and semantic alignment across the RA and PL modalities. ChineseEEG-2 includes EEG signals, precise audio, aligned semantic embeddings from pre-trained language models, and task labels. Together with ChineseEEG, this dataset supports joint semantic alignment learning across speaking, listening, and reading. It enables benchmarking of neural decoding algorithms and promotes brain-LLM alignment under multimodal language tasks, especially in Chinese. ChineseEEG-2 provides a benchmark dataset for next-generation neural semantic decoding.

Title: Information Bulletin Strategy in Impatient Queuing
Authors: Anthony Kiggundu, Bin Han, Hans D. Schotten
Abstract: In Sixth Generation (6G) networks, decentralized control in multi-tenant systems is a suggested enabler for autonomous network operations. However, autonomy requires independent rationale decisions be taken by tenants. This rationality can only be underpinned by timely and continuous access to status information. Despite its importance, the questions of what information should be shared, how much should be communicated, and how frequently updates should be dispatched remain open research challenges. This manuscript proposes an information bulletin strategy defined around two models of the system descriptor states to address these fundamental questions. The strategy is that queues periodically broadcast these information models to tenants at different time intervals, who may respond by reneging from the queue or jockeying to a more favorable one. The expectation is that over time, the queues adapt their processing rates based on what they learn from the tenant behavior. The objective is to minimize overall delay and the impatience. We formulate for this impatience as an optimization problem, whose analytical solution is intractable. We perform numerical experiments to evaluate the performance of the learned queue policy and to assess how closely it approaches optimal conditions.

Title: Delay-Doppler Domain Signal Processing Aided OFDM (DD-a-OFDM) for 6G and Beyond
Authors: Yiyan Ma, Bo Ai, Jinhong Yuan, Shuangyang Li, Qingqing Cheng, Zhenguo Shi, Weijie Yuan, Zhiqiang Wei, Akram Shafie, Guoyu Ma, Yunlong Lu, Mi Yang, Zhangdui Zhong
Abstract: High-mobility scenarios will be a critical part of 6G systems. Since the widely deployed orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform suffers from subcarrier orthogonality loss under severe Doppler spread, delay-Doppler domain multi-carrier (DDMC) modulation systems, such as orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), have been extensively studied. While OTFS can exploit time-frequency (TF) domain channel diversity, it faces challenges including high receiver complexity and inflexible TF resource allocation, making OFDM still the most promising waveform for 6G. In this article, we propose a DD domain signal processing-aided OFDM (DD-a-OFDM) scheme to enhance OFDM performance based on DDMC research insights. First, we design a DD-a-OFDM system structure, retaining the classical OFDM transceiver while incorporating DD domain channel estimation and TF domain equalization. Second, we detail DD domain channel estimation using discrete TF pilots and prove that TF domain inter-carrier interference (ICI) could be transformed into DD domain Gaussian interference. Third, we derive closed-form CramÃ©r-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for DD domain channel estimation. Fourth, we develop maximum likelihood (ML) and peak detection-based channel estimators, along with a corresponding TF domain equalizer. Numerical results verify the proposed design, showing that DD-a-OFDM reduces the bit-error rate (BER) compared to classical OFDM and outperforms OTFS in channel estimation accuracy with lower pilot overhead.

Title: A virtual sensor fusion approach for state of charge estimation of lithium-ion cells
Authors: Davide Previtali, Daniele Masti, Mirko Mazzoleni, Fabio Previdi
Abstract: This paper addresses the estimation of the State Of Charge (SOC) of lithium-ion cells via the combination of two widely used paradigms: Kalman Filters (KFs) equipped with Equivalent Circuit Models (ECMs) and machine-learning approaches. In particular, a recent Virtual Sensor (VS) synthesis technique is considered, which operates as follows: (i) learn an Affine Parameter-Varying (APV) model of the cell directly from data, (ii) derive a bank of linear observers from the APV model, (iii) train a machine-learning technique from features extracted from the observers together with input and output data to predict the SOC. The SOC predictions returned by the VS are supplied to an Extended KF (EKF) as output measurements along with the cell terminal voltage, combining the two paradigms. A data-driven calibration strategy for the noise covariance matrices of the EKF is proposed. Experimental results show that the designed approach is beneficial w.r.t. SOC estimation accuracy and smoothness.

Title: Less Signals, More Understanding: Channel-Capacity Codebook Design for Digital Task-Oriented Semantic Communication
Authors: Anbang Zhang, Shuaishuai Guo, Chenyuan Feng, Hongyang Du, Haojin Li, Chen Sun, Haijun Zhang
Abstract: Discrete representation has emerged as a powerful tool in task-oriented semantic communication (ToSC), offering compact, interpretable, and efficient representations well-suited for low-power edge intelligence scenarios. Its inherent digital nature aligns seamlessly with hardware-friendly deployment and robust storage/transmission protocols. However, despite its strengths, current ToSC frameworks often decouple semantic-aware discrete mapping from the underlying channel characteristics and task demands. This mismatch leads to suboptimal communication performance, degraded task utility, and limited generalization under variable wireless conditions. Moreover, conventional designs frequently overlook channel-awareness in codebook construction, restricting the effectiveness of semantic symbol selection under constrained resources. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a channel-aware discrete semantic coding framework tailored for low-power edge networks. Leveraging a Wasserstein-regularized objective, our approach aligns discrete code activations with optimal input distributions, thereby improving semantic fidelity, robustness, and task accuracy. Extensive experiments on the inference tasks across diverse signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes show that our method achieves notable gains in accuracy and communication efficiency. This work provides new insights into integrating discrete semantics and channel optimization, paving the way for the widespread adoption of semantic communication in future digital infrastructures.

Title: Edge2Prompt: Modality-Agnostic Model for Out-of-Distribution Liver Segmentation
Authors: Nathan Hollet, Oumeymah Cherkaoui, Philippe C. Cattin, Sidaty El hadramy
Abstract: Liver segmentation is essential for preoperative planning in interventions like tumor resection or transplantation, but implementation in clinical workflows faces challenges due to modality-specific tools and data scarcity. We propose Edge2Prompt, a novel pipeline for modality-agnostic liver segmentation that generalizes to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our method integrates classical edge detection with foundation models. Modality-agnostic edge maps are first extracted from input images, then processed by a U-Net to generate logit-based prompts. These prompts condition the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM-2) to generate 2D liver segmentations, which can then be reconstructed into 3D volumes. Evaluated on the multi-modal CHAOS dataset, Edge2Prompt achieves competitive results compared to classical segmentation methods when trained and tested in-distribution (ID), and outperforms them in data-scarce scenarios due to the SAM-2 module. Furthermore, it achieves a mean Dice Score of 86.4% on OOD tasks, outperforming U-Net baselines by 27.4% and other self-prompting methods by 9.1%, demonstrating its effectiveness. This work bridges classical and foundation models for clinically adaptable, data-efficient segmentation.

Title: Energy Efficient Fluid Antenna Relay (FAR)-Assisted Wireless Communications
Authors: Ruopeng Xu, Zhaohui Yang, Zhaoyang Zhang, Mohammad Shikh-Bahaei, Kaibin Huang, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an energy efficient wireless communication system based on fluid antenna relay (FAR) to solve the problem of non-line-of-sight (NLoS) links caused by blockages with considering the physical properties. Driven by the demand for the sixth generation (6G) communication, fluid antenna systems (FASs) have become a key technology due to their flexibility in dynamically adjusting antenna positions. Existing research on FAS primarily focuses on line-of-sight (LoS) communication scenarios, and neglects the situations where only NLoS links exist. To address the issues posted by NLoS communication, we design an FAR-assisted communication system combined with amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol. In order to alleviate the high energy consumption introduced by AF protocol while ensuring communication quality, we formulate an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem. By optimizing the positions of the fluid antennas (FAs) on both sides of the FAR, we achieve controllable phase shifts of the signals transmitting through the blockage which causes the NLoS link. Besides, we establish a channel model that jointly considers the blockage-through matrix, large-scale fading, and small-scale fading. To maximize the EE of the system, we jointly optimize the FAR position, FA positions, power control, and beamforming design under given constraints, and propose an iterative algorithm to solve this formulated optimization problem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional schemes in terms of EE, achieving up to $23.39\%$ and $39.94\%$ higher EE than the conventional reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) scheme and traditional AF relay scheme, respectively.

Title: Near-field Liquid Crystal RIS Phase-Shift Design for Secure Wideband Illumination
Authors: Mohamadreza Delbari, Qikai Zhou, Robin Neuder, Alejandro JimÃ©nez-SÃ¡ez, Vahid Jamali
Abstract: Liquid crystal (LC) technology provides a low-power and scalable approach to implement a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). However, the LC-based RIS's phase-shift response is inherently frequency-dependent, which can lead to performance degradation if not properly addressed. This issue becomes especially critical in secure communication systems, where such variations may result in considerable information leakage. To avoid the need for full channel state information (CSI) acquisition and frequent RIS reconfiguration, we design RIS for a wideband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system to illuminate a desired area containing legitimate users while avoiding leakage to regions where potential eavesdroppers may be located. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves the secrecy rate compared to methods that neglect frequency-dependent effects. In the considered setup, the proposed method achieves a secrecy rate of about 2 bits/symbol over an 8 GHz bandwidth when the center frequency is 60 GHz.

Title: Binaural Sound Event Localization and Detection Neural Network based on HRTF Localization Cues for Humanoid Robots
Authors: Gyeong-Tae Lee
Abstract: Humanoid robots require simultaneous sound event type and direction estimation for situational awareness, but conventional two-channel input struggles with elevation estimation and front-back confusion. This paper proposes a binaural sound event localization and detection (BiSELD) neural network to address these challenges. BiSELDnet learns time-frequency patterns and head-related transfer function (HRTF) localization cues from binaural input features. A novel eight-channel binaural time-frequency feature (BTFF) is introduced, comprising left/right mel-spectrograms, V-maps, an interaural time difference (ITD) map (below 1.5 kHz), an interaural level difference (ILD) map (above 5 kHz with front-back asymmetry), and spectral cue (SC) maps (above 5 kHz for elevation). The effectiveness of BTFF was confirmed across omnidirectional, horizontal, and median planes. BiSELDnets, particularly one based on the efficient Trinity module, were implemented to output time series of direction vectors for each sound event class, enabling simultaneous detection and localization. Vector activation map (VAM) visualization was proposed to analyze network learning, confirming BiSELDnet's focus on the N1 notch frequency for elevation estimation. Comparative evaluations under urban background noise conditions demonstrated that the proposed BiSELD model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) SELD models with binaural input.

Title: Design of Adaptive Hybrid Downlink NOMA-TDMA for Visible Light Communications Networks
Authors: Tuan A. Hoang, Chuyen T. Nguyen, Thanh V. Pham
Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme for multi-user visible light communication (VLC) networks, aiming to enhance users' sum-rate performance while maintaining low complexity. In the proposed scheme, users are divided into groups where each group is served in a different time slot using TDMA. Within each group, up to two users can be served simultaneously using NOMA. A central challenge lies in determining which users should be paired together for NOMA, as the effectiveness of successive interference cancellation (SIC) employed by NOMA depends on the difference between users' channel gains. To address this, for a pair of users, we determine the range of their channel gain ratio within which the pair benefits more from NOMA or TDMA. Identifying the lower and upper bounds of this range is formulated as two optimization problems which are solved efficiently using the Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional hybrid NOMA-TDMA method under different numbers of users and transmit LED powers.

Title: Error Accumulation using Linearized Models for Aggregating Flexibility in Distribution Systems
Authors: Yanlin Jiang, Xinliang Dai, Frederik Zahn, Yi Guo, Veit Hagenmeyer
Abstract: This paper investigates flexibility aggregation approaches based on linear models. We begin by examining the theoretical foundations of linear AC power flow, two variants of so-called DC power flow, and the LinDistFlow model, along with their underlying assumptions. The discussion covers key system details, including network topology, voltage constraints, and line losses. Simulations are conducted on the KIT Campus Nord network with real demand and solar data. Results show that, in the absence of negative losses, line losses are generally underestimated by linear models. Furthermore, line losses errors tend to accumulate both at the point of common coupling (PCC) and over extended time horizons.

Title: Discriminating Distal Ischemic Stroke from Seizure-Induced Stroke Mimics Using Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast MRI
Authors: Marijn Borghouts, Richard McKinley, Josien Pluim, Manuel KÃ¶stner, Roland Wiest, Ruisheng Su
Abstract: Distinguishing acute ischemic strokes (AIS) from stroke mimics (SMs), particularly in cases involving medium and small vessel occlusions, remains a significant diagnostic challenge. While computed tomography (CT) based protocols are commonly used in emergency settings, their sensitivity for detecting distal occlusions is limited. This study explores the potential of magnetic resonance perfusion (MRP) imaging as a tool for differentiating distal AIS from epileptic seizures, a prevalent SM. Using a retrospective dataset of 162 patients (129 AIS, 33 seizures), we extracted region-wise perfusion map descriptors (PMDs) from dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) images. Statistical analyses identified several brain regions, located mainly in the temporal and occipital lobe, exhibiting significant group differences in certain PMDs. Hemispheric asymmetry analyses further highlighted these regions as discriminative. A logistic regression model trained on PMDs achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of 0.90, and an area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.74, with a specificity of 92% and a sensitivity of 73%, suggesting strong performance in distinguishing distal AIS from seizures. These findings support further exploration of MRP-based PMDs as interpretable features for distinguishing true strokes from various mimics.

Title: Text adaptation for speaker verification with speaker-text factorized embeddings
Authors: Yexin Yang, Shuai Wang, Xun Gong, Yanmin Qian, Kai Yu
Abstract: Text mismatch between pre-collected data, either training data or enrollment data, and the actual test data can significantly hurt text-dependent speaker verification (SV) system performance. Although this problem can be solved by carefully collecting data with the target speech content, such data collection could be costly and inflexible. In this paper, we propose a novel text adaptation framework to address the text mismatch issue. Here, a speaker-text factorization network is proposed to factorize the input speech into speaker embeddings and text embeddings and then integrate them into a single representation in the later stage. Given a small amount of speaker-independent adaptation utterances, text embeddings of target speech content can be extracted and used to adapt the text-independent speaker embeddings to text-customized speaker embeddings. Experiments on RSR2015 show that text adaptation can significantly improve the performance of text mismatch conditions.

Abstract: Masked autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful approach for pre-training on unlabelled data, capable of learning robust and informative feature representations. This is particularly advantageous in diffused lung disease research, where annotated imaging datasets are scarce. To leverage this, we train an MAE on a curated collection of over 5,000 chest computed tomography (CT) scans, combining in-house data with publicly available scans from related conditions that exhibit similar radiological patterns, such as COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia. The pretrained MAE is then fine-tuned on a downstream classification task for diffused lung disease diagnosis. Our findings demonstrate that MAEs can effectively extract clinically meaningful features and improve diagnostic performance, even in the absence of large-scale labelled datasets.

Title: TotalRegistrator: Towards a Lightweight Foundation Model for CT Image Registration

Abstract: Image registration is a fundamental technique in the analysis of longitudinal and multi-phase CT images within clinical practice. However, most existing methods are tailored for single-organ applications, limiting their generalizability to other anatomical regions. This work presents TotalRegistrator, an image registration framework capable of aligning multiple anatomical regions simultaneously using a standard UNet architecture and a novel field decomposition strategy. The model is lightweight, requiring only 11GB of GPU memory for training. To train and evaluate our method, we constructed a large-scale longitudinal dataset comprising 695 whole-body (thorax-abdomen-pelvic) paired CT scans from individual patients acquired at different time points. We benchmarked TotalRegistrator against a generic classical iterative algorithm and a recent foundation model for image registration. To further assess robustness and generalizability, we evaluated our model on three external datasets: the public thoracic and abdominal datasets from the Learn2Reg challenge, and a private multiphase abdominal dataset from a collaborating hospital. Experimental results on the in-house dataset show that the proposed approach generally surpasses baseline methods in multi-organ abdominal registration, with a slight drop in lung alignment performance. On out-of-distribution datasets, it achieved competitive results compared to leading single-organ models, despite not being fine-tuned for those tasks, demonstrating strong generalizability.

Title: Case Studies of Generative Machine Learning Models for Dynamical Systems
Authors: Nachiket U. Bapat, Randy C. Paffenroth, Raghvendra V. Cowlagi
Abstract: Systems like aircraft and spacecraft are expensive to operate in the real world. The design, validation, and testing for such systems therefore relies on a combination of mathematical modeling, abundant numerical simulations, and a relatively small set of real-world experiments. Due to modeling errors, simplifications, and uncertainties, the data synthesized by simulation models often does not match data from the system's real-world operation. We consider the broad research question of whether this model mismatch can be significantly reduced by generative artificial intelligence models (GAIMs). Unlike text- or image-processing, where generative models have attained recent successes, GAIM development for aerospace engineering applications must not only train with scarce operational data, but their outputs must also satisfy governing equations based on natural laws, e.g., conservation laws. The scope of this paper primarily focuses on two case studies of optimally controlled systems that are commonly understood and employed in aircraft guidance, namely: minimum-time navigation in a wind field and minimum-exposure navigation in a threat field. We report GAIMs that are trained with a relatively small set, of the order of a few hundred, of examples and with underlying governing equations. By focusing on optimally controlled systems, we formulate training loss functions based on invariance of the Hamiltonian function along system trajectories. We investigate three GAIM architectures, namely: the generative adversarial network (GAN) and two variants of the variational autoencoder (VAE). We provide architectural details and thorough performance analyses of these models. The main finding is that our new models, especially the VAE-based models, are able to synthesize data that satisfy the governing equations and are statistically similar to the training data despite small volumes of training data.

Title: OpenDCVCs: A PyTorch Open Source Implementation and Performance Evaluation of the DCVC series Video Codecs
Authors: Yichi Zhang, Fengqing Zhu
Abstract: We present OpenDCVCs, an open-source PyTorch implementation designed to advance reproducible research in learned video compression. OpenDCVCs provides unified and training-ready implementations of four representative Deep Contextual Video Compression (DCVC) models--DCVC, DCVC with Temporal Context Modeling (DCVC-TCM), DCVC with Hybrid Entropy Modeling (DCVC-HEM), and DCVC with Diverse Contexts (DCVC-DC). While the DCVC series achieves substantial bitrate reductions over both classical codecs and advanced learned models, previous public code releases have been limited to evaluation codes, presenting significant barriers to reproducibility, benchmarking, and further development. OpenDCVCs bridges this gap by offering a comprehensive, self-contained framework that supports both end-to-end training and evaluation for all included algorithms. The implementation includes detailed documentation, evaluation protocols, and extensive benchmarking results across diverse datasets, providing a transparent and consistent foundation for comparison and extension. All code and experimental tools are publicly available at this https URL, empowering the community to accelerate research and foster collaboration.

Title: Pitfalls and Limits in Automatic Dementia Assessment
Authors: Franziska Braun, Christopher Witzl, Andreas Erzigkeit, Hartmut Lehfeld, Thomas Hillemacher, Tobias Bocklet, Korbinian Riedhammer
Abstract: Current work on speech-based dementia assessment focuses on either feature extraction to predict assessment scales, or on the automation of existing test procedures. Most research uses public data unquestioningly and rarely performs a detailed error analysis, focusing primarily on numerical performance. We perform an in-depth analysis of an automated standardized dementia assessment, the Syndrom-Kurz-Test. We find that while there is a high overall correlation with human annotators, due to certain artifacts, we observe high correlations for the severely impaired individuals, which is less true for the healthy or mildly impaired ones. Speech production decreases with cognitive decline, leading to overoptimistic correlations when test scoring relies on word naming. Depending on the test design, fallback handling introduces further biases that favor certain groups. These pitfalls remain independent of group distributions in datasets and require differentiated analysis of target groups.

Title: Conditional Fetal Brain Atlas Learning for Automatic Tissue Segmentation
Authors: Johannes Tischer, Patric Kienast, Marlene StÃ¼mpflen, Gregor Kasprian, Georg Langs, Roxane Licandro
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the fetal brain has become a key tool for studying brain development in vivo. Yet, its assessment remains challenging due to variability in brain maturation, imaging protocols, and uncertain estimates of Gestational Age (GA). To overcome these, brain atlases provide a standardized reference framework that facilitates objective evaluation and comparison across subjects by aligning the atlas and subjects in a common coordinate system. In this work, we introduce a novel deep-learning framework for generating continuous, age-specific fetal brain atlases for real-time fetal brain tissue segmentation. The framework combines a direct registration model with a conditional discriminator. Trained on a curated dataset of 219 neurotypical fetal MRIs spanning from 21 to 37 weeks of gestation. The method achieves high registration accuracy, captures dynamic anatomical changes with sharp structural detail, and robust segmentation performance with an average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 86.3% across six brain tissues. Furthermore, volumetric analysis of the generated atlases reveals detailed neurotypical growth trajectories, providing valuable insights into the maturation of the fetal brain. This approach enables individualized developmental assessment with minimal pre-processing and real-time performance, supporting both research and clinical applications. The model code is available at this https URL

Title: LA-CaRe-CNN: Cascading Refinement CNN for Left Atrial Scar Segmentation
Authors: Franz Thaler, Darko Stern, Gernot Plank, Martin Urschler
Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) represents the most prevalent type of cardiac arrhythmia for which treatment may require patients to undergo ablation therapy. In this surgery cardiac tissues are locally scarred on purpose to prevent electrical signals from causing arrhythmia. Patient-specific cardiac digital twin models show great potential for personalized ablation therapy, however, they demand accurate semantic segmentation of healthy and scarred tissue typically obtained from late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) magnetic resonance (MR) scans. In this work we propose the Left Atrial Cascading Refinement CNN (LA-CaRe-CNN), which aims to accurately segment the left atrium as well as left atrial scar tissue from LGE MR scans. LA-CaRe-CNN is a 2-stage CNN cascade that is trained end-to-end in 3D, where Stage 1 generates a prediction for the left atrium, which is then refined in Stage 2 in conjunction with the original image information to obtain a prediction for the left atrial scar tissue. To account for domain shift towards domains unknown during training, we employ strong intensity and spatial augmentation to increase the diversity of the training dataset. Our proposed method based on a 5-fold ensemble achieves great segmentation results, namely, 89.21% DSC and 1.6969 mm ASSD for the left atrium, as well as 64.59% DSC and 91.80% G-DSC for the more challenging left atrial scar tissue. Thus, segmentations obtained through LA-CaRe-CNN show great potential for the generation of patient-specific cardiac digital twin models and downstream tasks like personalized targeted ablation therapy to treat AF.

Title: Joint Communication and Indoor Positioning Based on Visible Light in the Presence of Dimming
Authors: A. Tarik Leblebici, Sumeyra Hassan, Erdal Panayirci, H. Vincent Poor
Abstract: This paper proposes a joint communication and indoor positioning (JCP) system based on visible light communication (VLC) designed for high-precision indoor environments. The framework supports 2D and 3D positioning using received signal strength (RSS) from pilot transmissions, enhanced by the radical axis theorem to improve accuracy under measurement uncertainties. Communication is achieved using spatial modulation (SM) with M-ary pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), where data is conveyed through the modulation symbol and the active light-emitting diode (LED) index, improving spectral efficiency while maintaining low complexity. A pilot-aided least squares (LS) estimator is employed for joint channel and dimming coefficient estimation, enabling robust symbol detection in multipath environments characterized by both line-of-sight (LOS) and diffuse non-line-of-sight (NLOS) components, modeled using Rician fading. The proposed system incorporates a dimming control mechanism to meet lighting requirements while maintaining reliable communication and positioning performance. Simulation results demonstrate sub-centimeter localization accuracy at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and bit error rates (BERs) below 10^{-6} for low-order PAM schemes. Additionally, comparative analysis across user locations reveals that positioning and communication performance improve significantly near the geometric center of the LED layout. These findings validate the effectiveness of the proposed system for future 6G indoor networks requiring integrated localization and communication under practical channel conditions.

Title: UniTalker: Conversational Speech-Visual Synthesis
Authors: Yifan Hu, Rui Liu, Yi Ren, Xiang Yin, Haizhou Li
Abstract: Conversational Speech Synthesis (CSS) is a key task in the user-agent interaction area, aiming to generate more expressive and empathetic speech for users. However, it is well-known that "listening" and "eye contact" play crucial roles in conveying emotions during real-world interpersonal communication. Existing CSS research is limited to perceiving only text and speech within the dialogue context, which restricts its effectiveness. Moreover, speech-only responses further constrain the interactive experience. To address these limitations, we introduce a Conversational Speech-Visual Synthesis (CSVS) task as an extension of traditional CSS. By leveraging multimodal dialogue context, it provides users with coherent audiovisual responses. To this end, we develop a CSVS system named UniTalker, which is a unified model that seamlessly integrates multimodal perception and multimodal rendering capabilities. Specifically, it leverages a large-scale language model to comprehensively understand multimodal cues in the dialogue context, including speaker, text, speech, and the talking-face animations. After that, it employs multi-task sequence prediction to first infer the target utterance's emotion and then generate empathetic speech and natural talking-face animations. To ensure that the generated speech-visual content remains consistent in terms of emotion, content, and duration, we introduce three key optimizations: 1) Designing a specialized neural landmark codec to tokenize and reconstruct facial expression sequences. 2) Proposing a bimodal speech-visual hard alignment decoding strategy. 3) Applying emotion-guided rendering during the generation stage. Comprehensive objective and subjective experiments demonstrate that our model synthesizes more empathetic speech and provides users with more natural and emotionally consistent talking-face animations.

Title: A Comprehensive Framework for Uncertainty Quantification of Voxel-wise Supervised Models in IVIM MRI
Authors: Nicola Casali, Alessandro Brusaferri, Giuseppe Baselli, Stefano Fumagalli, Edoardo Micotti, Gianluigi Forloni, Riaz Hussein, Giovanna Rizzo, Alfonso Mastropietro
Abstract: Accurate estimation of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) parameters from diffusion-weighted MRI remains challenging due to the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem and high sensitivity to noise, particularly in the perfusion compartment. In this work, we propose a probabilistic deep learning framework based on Deep Ensembles (DE) of Mixture Density Networks (MDNs), enabling estimation of total predictive uncertainty and decomposition into aleatoric (AU) and epistemic (EU) components. The method was benchmarked against non probabilistic neural networks, a Bayesian fitting approach and a probabilistic network with single Gaussian parametrization. Supervised training was performed on synthetic data, and evaluation was conducted on both simulated and two in vivo datasets. The reliability of the quantified uncertainties was assessed using calibration curves, output distribution sharpness, and the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). MDNs produced more calibrated and sharper predictive distributions for the D and f parameters, although slight overconfidence was observed in D*. The Robust Coefficient of Variation (RCV) indicated smoother in vivo estimates for D* with MDNs compared to Gaussian model. Despite the training data covering the expected physiological range, elevated EU in vivo suggests a mismatch with real acquisition conditions, highlighting the importance of incorporating EU, which was allowed by DE. Overall, we present a comprehensive framework for IVIM fitting with uncertainty quantification, which enables the identification and interpretation of unreliable estimates. The proposed approach can also be adopted for fitting other physical models through appropriate architectural and simulation adjustments.

Title: TaxSolver: A methodology to design optimal income tax reform
Authors: Mark Verhagen, Menno Schellekens, Michael Garstka
Abstract: Across the developed world, there are growing calls to streamline and improve ever more complex income tax codes. Executing reform has proven difficult. Even when the desired outcomes of a reform are clear, the tools to design fitting reforms are lacking. To remedy this, we developed \texttt{TaxSolver}: a methodology to help policymakers realize optimal income tax reform. \texttt{TaxSolver} allows policymakers to focus solely on what they aim to achieve with a reform -- like redistributing wealth, incentivizing labor market participation or reducing complexity -- and the guarantees within which reform is acceptable -- like limiting fluctuations in taxpayer incomes, protecting households from falling into poverty or shocks to overall tax revenue. Given these goals and fiscal guarantees, \texttt{TaxSolver} finds the optimal set of tax rules that satisfies all the criteria or shows that the set of demands are not mathematically feasible. We illustrate \texttt{TaxSolver} by reforming various simulated examples of tax codes, including some that reflect the complexity and size of a real-world tax system.

Title: Outlier Detection Algorithm for Circle Fitting
Authors: Ahmet GÃ¶khan Poyraz
Abstract: Circle fitting methods are extensively utilized in various industries, particularly in quality control processes and design applications. The effectiveness of these algorithms can be significantly compromised when the point sets to be predicted are noisy. To mitigate this issue, outlier detection and removal algorithms are often applied before the circle fitting procedure. This study introduces the Polar Coordinate-Based Outlier Detection (PCOD) algorithm, which can be effectively employed in circle fitting applications. In the proposed approach, the point set is first transformed into polar coordinates, followed by the calculation of both local and global standard deviations. Outliers are then identified by comparing local mean values with the global standard deviation. The practicality and efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated by focusing on the high-precision diameter measurement of industrial washer parts. Images from a machine vision system are processed through preprocessing steps, including sub-pixel edge detection. The resulting sub-pixel edge points are then cleaned using the proposed outlier detection and removal algorithm, after which circle fitting is performed. A comparison is made using ten different circle fitting algorithms and five distinct outlier detection methods. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the other approaches, delivering the best performance in terms of accuracy within the dataset, thereby demonstrating its potential for enhancing circle fitting applications in industrial environments.

Title: Enhancing Diameter Measurement Accuracy in Machine Vision Applications
Authors: Ahmet Gokhan Poyraz, Ahmet Emir Dirik, Hakan Gurkan, Mehmet Kacmaz
Abstract: In camera measurement systems, specialized equipment such as telecentric lenses is often employed to measure parts with narrow tolerances. However, despite the use of such equipment, measurement errors can occur due to mechanical and software-related factors within the system. These errors are particularly evident in applications where parts of different diameters are measured using the same setup. This study proposes two innovative approaches to enhance measurement accuracy using multiple known reference parts: a conversion factor-based method and a pixel-based method. In the first approach, the conversion factor is estimated from known references to calculate the diameter (mm) of the unknown part. In the second approach, the diameter (mm) is directly estimated using pixel-based diameter information from the references. The experimental setup includes an industrial-grade camera and telecentric lenses. Tests conducted on glass samples (1-12 mm) and metal workpieces (3-24 mm) show that measurement errors, which originally ranged from 13-114 micrometers, were reduced to 1-2 micrometers using the proposed methods. By utilizing only a few known reference parts, the proposed approach enables high-accuracy measurement of all parts within the camera's field of view. Additionally, this method enhances the existing diameter measurement literature by significantly reducing error rates and improving measurement reliability.

Title: TIR-Diffusion: Diffusion-based Thermal Infrared Image Denoising via Latent and Wavelet Domain Optimization
Authors: Tai Hyoung Rhee, Dong-guw Lee, Ayoung Kim
Abstract: Thermal infrared imaging exhibits considerable potentials for robotic perception tasks, especially in environments with poor visibility or challenging lighting conditions. However, TIR images typically suffer from heavy non-uniform fixed-pattern noise, complicating tasks such as object detection, localization, and mapping. To address this, we propose a diffusion-based TIR image denoising framework leveraging latent-space representations and wavelet-domain optimization. Utilizing a pretrained stable diffusion model, our method fine-tunes the model via a novel loss function combining latent-space and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) / dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) losses. Additionally, we implement a cascaded refinement stage to enhance fine details, ensuring high-fidelity denoising results. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art denoising methods. Furthermore, our method exhibits robust zero-shot generalization to diverse and challenging real-world TIR datasets, underscoring its effectiveness for practical robotic deployment.

Title: Closed-Circuit Television Data as an Emergent Data Source for Urban Rail Platform Crowding Estimation
Authors: Riccardo Fiorista, Awad Abdelhalim, Anson F. Stewart, Gabriel L. Pincus, Ian Thistle, Jinhua Zhao
Abstract: Accurately estimating urban rail platform occupancy can enhance transit agencies' ability to make informed operational decisions, thereby improving safety, operational efficiency, and customer experience, particularly in the context of crowding. However, sensing real-time crowding remains challenging and often depends on indirect proxies such as automatic fare collection data or staff observations. Recently, Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage has emerged as a promising data source with the potential to yield accurate, real-time occupancy estimates. The presented study investigates this potential by comparing three state-of-the-art computer vision approaches for extracting crowd-related features from platform CCTV imagery: (a) object detection and counting using YOLOv11, RT-DETRv2, and APGCC; (b) crowd-level classification via a custom-trained Vision Transformer, Crowd-ViT; and (c) semantic segmentation using DeepLabV3. Additionally, we present a novel, highly efficient linear-optimization-based approach to extract counts from the generated segmentation maps while accounting for image object depth and, thus, for passenger dispersion along a platform. Tested on a privacy-preserving dataset created in collaboration with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) that encompasses more than 600 hours of video material, our results demonstrate that computer vision approaches can provide substantive value for crowd estimation. This work demonstrates that CCTV image data, independent of other data sources available to a transit agency, can enable more precise real-time crowding estimation and, eventually, timely operational responses for platform crowding mitigation.

Title: GlaBoost: A multimodal Structured Framework for Glaucoma Risk Stratification
Authors: Cheng Huang, Weizheng Xie, Karanjit Kooner, Tsengdar Lee, Jui-Kai Wang, Jia Zhang
Abstract: Early and accurate detection of glaucoma is critical to prevent irreversible vision loss. However, existing methods often rely on unimodal data and lack interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. In this paper, we present GlaBoost, a multimodal gradient boosting framework that integrates structured clinical features, fundus image embeddings, and expert-curated textual descriptions for glaucoma risk prediction. GlaBoost extracts high-level visual representations from retinal fundus photographs using a pretrained convolutional encoder and encodes free-text neuroretinal rim assessments using a transformer-based language model. These heterogeneous signals, combined with manually assessed risk scores and quantitative ophthalmic indicators, are fused into a unified feature space for classification via an enhanced XGBoost model. Experiments conducted on a real-world annotated dataset demonstrate that GlaBoost significantly outperforms baseline models, achieving a validation accuracy of 98.71%. Feature importance analysis reveals clinically consistent patterns, with cup-to-disc ratio, rim pallor, and specific textual embeddings contributing most to model decisions. GlaBoost offers a transparent and scalable solution for interpretable glaucoma diagnosis and can be extended to other ophthalmic disorders.

Title: Are Inherently Interpretable Models More Robust? A Study In Music Emotion Recognition
Authors: Katharina Hoedt, Arthur Flexer, Gerhard Widmer
Abstract: One of the desired key properties of deep learning models is the ability to generalise to unseen samples. When provided with new samples that are (perceptually) similar to one or more training samples, deep learning models are expected to produce correspondingly similar outputs. Models that succeed in predicting similar outputs for similar inputs are often called robust. Deep learning models, on the other hand, have been shown to be highly vulnerable to minor (adversarial) perturbations of the input, which manage to drastically change a model's output and simultaneously expose its reliance on spurious correlations. In this work, we investigate whether inherently interpretable deep models, i.e., deep models that were designed to focus more on meaningful and interpretable features, are more robust to irrelevant perturbations in the data, compared to their black-box counterparts. We test our hypothesis by comparing the robustness of an interpretable and a black-box music emotion recognition (MER) model when challenged with adversarial examples. Furthermore, we include an adversarially trained model, which is optimised to be more robust, in the comparison. Our results indicate that inherently more interpretable models can indeed be more robust than their black-box counterparts, and achieve similar levels of robustness as adversarially trained models, at lower computational cost.

Title: CASH: Context-Aware Smart Handover for Reliable UAV Connectivity on Aerial Corridors
Authors: Abdul Saboor, Zhuangzhuang Cui, Achiel Colpaert, Evgenii Vinogradov, Sofie Pollin
Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) envisions aerial corridors for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to reduce ground traffic congestion by supporting 3D mobility, such as air taxis. A key challenge in these high-mobility aerial corridors is ensuring reliable connectivity, where frequent handovers can degrade network performance. To resolve this, we present a Context-Aware Smart Handover (CASH) protocol that uses a forward-looking scoring mechanism based on UAV trajectory to make proactive handover decisions. We evaluate the performance of the proposed CASH against existing handover protocols in a custom-built simulator. Results show that CASH reduces handover frequency by up to 78% while maintaining low outage probability. We then investigate the impact of base station density and safety margin on handover performance, where their optimal setups are empirically obtained to ensure reliable UAM communication.

Title: Data-Driven Spectrum Demand Prediction: A Spatio-Temporal Framework with Transfer Learning
Authors: Amin Farajzadeh, Hongzhao Zheng, Sarah Dumoulin, Trevor Ha, Halim Yanikomeroglu, Amir Ghasemi
Abstract: Accurate spectrum demand prediction is crucial for informed spectrum allocation, effective regulatory planning, and fostering sustainable growth in modern wireless communication networks. It supports governmental efforts, particularly those led by the international telecommunication union (ITU), to establish fair spectrum allocation policies, improve auction mechanisms, and meet the requirements of emerging technologies such as advanced 5G, forthcoming 6G, and the internet of things (IoT). This paper presents an effective spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages crowdsourced user-side key performance indicators (KPIs) and regulatory datasets to model and forecast spectrum demand. The proposed methodology achieves superior prediction accuracy and cross-regional generalizability by incorporating advanced feature engineering, comprehensive correlation analysis, and transfer learning techniques. Unlike traditional ITU models, which are often constrained by arbitrary inputs and unrealistic assumptions, this approach exploits granular, data-driven insights to account for spatial and temporal variations in spectrum utilization. Comparative evaluations against ITU estimates, as the benchmark, underscore our framework's capability to deliver more realistic and actionable predictions. Experimental results validate the efficacy of our methodology, highlighting its potential as a robust approach for policymakers and regulatory bodies to enhance spectrum management and planning.

Title: Moveless: Minimizing Overhead on QCCDs via Versatile Execution and Low Excess Shuttling
Authors: Sahil Khan, Suhas Vittal, Kenneth Brown, Jonathan Baker
Abstract: One of the most promising paths towards large scale fault tolerant quantum computation is the use of quantum error correcting stabilizer codes. Just like every other quantum circuit, these codes must be compiled to hardware in a way to minimize the total physical error introduced into the system, for example either due to high latency execution or excessive gates to meet connectivity limitations of the target hardware. However, unlike arbitrary quantum circuits, all syndrome extraction circuits have several common properties, for example they have a bipartite connectivity graph, consist only of commuting subcircuits, among other properties. For the most part, compilation methods have aimed at being generic, able to map any input circuit into executables on the hardware, and therefore cannot appropriately exploit these properties and result in executables which have higher physical error. In the case of modular trapped ion systems, specifically QCCDs, this corresponds to the insertion of excessive shuttling operations necessary to realize arbitrary qubit interactions. We propose a compilation scheme explicitly tailored for the structural regularity of QEC circuits based on several key observations: 1. only ancilla or data (but not both) should be shuttled, 2. stabilizers can be executed in any order meaning we can dynamically modify circuit execution on a per-cycle basis 3. ancilla are indistinguishable meaning any can be selected to begin a stabilizer measurement and retain a fixed-point mapping between cycles, and 4. QCCD hardware limits the number of parallel operations equal to the number traps in the system, meaning fewer ancilla are necessary and can be reused. Our resulting compiler, leads to QEC circuits which are on average 3.38x faster to execute, and lead to up to two orders of magnitude of improvement in logical error rates with realistic physical error rates.

Title: Control Closure Certificates
Authors: Vishnu Murali, Mohammed Adib Oumer, Majid Zamani
Abstract: This paper introduces the notion of control closure certificates to synthesize controllers for discrete-time control systems against $\omega$-regular specifications. Typical functional approaches to synthesize controllers against $\omega$-regular specifications rely on combining inductive invariants (for example, via barrier certificates) with proofs of well-foundedness (for example, via ranking functions). Transition invariants, provide an alternative where instead of standard well-foundedness arguments one may instead search for disjunctive well-foundedness arguments that together ensure a well-foundedness argument. Closure certificates, functional analogs of transition invariants, provide an effective, automated approach to verify discrete-time dynamical systems against linear temporal logic and $\omega$-regular specifications. We build on this notion to synthesize controllers to ensure the satisfaction of $\omega$-regular specifications. To do so, we first illustrate how one may construct control closure certificates to visit a region infinitely often (or only finitely often) via disjunctive well-founded arguments. We then combine these arguments to provide an argument for parity specifications. Thus, finding an appropriate control closure certificate over the product of the system and a parity automaton specifying a desired $\omega$-regular specification ensures that there exists a controller $\kappa$ to enforce the $\omega$-regular specification. We propose a sum-of-squares optimization approach to synthesize such certificates and demonstrate their efficacy in designing controllers over some case studies.

Title: Fast Magnetic Resonance Simulation Using Combined Update with Grouped Isochromats
Authors: Hidenori Takeshima
Abstract: This work aims to overcome an assumption of conventional MR simulators: Individual isochromats should be simulated individually. To reduce the computational times of MR simulation, a new simulation method using grouped isochromats is proposed. When multiple isochromats are grouped before simulations, some parts of the simulation can be shared in each group. For a certain gradient type, the isochromats in the group can be easily chosen for ensuring that they behave the same. For example, the group can be defined as the isochromats whose locations along x-axis, T1, T2 and magnetic field inhomogeneity values are the same values. In such groups, simulations can be combined when a pulse sequence with the magnetic field gradient along x-axis only are processed. The processing times of the conventional and proposed methods were evaluated with several sequences including fast spin echo (FSE) and echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequences. The simulation times of the proposed method were 3 to 72 times faster than those of the conventional methods. In the cases of 27.5 million isochromats using single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instructions and multi-threading, the conventional method simulated FSE and EPI sequences in 208.4 and 66.4 seconds, respectively. In the same cases, the proposed method simulated these sequences in 38.1 and 7.1 seconds, respectively.

Title: MiDashengLM: Efficient Audio Understanding with General Audio Captions
Authors: Heinrich Dinkel, Gang Li, Jizhong Liu, Jian Luan, Yadong Niu, Xingwei Sun, Tianzi Wang, Qiyang Xiao, Junbo Zhang, Jiahao Zhou
Abstract: Current approaches for large audio language models (LALMs) often rely on closed data sources or proprietary models, limiting their generalization and accessibility. This paper introduces MiDashengLM, a novel open audio-language model designed for efficient and comprehensive audio understanding through the use of general audio captions using our novel ACAVCaps training dataset. MiDashengLM exclusively relies on publicly available pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets, ensuring full transparency and reproducibility. At its core, MiDashengLM integrates Dasheng, an open-source audio encoder, specifically engineered to process diverse auditory information effectively. Unlike previous works primarily focused on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) based audio-text alignment, our strategy centers on general audio captions, fusing speech, sound and music information into one textual representation, enabling a holistic textual representation of complex audio scenes. Lastly, MiDashengLM provides an up to 4x speedup in terms of time-to-first-token (TTFT) and up to 20x higher throughput than comparable models.

Title: Enabling Site-Specific Cellular Network Simulation Through Ray-Tracing-Driven ns-3
Authors: Tanguy Ropitault, Matteo Bordin, Paolo Testolina, Michele Polese, Pedram Johari, Nada Golmie, Tommaso Melodia
Abstract: Evaluating cellular systems, from 5G New Radio (NR) and 5G-Advanced to 6G, is challenging because the performance emerges from the tight coupling of propagation, beam management, scheduling, and higher-layer interactions. System-level simulation is therefore indispensable, yet the vast majority of studies rely on the statistical 3GPP channel models. These are well suited to capture average behavior across many statistical realizations, but cannot reproduce site-specific phenomena such as corner diffraction, street-canyon blockage, or deterministic line-of-sight conditions and angle-of-departure/arrival relationships that drive directional links. This paper extends 5G-LENA, an NR module for the system-level Network Simulator 3 (ns-3), with a trace-based channel model that processes the Multipath Components (MPCs) obtained from external ray-tracers (e.g., Sionna Ray Tracer (RT)) or measurement campaigns. Our module constructs frequency-domain channel matrices and feeds them to the existing Physical (PHY)/Medium Access Control (MAC) stack without any further modifications. The result is a geometry-based channel model that remains fully compatible with the standard 3GPP implementation in 5G-LENA, while delivering site-specific geometric fidelity. This new module provides a key building block toward Digital Twin (DT) capabilities by offering realistic site-specific channel modeling, unlocking studies that require site awareness, including beam management, blockage mitigation, and environment-aware sensing. We demonstrate its capabilities for precise beam-steering validation and end-to-end metric analysis. In both cases, the trace-driven engine exposes performance inflections that the statistical model does not exhibit, confirming its value for high-fidelity system-level cellular networks research and as a step toward DT applications.

Title: Optimization of sliding control parameters for a 3-dof robot arm using genetic algorithm (GA)
Authors: Vu Ngoc Son, Pham Van Cuong, Dao Thi My Linh, Le Tieu Nien
Abstract: This paper presents a method for optimizing the sliding mode control (SMC) parameter for a robot manipulator applying a genetic algorithm (GA). The objective of the SMC is to achieve precise and consistent tracking of the trajectory of the robot manipulator under uncertain and disturbed conditions. However, the system effectiveness and robustness depend on the choice of the SMC parameters, which is a difficult and crucial task. To solve this problem, a genetic algorithm is used to locate the optimal values of these parameters that gratify the capability criteria. The proposed method is efficient compared with the conventional SMC and Fuzzy-SMC. The simulation results show that the genetic algorithm with SMC can achieve better tracking capability and reduce the chattering effect.

Title: Radar-Based NLoS Pedestrian Localization for Darting-Out Scenarios Near Parked Vehicles with Camera-Assisted Point Cloud Interpretation
Authors: Hee-Yeun Kim, Byeonggyu Park, Byonghyok Choi, Hansang Cho, Byungkwan Kim, Soomok Lee, Mingu Jeon, Seung-Woo Seo, Seong-Woo Kim
Abstract: The presence of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) blind spots resulting from roadside parking in urban environments poses a significant challenge to road safety, particularly due to the sudden emergence of pedestrians. mmWave technology leverages diffraction and reflection to observe NLoS regions, and recent studies have demonstrated its potential for detecting obscured objects. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on predefined spatial information or assume simple wall reflections, thereby limiting their generalizability and practical applicability. A particular challenge arises in scenarios where pedestrians suddenly appear from between parked vehicles, as these parked vehicles act as temporary spatial obstructions. Furthermore, since parked vehicles are dynamic and may relocate over time, spatial information obtained from satellite maps or other predefined sources may not accurately reflect real-time road conditions, leading to erroneous sensor interpretations. To address this limitation, we propose an NLoS pedestrian localization framework that integrates monocular camera image with 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data. The proposed method initially detects parked vehicles through image segmentation, estimates depth to infer approximate spatial characteristics, and subsequently refines this information using 2D radar PCD to achieve precise spatial inference. Experimental evaluations conducted in real-world urban road environments demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances early pedestrian detection and contributes to improved road safety.

Title: Efficient Scaling for LLM-based ASR
Authors: Bingshen Mu, Yiwen Shao, Kun Wei, Dong Yu, Lei Xie
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) achieves strong performance but often incurs high computational costs. This work investigates how to obtain the best LLM-ASR performance efficiently. Through comprehensive and controlled experiments, we find that pretraining the speech encoder before integrating it with the LLM leads to significantly better scaling efficiency than the standard practice of joint post-training of LLM-ASR. Based on this insight, we propose a new multi-stage LLM-ASR training strategy, EFIN: Encoder First Integration. Among all training strategies evaluated, EFIN consistently delivers better performance (relative to 21.1% CERR) with significantly lower computation budgets (49.9% FLOPs). Furthermore, we derive a scaling law that approximates ASR error rates as a computation function, providing practical guidance for LLM-ASR scaling.

Abstract: Underwater image enhancement (UIE) techniques aim to improve visual quality of images captured in aquatic environments by addressing degradation issues caused by light absorption and scattering effects, including color distortion, blurring, and low contrast. Current mainstream solutions predominantly employ multi-scale feature extraction (MSFE) mechanisms to enhance reconstruction quality through multi-resolution feature fusion. However, our extensive experiments demonstrate that high-quality image reconstruction does not necessarily rely on multi-scale feature fusion. Contrary to popular belief, our experiments show that single-scale feature extraction alone can match or surpass the performance of multi-scale methods, significantly reducing complexity. To comprehensively explore single-scale feature potential in underwater enhancement, we propose an innovative Single-Scale Decomposition Network (SSD-Net). This architecture introduces an asymmetrical decomposition mechanism that disentangles input image into clean layer along with degradation layer. The former contains scene-intrinsic information and the latter encodes medium-induced interference. It uniquely combines CNN's local feature extraction capabilities with Transformer's global modeling strengths through two core modules: 1) Parallel Feature Decomposition Block (PFDB), implementing dual-branch feature space decoupling via efficient attention operations and adaptive sparse transformer; 2) Bidirectional Feature Communication Block (BFCB), enabling cross-layer residual interactions for complementary feature mining and fusion. This synergistic design preserves feature decomposition independence while establishing dynamic cross-layer information pathways, effectively enhancing degradation decoupling capacity.

Title: The State Of TTS: A Case Study with Human Fooling Rates
Authors: Praveen Srinivasa Varadhan, Sherry Thomas, Sai Teja M. S., Suvrat Bhooshan, Mitesh M. Khapra
Abstract: While subjective evaluations in recent years indicate rapid progress in TTS, can current TTS systems truly pass a human deception test in a Turing-like evaluation? We introduce Human Fooling Rate (HFR), a metric that directly measures how often machine-generated speech is mistaken for human. Our large-scale evaluation of open-source and commercial TTS models reveals critical insights: (i) CMOS-based claims of human parity often fail under deception testing, (ii) TTS progress should be benchmarked on datasets where human speech achieves high HFRs, as evaluating against monotonous or less expressive reference samples sets a low bar, (iii) Commercial models approach human deception in zero-shot settings, while open-source systems still struggle with natural conversational speech; (iv) Fine-tuning on high-quality data improves realism but does not fully bridge the gap. Our findings underscore the need for more realistic, human-centric evaluations alongside existing subjective tests.

Title: Optimizing Microgrid Composition for Sustainable Data Centers
Authors: Julius Irion, Philipp Wiesner, Jonathan Bader, Odej Kao
Abstract: As computing energy demand continues to grow and electrical grid infrastructure struggles to keep pace, an increasing number of data centers are being planned with colocated microgrids that integrate on-site renewable generation and energy storage. However, while existing research has examined the tradeoffs between operational and embodied carbon emissions in the context of renewable energy certificates, there is a lack of tools to assess how the sizing and composition of microgrid components affects long-term sustainability and power reliability. In this paper, we present a novel optimization framework that extends the computing and energy system co-simulator Vessim with detailed renewable energy generation models from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) System Advisor Model (SAM). Our framework simulates the interaction between computing workloads, on-site renewable production, and energy storage, capturing both operational and embodied emissions. We use a multi-horizon black-box optimization to explore efficient microgrid compositions and enable operators to make more informed decisions when planning energy systems for data centers.

Title: Challenges in Applying Variational Quantum Algorithms to Dynamic Satellite Network Routing
Authors: Phuc Hao Do, Tran Duc Le
Abstract: Applying near-term variational quantum algorithms to the problem of dynamic satellite network routing represents a promising direction for quantum computing. In this work, we provide a critical evaluation of two major approaches: static quantum optimizers such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for offline route computation, and Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) methods for online decision-making. Using ideal, noise-free simulations, we find that these algorithms face significant challenges. Specifically, static optimizers are unable to solve even a classically easy 4-node shortest path problem due to the complexity of the optimization landscape. Likewise, a basic QRL agent based on policy gradient methods fails to learn a useful routing strategy in a dynamic 8-node environment and performs no better than random actions. These negative findings highlight key obstacles that must be addressed before quantum algorithms can offer real advantages in communication networks. We discuss the underlying causes of these limitations, including barren plateaus and learning instability, and suggest future research directions to overcome them.

Title: A Foundation Model for DAS Signal Recognition and Visual Prompt Tuning of the Pre-trained Model for Downstream Tasks
Authors: Kun Gui, Hongliang Ren, Shang Shi, Jin Lu, Changqiu Yu, Quanjun Cao, Guomin Gu, Qi Xuan
Abstract: Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology finds growing applications across various domains. However, data distribution disparities due to heterogeneous sensing environments pose challenges for data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) models, limiting cross-domain generalization and facing a shortage of labeled training data. To address these issues, this study proposes a foundational model for DAS signal recognition based on a Masked Autoencoder, named MAEPD. The MAEPD model is pretrained on a dataset of 635,860 samples, encompassing DAS gait spatiotemporal signals, 2D GASF images for perimeter security, 2D time-frequency images for pipeline leakage, and open-dataset signals including whale vocalizations and seismic activities, using a self-supervised mask reconstruction task to capture deep semantic features of DAS signals. Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is employed for downstream recognition tasks. This method freezes the pretrained backbone parameters and fine-tunes only a small set of learnable visual prompt vectors inserted into the Transformer encoder layers. Experiments on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Super platform validate MAEPD using indoor gait recognition as a downstream task. The VPT-Deep approach achieves a classification accuracy of 96.94% with just 0.322% of parameters fine-tuned, surpassing the traditional Full Fine Tuning (FFT) method by 0.61% and reducing training time by 45%. The model also exhibits robust performance in pipeline leakage detection, confirming the generality, efficiency, and scalability of MAEPD as a foundational model. This approach offers a novel paradigm for addressing the limited generalization of signal recognition models in the DAS domain.

Title: Continual Multiple Instance Learning for Hematologic Disease Diagnosis
Authors: Zahra Ebrahimi, Raheleh Salehi, Nassir Navab, Carsten Marr, Ario Sadafi
Abstract: The dynamic environment of laboratories and clinics, with streams of data arriving on a daily basis, requires regular updates of trained machine learning models for consistent performance. Continual learning is supposed to help train models without catastrophic forgetting. However, state-of-the-art methods are ineffective for multiple instance learning (MIL), which is often used in single-cell-based hematologic disease diagnosis (e.g., leukemia detection). Here, we propose the first continual learning method tailored specifically to MIL. Our method is rehearsal-based over a selection of single instances from various bags. We use a combination of the instance attention score and distance from the bag mean and class mean vectors to carefully select which samples and instances to store in exemplary sets from previous tasks, preserving the diversity of the data. Using the real-world input of one month of data from a leukemia laboratory, we study the effectiveness of our approach in a class incremental scenario, comparing it to well-known continual learning methods. We show that our method considerably outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing the first continual learning approach for MIL. This enables the adaptation of models to shifting data distributions over time, such as those caused by changes in disease occurrence or underlying genetic alterations.

Title: Reliable and Real-Time Highway Trajectory Planning via Hybrid Learning-Optimization Frameworks
Authors: Yujia Lu, Chong Wei, Lu Ma
Abstract: Autonomous highway driving presents a high collision risk due to fast-changing environments and limited reaction time, necessitating reliable and efficient trajectory planning. This paper proposes a hybrid trajectory planning framework that integrates the adaptability of learning-based methods with the formal safety guarantees of optimization-based approaches. The framework features a two-layer architecture: an upper layer employing a graph neural network (GNN) trained on real-world highway data to predict human-like longitudinal velocity profiles, and a lower layer utilizing path optimization formulated as a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem. The primary contribution is the lower-layer path optimization model, which introduces a linear approximation of discretized vehicle geometry to substantially reduce computational complexity, while enforcing strict spatiotemporal non-overlapping constraints to formally guarantee collision avoidance throughout the planning horizon. Experimental results demonstrate that the planner generates highly smooth, collision-free trajectories in complex real-world emergency scenarios, achieving success rates exceeding 97% with average planning times of 54 ms, thereby confirming real-time capability.

Title: Tradeoff Between the Number of Transmitted Molecules and the BER Performance in Molecular Communication between Bionanosensors
Authors: Dongliang Jing, Linjuan Li, Lin Lin, Andrew W. Eckford
Abstract: In the domain of molecular communication (MC), information is conveyed through the characteristics of molecules transmitted between the transmitter and the receiver bionanosensors via propagation. The constrained size of the transmitter imposes limitations on its storage capacity, constraining the number of available molecules for transmission, with a resulting effect on communication reliability. This paper primarily focuses on achieving an equilibrium between the number of transmitted molecules and the bit error rate (BER) performance. To this end, we first analyze the relationship between the number of transmitted molecules and the BER performance. Subsequently, a balancing function that considers both the number of transmitted molecules and the BER performance is introduced, taking into account the molecules' respective weights. Given the difference in magnitude between the number of transmitted molecules and the BER, these parameters are normalized to facilitate analysis. Subsequently, a Gradient Descent Algorithm is employed to determine the optimal number of transmitted molecules, aiming to achieve the optimal equilibrium in the analyzed MC system. Theoretical and simulation results are provided, substantiating that the optimal outcome indeed establishes an ideal balance between the number of transmitted molecules and the BER.

Title: Energy-Efficient Hybrid Beamfocusing for Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communication
Authors: Wenhao Hu, Zhenyao He, Wei Xu, Yongming Huang, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng, Naofal Al-Dhahir
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a pivotal component of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, leveraging high-frequency bands and massive multiple-input multiple-output (M-MIMO) to deliver both high-capacity communication and high-precision sensing. However, these technological advancements lead to significant near-field effects, while the implementation of M-MIMO \mbox{is associated with considerable} hardware costs and escalated power consumption. In this context, hybrid architecture designs emerge as both hardware-efficient and energy-efficient solutions. Motivated by these considerations, we investigate the design of energy-efficient hybrid beamfocusing for near-field ISAC under two distinct target scenarios, i.e., a point target and an extended target. Specifically, we first derive the closed-form CramÃ©r-Rao bound (CRB) of joint angle-and-distance estimation for the point target and the Bayesian CRB (BCRB) of the target response matrix for the extended target. Building on these derived results, we minimize the CRB/BCRB by optimizing the transmit beamfocusing, while ensuring the energy efficiency (EE) of the system and the quality-of-service (QoS) for communication users. To address the resulting \mbox{nonconvex problems}, we first utilize a penalty-based successive convex approximation technique with a fully-digital beamformer to obtain a suboptimal solution. Then, we propose an efficient alternating \mbox{optimization} algorithm to design the analog-and-digital beamformer. \mbox{Simulation} results indicate that joint distance-and-angle estimation is feasible in the near-field region. However, the adopted hybrid architectures inevitably degrade the accuracy of distance estimation, compared with their fully-digital counterparts. Furthermore, enhancements in system EE would compromise the accuracy of target estimation, unveiling a nontrivial tradeoff.

Title: Perch 2.0: The Bittern Lesson for Bioacoustics
Authors: Bart van MerriÃ«nboer, Vincent Dumoulin, Jenny Hamer, Lauren Harrell, Andrea Burns, Tom Denton
Abstract: Perch is a performant pre-trained model for bioacoustics. It was trained in supervised fashion, providing both off-the-shelf classification scores for thousands of vocalizing species as well as strong embeddings for transfer learning. In this new release, Perch 2.0, we expand from training exclusively on avian species to a large multi-taxa dataset. The model is trained with self-distillation using a prototype-learning classifier as well as a new source-prediction training criterion. Perch 2.0 obtains state-of-the-art performance on the BirdSet and BEANS benchmarks. It also outperforms specialized marine models on marine transfer learning tasks, despite having almost no marine training data. We present hypotheses as to why fine-grained species classification is a particularly robust pre-training task for bioacoustics.

Title: Phase-Pole-Free Images and Smooth Coil Sensitivity Maps by Regularized Nonlinear Inversion
Authors: Moritz Blumenthal, Martin Uecker
Abstract: Purpose: Phase singularities are a common problem in image reconstruction with auto-calibrated sensitivities due to an inherent ambiguity of the estimation problem. The purpose of this work is to develop a method for detecting and correcting phase poles in non-linear inverse (NLINV) reconstruction of MR images and coil sensitivity maps. Methods: Phase poles are detected in individual coil sensitivity maps by computing the curl in each pixel. A weighted average of the curl in each coil is computed to detect phase poles. Phase pole detection and correction is then integrated into the iteratively regularized Gauss-Newton method of the NLINV algorithm, which then avoid phase singularities in the reconstructed images. The method is evaluated for reconstruction of accelerated Cartesian MPRAGE data of the brain and interactive radial real-time MRI of the human heart. Results: Phase poles are reliably removed in NLINV reconstructions for both applications. NLINV with phase pole correction can reliably and efficiently estimate coil sensitivity profiles free from singularities even from very small ($7\times7$) auto-calibration (AC) regions. Conclusion: NLINV emerges as an efficient and reliable tool for image reconstruction and coil sensitivity estimation in challenging MRI applications.

Title: Layers of a City: Network-Based Insights into San Diego's Transportation Ecosystem
Authors: Matthew Chan, Steve Sharp, Jiajian Zhu, Raman Ebrahimi
Abstract: Analyzing the structure and function of urban transportation networks is critical for enhancing mobility, equity, and resilience. This paper leverages network science to conduct a multi-modal analysis of San Diego's transportation system. We construct a multi-layer graph using data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS), representing driving, walking, and public transit layers. By integrating thousands of Points of Interest (POIs), we analyze network accessibility, structure, and resilience through centrality measures, community detection, and a proposed metric for walkability. Our analysis reveals a system defined by a stark core-periphery divide. We find that while the urban core is well-integrated, 30.3% of POIs are isolated from public transit within a walkable distance, indicating significant equity gaps in suburban and rural access. Centrality analysis highlights the driving network's over-reliance on critical freeways as bottlenecks, suggesting low network resilience, while confirming that San Diego is not a broadly walkable city. Furthermore, community detection demonstrates that transportation mode dictates the scale of mobility, producing compact, local clusters for walking and broad, regional clusters for driving. Collectively, this work provides a comprehensive framework for diagnosing urban mobility systems, offering quantitative insights that can inform targeted interventions to improve transportation equity and infrastructure resilience in San Diego.

Title: Adaptive Coded Federated Learning: Privacy Preservation and Straggler Mitigation
Authors: Chengxi Li, Ming Xiao, Mikael Skoglund
Abstract: In this article, we address the problem of federated learning in the presence of stragglers. For this problem, a coded federated learning framework has been proposed, where the central server aggregates gradients received from the non-stragglers and gradient computed from a privacy-preservation global coded dataset to mitigate the negative impact of the stragglers. However, when aggregating these gradients, fixed weights are consistently applied across iterations, neglecting the generation process of the global coded dataset and the dynamic nature of the trained model over iterations. This oversight may result in diminished learning performance. To overcome this drawback, we propose a new method named adaptive coded federated learning (ACFL). In ACFL, before the training, each device uploads a coded local dataset with additive noise to the central server to generate a global coded dataset under privacy preservation requirements. During each iteration of the training, the central server aggregates the gradients received from the non-stragglers and the gradient computed from the global coded dataset, where an adaptive policy for varying the aggregation weights is designed. Under this policy, we optimize the performance in terms of privacy and learning, where the learning performance is analyzed through convergence analysis and the privacy performance is characterized via mutual information differential privacy. Finally, we perform simulations to demonstrate the superiority of ACFL compared with the non-adaptive methods.

Title: Improving Sequential Market Coordination via Value-oriented Renewable Energy Forecasting
Authors: Yufan Zhang, Honglin Wen, Yuexin Bian, Yuanyuan Shi
Abstract: Large penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs) brings huge uncertainty into the electricity markets. The current deterministic clearing approach in the day-ahead (DA) market, where RESs participate based on expected production, has been criticized for causing a lack of coordination between the DA and real-time (RT) markets, leading to high overall operating costs. Previous works indicate that improving day-ahead RES entering quantities can significantly mitigate the drawbacks of deterministic clearing. In this work, we propose using a trained forecasting model, referred to as value-oriented forecasting, to determine RES Improved Entering Quantities (RIEQ) more efficiently during the operational phase. Unlike traditional models that minimize statistical forecasting errors, our approach trains model parameters to minimize the expected overall operating costs across both DA and RT markets. We derive the exact form of the loss function used for training, which becomes piecewise linear when market clearing is modeled by linear programs. Additionally, we provide the analytical gradient of the loss function with respect to the forecast, enabling an efficient training strategy. Numerical studies demonstrate that our forecasts significantly reduce overall operating costs for deterministic market clearing compared to conventional forecasts based on expected RES production.

Title: CityLight: A Neighborhood-inclusive Universal Model for Coordinated City-scale Traffic Signal Control
Authors: Jinwei Zeng, Chao Yu, Xinyi Yang, Wenxuan Ao, Qianyue Hao, Jian Yuan, Yong Li, Yu Wang, Huazhong Yang
Abstract: City-scale traffic signal control (TSC) involves thousands of heterogeneous intersections with varying topologies, making cooperative decision-making across intersections particularly challenging. Given the prohibitive computational cost of learning individual policies for each intersection, some researchers explore learning a universal policy to control each intersection in a decentralized manner, where the key challenge is to construct a universal representation method for heterogeneous intersections. However, existing methods are limited to universally representing information of heterogeneous ego intersections, neglecting the essential representation of influence from their heterogeneous neighbors. Universally incorporating neighborhood information is nontrivial due to the intrinsic complexity of traffic flow interactions, as well as the challenge of modeling collective influences from neighbor intersections. To address these challenges, we propose CityLight, which learns a universal policy based on representations obtained with two major modules: a Neighbor Influence Encoder to explicitly model neighbor's influence with specified traffic flow relation and connectivity to the ego intersection; a Neighbor Influence Aggregator to attentively aggregate the influence of neighbors based on their mutual competitive relations. Extensive experiments on five city-scale datasets, ranging from 97 to 13,952 intersections, confirm the efficacy of CityLight, with an average throughput improvement of 11.68% and a lift of 22.59% for generalization.

Title: Reachset-Conformant System Identification
Authors: Laura LÃ¼tzow, Matthias Althoff
Abstract: Formal verification techniques play a pivotal role in ensuring the safety of complex cyber-physical systems. To transfer model-based verification results to the real world, we require that the measurements of the target system lie in the set of reachable outputs of the corresponding model, a property we refer to as reachset conformance. This paper is on automatically identifying those reachset-conformant models. While state-of-the-art reachset-conformant identification methods focus on linear state-space models, we generalize these methods to nonlinear state-space models and linear and nonlinear input-output models. Furthermore, our identification framework adapts to different levels of prior knowledge on the system dynamics. In particular, we identify the set of model uncertainties for white-box models, the parameters and the set of model uncertainties for gray-box models, and entire reachset-conformant black-box models from data. The robustness and efficacy of our framework are demonstrated in extensive numerical experiments using simulated and real-world data.

Title: SINDyG: Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems from Graph-Structured Data, with Applications to Stuart-Landau Oscillator Networks
Authors: Mohammad Amin Basiri, Sina Khanmohammadi
Abstract: The combination of machine learning (ML) and sparsity-promoting techniques is enabling direct extraction of governing equations from data, revolutionizing computational modeling in diverse fields of science and engineering. The discovered dynamical models could be used to address challenges in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, epidemiology, and beyond. However, most existing sparse identification methods for discovering dynamical systems treat the whole system as one without considering the interactions between subsystems. As a result, such models are not able to capture small changes in the emergent system behavior. To address this issue, we developed a new method called Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems from Graph-structured data (SINDyG), which incorporates the network structure into sparse regression to identify model parameters that explain the underlying network dynamics. We tested our proposed method using several case studies of neuronal dynamics, where we modeled the macroscopic oscillation of a population of neurons using the extended Stuart-Landau (SL) equation and utilize the SINDyG method to identify the underlying nonlinear dynamics. Our extensive computational experiments validate the improved accuracy and simplicity of discovered network dynamics when compared to the original SINDy approach. The proposed graph-informed penalty can be easily integrated with other symbolic regression algorithms, enhancing model interpretability and performance by incorporating network structure into the regression process.

Title: Dynamic Input Mapping Inversion to Eliminate Algebraic Loops in Hydraulic Actuator Control
Authors: Alessio Dallabona, Patrik Schermann, Mogens Blanke, Dimitrios Papageorgiou
Abstract: The application of nonlinear control schemes to electro-hydraulic actuators often requires several alterations in the design of the controllers during their implementation. This is to overcome challenges that frequently arise in such control algorithms owing to model nonlinearities. Moreover, advanced control solutions for this type of systems often introduce input algebraic loops that pose significant design and tuning difficulties. Conventional methods to avoid such loops introduce chatter, which considerably degrade tracking performance and has oil degradation and wear as side effects. This study presents a nonlinear control architecture for hydraulic actuators that comprises low-complexity modules that facilitate robust high performance in tracking and avoids the drawbacks of chatter. The salient feature is a dynamic input-mapping inversion module that avoids algebraic loops in the control input and is followed by dedicated position control. The stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed using arguments from Lyapunov theory for cascaded non-autonomous nonlinear systems. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is evaluated on a high-fidelity simulator of a wind turbine pitch system, and validated on a full-scale laboratory setup that includes a hydraulic pitch system and blade bearing. Appropriate quantitative metrics are used to evaluate the closed-loop system performance in comparison to a state-of-the-art nonlinear design.

Title: BlurryScope enables compact, cost-effective scanning microscopy for HER2 scoring using deep learning on blurry images
Authors: Michael John Fanous, Christopher Michael Seybold, Hanlong Chen, Nir Pillar, Aydogan Ozcan
Abstract: We developed a rapid scanning optical microscope, termed "BlurryScope", that leverages continuous image acquisition and deep learning to provide a cost-effective and compact solution for automated inspection and analysis of tissue sections. This device offers comparable speed to commercial digital pathology scanners, but at a significantly lower price point and smaller size/weight. Using BlurryScope, we implemented automated classification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) scores on motion-blurred images of immunohistochemically (IHC) stained breast tissue sections, achieving concordant results with those obtained from a high-end digital scanning microscope. Using a test set of 284 unique patient cores, we achieved testing accuracies of 79.3% and 89.7% for 4-class (0, 1+, 2+, 3+) and 2-class (0/1+, 2+/3+) HER2 classification, respectively. BlurryScope automates the entire workflow, from image scanning to stitching and cropping, as well as HER2 score classification.

Title: DGAR: A Unified Domain Generalization Framework for RF-Based Human Activity Recognition
Authors: Junshuo Liu, Xin Shi, Yunchuan Zhang, Yinhao Ge, Robert C. Qiu
Abstract: Radio-frequency (RF)-based human activity recognition (HAR) provides a contactless and privacy-preserving solution for monitoring human behavior in applications such as astronaut extravehicular activity monitoring, human-autonomy collaborative cockpit, and unmanned aerial vehicle surveillance. However, real-world deployments usually face the challenge of domain knowledge shifts arising from inter-subject variability, heterogeneous physical environments, and unseen activity patterns, resulting in significant performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose DGAR, a domain-generalized activity recognition framework that learns transferable representations without collecting data from the target domain. DGAR integrates instance-adaptive feature modulation with cross-domain distribution alignment to enhance both personalization and generalization. Specifically, it incorporates a squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block to extract salient spatiotemporal features and employs correlation alignment to mitigate inter-domain discrepancies. Extensive experiments on public RF-based datasets -- HUST-HAR, Lab-LFM, and Office-LFM -- demonstrate that DGAR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 5.81% improvement in weighted F1-score. The empirical results substantiate the generalization capability of DGAR in real-time RF sensing across dynamic scenarios.

Title: ALADIN-$Î²$: A Distributed Optimization Algorithm for Solving MPCC Problems
Authors: Yifei Wang, Shuting Wu, Genke Yang, Jian Chu, Apostolos I. Rikos, Xu Du
Abstract: Mathematical Programs with Complementarity Constraints (MPCC) are critical in various real-world applications but notoriously challenging due to non-smoothness and degeneracy from complementarity constraints. The $\ell_1$-Exact Penalty-Barrier enhanced \texttt{IPOPT} improves performance and robustness by introducing additional inequality constraints and decision variables. However, this comes at the cost of increased computational complexity due to the higher dimensionality and additional constraints introduced in the centralized formulation. To mitigate this, we propose a distributed structure-splitting reformulation that decomposes these inequality constraints and auxiliary variables into independent sub-problems. Furthermore, we introduce Augmented Lagrangian Alternating Direction Inexact Newton (ALADIN)-$\beta$, a novel approach that integrates the $\ell_1$-Exact Penalty-Barrier method with ALADIN to efficiently solve the distributed reformulation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that even without a globalization strategy, the proposed distributed approach achieves fast convergence while maintaining high precision.

Title: CostFilter-AD: Enhancing Anomaly Detection through Matching Cost Filtering
Authors: Zhe Zhang, Mingxiu Cai, Hanxiao Wang, Gaochang Wu, Tianyou Chai, Xiatian Zhu
Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) seeks to localize the anomaly mask of an input image with respect to normal samples. Either by reconstructing normal counterparts (reconstruction-based) or by learning an image feature embedding space (embedding-based), existing approaches fundamentally rely on image-level or feature-level matching to derive anomaly scores. Often, such a matching process is inaccurate yet overlooked, leading to sub-optimal detection. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of cost filtering, borrowed from classical matching tasks, such as depth and flow estimation, into the UAD problem. We call this approach {\em CostFilter-AD}. Specifically, we first construct a matching cost volume between the input and normal samples, comprising two spatial dimensions and one matching dimension that encodes potential matches. To refine this, we propose a cost volume filtering network, guided by the input observation as an attention query across multiple feature layers, which effectively suppresses matching noise while preserving edge structures and capturing subtle anomalies. Designed as a generic post-processing plug-in, CostFilter-AD can be integrated with either reconstruction-based or embedding-based methods. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA benchmarks validate the generic benefits of CostFilter-AD for both single- and multi-class UAD tasks. Code and models will be released at this https URL.

Title: Quantum-Enhanced Power Flow and Optimal Power Flow based on Combinatorial Reformulation
Authors: Zeynab Kaseb, Matthias Moller, Peter Palensky, Pedro P. Vergara
Abstract: This study introduces the Adiabatic Quantum Power Flow (AQPF) and Adiabatic Quantum Optimal Power Flow (AQOPF) algorithms to solve power flow (PF) and optimal power flow (OPF) problems, respectively. These algorithms utilize a novel combinatorial optimization reformulation of classical PF and OPF problems, and hence, enable their implementation on Ising machines, e.g., quantum and quantum-inspired hardware. The experiments are conducted on standard test cases ranging from 4-bus to 1354-bus systems, using D-Wave's Advantage system (QA), its hybrid quantum-classical solver (HA), as well as the third-generation Digital Annealer (DAv3) and Quantum-Inspired Integrated Optimization software (QIIO) developed by Fujitsu. The annealers are systematically evaluated based on: (i) full and partitioned formulations, (ii) ability to handle ill-conditioned cases, and (iii) scalability. The results are benchmarked against the Newton-Raphson numerical method (NR) and suggest that AQPF and AQOPF can serve as effective solvers or complementary tools to classical methods to address unsolved challenges in large-scale modern power systems.

Title: UnMix-NeRF: Spectral Unmixing Meets Neural Radiance Fields
Authors: Fabian Perez, Sara Rojas, Carlos Hinojosa, Hoover Rueda-ChacÃ³n, Bernard Ghanem
Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based segmentation methods focus on object semantics and rely solely on RGB data, lacking intrinsic material properties. This limitation restricts accurate material perception, which is crucial for robotics, augmented reality, simulation, and other applications. We introduce UnMix-NeRF, a framework that integrates spectral unmixing into NeRF, enabling joint hyperspectral novel view synthesis and unsupervised material segmentation. Our method models spectral reflectance via diffuse and specular components, where a learned dictionary of global endmembers represents pure material signatures, and per-point abundances capture their distribution. For material segmentation, we use spectral signature predictions along learned endmembers, allowing unsupervised material clustering. Additionally, UnMix-NeRF enables scene editing by modifying learned endmember dictionaries for flexible material-based appearance manipulation. Extensive experiments validate our approach, demonstrating superior spectral reconstruction and material segmentation to existing methods. Project page: this https URL.

Title: ContextASR-Bench: A Massive Contextual Speech Recognition Benchmark
Authors: He Wang, Linhan Ma, Dake Guo, Xiong Wang, Lei Xie, Jin Xu, Junyang Lin
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has been extensively investigated, yet prior benchmarks have largely focused on assessing the acoustic robustness of ASR models, leaving evaluations of their linguistic capabilities relatively underexplored. This largely stems from the limited parameter sizes and training corpora of conventional ASR models, leaving them with insufficient world knowledge, which is crucial for accurately recognizing named entities across diverse domains. For instance, drug and treatment names in medicine or specialized technical terms in engineering. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) and corresponding Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have markedly enhanced the visibility of advanced context modeling and general artificial intelligence capabilities. Leveraging LLMs, we envision a unified system capable of robust speech recognition across diverse real-world domains, yet existing benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating this objective. To address this gap, we propose ContextASR-Bench: a comprehensive, large-scale benchmark designed to assess the linguistic competence of ASR systems using corpora that feature numerous named entities across multiple domains. It encompasses up to 40,000 data entries with more than 300,000 named entities across over 10 domains. Beyond the audio and its transcription, each sample provides the domain it belongs to and a list of named entities it contains, which are referred to as the context. Based on this, we introduce three evaluation modes to assess how effectively models can exploit such context to improve ASR accuracy. Extensive evaluation on ContextASR-Bench highlights that LALMs outperform conventional ASR models by a large margin thanks to the strong world knowledge and context modeling of LLMs, yet there remains ample room for further improvement. The dataset and evaluation code have been released.

Title: Advantages of Feedback in Distributed Data-Gathering for Accurate and Power-Efficient State-Estimation
Authors: Hyeongmin Choe, SooJean Han
Abstract: In distributed target-tracking sensor networks, efficient data gathering methods are necessary to save communication resources and assure information accuracy. This paper proposes a Feedback (FB) distributed data-gathering method which lets the central unit feed information back to the mobile sensors; each sensor then uses it to cancel redundant transmissions and reduce communication congestion. We rigorously compare its performance, in terms of mean-squared error (MSE) and cost of power per sensor, against more conventional Non-Feedback (NF) architectures by evaluating conditions of feasibility and advantage under different architecture specifications (e.g., communication delay rate, power cost rate, maximum back-off time, sampling period, observation noise). Here, we defined the advantage as the performance gain achieved by FB over NF, while FB is said to be feasible if the advantage region is nonempty. Our theoretical analyses show that the feasibility of FB depends more on the communication power cost, while the advantage depends on the sensors' propagation delay per transmission interval; we derive concrete conditions under which these outcomes hold. Using extensive numerical simulations under a variety of settings, we confirm the accuracy of the derived conditions, and show that our theoretical results hold even for more complex scenarios where the simplifying assumptions no longer hold.

Title: Privacy-Preserving Fusion for Multi-Sensor Systems Under Multiple Packet Dropouts
Authors: Jie Huang, Jason J. R. Liu, Xiao He
Abstract: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are critical components in modern cyber-physical systems, enabling efficient data collection and fusion through spatially distributed sensors. However, the inherent risks of eavesdropping and packet dropouts in such networks pose significant challenges to secure state estimation. In this paper, we address the privacy-preserving fusion estimation (PPFE) problem for multi-sensor systems under multiple packet dropouts and eavesdropping attacks. To mitigate these issues, we propose a distributed encoding-based privacy-preserving mechanism (PPM) within a control-theoretic framework, ensuring data privacy during transmission while maintaining the performance of legitimate state estimation. A centralized fusion filter is developed, accounting for the coupling effects of packet dropouts and the encoding-based PPM. Boundedness conditions for the legitimate user's estimation error covariance are derived via a modified algebraic Riccati equation. Additionally, by demonstrating the divergence of the eavesdropper's mean estimation error, the proposed PPFE algorithm's data confidentiality is rigorously analyzed. Simulation results for an Internet-based three-tank system validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, highlighting its potential to enhance privacy without compromising estimation accuracy.

Title: Edge Agentic AI Framework for Autonomous Network Optimisation in O-RAN
Authors: Abdelaziz Salama, Zeinab Nezami, Mohammed M. H. Qazzaz, Maryam Hafeez, Syed Ali Raza Zaidi
Abstract: The deployment of AI agents within legacy Radio Access Network (RAN) infrastructure poses significant safety and reliability challenges for future 6G networks. This paper presents a novel Edge AI framework for autonomous network optimisation in Open RAN environments, addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1) a persona-based multi-tools architecture enabling distributed, context-aware decision-making; (2) proactive anomaly detection agent powered by traffic predictive tool; and (3) a safety, aligned reward mechanism that balances performance with operational stability. Integrated into the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), our framework leverages multimodal data fusion, including network KPIs, a traffic prediction model, and external information sources, to anticipate and respond to dynamic network conditions. Extensive evaluation using realistic 5G scenarios demonstrates that the edge framework achieves zero network outages under high-stress conditions, compared to 8.4% for traditional fixed-power networks and 3.3% for large language model (LLM) agent-based approaches, while maintaining near real-time responsiveness and consistent QoS. These results establish that, when equipped with the right tools and contextual awareness, AI agents can be safely and effectively deployed in critical network infrastructure, laying the framework for intelligent and autonomous 5G and beyond network operations.

Title: GR-Gaussian: Graph-Based Radiative Gaussian Splatting for Sparse-View CT Reconstruction
Authors: Yikuang Yuluo, Yue Ma, Kuan Shen, Tongtong Jin, Wang Liao, Yangpu Ma, Fuquan Wang
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising approach for CT reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on the average gradient magnitude of points within the view, often leading to severe needle-like artifacts under sparse-view conditions. To address this challenge, we propose GR-Gaussian, a graph-based 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that suppresses needle-like artifacts and improves reconstruction accuracy under sparse-view conditions. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a Denoised Point Cloud Initialization Strategy that reduces initialization errors and accelerates convergence; and (2) a Pixel-Graph-Aware Gradient Strategy that refines gradient computation using graph-based density differences, improving splitting accuracy and density representation. Experiments on X-3D and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of GR-Gaussian, achieving PSNR improvements of 0.67 dB and 0.92 dB, and SSIM gains of 0.011 and 0.021. These results highlight the applicability of GR-Gaussian for accurate CT reconstruction under challenging sparse-view conditions.

Title: Environmental Sound Classification on An Embedded Hardware Platform
Authors: Gabriel Bibbo, Arshdeep Singh, Mark D. Plumbley
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance in various audio classification tasks. However, their real-time deployment remains a challenge on resource constrained devices such as embedded systems. In this paper, we analyze how the performance of large-scale pre-trained audio neural networks designed for audio pattern recognition changes when deployed on a hardware such as a Raspberry Pi. We empirically study the role of CPU temperature, microphone quality and audio signal volume on performance. Our experiments reveal that the continuous CPU usage results in an increased temperature that can trigger an automated slowdown mechanism in the Raspberry Pi, impacting inference latency. The quality of a microphone, specifically with affordable devices such as the Google AIY Voice Kit, and audio signal volume, all affect the system performance. In the course of our investigation, we encounter substantial complications linked to library compatibility and the unique processor architecture requirements of the Raspberry Pi, making the process less straightforward compared to conventional computers (PCs). Our observations, while presenting challenges, pave the way for future researchers to develop more compact machine learning models, design heat-dissipative hardware, and select appropriate microphones when AI models are deployed for real-time applications on edge devices.

Title: Cell-Free Massive MIMO SWIPT with Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces
Authors: Thien Duc Hua, Mohammadali Mohammadi, Hien Quoc Ngo, Michail Matthaiou
Abstract: We investigate the integration of beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RISs) into cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems to enhance simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). To simultaneously support two groups of users-energy receivers (ERs) and information receivers (IRs)-without sacrificing time-frequency resources, a subset of access points (APs) is dedicated to serving ERs with the aid of a BD-RIS, while the remaining APs focus on supporting IRs. A protective partial zero-forcing precoding technique is implemented at the APs to manage the non-coherent interference between the ERs and IRs. Subsequently, closed-form expressions for the spectral efficiency of the IRs and the average sum of harvested energy (HE) at the ERs are leveraged to formulate a comprehensive optimization problem. This problem jointly optimizes the AP selection, AP power control, and scattering matrix design at the BD-RIS, all based on long-term statistical channel state information. This challenging problem is then effectively transformed into more tractable forms. To solve these sub-problems, efficient algorithms are proposed, including a heuristic search for the scattering matrix design, as well as successive convex approximation and deep reinforcement learning methods for the joint AP mode selection and power control design. Numerical results show that a BD-RIS with a group-or fully-connected architecture achieves significant EH gains over the conventional diagonal RIS, especially delivering up to a 7-fold increase in the average sum of HE when a heuristic-based scattering matrix design is employed.

Title: Coded Kalman Filtering over MIMO Gaussian Channels with Feedback
Authors: Barron Han, Oron Sabag, Victoria Kostina, Babak Hassibi
Abstract: We consider the problem of remotely stabilizing a dynamical system. A sensor (encoder) co-located with the system communicates with a controller (decoder), whose goal is to stabilize the system, over a noisy communication channel with feedback. To accomplish this, the controller must estimate the system state with finite mean squared error (MSE). The vector-valued dynamical system state follows a Gauss-Markov law with additive control. The channel is a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with feedback. For such a source, a linear encoder, and a MIMO AWGN channel, the minimal MSE decoder is a Kalman filter. The parameters of the Kalman filter and the linear encoder can be jointly optimized, under a power constraint at the channel input. We term the resulting encoder-decoder pair a coded Kalman filter. We establish sufficient and necessary conditions for the coded Kalman filter to achieve a finite MSE in the real-time estimation of the state. For sufficiency, we introduce a coding scheme where each unstable mode of the state is estimated using the channel outputs of a single sub-channel. We prove a coinciding necessity condition when either the source or channel is scalar and present a matrix-algebraic condition which implies the condition is necessary in general. Finally, we provide a new counter-example demonstrating that linear codes are generally sub-optimal for coding over MIMO channels.

Title: A Value Based Parallel Update MCTS Method for Multi-Agent Cooperative Decision Making of Connected and Automated Vehicles
Authors: Ye Han, Lijun Zhang, Dejian Meng, Zhuang Zhang, Xingyu Hu, Songyu Weng
Abstract: To solve the problem of lateral and logitudinal joint decision-making of multi-vehicle cooperative driving for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), this paper proposes a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) method with parallel update for multi-agent Markov game with limited horizon and time discounted setting. By analyzing the parallel actions in the multi-vehicle joint action space in the partial-steady-state traffic flow, the parallel update method can quickly exclude potential dangerous actions, thereby increasing the search depth without sacrificing the search breadth. The proposed method is tested in a large number of randomly generated traffic flow. The experiment results show that the algorithm has good robustness and better performance than the SOTA reinforcement learning algorithms and heuristic methods. The vehicle driving strategy using the proposed algorithm shows rationality beyond human drivers, and has advantages in traffic efficiency and safety in the coordinating zone.

Title: Upsampling DINOv2 features for unsupervised vision tasks and weakly supervised materials segmentation
Authors: Ronan Docherty, Antonis Vamvakeros, Samuel J. Cooper
Abstract: The features of self-supervised vision transformers (ViTs) contain strong semantic and positional information relevant to downstream tasks like object localization and segmentation. Recent works combine these features with traditional methods like clustering, graph partitioning or region correlations to achieve impressive baselines without finetuning or training additional networks. We leverage upsampled features from ViT networks (e.g DINOv2) in two workflows: in a clustering based approach for object localization and segmentation, and paired with standard classifiers in weakly supervised materials segmentation. Both show strong performance on benchmarks, especially in weakly supervised segmentation where the ViT features capture complex relationships inaccessible to classical approaches. We expect the flexibility and generalizability of these features will both speed up and strengthen materials characterization, from segmentation to property-prediction.

Title: Efficient Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Regression for Spatial-Temporal Sensor Fusion
Authors: Keivan Faghih Niresi, Ismail Nejjar, Olga Fink
Abstract: The growing deployment of low-cost, distributed sensor networks in environmental and biomedical domains has enabled continuous, large-scale health monitoring. However, these systems often face challenges related to degraded data quality caused by sensor drift, noise, and insufficient calibration -- factors that limit their reliability in real-world applications. Traditional machine learning methods for sensor fusion and calibration rely on extensive feature engineering and struggle to capture spatial-temporal dependencies or adapt to distribution shifts across varying deployment conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method tailored for regression tasks. Our proposed method integrates effectively with Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks and leverages the alignment of perturbed inverse Gram matrices between source and target domains, drawing inspiration from Tikhonov regularization. This approach enables scalable and efficient domain adaptation without requiring labeled data in the target domain. We validate our novel method on real-world datasets from two distinct applications: air quality monitoring and EEG signal reconstruction. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance which paves the way for more robust and transferable sensor fusion models in both environmental and physiological contexts.

Title: Exponentially Consistent Nonparametric Linkage-Based Clustering of Data Sequences
Authors: Bhupender Singh, Ananth Ram Rajagopalan, Srikrishna Bhashyam
Abstract: In this paper, we consider nonparametric clustering of $M$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data sequences generated from {\em unknown} distributions. The distributions of the $M$ data sequences belong to $K$ underlying distribution clusters. Existing results on exponentially consistent nonparametric clustering algorithms, like single linkage-based (SLINK) clustering and $k$-medoids distribution clustering, assume that the maximum intra-cluster distance ($d_L$) is smaller than the minimum inter-cluster distance ($d_H$). First, in the fixed sample size (FSS) setting, we show that exponential consistency can be achieved for SLINK clustering under a less strict assumption, $d_I < d_H$, where $d_I$ is the maximum distance between any two sub-clusters of a cluster that partition the cluster. Note that $d_I < d_L$ in general. Thus, our results show that SLINK is exponentially consistent for a larger class of problems than previously known. In our simulations, we also identify examples where $k$-medoids clustering is unable to find the true clusters, but SLINK is exponentially consistent. Then, we propose a sequential clustering algorithm, named SLINK-SEQ, based on SLINK and prove that it is also exponentially consistent. Simulation results show that the SLINK-SEQ algorithm requires fewer expected number of samples than the FSS SLINK algorithm for the same probability of error.

Title: Are audio DeepFake detection models polyglots?
Authors: BartÅomiej Marek, Piotr Kawa, Piotr Syga
Abstract: Since the majority of audio DeepFake (DF) detection methods are trained on English-centric datasets, their applicability to non-English languages remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present a benchmark for the multilingual audio DF detection challenge by evaluating various adaptation strategies. Our experiments focus on analyzing models trained on English benchmark datasets, as well as intra-linguistic (same-language) and cross-linguistic adaptation approaches. Our results indicate considerable variations in detection efficacy, highlighting the difficulties of multilingual settings. We show that limiting the dataset to English negatively impacts the efficacy, while stressing the importance of the data in the target language.

Title: CCStereo: Audio-Visual Contextual and Contrastive Learning for Binaural Audio Generation
Authors: Yuanhong Chen, Kazuki Shimada, Christian Simon, Yukara Ikemiya, Takashi Shibuya, Yuki Mitsufuji
Abstract: Binaural audio generation (BAG) aims to convert monaural audio to stereo audio using visual prompts, requiring a deep understanding of spatial and semantic information. However, current models risk overfitting to room environments and lose fine-grained spatial details. In this paper, we propose a new audio-visual binaural generation model incorporating an audio-visual conditional normalisation layer that dynamically aligns the mean and variance of the target difference audio features using visual context, along with a new contrastive learning method to enhance spatial sensitivity by mining negative samples from shuffled visual features. We also introduce a cost-efficient way to utilise test-time augmentation in video data to enhance performance. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art generation accuracy on the FAIR-Play and MUSIC-Stereo benchmarks.

Title: AudioMiXR: Spatial Audio Object Manipulation with 6DoF for Sound Design in Augmented Reality
Authors: Brandon Woodard, Margarita Geleta, Joseph J. LaViola Jr., Andrea Fanelli, Rhonda Wilson
Abstract: We present AudioMiXR, an augmented reality (AR) interface intended to assess how users manipulate virtual audio objects situated in their physical space using six degrees of freedom (6DoF) deployed on a head-mounted display (Apple Vision Pro) for 3D sound design. Existing tools for 3D sound design are typically constrained to desktop displays, which may limit spatial awareness of mixing within the execution environment. Utilizing an XR HMD to create soundscapes may provide a real-time test environment for 3D sound design, as modern HMDs can provide precise spatial localization assisted by cross-modal interactions. However, there is no research on design guidelines specific to sound design with 6DoF in XR. To provide a first step toward identifying design-related research directions in this space, we conducted an exploratory study where we recruited 27 participants, consisting of expert and non-expert sound designers. The goal was to assess design lessons that can be used to inform future research venues in 3D sound design. We ran a within-subjects study where users designed both a music and cinematic soundscapes. After thematically analyzing participant data, we constructed two design lessons: (1) Proprioception for AR Sound Design, and (2) Balancing Audio-Visual Modalities in AR GUIs. Additionally, we provide application domains that can benefit most from 6DoF sound design based on our results. To expand on these insights, we conducted a second within-subjects study comparing AudioMiXR to a 2D panner baseline. Results show that AudioMiXR significantly improved usability (SUS), reduced frustration and mental workload (NASA-TLX), and enhanced creativity across all subscales. These findings demonstrate that 6DoF AR interaction yields measurable gains in user experience and creative output, positioning AudioMiXR as a promising foundation for future AR-based sound design tools.

Title: Silent Speech Sentence Recognition with Six-Axis Accelerometers using Conformer and CTC Algorithm
Authors: Yudong Xie, Zhifeng Han, Qinfan Xiao, Liwei Liang, Lu-Qi Tao, Tian-Ling Ren
Abstract: Silent speech interfaces (SSI) are being actively developed to assist individuals with communication impairments who have long suffered from daily hardships and a reduced quality of life. However, silent sentences are difficult to segment and recognize due to elision and linking. A novel silent speech sentence recognition method is proposed to convert the facial motion signals collected by six-axis accelerometers into transcribed words and sentences. A Conformer-based neural network with the Connectionist-Temporal-Classification algorithm is used to gain contextual understanding and translate the non-acoustic signals into words sequences, solely requesting the constituent words in the database. Test results show that the proposed method achieves a 97.17% accuracy in sentence recognition, surpassing the existing silent speech recognition methods with a typical accuracy of 85%-95%, and demonstrating the potential of accelerometers as an available SSI modality for high-accuracy silent speech sentence recognition.

Title: Adaptive Audio-Visual Speech Recognition via Matryoshka-Based Multimodal LLMs
Authors: Umberto Cappellazzo, Minsu Kim, Stavros Petridis
Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) leverages audio and visual modalities to improve robustness in noisy environments. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong performance in speech recognition, including AVSR. However, the long speech representations lead to high computational costs for LLMs. Prior methods compress inputs before feeding them to LLMs, but high compression often harms accuracy. To address this, we propose Llama-MTSK, the first Matryoshka-based Multimodal LLM for AVSR, which flexibly adapts audio-visual token allocation under varying compute constraints. Inspired by Matryoshka Representation Learning, our model encodes representations at multiple granularities with a single architecture, avoiding the need for separate models. For efficient fine-tuning, we introduce three LoRA-based strategies using global and scale-specific modules. Evaluations on major AVSR datasets show Llama-MTSK matches or outperforms models trained at fixed compression levels.

Title: SCAN-BEST: Sub-6GHz-Aided Near-field Beam Selection with Formal Reliability Guarantees
Authors: Weicao Deng, Binpu Shi, Min Li, Osvaldo Simeone
Abstract: As millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems adopt larger antenna arrays, near-field propagation becomes increasingly prominent, especially for users close to the transmitter. Traditional far-field beam training methods become inadequate, while near-field training faces the challenge of large codebooks due to the need to resolve both angular and distance domains. To reduce in-band training overhead, prior work has proposed to leverage the spatial-temporal congruence between sub-6 GHz (sub-6G) and mmWave channels to predict the best mmWave beam within a near-field codebook from sub-6G channel estimates. To cope with the uncertainty caused by sub-6G/mmWave differences, we introduce a novel Sub-6G Channel Aided Near-field BEam SelecTion (SCAN-BEST) framework that wraps around any beam predictor to produce candidate beam subset with formal suboptimality guarantees. The proposed SCAN-BEST builds on conformal risk control (CRC), and is calibrated offline using limited calibration data. Its performance guarantees apply even in the presence of statistical shifts between calibration and deployment. Numerical results validate the theoretical properties and efficiency of SCAN-BEST.

Title: Split the Yield, Share the Risk: Pricing, Hedging and Fixed rates in DeFi
Authors: Viraj Nadkarni, Pramod Viswanath
Abstract: We present the first formal treatment of \emph{yield tokenization}, a mechanism that decomposes yield-bearing assets into principal and yield components to facilitate risk transfer and price discovery in decentralized finance (DeFi). We propose a model that characterizes yield token dynamics using stochastic differential equations. We derive a no-arbitrage pricing framework for yield tokens, enabling their use in hedging future yield volatility and managing interest rate risk in decentralized lending pools. Taking DeFi lending as our focus, we show how both borrowers and lenders can use yield tokens to achieve optimal hedging outcomes and mitigate exposure to adversarial interest rate manipulation. Furthermore, we design automated market makers (AMMs) that incorporate a menu of bonding curves to aggregate liquidity from participants with heterogeneous risk preferences. This leads to an efficient and incentive-compatible mechanism for trading yield tokens and yield futures. Building on these foundations, we propose a modular \textit{fixed-rate} lending protocol that synthesizes on-chain yield token markets and lending pools, enabling robust interest rate discovery and enhancing capital efficiency. Our work provides the theoretical underpinnings for risk management and fixed-income infrastructure in DeFi, offering practical mechanisms for stable and sustainable yield markets.

Title: Iola Walker: A Mobile Footfall Detection System for Music Composition
Authors: William B James
Abstract: This paper is part of a larger music technology research project. this http URL The goal of this research is to find a method of materially enhancing music using hardware and software. Why might one want to do this, you might ask? Because if it was possible to create a new form of music that was preferred by listeners, that would be a great way for musicians to reclaim live musical performance from the digital advertising industry. This project is an initial iteration towards the broader research goal of promoting equitable human thriving in the music field. \par The project is dubbed "iola walker" in reference to a common polyrhythm, the hemiola. A listener goes for a walk, and the Iola Walker app detects their walking pace. Iola Walker picks up footfalls using a foot-mounted accelerometer, processing the signals in real time using a recurrent neural network in an android app. The android app outputs a midi event for each footfall. The iola walker player plays the version of the next music passage with underlying polyrhythms closest to the listener's walking pace, as determined by the composer. \par This paper documents the process of training the model to detect a walking listener's footfalls in real time. The model is trained on accelerometer data from an Mbient Labs foot-mounted IMU \cite{mbientlabs} at 200~Hz, with the ground truth for footfalls annotated by pressing the volume up button on the android device when the foot hits the ground. To collect training data, I walked around my neighborhood clicking the volume up button each time my foot hit the ground. I tried several methods for detecting footfalls in real time from sensor data, with the most success from an LSTM. Artifacts for this paper are available here: this https URL

Title: Can Sound Replace Vision in LLaVA With Token Substitution?
Authors: Ali Vosoughi, Jing Bi, Pinxin Liu, Yunlong Tang, Chenliang Xu
Abstract: What happens when we push audio-visual alignment to its absolute limits? To systematically investigate this question, we needed datasets with granular alignment quality annotations, but existing datasets treat alignment as binary, either synchronized or not. To address this limitation, we developed a comprehensive dataset featuring detailed alignment scores that reveal the hidden spectrum of audio-visual perceptual correspondence. Using these precise scores, we create "superaligned" representations by training exclusively on the most perfectly matched audio-visual pairs, then conduct our systematic investigation into how this extreme alignment transforms perceptual model behavior across retrieval and generation tasks. The encoders under study fall into two main groups consisting of image-centric encoders that were pretrained using visual modalities as intermediary hubs for connecting modalities, and text-centric encoders that were pretrained with direct audio-language alignment. We first measure the baseline performance of these encoders on two key tasks, namely cross-modal retrieval and text description generation in vision-language models. Subsequently, we realign all encoders with the CLIP space using highly coherent audio-visual data and observe the performance changes. Our findings reveal that the initial architectural type of the encoder determines how it responds to the alignment process. Image-centric encoders, which are inherently designed for alignment, demonstrate exceptional performance in cross-modal retrieval, but this intensive alignment causes compression of unique linguistic information and reduces the quality of their text description generation in vision-language models. In contrast, text-centric encoders, which possess stronger linguistic authenticity, are able to maintain a better balance between the two objectives.

Title: AV-SSAN: Audio-Visual Selective DoA Estimation through Explicit Multi-Band Semantic-Spatial Alignment
Authors: Yu Chen, Hongxu Zhu, Jiadong Wang, Kainan Chen, Xinyuan Qian
Abstract: Audio-visual sound source localization (AV-SSL) estimates the position of sound sources by fusing auditory and visual cues. Current AV-SSL methodologies typically require spatially-paired audio-visual data and cannot selectively localize specific target sources. To address these limitations, we introduce Cross-Instance Audio-Visual Localization (CI-AVL), a novel task that localizes target sound sources using visual prompts from different instances of the same semantic class. CI-AVL enables selective localization without spatially paired data. To solve this task, we propose AV-SSAN, a semantic-spatial alignment framework centered on a Multi-Band Semantic-Spatial Alignment Network (MB-SSA Net). MB-SSA Net decomposes the audio spectrogram into multiple frequency bands, aligns each band with semantic visual prompts, and refines spatial cues to estimate the direction-of-arrival (DoA). To facilitate this research, we construct VGGSound-SSL, a large-scale dataset comprising 13,981 spatial audio clips across 296 categories, each paired with visual prompts. AV-SSAN achieves a mean absolute error of 16.59 and an accuracy of 71.29%, significantly outperforming existing AV-SSL methods. Code and data will be public.

Title: SDBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark Suite for Speaker Diarization
Authors: Eduardo Pacheco, Atila Orhon, Berkin Durmus, Blaise Munyampirwa, Andrey Leonov
Abstract: Even state-of-the-art speaker diarization systems exhibit high variance in error rates across different datasets, representing numerous use cases and domains. Furthermore, comparing across systems requires careful application of best practices such as dataset splits and metric definitions to allow for apples-to-apples comparison. We propose SDBench (Speaker Diarization Benchmark), an open-source benchmark suite that integrates 13 diverse datasets with built-in tooling for consistent and fine-grained analysis of speaker diarization performance for various on-device and server-side systems. SDBench enables reproducible evaluation and easy integration of new systems over time. To demonstrate the efficacy of SDBench, we built SpeakerKit, an inference efficiency-focused system built on top of Pyannote v3. SDBench enabled rapid execution of ablation studies that led to SpeakerKit being 9.6x faster than Pyannote v3 while achieving comparable error rates. We benchmark 6 state-of-the-art systems including Deepgram, AWS Transcribe, and Pyannote AI API, revealing important trade-offs between accuracy and speed.

Title: Bob's Confetti: Phonetic Memorization Attacks in Music and Video Generation
Authors: Jaechul Roh, Zachary Novack, Yuefeng Peng, Niloofar Mireshghallah, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick, Amir Houmansadr
Abstract: Memorization in generative models extends far beyond verbatim text reproduction--it manifests through non-literal patterns, semantic associations, and surprisingly, across modalities in transcript-conditioned generation tasks such as Lyrics-to-Song (L2S) and Text-to-Video (T2V) models. We reveal a new class of cross-modality memorization where models trained on these tasks leak copyrighted content through indirect, phonetic pathways invisible to traditional text-based analysis. In this work, we introduce Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), an attack that replaces iconic phrases with homophonic alternatives--e.g., "mom's spaghetti" becomes "Bob's confetti"--preserving the acoustic form while largely changing semantic content. We demonstrate that models can be prompted to regurgitate memorized songs using phonetically similar but semantically unrelated lyrics. Despite the semantic drift, black-box models like SUNO and open-source models like YuE generate outputs that are strikingly similar to the original songs--melodically, rhythmically, and vocally--achieving high scores on AudioJudge, CLAP, and CoverID. These effects persist across genres and languages. More surprisingly, we find that phonetic prompts alone can trigger visual memorization in text-to-video models: when given altered lyrics from Lose Yourself, Veo 3 generates scenes that mirror the original music video--complete with a hooded rapper and dim urban settings--despite no explicit visual cues in the prompt. This cross-modality leakage represents an unprecedented threat: models memorize deep, structural patterns that transcend their training modality, making traditional safety measures like copyright filters ineffective. Our findings reveal a fundamental vulnerability in transcript-conditioned generative models and raise urgent concerns around copyright, provenance, and secure deployment of multimodal generation systems.

Title: Learning Pivoting Manipulation with Force and Vision Feedback Using Optimization-based Demonstrations
Authors: Yuki Shirai, Kei Ota, Devesh K. Jha, Diego Romeres
Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation is challenging due to complex contact interactions between objects, the environment, and robots. Model-based approaches can efficiently generate complex trajectories of robots and objects under contact constraints. However, they tend to be sensitive to model inaccuracies and require access to privileged information (e.g., object mass, size, pose), making them less suitable for novel objects. In contrast, learning-based approaches are typically more robust to modeling errors but require large amounts of data. In this paper, we bridge these two approaches to propose a framework for learning closed-loop pivoting manipulation. By leveraging computationally efficient Contact-Implicit Trajectory Optimization (CITO), we design demonstration-guided deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), leading to sample-efficient learning. We also present a sim-to-real transfer approach using a privileged training strategy, enabling the robot to perform pivoting manipulation using only proprioception, vision, and force sensing without access to privileged information. Our method is evaluated on several pivoting tasks, demonstrating that it can successfully perform sim-to-real transfer. The overview of our method and the hardware experiments are shown at this https URL

Abstract: This paper presents a multifunctional speech synthesis system that integrates voice cloning and emotion control speech synthesis within a unified framework. The goal of this work is to address longstanding challenges in achieving highly expressive, controllable, and natural speech generation that faithfully preserves speaker identity across diverse linguistic and emotional contexts. Our approach introduces an effective speaker-emotion disentanglement mechanism with in-batch contrastive learning, enabling independent manipulation of speaker identity and eemotional style, as well as rotational emotional embedding integration method for smooth emotion control. To support comprehensive training and evaluation, we construct CSEMOTIONS, a high-quality emotional speech dataset containing 10 hours of Mandarin speech from six professional speakers across seven emotional categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system, Marco-Voice, achieves substantial improvements in both objective and subjective metrics. Comprehensive evaluations and analysis were conducted, results show that MarcoVoice delivers competitive performance in terms of speech clarity and emotional richness, representing a substantial advance in the field of expressive neural speech synthesis. Our code and dataset are publicly available at this https URL and this https URL respectively.

Title: Live Demonstration: Neuromorphic Radar for Gesture Recognition
Authors: Satyapreet Singh Yadav, Akash K S, Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula, Chetan Singh Thakur
Abstract: We present a neuromorphic radar framework for real-time, low-power hand gesture recognition (HGR) using an event-driven architecture inspired by biological sensing. Our system comprises a 24 GHz Doppler radar front-end and a custom neuromorphic sampler that converts intermediate-frequency (IF) signals into sparse spike-based representations via asynchronous sigma-delta encoding. These events are directly processed by a lightweight neural network deployed on a Cortex-M0 microcontroller, enabling low-latency inference without requiring spectrogram reconstruction. Unlike conventional radar HGR pipelines that continuously sample and process data, our architecture activates only when meaningful motion is detected, significantly reducing memory, power, and computation overhead. Evaluated on a dataset of five gestures collected from seven users, our system achieves > 85% real-time accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that employs bio-inspired asynchronous sigma-delta encoding and an event-driven processing framework for radar-based HGR.

Title: READ: Real-time and Efficient Asynchronous Diffusion for Audio-driven Talking Head Generation
Authors: Haotian Wang, Yuzhe Weng, Jun Du, Haoran Xu, Xiaoyan Wu, Shan He, Bing Yin, Cong Liu, Jianqing Gao, Qingfeng Liu
Abstract: The introduction of diffusion models has brought significant advances to the field of audio-driven talking head generation. However, the extremely slow inference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based talking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, the first real-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our approach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via a temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate generation. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed latent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to generate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video latent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully designed Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient talking head synthesis. Furthermore, to ensure temporal consistency and accelerated inference in extended generation, we propose a novel asynchronous noise scheduler (ANS) for both the training and inference process of our framework. The ANS leverages asynchronous add-noise and asynchronous motion-guided generation in the latent space, ensuring consistency in generated video clips. Experimental results demonstrate that READ outperforms state-of-the-art methods by generating competitive talking head videos with significantly reduced runtime, achieving an optimal balance between quality and speed while maintaining robust metric stability in long-time generation.

Title: EmoSteer-TTS: Fine-Grained and Training-Free Emotion-Controllable Text-to-Speech via Activation Steering
Authors: Tianxin Xie, Shan Yang, Chenxing Li, Dong Yu, Li Liu
Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) has shown great progress in recent years. However, most existing TTS systems offer only coarse and rigid emotion control, typically via discrete emotion labels or a carefully crafted and detailed emotional text prompt, making fine-grained emotion manipulation either inaccessible or unstable. These models also require extensive, high-quality datasets for training. To address these limitations, we propose EmoSteer-TTS, a novel training-free approach, to achieve fine-grained speech emotion control (conversion, interpolation, erasure) by activation steering. We first empirically observe that modifying a subset of the internal activations within a flow matching-based TTS model can effectively alter the emotional tone of synthesized speech. Building on this insight, we then develop a training-free and efficient algorithm, including activation extraction, emotional token searching, and inference-time steering, which can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of pretrained models (e.g., F5-TTS, CosyVoice2, and E2-TTS). In addition, to derive effective steering vectors, we construct a curated emotional speech dataset with diverse speakers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EmoSteer-TTS enables fine-grained, interpretable, and continuous control over speech emotion, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that achieves training-free and continuous fine-grained emotion control in TTS.

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs), as a nonparametric learning method, offer flexible modeling capabilities and calibrated uncertainty quantification for function approximations. Additionally, GPs support online learning by efficiently incorporating new data with polynomial-time computation, making them well-suited for safety-critical dynamical systems that require rapid adaptation. However, the inference and online updates of exact GPs, when processing streaming data, incur cubic computation time and quadratic storage memory complexity, limiting their scalability to large datasets in real-time settings. In this paper, we propose a streaming kernel-induced progressively generated expert framework of Gaussian processes (SkyGP) that addresses both computational and memory constraints by maintaining a bounded set of experts, while inheriting the learning performance guarantees from exact Gaussian processes. Furthermore, two SkyGP variants are introduced, each tailored to a specific objective, either maximizing prediction accuracy (SkyGP-Dense) or improving computational efficiency (SkyGP-Fast). The effectiveness of SkyGP is validated through extensive benchmarks and real-time control experiments demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
