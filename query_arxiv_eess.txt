Title: Interaction-Aware Model Predictive Decision-Making for Socially-Compliant Autonomous Driving in Mixed Urban Traffic Scenarios
Authors: Balint Varga, Thomas Brand, Marcus Schmitz, Ehsan Hashemi
Abstract: This paper presents the experimental validation of an interaction-aware model predictive decision-making (IAMPDM) approach in the course of a simulator study. The proposed IAMPDM uses a model of the pedestrian, which simultaneously predicts their future trajectories and characterizes the interaction between the pedestrian and the automated vehicle. The main benefit of the proposed concept and the experiment is that the interaction between the pedestrian and the socially compliant autonomous vehicle leads to smoother traffic. Furthermore, the experiment features a novel human-in-the-decision-loop aspect, meaning that the test subjects have no expected behavior or defined sequence of their actions, better imitating real traffic scenarios. Results show that intention-aware decision-making algorithms are more effective in realistic conditions and contribute to smoother traffic flow than state-of-the-art solutions. Furthermore, the findings emphasize the crucial impact of intention-aware decision-making on autonomous vehicle performance in urban areas and the need for further research.

Title: A strictly predefined-time convergent and anti-noise fractional-order zeroing neural network for solving time-variant quadratic programming in kinematic robot control
Authors: Yi Yang, Xiao Li, Xuchen Wang, Mei Liu, Junwei Yin, Weibing Li, Richard M. Voyles, Xin Ma
Abstract: This paper proposes a strictly predefined-time convergent and anti-noise fractional-order zeroing neural network (SPTC-AN-FOZNN) model, meticulously designed for addressing time-variant quadratic programming (TVQP) problems. This model marks the first variable-gain ZNN to collectively manifest strictly predefined-time convergence and noise resilience, specifically tailored for kinematic motion control of robots. The SPTC-AN-FOZNN advances traditional ZNNs by incorporating a conformable fractional derivative in accordance with the Leibniz rule, a compliance not commonly achieved by other fractional derivative definitions. It also features a novel activation function designed to ensure favorable convergence independent of the model's order. When compared to five recently published recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the SPTC-AN-FOZNN, configured with $0<\alpha\leq 1$, exhibits superior positional accuracy and robustness against additive noises for TVQP applications. Extensive empirical evaluations, including simulations with two types of robotic manipulators and experiments with a Flexiv Rizon robot, have validated the SPTC-AN-FOZNN's effectiveness in precise tracking and computational efficiency, establishing its utility for robust kinematic control.

Title: A Review of Artificial Intelligence Impacting Statistical Process Monitoring and Future Directions
Authors: Shing I Chang, Parviz Ghafariasl
Abstract: It has been 100 years since statistical process control (SPC) or statistical process monitoring (SPM) was first introduced for production processes and later applied to service, healthcare, and other industries. The techniques applied to SPM applications are mostly statistically oriented. Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have reinvigorated the imagination of adopting AI for SPM applications. This manuscript begins with a concise review of the historical development of the statistically based SPM methods. Next, this manuscript explores AI and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and methods applied in various SPM applications, addressing quality characteristics of univariate, multivariate, profile, and image. These AI methods can be classified into the following categories: classification, pattern recognition, time series applications, and generative AI. Specifically, different kinds of neural networks, such as artificial neural networks (ANN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), and generative adversarial networks (GAN), are among the most implemented AI methods impacting SPM. Finally, this manuscript outlines a couple of future directions that harness the potential of the Large Multimodal Model (LMM) for advancing SPM research and applications in complex systems. The ultimate objective is to transform statistical process monitoring (SPM) into smart process control (SMPC), where corrective actions are autonomously implemented to either prevent quality issues or restore process performance.

Title: Clearing function-based release date optimization in a multi-item multi-stage MRP planned production system in a rolling-horizon planning environment with multilevel BOM
Authors: Wolfgang Seiringer, Klaus Altendorfer, Reha Uzsoy
Abstract: This study explores the integration of clearing function (CF)-based release planning into Material Requirements Planning (MRP) systems, with a focus on mitigating the inherent rigidity of MRP in handling variability in production environments. By replacing the backward scheduling step of MRP with a CF-based optimization model, this work investigates its impact on overall costs, lead times, and system performance in multi-item, multi-stage production systems. Computational experiments were conducted on two distinct systems - a simple and a complex production system - under varying demand behaviors and utilization levels. The findings reveal that the CF-based release order planning consistently outperforms traditional MRP in managing cost and variability, particularly under scenarios of higher demand uncertainty and shop load. While MRP demonstrates stability in less complex scenarios, its inability to adapt dynamically to variability leads to higher costs in most conditions. The analysis underscores the potential of CF-based methods to enhance planning efficiency in dynamic production settings, providing a foundation for future research on integrating capacity constraints within the broader MRP framework.

Title: Tracking Control of Euler-Lagrangian Systems with Prescribed State, Input, and Temporal Constraints
Authors: Chidre Shravista Kashyap, Pushpak Jagtap, Jishnu Keshavan
Abstract: The synthesis of a smooth tracking control policy for Euler-Lagrangian (EL) systems with stringent regions of operation induced by state, input and temporal (SIT) constraints is a very challenging task. Most existing solutions rely on prior information of the parameters of the nominal EL dynamics together with bounds on system uncertainty, and incorporate either state or input constraints to guarantee tracking error convergence in a prescribed settling time. Contrary to these approaches, this study proposes an approximation-free adaptive barrier function-based control policy for achieving local prescribed-time convergence of the tracking error to a prescribed-bound in the presence of state and input constraints. This is achieved by imposing time-varying bounds on the filtered tracking error to confine the states within their respective bounds, while also incorporating a saturation function to limit the magnitude of the proposed control action that leverages smooth time-based generator functions for ensuring tracking error convergence within the prescribed-time. Importantly, corresponding feasibility conditions pertaining to the minimum control authority, maximum disturbance rejection capability of the control policy, and the viable set of initial conditions are derived, illuminating the narrow operating domain of the EL systems arising from the interplay of SIT constraints. Numerical validation studies with three different robotic manipulators are employed to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme. A detailed performance comparison study with leading alternative designs is also undertaken to illustrate the superior performance of the proposed scheme.

Title: Levels of Spacecraft Autonomy
Authors: Daniel Baker (Defense Sector, BlueHalo, LLC), Sean Phillips (Space Control Branch (RVSW), Air Force Research Laboratory)
Abstract: As autonomous systems are being developed in multiple industries it has been recognized that a phased approach is needed both for technical development and user acceptance. Partially in response, the automotive and aircraft industries have published five or six Levels of Autonomy in an attempt to broadly characterize the amount of autonomy technology that is present in any particular vehicle. We have developed a similar six Levels of Spacecraft Autonomy for similar purposes. Here, we propose extending these ideas to spacecraft constellations, clusters, swarms, ground stations for spacecraft, and strategic collaboration among space and ground assets. We intend these levels of autonomy to be used to characterize and describe high-level capabilities for any given satellite for education and communication with lawmakers, government officials, and the general public. All of the proposed levels mimic those of the automotive and aircraft levels in an attempt to maintain consistency and a common understanding with our intended audiences.

Title: A Lightweight Deep Exclusion Unfolding Network for Single Image Reflection Removal
Authors: Jun-Jie Huang, Tianrui Liu, Zihan Chen, Xinwang Liu, Meng Wang, Pier Luigi Dragotti
Abstract: Single Image Reflection Removal (SIRR) is a canonical blind source separation problem and refers to the issue of separating a reflection-contaminated image into a transmission and a reflection image. The core challenge lies in minimizing the commonalities among different sources. Existing deep learning approaches either neglect the significance of feature interactions or rely on heuristically designed architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Exclusion unfolding Network (DExNet), a lightweight, interpretable, and effective network architecture for SIRR. DExNet is principally constructed by unfolding and parameterizing a simple iterative Sparse and Auxiliary Feature Update (i-SAFU) algorithm, which is specifically designed to solve a new model-based SIRR optimization formulation incorporating a general exclusion prior. This general exclusion prior enables the unfolded SAFU module to inherently identify and penalize commonalities between the transmission and reflection features, ensuring more accurate separation. The principled design of DExNet not only enhances its interpretability but also significantly improves its performance. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DExNet achieves state-of-the-art visual and quantitative results while utilizing only approximately 8\% of the parameters required by leading methods.

Title: Group Sparsity Methods for Compressive Space-Frequency Channel Estimation and Spatial Equalization in Fluid Antenna System
Authors: Xuehui Dong, Kai Wan, Shuangyang Li, Robert Caiming Qiu, Giuseppe Caire
Abstract: Fluid Antenna System (FAS) unlocks unprecedented flexibility in wireless channel optimization through spatial reconfigurability. However, its practical deployment is hindered by the coupled challenges posed by high-dimensional channel estimation and real-time position optimization. This paper bridges wireless propagation physics with compressed sensing theory to address these challenges through three aspects. First, we establish a group-sparse recovery framework for space-frequency characteristics (SFC) in FAS, formally characterizing leakage-induced sparsity degradation from limited aperture and bandwidth as a structured group-sparsity problem. By deriving dictionary-adapted group restricted isometry property (D-GRIP), we prove tight recovery bounds for a convex $\ell_1/\ell_2$-mixed norm optimization formulation that preserves leakage-aware sparsity patterns. Second, we develop a Descending Correlation Group Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (DC-GOMP) algorithm that systematically relaxes leakage constraints to reduce subcoherence. This approach enables robust FSC recovery with accelerated convergence and superior performance compared to conventional compressive sensing methods like OMP or GOMP. Third, we formulate spatial equalization (SE) as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, ensuring optimality through the branch-and-bound method. To achieve real-time implementability while maintaining near-optimal performance, we complement this with a greedy algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed channel estimation algorithm effectively resolves energy misallocation and enables recovery of weak details, achieving superior recovery accuracy and convergence rate. The SE framework suppresses deep fading phenomena and reduces hardware deployment overhead while maintaining equivalent link reliability.

Title: Transition pathways to electrified chemical production within sector-coupled national energy systems
Authors: Patricia Mayer, Florian Joseph Baader, David Yang Shu, Ludger Leenders, Christian Zibunas, Stefano Moret, André Bardow
Abstract: The chemical industry's transition to net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is particularly challenging due to the carbon inherently contained in chemical products, eventually released to the environment. Fossil feedstock-based production can be replaced by electrified chemical production, combining carbon capture and utilization (CCU) with electrolysis-based hydrogen. However, electrified chemical production requires vast amounts of clean electricity, leading to competition in our sector-coupled energy systems. In this work, we investigate the pathway of the chemical industry towards electrified production within the context of a sector-coupled national energy system's transition to net-zero emissions. Our results show that the sectors for electricity, low-temperature heat, and mobility transition before the chemical industry due to the required build-up of renewables, and to the higher emissions abatement of heat pumps and battery electric vehicles. To achieve the net-zero target, the energy system relies on clean energy imports to cover 41\% of its electricity needs, largely driven by the high energy requirements of a fully electrified chemical industry. Nonetheless, a partially electrified industry combined with dispatchable production alternatives provides flexibility to the energy system by enabling electrified production when renewable electricity is available. Hence, a partially electrified, diversified chemical industry can support the integration of intermittent renewables, serving as a valuable component in net-zero energy systems.

Title: Detecting Unobservable Contingencies in Active Distribution Systems Using a Stochastic Hybrid Systems Approach
Authors: Erfan Mehdipour Abadi, Hamid Varmazyari, Masoud H. Nazari
Abstract: This paper introduces a distributed contingency detection algorithm for detecting unobservable contingencies in power distribution systems using stochastic hybrid system (SHS) models. We aim to tackle the challenge of limited measurement capabilities in distribution networks that restrict the ability to detect contingencies promptly. We incorporate the dynamics of distribution network connections, load feeders, PV, and battery energy storage system (BESS) hybrid resources into a fully correlated SHS model representing the distribution system as a randomly switching system between different structures during contingency occurrence. We show that jumps in the SHS model correspond to contingencies in the physical power grid. We propose a probing approach based on magnitude-modulation inputs (MaMI) to make contingencies detectable. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through simulations on a sample distribution system.

Title: CNN-based Robust Sound Source Localization with SRP-PHAT for the Extreme Edge
Authors: Jun Yin, Marian Verhelst
Abstract: Robust sound source localization for environments with noise and reverberation are increasingly exploiting deep neural networks fed with various acoustic features. Yet, state-of-the-art research mainly focuses on optimizing algorithmic accuracy, resulting in huge models preventing edge-device deployment. The edge, however, urges for real-time low-footprint acoustic reasoning for applications such as hearing aids and robot interactions. Hence, we set off from a robust CNN-based model using SRP-PHAT features, Cross3D [16], to pursue an efficient yet compact model architecture for the extreme edge. For both the SRP feature representation and neural network, we propose respectively our scalable LC-SRP-Edge and Cross3D-Edge algorithms which are optimized towards lower hardware overhead. LC-SRP-Edge halves the complexity and on-chip memory overhead for the sinc interpolation compared to the original LC-SRP [19]. Over multiple SRP resolution cases, Cross3D-Edge saves 10.32~73.71% computational complexity and 59.77~94.66% neural network weights against the Cross3D baseline. In terms of the accuracy-efficiency tradeoff, the most balanced version (EM) requires only 127.1 MFLOPS computation, 3.71 MByte/s bandwidth, and 0.821 MByte on-chip memory in total, while still retaining competitiveness in state-of-the-art accuracy comparisons. It achieves 8.59 ms/frame end-to-end latency on a Rasberry Pi 4B, which is 7.26x faster than the corresponding baseline.

Title: CrossFusion: A Multi-Scale Cross-Attention Convolutional Fusion Model for Cancer Survival Prediction
Authors: Rustin Soraki, Huayu Wang, Joann G. Elmore, Linda Shapiro
Abstract: Cancer survival prediction from whole slide images (WSIs) is a challenging task in computational pathology due to the large size, irregular shape, and high granularity of the WSIs. These characteristics make it difficult to capture the full spectrum of patterns, from subtle cellular abnormalities to complex tissue interactions, which are crucial for accurate prognosis. To address this, we propose CrossFusion, a novel multi-scale feature integration framework that extracts and fuses information from patches across different magnification levels. By effectively modeling both scale-specific patterns and their interactions, CrossFusion generates a rich feature set that enhances survival prediction accuracy. We validate our approach across six cancer types from public datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, when coupled with domain-specific feature extraction backbones, our method shows further gains in prognostic performance compared to general-purpose backbones.

Title: OrbID: Identifying Orbcomm Satellite RF Fingerprints
Authors: Cédric Solenthaler, Joshua Smailes Martin Strohmeier
Abstract: An increase in availability of Software Defined Radios (SDRs) has caused a dramatic shift in the threat landscape of legacy satellite systems, opening them up to easy spoofing attacks by low-budget adversaries. Physical-layer authentication methods can help improve the security of these systems by providing additional validation without modifying the space segment. This paper extends previous research on Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF) of satellite communication to the Orbcomm satellite formation. The GPS and Iridium constellations are already well covered in prior research, but the feasibility of transferring techniques to other formations has not yet been examined, and raises previously undiscussed challenges. In this paper, we collect a novel dataset containing 8992474 packets from the Orbcom satellite constellation using different SDRs and locations. We use this dataset to train RFF systems based on convolutional neural networks. We achieve an ROC AUC score of 0.53 when distinguishing different satellites within the constellation, and 0.98 when distinguishing legitimate satellites from SDRs in a spoofing scenario. We also demonstrate the possibility of mixing datasets using different SDRs in different physical locations.

Title: Pneumatically controlled non-magnetic, high-power, and low insertion loss RF switch
Authors: Chavalchart Herabut, Bryan Rangel Valle, Vikram D. Kodibagkar, Sung-Min Sohn (School of Biomedical and Health Systems Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA)
Abstract: While positive-intrinsic-negative (PIN) diodes are commonly used in radio frequency (RF) circuits, their use often degrades the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to high insertion loss and interference from additional biasing circuit components, which is critical for SNR-prioritized applications. This work presents the design of a novel pneumatically controlled switch, called AeroSwitch, which serves as an RF switch alternative to PIN diodes by significantly reducing lossy elements and additional biasing circuitry, with a focus on the applicability of AeroSwitch for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) RF switch implantation. AeroSwitch was assessed against the PIN diode using bench testing, revealing a slightly reduced average insertion loss of 0.1 dB and an enhancement in average isolation by 15 dB. The switches are incorporated into a capacitor switch array within an L-matching network. This matching network connects to a loop RF coil, serving as a high-impedance load. The quality (Q)-factors were evaluated compared to a PIN diode capacitor switch array matching network configured identically. Overall, the AeroSwitch demonstrated an average 62% improved Q-factor compared to the PIN diode. These findings indicate that AeroSwitch offers significant advantages over the PIN diode due to its lower loss and higher isolation, potentially improving SNR. Additionally, the temperature of the AeroSwitch, while operating at 100 watts, remained consistently below 30°C, suggesting its potential as a self-temperature-regulated high-power switch. Since the AeroSwitch is non-magnetic, has high-power capability, low insertion loss, requires no electric biasing, and uses no conductive wires, this switching technique is significantly beneficial for MRI applications and medical related other RF applications.

Title: MobRFFI: Non-cooperative Device Re-identification for Mobility Intelligence
Authors: Stepan Mazokha, Fanchen Bao, George Sklivanitis, Jason O. Hallstrom
Abstract: WiFi-based mobility monitoring in urban environments can provide valuable insights into pedestrian and vehicle movements. However, MAC address randomization introduces a significant obstacle in accurately estimating congestion levels and path trajectories. To this end, we consider radio frequency fingerprinting and re-identification for attributing WiFi traffic to emitting devices without the use of MAC addresses. We present MobRFFI, an AI-based device fingerprinting and re-identification framework for WiFi networks that leverages an encoder deep learning model to extract unique features based on WiFi chipset hardware impairments. It is entirely independent of frame type. When evaluated on the WiFi fingerprinting dataset WiSig, our approach achieves 94% and 100% device accuracy in multi-day and single-day re-identification scenarios, respectively. We also collect a novel dataset, MobRFFI, for granular multi-receiver WiFi device fingerprinting evaluation. Using the dataset, we demonstrate that the combination of fingerprints from multiple receivers boosts re-identification performance from 81% to 100% on a single-day scenario and from 41% to 100% on a multi-day scenario.

Title: Client-Aided Secure Two-Party Computation of Dynamic Controllers
Authors: Kaoru Teranishi, Takashi Tanaka
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a secure two-party computation protocol for dynamic controllers using a secret sharing scheme. The proposed protocol realizes outsourcing of controller computation to two servers, while controller parameters, states, inputs, and outputs are kept secret against the servers. Unlike previous encrypted controls in a single-server setting, the proposed method can operate a dynamic controller for an infinite time horizon without controller state decryption or input re-encryption. We show that the control performance achievable by the proposed protocol can be made arbitrarily close to that attained by the unencrypted controller. Furthermore, system-theoretic and cryptographic modifications of the protocol are presented to improve the communication complexity. The feasibility of the protocol is demonstrated through numerical examples of PID and observer-based controls.

Title: Low Complexity Frequency Domain Nonlinear Self-Interference Cancellation for Flexible Duplex
Authors: Yonghwi Kim, Kai-Kit Wong, Jianzhong (Charlie)Zhang, Chan-Byoung Chae
Abstract: Nonlinear self-interference (SI) cancellation is essential for mitigating the impact of transmitter-side nonlinearity on overall SI cancellation performance in flexible duplex systems, including in-band full-duplex (IBFD) and sub-band full-duplex (SBFD). Digital SI cancellation (SIC) must address the nonlinearity in the power amplifier (PA) and the in-phase/quadrature-phase (IQ) imbalance from up/down converters at the base station (BS), in addition to analog SIC. In environments with rich signal reflection paths, however, the required number of delayed taps for time-domain nonlinear SI cancellation increases exponentially with the number of multipaths, leading to excessive complexity. This paper introduces a novel, low-complexity, frequency domain nonlinear SIC, suitable for flexible duplex systems with multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) configurations. The key approach involves decomposing nonlinear SI into a nonlinear basis and categorizing them based on their effectiveness across any flexible duplex setting. The proposed algorithm is founded on our analytical results of intermodulation distortion (IMD) in the frequency domain and utilizes a specialized pilot sequence. This algorithm is directly applicable to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) multi-carrier systems and offers lower complexity than conventional digital SIC methods. Additionally, we assess the impact of the proposed SIC on flexible duplex systems through system-level simulation (SLS) using 3D ray-tracing and proof-of-concept (PoC) measurement.

Title: Joint ML-Bayesian Approach to Adaptive Radar Detection in the presence of Gaussian Interference
Authors: Chaoran Yin, Tianqi Wang, Linjie Yan, Chengpeng Hao, Alfonso Farina, Danilo Orlando
Abstract: This paper addresses the adaptive radar target detection problem in the presence of Gaussian interference with unknown statistical properties. To this end, the problem is first formulated as a binary hypothesis test, and then we derive a detection architecture grounded on the hybrid of Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Maximum A Posterior (MAP) approach. Specifically, we resort to the hidden discrete latent variables in conjunction with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms which cyclically updates the estimates of the unknowns. In this framework, the estimates of the a posteriori probabilities under each hypothesis are representative of the inherent nature of data and used to decide for the presence of a potential target. In addition, we prove that the developed detection scheme ensures the desired Constant False Alarm Rate property with respect to the unknown interference covariance matrix. Numerical examples obtained through synthetic and real recorded data corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and show that the MAP-based approach ensures evident improvement with respect to the conventional generalized likelihood ratio test at least for the considered scenarios and parameter setting.

Title: Deficient Excitation in Parameter Learning
Authors: Ganghui Cao, Shimin Wang, Martin Guay, Jinzhi Wang, Zhisheng Duan, Marios M. Polycarpou
Abstract: This paper investigates parameter learning problems under deficient excitation (DE). The DE condition is a rank-deficient, and therefore, a more general evolution of the well-known persistent excitation condition. Under the DE condition, a proposed online algorithm is able to calculate the identifiable and non-identifiable subspaces, and finally give an optimal parameter estimate in the sense of least squares. In particular, the learning error within the identifiable subspace exponentially converges to zero in the noise-free case, even without persistent excitation. The DE condition also provides a new perspective for solving distributed parameter learning problems, where the challenge is posed by local regressors that are often insufficiently excited. To improve knowledge of the unknown parameters, a cooperative learning protocol is proposed for a group of estimators that collect measured information under complementary DE conditions. This protocol allows each local estimator to operate locally in its identifiable subspace, and reach a consensus with neighbours in its non-identifiable subspace. As a result, the task of estimating unknown parameters can be achieved in a distributed way using cooperative local estimators. Application examples in system identification are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results developed in this paper.

Title: Volume Tells: Dual Cycle-Consistent Diffusion for 3D Fluorescence Microscopy De-noising and Super-Resolution
Authors: Zelin Li, Chenwei Wang, Zhaoke Huang, Yiming MA, Cunmin Zhao, Zhongying Zhao, Hong Yan
Abstract: 3D fluorescence microscopy is essential for understanding fundamental life processes through long-term live-cell imaging. However, due to inherent issues in imaging principles, it faces significant challenges including spatially varying noise and anisotropic resolution, where the axial resolution lags behind the lateral resolution up to 4.5 times. Meanwhile, laser power is kept low to maintain cell viability, leading to inaccessible low-noise and high-resolution paired ground truth (GT). To tackle these limitations, a dual Cycle-consistent Diffusion is proposed to effectively mine intra-volume imaging priors within 3D cell volumes in an unsupervised manner, i.e., Volume Tells (VTCD), achieving de-noising and super-resolution (SR) simultaneously. Specifically, a spatially iso-distributed denoiser is designed to exploit the noise distribution consistency between adjacent low-noise and high-noise regions within the 3D cell volume, suppressing the spatially varying noise. Then, in light of the structural consistency of the cell volume, a cross-plane global-propagation SR module propagates high-resolution details from the XY plane into adjacent regions in the XZ and YZ planes, progressively enhancing resolution across the entire 3D cell volume. Experimental results on 10 in vivo cellular dataset demonstrate high improvements in both denoising and super-resolution, with axial resolution enhanced from ~ 430 nm to ~ 90 nm.

Title: Rethinking Static Line Rating for Economic and Efficient Power Operation in South Korea
Authors: Junseon Park, Junhyun Lee, Hyeongon Park
Abstract: In South Korea, power grid is currently operated based on the static line rating (SLR) method, where the transmission line capacity is determined based on extreme weather conditions. However, with global warming, there is a concern that the temperatures during summer may exceed the SLR criteria, posing safety risks. On the other hand, the conservative estimates used for winter conditions limit the utilization of renewable energy. Proposals to install new lines face significant financial and environmental hurdles, complicating efforts to adapt to these changing conditions. Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) offers a real-time solution but requires extensive weather monitoring and complex integration. This paper proposes a novel method that improves on SLR by analyzing historical data to refine line rating criteria on a monthly, seasonal, and semi-annual basis. Through simulations, we show our approach significantly enhances cost effectiveness and reliability of the power system, achieving efficiencies close to DLR with existing infrastructure. This method offers a practical alternative to overcome the limitations of SLR and the implementation challenges of DLR.

Title: Optimal Control for Remote Patient Monitoring with Multidimensional Health States
Authors: Siddharth Chandak, Isha Thapa, Nicholas Bambos, David Scheinker
Abstract: Selecting the right monitoring level in Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) systems for e-healthcare is crucial for balancing patient outcomes, various resources, and patient's quality of life. A prior work has used one-dimensional health representations, but patient health is inherently multidimensional and typically consists of many measurable physiological factors. In this paper, we introduce a multidimensional health state model within the RPM framework and use dynamic programming to study optimal monitoring strategies. Our analysis reveals that the optimal control is characterized by switching curves (for two-dimensional health states) or switching hyper-surfaces (in general): patients switch to intensive monitoring when health measurements cross a specific multidimensional surface. We further study how the optimal switching curve varies for different medical conditions and model parameters. This finding of the optimal control structure provides actionable insights for clinicians and aids in resource planning. The tunable modeling framework enhances the applicability and effectiveness of RPM services across various medical conditions.

Title: RACNN: Residual Attention Convolutional Neural Network for Near-Field Channel Estimation in 6G Wireless Communications
Authors: Vu Tung Lam, Do Hai Son, Tran Thi Thuy Quynh, Le Trung Thanh
Abstract: Near-field channel estimation is a fundamental challenge in sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication, where extremely large antenna arrays (ELAA) enable near-field communication (NFC) but introduce significant signal processing complexity. Traditional model-based methods suffer from high computational costs and limited scalability in large-scale ELAA systems, while existing learning-based approaches often lack robustness across diverse channel conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Residual Attention Convolutional Neural Network (RACNN), which integrates convolutional layers with self-attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction by focusing on key regions within the CNN feature maps. Experimental results show that RACNN outperforms both traditional and learning-based methods, including XLCNet, across various scenarios, particularly in mixed far-field and near-field conditions. Notably, in these challenging settings, RACNN achieves a normalized mean square error (NMSE) of 4.8*10^(-3) at an SNR of 20dB, making it a promising solution for near-field channel estimation in 6G.

Title: Multi-Partite Output Regulation of Multi-Agent Systems
Authors: Kürşad Metehan Gül, Selahattin Burak Sarsılmaz
Abstract: This article proposes a simple, graph-independent perspective on partitioning the node set of a graph and provides multi-agent systems (MASs) with objectives beyond cooperation and bipartition. Specifically, we first introduce the notion of $k$-partition transformation to achieve any desired partition of the nodes. Then, we use this notion to formulate the multi-partite output regulation problem (MORP) of heterogeneous linear MASs, which comprises the existing cooperative output regulation problem (CORP) and bipartite output regulation problem (BORP) as subcases. The goal of the MORP is to design a distributed control law such that each follower that belongs to the same set in the partition asymptotically tracks a predefined multiple of a reference while ensuring the internal stability of the closed-loop system. It is shown that the necessary and sufficient conditions for the solvability of the MORP with a feedforward-based distributed control law follow from the CORP and lead to the first design strategy for the control parameters. However, it has a drawback in terms of scalability due to a partition-dependent condition. We prove that this condition is implied by its partition-independent version under a mild structural condition. This implication yields the second design strategy that is much more scalable than the first one. Finally, numerical examples are provided to illustrate the generality of the MORP and compare both design strategies regarding scalability.

Title: Semantic Prior Distillation with Vision Foundation Model for Enhanced Rapid Bone Scintigraphy Image Restoration
Authors: Pengchen Liang, Leijun Shi, Huiping Yao, Bin Pu, Jianguo Chen, Lei Zhao, Haishan Huang, Zhuangzhuang Chen, Zhaozhao Xu, Lite Xu, Qing Chang, Yiwei Li
Abstract: Rapid bone scintigraphy is an essential tool for diagnosing skeletal diseases and tumor metastasis in pediatric patients, as it reduces scan time and minimizes patient discomfort. However, rapid scans often result in poor image quality, potentially affecting diagnosis due to reduced resolution and detail, which make it challenging to identify and evaluate finer anatomical structures. To address this issue, we propose the first application of SAM-based semantic priors for medical image restoration, leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to enhance rapid bone scintigraphy images in pediatric populations. Our method comprises two cascaded networks, $f^{IR1}$ and $f^{IR2}$, augmented by three key modules: a Semantic Prior Integration (SPI) module, a Semantic Knowledge Distillation (SKD) module, and a Semantic Consistency Module (SCM). The SPI and SKD modules incorporate domain-specific semantic information from a fine-tuned SAM, while the SCM maintains consistent semantic feature representation throughout the cascaded networks. In addition, we will release a novel Rapid Bone Scintigraphy dataset called RBS, the first dataset dedicated to rapid bone scintigraphy image restoration in pediatric patients. RBS consists of 137 pediatric patients aged between 0.5 and 16 years who underwent both standard and rapid bone scans. The dataset includes scans performed at 20 cm/min (standard) and 40 cm/min (rapid), representing a $2\times$ acceleration. We conducted extensive experiments on both the publicly available endoscopic dataset and RBS. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms all existing methods across various metrics, including PSNR, SSIM, FID, and LPIPS.

Title: Generative Model-Assisted Demosaicing for Cross-multispectral Cameras
Authors: Jiahui Luo, Kai Feng, Haijin Zeng, Yongyong Chen
Abstract: As a crucial part of the spectral filter array (SFA)-based multispectral imaging process, spectral demosaicing has exploded with the proliferation of deep learning techniques. However, (1) bothering by the difficulty of capturing corresponding labels for real data or simulating the practical spectral imaging process, end-to-end networks trained in a supervised manner using simulated data often perform poorly on real data. (2) cross-camera spectral discrepancies make it difficult to apply pre-trained models to new cameras. (3) existing demosaicing networks are prone to introducing visual artifacts on hard cases due to the interpolation of unknown values. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid supervised training method with the assistance of the self-supervised generative model, which performs well on real data across different spectral cameras. Specifically, our approach consists of three steps: (1) Pre-Training step: training the end-to-end neural network on a large amount of simulated data; (2) Pseudo-Pairing step: generating pseudo-labels of real target data using the self-supervised generative model; (3) Fine-Tuning step: fine-tuning the pre-trained model on the pseudo data pairs obtained in (2). To alleviate artifacts, we propose a frequency-domain hard patch selection method that identifies artifact-prone regions by analyzing spectral discrepancies using Fourier transform and filtering techniques, allowing targeted fine-tuning to enhance demosaicing performance. Finally, we propose UniSpecTest, a real-world multispectral mosaic image dataset for testing. Ablation experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of each training step, and extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show that our method achieves significant performance gains compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Title: A Game-Theoretic Approach for High-Resolution Automotive FMCW Radar Interference Avoidance
Authors: Yunian Pan, Jun Li, Lifan Xu, Shunqiao Sun, Quanyan Zhu
Abstract: Nonlinear frequency hopping has emerged as a promising approach for mitigating interference and enhancing range resolution in automotive FMCW radar systems. Achieving an optimal balance between high range-resolution and effective interference mitigation remains challenging, especially without centralized frequency scheduling. This paper presents a game-theoretic framework for interference avoidance, in which each radar operates as an independent player, optimizing its performance through decentralized decision-making. We examine two equilibrium concepts--Nash Equilibrium (NE) and Coarse Correlated Equilibrium (CCE)--as strategies for frequency band allocation, with CCE demonstrating particular effectiveness through regret minimization algorithms. We propose two interference avoidance algorithms: Nash Hopping, a model-based approach, and No-Regret Hopping, a model-free adaptive method. Simulation results indicate that both methods effectively reduce interference and enhance the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Notably, No-regret Hopping further optimizes frequency spectrum utilization, achieving improved range resolution compared to Nash Hopping.

Title: COMMA: Coordinate-aware Modulated Mamba Network for 3D Dispersed Vessel Segmentation
Authors: Gen Shi, Hui Zhang, Jie Tian
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of 3D vascular structures is essential for various medical imaging applications. The dispersed nature of vascular structures leads to inherent spatial uncertainty and necessitates location awareness, yet most current 3D medical segmentation models rely on the patch-wise training strategy that usually loses this spatial context. In this study, we introduce the Coordinate-aware Modulated Mamba Network (COMMA) and contribute a manually labeled dataset of 570 cases, the largest publicly available 3D vessel dataset to date. COMMA leverages both entire and cropped patch data through global and local branches, ensuring robust and efficient spatial location awareness. Specifically, COMMA employs a channel-compressed Mamba (ccMamba) block to encode entire image data, capturing long-range dependencies while optimizing computational costs. Additionally, we propose a coordinate-aware modulated (CaM) block to enhance interactions between the global and local branches, allowing the local branch to better perceive spatial information. We evaluate COMMA on six datasets, covering two imaging modalities and five types of vascular tissues. The results demonstrate COMMA's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods with computational efficiency, especially in segmenting small vessels. Ablation studies further highlight the importance of our proposed modules and spatial information. The code and data will be open source at this https URL.

Title: A General Optimization Framework for Tackling Distance Constraints in Movable Antenna-Aided Systems
Authors: Yichen Jin, Qingfeng Lin, Yang Li, Hancheng Zhu, Bingyang Cheng, Yik-Chung Wu, Rui Zhang
Abstract: The recently emerged movable antenna (MA) shows great promise in leveraging spatial degrees of freedom to enhance the performance of wireless systems. However, resource allocation in MA-aided systems faces challenges due to the nonconvex and coupled constraints on antenna positions. This paper systematically reveals the challenges posed by the minimum antenna separation distance constraints. Furthermore, we propose a penalty optimization framework for resource allocation under such new constraints for MA-aided systems. Specifically, the proposed framework separates the non-convex and coupled antenna distance constraints from the movable region constraints by introducing auxiliary variables. Subsequently, the resulting problem is efficiently solved by alternating optimization, where the optimization of the original variables resembles that in conventional resource allocation problem while the optimization with respect to the auxiliary variables is achieved in closedform solutions. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we present three case studies: capacity maximization, latency minimization, and regularized zero-forcing precoding. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed optimization framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art schemes.

Title: Building 3D In-Context Learning Universal Model in Neuroimaging
Authors: Jiesi Hu, Hanyang Peng, Yanwu Yang, Xutao Guo, Yang Shang, Pengcheng Shi, Chenfei Ye, Ting Ma
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL), a type of universal model, demonstrates exceptional generalization across a wide range of tasks without retraining by leveraging task-specific guidance from context, making it particularly effective for the complex demands of neuroimaging. However, existing ICL models, which take 2D images as input, struggle to fully leverage the 3D anatomical structures in neuroimages, leading to a lack of global awareness and suboptimal performance. In this regard, we introduce Neuroverse3D, an ICL model capable of performing multiple neuroimaging tasks (e.g., segmentation, denoising, inpainting) in 3D. Neuroverse3D overcomes the large memory consumption due to 3D inputs through adaptive parallel-sequential context processing and a U-shape fusion strategy, allowing it to handle an unlimited number of context images. Additionally, we propose an optimized loss to balance multi-task training and enhance the focus on anatomical structures. Our study incorporates 43,674 3D scans from 19 neuroimaging datasets and evaluates Neuroverse3D on 14 diverse tasks using held-out test sets. The results demonstrate that Neuroverse3D significantly outperforms existing ICL models and closely matches the performance of task-specific models.

Title: Linear Convergence of Distributed Compressed Optimization with Equality Constraints
Authors: Zihao Ren, Lei Wang, Zhengguang Wu, Guodong Shi
Abstract: In this paper, the distributed strongly convex optimization problem is studied with spatio-temporal compressed communication and equality constraints. For the case where each agent holds an distributed local equality constraint, a distributed saddle-point algorithm is proposed by employing distributed filters to derive errors of the transmitted states for spatio-temporal compression purposes. It is shown that the resulting distributed compressed algorithm achieves linear convergence. Furthermore, the algorithm is generalized to the case where each agent holds a portion of the global equality constraint, i.e., the constraints across agents are coupled. By introducing an additional design freedom, the global equality constraint is shown to be equivalent to the one where each agent holds an equality constraint, for which the proposed distributed compressed saddle-point algorithm can be adapted to achieve linear convergence. Numerical simulations are adopted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

Title: Scene-based nonuniformity correction with homography transformation
Authors: Peretz Yafin, Nir Sochen, Iftach Klapp
Abstract: Due to their affordable, low mass, and small dimensions, uncooled microbolometer-based thermal focal plane arrays (UC-FPAs) are useful for long-wave infrared (LWIR)imaging applications. However, in outdoor conditions typical in agricultural remote sensing, cameras based on UC-FPAs may suffer from drift in offset and gain. To tackle the persistent drift, the system requires continuous calibration. Our goal in this study was to eliminate this requirement via a computational schema. In a former study, we estimated unknown gain and offset values and thermographic images of an object from a sequence of pairs of successive images taken at two different blur this http URL the current work, we took on a similar problem using a sequence of shifted images, with relative shifts caused by realistic drone hovering modeled by homography transformation. This places our work in the realm of scene-based nonuniformity correction problems. We show that an object's thermographic values, as well as gain and offset, can be jointly estimated by relying on a few sets of shifted images. We use a minimum likelihood estimator, which is found using alternating minimization. Registration is done using a generalized Lucas-Kanade method. Simulations show promising accuracy with mean Pearson correlation of more than 0.9999998 between ground truth and restoration. Under ideal assumptions, this is equivalent to a mean restoration error of less than 0.01 Celsius degree.

Title: A Systematic Literature Review on Safety of the Intended Functionality for Automated Driving Systems
Authors: Milin Patel, Rolf Jung, Marzana Khatun
Abstract: In the automobile industry, ensuring the safety of automated vehicles equipped with the Automated Driving System (ADS) is becoming a significant focus due to the increasing development and deployment of automated driving. Automated driving depends on sensing both the external and internal environments of a vehicle, utilizing perception sensors and algorithms, and Electrical/Electronic (E/E) systems for situational awareness and response. ISO 21448 is the standard for Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) that aims to ensure that the ADS operate safely within their intended functionality. SOTIF focuses on preventing or mitigating potential hazards that may arise from the limitations or failures of the ADS, including hazards due to insufficiencies of specification, or performance insufficiencies, as well as foreseeable misuse of the intended functionality. However, the challenge lies in ensuring the safety of vehicles despite the limited availability of extensive and systematic literature on SOTIF. To address this challenge, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on SOTIF for the ADS is performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The objective is to methodically gather and analyze the existing literature on SOTIF. The major contributions of this paper are: (i) presenting a summary of the literature by synthesizing and organizing the collective findings, methodologies, and insights into distinct thematic groups, and (ii) summarizing and categorizing the acknowledged limitations based on data extracted from an SLR of 51 research papers published between 2018 and 2023. Furthermore, research gaps are determined, and future research directions are proposed.

Title: Goal-Oriented Interference Coordination in 6G In-Factory Subnetworks
Authors: Daniel Abode, Pedro Maia de Sant Ana, Ramoni Adeogun, Alexander Artemenko, Gilberto Berardinelli
Abstract: Subnetworks are expected to enhance wireless pervasiveness for critical applications such as wireless control of plants, however, they are interference-limited due to their extreme density. This paper proposes a goal-oriented joint power and multiple sub-bands allocation policy for interference coordination in 6G in-factory subnetworks. Current methods for interference coordination in subnetworks only focus on optimizing communication metrics, such as the block error rate, without considering the goal of the controlled plants. This oversight often leads to inefficient allocation of the limited radio resources. To address this, we devise a novel decentralized inter-subnetwork interference coordination policy optimized using a Bayesian framework to ensure the long-term stability of the subnetwork-controlled plants. Our results show that the proposed decentralized method can support more than twice the density of subnetwork-controlled plants compared to centralized schemes that aim to minimize the block error rate while reducing execution complexity significantly.

Title: Velocity-free task-space regulator for robot manipulators with external disturbances
Authors: Haiwen Wu, Bayu Jayawardhana, Dabo Xu
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of task-space robust regulation of robot manipulators subject to external disturbances. A velocity-free control law is proposed by combining the internal model principle and the passivity-based output-feedback control approach. The developed output-feedback controller ensures not only asymptotic convergence of the regulation error but also suppression of unwanted external step/sinusoidal disturbances. The potential of the proposed method lies in its simplicity, intuitively appealing, and simple gain selection criteria for synthesis of multi-joint robot manipulator control systems.

Abstract: Overall, in any system, the proportional term, integral term, and derivative term combined to produce a fast response time, less overshoot, no oscillations, increased stability, and no steady-state errors. Eliminating the steady state errors connected to typical PID systems is crucial for achieving stability. To plot the transfer function's responses with various integrator gains for auto tuning, a MATLAB M-file was developed. Auto tuning techniques were then applied to PID systems to eliminate steady state defects. this paper analyzes and tests the improvement of PID controller over the regular P-controller taking a hand follower robot as a system example using methods with simulation and numerical analysis study.

Title: Digital Linearizer Based on 1-Bit Quantizations
Authors: Deijany Rodriguez Linares, Håkan Johansson
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel low-complexity memoryless linearizer for suppression of distortion in analog frontends. It is based on our recently introduced linearizer which is inspired by neural networks, but with orders-of-magnitude lower complexity than conventional neural-networks considered in this context, and it can also outperform the conventional parallel memoryless Hammerstein linearizer. Further, it can be designed through matrix inversion and thereby the costly and time consuming numerical optimization traditionally used when training neural networks is avoided. The linearizer proposed in this paper is different in that it uses 1-bit quantizations as nonlinear activation functions and different bias values. These features enable a look-up table implementation which eliminates all but one of the multiplications and additions required for the linearization. Extensive simulations and comparisons are included in the paper, for distorted multi-tone signals and bandpass filtered white noise, which demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed linearizer.

Title: Undertrained Image Reconstruction for Realistic Degradation in Blind Image Super-Resolution
Authors: Ru Ito, Supatta Viriyavisuthisakul, Kazuhiko Kawamoto, Hiroshi Kera
Abstract: Most super-resolution (SR) models struggle with real-world low-resolution (LR) images. This issue arises because the degradation characteristics in the synthetic datasets differ from those in real-world LR images. Since SR models are trained on pairs of high-resolution (HR) and LR images generated by downsampling, they are optimized for simple degradation. However, real-world LR images contain complex degradation caused by factors such as the imaging process and JPEG compression. Due to these differences in degradation characteristics, most SR models perform poorly on real-world LR images. This study proposes a dataset generation method using undertrained image reconstruction models. These models have the property of reconstructing low-quality images with diverse degradation from input images. By leveraging this property, this study generates LR images with diverse degradation from HR images to construct the datasets. Fine-tuning pre-trained SR models on our generated datasets improves noise removal and blur reduction, enhancing performance on real-world LR images. Furthermore, an analysis of the datasets reveals that degradation diversity contributes to performance improvements, whereas color differences between HR and LR images may degrade performance. 11 pages, (11 figures and 2 tables)

Title: Closed-loop model-predictive wind farm flow control under time-varying inflow using FLORIDyn
Authors: Marcus Becker, Maarten J. van den Broek, Dries Allaerts, Jan-Willem van Wingerden
Abstract: Wind farm flow control has been a key research focus in recent years, driven by the idea that a collectively operating wind farm can outperform individually controlled turbines. Control strategies are predominantly applied in an open-loop manner, where the current flow conditions are used to look up precomputed steady-state set points. Closed-loop control approaches, on the other hand, take measurements from the farm into account and optimize their set points online, which makes them more flexible and resilient. This paper introduces a closed-loop model-predictive wind farm controller using the dynamic engineering model FLORIDyn to maximize the energy generated by a ten-turbine wind farm. The framework consists of an Ensemble Kalman Filter to continuously correct the flow field estimate, as well as a novel optimization strategy. To this end the paper discusses two dynamic ways to maximize the farm energy and compares this to the current look-up table industry standard. The framework relies solely on turbine measurements without using a flow field preview. In a 3-hour case study with time-varying conditions, the derived controllers achieve an overall energy gain of 3 to 4.4 % with noise-free wind direction measurements. If disturbed and biased measurements are used, this performance decreases to 1.9 to 3 % over the greedy control baseline with the same measurements. The comparison to look-up table controllers shows that the closed-loop framework performance is more robust to disturbed measurements but can only match the performance in noise-free conditions.

Title: Efficient Sampling and Sensitivity Analysis of Rare Transient Instability Events via Subset Simulation
Authors: Jingyu Liu, Xiaoting Wang, Xiaozhe Wang
Abstract: Assessing the risk of low-probability high-impact transient instability (TI) events is crucial for ensuring robust and stable power system operation under high uncertainty. However, direct Monte Carlo (DMC) simulation for rare TI event sampling is computationally intensive. This paper proposes a subset simulation-based method for efficient small TI probability estimation, rare TI events sampling, and subsequent sensitivity analysis. Numerical studies on the modified WSCC 9-bus system demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method over DMC. Additionally, targeted stability enhancement strategies are designed to eliminate rare TI events and enhance the system's robustness to specific transient faults.

Title: Optimal Power Management for Large-Scale Battery Energy Storage Systems via Bayesian Inference
Authors: Amir Farakhor, Iman Askari, Di Wu, Yebin Wang, Huazhen Fang
Abstract: Large-scale battery energy storage systems (BESS) have found ever-increasing use across industry and society to accelerate clean energy transition and improve energy supply reliability and resilience. However, their optimal power management poses significant challenges: the underlying high-dimensional nonlinear nonconvex optimization lacks computational tractability in real-world implementation, and the uncertainty of the exogenous power demand makes exact optimization difficult. This paper presents a new solution framework to address these bottlenecks. The solution pivots on introducing power-sharing ratios to specify each cell's power quota from the output power demand. To find the optimal power-sharing ratios, we formulate a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) problem to achieve power-loss-minimizing BESS operation while complying with safety, cell balancing, and power supply-demand constraints. We then propose a parameterized control policy for the power-sharing ratios, which utilizes only three parameters, to reduce the computational demand in solving the NMPC problem. This policy parameterization allows us to translate the NMPC problem into a Bayesian inference problem for the sake of 1) computational tractability, and 2) overcoming the nonconvexity of the optimization problem. We leverage the ensemble Kalman inversion technique to solve the parameter estimation problem. Concurrently, a low-level control loop is developed to seamlessly integrate our proposed approach with the BESS to ensure practical implementation. This low-level controller receives the optimal power-sharing ratios, generates output power references for the cells, and maintains a balance between power supply and demand despite uncertainty in output power. We conduct extensive simulations and experiments on a 20-cell prototype to validate the proposed approach.

Authors: M. van der Hulst, R. A. González, K. Classens, P. Tacx, N. Dirkx, J. van de Wijdeven, T. Oomen
Abstract: Multivariable parametric models are essential for optimizing the performance of high-tech systems. The main objective of this paper is to develop an identification strategy that provides accurate parametric models for complex multivariable systems. To achieve this, an additive model structure is adopted, offering advantages over traditional black-box model structures when considering physical systems. The introduced method minimizes a weighted least-squares criterion and uses an iterative linear regression algorithm to solve the estimation problem, achieving local optimality upon convergence. Experimental validation is conducted on a prototype wafer-stage system, featuring a large number of spatially distributed actuators and sensors and exhibiting complex flexible dynamic behavior, to evaluate performance and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: SPIDER: A Comprehensive Multi-Organ Supervised Pathology Dataset and Baseline Models
Authors: Dmitry Nechaev, Alexey Pchelnikov, Ekaterina Ivanova
Abstract: Advancing AI in computational pathology requires large, high-quality, and diverse datasets, yet existing public datasets are often limited in organ diversity, class coverage, or annotation quality. To bridge this gap, we introduce SPIDER (Supervised Pathology Image-DEscription Repository), the largest publicly available patch-level dataset covering multiple organ types, including Skin, Colorectal, and Thorax, with comprehensive class coverage for each organ. SPIDER provides high-quality annotations verified by expert pathologists and includes surrounding context patches, which enhance classification performance by providing spatial context. Alongside the dataset, we present baseline models trained on SPIDER using the Hibou-L foundation model as a feature extractor combined with an attention-based classification head. The models achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple tissue categories and serve as strong benchmarks for future digital pathology research. Beyond patch classification, the model enables rapid identification of significant areas, quantitative tissue metrics, and establishes a foundation for multimodal approaches. Both the dataset and trained models are publicly available to advance research, reproducibility, and AI-driven pathology development. Access them at: this https URL

Title: S-R2D2: a spherical extension of the R2D2 deep neural network series paradigm for wide-field radio-interferometric imaging
Authors: A. Tajja, A. Aghabiglou, E. Tolley, J-P. Kneib, J-P. Thiran, Y. Wiaux
Abstract: Recently, the R2D2 paradigm, standing for ''Residual-to-Residual DNN series for high-Dynamic-range imaging'', was introduced for image formation in Radio Interferometry (RI) as a learned version of the traditional algorithm CLEAN. The first incarnations of R2D2 are limited to planar imaging on small fields of view, failing to meet the spherical-imaging requirement of modern telescopes observing wide fields. To address this limitation, we propose the spherical-imaging extension S-R2D2. Firstly, as R2D2, S-R2D2 encapsulates its minor cycles in existing 2D-Euclidean deep neural network (DNN) architectures, but adapts its iterative scheme to incorporate the wide-field measurement model mapping a spherical image to visibility data. We implemented this model as the composition of an efficient Fourier-based interpolator mapping the spherical image onto the equatorial plane, with the standard RI operator mapping the equatorial-plane image to visibility data. Importantly, the interpolation step must inevitably be performed at a lower-than-optimal resolution on the plane, to meet the high-resolution requirement on the sphere of wide-field imaging while preserving scalability. Therefore, secondly, we design S-R2D2's DNN training loss to jointly learn to correct the interpolation approximations and identify residual image structures on the sphere, ensuring consistency with the spherical ground truth using the adjoint plane-to-sphere interpolator. Finally, we demonstrate through simulations S-R2D2's capability to perform fast and accurate reconstructions of spherical monochromatic intensity images, across high-resolution, high-dynamic-range settings.

Abstract: Human beings perceive the real world through a spectrum of sensory modalities, encompassing auditory, visual, and linguistic faculties. The journey towards achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates the development of models that can emulate these multifaceted perceptual capabilities and comprehensively understand these diversified data. To this end, we introduce \textbf{Nexus-O}, an industry-level \textbf{omni-perceptive and -interactive} model capable of efficiently processing Audio, Image, Video, and Text data in any combination and output audio/text in an end-to-end way. We systematically investigate Nexus-O by addressing three key research questions: First, how can models be efficiently designed and trained to achieve tri-modal alignment, understanding and reasoning capabilities across multiple modalities? Second, what approaches can be implemented to evaluate tri-modal model robustness, ensuring reliable performance and applicability in real-world scenarios? Third, what strategies can be employed to curate and obtain high-quality, real-life scenario speech datasets? For the first question, we design and pre-train Nexus-O based on the vision-language model, rather than the language model. By pre-training the model over high-quality synthetic audio data, our model is capable of tri-modal perception and interaction. For the second question, we introduce a new audio testbed, Nexus-O-audio, comprising diverse Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) samples, spanning various real-world scenarios, such as corporate meetings and live stream. For the third question, we design the speech data synthesis pipeline to obtain high-quality speech training datasets, covering various real-world scenarios. Comprehensive experimentation and an in-depth analysis of tri-modal alignment over latent space demonstrate the advantages of our model on downstream tasks.

Title: QDCNN: Quantum Deep Learning for Enhancing Safety and Reliability in Autonomous Transportation Systems
Authors: Ashtakala Meghanath, Subham Das, Bikash K.Behera, Muhammad Attique Khan, Saif Al-Kuwari, Ahmed Farouk
Abstract: In transportation cyber-physical systems (CPS), ensuring safety and reliability in real-time decision-making is essential for successfully deploying autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation networks. However, these systems face significant challenges, such as computational complexity and the ability to handle ambiguous inputs like shadows in complex environments. This paper introduces a Quantum Deep Convolutional Neural Network (QDCNN) designed to enhance the safety and reliability of CPS in transportation by leveraging quantum algorithms. At the core of QDCNN is the UU† method, which is utilized to improve shadow detection through a propagation algorithm that trains the centroid value with preprocessing and postprocessing operations to classify shadow regions in images accurately. The proposed QDCNN is evaluated on three datasets on normal conditions and one road affected by rain to test its robustness. It outperforms existing methods in terms of computational efficiency, achieving a shadow detection time of just 0.0049352 seconds, faster than classical algorithms like intensity-based thresholding (0.03 seconds), chromaticity-based shadow detection (1.47 seconds), and local binary pattern techniques (2.05 seconds). This remarkable speed, superior accuracy, and noise resilience demonstrate the key factors for safe navigation in autonomous transportation in real-time. This research demonstrates the potential of quantum-enhanced models in addressing critical limitations of classical methods, contributing to more dependable and robust autonomous transportation systems within the CPS framework.

Title: Accelerating Multi-Task Temporal Difference Learning under Low-Rank Representation
Authors: Yitao Bai, Sihan Zeng, Justin Romberg, Thinh T. Doan
Abstract: We study policy evaluation problems in multi-task reinforcement learning (RL) under a low-rank representation setting. In this setting, we are given $N$ learning tasks where the corresponding value function of these tasks lie in an $r$-dimensional subspace, with $r<N$. One can apply the classic temporal-difference (TD) learning method for solving these problems where this method learns the value function of each task independently. In this paper, we are interested in understanding whether one can exploit the low-rank structure of the multi-task setting to accelerate the performance of TD learning. To answer this question, we propose a new variant of TD learning method, where we integrate the so-called truncated singular value decomposition step into the update of TD learning. This additional step will enable TD learning to exploit the dominant directions due to the low rank structure to update the iterates, therefore, improving its performance. Our empirical results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the classic TD learning, where the performance gap increases as the rank $r$ decreases. From the theoretical point of view, introducing the truncated singular value decomposition step into TD learning might cause an instability on the updates. We provide a theoretical result showing that the instability does not happen. Specifically, we prove that the proposed method converges at a rate $\mathcal{O}(\frac{\ln(t)}{t})$, where $t$ is the number of iterations. This rate matches that of the standard TD learning.

Title: Active Alignments of Lens Systems with Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Matthias Burkhardt, Tobias Schmähling, Michael Layh, Tobias Windisch
Abstract: Aligning a lens system relative to an imager is a critical challenge in camera manufacturing. While optimal alignment can be mathematically computed under ideal conditions, real-world deviations caused by manufacturing tolerances often render this approach impractical. Measuring these tolerances can be costly or even infeasible, and neglecting them may result in suboptimal alignments. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that learns exclusively in the pixel space of the sensor output, eliminating the need to develop expert-designed alignment concepts. We conduct an extensive benchmark study and show that our approach surpasses other methods in speed, precision, and robustness. We further introduce relign, a realistic, freely explorable, open-source simulation utilizing physically based rendering that models optical systems with non-deterministic manufacturing tolerances and noise in robotic alignment movement. It provides an interface to popular machine learning frameworks, enabling seamless experimentation and development. Our work highlights the potential of RL in a manufacturing environment to enhance efficiency of optical alignments while minimizing the need for manual intervention.

Title: CorrA: Leveraging Large Language Models for Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance of Autonomous Vehicles
Authors: Shanting Wang, Panagiotis Typaldos, Andreas A. Malikopoulos
Abstract: In this paper, we present Corridor-Agent (CorrA), a framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with model predictive control (MPC) to address the challenges of dynamic obstacle avoidance in autonomous vehicles. Our approach leverages LLM reasoning ability to generate appropriate parameters for sigmoid-based boundary functions that define safe corridors around obstacles, effectively reducing the state-space of the controlled vehicle. The proposed framework adjusts these boundaries dynamically based on real-time vehicle data that guarantees collision-free trajectories while also ensuring both computational efficiency and trajectory optimality. The problem is formulated as an optimal control problem and solved with differential dynamic programming (DDP) for constrained optimization, and the proposed approach is embedded within an MPC framework. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance in maintaining safety and efficiency in complex, dynamic environments compared to a baseline MPC approach.

Title: Uncertainty Representation in a SOTIF-Related Use Case with Dempster-Shafer Theory for LiDAR Sensor-Based Object Detection
Authors: Milin Patel, Rolf Jung
Abstract: Uncertainty in LiDAR sensor-based object detection arises from environmental variability and sensor performance limitations. Representing these uncertainties is essential for ensuring the Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF), which focuses on preventing hazards in automated driving scenarios. This paper presents a systematic approach to identifying, classifying, and representing uncertainties in LiDAR-based object detection within a SOTIF-related scenario. Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) is employed to construct a Frame of Discernment (FoD) to represent detection outcomes. Conditional Basic Probability Assignments (BPAs) are applied based on dependencies among identified uncertainty sources. Yager's Rule of Combination is used to resolve conflicting evidence from multiple sources, providing a structured framework to evaluate uncertainties' effects on detection accuracy. The study applies variance-based sensitivity analysis (VBSA) to quantify and prioritize uncertainties, detailing their specific impact on detection performance.

Title: Distributed and Localized Covariance Control of Coupled Systems: A System Level Approach
Authors: Ahmed Khalil, Yoonjae Lee, Efstathios Bakolas
Abstract: This work is concerned with the finite-horizon optimal covariance steering of networked systems governed by discrete-time stochastic linear dynamics. In contrast with existing work that has only considered systems with dynamically decoupled agents, we consider a dynamically coupled system composed of interconnected subsystems subject to local communication constraints. In particular, we propose a distributed algorithm to compute the localized optimal feedback control policy for each individual subsystem, which depends only on the local state histories of its neighboring subsystems. Utilizing the system-level synthesis (SLS) framework, we first recast the localized covariance steering problem as a convex SLS problem with locality constraints. Subsequently, exploiting its partially separable structure, we decompose the latter problem into smaller subproblems, introducing a transformation to deal with nonseparable instances. Finally, we employ a variation of the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to distribute computation across subsystems on account of their local information and communication constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm on a power system with 36 interconnected subsystems.

Authors: Riku Kobayashi, Yoshihiro Kawahara, Takuya Sasatani
Abstract: The powering range of wireless power transfer (WPT) systems is typically confined to areas close to the transmitter. Shape-reconfigurable two-dimensional (2-D) relay resonator arrays have been developed to extend this range, offering greater deployment flexibility. However, these arrays encounter challenges due to cross-coupling among adjacent resonators, which detune system impedance and create power dead zones. This issue often necessitates active components such as receiver position tracking, increasing system overhead. This study introduces a passive reactance compensation mechanism that counteracts detuning effects, enabling the simultaneous activation of all resonators at a fixed operating frequency, regardless of the array's shape, thus providing a consistent charging area. The key innovation involves mechanically appending reactance elements to neutralize detuning caused by inductive coupling, facilitating hassle-free resonator reconfiguration without requiring prior knowledge. Our experiments demonstrate the elimination of dead zones with multiple configurations, boosting the minimum power transfer efficiency from 3.0% to 56.8%.

Title: DarkDeblur: Learning single-shot image deblurring in low-light condition
Authors: S M A Sharif, Rizwan Ali Naqvi, Farman Alic, Mithun Biswas
Abstract: Single-shot image deblurring in a low-light condition is known to be a profoundly challenging image translation task. This study tackles the limitations of the low-light image deblurring with a learning-based approach and proposes a novel deep network named as DarkDeblurNet. The proposed DarkDeblur- Net comprises a dense-attention block and a contextual gating mechanism in a feature pyramid structure to leverage content awareness. The model additionally incorporates a multi-term objective function to perceive a plausible perceptual image quality while performing image deblurring in the low-light settings. The practicability of the proposed model has been verified by fusing it in numerous computer vision applications. Apart from that, this study introduces a benchmark dataset collected with actual hardware to assess the low-light image deblurring methods in a real-world setup. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed method can outperform the state-of-the-art methods in both synthesized and real-world data for single-shot image deblurring, even in challenging lighting environment.

Title: Time-Varying Coronary Artery Deformation: A Dynamic Skinning Framework for Surgical Training
Authors: Shuo Wang, Tong Ren, Nan Cheng, Rong Wang, Li Zhang
Abstract: Purpose: This study proposes a novel anatomically-driven dynamic modeling framework for coronary arteries using skeletal skinning weights computation, aiming to achieve precise control over vessel deformation while maintaining real-time performance for surgical simulation applications. Methods: We developed a computational framework based on biharmonic energy minimization for skinning weight calculation, incorporating volumetric discretization through tetrahedral mesh generation. The method implements temporal sampling and interpolation for continuous vessel deformation throughout the cardiac cycle, with mechanical constraints and volume conservation enforcement. The framework was validated using clinical datasets from 5 patients, comparing interpolated deformation results against ground truth data obtained from frame-by-frame segmentation across cardiac phases. Results: The proposed framework effectively handled interactive vessel manipulation. Geometric accuracy evaluation showed mean Hausdorff distance of 4.96 +- 1.78 mm and mean surface distance of 1.78 +- 0.75 mm between interpolated meshes and ground truth models. The Branch Completeness Ratio achieved 1.82 +- 0.46, while Branch Continuity Score maintained 0.84 +- 0.06 (scale 0-1) across all datasets. The system demonstrated capability in supporting real-time guidewire-vessel collision detection and contrast medium flow simulation throughout the complete coronary tree structure. Conclusion: Our skinning weight-based methodology enhances model interactivity and applicability while maintaining geometric accuracy. The framework provides a more flexible technical foundation for virtual surgical training systems, demonstrating promising potential for both clinical practice and medical education applications.

Title: Anomaly detection in non-stationary videos using time-recursive differencing network based prediction
Authors: Gargi V. Pillai, Debashis Sen
Abstract: Most videos, including those captured through aerial remote sensing, are usually non-stationary in nature having time-varying feature statistics. Although, sophisticated reconstruction and prediction models exist for video anomaly detection, effective handling of non-stationarity has seldom been considered explicitly. In this paper, we propose to perform prediction using a time-recursive differencing network followed by autoregressive moving average estimation for video anomaly detection. The differencing network is employed to effectively handle non-stationarity in video data during the anomaly detection. Focusing on the prediction process, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated considering a simple optical flow based video feature, and by generating qualitative and quantitative results on three aerial video datasets and two standard anomaly detection video datasets. EER, AUC and ROC curve based comparison with several existing methods including the state-of-the-art reveal the superiority of the proposed approach.

Title: $\mathbfΦ$-GAN: Physics-Inspired GAN for Generating SAR Images Under Limited Data
Authors: Xidan Zhang, Yihan Zhuang, Qian Guo, Haodong Yang, Xuelin Qian, Gong Cheng, Junwei Han, Zhongling Huang
Abstract: Approaches for improving generative adversarial networks (GANs) training under a few samples have been explored for natural images. However, these methods have limited effectiveness for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, as they do not account for the unique electromagnetic scattering properties of SAR. To remedy this, we propose a physics-inspired regularization method dubbed $\Phi$-GAN, which incorporates the ideal point scattering center (PSC) model of SAR with two physical consistency losses. The PSC model approximates SAR targets using physical parameters, ensuring that $\Phi$-GAN generates SAR images consistent with real physical properties while preventing discriminator overfitting by focusing on PSC-based decision cues. To embed the PSC model into GANs for end-to-end training, we introduce a physics-inspired neural module capable of estimating the physical parameters of SAR targets efficiently. This module retains the interpretability of the physical model and can be trained with limited data. We propose two physical loss functions: one for the generator, guiding it to produce SAR images with physical parameters consistent with real ones, and one for the discriminator, enhancing its robustness by basing decisions on PSC attributes. We evaluate $\Phi$-GAN across several conditional GAN (cGAN) models, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in data-scarce scenarios on three SAR image datasets.

Title: Integrated Communication and Learned Recognizer with Customized RIS Phases and Sensing Durations
Authors: Yixuan Huang, Jie Yang, Chao-Kai Wen, Shi Jin
Abstract: Future wireless communication networks are expected to be smarter and more aware of their surroundings, enabling a wide range of context-aware applications. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are set to play a critical role in supporting various sensing tasks, such as target recognition. However, current methods typically use RIS configurations optimized once and applied over fixed sensing durations, limiting their ability to adapt to different targets and reducing sensing accuracy. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes an advanced wireless communication system that multiplexes downlink signals for environmental sensing and introduces an intelligent recognizer powered by deep learning techniques. Specifically, we design a novel neural network based on the long short-term memory architecture and the physical channel model. This network iteratively captures and fuses information from previous measurements, adaptively customizing RIS phases to gather the most relevant information for the recognition task at subsequent moments. These configurations are dynamically adjusted according to scene, task, target, and quantization priors. Furthermore, the recognizer includes a decision-making module that dynamically allocates different sensing durations, determining whether to continue or terminate the sensing process based on the collected measurements. This approach maximizes resource utilization efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques while minimizing the impact on communication performance, even when sensing and communication occur simultaneously.

Title: ForaNav: Insect-inspired Online Target-oriented Navigation for MAVs in Tree Plantations
Authors: Weijie Kuang, Hann Woei Ho, Ye Zhou, Shahrel Azmin Suandi
Abstract: Autonomous Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) are becoming essential in precision agriculture to enhance efficiency and reduce labor costs through targeted, real-time operations. However, existing unmanned systems often rely on GPS-based navigation, which is prone to inaccuracies in rural areas and limits flight paths to predefined routes, resulting in operational inefficiencies. To address these challenges, this paper presents ForaNav, an insect-inspired navigation strategy for autonomous navigation in plantations. The proposed method employs an enhanced Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG)-based tree detection approach, integrating hue-saturation histograms and global HOG feature variance with hierarchical HOG extraction to distinguish oil palm trees from visually similar objects. Inspired by insect foraging behavior, the MAV dynamically adjusts its path based on detected trees and employs a recovery mechanism to stay on course if a target is temporarily lost. We demonstrate that our detection method generalizes well to different tree types while maintaining lower CPU usage, lower temperature, and higher FPS than lightweight deep learning models, making it well-suited for real-time applications. Flight test results across diverse real-world scenarios show that the MAV successfully detects and approaches all trees without prior tree location, validating its effectiveness for agricultural automation.

Title: Minimizing Age of Detection for a Markov Source over a Lossy Channel
Authors: Shivang Garde, Jaya Prakash Champati, Arpan Chattopadhyay
Abstract: Monitoring a process/phenomenon of specific interest is prevalent in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), remote healthcare, smart buildings, intelligent transport, industry 4.0, etc. A key building block of the monitoring system is a sensor sampling the process and communicating the status updates to a monitor for detecting events of interest. Measuring the freshness of the status updates is essential for the timely detection of events, and it has received significant research interest in recent times. In this paper, we propose a new freshness metric, Age of Detection (AoD), for monitoring the state transitions of a Discrete Time Markov Chain (DTMC) source over a lossy wireless channel. We consider the pull model where the sensor samples DTMC state whenever the monitor requests a status update. We formulate a Constrained Markov Decision Problem (CMDP) for optimising the AoD subject to a constraint on the average sampling frequency and solve it using the Lagrangian MDP formulation and Relative Value Iteration (RVI) algorithm. Our numerical results show interesting trade-offs between AoD, sampling frequency, and transmission success probability. Further, the AoD minimizing policy provides a lower estimation error than the Age of Information (AoI) minimizing policy, thus demonstrating the utility of AoD for monitoring DTMC sources.

Title: Sparse Orthogonal Matching Pursuit-based Parameter Estimation for Integrated Sensing and Communications
Authors: Ngoc-Son Duong, Khac-Hoang Ngo, Thai-Mai Dinh, Van-Linh Nguyen
Abstract: Accurate parameter estimation such as angle of arrival (AOA) is essential to enhance the performance of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. This work presents a sensing-aided communication channel estimation mechanism, where the sensing channel shares the same AOA with the uplink communication channel. First, we propose a novel orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)-based method for coarsely estimating the AOA in a sensing channel, offering improved accuracy compared to conventional methods that rely on rotational invariance techniques. Next, we refine the coarse estimates obtained in the first step by modifying the Space-Alternating Generalized Expectation Maximization algorithm for fine parameter estimation. Through simulations and mathematical analysis, we demonstrate that scenarios with shared AOA achieve a better Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) than those without sharing. This finding highlights the potential of leveraging joint sensing and communication channels to enhance parameter estimation accuracy, particularly in channel or location estimation applications.

Title: RGBSQGrasp: Inferring Local Superquadric Primitives from Single RGB Image for Graspability-Aware Bin Picking
Authors: Yifeng Xu, Fan Zhu, Ye Li, Sebastian Ren, Xiaonan Huang, Yuhao Chen
Abstract: Bin picking is a challenging robotic task due to occlusions and physical constraints that limit visual information for object recognition and grasping. Existing approaches often rely on known CAD models or prior object geometries, restricting generalization to novel or unknown objects. Other methods directly regress grasp poses from RGB-D data without object priors, but the inherent noise in depth sensing and the lack of object understanding make grasp synthesis and evaluation more difficult. Superquadrics (SQ) offer a compact, interpretable shape representation that captures the physical and graspability understanding of objects. However, recovering them from limited viewpoints is challenging, as existing methods rely on multiple perspectives for near-complete point cloud reconstruction, limiting their effectiveness in bin-picking. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{RGBSQGrasp}, a grasping framework that leverages superquadric shape primitives and foundation metric depth estimation models to infer grasp poses from a monocular RGB camera -- eliminating the need for depth sensors. Our framework integrates a universal, cross-platform dataset generation pipeline, a foundation model-based object point cloud estimation module, a global-local superquadric fitting network, and an SQ-guided grasp pose sampling module. By integrating these components, RGBSQGrasp reliably infers grasp poses through geometric reasoning, enhancing grasp stability and adaptability to unseen objects. Real-world robotic experiments demonstrate a 92\% grasp success rate, highlighting the effectiveness of RGBSQGrasp in packed bin-picking environments.

Title: Robust detection of overlapping bioacoustic sound events
Authors: Louis Mahon, Benjamin Hoffman, Logan S James, Maddie Cusimano, Masato Hagiwara, Sarah C Woolley, Olivier Pietquin
Abstract: We propose a method for accurately detecting bioacoustic sound events that is robust to overlapping events, a common issue in domains such as ethology, ecology and conservation. While standard methods employ a frame-based, multi-label approach, we introduce an onset-based detection method which we name Voxaboxen. It takes inspiration from object detection methods in computer vision, but simultaneously takes advantage of recent advances in self-supervised audio encoders. For each time window, Voxaboxen predicts whether it contains the start of a vocalization and how long the vocalization is. It also does the same in reverse, predicting whether each window contains the end of a vocalization, and how long ago it started. The two resulting sets of bounding boxes are then fused using a graph-matching algorithm. We also release a new dataset designed to measure performance on detecting overlapping vocalizations. This consists of recordings of zebra finches annotated with temporally-strong labels and showing frequent overlaps. We test Voxaboxen on seven existing data sets and on our new data set. We compare Voxaboxen to natural baselines and existing sound event detection methods and demonstrate SotA results. Further experiments show that improvements are robust to frequent vocalization overlap.

Title: Aggregation Strategies for Efficient Annotation of Bioacoustic Sound Events Using Active Learning
Authors: Richard Lindholm, Oscar Marklund, Olof Mogren, John Martinsson
Abstract: The vast amounts of audio data collected in Sound Event Detection (SED) applications require efficient annotation strategies to enable supervised learning. Manual labeling is expensive and time-consuming, making Active Learning (AL) a promising approach for reducing annotation effort. We introduce Top K Entropy, a novel uncertainty aggregation strategy for AL that prioritizes the most uncertain segments within an audio recording, instead of averaging uncertainty across all segments. This approach enables the selection of entire recordings for annotation, improving efficiency in sparse data scenarios. We compare Top K Entropy to random sampling and Mean Entropy, and show that fewer labels can lead to the same model performance, particularly in datasets with sparse sound events. Evaluations are conducted on audio mixtures of sound recordings from parks with meerkat, dog, and baby crying sound events, representing real-world bioacoustic monitoring scenarios. Using Top K Entropy for active learning, we can achieve comparable performance to training on the fully labeled dataset with only 8% of the labels. Top K Entropy outperforms Mean Entropy, suggesting that it is best to let the most uncertain segments represent the uncertainty of an audio file. The findings highlight the potential of AL for scalable annotation in audio and time-series applications, including bioacoustics.

Title: Q&C: When Quantization Meets Cache in Efficient Image Generation
Authors: Xin Ding, Xin Li, Haotong Qin, Zhibo Chen
Abstract: Quantization and cache mechanisms are typically applied individually for efficient Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), each demonstrating notable potential for acceleration. However, the promoting effect of combining the two mechanisms on efficient generation remains under-explored. Through empirical investigation, we find that the combination of quantization and cache mechanisms for DiT is not straightforward, and two key challenges lead to severe catastrophic performance degradation: (i) the sample efficacy of calibration datasets in post-training quantization (PTQ) is significantly eliminated by cache operation; (ii) the combination of the above mechanisms introduces more severe exposure bias within sampling distribution, resulting in amplified error accumulation in the image generation process. In this work, we take advantage of these two acceleration mechanisms and propose a hybrid acceleration method by tackling the above challenges, aiming to further improve the efficiency of DiTs while maintaining excellent generation capability. Concretely, a temporal-aware parallel clustering (TAP) is designed to dynamically improve the sample selection efficacy for the calibration within PTQ for different diffusion steps. A variance compensation (VC) strategy is derived to correct the sampling distribution. It mitigates exposure bias through an adaptive correction factor generation. Extensive experiments have shown that our method has accelerated DiTs by 12.7x while preserving competitive generation capability. The code will be available at this https URL.

Title: TS-CGNet: Temporal-Spatial Fusion Meets Centerline-Guided Diffusion for BEV Mapping
Authors: Xinying Hong, Siyu Li, Kang Zeng, Hao Shi, Bomin Peng, Kailun Yang, Zhiyong Li
Abstract: Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception technology is crucial for autonomous driving, as it generates top-down 2D maps for environment perception, navigation, and decision-making. Nevertheless, the majority of current BEV map generation studies focusing on visual map generation lack depth-aware reasoning capabilities. They exhibit limited efficacy in managing occlusions and handling complex environments, with a notable decline in perceptual performance under adverse weather conditions or low-light scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes TS-CGNet, which leverages Temporal-Spatial fusion with Centerline-Guided diffusion. This visual framework, grounded in prior knowledge, is designed for integration into any existing network for building BEV maps. Specifically, this framework is decoupled into three parts: Local mapping system involves the initial generation of semantic maps using purely visual information; The Temporal-Spatial Aligner Module (TSAM) integrates historical information into mapping generation by applying transformation matrices; The Centerline-Guided Diffusion Model (CGDM) is a prediction module based on the diffusion model. CGDM incorporates centerline information through spatial-attention mechanisms to enhance semantic segmentation reconstruction. We construct BEV semantic segmentation maps by our methods on the public nuScenes and the robustness benchmarks under various corruptions. Our method improves 1.90%, 1.73%, and 2.87% for perceived ranges of 60x30m, 120x60m, and 240x60m in the task of BEV HD mapping. TS-CGNet attains an improvement of 1.92% for perceived ranges of 100x100m in the task of BEV semantic mapping. Moreover, TS-CGNet achieves an average improvement of 2.92% in detection accuracy under varying weather conditions and sensor interferences in the perception range of 240x60m.

Title: Unveiling the Potential of Segment Anything Model 2 for RGB-Thermal Semantic Segmentation with Language Guidance
Authors: Jiayi Zhao, Fei Teng, Kai Luo, Guoqiang Zhao, Zhiyong Li, Xu Zheng, Kailun Yang
Abstract: The perception capability of robotic systems relies on the richness of the dataset. Although Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), trained on large datasets, demonstrates strong perception potential in perception tasks, its inherent training paradigm prevents it from being suitable for RGB-T tasks. To address these challenges, we propose SHIFNet, a novel SAM2-driven Hybrid Interaction Paradigm that unlocks the potential of SAM2 with linguistic guidance for efficient RGB-Thermal perception. Our framework consists of two key components: (1) Semantic-Aware Cross-modal Fusion (SACF) module that dynamically balances modality contributions through text-guided affinity learning, overcoming SAM2's inherent RGB bias; (2) Heterogeneous Prompting Decoder (HPD) that enhances global semantic information through a semantic enhancement module and then combined with category embeddings to amplify cross-modal semantic consistency. With 32.27M trainable parameters, SHIFNet achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance on public benchmarks, reaching 89.8% on PST900 and 67.8% on FMB, respectively. The framework facilitates the adaptation of pre-trained large models to RGB-T segmentation tasks, effectively mitigating the high costs associated with data collection while endowing robotic systems with comprehensive perception capabilities.

Title: A Hypernetwork-Based Approach to KAN Representation of Audio Signals
Authors: Patryk Marszałek, Maciej Rut, Piotr Kawa, Piotr Syga
Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INR) have gained prominence for efficiently encoding multimedia data, yet their applications in audio signals remain limited. This study introduces the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), a novel architecture using learnable activation functions, as an effective INR model for audio representation. KAN demonstrates superior perceptual performance over previous INRs, achieving the lowest Log-SpectralDistance of 1.29 and the highest Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality of 3.57 for 1.5 s audio. To extend KAN's utility, we propose FewSound, a hypernetwork-based architecture that enhances INR parameter updates. FewSound outperforms the state-of-the-art HyperSound, with a 33.3% improvement in MSE and 60.87% in SI-SNR. These results show KAN as a robust and adaptable audio representation with the potential for scalability and integration into various hypernetwork frameworks.

Title: Resource-Efficient Affordance Grounding with Complementary Depth and Semantic Prompts
Authors: Yizhou Huang, Fan Yang, Guoliang Zhu, Gen Li, Hao Shi, Yukun Zuo, Wenrui Chen, Zhiyong Li, Kailun Yang
Abstract: Affordance refers to the functional properties that an agent perceives and utilizes from its environment, and is key perceptual information required for robots to perform actions. This information is rich and multimodal in nature. Existing multimodal affordance methods face limitations in extracting useful information, mainly due to simple structural designs, basic fusion methods, and large model parameters, making it difficult to meet the performance requirements for practical deployment. To address these issues, this paper proposes the BiT-Align image-depth-text affordance mapping framework. The framework includes a Bypass Prompt Module (BPM) and a Text Feature Guidance (TFG) attention selection mechanism. BPM integrates the auxiliary modality depth image directly as a prompt to the primary modality RGB image, embedding it into the primary modality encoder without introducing additional encoders. This reduces the model's parameter count and effectively improves functional region localization accuracy. The TFG mechanism guides the selection and enhancement of attention heads in the image encoder using textual features, improving the understanding of affordance characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant performance improvements on public AGD20K and HICO-IIF datasets. On the AGD20K dataset, compared with the current state-of-the-art method, we achieve a 6.0% improvement in the KLD metric, while reducing model parameters by 88.8%, demonstrating practical application values.

Title: A Framework for Uplink ISAC Receiver Designs: Performance Analysis and Algorithm Development
Authors: Zhiyuan Yu, Hong Ren, Cunhua Pan, Gui Zhou, Dongming Wang, Chau Yuen, Jiangzhou Wang
Abstract: Uplink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems have recently emerged as a promising research direction, enabling simultaneous uplink signal detection and target sensing. In this paper, we propose flexible projection (FP)-type receivers that unify the projection-type receivers and the successive interference cancellation (SIC)-type receivers by using a flexible tradeoff factor to adapt to dynamically changing uplink ISAC scenarios. The FP-type receivers address the joint signal detection and target response estimation problem through two coordinated phases: 1) Communication signal detection using a reconstructed signal whose composition is controlled by the tradeoff factor, followed by 2) Target response estimation performed through subtraction of the detected communication signal from the received signal. With adjustable tradeoff factors, the FP-type receivers can balance the enhancement of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) with the reduction of correlation in the reconstructed signal for communication signal detection. The pairwise error probabilities (PEPs) are analyzed for both maximum likelihood (ML) and zero-forcing (ZF) detectors, revealing that the optimal tradeoff factor should be determined based on the adopted detection algorithm and the relative power of the sensing and communication (S&C) signal. A homotopy optimization framework is first applied for the FP-type receivers with a fixed trade-off factor. This framework is then extended to develop dynamic FP (DFP)-type receivers, which iteratively adjust the trade-off factor for improved algorithm performance and environmental adaptability. Subsequently, two extensions are explored to further enhance the receivers' performance: parallel DFP (PDFP)-type receivers and a block-structured receiver design. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed receiver designs is verified via simulations.

Title: Learning-Based Passive Fault-Tolerant Control of a Quadrotor with Rotor Failure
Authors: Jiehao Chen, Kaidong Zhao, Zihan Liu, YanJie Li, Yunjiang Lou
Abstract: This paper proposes a learning-based passive fault-tolerant control (PFTC) method for quadrotor capable of handling arbitrary single-rotor failures, including conditions ranging from fault-free to complete rotor failure, without requiring any rotor fault information or controller switching. Unlike existing methods that treat rotor faults as disturbances and rely on a single controller for multiple fault scenarios, our approach introduces a novel Selector-Controller network structure. This architecture integrates fault detection module and the controller into a unified policy network, effectively combining the adaptability to multiple fault scenarios of PFTC with the superior control performance of active fault-tolerant control (AFTC). To optimize performance, the policy network is trained using a hybrid framework that synergizes reinforcement learning (RL), behavior cloning (BC), and supervised learning with fault information. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate the proposed method, demonstrating significant improvements in fault response speed and position tracking performance compared to state-of-the-art PFTC and AFTC approaches.

Title: TReND: Transformer derived features and Regularized NMF for neonatal functional network Delineation
Authors: Sovesh Mohapatra, Minhui Ouyang, Shufang Tan, Jianlin Guo, Lianglong Sun, Yong He, Hao Huang
Abstract: Precise parcellation of functional networks (FNs) of early developing human brain is the fundamental basis for identifying biomarker of developmental disorders and understanding functional development. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) enables in vivo exploration of functional changes, but adult FN parcellations cannot be directly applied to the neonates due to incomplete network maturation. No standardized neonatal functional atlas is currently available. To solve this fundamental issue, we propose TReND, a novel and fully automated self-supervised transformer-autoencoder framework that integrates regularized nonnegative matrix factorization (RNMF) to unveil the FNs in neonates. TReND effectively disentangles spatiotemporal features in voxel-wise rs-fMRI data. The framework integrates confidence-adaptive masks into transformer self-attention layers to mitigate noise influence. A self supervised decoder acts as a regulator to refine the encoder's latent embeddings, which serve as reliable temporal features. For spatial coherence, we incorporate brain surface-based geodesic distances as spatial encodings along with functional connectivity from temporal features. The TReND clustering approach processes these features under sparsity and smoothness constraints, producing robust and biologically plausible parcellations. We extensively validated our TReND framework on three different rs-fMRI datasets: simulated, dHCP and HCP-YA against comparable traditional feature extraction and clustering techniques. Our results demonstrated the superiority of the TReND framework in the delineation of neonate FNs with significantly better spatial contiguity and functional homogeneity. Collectively, we established TReND, a novel and robust framework, for neonatal FN delineation. TReND-derived neonatal FNs could serve as a neonatal functional atlas for perinatal populations in health and disease.

Title: Scalable Multi-Robot Task Allocation and Coordination under Signal Temporal Logic Specifications
Authors: Wenliang Liu, Nathalie Majcherczyk, Federico Pecora
Abstract: Motion planning with simple objectives, such as collision-avoidance and goal-reaching, can be solved efficiently using modern planners. However, the complexity of the allowed tasks for these planners is limited. On the other hand, signal temporal logic (STL) can specify complex requirements, but STL-based motion planning and control algorithms often face scalability issues, especially in large multi-robot systems with complex dynamics. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that leverages the best of the two worlds. We first use a single-robot motion planner to efficiently generate a set of alternative reference paths for each robot. Then coordination requirements are specified using STL, which is defined over the assignment of paths and robots' progress along those paths. We use a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) to compute task assignments and robot progress targets over time such that the STL specification is satisfied. Finally, a local controller is used to track the target progress. Simulations demonstrate that our method can handle tasks with complex constraints and scales to large multi-robot teams and intricate task allocation scenarios.

Title: InSerter: Speech Instruction Following with Unsupervised Interleaved Pre-training
Authors: Dingdong Wang, Jin Xu, Ruihang Chu, Zhifang Guo, Xiong Wang, Jincenzi Wu, Dongchao Yang, Shengpeng Ji, Junyang Lin
Abstract: Recent advancements in speech large language models (SpeechLLMs) have attracted considerable attention. Nonetheless, current methods exhibit suboptimal performance in adhering to speech instructions. Notably, the intelligence of models significantly diminishes when processing speech-form input as compared to direct text-form input. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this semantic inconsistency between speech and text representations through techniques such as representation and behavior alignment, which involve the meticulous design of data pairs during the post-training phase. In this paper, we introduce a simple and scalable training method called InSerter, which stands for Interleaved Speech-Text Representation Pre-training. InSerter is designed to pre-train large-scale unsupervised speech-text sequences, where the speech is synthesized from randomly selected segments of an extensive text corpus using text-to-speech conversion. Consequently, the model acquires the ability to generate textual continuations corresponding to the provided speech segments, obviating the need for intensive data design endeavors. To systematically evaluate speech instruction-following capabilities, we introduce SpeechInstructBench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for speech-oriented instruction-following tasks. Our proposed InSerter achieves SOTA performance in SpeechInstructBench and demonstrates superior or competitive results across diverse speech processing tasks.

Authors: Matteo Spanio, Massimiliano Zampini, Antonio Rodà, Franco Pierucci
Abstract: In recent decades, neuroscientific and psychological research has traced direct relationships between taste and auditory perceptions. This article explores multimodal generative models capable of converting taste information into music, building on this foundational research. We provide a brief review of the state of the art in this field, highlighting key findings and methodologies. We present an experiment in which a fine-tuned version of a generative music model (MusicGEN) is used to generate music based on detailed taste descriptions provided for each musical piece. The results are promising: according the participants' ($n=111$) evaluation, the fine-tuned model produces music that more coherently reflects the input taste descriptions compared to the non-fine-tuned model. This study represents a significant step towards understanding and developing embodied interactions between AI, sound, and taste, opening new possibilities in the field of generative AI. We release our dataset, code and pre-trained model at: this https URL.

Title: Language model integration based on memory control for sequence to sequence speech recognition
Authors: Jaejin Cho, Shinji Watanabe, Takaaki Hori, Murali Karthick Baskar, Hirofumi Inaguma, Jesus Villalba, Najim Dehak
Abstract: In this paper, we explore several new schemes to train a seq2seq model to integrate a pre-trained LM. Our proposed fusion methods focus on the memory cell state and the hidden state in the seq2seq decoder long short-term memory (LSTM), and the memory cell state is updated by the LM unlike the prior studies. This means the memory retained by the main seq2seq would be adjusted by the external LM. These fusion methods have several variants depending on the architecture of this memory cell update and the use of memory cell and hidden states which directly affects the final label inference. We performed the experiments to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods in a mono-lingual ASR setup on the Librispeech corpus and in a transfer learning setup from a multilingual ASR (MLASR) base model to a low-resourced language. In Librispeech, our best model improved WER by 3.7%, 2.4% for test clean, test other relatively to the shallow fusion baseline, with multi-level decoding. In transfer learning from an MLASR base model to the IARPA Babel Swahili model, the best scheme improved the transferred model on eval set by 9.9%, 9.8% in CER, WER relatively to the 2-stage transfer baseline.

Authors: Alon Harell, Yalda Foroutan, Nilesh Ahuja, Parual Datta, Bhavya Kanzariya, V. Srinivasa Somayazulu, Omesh Tickoo, Anderson de Andrade, Ivan V. Bajic
Abstract: Recent years have seen a tremendous growth in both the capability and popularity of automatic machine analysis of images and video. As a result, a growing need for efficient compression methods optimized for machine vision, rather than human vision, has emerged. To meet this growing demand, several methods have been developed for image and video coding for machines. Unfortunately, while there is a substantial body of knowledge regarding rate-distortion theory for human vision, the same cannot be said of machine analysis. In this paper, we extend the current rate-distortion theory for machines, providing insight into important design considerations of machine-vision codecs. We then utilize this newfound understanding to improve several methods for learnable image coding for machines. Our proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance on several computer vision tasks such as classification, instance segmentation, and object detection.

Title: Graph Neural Networks for Fast Contingency Analysis of Power Systems
Authors: Agnes M. Nakiganda, Spyros Chatzivasileiadis
Abstract: The successful integration of machine learning models into decision support tools for grid operation hinges on effectively capturing the topological changes in daily operations. Frequent grid reconfigurations and N-k security analyses have to be conducted to ensure a reliable and secure power grid, leading to a vast combinatorial space of possible topologies and operating states. This combinatorial complexity, which increases with grid size, poses a significant computational challenge for traditional solvers. In this paper, we combine Physics-Informed Neural Networks with graph-aware neural network architectures, i.e., a Guided-Dropout (GD) and an Edge-Varying Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture to learn the set points for a grid that considers all probable single-line reconfigurations (all critical N-1 scenarios) and subsequently apply the trained models to N-k scenarios. We demonstrate how incorporating the underlying physical equations for the network equations within the training procedure of the GD and the GNN architectures performs with N-1, N-2, and N-3 case studies. Using the AC Power Flow as a guiding application, we test our methods on the 6-bus, 24-bus, 57-bus, and 118-bus systems. We find that GNN not only achieves the task of contingency screening with satisfactory accuracy but does this up to 400 times faster than the Newton-Raphson power flow solver. Moreover, our results provide a comparison of the GD and GNN models in terms of accuracy and computational speed and provide recommendations on their adoption for contingency analysis of power systems.

Title: Learning a convex cost-to-go for single step model predictive control
Authors: E. M. Turan, Z. Mdoe, J. Jäschke
Abstract: For large uncertain systems, solving model predictive control problems online can be computationally taxing. Using a shorter prediction horizon can help, but may lead to poor performance and instability without appropriate modifications. This work focuses on learning convex objective terms to enable a single-step control horizon, reducing online computational costs. We consider two surrogates for approximating the cost-to-go: (1) a convex interpolating function and (2) an input-convex neural network. Regardless of the surrogate choice, its behavior near the origin and its ability to describe the feasible region are crucial for the closed-loop performance of the new MPC problem. We address this by tailoring the surrogate to ensure good performance in both aspects. We conclude with numerical examples, in which we compare the convex surrogates to using a standard neural network in the objective, solely using an LQR cost-to-go, and to using a neural network to learn a control policy. The proposed approaches are shown to achieve better performance with less data.

Title: Enhanced Multi-Target Tracking in Dynamic Environments: Distributed Flooding Control in the Random Finite Set Framework
Authors: Aidan Blair, Amirali Khodadadian Gostar, Alireza Bab-Hadiashar, Xiaodong Li, Reza Hoseinnezhad
Abstract: Tracking multiple targets in dynamic environments using distributed sensor networks is a challenging problem for situational awareness in connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). In such scenarios, the network of mobile sensors must coordinate their actions to accurately estimate the locations and trajectories of multiple targets, balancing limited computation and communication resources with multi-target tracking accuracy. Multi-sensor control methods can improve the performance of these networks by enabling efficient utilization of resources and enhancing the accuracy of the estimated target states. This paper proposes a novel multi-sensor control method that utilizes flooding-based communication to address this problem, ensuring distributed consensus of optimal sensor actions throughout the sensor network. Our method improves computational tractability and enables fully distributed control, ensuring the scalability and flexibility necessary for real-time CAV applications. Experimental results on several challenging multi-target tracking scenarios demonstrate that our approach significantly improves both multi-target tracking accuracy and computation time over competing methods.

Title: Nonparametric Control Koopman Operators
Authors: Petar Bevanda, Bas Driessen, Lucian Cristian Iacob, Stefan Sosnowski, Roland Tóth, Sandra Hirche
Abstract: This paper presents a novel Koopman (composition) operator representation framework for control systems in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) that is free of explicit dictionary or input parametrizations. By establishing fundamental equivalences between different model representations, we are able to close the gap of control system operator learning and infinite-dimensional regression, enabling various empirical estimators and the connection to well-understood learning theory in RKHSs under one unified framework. As a consequence, our proposed framework allows for arbitrary accurate finite-rank approximations in infinite-dimensional spaces and leads to finite-dimensional predictors without apriori restrictions to a finite span of functions or inputs. To enable applications to high-dimensional control systems, we improve the scalability of our proposed control Koopman operator estimates by utilizing sketching techniques. Numerical experiments demonstrate superior prediction accuracy compared to bilinear EDMD, especially in high dimensions. Finally, we show that our learned models are readily interfaced with linear-parameter-varying techniques for model predictive control.

Title: Convergence Analysis of Gradient Flow for Overparameterized LQR Formulations
Authors: Arthur Castello B. de Oliveira, Milad Siami, Eduardo D. Sontag
Abstract: Motivated by the growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in control design, this paper analyses the intersection between results from gradient methods for the model-free linear quadratic regulator (LQR), and linear feedforward neural networks (LFFNNs), More specifically, it looks into the case where one wants to find a LFFNN feedback that minimizes a LQR cost. This paper starts by analyzing the structure of the gradient expression for the parameters of each layer, which implies a key conservation law of the system. This conservation law is then leveraged to generalize existing results on boundedness and global convergence of solutions to critical points, and invariance of the set of stabilizing networks under the training dynamics. This is followed by an analysis of the case where the LFFNN has a single hidden layer, for which the paper proves that the training converges not only to the critical points, but to the optimal feedback control law for all but a set of Lebesgue measure zero of the initializations. These theoretical results are followed by an extensive analysis of a simple version of the problem -- the ``vector case'' -- proving the theoretical properties of accelerated convergence and small-input input-to-state stability (ISS) for this simpler example. Finally, the paper presents numerical evidence of faster convergence of the training of general LFFNNs when compared to non-overparameterized formulations, showing that the acceleration of the solution is observable even when the gradient is not explicitly computed, but estimated from evaluations of the cost function.

Title: Explainable AI for Autism Diagnosis: Identifying Critical Brain Regions Using fMRI Data
Authors: Suryansh Vidya, Kush Gupta, Amir Aly, Andy Wills, Emmanuel Ifeachor, Rohit Shankar
Abstract: Early diagnosis and intervention for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has been shown to significantly improve the quality of life of autistic individuals. However, diagnostics methods for ASD rely on assessments based on clinical presentation that are prone to bias and can be challenging to arrive at an early diagnosis. There is a need for objective biomarkers of ASD which can help improve diagnostic accuracy. Deep learning (DL) has achieved outstanding performance in diagnosing diseases and conditions from medical imaging data. Extensive research has been conducted on creating models that classify ASD using resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. However, existing models lack interpretability. This research aims to improve the accuracy and interpretability of ASD diagnosis by creating a DL model that can not only accurately classify ASD but also provide explainable insights into its working. The dataset used is a preprocessed version of the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) with 884 samples. Our findings show a model that can accurately classify ASD and highlight critical brain regions differing between ASD and typical controls, with potential implications for early diagnosis and understanding of the neural basis of ASD. These findings are validated by studies in the literature that use different datasets and modalities, confirming that the model actually learned characteristics of ASD and not just the dataset. This study advances the field of explainable AI in medical imaging by providing a robust and interpretable model, thereby contributing to a future with objective and reliable ASD diagnostics.

Title: Cooperative Maximum Likelihood Target Position Estimation for MIMO-ISAC Networks
Authors: Lorenzo Pucci, Tommaso Bacchielli, Andrea Giorgetti
Abstract: This letter investigates target position estimation in integrated sensing and communication networks composed of multiple cooperating monostatic base stations (BSs). Each BS employs a MIMO-orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) scheme, enabling the coexistence of communication and sensing. A general cooperative maximum likelihood (ML) framework is derived, directly estimating the target position in a common reference system rather than relying on local range and angle estimates at each BS. Positioning accuracy is evaluated in single-target scenarios by varying the number of collaborating BSs, using root mean square error (RMSE), and comparing against the square root of the Cramér-Rao lower bound. Numerical results demonstrate that the ML framework significantly reduces the position RMSE as the number of cooperating BSs increases.

Title: Generalized Gaussian Model for Learned Image Compression
Authors: Haotian Zhang, Li Li, Dong Liu
Abstract: In learned image compression, probabilistic models play an essential role in characterizing the distribution of latent variables. The Gaussian model with mean and scale parameters has been widely used for its simplicity and effectiveness. Probabilistic models with more parameters, such as the Gaussian mixture models, can fit the distribution of latent variables more precisely, but the corresponding complexity is higher. To balance the compression performance and complexity, we extend the Gaussian model to the generalized Gaussian family for more flexible latent distribution modeling, introducing only one additional shape parameter beta than the Gaussian model. To enhance the performance of the generalized Gaussian model by alleviating the train-test mismatch, we propose improved training methods, including beta-dependent lower bounds for scale parameters and gradient rectification. Our proposed generalized Gaussian model, coupled with the improved training methods, is demonstrated to outperform the Gaussian and Gaussian mixture models on a variety of learned image compression networks.

Title: Privacy Preservation in MIMO-OFDM Localization Systems: A Beamforming Approach
Authors: Yuchen Zhang, Hui Chen, Musa Furkan Keskin, Alireza Pourafzal, Pinjun Zheng, Henk Wymeersch, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri
Abstract: We investigate an uplink MIMO-OFDM localization scenario where a legitimate base station (BS) aims to localize a user equipment (UE) using pilot signals transmitted by the UE, while an unauthorized BS attempts to localize the UE by eavesdropping on these pilots, posing a risk to the UE's location privacy. To enhance legitimate localization performance while protecting the UE's privacy, we formulate an optimization problem regarding the beamformers at the UE, aiming to minimize the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for legitimate localization while constraining the CRB for unauthorized localization above a threshold. A penalty dual decomposition optimization framework is employed to solve the problem, leading to a novel beamforming approach for location privacy preservation. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach and demonstrate its superiority over existing benchmarks.

Title: A Frequency-aware Augmentation Network for Mental Disorders Assessment from Audio
Authors: Shuanglin Li, Siyang Song, Rajesh Nair, Syed Mohsen Naqvi
Abstract: Depression and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) stand out as the common mental health challenges today. In affective computing, speech signals serve as effective biomarkers for mental disorder assessment. Current research, relying on labor-intensive hand-crafted features or simplistic time-frequency representations, often overlooks critical details by not accounting for the differential impacts of various frequency bands and temporal fluctuations. Therefore, we propose a frequency-aware augmentation network with dynamic convolution for depression and ADHD assessment. In the proposed method, the spectrogram is used as the input feature and adopts a multi-scale convolution to help the network focus on discriminative frequency bands related to mental disorders. A dynamic convolution is also designed to aggregate multiple convolution kernels dynamically based upon their attentions which are input-independent to capture dynamic information. Finally, a feature augmentation block is proposed to enhance the feature representation ability and make full use of the captured information. Experimental results on AVEC 2014 and self-recorded ADHD dataset prove the robustness of our method, an RMSE of 9.23 was attained for estimating depression severity, along with an accuracy of 89.8\% in detecting ADHD.

Title: Efficient Probabilistic Assessment of Power System Resilience Using the Polynomial Chaos Expansion Method with Enhanced Stability
Authors: Aidan Gerkis, Xiaozhe Wang
Abstract: Increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events motivates the assessment of power system resilience. The random nature of power system failures during these events mandates probabilistic resilience assessment, but state-of-the-art methods are computationally inefficient. In this paper, an enhanced PCE method to quantify power system resilience based on the extended AC Cascading Failure Model (AC-CFM) model is proposed. To address repeatability issues arising from PCE computation with different sample sets, we propose a novel experiment design method. Numerical studies on the IEEE 39-bus system illustrate the improved repeatability and convergence of the method. The enhanced PCE method is then used to efficiently assess the system's resilience and propose adaptation measures.

Title: Optimized Beamforming for Joint Bistatic Positioning and Monostatic Sensing
Authors: Yuchen Zhang, Hui Chen, Pinjun Zheng, Boyu Ning, Henk Wymeersch, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri
Abstract: We investigate the performance tradeoff between \textit{bistatic positioning (BP)} and \textit{monostatic sensing (MS)} in a multi-input multi-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing scenario. We derive the Cramér-Rao bounds (CRBs) for BP at the user equipment and MS at the base station. To balance these objectives, we propose a multi-objective optimization framework that optimizes beamformers using a weighted-sum CRB approach, ensuring the weak Pareto boundary. We also introduce two mismatch-minimizing approaches, targeting beamformer mismatch and variance matrix mismatch, and solve them distinctly. Numerical results demonstrate the performance tradeoff between BP and MS, revealing significant gains with the proposed methods and highlighting the advantages of minimizing the weighted-sum mismatch of variance matrices.

Title: Positioning-Aided Channel Estimation for Multi-LEO Satellite Downlink Communications
Authors: Yuchen Zhang, Pinjun Zheng, Jie Ma, Henk Wymeersch, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri
Abstract: We investigate a multi-low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite system that simultaneously provides positioning and communication services to terrestrial user terminals. To address the challenges of channel estimation in LEO satellite systems, we propose a novel two-timescale positioning-aided channel estimation framework, exploiting the distinct variation rates of position-related parameters and channel gains inherent in LEO satellite channels. Using the misspecified Cramer-Rao bound (MCRB) theory, we systematically analyze positioning performance under practical imperfections, such as inter-satellite clock bias and carrier frequency offset. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate how position information derived from downlink positioning can enhance uplink channel estimation accuracy, even in the presence of positioning errors, through an MCRB-based analysis. To overcome the constraints of limited link budgets and communication rates associated with single-satellite-based communication, we develop a distributed beamforming strategy for downlink communication. This strategy allows LEO satellites to independently optimize their beamformers using local channel state information, eliminating the need for centralized processing while preserving the advantages of multi-satellite cooperative communication. Theoretical analyses and numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework in achieving high-precision downlink positioning under practical imperfections, facilitating uplink channel estimation, and enabling efficient downlink communication.

Title: MedFuncta: Modality-Agnostic Representations Based on Efficient Neural Fields
Authors: Paul Friedrich, Florentin Bieder, Philippe C. Cattin
Abstract: Recent research in medical image analysis with deep learning almost exclusively focuses on grid- or voxel-based data representations. We challenge this common choice by introducing MedFuncta, a modality-agnostic continuous data representation based on neural fields. We demonstrate how to scale neural fields from single instances to large datasets by exploiting redundancy in medical signals and by applying an efficient meta-learning approach with a context reduction scheme. We further address the spectral bias in commonly used SIREN activations, by introducing an $\omega_0$-schedule, improving reconstruction quality and convergence speed. We validate our proposed approach on a large variety of medical signals of different dimensions and modalities (1D: ECG; 2D: Chest X-ray, Retinal OCT, Fundus Camera, Dermatoscope, Colon Histopathology, Cell Microscopy; 3D: Brain MRI, Lung CT) and successfully demonstrate that we can solve relevant downstream tasks on these representations. We additionally release a large-scale dataset of > 550k annotated neural fields to promote research in this direction.

Title: Off-Policy Temporal Difference Learning for Perturbed Markov Decision Processes: Theoretical Insights and Extensive Simulations
Authors: Ali Forootani, Raffaele Iervolino, Massimo Tipaldi, Mohammad Khosravi
Abstract: Dynamic Programming suffers from the curse of dimensionality due to large state and action spaces, a challenge further compounded by uncertainties in the environment. To mitigate these issue, we explore an off-policy based Temporal Difference Approximate Dynamic Programming approach that preserves contraction mapping when projecting the problem into a subspace of selected features, accounting for the probability distribution of the perturbed transition probability matrix. We further demonstrate how this Approximate Dynamic Programming approach can be implemented as a particular variant of the Temporal Difference learning algorithm, adapted for handling perturbations. To validate our theoretical findings, we provide a numerical example using a Markov Decision Process corresponding to a resource allocation problem.

Title: Conformal Lyapunov Optimization: Optimal Resource Allocation under Deterministic Reliability Constraints
Authors: Francesco Binucci, Osvaldo Simeone, Paolo Banelli
Abstract: This paper introduces conformal Lyapunov optimization (CLO), a novel resource allocation framework for networked systems that optimizes average long-term objectives, while satisfying deterministic long-term reliability constraints. Unlike traditional Lyapunov optimization (LO), which addresses resource allocation tasks under average long-term constraints, CLO provides formal worst-case deterministic reliability guarantees. This is achieved by integrating the standard LO optimization framework with online conformal risk control (O-CRC), an adaptive update mechanism controlling long-term risks. The effectiveness of CLO is verified via experiments for hierarchal edge inference targeting image segmentation tasks in a networked computing architecture. Specifically, simulation results confirm that CLO can control reliability constraints, measured via the false negative rate of all the segmentation decisions made in the network, while at the same time minimizing the weighted sum of energy consumption and imprecision, with the latter accounting for the rate of false positives.

Title: LLaSE-G1: Incentivizing Generalization Capability for LLaMA-based Speech Enhancement
Authors: Boyi Kang, Xinfa Zhu, Zihan Zhang, Zhen Ye, Mingshuai Liu, Ziqian Wang, Yike Zhu, Guobin Ma, Jun Chen, Longshuai Xiao, Chao Weng, Wei Xue, Lei Xie
Abstract: Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in semantic understanding and contextual modeling, which have flourished in generative speech enhancement (SE). However, many LM-based SE approaches primarily focus on semantic information, often neglecting the critical role of acoustic information, which leads to acoustic inconsistency after enhancement and limited generalization across diverse SE tasks. In this paper, we introduce LLaSE-G1, a LLaMA-based language model that incentivizes generalization capabilities for speech enhancement. LLaSE-G1 offers the following key contributions: First, to mitigate acoustic inconsistency, LLaSE-G1 employs continuous representations from WavLM as input and predicts speech tokens from X-Codec2, maximizing acoustic preservation. Second, to promote generalization capability, LLaSE-G1 introduces dual-channel inputs and outputs, unifying multiple SE tasks without requiring task-specific IDs. Third, LLaSE-G1 outperforms prior task-specific discriminative and generative SE models, demonstrating scaling effects at test time and emerging capabilities for unseen SE tasks. Additionally, we release our code and models to support further research in this area.

Title: Optimizing Parameter Estimation for Electrochemical Battery Model: A Comparative Analysis of Operating Profiles on Computational Efficiency and Accuracy
Authors: Feng Guo, Luis D. Couto, Khiem Trad, Grietus Mulder, Keivan Haghverdi, Guillaume Thenaisie
Abstract: Parameter estimation in electrochemical models remains a significant challenge in their application. This study investigates the impact of different operating profiles on electrochemical model parameter estimation to identify the optimal conditions. In particular, the present study is focused on Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide(NMC) lithium-ion batteries. Based on five fundamental current profiles (C/5, C/2, 1C, Pulse, DST), 31 combinations of conditions were generated and used for parameter estimation and validation, resulting in 961 evaluation outcomes. The Particle Swarm Optimization is employed for parameter identification in electrochemical models, specifically using the Single Particle Model (SPM). The analysis considered three dimensions: model voltage output error, parameter estimation error, and time cost. Results show that using all five profiles (C/5, C/2, 1C, Pulse, DST) minimizes voltage output error, while {C/5, C/2, Pulse, DST} minimizes parameter estimation error. The shortest time cost is achieved with {1C}. When considering both model voltage output and parameter errors, {C/5, C/2, 1C, DST} is optimal. For minimizing model voltage output error and time cost, {C/2, 1C} is best, while {1C} is ideal for parameter error and time cost. The comprehensive optimal condition is {C/5, C/2, 1C, DST}. These findings provide guidance for selecting current conditions tailored to specific needs.

Title: Graph-Based Dynamics and Network Control of a Single Articulated Robotic System
Authors: Jonathan Lane, Nak-seung Patrick Hyun
Abstract: Extensive research on graph-based dynamics and control of multi-agent systems has successfully demonstrated control of robotic swarms, where each robot is perceived as an independent agent virtually connected by a network topology. The strong advantage of the network control structure lies in the decentralized nature of the control action, which only requires the knowledge of virtually connected agents. In this paper, we seek to expand the ideas of virtual network constraints to physical constraints on a class of tree-structured robots which we denote as single articulated robotic (SAR) systems. In our proposed framework, each link can be viewed as an agent, and each holonomic constraint connecting links serves as an edge. By following the first principles of Lagrangian dynamics, we derive a consensus-like matrix-differential equation with weighted graph and edge Laplacians for the dynamics of a SAR system. The sufficient condition for the holonomic constraint forces becoming independent to the control inputs is derived. This condition leads to a decentralized leader-follower network control framework for regulating the relative configuration of the robot. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.

Title: Metric-Guided Conformal Bounds for Probabilistic Image Reconstruction
Authors: Matt Y Cheung, Tucker J Netherton, Laurence E Court, Ashok Veeraraghavan, Guha Balakrishnan
Abstract: Modern deep learning reconstruction algorithms generate impressively realistic scans from sparse inputs, but can often produce significant inaccuracies. This makes it difficult to provide statistically guaranteed claims about the true state of a subject from scans reconstructed by these algorithms. In this study, we propose a framework for computing provably valid prediction bounds on claims derived from probabilistic black-box image reconstruction algorithms. The key insights behind our framework are to represent reconstructed scans with a derived clinical metric of interest, and to calibrate bounds on the ground truth metric with conformal prediction (CP) using a prior calibration dataset. These bounds convey interpretable feedback about the subject's state, and can also be used to retrieve nearest-neighbor reconstructed scans for visual inspection. We demonstrate the utility of this framework on sparse-view computed tomography (CT) for fat mass quantification and radiotherapy planning tasks. Results show that our framework produces bounds with better semantical interpretation than conventional pixel-based bounding approaches. Furthermore, we can flag dangerous outlier reconstructions that look plausible but have statistically unlikely metric values.

Title: Equivariant Filter for Tightly Coupled LiDAR-Inertial Odometry
Authors: Anbo Tao, Yarong Luo, Chunxi Xia, Chi Guo, Xingxing Li
Abstract: Pose estimation is a crucial problem in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). However, developing a robust and consistent state estimator remains a significant challenge, as the traditional extended Kalman filter (EKF) struggles to handle the model nonlinearity, especially for inertial measurement unit (IMU) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR). To provide a consistent and efficient solution of pose estimation, we propose Eq-LIO, a robust state estimator for tightly coupled LIO systems based on an equivariant filter (EqF). Compared with the invariant Kalman filter based on the $\SE_2(3)$ group structure, the EqF uses the symmetry of the semi-direct product group to couple the system state including IMU bias, navigation state and LiDAR extrinsic calibration state, thereby suppressing linearization error and improving the behavior of the estimator in the event of unexpected state changes. The proposed Eq-LIO owns natural consistency and higher robustness, which is theoretically proven with mathematical derivation and experimentally verified through a series of tests on both public and private datasets.

Authors: Ahmed Adel Attia, Dorottya Demszky, Tolulope Ogunremi, Jing Liu, Carol Espy-Wilson
Abstract: Creating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems that are robust and resilient to classroom conditions is paramount to the development of AI tools to aid teachers and students. In this work, we study the efficacy of continued pretraining (CPT) in adapting Wav2vec2.0 to the classroom domain. We show that CPT is a powerful tool in that regard and reduces the Word Error Rate (WER) of Wav2vec2.0-based models by upwards of 10%. More specifically, CPT improves the model's robustness to different noises, microphones and classroom conditions.

Title: Learning to Refine Input Constrained Control Barrier Functions via Uncertainty-Aware Online Parameter Adaptation
Authors: Taekyung Kim, Robin Inho Kee, Dimitra Panagou
Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have become powerful tools for ensuring safety in nonlinear systems. However, finding valid CBFs that guarantee persistent safety and feasibility remains an open challenge, especially in systems with input constraints. Traditional approaches often rely on manually tuning the parameters of the class K functions of the CBF conditions a priori. The performance of CBF-based controllers is highly sensitive to these fixed parameters, potentially leading to overly conservative behavior or safety violations. To overcome these issues, this paper introduces a learning-based optimal control framework for online adaptation of Input Constrained CBF (ICCBF) parameters in discrete-time nonlinear systems. Our method employs a probabilistic ensemble neural network to predict the performance and risk metrics, as defined in this work, for candidate parameters, accounting for both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We propose a two-step verification process using Jensen-Renyi Divergence and distributionally-robust Conditional Value at Risk to identify valid parameters. This enables dynamic refinement of ICCBF parameters based on current state and nearby environments, optimizing performance while ensuring safety within the verified parameter set. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms both fixed-parameter and existing adaptive methods in robot navigation scenarios across safety and performance metrics.

Title: Beamforming Optimization for Continuous Aperture Array (CAPA)-based Communications
Authors: Zhaolin Wang, Chongjun Ouyang, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: The beamforming optimization in continuous aperture array (CAPA)-based multi-user communications is studied. In contrast to conventional spatially discrete antenna arrays, CAPAs can exploit the full spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) by emitting information-bearing electromagnetic (EM) waves through continuous source current distributed across the aperture. Nevertheless, such an operation renders the beamforming optimization problem as a non-convex integral-based functional programming problem, which is challenging for conventional discrete optimization methods. A couple of low-complexity approaches are proposed to solve the functional programming problem. 1) Calculus of variations (CoV)-based approach: Closed-form structure of the optimal continuous source patterns are derived based on CoV, inspiring a low-complexity integral-free iterative algorithm for solving the functional programming problem. 2) Correlation-based zero-forcing (Corr-ZF) approach: Closed-form ZF source current patterns that completely eliminate the inter-user interference are derived based on the channel correlations. By using these patterns, the original functional programming problem is transformed to a simple power allocation problem, which can be solved using the classical water-filling approach with reduced complexity. Our numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed designs and reveal that: i) compared to the state-of-the-art Fourier-based discretization approach, the proposed CoV-based approach not only improves communication performance but also reduces computational complexity by up to hundreds of times for large CAPA apertures and high frequencies, and ii) the proposed Corr-ZF approach achieves asymptotically optimal performance compared to the CoV-based approach.

Title: Improving Pronunciation and Accent Conversion through Knowledge Distillation And Synthetic Ground-Truth from Native TTS
Authors: Tuan Nam Nguyen, Seymanur Akti, Ngoc Quan Pham, Alexander Waibel
Abstract: Previous approaches on accent conversion (AC) mainly aimed at making non-native speech sound more native while maintaining the original content and speaker identity. However, non-native speakers sometimes have pronunciation issues, which can make it difficult for listeners to understand them. Hence, we developed a new AC approach that not only focuses on accent conversion but also improves pronunciation of non-native accented speaker. By providing the non-native audio and the corresponding transcript, we generate the ideal ground-truth audio with native-like pronunciation with original duration and prosody. This ground-truth data aids the model in learning a direct mapping between accented and native speech. We utilize the end-to-end VITS framework to achieve high-quality waveform reconstruction for the AC task. As a result, our system not only produces audio that closely resembles native accents and while retaining the original speaker's identity but also improve pronunciation, as demonstrated by evaluation results.

Title: DECT-2020 NR Link Distance Performance in Varying Environments: Models and Measurements
Authors: Md Mohaiminul Haque, Joonas Sae, Juho Pirskanen, Mikko Valkama
Abstract: Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications 2020 New Radio (DECT-2020 NR) has garnered recognition as an alternative for cellular 5G technology in the internet of things industry. This paper presents a study centered around the analysis of the link distance performance in varying environments for DECT-2020 NR. The study extensively examines and analyzes received signal strength indicator and resulting path loss values in comparison with theoretical models, as well as packet success rates (SR) and signal-to-noise ratio against varying distances. The measurements show that with an SR of over 90%, an antenna height of 1.5 m, indoor link distances with a single device-to-device connection with 0 dBm transmission (TX) power can reach over 60 m in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) areas and up to 190 m in LOS areas with smaller -8 dBm TX power. Similarly, for outdoor use cases, link distances of over 600 m can be reached with +19 dBm TX power.

Title: Game-Theoretic Defenses for Robust Conformal Prediction Against Adversarial Attacks in Medical Imaging
Authors: Rui Luo, Jie Bao, Zhixin Zhou, Chuangyin Dang
Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose significant threats to the reliability and safety of deep learning models, especially in critical domains such as medical imaging. This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates conformal prediction with game-theoretic defensive strategies to enhance model robustness against both known and unknown adversarial perturbations. We address three primary research questions: constructing valid and efficient conformal prediction sets under known attacks (RQ1), ensuring coverage under unknown attacks through conservative thresholding (RQ2), and determining optimal defensive strategies within a zero-sum game framework (RQ3). Our methodology involves training specialized defensive models against specific attack types and employing maximum and minimum classifiers to aggregate defenses effectively. Extensive experiments conducted on the MedMNIST datasets, including PathMNIST, OrganAMNIST, and TissueMNIST, demonstrate that our approach maintains high coverage guarantees while minimizing prediction set sizes. The game-theoretic analysis reveals that the optimal defensive strategy often converges to a singular robust model, outperforming uniform and simple strategies across all evaluated datasets. This work advances the state-of-the-art in uncertainty quantification and adversarial robustness, providing a reliable mechanism for deploying deep learning models in adversarial environments.

Title: CalibRefine: Deep Learning-Based Online Automatic Targetless LiDAR-Camera Calibration with Iterative and Attention-Driven Post-Refinement
Authors: Lei Cheng, Lihao Guo, Tianya Zhang, Tam Bang, Austin Harris, Mustafa Hajij, Mina Sartipi, Siyang Cao
Abstract: Accurate multi-sensor calibration is essential for deploying robust perception systems in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and intelligent transportation. Existing LiDAR-camera calibration methods often rely on manually placed targets, preliminary parameter estimates, or intensive data preprocessing, limiting their scalability and adaptability in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a fully automatic, targetless, and online calibration framework, CalibRefine, which directly processes raw LiDAR point clouds and camera images. Our approach is divided into four stages: (1) a Common Feature Discriminator that trains on automatically detected objects--using relative positions, appearance embeddings, and semantic classes--to generate reliable LiDAR-camera correspondences, (2) a coarse homography-based calibration, (3) an iterative refinement to incrementally improve alignment as additional data frames become available, and (4) an attention-based refinement that addresses non-planar distortions by leveraging a Vision Transformer and cross-attention mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on two urban traffic datasets, we show that CalibRefine delivers high-precision calibration results with minimal human involvement, outperforming state-of-the-art targetless methods and remaining competitive with, or surpassing, manually tuned baselines. Our findings highlight how robust object-level feature matching, together with iterative and self-supervised attention-based adjustments, enables consistent sensor fusion in complex, real-world conditions without requiring ground-truth calibration matrices or elaborate data preprocessing.

Abstract: Accurate and robust state estimation at nighttime is essential for autonomous robotic navigation to achieve nocturnal or round-the-clock tasks. An intuitive question arises: Can low-cost standard cameras be exploited for nocturnal state estimation? Regrettably, most existing visual methods may fail under adverse illumination conditions, even with active lighting or image enhancement. A pivotal insight, however, is that streetlights in most urban scenarios act as stable and salient prior visual cues at night, reminiscent of stars in deep space aiding spacecraft voyage in interstellar navigation. Inspired by this, we propose Night-Voyager, an object-level nocturnal vision-aided state estimation framework that leverages prior object maps and keypoints for versatile localization. We also find that the primary limitation of conventional visual methods under poor lighting conditions stems from the reliance on pixel-level metrics. In contrast, metric-agnostic, non-pixel-level object detection serves as a bridge between pixel-level and object-level spaces, enabling effective propagation and utilization of object map information within the system. Night-Voyager begins with a fast initialization to solve the global localization problem. By employing an effective two-stage cross-modal data association, the system delivers globally consistent state updates using map-based observations. To address the challenge of significant uncertainties in visual observations at night, a novel matrix Lie group formulation and a feature-decoupled multi-state invariant filter are introduced, ensuring consistent and efficient estimation. Through comprehensive experiments in both simulation and diverse real-world scenarios (spanning approximately 12.3 km), Night-Voyager showcases its efficacy, robustness, and efficiency, filling a critical gap in nocturnal vision-aided state estimation.

Title: SAR-W-MixMAE: SAR Foundation Model Training Using Backscatter Power Weighting
Authors: Ali Caglayan, Nevrez Imamoglu, Toru Kouyama
Abstract: Foundation model approaches such as masked auto-encoders (MAE) or its variations are now being successfully applied to satellite imagery. Most of the ongoing technical validation of foundation models have been applied to optical images like RGB or multi-spectral images. Due to difficulty in semantic labeling to create datasets and higher noise content with respect to optical images, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data has not been explored a lot in the field for foundation models. Therefore, in this work as a pre-training approach, we explored masked auto-encoder, specifically MixMAE on Sentinel-1 SAR images and its impact on SAR image classification tasks. Moreover, we proposed to use the physical characteristic of SAR data for applying weighting parameter on the auto-encoder training loss (MSE) to reduce the effect of speckle noise and very high values on the SAR images. Proposed SAR intensity-based weighting of the reconstruction loss demonstrates promising results both on SAR pre-training and downstream tasks specifically on flood detection compared with the baseline model.

Title: A Multi-Sensor Fusion Approach for Rapid Orthoimage Generation in Large-Scale UAV Mapping
Authors: Jialei He, Zhihao Zhan, Zhituo Tu, Xiang Zhu, Jie Yuan
Abstract: Rapid generation of large-scale orthoimages from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has been a long-standing focus of research in the field of aerial mapping. A multi-sensor UAV system, integrating the Global Positioning System (GPS), Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), 4D millimeter-wave radar and camera, can provide an effective solution to this problem. In this paper, we utilize multi-sensor data to overcome the limitations of conventional orthoimage generation methods in terms of temporal performance, system robustness, and geographic reference accuracy. A prior-pose-optimized feature matching method is introduced to enhance matching speed and accuracy, reducing the number of required features and providing precise references for the Structure from Motion (SfM) process. The proposed method exhibits robustness in low-texture scenes like farmlands, where feature matching is difficult. Experiments show that our approach achieves accurate feature matching orthoimage generation in a short time. The proposed drone system effectively aids in farmland detection and management.
