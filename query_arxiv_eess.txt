Title: Colormap-Enhanced Vision Transformers for MRI-Based Multiclass (4-Class) Alzheimer's Disease Classification
Authors: Faisal Ahmed
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a pivotal role in the early diagnosis and monitoring of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the subtle structural variations in brain MRI scans often pose challenges for conventional deep learning models to extract discriminative features effectively. In this work, we propose PseudoColorViT-Alz, a colormap-enhanced Vision Transformer framework designed to leverage pseudo-color representations of MRI images for improved Alzheimer's disease classification. By combining colormap transformations with the global feature learning capabilities of Vision Transformers, our method amplifies anatomical texture and contrast cues that are otherwise subdued in standard grayscale MRI scans. We evaluate PseudoColorViT-Alz on the OASIS-1 dataset using a four-class classification setup (non-demented, moderate dementia, mild dementia, and very mild dementia). Our model achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 99.79% with an AUC of 100%, surpassing the performance of recent 2024--2025 methods, including CNN-based and Siamese-network approaches, which reported accuracies ranging from 96.1% to 99.68%. These results demonstrate that pseudo-color augmentation combined with Vision Transformers can significantly enhance MRI-based Alzheimer's disease classification. PseudoColorViT-Alz offers a robust and interpretable framework that outperforms current methods, providing a promising tool to support clinical decision-making and early detection of Alzheimer's disease.

Title: Packet Detection in a Filter Bank-Based Ultra-Wideband Communication System
Authors: Brian Nelson, Behrouz Farhang-Boroujeny
Abstract: Recently, filter bank multi-carrier spread spectrum (FBMC-SS) technology has been proposed for use in ultra-wideband (UWB) communication systems. It has been noted that, due to the spectral partitioning properties of the filter banks, a UWB signal can be synthesized and processed using a parallel set of signal processors operating at a moderate rate. This transceiver architecture can be used to generate UWB signals, without requiring a high-rate analog-to-digital and/or digital-to-analog converter. In this paper, beginning with a design operating on a single signal processor, we explore the development of a packet detector using the Rao score test. Taking advantage of the FBMC-SS signal structure, an effective detector design based on a cascade channelizer is proposed. We refer to this design as singe-radio band (SRB) detector. Given the typical bandwidth of UWB systems ($\bf 500$~MHz or wider), the SRB detector has to operate at a fast sampling rate of greater than $\bf 500$~MHz. This may be undesirable, as low cost analog-to-digital (ADC) and digital-to-analog (DAC) converters are often limited to a sampling rate of $\bf 200$~MHz or lower. Taking note of this point, the proposed SRB detector is extended to a multi-radio band (MRB) detector, where a set of parallel signal processors operating at a moderate sampling rate are used for a more practical implementation of the detector. Through computer simulations, we show that SRB and MRB detectors have the same performance in typical UWB channels. Finally, we provide results from an over-the-air demonstration of a UWB design occupying $\bf 1.28$~GHz of bandwidth. We find that reliable detection performance is possible in the harshest environments, at signal-to-noise ratios as low as $\bf -40$~dB with a preamble length of approximately half the duration of longest preamble length recommended in the IEEE802.15.4 standard.

Title: Perception-Limited Smooth Safety Filtering
Authors: Lyes Smaili, Soulaimane Berkane
Abstract: This paper develops a smooth safety-filtering framework for nonlinear control-affine systems under limited perception. Classical Control Barrier Function (CBF) filters assume global availability of the safety function - its value and gradient must be known everywhere - an assumption incompatible with sensing-limited settings, and the resulting filters often exhibit nonsmooth switching when constraints activate. We propose two complementary perception-aware safety filters applicable to general control-invariant safety sets. The first introduces a smooth perception gate that modulates barrier constraints based on sensing range, yielding a closed-form Lipschitz-safe controller with forward-invariance guarantees. The second replaces the hard CBF constraint with a differentiable penalty term, leading to a smooth unconstrained optimization-based safety filter consistent with CBF principles. For both designs, we establish existence, uniqueness, and forward invariance of the closed-loop trajectories. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed smooth filters enable the synthesis of higher-order tracking controllers for systems such as drones and second-order ground robots, offering substantially smoother and more robust safety-critical behaviors than classical CBF-based filters.

Title: Dirichlet Meets Horvitz and Thompson: Estimating Homophily in Large Networks via Sampling
Authors: Hamed Ajorlou, Gonzalo Mateos, Luana Ruiz
Abstract: Assessing homophily in large-scale networks is central to understanding structural regularities in graphs, and thus inform the choice of models (such as graph neural networks) adopted to learn from network data. Evaluation of smoothness metrics requires access to the entire network topology and node features, which may be impractical in several large-scale, dynamic, resource-limited, or privacy-constrained settings. In this work, we propose a sampling-based framework to estimate homophily via the Dirichlet energy (Laplacian-based total variation) of graph signals, leveraging the Horvitz-Thompson (HT) estimator for unbiased inference from partial graph observations. The Dirichlet energy is a so-termed total (of squared nodal feature deviations) over graph edges; hence, estimable under general network sampling designs for which edge-inclusion probabilities can be analytically derived and used as weights in the proposed HT estimator. We establish that the Dirichlet energy can be consistently estimated from sampled graphs, and empirically study other heterophily measures as well. Experiments on several heterophilic benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HT estimators in reliably capturing homophilic structure (or lack thereof) from sampled network measurements.

Title: Kalman Filter-based Mobile User-RIS Channel Estimation and User Localization
Authors: Ju Zhuoxuan, Doroslovacki Milos
Abstract: In communication networks, channel estimation and user localization are challenging problems in harsh environments or signal-blocked areas. This paper introduces a novel approach to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) in channel estimation between mobile users and rectangular Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) within wireless communication systems. Meanwhile, the user localization is realized based on the estimated Channel State Information (CSI). In this paper, we assume a non-linear, user's position-dependent system model, for a user with high mobility, an RIS with multiple elements, and a base station (BS) with multiple antennas. After that, we apply the Kalman Filtering (KF) like algorithms to reduce MSE in estimating parameters of this time-variant channel model. Additionally, we propose a Non-Circular Noise Kalman Filter (NCNKF) to address scenarios with non-circular complex state-space noise. Furthermore, we apply the Discrete Space Fourier Transform (DSFT) method, combined with the interpolation techniques to decrease the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for the user localization based on the estimated CSI. Finally, we extend the single-user case into the multi-user situation. Results show that KF can achieve lower MSE in estimating the channel than other known approaches, while the NCNKF algorithm has better performance in non-circular state-space noise scenarios. At the same time, the DSFT interpolation outperforms the other approaches with lower complexity. The study concludes with numerical comparisons and an in-depth discussion of the performance improvements enabled by our approaches.

Title: Deep Learning-Enabled Multi-Tag Detection in Ambient Backscatter Communications
Authors: Talha Akyildiz, Hessam Mahdavifar
Abstract: Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) enables battery-free connectivity by letting passive tags modulate existing RF signals, but reliable detection of multiple tags is challenging due to strong direct link interference, very weak backscatter signals, and an exponentially large joint state space. Classical multi-hypothesis likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) are optimal for this task when perfect channel state information (CSI) is available, yet in AmBC such CSI is difficult to obtain and track because the RF source is uncooperative and the tags are low-power passive devices. We first derive analytical performance bounds for an LRT receiver with perfect CSI to serve as a benchmark. We then propose two complementary deep learning frameworks that relax the CSI requirement while remaining modulation-agnostic. EmbedNet is an end-to-end prototypical network that maps covariance features of the received signal directly to multi-tag states. ChanEstNet is a hybrid scheme in which a convolutional neural network estimates effective channel coefficients from pilot symbols and passes them to a conventional LRT for interpretable multi-hypothesis detection. Simulations over diverse ambient sources and system configurations show that the proposed methods substantially reduce bit error rate, closely track the LRT benchmark, and significantly outperform energy detection baselines, especially as the number of tags increases.

Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning-Aided Strategies for Big Data Offloading in Vehicular Networks
Authors: Talha Akyildiz, Hessam Mahdavifar
Abstract: We consider vehicular networking scenarios where existing vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links can be leveraged for an effective uploading of large-size data to the network. In particular, we consider a group of vehicles where one vehicle can be designated as the \textit{leader} and other \textit{follower} vehicles can offload their data to the leader vehicle or directly upload it to the base station (or a combination of the two). In our proposed framework, the leader vehicle is responsible for receiving the data from other vehicles and processing it in order to remove the redundancy (deduplication) before uploading it to the base station. We present a mathematical framework of the considered network and formulate two separate optimization problems for minimizing (i) total time and (ii) total energy consumption by vehicles for uploading their data to the base station. We employ deep reinforcement learning (DRL) tools to obtain solutions in a dynamic vehicular network where network parameters (e.g., vehicle locations and channel coefficients) vary over time. Our results demonstrate that the application of DRL is highly beneficial, and data offloading with deduplication can significantly reduce the time and energy consumption. Furthermore, we present comprehensive numerical results to validate our findings and compare them with alternative approaches to show the benefits of the proposed DRL methods.

Title: BM4D-PC: nonlocal volumetric denoising of principal components of diffusion-weighted MR images
Authors: Vinicius P. Campos, Diego Szczupak, Tales Santini, Afonso C. Silva, Alessandro Foi, Marcelo A. C. Vieira, Corey A. Baron
Abstract: Purpose: Noise in diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) is often spatially correlated due to different acquisition and reconstruction strategies, which is not fully accounted for in current denoising strategies. Thus, we propose a novel model-based denoising method for dMRI that effectively accounts for the different noise characteristics of data. Methods: We propose a denoising strategy that incorporates full noise statistics, including the noise power spectral density (PSD), by leveraging the BM4D algorithm. Furthermore, to exploit redundancy across the diffusion MRI dataset, BM4D is applied to principal components (PC) of diffusion-weighted images (DWI) obtained through principal component analysis (PCA) decomposition of the entire DWI dataset, an approach we refer to as BM4D-PC. Importantly, our method also allows for direct estimation of both the noise map and PSD. We evaluated BM4D-PC against four existing state-of-the-art methods using in-silico and in vivo datasets, including high-resolution human and marmoset acquisitions. Results: Overall, BM4D-PC presented the best results for the metrics PSNR, SSIM and RMSE on the in-silico experiments. The in-vivo studies also showed that BM4D-PC dramatically enhanced the image quality of raw DWIs, outperforming existing denoising methods in terms of noise suppression and detail preservation, leading to improved quality of diffusion metrics. Conclusion: The proposed BM4D-PC method demonstrated state-of-the-art denoising results for dMRI using datasets from various acquisition strategies and image resolutions, potentially supporting future advances in neuroscience research.

Title: RSMA-Assited and Transceiver-Coordinated ICI Management for MIMO-OFDM System
Authors: Hengyu Zhang, Xuehan Wang, Xu Shi, Jintao Wang, Zhaohui Yang
Abstract: High-mobility scenarios are becoming increasingly critical in next-generation communication systems. While multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) stands as a prominent technology, its performance in such scenarios is fundamentally limited by Doppler-induced inter-carrier interference (ICI). Rate splitting multiple access (RSMA), recognized as a key multiple access technique for future communications, demonstrates superior interference management capabilities that we leverage to address this challenge. In specific, we propose a novel RSMA-assisted and transceiver-coordinated transmission scheme for ICI management in MIMO-OFDM system: (1) At the receiver side, we develop a hybrid successive interference cancellation (SIC) architecture with dynamic subcarrier clustering, which enables parallel intra-cluster and serial inter-cluster processing to balance complexity and performance. (2) At the transmitter~side, we design a matched hybrid precoding through formulated sum-rate maximization, solved via our proposed augmented boundary-compressed particle swarm optimization (ABC-PSO) algorithm for analog phase optimization and weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE)-based digital precoding iteration. Simulation results show that our scheme brings effective ICI suppression and enhanced system capacity with controlled complexity.

Title: Cooperative Energy Scheduling of Multi-Microgrids Based on Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Rongxiang Zhang, Bo Li, Jinghua Li, Yuguang Song, Ziqing Zhu, Wentao Yang, Zhengmao Li, Edris Pouresmaeil, Joshua Y. Kim
Abstract: With the rapid development of distributed renewable energy, multi-microgrids play an increasingly important role in improving the flexibility and reliability of energy supply. Reinforcement learning has shown great potential in coordination strategies due to its model-free nature. Current methods lack explicit quantification of the relationship between individual and joint risk values, resulting in obscured credit assignment. Moreover, they often depend on explicit communication, which becomes inefficient as system complexity grows. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning framework with shared memory (RRL-SM) for multi-microgrid scheduling. Specifically, a risk-sensitive value factorization scheme is proposed to quantify the relationship between individual and joint risk values by leveraging distributional modeling and attention-based representations, thereby aligning local decisions with global risk objectives. An implicit shared-memory coordination mechanism is implemented through a global memory space to enhance the overall efficiency of decentralized decision-making. Collectively, the integrated approach delivers more reliable cooperative scheduling under renewable energy uncertainty. Simulation results show that RRL-SM reduces load-shedding risk by 84.5%, demonstrating a favorable balance between reliability and economic performance.

Title: Uncertainty-Aware 3D UAV Tracking Using Single-Anchor UWB Measurements
Authors: Yuqi Ping, Junwei Wu, Bofeng Zheng, Fan Liu, Tianhao Liang, Tingting Zhang
Abstract: In this letter, we present an uncertainty-aware single-anchor Ultra-Wideband (UWB)-based 3D tracking framework. Specifically, a mobile Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) maintains a desired standoff distance to a moving target using range and 3D bearing measurements from a multi-antenna UWB anchor rigidly mounted on the UAV. To enhance the stability and safety under measurement degradation and motion uncertainty, we jointly design a robust factor-graph-based target localization method and a covariance-aware control Lyapunov function--control barrier function (CLF--CBF) tracking controller. This controller adaptively adjusts distance bounds and safety margins based on the posterior target covariance provided by the factor graph. The proposed system is evaluated through numerical simulations and real-world experiments carried out in a narrow indoor corridor environment.

Title: Near-Field Position and Orientation Tracking With Hybrid ELAA Architecture
Authors: Lin Chen, Xiaojun Yuan, Ying-Jun Angela Zhang
Abstract: This paper investigates near-field (NF) position and orientation tracking of a multi-antenna mobile station (MS) using an extremely large antenna array (ELAA)-equipped base station (BS) with a limited number of radio frequency (RF) chains. Under this hybrid array architecture, the received uplink pilot signal at the BS is first combined by analog phase shifters, producing a low-dimensional observation before digital processing. Such analog compression provides only partial access to the ELAA measurement, making it essential to design an analog combiner that can preserve pose-relevant signal components despite channel uncertainty and unit-modulus hardware constraints. To address this, we propose a predictive analog combining-assisted extended Kalman filter (PAC-EKF) framework, where the analog combiner can leverage the temporal correlation in the MS pose variation to capture the most informative signal components predictively. We then analyze fundamental performance limits via Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound and Fisher information matrix, explicitly quantifying how the analog combiner, array size, signal-to-noise ratio, and MS pose influence the pose information contained in the uplink observation. Building on these insights, we develop two methods for designing a low-complexity analog combiner. Numerical results show that the proposed predictive analog combining approach significantly improves tracking accuracy, even with fewer RF chains and lower transmit power.

Title: Near-Field Multi-User Communications via Polar-Domain Beamfocusing: Analytical Framework and Performance Analysis
Authors: Lin Chen, Ahmed Elzanaty, Mustafa A. Kishk, Ying-Jun Angela Zhang
Abstract: As wireless systems evolve toward higher frequencies and extremely large antenna arrays, near-field (NF) propagation becomes increasingly dominant. Unlike far-field (FF) communication, which relies on a planar-wavefront model and is limited to angular-domain beamsteering, NF propagation exhibits spherical wavefronts that enable beamfocusing in both angle and distance, i.e., the polar domain, offering new opportunities for spatial multiple access. This paper develops an analytical stochastic geometry (SG) framework for a multi-user system assisted by polar-domain beamfocusing, which jointly captures NF propagation characteristics and the spatial randomness of user locations. The intrinsic coupling between angle and distance in the NF antenna pattern renders inter-user interference analysis intractable. To address this challenge, we propose a tractable near-field multi-level antenna pattern (NF-MLAP) approximation, which enables computationally efficient expressions and tight upper bounds for key performance metrics, including coverage probability, spectrum efficiency, and area spectrum efficiency. Analytical and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework accurately captures performance trends and reveals fundamental trade-offs between hardware configuration (including the number of antennas and radio frequency chains) and system performance (in terms of spatial resource reuse and interference mitigation).

Title: OpenPathNet: An Open-Source RF Multipath Data Generator for AI-Driven Wireless Systems
Authors: Lizhou Liu, Xiaohui Chen, Wenyi Zhang
Abstract: The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and sixth-generation (6G) wireless technologies is driving an urgent need for large-scale, high-fidelity, and reproducible radio frequency (RF) datasets. Existing resources, such as CKMImageNet, primarily provide preprocessed and image-based channel representations, which conceal the fine-grained physical characteristics of signal propagation that are essential for effective AI modeling. To bridge this gap, we present OpenPathNet, an open-source RF multipath data generator accompanied by a publicly released dataset for AI-driven wireless research. Distinct from prior datasets, OpenPathNet offers disaggregated and physically consistent multipath parameters, including per-path gain, time of arrival (ToA), and spatial angles, derived from high-precision ray tracing simulations constructed on real-world environment maps. By adopting a modular, parameterized pipeline, OpenPathNet enables reproducible generation of multipath data and can be readily extended to new environments and configurations, improving scalability and transparency. The released generator and accompanying dataset provide an extensible testbed that holds promise for advancing studies on channel modeling, beam prediction, environment-aware communication, and integrated sensing in AI-enabled 6G systems. The source code and dataset are publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Content-Aware RSMA-Enabled Pinching-Antenna Systems for Latency Optimization in 6G Networks
Authors: Yu Hua, Yaru Fu, Yalin Liu, Zheng Shi, Kevin Hung
Abstract: The Pinching Antenna System (PAS) has emerged as a promising technology to dynamically reconfigure wireless propagation environments in 6G networks. By activating radiating elements at arbitrary positions along a dielectric waveguide, PAS can establish strong line-of-sight (LoS) links with users, significantly enhancing channel gain and deployment flexibility, particularly in high-frequency bands susceptible to severe path loss. To further improve multi-user performance, this paper introduces a novel content-aware transmission framework that integrates PAS with rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). Unlike conventional RSMA, the proposed RSMA scheme enables users requesting the same content to share a unified private stream, thereby mitigating inter-user interference and reducing power fragmentation. We formulate a joint optimization problem aimed at minimizing the average system latency by dynamically adapting both antenna positioning and RSMA parameters according to channel conditions and user requests. A Content-Aware RSMA and Pinching-antenna Joint Optimization (CARP-JO) algorithm is developed, which decomposes the non-convex problem into tractable subproblems solved via bisection search, convex programming, and golden-section search. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CARP-JO scheme consistently outperforms Traditional RSMA, NOMA, and Fixed-antenna systems across diverse network scenarios in terms of latency, underscoring the effectiveness of co-designing physical-layer reconfigurability with intelligent communication strategies.

Title: Active RIS-Aided Anti-Jamming Wireless Communications: A Stackelberg Game Perspective
Authors: Xiao Tang, Zhen Ma, Bin Li, Cong Li, Qinghe Du, Dusit Niyato, Zhu Han
Abstract: The pervasive threat of jamming attacks, particularly from adaptive jammers capable of optimizing their strategies, poses a significant challenge to the security and reliability of wireless communications. This paper addresses this issue by investigating anti-jamming communications empowered by an active reconfigurable intelligent surface. The strategic interaction between the legitimate system and the adaptive jammer is modeled as a Stackelberg game, where the legitimate user, acting as the leader, proactively designs its strategy while anticipating the jammer's optimal response. We prove the existence of the Stackelberg equilibrium and derive it using a backward induction method. Particularly, the jammer's optimal strategy is embedded into the leader's problem, resulting in a bi-level optimization that jointly considers legitimate transmit power, transmit/receive beamformers, and active reflection. We tackle this complex, non-convex problem by using a block coordinate descent framework, wherein subproblems are iteratively solved via convex relaxation and successive convex approximation techniques. Simulation results demonstrate the significant superiority of the proposed active RIS-assisted scheme in enhancing legitimate transmissions and degrading jamming effects compared to baseline schemes across various scenarios. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining active RIS technology with a strategic game-theoretic framework for anti-jamming communications.

Abstract: In multi-attribute decision-making problems where the attribute values are interval grey numbers, a simplified form based on kernels and the degree of greyness is presented. Combining fuzzy graph theory with the kernel and the degree of greyness of interval grey numbers, grey graphs and their corresponding operation rules are presented. This paper presents a new multi-attribute decision-making method based on grey graph theory. We analyzed and evaluated the alternative schemes using grey graph. Lastly, a numerical example was conducted in order to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method.

Title: SCAR: Semantic Cardiac Adversarial Representation via Spatiotemporal Manifold Optimization in ECG
Authors: Shunbo Jia, Caizhi Liao
Abstract: Deep learning models for Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis have achieved expert-level performance but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, applying Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAP) to ECG signals presents a unique challenge: standard imperceptible noise constraints (e.g., 10 uV) fail to generate effective universal attacks due to the high inter-subject variability of cardiac waveforms. Furthermore, traditional "invisible" attacks are easily dismissed by clinicians as technical artifacts, failing to compromise the human-in-the-loop diagnostic pipeline. In this study, we propose SCAR (Semantic Cardiac Adversarial Representation), a novel UAP framework tailored to bypass the clinical "Human Firewall." Unlike traditional approaches, SCAR integrates spatiotemporal smoothing (W=25, approx. 50ms), spectral consistency (<15 Hz), and anatomical amplitude constraints (<0.2 mV) directly into the gradient optimization manifold. Results: We benchmarked SCAR against a rigorous baseline (Standard Universal DeepFool with post-hoc physiological filtering). While the baseline suffers a performance collapse (~16% success rate on transfer tasks), SCAR maintains robust transferability (58.09% on ResNet) and achieves 82.46% success on the source model. Crucially, clinical analysis reveals an emergent targeted behavior: SCAR specifically converges to forging Myocardial Infarction features (90.2% misdiagnosis) by mathematically reconstructing pathological ST-segment elevations. Finally, we demonstrate that SCAR serves a dual purpose: it not only functions as a robust data augmentation strategy for Hybrid Adversarial Training, offering optimal clinical defense, but also provides effective educational samples for training clinicians to recognize low-cost, AI-targeted semantic forgeries.

Title: Sub-6 GHz Beam-Reconfigurable Microfluidic Antenna Using Graphene Liquid for 5G Network
Authors: Sasmita Dash, Constantinos Psomas, Ioannis Krikidis
Abstract: As wireless communication systems continue to grow rapidly, high-performance antennas become increasingly crucial for expanding coverage, improving capacity, and enhancing transmission quality. In light of this, research has focused considerable attention on liquid antennas due to their unique characteristics, which include small size, flexibility, reconfigurability and transparency. Recently, graphene liquid has been explored for numerous applications due to its low cost, high conductivity, flexibility, and ease of processing. Specifically for antenna applications, graphene liquid performs better than conventional liquid metal. This paper presents a graphene-liquid antenna with beam reconfiguration ability for sub-6 GHz communication system. The graphene-liquid movement within the microfluidic channel is taken into consideration by the reconfiguration mechanism. The antenna achieves beam reconfiguration in 360° directions with 6 dBi of gain at 5.5 GHz, featuring a wideband impedance bandwidth of 24%. The antenna main beam is specifically reconfigured into six directions (0°, 45°, 135°, 180°, 225° and 315°) at 5.5 GHz. Additionally, in all six reconfigurable scenarios at 5.5 GHz, the antenna provides a stable reflection coefficient. Therefore, for the next generation of wireless communication systems, this novel design of graphene-liquid-based reconfigurable sub-6 GHz antennas holds promise.

Title: Linear Attention for Joint Power Optimization and User-Centric Clustering in Cell-Free Networks
Authors: Irched Chafaa, Giacomo Bacci, Luca Sanguinetti
Abstract: Optimal AP clustering and power allocation are critical in user-centric cell-free massive MIMO systems. Existing deep learning models lack flexibility to handle dynamic network configurations. Furthermore, many approaches overlook pilot contamination and suffer from high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a lightweight transformer model that overcomes these limitations by jointly predicting AP clusters and powers solely from spatial coordinates of user devices and AP. Our model is architecture-agnostic to users load, handles both clustering and power allocation without channel estimation overhead, and eliminates pilot contamination by assigning users to AP within a pilot reuse constraint. We also incorporate a customized linear attention mechanism to capture user-AP interactions efficiently and enable linear scalability with respect to the number of users. Numerical results confirm the model's effectiveness in maximizing the minimum spectral efficiency and providing near-optimal performance while ensuring adaptability and scalability in dynamic scenarios.

Title: Fetpype: An Open-Source Pipeline for Reproducible Fetal Brain MRI Analysis
Authors: Thomas Sanchez, Gerard Martí-Juan, David Meunier, Miguel Angel Gonzalez Ballester, Oscar Camara, Gemma Piella, Meritxell Bach Cuadra, Guillaume Auzias
Abstract: Fetal brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is crucial for assessing neurodevelopment in utero. However, analyzing this data presents significant challenges due to fetal motion, low signal-to-noise ratio, and the need for complex multi-step processing, including motion correction, super-resolution reconstruction, segmentation, and surface extraction. While various specialized tools exist for individual steps, integrating them into robust, reproducible, and user-friendly workflows that go from raw images to processed volumes is not straightforward. This lack of standardization hinders reproducibility across studies and limits the adoption of advanced analysis techniques for researchers and clinicians. To address these challenges, we introduce Fetpype, an open-source Python library designed to streamline and standardize the preprocessing and analysis of T2-weighted fetal brain MRI data. Fetpype is publicly available on GitHub at this https URL.

Title: Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for Nonlinear Matrix Decompositions
Authors: Atharva Awari, Nicolas Gillis, Arnaud Vandaele
Abstract: We present an algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for solving nonlinear matrix decompositions (NMD). Given an input matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ and a factorization rank $r \ll \min(m, n)$, NMD seeks matrices $W \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times r}$ and $H \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times n}$ such that $X \approx f(WH)$, where $f$ is an element-wise nonlinear function. We evaluate our method on several representative nonlinear models: the rectified linear unit activation $f(x) = \max(0, x)$, suitable for nonnegative sparse data approximation, the component-wise square $f(x) = x^2$, applicable to probabilistic circuit representation, and the MinMax transform $f(x) = \min(b, \max(a, x))$, relevant for recommender systems. The proposed framework flexibly supports diverse loss functions, including least squares, $\ell_1$ norm, and the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and can be readily extended to other nonlinearities and metrics. We illustrate the applicability, efficiency, and adaptability of the approach on real-world datasets, highlighting its potential for a broad range of applications.

Title: Zero-Shot Recognition of Dysarthric Speech Using Commercial Automatic Speech Recognition and Multimodal Large Language Models
Authors: Ali Alsayegh, Tariq Masood
Abstract: Voice-based human-machine interaction is a primary modality for accessing intelligent systems, yet individuals with dysarthria face systematic exclusion due to recognition performance gaps. Whilst automatic speech recognition (ASR) achieves word error rates (WER) below 5% on typical speech, performance degrades dramatically for dysarthric speakers. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer potential for leveraging contextual reasoning to compensate for acoustic degradation, yet their zero-shot capabilities remain uncharacterised. This study evaluates eight commercial speech-to-text services on the TORGO dysarthric speech corpus: four conventional ASR systems (AssemblyAI, Whisper large-v3, Deepgram Nova-3, Nova-3 Medical) and four MLLM-based systems (GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash). Evaluation encompasses lexical accuracy, semantic preservation, and cost-latency trade-offs. Results demonstrate severity-dependent degradation: mild dysarthria achieves 3-5% WER approaching typical-speech benchmarks, whilst severe dysarthria exceeds 49% WER across all systems. A verbatim-transcription prompt yields architecture-specific effects: GPT-4o achieves 7.36 percentage point WER reduction with consistent improvement across all tested speakers, whilst Gemini variants exhibit degradation. Semantic metrics indicate that communicative intent remains partially recoverable despite elevated lexical error rates. These findings establish empirical baselines enabling evidence-based technology selection for assistive voice interface deployment.

Title: UPMRI: Unsupervised Parallel MRI Reconstruction via Projected Conditional Flow Matching
Authors: Xinzhe Luo, Yingzhen Li, Chen Qin
Abstract: Reconstructing high-quality images from substantially undersampled k-space data for accelerated MRI presents a challenging ill-posed inverse problem. While supervised deep learning has revolutionized this field, it relies heavily on large datasets of fully sampled ground-truth images, which are often impractical or impossible to acquire in clinical settings due to long scan times. Despite advances in self-supervised/unsupervised MRI reconstruction, their performance remains inadequate at high acceleration rates. To bridge this gap, we introduce UPMRI, an unsupervised reconstruction framework based on Projected Conditional Flow Matching (PCFM) and its unsupervised transformation. Unlike standard generative models, PCFM learns the prior distribution of fully sampled parallel MRI data by utilizing only undersampled k-space measurements. To reconstruct the image, we establish a novel theoretical link between the marginal vector field in the measurement space, governed by the continuity equation, and the optimal solution to the PCFM objective. This connection results in a cyclic dual-space sampling algorithm for high-quality reconstruction. Extensive evaluations on the fastMRI brain and CMRxRecon cardiac datasets demonstrate that UPMRI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised and unsupervised baselines. Notably, it also achieves reconstruction fidelity comparable to or better than leading supervised methods at high acceleration factors, while requiring no fully sampled training data.

Title: Resource-efficient medical image classification for edge devices
Authors: Mahsa Lavaei, Zahra Abadi, Salar Beigzad, Alireza Maleki
Abstract: Medical image classification is a critical task in healthcare, enabling accurate and timely diagnosis. However, deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained edge devices presents significant challenges due to computational and memory limitations. This research investigates a resource-efficient approach to medical image classification by employing model quantization techniques. Quantization reduces the precision of model parameters and activations, significantly lowering computational overhead and memory requirements without sacrificing classification accuracy. The study focuses on the optimization of quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ) methods tailored for edge devices, analyzing their impact on model performance across medical imaging datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that quantized models achieve substantial reductions in model size and inference latency, enabling real-time processing on edge hardware while maintaining clinically acceptable diagnostic accuracy. This work provides a practical pathway for deploying AI-driven medical diagnostics in remote and resource-limited settings, enhancing the accessibility and scalability of healthcare technologies.

Title: Dispatch-Aware Learning for Optimal Transmission Switching
Authors: Minsoo Kim, Andy Sun, Jip Kim
Abstract: Optimal transmission switching (OTS) improves optimal power flow (OPF) by selectively opening transmission lines, but its mixed-integer formulation increases computational complexity, especially on large grids. To deal with this, we propose a dispatch-aware deep neural network (DA-DNN) that accelerates DC-OTS without relying on pre-solved labels. DA-DNN predicts line states and passes them through an embedded differentiable DC-OPF layer, using the resulting generation cost as the loss function so that all physical network constraints are enforced throughout training and inference. In addition, we adopt a customized weight-bias initialization that keeps every forward pass feasible from the first iteration, which allows stable learning. Once trained, the proposed DA-DNN successfully produces a feasible topology and dispatch pair in the same time as solving the DCOPF, whereas conventional mixed-integer solvers become intractable. Moreover, the embedded OPF layer enables DA-DNN to generalize to untrained system configurations, such as changes in line flow limits. As a result, the proposed method successfully captures the economic advantages of OTS while maintaining scalability and generalization ability.

Title: Layer-to-layer Closed-loop Switched Heating and Cooling Control of the Laser Powder Bed Fusion Process
Authors: Barış Kavas, Efe C. Balta, Lars Witte, Michael R. Tucker, John Lygeros, Markus Bambach
Abstract: This study investigates the stabilization of interlayer temperature in the laser powder bed fusion process through a novel switched layer-to-layer closed-loop feedback controller. The controller architecture aims to measure the interlayer temperature by a laterally positioned thermal camera and maintain a preset reference temperature by switching between the heating mode through dynamic laser power adjustment and the cooling mode by assigning interlayer dwell time to allow cooling between layers. The switching controller employs a feedback optimization control algorithm for the heating mode to adjust the laser power, and a triggering algorithm that increases the interlayer dwell time until the interlayer temperature reaches the reference value. Additionally, the study compares the performance of the proposed controller in both supported and unsupported overhanging parts to evaluate the effect of support structures on the controller performance as well as the thermal behavior of overhanging parts. Results demonstrate the controller's effectiveness in stabilizing interlayer temperature across varying cross-sectional areas while remaining within the material's stable processing zone. In the heating mode, the controller efficiently stabilizes temperature, even in geometries with significant cross-section variation. The study also identifies trade-offs among process efficiency, energy consumption, and build time. Supported parts exhibit reduced overheating but consume more energy and material, while unsupported parts stabilize interlayer temperature faster but with longer build times due to increased dwell time assignments. The research highlights notable improvements in interlayer temperature control for geometries prone to excessive thermal stresses. Moreover, the introduction of interlayer dwell time offers a practical solution to maintaining thermal stability in complex geometries.

Title: SkinGenBench: Generative Model and Preprocessing Effects for Synthetic Dermoscopic Augmentation in Melanoma Diagnosis
Authors: N. A. Adarsh Pritam, Jeba Shiney O, Sanyam Jain
Abstract: This work introduces SkinGenBench, a systematic biomedical imaging benchmark that investigates how preprocessing complexity interacts with generative model choice for synthetic dermoscopic image augmentation and downstream melanoma diagnosis. Using a curated dataset of 14,116 dermoscopic images from HAM10000 and MILK10K across five lesion classes, we evaluate the two representative generative paradigms: StyleGAN2-ADA and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) under basic geometric augmentation and advanced artifact removal pipelines. Synthetic melanoma images are assessed using established perceptual and distributional metrics (FID, KID, IS), feature space analysis, and their impact on diagnostic performance across five downstream classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate that generative architecture choice has a stronger influence on both image fidelity and diagnostic utility than preprocessing complexity. StyleGAN2-ADA consistently produced synthetic images more closely aligned with real data distributions, achieving the lowest FID (~65.5) and KID (~0.05), while diffusion models generated higher variance samples at the cost of reduces perceptual fidelity and class anchoring. Advanced artifact removal yielded only marginal improvements in generative metrics and provided limited downstream diagnostic gains, suggesting possible suppression of clinically relevant texture cues. In contrast, synthetic data augmentation substantially improved melanoma detection with 8-15% absolute gains in melanoma F1-score, and ViT-B/16 achieving F1~0.88 and ROC-AUC~0.98, representing an improvement of approximately 14% over non-augmented baselines.

Title: UAV-Enabled ISAC: Towards On-Demand Sensing Services and Enhanced Communication
Authors: Xiaopeng Yuan, Peng Wu, Xinran Wang, Yulin Hu, Anke Schmeink
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an integrated sensing-and-communication (ISAC) network enabled by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The UAV is supposed to fly along a periodical circular trajectory at a fixed height for ISAC service supply from the sky. We consider on-demand sensing services, where on-demand detection and on-demand localization requests may be activated at any time toward any position within the targeted serving region. While guaranteeing satisfactory accuracy for both on-demand sensing tasks, we aim at maximizing the minimum achievable throughput among all communication users, via joint optimizing the UAV trajectory and communication user scheduling. To address the complicated problem with infinite sensing constraints, we characterize the on-demand detection constraint as a restricted deployment area for UAV and the on-demand localization constraint as Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) constraints over finite reference target points, based on which the original problem is simplified to more tractable one. Afterwards, particularly aiming to ensure no violations of CRB constraints, we propose a convex approximation for the reformulated problem, where tight approximation is guaranteed at given local solution. The construction strategy for convex problem approximation allows an efficient iterative algorithm with verified convergence to a superior suboptimal solution. At last, with simulations, we verified the applicability of our developed optimization scheme in strictly fulfilling the on-demand sensing constraints and the effectiveness of our proposed solution for simultaneously enhancing the communication throughput in UAV-enabled ISAC.

Title: Augmented Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing for Both Low PAPR Signaling and Diversity Gain Protection
Authors: Zhou Lu, Mohammed El-Hajjar, Lie-liang Yang
Abstract: Research results on Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM) reveal that it experiences the same Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) problem as conventional Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM). On the other side, some references and also our studies demonstrate that AFDM involves an unneeded matrix, which is based on a parameter typically represented by $c_2$, for signalling. Hence, in this paper, an augmented AFDM scheme, referred to as A$^2$FDM, is proposed to mitigate the PAPR problem of AFDM, which is achieved by replacing the $c_2$ matrix in AFDM by a new unitary matrix that performs both sub-block-based Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and symbol mapping. Two symbol mapping schemes, namely interleaved mapping and localized mapping, are proposed for implementing A$^2$FDM, yielding the Interleaved A$^2$FDM and Localized A$^2$FDM. The input-output relationships of these schemes are derived and the complexity and the effects of system parameters on the performance of A$^2$FDM along with AFDM systems are analyzed. Furthermore, simulation results are provided to demonstrate and compare comprehensively the performance of the considered schemes in conjunction with different system settings and various operational conditions. Our studies and results demonstrate that, while A$^2$FDM is capable of circumventing the PAPR problem faced by AFDM, it is capable of attaining the achievable diversity gain, when AFDM is operated in its undesirable conditions resulting in the loss of the diversity gain available.

Title: Breast Cancer Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Treatment Response Prediction Using Aligned Longitudinal MRI and Clinical Data
Authors: Rahul Ravi, Ruizhe Li, Tarek Abdelfatah, Stephen Chan, Xin Chen
Abstract: Aim: This study investigates treatment response prediction to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in breast cancer patients, using longitudinal contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images (CE-MRI) and clinical data. The goal is to develop machine learning (ML) models to predict pathologic complete response (PCR binary classification) and 5-year relapse-free survival status (RFS binary classification). Method: The proposed framework includes tumour segmentation, image registration, feature extraction, and predictive modelling. Using the image registration method, MRI image features can be extracted and compared from the original tumour site at different time points, therefore monitoring the intratumor changes during NACT process. Four feature extractors, including one radiomics and three deep learning-based (MedicalNet, Segformer3D, SAM-Med3D) were implemented and compared. In combination with three feature selection methods and four ML models, predictive models are built and compared. Results: The proposed image registration-based feature extraction consistently improves the predictive models. In the PCR and RFS classification tasks logistic regression model trained on radiomic features performed the best with an AUC of 0.88 and classification accuracy of 0.85 for PCR classification, and AUC of 0.78 and classification accuracy of 0.72 for RFS classification. Conclusions: It is evidenced that the image registration method has significantly improved performance in longitudinal feature learning in predicting PCR and RFS. The radiomics feature extractor is more effective than the pre-trained deep learning feature extractors, with higher performance and better interpretability.

Title: MedNeXt-v2: Scaling 3D ConvNeXts for Large-Scale Supervised Representation Learning in Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Saikat Roy, Yannick Kirchhoff, Constantin Ulrich, Maximillian Rokuss, Tassilo Wald, Fabian Isensee, Klaus Maier-Hein
Abstract: Large-scale supervised pretraining is rapidly reshaping 3D medical image segmentation. However, existing efforts focus primarily on increasing dataset size and overlook the question of whether the backbone network is an effective representation learner at scale. In this work, we address this gap by revisiting ConvNeXt-based architectures for volumetric segmentation and introducing MedNeXt-v2, a compound-scaled 3D ConvNeXt that leverages improved micro-architecture and data scaling to deliver state-of-the-art performance. First, we show that routinely used backbones in large-scale pretraining pipelines are often suboptimal. Subsequently, we use comprehensive backbone benchmarking prior to scaling and demonstrate that stronger from scratch performance reliably predicts stronger downstream performance after pretraining. Guided by these findings, we incorporate a 3D Global Response Normalization module and use depth, width, and context scaling to improve our architecture for effective representation learning. We pretrain MedNeXt-v2 on 18k CT volumes and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance when fine-tuning across six challenging CT and MR benchmarks (144 structures), showing consistent gains over seven publicly released pretrained models. Beyond improvements, our benchmarking of these models also reveals that stronger backbones yield better results on similar data, representation scaling disproportionately benefits pathological segmentation, and that modality-specific pretraining offers negligible benefit once full finetuning is applied. In conclusion, our results establish MedNeXt-v2 as a strong backbone for large-scale supervised representation learning in 3D Medical Image Segmentation.

Title: Techno-Economic Case Study of a Rural Local Electricity Community in Switzerland
Authors: Gerard Marias Gonzalez, Alejandro Pena-Bello, Jérémy Dumoulin, Nicolas Wyrsch
Abstract: Local Electricity Communities (communautés électriques locales, CEL) will become operational in Switzerland in 2026, allowing prosumers, consumers, and storage operators within the same municipality and distribution system operator (DSO) area to exchange electricity over the public grid with reduced distribution tariffs. This report examines a rural Swiss case study to explore the techno-economic implications of CELs for both participants and the local DSO. The findings indicate that CELs can enhance the local use of renewable generation, particularly photovoltaics, and offer modest financial gains, with outcomes strongly shaped by community size, composition, and tariff design. Larger and more heterogeneous communities achieve better internal matching of supply and demand, though the overall incentive remains limited because the tariff reduction applies only to distribution charges. The study further shows that internal energy exchange is maximized when local PV generation covers roughly 1-2 times the community load. For DSOs, CELs reduce grid imports (27-46%), resulting in a substantial reduction in distribution tariff revenues (17-36%), necessitating regulatory adaptation. While centralized batteries provide economic value to members, their technical impact on the grid remains modest due to their small, economically optimized capacity. Larger centralized storage is shown to reduce transformer peak power, but risks increasing line loading, suggesting a need for careful sizing and placement.

Title: Bridging simulation and reality in subsurface radar-based sensing: physics-guided hierarchical domain adaptation with deep adversarial learning
Authors: Zixin Wang, Ishfaq Aziz, Mohamad Alipour
Abstract: Accurate estimation of subsurface material properties, such as soil moisture, is critical for wildfire risk assessment and precision agriculture. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is a non-destructive geophysical technique widely used to characterize subsurface conditions. Data-driven parameter estimation methods typically require large amounts of labeled training data, which is expensive to obtain from real-world GPR scans under diverse subsurface conditions. A physics-based GPR model using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method can be employed to generate large synthetic datasets through simulations across varying material parameters, which are then utilized to train data-driven models. A key limitation, however, is that simulated data (source domain) and real-world data (target domain) often follow different distributions, which can cause data-driven models trained on simulations to underperform in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel physics-guided hierarchical domain adaptation framework with deep adversarial learning for robust subsurface material property estimation from GPR signals. The proposed framework is systematically evaluated through the laboratory tests for single- and two-layer materials, as well as the field tests for single- and two-layer materials, and is benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods, including the one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) and domain adversarial neural network (DANN). The results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves higher correlation coefficients R and lower Bias between the predicted and measured parameter values, along with smaller standard deviations in the estimations, thereby validating their effectiveness in bridging the domain gap between simulated and real-world radar signals and enabling efficient subsurface material property retrieval.

Title: Novel Double-Chirp Preamble Design for Multiuser Asynchronous Massive MIMO LoRa Networks
Authors: The Khai Nguyen, Ebrahim Bedeer
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel preamble design and detection method for multiuser asynchronous massive MIMO LoRa networks. Unlike existing works, which only consider the preamble detection for a single target end devices (ED), we proposed to simultaneously detect the preambles of multiple EDs that asynchronously transmit their uplink (UL) packets to a multiple-antenna gateway (GW). First we show that the preamble detection in multiuser LoRa networks with the conventional single-chirp preamble suffers from the so-called preamble resemblance effect. This means that the preamble of any single ED can resemble the preambles of all EDs in the network, and make it impossible to determine to which ED a preamble belongs. To address this problem, a novel double-chirp preamble design and a preamble assignment method are proposed, which can mitigate the preamble resemblance effect by making the preamble of each ED unique and recognizable. Next, a maximum-likelihood (ML) based detection scheme for the proposed double-chirp preamble is derived. Finally, since the proposed algorithm requires the calculation of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) every sampling period, we proposed a low-complexity technique to calculate the DFT recursively to reduce the complexity of our proposed design. Simulation shows that the proposed preamble detection design and detection requires just about 2 dB more power to increase the number of EDs from one to 15 in the Rayleigh fading channel while achieving the same preamble detection error performance.

Title: Distributionally Robust Imitation Learning: Layered Control Architecture for Certifiable Autonomy
Authors: Aditya Gahlawat, Ahmed Aboudonia, Sandeep Banik, Naira Hovakimyan, Nikolai Matni, Aaron D. Ames, Gioele Zardini, Alberto Speranzon
Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) enables autonomous behavior by learning from expert demonstrations. While more sample-efficient than comparative alternatives like reinforcement learning, IL is sensitive to compounding errors induced by distribution shifts. There are two significant sources of distribution shifts when using IL-based feedback laws on systems: distribution shifts caused by policy error and distribution shifts due to exogenous disturbances and endogenous model errors due to lack of learning. Our previously developed approaches, Taylor Series Imitation Learning (TaSIL) and $\mathcal{L}_1$ -Distributionally Robust Adaptive Control (\ellonedrac), address the challenge of distribution shifts in complementary ways. While TaSIL offers robustness against policy error-induced distribution shifts, \ellonedrac offers robustness against distribution shifts due to aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. To enable certifiable IL for learned and/or uncertain dynamical systems, we formulate \textit{Distributionally Robust Imitation Policy (DRIP)} architecture, a Layered Control Architecture (LCA) that integrates TaSIL and~\ellonedrac. By judiciously designing individual layer-centric input and output requirements, we show how we can guarantee certificates for the entire control pipeline. Our solution paves the path for designing fully certifiable autonomy pipelines, by integrating learning-based components, such as perception, with certifiable model-based decision-making through the proposed LCA approach.

Title: BIONIX: A Wireless, Low-Cost Prosthetic Arm with Dual-Signal EEG and EMG Control
Authors: Pranesh Sathish Kumar
Abstract: Affordable upper-limb prostheses often lack intuitive control systems, limiting functionality and accessibility for amputees in low-resource settings. This project presents a low-cost, dual-mode neuro-muscular control system integrating electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) to enable real-time, multi-degree-of-freedom control of a prosthetic arm. EEG signals are acquired using the NeuroSky MindWave Mobile 2 and transmitted via ThinkGear Bluetooth packets to an ESP32 microcontroller running a lightweight classification model. The model was trained on 1500 seconds of recorded EEG data using a 6-frame sliding window with low-pass filtering, excluding poor-signal samples and using a 70/20/10 training--validation--test split. The classifier detects strong blink events, which toggle the hand between open and closed states. EMG signals are acquired using a MyoWare 2.0 sensor and SparkFun wireless shield and transmitted to a second ESP32, which performs threshold-based detection. Three activation bands (rest: 0--T1; extension: T1--T2; contraction: greater than T2) enable intuitive elbow control, with movement triggered only after eight consecutive frames in a movement class to improve stability. The EEG-controlled ESP32 actuates four finger servos, while the EMG-controlled ESP32 drives two elbow servos. A functional prototype was constructed using low-cost materials (total cost approximately 240 dollars), with most expense attributed to the commercial EEG headset. Future work includes transitioning to a 3D-printed chassis, integrating auto-regressive models to reduce EMG latency, and upgrading servo torque for improved load capacity and grip strength. This system demonstrates a feasible pathway to low-cost, biologically intuitive prosthetic control suitable for underserved and global health applications.

Title: Security Risks of Agentic Vehicles: A Systematic Analysis of Cognitive and Cross-Layer Threats
Authors: Ali Eslami, Jiangbo Yu
Abstract: Agentic AI is increasingly being explored and introduced in both manually driven and autonomous vehicles, leading to the notion of Agentic Vehicles (AgVs), with capabilities such as memory-based personalization, goal interpretation, strategic reasoning, and tool-mediated assistance. While frameworks such as the OWASP Agentic AI Security Risks highlight vulnerabilities in reasoning-driven AI systems, they are not designed for safety-critical cyber-physical platforms such as vehicles, nor do they account for interactions with other layers such as perception, communication, and control layers. This paper investigates security threats in AgVs, including OWASP-style risks and cyber-attacks from other layers affecting the agentic layer. By introducing a role-based architecture for agentic vehicles, consisting of a Personal Agent and a Driving Strategy Agent, we will investigate vulnerabilities in both agentic AI layer and cross-layer risks, including risks originating from upstream layers (e.g., perception layer, control layer, etc.). A severity matrix and attack-chain analysis illustrate how small distortions can escalate into misaligned or unsafe behavior in both human-driven and autonomous vehicles. The resulting framework provides the first structured foundation for analyzing security risks of agentic AI in both current and emerging vehicle platforms.

Title: Fault Diagnosis and Quantification for Photovoltaic Arrays based on Differentiable Physical Models
Authors: Zenan Yang, Yuanliang Li, Jingwei Zhang, Yongjie Liu, Kun Ding
Abstract: Accurate fault diagnosis and quantification are essential for the reliable operation and intelligent maintenance of photovoltaic (PV) arrays. However, existing fault quantification methods often suffer from limited efficiency and interpretability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel fault quantification approach for PV strings based on a differentiable fast fault simulation model (DFFSM). The proposed DFFSM accurately models I-V characteristics under multiple faults and provides analytical gradients with respect to fault parameters. Leveraging this property, a gradient-based fault parameters identification (GFPI) method using the Adahessian optimizer is developed to efficiently quantify partial shading, short-circuit, and series-resistance degradation. Experimental results on both simulated and measured I-V curves demonstrate that the proposed GFPI achieves high quantification accuracy across different faults, with the I-V reconstruction error below 3%, confirming the feasibility and effectiveness of the application of differentiable physical simulators for PV system fault diagnosis.

Title: Do Foundational Audio Encoders Understand Music Structure?
Authors: Keisuke Toyama, Zhi Zhong, Akira Takahashi, Shusuke Takahashi, Yuki Mitsufuji
Abstract: In music information retrieval (MIR) research, the use of pretrained foundational audio encoders (FAEs) has recently become a trend. FAEs pretrained on large amounts of music and audio data have been shown to improve performance on MIR tasks such as music tagging and automatic music transcription. However, their use for music structure analysis (MSA) remains underexplored. Although many open-source FAE models are available, only a small subset has been examined for MSA, and the impact of factors such as learning methods, training data, and model context length on MSA performance remains unclear. In this study, we conduct comprehensive experiments on 11 types of FAEs to investigate how these factors affect MSA performance. Our results demonstrate that FAEs using selfsupervised learning with masked language modeling on music data are particularly effective for MSA. These findings pave the way for future research in MSA.

Authors: Sourav Banerjee, Neel Kanth Kundu
Abstract: Rydberg atom-based RF sensors offer distinct advantages over conventional dipole antennas for electric field detection. This paper presents a system model and performance analysis of a Rydberg atom-based quantum radar, which employs optical readout via lasers and photon detectors instead of circuit-based receivers. We derive the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), compare it with classical radar, and estimate Doppler frequency using an invariant function-based method. Simulations show that the quantum radar achieves higher SNR and lower RMSE in velocity estimation than conventional radar.

Title: When De-noising Hurts: A Systematic Study of Speech Enhancement Effects on Modern Medical ASR Systems

Abstract: Speech enhancement methods are commonly believed to improve the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) in noisy environments. However, the effectiveness of these techniques cannot be taken for granted in the case of modern large-scale ASR models trained on diverse, noisy data. We present a systematic evaluation of MetricGAN-plus-voicebank denoising on four state-of-the-art ASR systems: OpenAI Whisper, NVIDIA Parakeet, Google Gemini Flash 2.0, Parrotlet-a using 500 medical speech recordings under nine noise conditions. ASR performance is measured using semantic WER (semWER), a normalized word error rate (WER) metric accounting for domain-specific normalizations. Our results reveal a counterintuitive finding: speech enhancement preprocessing degrades ASR performance across all noise conditions and models. Original noisy audio achieves lower semWER than enhanced audio in all 40 tested configurations (4 models x 10 conditions), with degradations ranging from 1.1% to 46.6% absolute semWER increase. These findings suggest that modern ASR models possess sufficient internal noise robustness and that traditional speech enhancement may remove acoustic features critical for ASR. For practitioners deploying medical scribe systems in noisy clinical environments, our results indicate that preprocessing audio with noise reduction techniques might not just be computationally wasteful but also be potentially harmful to the transcription accuracy.

Title: A 14ns-Latency 9Gb/s 0.44mm$^2$ 62pJ/b Short-Blocklength LDPC Decoder ASIC in 22FDX
Authors: Darja Nonaca, Jérémy Guichemerre, Reinhard Wiesmayr, Nihat Engin Tunali, Christoph Studer
Abstract: Ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) is a key part of 5G wireless systems. Achieving low latency necessitates codes with short blocklengths for which polar codes with successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding typically outperform message-passing (MP)-based decoding of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. However, SCL decoders are known to exhibit high latency and poor area efficiency. In this paper, we propose a new short-blocklength multi-rate binary LDPC code that outperforms the 5G-LDPC code for the same blocklength and is suitable for URLLC applications using fully parallel MP. To demonstrate our code's efficacy, we present a 0.44mm$^2$ GlobalFoundries 22FDX LDPC decoder ASIC which supports three rates and achieves the lowest-in-class decoding latency of 14ns while reaching an information throughput of 9Gb/s at 62pJ/b energy efficiency for a rate-1/2 code with 128-bit blocklength.

Title: NeuRehab: A Reinforcement Learning and Spiking Neural Network-Based Rehab Automation Framework
Authors: Phani Pavan Kambhampati (1), Chainesh Gautam (1), Jagan Palaniswamy (1), Madhav Rao (1) ((1) IIIT Bangalore)
Abstract: Recent advancements in robotic rehabilitation therapy have provided modular exercise systems for post-stroke muscle recovery with basic control schemes. But these systems struggle to adapt to patients' complex and ever-changing behaviour, and to operate within mobile settings, such as heat and power. To aid this, we present NeuRehab: an end-to-end framework consisting of a training and inference pipeline with AI-based automation, co-designed with neuromorphic computing-based control systems that balance action performance, power consumption, and observed latency. The framework consists of 2 partitions. One is designated for the rehabilitation device based on ultra-low power spiking networks deployed on dedicated neuromorphic hardware. The other resides on stationary hardware that can accommodate computationally intensive hardware for fine-tuning on a per-patient basis. By maintaining a communication channel between both the modules and splitting the algorithm components, the power and latency requirements of the movable system have been optimised, while retaining the learning performance advantages of compute- and power-hungry hardware on the stationary machine. As part of the framework, we propose (a) the split machine learning processes for efficiency in architectural utilisation, and (b) task-specific temporal optimisations to lower edge-inference control latency. This paper evaluates the proposed methods on a reference stepper motor-based shoulder exercise. Overall, these methods offer comparable performance uplifts over the State-of-the-art for neuromorphic deployment, while achieving over 60% savings in both power and latency during inference compared to standard implementations.

Title: Spectro-temporal unitary transformations for coherent modulation: design trade-offs and practical considerations
Authors: Callum Deakin, Xi Chen
Abstract: This paper analyzes the performance of spectro-temporal unitary transforms for coherent optical modulation. Unlike conventional IQ modulation, such transforms are based on a cascade of phase modulators and dispersive elements, so are theoretically lossless and not limited by the bandwidth of the constituent modulators. We analyse the performance limits and design trade-offs of this scheme: estimating how the number of stages, amount of dispersion, modulator bandwidth, symbol block length and electrical signal power impacts the achievable signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR). Importantly, we show that high (>30 dB) SDRs suitable for modern >200 GBd class coherent optical communications are achievable with a low (<6) number of stages and reasonable parameters for driver power, modulator bandwidth and on-chip dispersion. Finally we address the SDR penalties associated with potential phase, amplitude, or dispersion errors, and limited DAC resolution.

Title: Nonlinear moving horizon estimation for robust state and parameter estimation -- extended version
Authors: Julian D. Schiller, Matthias A. Müller
Abstract: We propose a moving horizon estimation scheme to estimate the states and the unknown constant parameters of general nonlinear uncertain discrete-time systems. The proposed framework and analysis explicitly do not involve the a priori verification of a particular excitation condition for the parameters. Instead, we use online information about the actual excitation of the parameters at any time during operation and ensure that the regularization term in the cost function is always automatically selected appropriately. This ensures that the state and parameter estimation error is bounded for all times, even if the parameters are never (or only rarely) excited during operation. Robust exponential stability of the state and parameter estimation error emerges under an additional uniform condition on the maximum duration of insufficient excitation. The theoretical results are illustrated by a numerical example.

Title: MSDiff: Multi-Scale Diffusion Model for Ultra-Sparse View CT Reconstruction
Authors: Junyan Zhang, Mengxiao Geng, Pinhuang Tan, Yi Liu, Zhili Liu, Bin Huang, Qiegen Liu
Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) technology reduces radiation haz-ards to the human body through sparse sampling, but fewer sampling angles pose challenges for image reconstruction. Score-based generative models are widely used in sparse-view CT re-construction, performance diminishes significantly with a sharp reduction in projection angles. Therefore, we propose an ultra-sparse view CT reconstruction method utilizing multi-scale dif-fusion models (MSDiff), designed to concentrate on the global distribution of information and facilitate the reconstruction of sparse views with local image characteristics. Specifically, the proposed model ingeniously integrates information from both comprehensive sampling and selectively sparse sampling tech-niques. Through precise adjustments in diffusion model, it is capable of extracting diverse noise distribution, furthering the understanding of the overall structure of images, and aiding the fully sampled model in recovering image information more effec-tively. By leveraging the inherent correlations within the projec-tion data, we have designed an equidistant mask, enabling the model to focus its attention more effectively. Experimental re-sults demonstrated that the multi-scale model approach signifi-cantly improved the quality of image reconstruction under ultra-sparse angles, with good generalization across various datasets.

Title: Quantifying the Dunkelflaute -- An analysis of variable renewable energy droughts in Europe
Authors: Martin Kittel, Wolf-Peter Schill
Abstract: Variable renewable energy droughts, also called "Dunkelflaute", emerge as a challenge for climate-neutral energy systems based on variable renewables. Here we characterize European drought events for on- and offshore wind power, solar photovoltaics, and renewable technology portfolios, using 38 historic weather years and an advanced identification method. Their characteristics heavily depend on the chosen drought threshold, questioning the usefulness of single-threshold analyses. Applying a multi-threshold framework, we quantify how the complementarity of wind and solar power temporally and spatially alleviates drought frequency, return periods, duration, and severity within (portfolio effect) and across countries (balancing effect). We identify the most extreme droughts, which drive major discharging periods of long-duration storage in a fully renewable European energy system, based on a policy-relevant decarbonization scenario. Such events comprise sequences of shorter droughts of varying severity. The most extreme event occurred in winter 1996/97 and lasted 55 days in an idealized, perfectly interconnected setting. The average renewable availability during this period was still 47% of its long-run mean. System planners must consider such events when planning for storage and other flexibility technologies. Methodologically, we conclude that using arbitrary single calendar years is not suitable for modeling weather-resilient energy scenarios.

Title: Dynamic PET Image Prediction Using a Network Combining Reversible and Irreversible Modules
Authors: Jie Sun, Junyan Zhang, Qian Xia, Chuanfu Sun, Yumei Chen, Yunjie Yang, Huafeng Liu, Wentao Zhu, Qiegen Liu
Abstract: Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) images can reveal the distribution of tracers in the organism and the dynamic processes involved in biochemical reactions, and it is widely used in clinical practice. Despite the high effectiveness of dynamic PET imaging in studying the kinetics and metabolic processes of radiotracers. Pro-longed scan times can cause discomfort for both patients and medical personnel. This study proposes a dynamic frame prediction method for dynamic PET imaging, reduc-ing dynamic PET scanning time by applying a multi-module deep learning framework composed of reversible and irreversible modules. The network can predict kinetic parameter images based on the early frames of dynamic PET images, and then generate complete dynamic PET images.

Title: Joint Coverage and Electromagnetic Field Exposure Analysis in Downlink and Uplink for RIS-assisted Networks
Authors: Lin Chen, Ahmed Elzanaty, Mustafa A Kishk, Ying-Jun Angela Zhang
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have shown the potential to improve signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) related coverage, especially at high-frequency communications. However, assessing electromagnetic field exposure (EMFE) and establishing EMFE regulations in RIS-assisted large-scale networks remain open issues. This paper proposes a stochastic geometry (SG) based framework to characterize SINR and EMFE in such networks for downlink and uplink scenarios. Particularly, we carefully consider the association rule with the presence of RISs, accurate antenna pattern at base stations (BSs), fading model, and power control mechanism at mobile devices in the system model. Under the proposed framework, we derive the marginal and joint distributions of SINR and EMFE in downlink and uplink, respectively. The first moment of EMFE is also provided. Additionally, we design the compliance distance (CD) between a BS/RIS and a user to comply with the EMFE regulations. To facilitate efficient identification, we further provide approximate closed-form expressions for CDs. From numerical results of the marginal distributions, we find that in the downlink scenario, deploying RISs may not always be beneficial, as the improved SINR comes at the cost of increased EMFE. However, in the uplink scenario, RIS deployment is promising to enhance coverage while still maintaining EMFE compliance. By simultaneously evaluating coverage and compliance metrics through joint distributions, we demonstrate the feasibility of RISs in improving uplink and downlink performance. Insights from this framework can contribute to establishing EMFE guidelines and achieving a balance between coverage and compliance when deploying RISs.

Title: Towards a Single ASR Model That Generalizes to Disordered Speech
Authors: Jimmy Tobin, Katrin Tomanek, Subhashini Venugopalan
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of integrating a dataset of disordered speech recordings ($\sim$1,000 hours) into the fine-tuning of a near state-of-the-art ASR baseline system. Contrary to what one might expect, despite the data being less than 1% of the training data of the ASR system, we find a considerable improvement in disordered speech recognition accuracy. Specifically, we observe a 33% improvement on prompted speech, and a 26% improvement on a newly gathered spontaneous, conversational dataset of disordered speech. Importantly, there is no significant performance decline on standard speech recognition benchmarks. Further, we observe that the proposed tuning strategy helps close the gap between the baseline system and personalized models by 64% highlighting the significant progress as well as the room for improvement. Given the substantial benefits of our findings, this experiment suggests that from a fairness perspective, incorporating a small fraction of high quality disordered speech data in a training recipe is an easy step that could be done to make speech technology more accessible for users with speech disabilities.

Title: Saturation-Aware Snapshot Compressive Imaging: Theory and Algorithm
Authors: Mengyu Zhao, Shirin Jalali
Abstract: Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) uses coded masks to compress a 3D data cube into a single 2D snapshot. In practice, multiplexing can push intensities beyond the sensor's dynamic range, producing saturation that violates the linear SCI model and degrades reconstruction. This paper provides the first theoretical characterization of SCI recovery under saturation. We model clipping as an element-wise nonlinearity and derive a finite-sample recovery bound for compression-based SCI that links reconstruction error to mask density and the extent of saturation. The analysis yields a clear design rule: optimal Bernoulli masks use densities below one-half, decreasing further as saturation strengthens. Guided by this principle, we optimize mask patterns and introduce a novel reconstruction framework, Saturation-Aware PnP Net (SAPnet), which explicitly enforces consistency with saturated measurements. Experiments on standard video-SCI benchmarks confirm our theory and demonstrate that SAPnet significantly outperforms existing PnP-based methods.

Title: Reduced-order asymptotic observer of nonlinear friction for precise motion control
Authors: Michael Ruderman
Abstract: Nonlinear friction has long been, and continues to be, one of the major challenges for precision motion control systems. A linear asymptotic observer of the motion state variables with nonlinear friction uses a dedicated state-space representation of the dynamic friction force (including pre-sliding) [25], which is robust to the noisy input signals. The observer implements the reduced-order Luenberger observation law, while assuming the output displacement is the only available measurement. The latter is relevant for multiple motion control applications with use of encoder-type sensors. The uniform asymptotic stability and convergence analysis of the proposed observer are elaborated in the present work by using the Lyapunov function-based stability criterion by Ignatyev and imposing parametric constraints on the time-dependent eigenvalues of the system matrix to be always negative real. A design procedure for assigning a dominant, and thus slowest, real pole of the observer is proposed. Explanative numerical examples accompany the developed analysis. In addition, a thorough experimental evaluation is given for the proposed observer-based friction compensation which is performed for positioning and tracking tasks. The observer-based compensation, which can serve as a plug-in to a standard feedback controller, extends a PID feedback control that is optimally tuned for disturbance suppression. The experimental results are compared with and without the plugged-in observer-based compensator.

Title: The Eye as a Window to Systemic Health: A Survey of Retinal Imaging from Classical Techniques to Oculomics
Authors: Inamullah, Imran Razzak, Shoaib Jameel
Abstract: The unique vascularized anatomy of the human eye, encased in the retina, provides an opportunity to act as a window for human health. The retinal structure assists in assessing the early detection, monitoring of disease progression and intervention for both ocular and non-ocular diseases. The advancement in imaging technology leveraging Artificial Intelligence has seized this opportunity to bridge the gap between the eye and human health. This track paves the way for unveiling systemic health insight from the ocular system and surrogating non-invasive markers for timely intervention and identification. The new frontiers of oculomics in ophthalmology cover both ocular and systemic diseases, and getting more attention to explore them. In this survey paper, we explore the evolution of retinal imaging techniques, the dire need for the integration of AI-driven analysis, and the shift of retinal imaging from classical techniques to oculomics. We also discuss some hurdles that may be faced in the progression of oculomics, highlighting the research gaps and future directions.

Title: Text-guided multi-stage cross-perception network for medical image segmentation
Authors: Gaoyu Chen, Haixia Pan
Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical medicine, serving as a key tool for auxiliary diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. However, traditional segmentation methods such as U-Net are often limited by weak semantic expression of target regions, which stems from insufficient generalization and a lack of interactivity. Incorporating text prompts offers a promising avenue to more accurately pinpoint lesion locations, yet existing text-guided methods are still hindered by insufficient cross-modal interaction and inadequate cross-modal feature representation. To address these challenges, we propose the Text-guided Multi-stage Cross-perception network (TMC). TMC incorporates a Multi-stage Cross-attention Module (MCM) to enhance the model's understanding of fine-grained semantic details and a Multi-stage Alignment Loss (MA Loss) to improve the consistency of cross-modal semantics across different feature levels. Experimental results on three public datasets (QaTa-COV19, MosMedData, and Duke-Breast-Cancer-MRI) demonstrate the superior performance of TMC, achieving Dice scores of 84.65\%, 78.39\%, and 88.09\%, respectively, and consistently outperforming both U-Net-based networks and existing text-guided methods.

Title: Fine-Tuning Large Audio-Language Models with LoRA for Precise Temporal Localization of Prolonged Exposure Therapy Elements
Authors: Suhas BN, Andrew M. Sherrill, Jyoti Alaparthi, Dominik Mattioli, Rosa I. Arriaga, Chris W. Wiese, Saeed Abdullah
Abstract: Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy is an effective treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but evaluating therapist fidelity remains labor-intensive due to the need for manual review of session recordings. We present a method for the automatic temporal localization of key PE fidelity elements, identifying their start and stop times, directly from session audio and transcripts. Our approach fine-tunes a large pre-trained audio-language model, Qwen2-Audio, using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to process focused 30-second windows of audio-transcript input. Fidelity labels for three core protocol phases, therapist orientation (P1), imaginal exposure (P2), and post-imaginal processing (P3), are generated via LLM-based prompting and verified by trained raters. The model is trained to predict normalized boundary offsets using soft supervision guided by task-specific prompts. On a dataset of 308 real PE sessions, our best configuration (LoRA rank 8, 30s windows) achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.3s across tasks, within typical rater tolerance for timestamp review, enabling practical fidelity QC. We further analyze the effects of window size and LoRA rank, highlighting the importance of context granularity and model adaptation. This work introduces a privacy-preserving, scalable framework for fidelity tracking in PE therapy, with potential to support clinician training, supervision, and quality assurance.

Title: A Secure Full-Duplex Wireless Circulator enabled by Non-Reciprocal Beyond-Diagonal RIS
Authors: Ziang Liu, Bruno Clerckx
Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has arisen as a promising technology for enhancing wireless communication systems by enabling flexible and intelligent wave manipulation. This is achieved through the interconnections among the ports of the impedance network, enabling wave reconfiguration when they flow through the surface. Thus, the output wave at one port depends on waves impinging on neighboring ports, allowing non-local control of both phase and magnitude. Non-reciprocal (NR)-BD-RIS further enhances this capability by breaking circuit reciprocity and, consequently, channel reciprocity. In contrast to conventional reciprocal (R)-BD-RIS and diagonal (D)-RIS that are constrained by circuit and channel reciprocity such that they only allow bidirectional communications, i.e., between UE1 and UE2, NR-BD-RIS can additionally enable uni-directional communications, that is, UE1 to UE2 to UE3, hence effectively enabling a wireless circulator. Specifically, this paper introduces a novel application of NR-BD-RIS in full-duplex (FD) wireless circulators, where multiple FD devices communicate via an NR-BD-RIS. This system is particularly beneficial for secure transmission, as it enforces one-way communication among FD devices, suppresses signal from all other users (UE), and thus prevents eavesdropping. In addition, a physics-compliant system model is considered by incorporating structural scattering, also known as specular reflection. By accounting for this effect, the advantages of NR-BD-RIS are further validated. Specifically, we formulate an sum-rate maximization problem and propose an iterative optimization algorithm that employs block coordinate descent (BCD) and penalty dual decomposition (PDD) methods. Numerical evaluations illustrate that NR-BD-RIS outperforms conventional R-BD-RIS and D-RIS in terms of sum-rate and secrecy rate.

Title: Combinatorial Control Barrier Functions: Nested Boolean and p-choose-r Compositions of Safety Constraints
Authors: Pio Ong, Haejoon Lee, Tamas G. Molnar, Dimitra Panagou, Aaron D. Ames
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of composing multiple control barrier functions (CBFs) -- and matrix control barrier functions (MCBFs) -- through logical and combinatorial operations. Standard CBF formulations naturally enable conjunctive (AND) combinations, but disjunctive (OR) and more general logical structures introduce nonsmoothness and possibly a combinatorial blow-up in the number of logical combinations. We introduce the framework of combinatorial CBFs that addresses p-choose-r safety specifications and their nested composition. The proposed framework ensures safety for the exact safe set in a scalable way, using the original number of primitive constraints. We establish theoretical guarantees on safety under these compositions, and we demonstrate their use on a patrolling problem in a multi-agent system.

Title: Decentralized Voltage Control of AC Microgrids with Constant Power Loads using Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Grigoris Michos, George C. Konstantopoulos
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel nonlinear decentralized voltage controller for constrained regulation of meshed AC Microgrid networks with high penetration of time-varying constant power loads. Modelling the load demand as a constantly evolving unknown disturbance, the network model is reformulated in a cascaded structure composed of a nominal, \ie uncertainty-free, and an error subsystem. By adopting a suitable control barrier function, we formulate a continuous-time control law and derive analytic conditions on the tuning parameters, such that the distance between the true and the nominal state trajectories is bounded. Under sufficient conditions, we prove asymptotic stability of the cascaded dynamics with respect to an equilibrium set and also provide an estimate of the region of attraction. In addition, it is rigorously shown that the proposed nonlinear control law enforces constrained regulation around a rated voltage value, without the need of saturation devices. The operation of the closed-loop system is illustrated both via simulation and real-time HIL scenarios, demonstrating bounded operation and convergence to a neighbourhood of the desired reference vector.

Title: From Raw Gaze to Meaningful Features: Assessment of Visual Behavior in Driving Simulator
Authors: Smilja Stokanović, Jaka Sodnik, Nadica Miljković
Abstract: A novel quantitative analytical approach to investigate eye movement behaviour in a driving simulator during three conditions: Baseline, Ride (simulated drive under normal visibility), and Fog (simulated drive under reduced visibility) is presented. We illustrate the proposed approach in a case study: eye tracking data from 24 participants are analyzed using 31 parameters, organized into three groups: (1) saccade features, (2) Bivariate Contour Ellipse Area (BCEA), and (3) blinking features. Across all feature groups, numerous statistically significant differences emerge between Baseline and the simulated drive conditions. Between Ride and Fog, saccade features show minimal changes (one out of 13), whereas BCEA (9 of 13) and blink features (four of 5) exhibit pronounced differences, highlighting the strong impact of reduced visibility on gaze stability and blinking behaviour. In addition to conventional gaze features, such as Mean Squared Error and entropy metrics, a new metric, inspired by the Guzik's Index (GI), is introduced through feature engineering to quantify fixation asymmetry along the major axis of the BCEA. The GI results suggest that gaze dispersion remains consistent across visibility conditions, but it is significantly higher during Baseline than during Fog and Ride conditions (p < 0.01). Overall, the presented findings demonstrate that a combination of the BCEA-based features with saccade and blink parameters provides a comprehensive understanding of visual attention and gaze stability in a driving simulator, while GI offers additional insights into fixation asymmetry under varying visibility conditions.

Title: Data-driven uncertainty-aware seakeeping prediction of the Delft 372 catamaran using ensemble Hankel dynamic mode decomposition
Authors: Giorgio Palma, Andrea Serani, Matteo Diez
Abstract: In this study, we present and validate an ensemble-based Hankel Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (HDMDc) for uncertainty-aware seakeeping predictions of a high-speed catamaran, namely the Delft 372 model. Experimental measurements (time histories) of wave elevation at the longitudinal center of gravity, heave, pitch, notional flight-deck velocity, notional bridge acceleration, and total resistance were collected from irregular wave basin tests on a 1:33.3 scale replica of the Delft 372 model under sea state 5 conditions at Fr = 0.425, and organized into training, validation, and test sets. The HDMDc algorithm constructs an equation-free linear reduced-order model of the seakeeping vessel by augmenting states and inputs with their time-lagged copies to capture nonlinear and memory effects. Two ensembling strategies, namely Bayesian HDMDc (BHDMDc), which samples hyperparameters considered stochastic variables with prior distribution to produce posterior mean forecasts with confidence intervals, and Frequentist HDMDc (FHDMDc), which aggregates multiple model obtained over data subsets, are compared in providing seakeeping prediction and uncertainty quantification. The FHDMDc approach is found to improve the accuracy of the predictions compared to the deterministic counterpart, also providing robust uncertainty estimation; whereas the application of BHDMDc to the present test case is not found beneficial in comparison to the deterministic model. FHDMDc-derived probability density functions for the motions closely match both experimental data and URANS results, demonstrating reliable and computationally efficient seakeeping prediction for design and operational support.

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) will become a service in future mobile communication networks. It enables the detection and recognition of passive objects and environments using radar-like sensing. The ultimate advantage is the reuse of the mobile network and radio access resources for scene illumination, sensing, data transportation, computation, and fusion. It enables building a distributed, ubiquitous sensing network that can be adapted for a variety of radio sensing tasks and services. In this article, we develop the principles of multi-sensor ISAC (MS-ISAC). MS-ISAC corresponds to multi-user MIMO communication, which in radar terminology is known as distributed MIMO radar. \ First, we develop basic architectural principles for MS-ISAC and link them to example use cases. We then propose a generic MS-ISAC architecture. After a brief reference to multipath propagation and multistatic target reflectivity issues, we outline multilink access, coordination, precoding and link adaptation schemes for MS-ISAC. Moreover, we review model-based estimation and tracking of delay~/~Doppler from sparse OFDMA~/~TDMA frames. We emphasize Cooperative Passive Coherent Location (CPCL) for bistatic correlation and synchronization. Finally, issues of multisensor node synchronization and distributed data fusion are addressed.

Title: V-Rex: Real-Time Streaming Video LLM Acceleration via Dynamic KV Cache Retrieval
Authors: Donghyuk Kim, Sejeong Yang, Wonjin Shin, Joo-Young Kim
Abstract: Streaming video large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for real-time multimodal tasks such as video captioning, question answering, conversational agents, and augmented reality. However, these models face fundamental memory and computational challenges because their key-value (KV) caches grow substantially with continuous streaming video input. This process requires an iterative prefill stage, which is a unique feature of streaming video LLMs. Due to its iterative prefill stage, it suffers from significant limitations, including extensive computation, substantial data transfer, and degradation in accuracy. Crucially, this issue is exacerbated for edge deployment, which is the primary target for these models. In this work, we propose V-Rex, the first software-hardware co-designed accelerator that comprehensively addresses both algorithmic and hardware bottlenecks in streaming video LLM inference. At its core, V-Rex introduces ReSV, a training-free dynamic KV cache retrieval algorithm. ReSV exploits temporal and spatial similarity-based token clustering to reduce excessive KV cache memory across video frames. To fully realize these algorithmic benefits, V-Rex offers a compact, low-latency hardware accelerator with a dynamic KV cache retrieval engine (DRE), featuring bit-level and early-exit based computing units. V-Rex achieves unprecedented real-time of 3.9-8.3 FPS and energy-efficient streaming video LLM inference on edge deployment with negligible accuracy loss. While DRE only accounts for 2.2% power and 2.0% area, the system delivers 1.9-19.7x speedup and 3.1-18.5x energy efficiency improvements over AGX Orin GPU. This work is the first to comprehensively tackle KV cache retrieval across algorithms and hardware, enabling real-time streaming video LLM inference on resource-constrained edge devices.

Title: Observer-based Differentially Private Consensus for Linear Multi-agent Systems
Authors: Xiaofeng Zong, Ming-Yu Wang, Jimin Wang, Ji-Feng Zhang
Abstract: This paper investigates the differentially private consensus problem for general linear multi-agent systems (MASs) based on output feedback protocols. To protect the output information, which is considered private data and may be at high risk of exposure, Laplace noise is added to the information exchange. The conditions for achieving mean square and almost sure consensus in observer-based MASs are established using the backstepping method and the convergence theory for nonnegative almost supermartingales. It is shown that the separation principle remains valid for the consensus problem of linear MASs with decaying Laplace noise. Furthermore, the convergence rate is provided. Then, a joint design framework is developed for state estimation gain, feedback control gain, and noise to ensure the preservation of \epsilon-differential privacy. The output information of each agent is shown to be protected at every time step. Finally, sufficient conditions are established for simultaneously achieving consensus and preserving differential privacy for linear MASs utilizing both full-order and reduced-order observers. Meanwhile, an \epsilon*-differentially private consensus is achieved to meet the desired privacy level. Two simulation examples are provided to validate the theoretical results.

Title: Accelerating Hybrid Model Predictive Control using Warm-Started Generalized Benders Decomposition
Authors: Xuan Lin
Abstract: Hybrid model predictive control with both continuous and discrete variables is widely applicable to robotic control tasks, especially those involving contacts with the environment. Due to combinatorial complexity, the solving speed of hybrid MPC can be insufficient for real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a hybrid MPC algorithm based on Generalized Benders Decomposition. The algorithm enumerates and stores cutting planes online inside a finite buffer and transfers them across MPC iterations to provide warm-starts for new problem instances, significantly enhancing solving speed. We theoretically analyze this warm-starting performance by modeling the deviation of mode sequences through temporal shifting and stretching, deriving bounds on the dual gap between transferred optimality cuts and the true optimal costs, and utilizing these bounds to quantify the level of suboptimality guaranteed in the first solve of the Benders Master Problem. Our algorithm is validated in simulation through controlling a cart-pole system with soft contact walls, a free-flying robot navigating around obstacles, and a humanoid robot standing on one leg while pushing against walls with its hands for balance. For our benchmark problems, the algorithm enumerates cuts on the order of only tens to hundreds while reaching speeds 2-3 times faster than the off-the-shelf solver Gurobi, oftentimes exceeding 1000 Hz.

Title: Optimal Error Analysis of Channel Estimation for IRS-assisted MIMO Systems
Authors: Zhen Qin, Zhihui Zhu
Abstract: As intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as a new and promising technology capable of configuring the wireless environment favorably, channel estimation for IRS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems has garnered extensive attention in recent years. Despite the development of numerous algorithms to address this challenge, a comprehensive theoretical characterization of the optimal recovery error is still lacking. This paper aims to address this gap by providing theoretical guarantees in terms of stable recovery of channel matrices for noisy measurements. We begin by establishing the equivalence between IRS-assisted MIMO systems in the uplink scenario and a compact tensor train (TT)-based tensor-on-tensor (ToT) regression. Building on this equivalence, we then investigate the restricted isometry property (RIP) for complex-valued subgaussian measurements. Our analysis reveals that successful recovery hinges on the relationship between the number of user terminals and the number of time slots during which channel matrices remain invariant. Utilizing the RIP condition, we establish a theoretical upper bound on the recovery error for solutions to the constrained least-squares optimization problem, as well as a minimax lower bound for the considered model. Our analysis demonstrates that the recovery error decreases inversely with the number of time slots, and increases proportionally with the total number of unknown entries in the channel matrices, thereby quantifying the fundamental trade-offs in channel estimation accuracy. In addition, we explore a multi-hop IRS scheme and analyze the corresponding recovery errors. Finally, we have performed numerical experiments to support our theoretical findings.

Title: Set-theoretic solution for the tuning problem
Authors: Vsevolod Vladimirovich Deriushkin
Abstract: In this paper I want to suggest a new solution to the problem of musical tuning. On one hand, I see it as a generalization of Just Intonation (JI) to inharmonic timbers, on another, as a unification of spectral interference and harmonicity contributions to consonance within a single framework. The main achievement of the work is the ability to mathematically quantify the phenomenon of musical consonance using set theory. That quantification is done by defining two measures of consonance: affinity and harmonicity. These measures naturally generate sets of intervals that can be used as dynamic tuning systems. The paper is aimed at a broad audience of people who may not be skilled in music and tuning theory or mathematics. Thus, I attempt to give as much details and explanations as I can, while keeping the number of pages as low as possible.

Abstract: In recent years, automatic speech recognition (ASR) has witnessed transformative advancements driven by three complementary paradigms: data scaling, model size scaling, and deep integration with large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs are prone to hallucination, which can significantly degrade user experience in real-world ASR applications. In this paper, we present Fun-ASR, a large-scale, LLM-based ASR system that synergistically combines massive data, large model capacity, LLM integration, and reinforcement learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse and complex speech recognition scenarios. Moreover, Fun-ASR is specifically optimized for practical deployment, with enhancements in streaming capability, noise robustness, code-switching, hotword customization, and satisfying other real-world application requirements. Experimental results show that while most LLM-based ASR systems achieve strong performance on open-source benchmarks, they often underperform on real industry evaluation sets. Thanks to production-oriented optimizations, Fun-ASR achieves state-of-the-art performance on real application datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in practical settings.

Title: A Review of Software for Designing and Operating Quantum Networks
Authors: Robert J. Hayek, Joaquin Chung, Rajkumar Kettimuthu
Abstract: Quantum network protocol development is crucial to realizing a production-grade network that can support distributed sensing, secure communication, and utility-scale quantum computation. However, the transition from laboratory demonstration to deployable networks requires software implementations of architectures and protocols tailored to the unique constraints of quantum systems. This paper reviews the current state of software implementations for quantum networks, organized around the three-plane abstraction of infrastructure, logical, and control/service planes. We cover software for both designing quantum network protocols (e.g., SeQUeNCe, QuISP, and NetSquid) and operating them, with a focus on essential control/service plane functions such as entanglement, topology, and resource management, in a proposed taxonomy. Our review highlights a persistent gap between theoretical protocol proposals and their realization in simulators or testbeds, particularly in dynamic topology and network management. We conclude by outlining open challenges and proposing a roadmap for developing scalable software architectures to enable hybrid, large-scale quantum networks.

Title: Cooperative Task Spaces for Multi-Arm Manipulation Control based on Similarity Transformations
Authors: Tobias Löw, Cem Bilaloglu, Sylvain Calinon
Abstract: Many tasks in human environments require collaborative behavior between multiple kinematic chains, either to provide additional support for carrying big and bulky objects or to enable the dexterity that is required for in-hand manipulation. Since these complex systems often have a very high number of degrees of freedom coordinating their movements is notoriously difficult to model. In this article, we present the derivation of the theoretical foundations for cooperative task spaces of multi-arm robotic systems based on geometric primitives defined using conformal geometric algebra. Based on the similarity transformations of these cooperative geometric primitives, we derive an abstraction of complex robotic systems that enables representing these systems in a way that directly corresponds to single-arm systems. By deriving the associated analytic and geometric Jacobian matrices, we then show the straightforward integration of our approach into classical control techniques rooted in operational space control. We demonstrate this using bimanual manipulators, humanoids and multi-fingered hands in optimal control experiments for reaching desired geometric primitives and in teleoperation experiments using differential kinematics control. We then discuss how the geometric primitives naturally embed nullspace structures into the controllers that can be exploited for introducing secondary control objectives. This work, represents the theoretical foundations of this cooperative manipulation control framework, and thus the experiments are presented in an abstract way, while giving pointers towards potential future applications.

Title: AutoRec: Accelerating Loss Recovery for Live Streaming in a Multi-Supplier Market
Authors: Tong Li, Xu Yan, Bo Wu, Cheng Luo, Fuyu Wang, Jiuxiang Zhu, Haoyi Fang, Xinle Du, Ke Xu
Abstract: Due to the limited permissions for upgrading dualside (i.e., server-side and client-side) loss tolerance schemes from the perspective of CDN vendors in a multi-supplier market, modern large-scale live streaming services are still using the automatic-repeat-request (ARQ) based paradigm for loss recovery, which only requires server-side modifications. In this paper, we first conduct a large-scale measurement study with up to 50 million live streams. We find that loss shows dynamics and live streaming contains frequent on-off mode switching in the wild. We further find that the recovery latency, enlarged by the ubiquitous retransmission loss, is a critical factor affecting live streaming's client-side QoE (e.g., video freezing). We then propose an enhanced recovery mechanism called AutoRec, which can transform the disadvantages of on-off mode switching into an advantage for reducing loss recovery latency without any modifications on the client side. AutoRec allows users to customize overhead tolerance and recovery latency tolerance and adaptively adjusts strategies as the network environment changes to ensure that recovery latency meets user demands whenever possible while keeping overhead under control. We implement AutoRec upon QUIC and evaluate it via testbed and real-world commercial services deployments. The experimental results demonstrate the practicability and profitability of AutoRec.
