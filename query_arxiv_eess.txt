Title: Q-Probe: Scaling Image Quality Assessment to High Resolution via Context-Aware Agentic Probing
Authors: Xiang Li, XueHeng Li, Yu Wang, XuanHua He, ZhangChi Hu, WeiWei Yu, ChengJun Xie
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empowered Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to achieve superior human preference alignment in Image Quality Assessment (IQA). However, existing RL-based IQA models typically rely on coarse-grained global views, failing to capture subtle local degradations in high-resolution scenarios. While emerging "Thinking with Images" paradigms enable multi-scale visual perception via zoom-in mechanisms, their direct adaptation to IQA induces spurious "cropping-implies-degradation" biases and misinterprets natural depth-of-field as artifacts. To address these challenges, we propose Q-Probe, the first agentic IQA framework designed to scale IQA to high resolution via context-aware probing. First, we construct Vista-Bench, a pioneering benchmark tailored for fine-grained local degradation analysis in high-resolution IQA settings. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage training paradigm that progressively aligns the model with human preferences, while simultaneously eliminating causal bias through a novel context-aware cropping strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Probe achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-resolution settings while maintaining superior efficacy across resolution scales.

Title: High-Fidelity 3D Tooth Reconstruction by Fusing Intraoral Scans and CBCT Data via a Deep Implicit Representation
Authors: Yi Zhu, Razmig Kechichian, Raphaël Richert, Satoshi Ikehata, Sébastien Valette
Abstract: High-fidelity 3D tooth models are essential for digital dentistry, but must capture both the detailed crown and the complete root. Clinical imaging modalities are limited: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) captures the root but has a noisy, low-resolution crown, while Intraoral Scanners (IOS) provide a high-fidelity crown but no root information. A naive fusion of these sources results in unnatural seams and artifacts. We propose a novel, fully-automated pipeline that fuses CBCT and IOS data using a deep implicit representation. Our method first segments and robustly registers the tooth instances, then creates a hybrid proxy mesh combining the IOS crown and the CBCT root. The core of our approach is to use this noisy proxy to guide a class-specific DeepSDF network. This optimization process projects the input onto a learned manifold of ideal tooth shapes, generating a seamless, watertight, and anatomically coherent model. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show our method uniquely preserves both the high-fidelity crown from IOS and the patient-specific root morphology from CBCT, overcoming the limitations of each modality and naive stitching.

Title: Aligned Stable Inpainting: Mitigating Unwanted Object Insertion and Preserving Color Consistency
Authors: Yikai Wang, Junqiu Yu, Chenjie Cao, Xiangyang Xue, Yanwei Fu
Abstract: Generative image inpainting can produce realistic, high-fidelity results even with large, irregular masks. However, existing methods still face key issues that make inpainted images look unnatural. In this paper, we identify two main problems: (1) Unwanted object insertion: generative models may hallucinate arbitrary objects in the masked region that do not match the surrounding context. (2) Color inconsistency: inpainted regions often exhibit noticeable color shifts, leading to smeared textures and degraded image quality. We analyze the underlying causes of these issues and propose efficient post-hoc solutions for pre-trained inpainting models. Specifically, we introduce the principled framework of Aligned Stable inpainting with UnKnown Areas prior (ASUKA). To reduce unwanted object insertion, we use reconstruction-based priors to guide the generative model, suppressing hallucinated objects while preserving generative flexibility. To address color inconsistency, we design a specialized VAE decoder that formulates latent-to-image decoding as a local harmonization task. This design significantly reduces color shifts and produces more color-consistent results. We implement ASUKA on two representative inpainting architectures: a U-Net-based model and a DiT-based model. We analyze and propose lightweight injection strategies that minimize interference with the model's original generation capacity while ensuring the mitigation of the two issues. We evaluate ASUKA using the Places2 dataset and MISATO, our proposed diverse benchmark. Experiments show that ASUKA effectively suppresses object hallucination and improves color consistency, outperforming standard diffusion, rectified flow models, and other inpainting methods. Dataset, models and codes will be released in github.

Title: OpenVision 3: A Family of Unified Visual Encoder for Both Understanding and Generation
Authors: Letian Zhang, Sucheng Ren, Yanqing Liu, Xianhang Li, Zeyu Wang, Yuyin Zhou, Huaxiu Yao, Zeyu Zheng, Weili Nie, Guilin Liu, Zhiding Yu, Cihang Xie
Abstract: This paper presents a family of advanced vision encoder, named OpenVision 3, that learns a single, unified visual representation that can serve both image understanding and image generation. Our core architecture is simple: we feed VAE-compressed image latents to a ViT encoder and train its output to support two complementary roles. First, the encoder output is passed to the ViT-VAE decoder to reconstruct the original image, encouraging the representation to capture generative structure. Second, the same representation is optimized with contrastive learning and image-captioning objectives, strengthening semantic features. By jointly optimizing reconstruction- and semantics-driven signals in a shared latent space, the encoder learns representations that synergize and generalize well across both regimes. We validate this unified design through extensive downstream evaluations with the encoder frozen. For multimodal understanding, we plug the encoder into the LLaVA-1.5 framework: it performs comparably with a standard CLIP vision encoder (e.g., 62.4 vs 62.2 on SeedBench, and 83.7 vs 82.9 on POPE). For generation, we test it under the RAE framework: ours substantially surpasses the standard CLIP-based encoder (e.g., gFID: 1.89 vs 2.54 on ImageNet). We hope this work can spur future research on unified modeling.

Title: ISAC-over-NTN: HAPS-UAV Framework for Post-Disaster Responsive 6G Networks
Authors: Berk Ciloglu, Ozgun Ersoy, Metin Ozturk, Ali Gorcin
Abstract: In disaster scenarios, ensuring both reliable communication and situational awareness becomes a critical challenge due to the partial or complete collapse of terrestrial networks. This paper proposes an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) over non-terrestrial networks (NTN) architecture referred to as ISAC-over-NTN that integrates multiple uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) and a high-altitude platform station (HAPS) to maintain resilient and reliable network operations in post-disaster conditions. We aim to achieve two main objectives: i) provide a reliable communication infrastructure, thereby ensuring the continuity of search-and-rescue activities and connecting people to their loved ones, and ii) detect users, such as those trapped under rubble or those who are mobile, using a Doppler-based mobility detection model. We employ an innovative beamforming method that simultaneously transmits data and detects Doppler-based mobility by integrating multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) communication and monostatic sensing within the same transmission chain. The results show that the proposed framework maintains reliable connectivity and achieves high detection accuracy of users in critical locations, reaching 90% motion detection sensitivity and 88% detection accuracy.

Title: DynamicSound simulator for simulating moving sources and microphone arrays
Authors: Luca Barbisan, Marco Levorato, Fabrizio Riente
Abstract: Developing algorithms for sound classification, detection, and localization requires large amounts of flexible and realistic audio data, especially when leveraging modern machine learning and beamforming techniques. However, most existing acoustic simulators are tailored for indoor environments and are limited to static sound sources, making them unsuitable for scenarios involving moving sources, moving microphones, or long-distance propagation. This paper presents DynamicSound an open-source acoustic simulation framework for generating multichannel audio from one or more sound sources with the possibility to move them continuously in three-dimensional space and recorded by arbitrarily configured microphone arrays. The proposed model explicitly accounts for finite sound propagation delays, Doppler effects, distance-dependent attenuation, air absorption, and first-order reflections from planar surfaces, yielding temporally consistent spatial audio signals. Unlike conventional mono or stereo simulators, the proposed system synthesizes audio for an arbitrary number of virtual microphones, accurately reproducing inter-microphone time delays, level differences, and spectral coloration induced by the environment. Comparative evaluations with existing open-source tools demonstrate that the generated signals preserve high spatial fidelity across varying source positions and acoustic conditions. By enabling the generation of realistic multichannel audio under controlled and repeatable conditions, the proposed open framework provides a flexible and reproducible tool for the development, training, and evaluation of modern spatial audio and sound-source localization algorithms.

Title: Achievable Rate Optimization for Large Flexible Intelligent Metasurface Assisted Downlink MISO under Statistical CSI
Authors: Ling He, Vaibhav Kumar, Anastasios Papazafeiropoulos, Miaowen Wen, Le-Nam Tran, Marwa Chafii
Abstract: The integration of electromagnetic metasurfaces into wireless communications enables intelligent control of the propagation environment. Recently, flexible intelligent metasurfaces (FIMs) have evolved beyond conventional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), enabling three-dimensional surface deformation for adaptive wave manipulation. However, most existing FIM-aided system designs assume perfect instantaneous channel state information (CSI), which is impractical in large-scale networks due to the high training overhead and complicated channel estimation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a robust statistical-CSI-based optimization framework for downlink multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems with FIM-assisted transmitters. A block coordinate ascent (BCA)-based iterative algorithm is developed to jointly optimize power allocation and FIM morphing, maximizing the average achievable sum rate. Simulation results show that the proposed statistical-CSI-driven FIM design significantly outperforms conventional rigid antenna arrays (RAAs), validating its effectiveness and practicality.

Title: Semantics in Actuation Systems: From Age of Actuation to Age of Actuated Information
Authors: Ali Nikkhah, Anthony Ephremides, Nikolaos Pappas
Abstract: In this paper, we study the timeliness of actions in communication systems where actuation is constrained by control permissions or energy availability. Building on the Age of Actuation (AoA) metric, which quantifies the timeliness of actions independently of data freshness, we introduce a new metric, the \emph{Age of Actuated Information (AoAI)}. AoAI captures the end-to-end timeliness of actions by explicitly accounting for the age of the data packet at the moment it is actuated. We analyze and characterize both AoA and AoAI in discrete-time systems with data storage capabilities under multiple actuation scenarios. The actuator requires both a data packet and an actuation opportunity, which may be provided by a controller or enabled by harvested energy. Data packets may be stored either in a single-packet buffer or an infinite-capacity queue for future actuation. For these settings, we derive closed-form expressions for the average AoA and AoAI and investigate their structural differences. While AoA and AoAI coincide in instantaneous actuation systems, they differentiate when data buffering is present. Our results reveal counterintuitive regimes in which increasing update or actuation rates degrade action timeliness for both AoA and AoAI. Moreover, as part of the analysis, we obtain a novel closed-form characterization of the steady-state distribution of a Geo/Geo/1 queue operating under the FCFS discipline, expressed solely in terms of the queue length and the age of the head-of-line packet. The proposed metrics and analytical results provide new insights into the semantics of timeliness in systems where information ultimately serves the purpose of actuation.

Title: Applicability and Limitation Analysis of PMU Data and Phasor Concept for Low- and High- Frequency Oscillations
Authors: Bowen Ou, Bin Wang, Slava Maslennikov, Hanchao Liu, Jim Follum
Abstract: Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) convert high-speed waveform data into low-speed phasor data, which are fundamental to wide-area monitoring and control in power systems, with oscillation detection and localization among their most prominent applications. However, representing electrical waveform signals with oscillations using PMU phasors is effective only for low-frequency oscillations. This paper investigates the root causes of this limitation, focusing on errors introduced by Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based signal processing, in addition to the attenuation effects of anti-aliasing filters, and the impact of low reporting rates. To better represent and estimate waveform signals with oscillations, we propose a more general signal model and a multi-step estimation method that leverages one-cycle DFT, the Matrix Pencil Method, and the Least Squares Method. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed signal model and estimation method. Furthermore, this paper reveals that the phasor concept, let alone PMU phasors, can become invalid for waveform signals with high-frequency oscillations characterized by asymmetric sub- and super-synchronous components. These findings highlight the fundamental limitations of PMU data and phasor concept, and emphasize the need to rely on waveform data for analyzing high-frequency oscillations in modern power systems.

Title: A Machine Vision Approach to Preliminary Skin Lesion Assessments
Authors: Ali Khreis, Ro'Yah Radaideh, Quinn McGill
Abstract: Early detection of malignant skin lesions is critical for improving patient outcomes in aggressive, metastatic skin cancers. This study evaluates a comprehensive system for preliminary skin lesion assessment that combines the clinically established ABCD rule of dermoscopy (analyzing Asymmetry, Borders, Color, and Dermoscopic Structures) with machine learning classification. Using a 1,000-image subset of the HAM10000 dataset, the system implements an automated, rule-based pipeline to compute a Total Dermoscopy Score (TDS) for each lesion. This handcrafted approach is compared against various machine learning solutions, including traditional classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM) and deep learning models. While the rule-based system provides high clinical interpretability, results indicate a performance bottleneck when reducing complex morphology to five numerical features. Experimental findings show that transfer learning with EfficientNet-B0 failed significantly due to domain shift between natural and medical images. In contrast, a custom three-layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained from scratch achieved 78.5% accuracy and 86.5% recall on median-filtered images, representing a 19-point accuracy improvement over traditional methods. The results demonstrate that direct pixel-level learning captures diagnostic patterns beyond handcrafted features and that purpose-built lightweight architectures can outperform large pretrained models for small, domain-specific medical datasets.

Title: Distributed Uplink Anti-Jamming in LEO Mega-Constellations via Game-Theoretic Beamforming
Authors: Shizhen Jia, Mingjun Ying, Marco Mezzavilla, Theodore S. Rappaport, Sundeep Rangan
Abstract: Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations have become vital in emerging commercial and defense Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs). However, their predictable orbital dynamics and exposed geometries make them highly susceptible to ground-based jamming. Traditional single-satellite interference mitigation techniques struggle to spatially separate desired uplink signals from nearby jammers, even with large antenna arrays. This paper explores a distributed multi-satellite anti-jamming strategy leveraging the dense connectivity and high-speed inter-satellite links of modern LEO mega-constellations. We model the uplink interference scenario as a convex-concave game between a desired terrestrial transmitter and a jammer, each optimizing their spatial covariance matrices to maximize or minimize achievable rate. We propose an efficient min-max solver combining alternating best-response updates with projected gradient descent, achieving fast convergence of the beamforming strategy to the Nash equilibrium. Using realistic Starlink orbital geometries and Sionna ray-tracing simulations, we demonstrate that while close-proximity jammers can cripple single-satellite links, distributed satellite cooperation significantly enhances resilience, shifting the capacity distribution upward under strong interference.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of cervical structures in transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) is critical for assessing the risk of spontaneous preterm birth (PTB), yet the scarcity of labeled data limits the performance of supervised learning approaches. This paper introduces the Fetal Ultrasound Grand Challenge (FUGC), the first benchmark for semi-supervised learning in cervical segmentation, hosted at ISBI 2025. FUGC provides a dataset of 890 TVS images, including 500 training images, 90 validation images, and 300 test images. Methods were evaluated using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff Distance (HD), and runtime (RT), with a weighted combination of 0.4/0.4/0.2. The challenge attracted 10 teams with 82 participants submitting innovative solutions. The best-performing methods for each individual metric achieved 90.26\% mDSC, 38.88 mHD, and 32.85 ms RT, respectively. FUGC establishes a standardized benchmark for cervical segmentation, demonstrates the efficacy of semi-supervised methods with limited labeled data, and provides a foundation for AI-assisted clinical PTB risk assessment.

Title: An Iterated Hybrid Fast Parallel FIR Filter
Authors: Keshab K. Parhi
Abstract: This paper revisits the design and optimization of parallel fast finite impulse response (FIR) filters using polyphase decomposition and iterated fast FIR algorithms (FFAs). Parallel FIR filtering enhances computational efficiency and throughput in digital signal processing (DSP) applications by enabling the simultaneous processing of multiple input samples. We revisit a prior approach to design of fast parallel filter architectures by using the iterated FFA approach where the same primitive filter, such as 2-parallel, is iterated to design the fast parallel filter. In this paper, we present yet another novel iterated fast parallel FIR filter, referred to as the fast hybrid filter. The hybrid filter iterates a transposed 2-parallel fast FIR filter in all the inner layers and a direct-form 2-parallel fast FIR filter in the outermost layer, resulting in reduced hardware complexity. Such an iterated hybrid approach has not been presented before. We show that the hybrid fast parallel filters require less number of additions compared to prior approaches.

Title: Amalgamated CHIRP and OFDM for ISAC
Authors: Pankaj Kumar, Mohammed El-Hajjar, Ibrahim A. Hemadeh, Yasser Mestrah, Suraj Srivastava, Aditya K. Jagannatham, Lajos Hanzo
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) requires the development of a waveform capable of efficiently supporting both communication and sensing functionalities. This paper proposes a novel waveform that combines the benefits of both the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and the chirp waveforms to improve both the communication and sensing performance within an ISAC framework. Hence, a new architecture is proposed that utilizes the conventional communication framework while leveraging the parameters sensed at the receiver (Rx) for enhancing the communication performance. We demonstrate that the affine addition of OFDM and chirp signals results in a near constant-envelope OFDM waveform, which effectively reduces the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), a key limitation of traditional OFDM systems. Using the OFDM framework for sensing in the conventional fashion requires the allocation of some resources for sensing, which in turn reduces communication performance. As a remedy, the proposed affine amalgam facilitates sensing through the chirp waveform without consuming communication resources, thereby preserving communication efficiency. Furthermore, a novel technique of integrating the chirp signal into the OFDM framework at the slot-level is proposed to enhance the accuracy of range estimation. The results show that the OFDM signal incorporated with chirp has better autocorrelation properties, improved root mean square error (RMSE) of range and velocity, and lower PAPR. Finally, we characterize the trade-off between communications and sensing performance.

Title: Does 6G Need a New Waveform: Comparing Zak-OTFS with CP-OFDM
Authors: Imran Ali Khan, Saif Khan Mohammed, Ronny Hadani, Ananthanarayanan Chockalingam, Robert Calderbank, Anton Monk, Shachar Kons, Shlomo Rakib, Yoav Hebron
Abstract: Across the world, there is growing interest in new waveforms, Zak-OTFS in particular, and over-the-air implementations are starting to appear. The choice between OFDM and Zak-OTFS is not so much a choice between waveforms as it is an architectural choice between preventing inter-carrier interference (ICI) and embracing ICI. In OFDM, once the Input-Output (I/O) relation is known, equalization is relatively simple, at least when there is no ICI. However, in the presence of ICI the I/O relation is non-predictable and its acquisition is non-trivial. In contrast, equalization is more involved in Zak-OTFS due to inter-symbol-interference (ISI), however the I/O relation is predictable and its acquisition is simple. {Zak-OTFS exhibits superior performance in doubly-spread 6G use cases with high delay/Doppler channel spreads (i.e., high mobility and/or large cells), but architectural choice is governed by the typical use case, today and in the future. What is typical depends to some degree on geography, since large delay spread is a characteristic of large cells which are the rule rather than the exception in many important wireless markets.} This paper provides a comprehensive performance comparison of cyclic prefix OFDM (CP-OFDM) and Zak-OTFS across the full range of 6G propagation environments. The performance results provide insights into the fundamental architectural choice.

Title: Design, Modelling, and Control of Magnetic Ball Suspension System
Authors: Sampson E. Nwachukwu
Abstract: This paper presents the modeling, control design, and performance analysis of a Magnetic Ball Suspension System (MBSS), a nonlinear and inherently unstable electromechanical system used in various precision applications. The system's primary objective is to levitate a steel ball using electromagnetic force without physical contact, thereby eliminating frictional losses. A comprehensive state-space model was developed, capturing both the mechanical and electrical dynamics. The equilibrium points of the system were determined through feedback linearization using the Jacobian matrix. To ensure system stability, controllability and observability analyses were conducted, confirming that state feedback and observer-based control strategies could be effectively implemented. Three distinct control methods were explored: pole placement-based state feedback control, full-order observer design, and optimal state feedback control using the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). Each control strategy was validated through Simulink simulations for both linearized and nonlinear models. Simulation results demonstrated that the linearized system consistently achieved desired performance with minimal oscillations, whereas the nonlinear system exhibited significant transient oscillations before stabilization. The full-order observer enhanced estimation accuracy, enabling effective control where direct state measurement was impractical. The LQR-based control offered improved robustness and minimized control effort, though its performance was comparable to standard state feedback in some cases.

Title: Bridging Qualitative Rubrics and AI: A Binary Question Framework for Criterion-Referenced Grading in Engineering
Authors: Lili Chen, Winn Wing-Yiu Chow, Stella Peng, Bencheng Fan, Sachitha Bandara
Abstract: PURPOSE OR GOAL: This study investigates how GenAI can be integrated with a criterion-referenced grading framework to improve the efficiency and quality of grading for mathematical assessments in engineering. It specifically explores the challenges demonstrators face with manual, model solution-based grading and how a GenAI-supported system can be designed to reliably identify student errors, provide high-quality feedback, and support human graders. The research also examines human graders' perceptions of the effectiveness of this GenAI-assisted approach. ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES: The study found that GenAI achieved an overall grading accuracy of 92.5%, comparable to two experienced human graders. The two researchers, who also served as subject demonstrators, perceived the GenAI as a helpful second reviewer that improved accuracy by catching small errors and provided more complete feedback than they could manually. A central outcome was the significant enhancement of formative feedback. However, they noted the GenAI tool is not yet reliable enough for autonomous use, especially with unconventional solutions. CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS/SUMMARY: This study demonstrates that GenAI, when paired with a structured, criterion-referenced framework using binary questions, can grade engineering mathematical assessments with an accuracy comparable to human experts. Its primary contribution is a novel methodological approach that embeds the generation of high-quality, scalable formative feedback directly into the assessment workflow. Future work should investigate student perceptions of GenAI grading and feedback.

Title: Distributed Multichannel Active Noise Control with Asynchronous Communication
Authors: Junwei Ji, Dongyuan Shi, Boxiang Wang, Ziyi Yang, Haowen Li, Woon-Seng Gan
Abstract: Distributed multichannel active noise control (DMCANC) offers effective noise reduction across large spatial areas by distributing the computational load of centralized control to multiple low-cost nodes. Conventional DMCANC methods, however, typically assume synchronous communication and require frequent data exchange, resulting in high communication overhead. To enhance efficiency and adaptability, this work proposes an asynchronous communication strategy where each node executes a weight-constrained filtered-x LMS (WCFxLMS) algorithm and independently requests communication only when its local noise reduction performance degrades. Upon request, other nodes transmit the weight difference between their local control filter and the center point in WCFxLMS, which are then integrated to update both the control filter and the center point. This design enables nodes to operate asynchronously while preserving cooperative behavior. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed asynchronous communication DMCANC (ACDMCANC) system maintains effective noise reduction with significantly reduced communication load, offering improved scalability for heterogeneous networks.

Abstract: This article presents and discusses challenges and solutions for practical issues in bistatic integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in 6G networks. Considering orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing as the adopted waveform, a discussion on system design aiming to achieve both a desired sensing key performance indicators and limit the impact of hardware impairments is presented. In addition, signal processing techniques to enable over-the-air synchronization and generation of periodograms with range, Doppler shift, and angular information are discussed. Simulation results are then presented for a cellular-based ISAC scenario considering system parameterization compliant to current 5G and, finally, a discussion on open challenges for future deployments is presented.

Title: Joint Pilot and Unknown Data-based Localization for OFDM Opportunistic Radar Systems
Authors: Mathieu Reniers, Martin Willame, Jérôme Louveaux, Luc Vandendorpe
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for Sixth Generation (6G) and Wi-Fi 7 networks, with the communication-centric approach being particularly attractive due to its compatibility with current standards. Typical communication signals comprise both deterministic known pilot signals and random unknown data payloads. Most existing approaches either rely solely on pilots for positioning, thereby ignoring the radar information present in the received data symbols that constitute the majority of each frame, or rely on data decisions, which bounds positioning performance to that of the communication system. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method that extracts positioning information from data payloads without decoding them. We consider an opportunistic scenario in which communication signals from a user are captured by an opportunistic radar equipped with a Uniform Linear Arrays of antennas. We show that, in this setting, the estimation can be efficiently implemented using Fast Fourier Transforms. Finally, we demonstrate superior localization performance compared to existing methods in the literature through numerical simulations.

Title: Adaptive Non-Uniform Sampling of Bandlimited Signals via Algorithm-Encoder Co-Design
Authors: Kaluguri Yashaswini, Anshu Arora, Satish Mulleti
Abstract: We propose an adaptive non-uniform sampling framework for bandlimited signals based on an algorithm-encoder co-design perspective. By revisiting the convergence analysis of iterative reconstruction algorithms for non-uniform measurements, we derive a local, energy-based sufficient condition that governs reconstruction behavior as a function of the signal and derivative energies within each sampling interval. Unlike classical approaches that impose a global Nyquist-type bound on the inter-sample spacing, the proposed condition permits large gaps in slowly varying regions while enforcing denser sampling only where the signal exhibits rapid temporal variation. Building on this theoretical insight, we design a variable-bias, variable-threshold integrate-and-fire time encoding machine (VBT-IF-TEM) whose firing mechanism is explicitly shaped to enforce the derived local convergence condition. To ensure robustness, a shifted-signal formulation is introduced to suppress excessive firing in regions where the magnitude of the signal amplitude is close to zero or the local signal energy approaches zero. Using the proposed encoder, an analog signal is discretely represented by time encodings and signal averages, enabling perfect reconstruction via a standard iterative algorithm even when the local sampling rate falls below the Nyquist rate. Simulation results on synthetic signals and experiments on ultrasonic guided-wave and ECG signals demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves substantial reductions in sampling density compared to uniform sampling and conventional IF-TEMs, while maintaining accurate reconstruction. The results further highlight a controllable tradeoff between sampling density, reconstruction accuracy, and convergence behavior, which can be navigated through adaptive parameter selection.

Title: Virtual Traffic Police: Large Language Model-Augmented Traffic Signal Control for Unforeseen Incidents
Authors: Shiqi Wei, Qiqing Wang, Kaidi Yang
Abstract: Adaptive traffic signal control (TSC) has demonstrated strong effectiveness in managing dynamic traffic flows. However, conventional methods often struggle when unforeseen traffic incidents occur (e.g., accidents and road maintenance), which typically require labor-intensive and inefficient manual interventions by traffic police officers. Large Language Models (LLMs) appear to be a promising solution thanks to their remarkable reasoning and generalization capabilities. Nevertheless, existing works often propose to replace existing TSC systems with LLM-based systems, which can be (i) unreliable due to the inherent hallucinations of LLMs and (ii) costly due to the need for system replacement. To address the issues of existing works, we propose a hierarchical framework that augments existing TSC systems with LLMs, whereby a virtual traffic police agent at the upper level dynamically fine-tunes selected parameters of signal controllers at the lower level in response to real-time traffic incidents. To enhance domain-specific reliability in response to unforeseen traffic incidents, we devise a self-refined traffic language retrieval system (TLRS), whereby retrieval-augmented generation is employed to draw knowledge from a tailored traffic language database that encompasses traffic conditions and controller operation principles. Moreover, we devise an LLM-based verifier to update the TLRS continuously over the reasoning process. Our results show that LLMs can serve as trustworthy virtual traffic police officers that can adapt conventional TSC methods to unforeseen traffic incidents with significantly improved operational efficiency and reliability.

Title: Dual-Mapping Sparse Vector Transmission for Short Packet URLLC
Authors: Yanfeng Zhang, Xu Zhu, Jinkai Zheng, Weiwei Yang, Xianhua Yu, Haiyong Zeng, Yujie Liu, Yong Liang Guan
Abstract: Sparse vector coding (SVC) is a promising short-packet transmission method for ultra reliable low latency communication (URLLC) in next generation communication systems. In this paper, a dual-mapping SVC (DM-SVC) based short packet transmission scheme is proposed to further enhance the transmission performance of SVC. The core idea behind the proposed scheme lies in mapping the transmitted information bits onto sparse vectors via block and single-element sparse mappings. The block sparse mapping pattern is able to concentrate the transmit power in a small number of non-zero blocks thus improving the decoding accuracy, while the single-element sparse mapping pattern ensures that the code length does not increase dramatically with the number of transmitted information bits. At the receiver, a two-stage decoding algorithm is proposed to sequentially identify non-zero block indexes and single-element non-zero indexes. Extensive simulation results verify that proposed DM-SVC scheme outperforms the existing SVC schemes in terms of block error rate and spectral efficiency.

Title: Separable Delay And Doppler Estimation In Passive Radar
Authors: Mats Viberg, Daniele Gerosa, Tomas McKelvey, Patrik Dammert, Thomas Eriksson
Abstract: In passive radar, a network of distributed sensors exploit signals from so-called Illuminators-of-Opportunity to detect and localize targets. We consider the case where the IO signal is available at each receiver node through a reference channel, whereas target returns corrupted by interference are collected in a separate surveillance channel. The problem formulation is similar to an active radar that uses a noise-like waveform, or an integrated sensing and communication application. The available data is first split into batches of manageable size. In the direct approach, the target's time-delay and Doppler parameters are estimated jointly by incoherently combining the batch-wise data. We propose a new method to estimate the time-delay separately, thus avoiding a costly 2-D search. Our approach is designed for slowly moving targets, and the accuracy of the time-delay estimate is similar to that of the full batch-wise 2-D method. Given the time-delay, the coherency between batches can be restored when estimating the Doppler parameter. Thereby, the separable approach is found to yield superior Doppler estimates over a wide parameter range. In addition to reducing computational complexity, the proposed separable estimation technique also significantly reduces the communication overhead in a distributed radar setting.

Title: Performance Analysis of Digital Beamforming mmWave MIMO with Low-Resolution DACs/ADCs
Authors: Faruk Pasic, Mariam Mussbah, Stefan Schwarz, Markus Rupp, Fredrik Tufvesson, Christoph F. Mecklenbräuker
Abstract: Future wireless communications will rely on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) beamforming operating at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency bands to deliver high data rates. To support flexible spatial processing and meet the demands of latency critical applications, it is essential to use fully digital mmWave MIMO beamforming, which relies on accurate channel estimation. However, ensuring power efficiency in fully digital mmWave MIMO systems requires the use of low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The reduced resolution of these quantizers introduces distortion in both transmitted and received signals, ultimately degrading system performance. In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation performance of mmWave MIMO systems employing fully digital beamforming with low-resolution quantization, under practical system constraints. We evaluate the system performance in terms of spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE). Simulation results demonstrate that a moderate quantization resolutions of 4-bit per DAC/ADC offers a favorable trade-off between energy consumption and achievable data rate.

Title: Time-Varying Rician K-factor in Measured Vehicular Channels at cmWave and mmWave Bands
Authors: Faruk Pasic, Markus Hofer, Thomas Zemen, Andreas F. Molisch, Christoph F. Mecklenbräuker
Abstract: Future vehicular communication systems will integrate millimeter wave (mmWave) technology to enhance data transmission rates. To investigate the propagation effects and small-scale fading differences between mmWave and conventional centimeter wave (cmWave) bands, multi-band channel measurements have to be conducted. One key parameter to characterize small-scale fading is the Rician K-factor. In this paper, we analyze the time-varying K-factor of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) channels across multiple frequency bands, measured in an urban street environment. Specifically, we investigate three frequency bands with center frequencies of 3.2 GHz, 34.3 GHz and 62.35 GHz using measurement data with 155.5 MHz bandwidth and a sounding repetition rate of 31.25 {\mu}s. Furthermore, we analyze the relationship between K-factor and root-mean-square (RMS) delay spread. We show that the Ricean K-factor is similar at different frequency bands and that is correlated with the RMS delay spread.

Title: A Stabilized Hybrid Active Noise Control Algorithm of GFANC and FxNLMS with Online Clustering
Authors: Zhengding Luo, Haozhe Ma, Boxiang Wang, Ziyi Yang, Dongyuan Shi, Woon-Seng Gan
Abstract: The Filtered-x Normalized Least Mean Square (FxNLMS) algorithm suffers from slow convergence and a risk of divergence, although it can achieve low steady-state errors after sufficient adaptation. In contrast, the Generative Fixed-Filter Active Noise Control (GFANC) method offers fast response speed, but its lack of adaptability may lead to large steady-state errors. This paper proposes a hybrid GFANC-FxNLMS algorithm to leverage the complementary advantages of both approaches. In the hybrid GFANC-FxNLMS algorithm, GFANC provides a frame-level control filter as an initialization for FxNLMS, while FxNLMS performs continuous adaptation at the sampling rate. Small variations in the GFANC-generated filter may repeatedly reinitialize FxNLMS, interrupting its adaptation process and destabilizing the system. An online clustering module is introduced to avoid unnecessary re-initializations and improve system stability. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves fast response, very low steady-state error, and high stability, requiring only one pre-trained broadband filter.

Title: Reconstructing Patched or Partial Holograms to allow for Whole Slide Imaging with a Self-Referencing Holographic Microscope
Authors: Philip Groult, Julia D. Sistermanns, Ellen Emken, Oliver Hayden, Wolfgang Utschick
Abstract: The last decade has seen significant advances in computer-aided diagnostics for cytological screening, mainly through the improvement and integration of scanning techniques such as whole slide imaging (WSI) and the combination with deep learning. Simultaneously, new imaging techniques such as quantitative phase imaging (QPI) are being developed to capture richer cell information with less sample preparation. So far, the two worlds of WSI and QPI have not been combined. In this work, we present a reconstruction algorithm which makes whole slide imaging of cervical smears possible by using a self-referencing three-wave digital holographic microscope. Since a WSI is constructed by combining multiple patches, the algorithm is adaptive and can be used on partial holograms and patched holograms. We present the algorithm for a single shot hologram, the adaptations to make it flexible to various inputs and show that the algorithm performs well for the tested epithelial cells. This is a preprint of our paper, which has been accepted for publication in 2026 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI).

Title: Performance Scaling Laws for PD Array-based Receivers in IM/DD Optical Wireless Communication Systems
Authors: Aravindh Krishnamoorthy, Robert Schober, Harald Haas
Abstract: We study the performance scaling laws for electrical-domain combining in photodetector (PD) array-based receivers employing intensity modulation and direct detection, taking into account the inherent square-law relationship between the optical and electrical received powers. The performance of PD array-based systems is compared, in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and achievable rate, to that of a reference receiver employing a single PD. Analytical and numerical results show that PD arrays provide performance gains for sufficiently narrow beams and above an SNR threshold. Furthermore, increasing the number of PDs alone does not enhance performance, and joint optimization of beam pattern, transverse electromagnetic mode, received power, and PD positions is necessary. Our model and derived insights provide practical guidelines and highlight the trade-offs for the design of next-generation high-bandwidth PD array receivers.

Title: Graph Topology Identification Based on Covariance Matching
Authors: Yongsheng Han, Raj Thilak Rajan, Geert Leus
Abstract: Graph topology identification (GTI) is a central challenge in networked systems, where the underlying structure is often hidden, yet nodal data are available. Conventional solutions to address these challenges rely on probabilistic models or complex optimization formulations, commonly suffering from non-convexity or requiring restrictive assumptions on acyclicity or positivity. In this paper, we propose a novel covariance matching (CovMatch) framework that directly aligns the empirical covariance of the observed data with the theoretical covariance implied by an underlying graph. We show that as long as the data-generating process permits an explicit covariance expression, CovMatch offers a unified route to topology inference. We showcase our methodology on linear structural equation models (SEMs), showing that CovMatch naturally handles both undirected and general sparse directed graphs - whether acyclic or positively weighted - without explicit knowledge of these structural constraints. Through appropriate reparameterizations, CovMatch simplifies the graph learning problem to either a conic mixed integer program for undirected graphs or an orthogonal matrix optimization for directed graphs. Numerical results confirm that, even for relatively large graphs, our approach efficiently recovers the true topology and outperforms standard baselines in accuracy. These findings highlight CovMatch as a powerful alternative to log-determinant or Bayesian methods for GTI, paving the way for broader research on learning complex network topologies with minimal assumptions.

Title: THOR: A Versatile Foundation Model for Earth Observation Climate and Society Applications
Authors: Theodor Forgaard, Jarle H. Reksten, Anders U. Waldeland, Valerio Marsocci, Nicolas Longépé, Michael Kampffmeyer, Arnt-Børre Salberg
Abstract: Current Earth observation foundation models are architecturally rigid, struggle with heterogeneous sensors and are constrained to fixed patch sizes. This limits their deployment in real-world scenarios requiring flexible computeaccuracy trade-offs. We propose THOR, a "computeadaptive" foundation model that solves both input heterogeneity and deployment rigidity. THOR is the first architecture to unify data from Copernicus Sentinel-1, -2, and -3 (OLCI & SLSTR) satellites, processing their native 10 m to 1000 m resolutions in a single model. We pre-train THOR with a novel randomized patch and input image size strategy. This allows a single set of pre-trained weights to be deployed at inference with any patch size, enabling a dynamic trade-off between computational cost and feature resolution without retraining. We pre-train THOR on THOR Pretrain, a new, large-scale multi-sensor dataset and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on downstream benchmarks, particularly in data-limited regimes like the PANGAEA 10% split, validating that THOR's flexible feature generation excels for diverse climate and society applications.

Title: Low-Complexity Sparse Superimposed Coding for Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications
Authors: Yanfeng Zhang, Xi'an Fan, Xu Zhu, Jinkai Zheng, Hui Liang, Weiwei Yang, Tom H. Luan
Abstract: Sparse superimposed coding (SSC) has emerged as a promising technique for short-packet transmission in ultra-reliable low-latency communication scenarios. However, conventional SSC schemes often suffer from high encoding and decoding complexity due to the use of dense codebook matrices. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity SSC scheme by designing a sparse codebook structure, where each codeword contains only a small number of non-zero elements. The decoding is performed using the traditional multipath matching pursuit algorithm, and the overall complexity is significantly reduced by exploiting the sparsity of the codebook. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a favorable trade-off between BLER performance and computational complexity, and exhibits strong robustness across different transmission block lengths.

Title: Stability Analysis of Power-Electronics-Dominated Grids Using Scaled Relative Graphs
Authors: Eder Baron-Prada, Adolfo Anta, Florian Dörfler
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to stability analysis for grid-connected converters utilizing Scaled Relative Graphs (SRG). Our method effectively decouples grid and converter dynamics, thereby establishing a comprehensive and efficient framework for evaluating closed-loop stability. Our analysis accommodates both linear and non-linear loads, enhancing its practical applicability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our stability assessment remains unaffected by angular variations resulting from dq-frame transformations, significantly increasing the method's robustness and versatility. The effectiveness of our approach is validated in several simulation case studies, which illustrate its broad applicability in modern power systems.

Title: Timbre-Aware LLM-based Direct Speech-to-Speech Translation Extendable to Multiple Language Pairs
Authors: Lalaram Arya, Mrinmoy Bhattacharjee, Adarsh C. R., S. R. Mahadeva Prasanna
Abstract: Direct Speech-to-Speech Translation (S2ST) has gained increasing attention for its ability to translate speech from one language to another, while reducing error propagation and latency inherent in traditional cascaded pipelines. However, existing direct S2ST systems continue to face notable challenges, including instability in semantic-acoustic alignment when parallel speech data is scarce, difficulty in preserving speaker identity, and limited multilingual scalability. In this work, we introduce DS2ST-LM, a scalable, single-stage direct S2ST framework leveraging a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM). The architecture integrates a Whisper speech encoder, a learnable projection module, a Qwen2-0.5B LLM, and a timbre-controlled vocoder. We construct GigaS2S-1000, a 1000-hour bilingual corpus by extending the GigaST dataset with high-fidelity synthetic target speech, and show that this synthetic data alleviates data scarcity to some extent. We investigate two semantic token generation strategies: speech-derived S3 tokens and text-derived tokens generated by a pre-trained LLM, and analyze their impact on training stability and semantic consistency. We further evaluate three projection architectures (Linear, Conv1D-Linear, and Q-Former) and observe that while higher-capacity projectors converge faster, the simple Linear projector achieves higher performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DS2ST-LM outperforms traditional cascaded and ST (Qwen-Audio) + TTS baselines across both lexical (BLEU, METEOR) and semantic (BLEURT, COMET) metrics, while extending to multiple language pairs, including French, Spanish, German, Hindi, Bengali, and Urdu. Furthermore, we incorporate timbre-aware speech synthesis to preserve speaker information, enabling DS2ST-LM to surpass prior direct S2ST systems in both speaker similarity and perceptual naturalness.

Title: Hybrid Channel Estimation with Quantized Phase Feedback for Over-the-Air Computation
Authors: Martin Dahl, Erik G. Larsson
Abstract: To reduce the signaling overhead of over-the-air computation, a hybrid channel estimation scheme is proposed, where reciprocity-based and feedback-based channel estimation are combined. In particular, the impact of quantized phase-feedback is studied while the amplitude is assumed estimated exactly. The scheme enables selecting the estimation precision of amplitude and phase separately, depending on the importance of each. Two variants of the scheme are proposed: As shown through simulations and theory, the second variant with reciprocity-based estimation of the channel phase, and optimal quantization of phase feedback, can outperform the first variant estimating the phase by feedback only.

Title: Dynamic Tactile Sensing System and Soft Actor Critic Reinforcement Learning for Inclusion Characterization
Authors: John Bannan, Nazia Rahman, Chang-Hee Won
Abstract: This paper presents the Dynamic Tactile Sensing System that utilizes robotic tactile sensing in conjunction with reinforcement learning to locate and characterize embedded inclusions. A dual arm robot is integrated with an optical Tactile Imaging Sensor that utilizes the Soft Actor Critic Algorithm to acquire tactile data based on a pixel intensity reward. A Dynamic Interrogation procedure for tactile exploration is developed that enables the robot to first localize inclusion and refine their positions for precise imaging. Experimental validation conducted on Polydimethylsiloxane phantoms demonstrates that the robot using the Tactile Soft Actor Critic Model was able to achieve size estimation errors of 2.61% and 5.29% for soft and hard inclusions compared to 7.84% and 6.87% for expert human operators. Results also show that Dynamic Tactile Sensing System was able to locate embedded inclusions and autonomously determine their mechanical properties, useful in applications such as breast tumor characterization.

Title: Phi-SegNet: Phase-Integrated Supervision for Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Shams Nafisa Ali, Taufiq Hasan
Abstract: Deep learning has substantially advanced medical image segmentation, yet achieving robust generalization across diverse imaging modalities and anatomical structures remains a major challenge. A key contributor to this limitation lies in how existing architectures, ranging from CNNs to Transformers and their hybrids, primarily encode spatial information while overlooking frequency-domain representations that capture rich structural and textural cues. Although few recent studies have begun exploring spectral information at the feature level, supervision-level integration of frequency cues-crucial for fine-grained object localization-remains largely untapped. To this end, we propose Phi-SegNet, a CNN-based architecture that incorporates phase-aware information at both architectural and optimization levels. The network integrates Bi-Feature Mask Former (BFMF) modules that blend neighboring encoder features to reduce semantic gaps, and Reverse Fourier Attention (RFA) blocks that refine decoder outputs using phase-regularized features. A dedicated phase-aware loss aligns these features with structural priors, forming a closed feedback loop that emphasizes boundary precision. Evaluated on five public datasets spanning X-ray, US, histopathology, MRI, and colonoscopy, Phi-SegNet consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance, with an average relative improvement of 1.54+/-1.26% in IoU and 0.98+/-0.71% in F1-score over the next best-performing model. In cross-dataset generalization scenarios involving unseen datasets from the known domain, Phi-SegNet also exhibits robust and superior performance, highlighting its adaptability and modality-agnostic design. These findings demonstrate the potential of leveraging spectral priors in both feature representation and supervision, paving the way for generalized segmentation frameworks that excel in fine-grained object localization.

Title: Loose coupling of spectral and spatial models for multi-channel diarization and enhancement of meetings in dynamic environments
Authors: Adrian Meise, Tobias Cord-Landwehr, Christoph Boeddeker, Marc Delcroix, Tomohiro Nakatani, Reinhold Haeb-Umbach
Abstract: Sound capture by microphone arrays opens the possibility to exploit spatial, in addition to spectral, information for diarization and signal enhancement, two important tasks in meeting transcription. However, there is no one-to-one mapping of positions in space to speakers if speakers move. Here, we address this by proposing a novel joint spatial and spectral mixture model, whose two submodels are loosely coupled by modeling the relationship between speaker and position index probabilistically. Thus, spatial and spectral information can be jointly exploited, while at the same time allowing for speakers speaking from different positions. Experiments on the LibriCSS data set with simulated speaker position changes show great improvements over tightly coupled subsystems.

Title: Interconnection-based Model Reduction for Linear Hybrid Systems
Authors: Zirui Niu, Giordano Scarciotti, Alessandro Astolfi
Abstract: In this paper, we address the model reduction problem for linear hybrid systems via the interconnection-based technique called moment matching. We consider two classical interconnections, namely the direct and swapped interconnections, in the hybrid setting, and we present families of reduced-order models for each interconnection via a hybrid characterisation of the steady-state responses. By combining the results for each interconnection, the design of a reduced-order model that achieves moment matching simultaneously for both interconnections is studied. In addition, we show that the presented results have simplified counterparts when the jumps of the hybrid system are periodic. A numerical simulation is finally given to illustrate the results.

Title: Stochastic Control Barrier Functions under State Estimation: From Euclidean Space to Lie Groups
Authors: Ruoyu Lin, Magnus Egerstedt
Abstract: Ensuring safety for autonomous systems under uncertainty remains challenging, particularly when safety of the true state is required despite the true state not being fully known. Control barrier functions (CBFs) have become widely adopted as safety filters. However, standard CBF formulations do not explicitly account for state estimation uncertainty and its propagation, especially for stochastic systems evolving on manifolds. In this paper, we propose a safety-critical control framework with a provable bound on the finite-time safety probability for stochastic systems under noisy state information. The proposed framework explicitly incorporates the uncertainty arising from both process and measurement noise, and synthesizes controllers that adapt to the level of uncertainty. The framework admits closed-form solutions in linear settings, and experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness on systems whose state spaces range from Euclidean space to Lie groups.

Title: Preparation and Motion Study of Magnetically Driven Micro Soft Robot Mimicking the Cownose Ray
Authors: Jiaqing Chang, Song Gao, Chaowei Dong, zhaobang Li, Yang Liu
Abstract: In narrow, unstructured underwater environments such as environmental monitoring and minimally invasive medical procedures, micro soft robots exhibit unique advantages due to their flexible movement capabilities and small size. At the same time, applying bionic technology to the structural design of micro soft robots can significantly improve their swimming performance. However, limited by their miniaturization, these robots are difficult to power internally and usually adopt a wireless power supply method. This study designs and fabricates a magnetically responsive, cownose ray-inspired micro soft robot based on the swimming principle of the cownose ray. The robot is made of a certain proportion of NdFeB and PDMS. Then, a three-dimensional Helmholtz coil is used to generate an oscillating harmonic magnetic field to conduct swimming experiments on the robot, exploring the influence of magnetic field parameters on the robot's swimming performance. The experimental results show that the swimming speed is the fastest at B = 5 mT and f = 11 Hz, reaching 5.25 mm/s, which is about 0.5 body lengths per second. In addition, by adjusting the current direction and frequency of the coil, the robot can perform different swimming modes such as straight swimming, turning swimming, and directional swimming. By employing a stepwise adjustment method, the impact of response errors on the robot's trajectory can be effectively reduced. This study demonstrates a method for magnetically driven micro soft robots, laying a foundation for the application of wireless-driven robots in underwater narrow spaces.

Title: DeepASMR: LLM-Based Zero-Shot ASMR Speech Generation for Anyone of Any Voice
Authors: Leying Zhang, Tingxiao Zhou, Haiyang Sun, Mengxiao Bi, Yanmin Qian
Abstract: While modern Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems achieve high fidelity for read-style speech, they struggle to generate Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR), a specialized, low-intensity speech style essential for relaxation. The inherent challenges include ASMR's subtle, often unvoiced characteristics and the demand for zero-shot speaker adaptation. In this paper, we introduce DeepASMR, the first framework designed for zero-shot ASMR generation. We demonstrate that a single short snippet of a speaker's ordinary, read-style speech is sufficient to synthesize high-fidelity ASMR in their voice, eliminating the need for whispered training data from the target speaker. Methodologically, we first identify that discrete speech tokens provide a soft factorization of ASMR style from speaker timbre. Leveraging this insight, we propose a two-stage pipeline incorporating a Large Language Model (LLM) for content-style encoding and a flow-matching acoustic decoder for timbre reconstruction. Furthermore, we contribute DeepASMR-DB, a comprehensive 670-hour English-Chinese multi-speaker ASMR speech corpus, and introduce a novel evaluation protocol integrating objective metrics, human listening tests, LLM-based scoring and unvoiced speech analysis. Extensive experiments confirm that DeepASMR achieves state-of-the-art naturalness and style fidelity in ASMR generation for anyone of any voice, while maintaining competitive performance on normal speech synthesis.

Title: Neural Nonlinear Shrinkage of Covariance Matrices for Minimum Variance Portfolio Optimization
Authors: Liusha Yang, Siqi Zhao, Shuqi Chai
Abstract: This paper introduces a neural network-based nonlinear shrinkage estimator of covariance matrices for the purpose of minimum variance portfolio optimization. It is a hybrid approach that integrates statistical estimation with machine learning. Starting from the Ledoit-Wolf (LW) shrinkage estimator, we decompose the LW covariance matrix into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and apply a lightweight transformer-based neural network to learn a nonlinear eigenvalue shrinkage function. Trained with portfolio risk as the loss function, the resulting precision matrix (the inverse covariance matrix) estimator directly targets portfolio risk minimization. By conditioning on the sample-to-dimension ratio, the approach remains scalable across different sample sizes and asset universes. Empirical results on stock daily returns from Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P500) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves lower out-of-sample realized risk than benchmark approaches. This highlights the promise of integrating structural statistical models with data-driven learning.

Authors: Hangrui Hu, Xinfa Zhu, Ting He, Dake Guo, Bin Zhang, Xiong Wang, Zhifang Guo, Ziyue Jiang, Hongkun Hao, Zishan Guo, Xinyu Zhang, Pei Zhang, Baosong Yang, Jin Xu, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin
Abstract: In this report, we present the Qwen3-TTS series, a family of advanced multilingual, controllable, robust, and streaming text-to-speech models. Qwen3-TTS supports state-of-the-art 3-second voice cloning and description-based control, allowing both the creation of entirely novel voices and fine-grained manipulation over the output speech. Trained on over 5 million hours of speech data spanning 10 languages, Qwen3-TTS adopts a dual-track LM architecture for real-time synthesis, coupled with two speech tokenizers: 1) Qwen-TTS-Tokenizer-25Hz is a single-codebook codec emphasizing semantic content, which offers seamlessly integration with Qwen-Audio and enables streaming waveform reconstruction via a block-wise DiT. 2) Qwen-TTS-Tokenizer-12Hz achieves extreme bitrate reduction and ultra-low-latency streaming, enabling immediate first-packet emission ($97\,\mathrm{ms}$) through its 12.5 Hz, 16-layer multi-codebook design and a lightweight causal ConvNet. Extensive experiments indicate state-of-the-art performance across diverse objective and subjective benchmark (e.g., TTS multilingual test set, InstructTTSEval, and our long speech test set). To facilitate community research and development, we release both tokenizers and models under the Apache 2.0 license.

Title: Bridging the Perception Gap: A Lightweight Coarse-to-Fine Architecture for Edge Audio Systems
Authors: Hengfan Zhang, Yueqian Lin, Hai Helen Li, Yiran Chen
Abstract: Deploying Audio-Language Models (Audio-LLMs) on edge infrastructure exposes a persistent tension between perception depth and computational efficiency. Lightweight local models tend to produce passive perception - generic summaries that miss the subtle evidence required for multi-step audio reasoning - while indiscriminate cloud offloading incurs unacceptable latency, bandwidth cost, and privacy risk. We propose CoFi-Agent (Tool-Augmented Coarse-to-Fine Agent), a hybrid architecture targeting edge servers and gateways. It performs fast local perception and triggers conditional forensic refinement only when uncertainty is detected. CoFi-Agent runs an initial single-pass on a local 7B Audio-LLM, then a cloud controller gates difficult cases and issues lightweight plans for on-device tools such as temporal re-listening and local ASR. On the MMAR benchmark, CoFi-Agent improves accuracy from 27.20% to 53.60%, while achieving a better accuracy-efficiency trade-off than an always-on investigation pipeline. Overall, CoFi-Agent bridges the perception gap via tool-enabled, conditional edge-cloud collaboration under practical system constraints.

Title: DualShield: Safe Model Predictive Diffusion via Reachability Analysis for Interactive Autonomous Driving
Authors: Rui Yang, Lei Zheng, Ruoyu Yao, Jun Ma
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful approach for multimodal motion planning in autonomous driving. However, their practical deployment is typically hindered by the inherent difficulty in enforcing vehicle dynamics and a critical reliance on accurate predictions of other agents, making them prone to safety issues under uncertain interactions. To address these limitations, we introduce DualShield, a planning and control framework that leverages Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability value functions in a dual capacity. First, the value functions act as proactive guidance, steering the diffusion denoising process towards safe and dynamically feasible regions. Second, they form a reactive safety shield using control barrier-value functions (CBVFs) to modify the executed actions and ensure safety. This dual mechanism preserves the rich exploration capabilities of diffusion models while providing principled safety assurance under uncertain and even adversarial interactions. Simulations in challenging unprotected U-turn scenarios demonstrate that DualShield significantly improves both safety and task efficiency compared to leading methods from different planning paradigms under uncertainty.

Title: PF-D2M: A Pose-free Diffusion Model for Universal Dance-to-Music Generation
Authors: Jaekwon Im, Natalia Polouliakh, Taketo Akama
Abstract: Dance-to-music generation aims to generate music that is aligned with dance movements. Existing approaches typically rely on body motion features extracted from a single human dancer and limited dance-to-music datasets, which restrict their performance and applicability to real-world scenarios involving multiple dancers and non-human dancers. In this paper, we propose PF-D2M, a universal diffusion-based dance-to-music generation model that incorporates visual features extracted from dance videos. PF-D2M is trained with a progressive training strategy that effectively addresses data scarcity and generalization challenges. Both objective and subjective evaluations show that PF-D2M achieves state-of-the-art performance in dance-music alignment and music quality.

Title: Time-Optimal Switching Surfaces for Triple Integrator under Full Box Constraints
Authors: Yunan Wang, Chuxiong Hu, Zhao Jin
Abstract: Time-optimal control for triple integrator under full box constraints is a fundamental problem in the field of optimal control, which has been widely applied in the industry. However, scenarios involving asymmetric constraints, non-stationary boundary conditions, and active position constraints pose significant challenges. This paper provides a complete characterization of time-optimal switching surfaces for the problem, leading to novel insights into the geometric and algebraic structure of the optimal control. The active condition of position constraints is derived, which is absent from the literature. An efficient algorithm is proposed, capable of planning time-optimal trajectories under asymmetric full constraints and arbitrary boundary states, with a 100% success rate. Computational time for each trajectory is within approximately 10{\mu}s, achieving a 5-order-of-magnitude reduction compared to optimization-based baselines.

Title: Improve the autonomy of the SE2(3) group based Extended Kalman Filter for Integrated Navigation: Theoretical Analysis
Authors: Jiarui Cui, Maosong Wang, Wenqi Wu, Peiqi Li, Xianfei Pan
Abstract: One of core advantages of the SE2(3) Lie group framework for navigation modeling lies in the autonomy of error propagation. Current research on Lie group based extended Kalman filters has demonstrated that error propagation autonomy holds in low-precision applications, such as in micro electromechanical system (MEMS) based integrated navigation without considering earth rotation and inertial device biases. However, in high-precision navigation state estimation, maintaining autonomy is extremely difficult when considering with earth rotation and inertial device biases. This paper presents the theoretical analysis on the autonomy of SE2(3) group based high-precision navigation models under inertial, earth and world frame respectively. Through theoretical analysis, we find that the limitation of the traditional, trivial SE2(3) group navigation modeling method is that the presence of Coriolis force terms introduced by velocity in non-inertial frame. Therefore, a construction method for SE2(3) group navigation models is proposed, which brings the navigation models closer to full autonomy.

In the previous paper, the theoretical analysis of autonomy property of navigation model in inertial, earth and world frames was given. A construction method for SE2(3) group navigation model is proposed to improve the non-inertial navigation model toward full autonomy. This paper serves as a counterpart to previous paper and conducts the real-world strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS)/odometer(ODO) experiments as well as Monte-Carlo simulations to demonstrate the performance of improved SE2(3) group based high-precision navigation models.

Title: Average Unfairness in Routing Games
Authors: Pan-Yang Su, Arwa Alanqary, Bryce L. Ferguson, Manxi Wu, Alexandre M. Bayen, Shankar Sastry
Abstract: We propose average unfairness as a new measure of fairness in routing games, defined as the ratio between the average latency and the minimum latency experienced by users. This measure is a natural complement to two existing unfairness notions: loaded unfairness, which compares maximum and minimum latencies of routes with positive flow, and user equilibrium (UE) unfairness, which compares maximum latency with the latency of a Nash equilibrium. We show that the worst-case values of all three unfairness measures coincide and are characterized by a steepness parameter intrinsic to the latency function class. We show that average unfairness is always no greater than loaded unfairness, and the two measures are equal only when the flow is fully fair. Besides that, we offer a complete comparison of the three unfairness measures, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first theoretical analysis in this direction. Finally, we study the constrained system optimum (CSO) problem, where one seeks to minimize total latency subject to an upper bound on unfairness. We prove that, for the same tolerance level, the optimal flow under an average unfairness constraint achieves lower total latency than any flow satisfying a loaded unfairness constraint. We show that such improvement is always strict in parallel-link networks and establish sufficient conditions for general networks. We further illustrate the latter with numerical examples. Our results provide theoretical guarantees and valuable insights for evaluating fairness-efficiency tradeoffs in network routing.

Title: Robust Output Tracking for Induced Seismicity Mitigation in Underground Reservoirs Governed by a Nonlinear 3D PDE-ODE System
Authors: Diego Gutiérrez-Oribio, Ioannis Stefanou
Abstract: This paper presents a robust output-feedback controller for induced seismicity mitigation in geological reservoirs described by a coupled 3D PDE-ODE model. The controller is a MIMO Super-Twisting design, producing a continuous control signal and requiring minimal model information, while accommodating parameter uncertainty and spatial heterogeneity. Two operational outputs are regulated simultaneously: regional pressures and seismicity rates computed over reservoir sub-regions. Closed-loop properties are established via explicit bounds on the solution and its time derivative for both the infinite-dimensional dynamics and the nonlinear ODE system, yielding finite-time or exponential convergence of the tracking errors. The method is evaluated on a Groningen gas-field case study in two scenarios: gas production while not exceeding the intrinsic seismicity of the region, and combined production with CO$_2$ injection toward net-zero operation. Simulations demonstrate accurate tracking of pressure and seismicity targets across regions under significant parameter uncertainty, supporting safer reservoir operation without sacrificing production objectives.

Title: Diversity Analysis for Terahertz Communication Systems under Small-Scale Fading
Authors: Almutasem Bellah Enad, Jihad Fahs, Hakim Jemaa, Hadi Sarieddeen, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri
Abstract: The terahertz (THz) band is a key enabler for future wireless systems, promising ultra-high data rates and dense spatial reuse. However, the reliability of THz links remains a major challenge due to severe path loss and small-scale fading effects, particularly in dynamic indoor and outdoor environments. This paper presents a comprehensive diversity analysis framework for THz communication systems under small-scale fading conditions. We model fading statistically using the generalized $\alpha$-$\mu$ distribution for indoor scenarios and the mixture of gamma (MG) model for outdoor propagation. We complement previous works that analyzed diversity under the $\alpha$-$\mu$ channels [1],[2]. In particular, we present new insights on diversity for the MG channel in addition to recovering the results of [2] using a different approach. Moreover, we derive asymptotic expressions for the bit error rate as a function of the inverse signal-to-noise ratio, recovering all of the $\alpha$-$\mu$ diversity results using a simpler approximation method. The analytical results are extensively validated through Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating excellent agreement. Our findings show that diversity gains in THz systems are strongly influenced by the number of independent paths, the severity of fading, and frequency selectivity. The proposed framework provides system designers with clear guidelines for quantifying and optimizing diversity gains in emerging channel models, paving the way for more reliable high-frequency wireless links in next-generation networks.

Title: Out-of-Band Modality Synergy Based Multi-User Beam Prediction and Proactive BS Selection with Zero Pilot Overhead
Authors: Kehui Li, Binggui Zhou, Jiajia Guo, Feifei Gao, Guanghua Yang, Shaodan Ma
Abstract: Multi-user millimeter-wave communication relies on narrow beams and dense cell deployments to ensure reliable connectivity. However, tracking optimal beams for multiple mobile users across multiple base stations (BSs) results in significant signaling overhead. Recent works have explored the capability of out-of-band (OOB) modalities in obtaining spatial characteristics of wireless channels and reducing pilot overhead in single-BS single-user/multi-user systems. However, applying OOB modalities for multi-BS selection towards dense cell deployments leads to high coordination overhead, i.e, excessive computing overhead and high latency in data exchange. How to leverage OOB modalities to eliminate pilot overhead and achieve efficient multi-BS coordination in multi-BS systems remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel OOB modality synergy (OMS) based mobility management scheme to realize multi-user beam prediction and proactive BS selection by synergizing two OOB modalities, i.e., vision and location. Specifically, mobile users are initially identified via spatial alignment of visual sensing and location feedback, and then tracked according to the temporal correlation in image sequence. Subsequently, a binary encoding map based gain and beam prediction network (BEM-GBPN) is designed to predict beamforming gains and optimal beams for mobile users at each BS, such that a central unit can control the BSs to perform user handoff and beam switching. Simulation results indicate that the proposed OMS-based mobility management scheme enhances beam prediction and BS selection accuracy and enables users to achieve 91% transmission rates of the optimal with zero pilot overhead and significantly improve multi-BS coordination efficiency compared to existing methods.

Title: VHU-Net: Variational Hadamard U-Net for Body MRI Bias Field Correction
Authors: Xin Zhu, Ahmet Enis Cetin, Gorkem Durak, Batuhan Gundogdu, Ziliang Hong, Hongyi Pan, Ertugrul Aktas, Elif Keles, Hatice Savas, Aytekin Oto, Hiten Patel, Adam B. Murphy, Ashley Ross, Frank Miller, Baris Turkbey, Ulas Bagci
Abstract: Bias field artifacts in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans introduce spatially smooth intensity inhomogeneities that degrade image quality and hinder downstream analysis. To address this challenge, we propose a novel variational Hadamard U-Net (VHU-Net) for effective body MRI bias field correction. The encoder comprises multiple convolutional Hadamard transform blocks (ConvHTBlocks), each integrating convolutional layers with a Hadamard transform (HT) layer. Specifically, the HT layer performs channel-wise frequency decomposition to isolate low-frequency components, while a subsequent scaling layer and semi-soft thresholding mechanism suppress redundant high-frequency noise. To compensate for the HT layer's inability to model inter-channel dependencies, the decoder incorporates an inverse HT-reconstructed transformer block, enabling global, frequency-aware attention for the recovery of spatially consistent bias fields. The stacked decoder ConvHTBlocks further enhance the capacity to reconstruct the underlying ground-truth bias field. Building on the principles of variational inference, we formulate a new evidence lower bound (ELBO) as the training objective, promoting sparsity in the latent space while ensuring accurate bias field estimation. Comprehensive experiments on body MRI datasets demonstrate the superiority of VHU-Net over existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of intensity uniformity. Moreover, the corrected images yield substantial downstream improvements in segmentation accuracy. Our framework offers computational efficiency, interpretability, and robust performance across multi-center datasets, making it suitable for clinical deployment.

Title: Distance-Domain Degrees of Freedom in Near-Field Region
Authors: Son T. Duong, Tho Le-Ngoc
Abstract: Extremely large aperture arrays operating in the near-field regime unlock additional spatial resources, which can be exploited to simultaneously serve multiple users even when they share the same angular direction. This work investigates the distance-domain degrees of freedom (DoF), defined as the DoF when a user varies only its distance to the base station and not the angle. To obtain the distance-domain DoF, we study a line-of-sight (LoS) channel with a source representing a base station and an observation region representing users, where the source is a large two-dimensional transmit (Tx) array with arbitrary shape and the observation region is an arbitrarily long linear receive (Rx) array with collinearly aligned elements located at different distances from the Tx array. We assume that both the Tx and Rx arrays have continuous apertures with an infinite number of elements and infinitesimal spacing, which establishes an upper bound for the distance-domain DoF in the case of a finite number of elements. First, we analyze an ideal case where the Tx array is a single piece and the Rx array is on the broadside of the Tx array. By reformulating the channel as an integral operator with a Hermitian convolution kernel, we derive a closed-form expression for the distance-domain DoF via the Fourier transform. Our analysis shows that the distance-domain DoF is predominantly determined by the extreme boundaries of both the Tx and Rx arrays rather than their detailed interior structure. We further extend the framework to non-broadside configurations by employing a projection method that converts the problem to an equivalent broadside case. Finally, we extend the analytical framework to modular arrays and show the distance-domain DoF gain over a single-piece array under a fixed total physical length.

Title: Secure Energy Efficient Wireless Transmission: A Finite v/s Infinite-Horizon RL Solution
Authors: Shalini Tripathi, Ankur Bansal, Holger Claussen, Lester Ho, Chinmoy Kundu
Abstract: In this paper, a joint optimal allocation of transmit power at the source and jamming power at the destination is proposed to maximize the average secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) of a wireless network within a finite time duration. The destination transmits the jamming signal to improve secrecy by utilizing full-duplex capability. The source and destination both have energy harvesting (EH) capability with limited battery capacity. Due to the Markov nature of the system, the problem is formulated as a finite-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) problem. We propose the finite-horizon joint power allocation (FHJPA) algorithm for the finite-horizon RL problem and compare it with a low-complexity greedy algorithm (GA). An infinite-horizon joint power allocation (IHJPA) algorithm is also proposed for the corresponding infinite-horizon problem. A comparative analysis of these algorithms is carried out in terms of SEE, expected total transmitted secure bits, and computational complexity. The results show that the FHJPA algorithm outperforms the GA and IHJPA algorithms due to its appropriate modelling in finite horizon transmission. When the source node battery has sufficient energy, the GA can yield performance close to the FHJPA algorithm despite its low-complexity. When the transmission time horizon increases, the accuracy of the infinite-horizon model improves, resulting in a reduced performance gap between FHJPA and IHJPA algorithms. The computational time comparison shows that the FHJPA algorithm takes $16.6$ percent less time than the IHJPA algorithm.

Title: MOSA: Mixture of Simple Adapters Outperforms Monolithic Approaches in LLM-based Multilingual ASR
Authors: Junjie Li, Jing Peng, Yangui Fang, Shuai Wang, Kai Yu
Abstract: LLM-based ASR overcomes multilingual data scarcity by projecting speech representations into the LLM space to leverage its robust semantic and reasoning capabilities. However, while previous approaches typically enhance performance by scaling data or model parameters, a single projector often struggles to effectively align representations across different languages. In this work, we propose an MoE-based projector named MOSA (Mixture of Simple Adapters). By aggregating multiple simple adapters, this architecture enables different experts to specialize in learning either language-shared or language-specific knowledge. This approach not only mitigates parameter interference between languages but also facilitates positive transfer from high-resource to low-resource languages, effectively alleviating data scarcity issues. Experimental results demonstrate that MOSA-Base achieves a 15.4% relative reduction in average WER compared to the Ideal-LLM Base, consistently outperforming it across all languages. Notably, MOSA achieves a 13.3% WER reduction over the Ideal-LLM Base while utilizing only 60% of its parameters. These findings highlight MOSA's superior parameter efficiency and robustness against data imbalance, suggesting that a mixture of simple adapters is more suitable for multilingual LLM-based ASR than complex single-adapter designs.

Title: Attentive AV-FusionNet: Audio-Visual Quality Prediction with Hybrid Attention
Authors: Ina Salaj, Arijit Biswas
Abstract: We introduce a novel deep learning-based audio-visual quality (AVQ) prediction model that leverages internal features from state-of-the-art unimodal predictors. Unlike prior approaches that rely on simple fusion strategies, our model employs a hybrid representation that combines learned Generative Machine Listener (GML) audio features with hand-crafted Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion (VMAF) video features. Attention mechanisms capture cross-modal interactions and intra-modal relationships, yielding context-aware quality representations. A modality relevance estimator quantifies each modality's contribution per content, potentially enabling adaptive bitrate allocation. Experiments demonstrate improved AVQ prediction accuracy and robustness across diverse content types.

Title: Towards Evaluating Generative Audio: Insights from Neural Audio Codec Embedding Distances
Authors: Arijit Biswas, Lars Villemoes
Abstract: Neural audio codecs (NACs) achieve low-bitrate compression by learning compact audio representations, which can also serve as features for perceptual quality evaluation. We introduce DACe, an enhanced, higher-fidelity version of the Descript Audio Codec (DAC), trained on diverse real and synthetic tonal data with balanced sampling. We systematically compare Fréchet Audio Distance (FAD) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) on MUSHRA tests across speech, music, and mixed content. FAD consistently outperforms MMD, and embeddings from higher-fidelity NACs (such as DACe) show stronger correlations with human judgments. While CLAP LAION Music (CLAP-M) and OpenL3 Mel128 (OpenL3-128M) embeddings achieve higher correlations, NAC embeddings provide a practical zero-shot approach to audio quality assessment, requiring only unencoded audio for training. These results demonstrate the dual utility of NACs for compression and perceptually informed audio evaluation.

Title: An Efficient Quality Metric for Video Frame Interpolation Based on Motion-Field Divergence
Authors: Conall Daly, Darren Ramsook, Anil Kokaram
Abstract: Video frame interpolation is a fundamental tool for temporal video enhancement, but existing quality metrics struggle to evaluate the perceptual impact of interpolation artefacts effectively. Metrics like PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS ignore temporal coherence. State-of-the-art quality metrics tailored towards video frame interpolation, like FloLPIPS, have been developed but suffer from computational inefficiency that limits their practical application. We present $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$, a novel full-reference quality metric that enhances PSNR through motion divergence weighting, a technique adapted from archival film restoration where it was developed to detect temporal inconsistencies. Our approach highlights singularities in motion fields which is then used to weight image errors. Evaluation on the BVI-VFI dataset (180 sequences across multiple frame rates, resolutions and interpolation methods) shows $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$ achieves statistically significant improvements: +0.09 Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient over FloLPIPS, while being 2.5$\times$ faster and using 4$\times$ less memory. Performance remains consistent across all content categories and are robust to the motion estimator used. The efficiency and accuracy of $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$ enables fast quality evaluation and practical use as a loss function for training neural networks for video frame interpolation tasks. An implementation of our metric is available at this http URL.

Title: AQA-TTRL: Self-Adaptation in Audio Question Answering with Test-Time Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Haoyu Zhang, Jiaxian Guo, Yusuke Iwasawa, Yutaka Matsuo
Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) demonstrate impressive general audio understanding, but once deployed, they are static and fail to improve with new real-world audio data. As traditional supervised fine-tuning is costly, we introduce a novel framework for test-time audio understanding, AQA-TTRL, where an LALM evolves on-the-fly using only unlabeled test data. It first generates pseudo-labels from the prediction via majority voting, then optimizes the model via reinforcement learning. To handle the inherent noise in these self-generated labels, we introduce a confidence-based weighting method to adjust training signals. Furthermore, a multiple-attempt sampling operation mitigates advantage collapse and stabilizes training. On the MMAU (test-mini/test), MMAR, and MMSU benchmarks, AQA-TTRL achieves significant average improvements of 4.42% for the Qwen2.5-Omni 7B model and 11.04% for the 3B model. Notably, the adapted 3B model consistently outperforms the direct inference of the unadapted 7B model, highlighting the effectiveness of previously unexplored test-time adaptations in audio understanding.

Title: Quantization-Based Score Calibration for Few-Shot Keyword Spotting with Dynamic Time Warping in Noisy Environments
Authors: Kevin Wilkinghoff, Alessia Cornaggia-Urrigshardt, Zheng-Hua Tan
Abstract: Detecting occurrences of keywords with keyword spotting (KWS) systems requires thresholding continuous detection scores. Selecting appropriate thresholds is a non-trivial task, typically relying on optimizing performance on a validation dataset. However, such greedy threshold selection often leads to suboptimal performance on unseen data, particularly in varying or noisy acoustic environments or few-shot settings. In this work, we investigate detection threshold estimation for template-based open-set few-shot KWS using dynamic time warping on noisy speech data. To mitigate the performance degradation caused by suboptimal thresholds, we propose a score calibration approach that operates at the embedding level by quantizing learned representations and applying quantization error-based normalization prior to DTW-based scoring and thresholding. Experiments on KWS-DailyTalk with simulated high frequency radio channels show that the proposed calibration approach simplifies the selection of robust detection thresholds and significantly improves the resulting performance.

Title: Wideband Antenna Deconvolution for Bistatic Millimeter Wave Radar Reflectivity Measurements
Authors: Carsten Andrich, Isabella Varga, Tobias F. Nowack, Alexander Ihlow, Sebastian Giehl, Michael Schubert, Reiner S. Thomä, Matthias A. Hein
Abstract: Bistatic radar measurements offer unique spatial diversity and enhanced target characterization capabilities, rendering them increasingly vital for contemporary sensing application research. The reliability of such measurements is contingent upon precise system and antenna calibration. The prevailing technique is the substitution method, which involves the use of known reference objects. We propose an over-the-air calibration algorithm for spherical bistatic measurement systems. Our method is both significantly simpler and twice as fast as existing algorithms. The application of our technique to reflectivity measurements of a metal sphere from 76 to 81 GHz demonstrates a dynamic range enhancement of up to 40 dB when compared with uncalibrated data. A comparison with simulation data demonstrates a high degree of agreement between measurement and simulation.

Title: Data-Enabled Predictive Control and Guidance for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles
Authors: Sebastian Zieglmeier, Mathias Hudoba de Badyn, Narada D. Warakagoda, Thomas R. Krogstad, Paal Engelstad
Abstract: This paper presents a fully data-driven control framework for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) based on Data-Enabled Predictive Control (DeePC). The approach eliminates the need for explicit hydrodynamic modeling by exploiting measured input-output data to predict and optimize future system behavior. Classic DeePC was employed in the heading control, while a cascaded DeePC architecture is proposed for depth regulation. For 3-D waypoint path following, the Adaptive Line-of-Sight algorithm is extended to a predictive formulation and integrated with DeePC. All methods are validated in extensive simulation on the REMUS~100 AUV and compared with classical PI/PID control. The results demonstrate superior tracking performance and robustness of DeePC under ocean-current disturbances and nonlinear operating conditions, while significantly reducing modeling effort.

Title: Analyzing the Impact of Demand Response on Short-Circuit Current via a Unit Commitment Model
Authors: Peng Wang, Zhengmao Li, Luis Badesa
Abstract: In low-carbon grids, system flexibility can be enhanced through mechanisms such as Demand Response (DR), enabling the efficient utilization of renewable energy. However, as Synchronous Generators (SGs) are being replaced by renewable energy sources characterized by Inverter-Based Resources (IBR), system stability is severely affected. Due to the limited overload capability of IBRs, their Short-Circuit Current (SCC) contribution is much smaller than that of SGs. As a result, protection devices may fail to trip during faults. Consequently, the remaining SGs play a key role in providing sufficient SCC. Since the commitment of SGs is closely related to system loading conditions, DR can indirectly affect their SCC provision, a relationship that has not yet been investigated in the literature. Therefore, this paper incorporates both DR and SCC constraints into a unit commitment problem and conducts case studies on an IEEE 30-bus system. The results show that although DR can reduce total costs by adjusting power demand, it may also lead to inadequate SCC levels. Nevertheless, when flexible loads are properly coordinated with SCC requirements, the total cost increases by only 0.3%, which is significantly lower than the cost of system dispatch without DR. This demonstrates that DR can facilitate stable system operation in a cost-effective manner.

Title: Principled Coarse-Grained Acceptance for Speculative Decoding in Speech
Authors: Moran Yanuka, Paul Dixon, Eyal Finkelshtein, Daniel Rotman, Raja Giryes
Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates autoregressive speech generation by letting a fast draft model propose tokens that a larger target model verifies. However, for speech LLMs that generate acoustic tokens, exact token matching is overly restrictive: many discrete tokens are acoustically or semantically interchangeable, reducing acceptance rates and limiting speedups. We introduce Principled Coarse-Graining (PCG), which verifies proposals at the level of Acoustic Similarity Groups (ASGs) derived from the target model's embedding space. By splitting each token's probability mass across the overlapping groups that contain it, we define an overlap-aware coarse-grained distribution and perform rejection sampling on the resulting group variable. This yields an exactness guarantee at the group level while allowing the accepted draft token to stand in for any member of the group in practice. On LibriTTS, PCG increases acceptance and throughput relative to standard speculative decoding and prior speech-specific relaxations while maintaining intelligibility and speaker similarity. These results suggest acoustically aware, group-level acceptance as a simple and general way to accelerate speech token generation while maintaining speech quality.

Title: On the Performance of Dual-Antenna Repeater Assisted Bi-Static MIMO ISAC
Authors: Anubhab Chowdhury, Erik G. Larsson
Abstract: This paper presents a framework for target detection and downlink data transmission in a repeater-assisted bi-static integrated sensing and communication system. A repeater is an active scatterer that retransmits incoming signals with a complex gain almost instantaneously, thereby enhancing sensing performance by amplifying the echoes reflected by the targets. The same mechanism can also improve downlink communication by mitigating coverage holes. However, the repeater introduces noise and increases interference at the sensing receiver, while also amplifying the interference from target detection signals at the downlink users. The proposed framework accounts for these sensing-communication trade-offs and demonstrates the potential benefits achievable through a carefully designed precoder at the transmitting base station. In particular, our finding is that a higher value of probability of detection can be attained with considerably lower target radar-cross-section variance by deploying repeaters in the target hot-spot areas.

Title: Integrated Sensing and Communication for Low-Altitude Security
Authors: Ruixing Ren
Abstract: The dense concentration of low-altitude, slow-speed, and small-size targets in the complex low-altitude environment poses significant security challenges, including failures in continuous wide-area sensing and ambiguous target intent, which existing regulatory frameworks struggle to address. Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), a hallmark of next-generation mobile communication, offers a transformative approach to low-altitude security governance. By leveraging existing cellular infrastructure and spectrum resources, ISAC enables the construction of a seamless wide-area sensing network, supports intelligent feature extraction and intent inference, facilitates real-time collaborative decision-making, and establishes a dynamic trust authentication framework. This article systematically reviews the technical system, analyzes the security challenges, forecasts the enabling value of ISAC, and discusses the resulting open problems and challenges, thereby laying a foundation for future research and industrial implementation.

Title: An Ion-Intercalation Memristor for Enabling Full Parallel Writing in Crossbar Networks
Authors: Tingwei Zhang, Jiahui Liu, David Allstot, Huaping Liu
Abstract: Crossbar architectures have long been seen as a promising foundation for in-memory computing, using memristor arrays for high-density, energy-efficient analog computation. However, this conventional architecture suffers from a fundamental limitation: the inability to perform parallel write operations due to the sneak path problem. This arises from the structural overlap of read and write paths, forcing sequential or semi-parallel updates and severely limiting scalability. To address this, we introduce a new memristor design that decouples read and write operations at the device level. This design enables orthogonal conductive paths, and employs a reversible ion doping mechanism, inspired by lithium-ion battery principles, to modulate resistance states independently of computation. Fabricated devices exhibit near-ideal memristive characteristics and stable performance under isolated read/write conditions.

Title: Control Occupation Kernel Regression for Nonlinear Control-Affine Systems
Authors: Moad Abudia, Tejasvi Channagiri, Joel A. Rosenfeld, Rushikesh Kamalapurkar
Abstract: This manuscript presents an algorithm for obtaining an approximation of a nonlinear high order control affine dynamical system. Controlled trajectories of the system are leveraged as the central unit of information via embedding them in vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (vvRKHS). The trajectories are embedded as the so-called higher order control occupation kernels which represent an operator on the vvRKHS corresponding to iterated integration after multiplication by a given controller. The solution to the system identification problem is then the unique solution of an infinite dimensional regularized regression problem. The representer theorem is then used to express the solution as finite linear combination of these occupation kernels, which converts an infinite dimensional optimization problem to a finite dimensional optimization problem. The vector valued structure of the Hilbert space allows for simultaneous approximation of the drift and control effectiveness components of the control affine system. Several experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed approach.

Title: Reinforcement Learning Compensated Model Predictive Control for Off-road Driving on Unknown Deformable Terrain
Authors: Prakhar Gupta, Jonathon M. Smereka, Yunyi Jia
Abstract: This study presents an Actor-Critic reinforcement learning Compensated Model Predictive Controller (AC2MPC) designed for high-speed, off-road autonomous driving on deformable terrains. Addressing the difficulty of modeling unknown tire-terrain interaction and ensuring real-time control feasibility and performance, this framework integrates deep reinforcement learning with a model predictive controller to manage unmodeled nonlinear dynamics. We evaluate the controller framework over constant and varying velocity profiles using high-fidelity simulator Project Chrono. Our findings demonstrate that our controller statistically outperforms standalone model-based and learning-based controllers over three unknown terrains that represent sandy deformable track, sandy and rocky track and cohesive clay-like deformable soil track. Despite varied and previously unseen terrain characteristics, this framework generalized well enough to track longitudinal reference speeds with the least error. Furthermore, this framework required significantly less training data compared to purely learning based controller, converging in fewer steps while delivering better performance. Even when under-trained, this controller outperformed the standalone controllers, highlighting its potential for safer and more efficient real-world deployment.

Title: Data-driven tool wear prediction in milling, based on a process-integrated single-sensor approach
Authors: Eric Hirsch, Christian Friedrich
Abstract: Accurate tool wear prediction is essential for maintaining productivity and minimizing costs in machining. However, the complex nature of the tool wear process poses significant challenges to achieving reliable predictions. This study explores data-driven methods, in particular deep learning, for tool wear prediction. Traditional data-driven approaches often focus on a single process, relying on multi-sensor setups and extensive data generation, which limits generalization to new settings. Moreover, multi-sensor integration is often impractical in industrial environments. To address these limitations, this research investigates the transferability of predictive models using minimal training data, validated across two processes. Furthermore, it uses a simple setup with a single acceleration sensor to establish a low-cost data generation approach that facilitates the generalization of models to other processes via transfer learning. The study evaluates several machine learning models, including transformer-inspired convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory networks (LSTM), support vector machines (SVM), and decision trees, trained on different input formats such as feature vectors and short-time Fourier transform (STFT). The performance of the models is evaluated on two machines and on different amounts of training data, including scenarios with significantly reduced datasets, providing insight into their effectiveness under constrained data conditions. The results demonstrate the potential of specific models and configurations for effective tool wear prediction, contributing to the development of more adaptable and efficient predictive maintenance strategies in machining. Notably, the ConvNeXt model has an exceptional performance, achieving 99.1\% accuracy in identifying tool wear using data from only four milling tools operated until they are worn.

Title: Simulating Dual-Pixel Images From Ray Tracing For Depth Estimation
Authors: Fengchen He, Dayang Zhao, Hao Xu, Tingwei Quan, Shaoqun Zeng
Abstract: Many studies utilize dual-pixel (DP) sensor phase characteristics for various applications, such as depth estimation and deblurring. However, since the DP image features are entirely determined by the camera hardware, DP-depth paired datasets are very scarce, especially when performing depth estimation on customized cameras. To overcome this, studies simulate DP images using ideal optical system models. However, these simulations often violate real optical propagation laws, leading to poor generalization to real DP data. To address this, we investigate the domain gap between simulated and real DP data, and propose solutions using the Simulating DP images from ray tracing (Sdirt) scheme. The Sdirt generates realistic DP images via ray tracing and integrates them into the depth estimation training pipeline. Experimental results show that models trained with Sdirt-simulated images generalize better to real DP data. The code and collected datasets will be available at this http URL

Title: Emergence and Evolution of Interpretable Concepts in Diffusion Models
Authors: Berk Tinaz, Zalan Fabian, Mahdi Soltanolkotabi
Abstract: Diffusion models have become the go-to method for text-to-image generation, producing high-quality images from pure noise. However, the inner workings of diffusion models is still largely a mystery due to their black-box nature and complex, multi-step generation process. Mechanistic interpretability techniques, such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), have been successful in understanding and steering the behavior of large language models at scale. However, the great potential of SAEs has not yet been applied toward gaining insight into the intricate generative process of diffusion models. In this work, we leverage the SAE framework to probe the inner workings of a popular text-to-image diffusion model, and uncover a variety of human-interpretable concepts in its activations. Interestingly, we find that even before the first reverse diffusion step is completed, the final composition of the scene can be predicted surprisingly well by looking at the spatial distribution of activated concepts. Moreover, going beyond correlational analysis, we design intervention techniques aimed at manipulating image composition and style, and demonstrate that (1) in early stages of diffusion image composition can be effectively controlled, (2) in the middle stages image composition is finalized, however stylistic interventions are effective, and (3) in the final stages only minor textural details are subject to change.

Title: Configurations, Tessellations and Tone Networks
Authors: Jeffrey R. Boland, Lane P. Hughston
Abstract: The Eulerian tonnetz, which associates three minor chords to each major chord and three major chords to each minor chord, can be represented by a bipartite graph with twelve white vertices denoting major chords and twelve black vertices denoting minor chords. This so-called Levi graph determines a configuration of twelve points and twelve lines in $\mathbb R^2$ with the property that three points lie on each line and three lines pass through each point. Interesting features of the tonnetz, such as the existence of the four hexatonic cycles and the three octatonic cycles, crucial for the understanding of nineteenth-century harmony and voice leading, can be read off directly as properties of this configuration $\{12_3\}$ and its Levi graph. Analogous tone networks together with their Levi graphs and configurations can be constructed for pentatonic music and twelve-tone music. These and other new tonnetze offer the promise of new methods of composition. If the constraints of the Eulerian tonnetz are relaxed so as to allow movements between major and minor triads with variations at exactly two tones, the resulting bipartite graph has two components, each generating a tessellation of the plane, of a type known to Kepler, based on hexagons, squares and dodecagons. When the same combinatorial idea is applied to tetrachords of the 'Tristan' genus (dominant sevenths and half-diminished sevenths) the cycles of the resulting bipartite graph are sufficiently ample in girth to ensure the existence of a second configuration $\{12_3\}$, distinct from the Eulerian tonnetz as an incidence geometry, which can be used for a new approach to the analysis of the rich tetradic harmonies of the nineteenth century common practice.

Title: MMSU: A Massive Multi-task Spoken Language Understanding and Reasoning Benchmark
Authors: Dingdong Wang, Jincenzi Wu, Junan Li, Dongchao Yang, Xueyuan Chen, Tianhua Zhang, Helen Meng
Abstract: Speech inherently contains rich acoustic information that extends far beyond the textual language. In real-world spoken language understanding, effective interpretation often requires integrating semantic meaning (e.g., content), paralinguistic features (e.g., emotions, speed, pitch) and phonological characteristics (e.g., prosody, intonation, rhythm), which are embedded in speech. While recent multimodal Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing audio information, their ability to perform fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural speech remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning in spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated audio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks. To ground our benchmark in linguistic theory, we systematically incorporate a wide range of linguistic phenomena, including phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, syntactics, semantics, and paralinguistics. Through a rigorous evaluation of 14 advanced SpeechLLMs, we identify substantial room for improvement in existing models, highlighting meaningful directions for future optimization. MMSU establishes a new standard for comprehensive assessment of spoken language understanding, providing valuable insights for developing more sophisticated human-AI speech interaction systems. MMSU benchmark is available at this https URL. Evaluation Code is available at this https URL.

Title: Toward Efficient Speech Emotion Recognition via Spectral Learning and Attention
Authors: HyeYoung Lee, Muhammad Nadeem
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) traditionally relies on auditory data analysis for emotion classification. Several studies have adopted different methods for SER. However, existing SER methods often struggle to capture subtle emotional variations and generalize across diverse datasets. In this article, we use Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) as spectral features to bridge the gap between computational emotion processing and human auditory perception. To further improve robustness and feature diversity, we propose a novel 1D-CNN-based SER framework that integrates data augmentation techniques. MFCC features extracted from the augmented data are processed using a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture enhanced with channel and spatial attention mechanisms. These attention modules allow the model to highlight key emotional patterns, enhancing its ability to capture subtle variations in speech signals. The proposed method delivers cutting-edge performance, achieving the accuracy of 97.49% for SAVEE, 99.23% for RAVDESS, 89.31% for CREMA-D, 99.82% for TESS, 99.53% for EMO-DB, and 96.39% for EMOVO. Experimental results show new benchmarks in SER, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in recognizing emotional expressions with high precision. Our evaluation demonstrates that the integration of advanced Deep Learning (DL) methods substantially enhances generalization across diverse datasets, underscoring their potential to advance SER for real-world deployment in assistive technologies and human-computer interaction.

Title: You May Use the Same Channel Knowledge Map for Environment-Aware NLoS Sensing and Communication
Authors: Di Wu, Zhuoyin Dai, Yong Zeng
Abstract: As one of the key usage scenarios for the sixth generation (6G) wireless networks, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) provides an efficient framework to achieve simultaneous wireless sensing and communication. However, traditional wireless sensing techniques mainly rely on the line-of-sight (LoS) assumptions, i.e., the sensing targets are directly visible to both the sensing transmitter and receiver. This hinders ISAC systems to be applied in complex environments such as the urban low-altitude airspace, which usually suffers from signal blockage and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) multi-path propagation. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel approach to enable environment-aware NLoS ISAC by leveraging the new technique called channel knowledge map (CKM), which was originally proposed for environment-aware wireless communications. One major novelty of our proposed method is that the same CKM built for wireless communication can be directly used to enable NLoS wireless sensing, thus enjoying the benefits of ``killing two birds with one stone''. To this end, the sensing targets are treated as virtual user equipment (UE), and the wireless communication channel priors are transformed into the sensing channel priors, allowing one single CKM to serve dual purposes. We illustrate our proposed framework by a specific CKM called \emph{channel angle-delay map} (CADM). Specifically, the proposed framework utilizes CADM to derive angle-delay priors of the sensing channel by exploiting the relationship between communication and sensing angle-delay distributions, enabling sensing target localization in the challenging NLoS environment. Extensive simulation results demonstrate significant performance improvements over classic geometry-based sensing methods, which is further validated by Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) analysis.

Title: Implementing Optimal Taxation: A Constrained Optimization Framework for Tax Reform
Authors: Mark Verhagen, Menno Schellekens, Michael Garstka
Abstract: While optimal taxation theory provides clear prescriptions for tax design, translating these insights into actual tax codes remains difficult. Existing work largely offers theoretical characterizations of optimal systems, while practical implementation methods are scarce. Bridging this gap involves designing tax rules that meet theoretical goals, while accommodating administrative, distributional, and other practical constraints that arise in real-world reform. We develop a method casting tax reform as a constrained optimization problem by parametrizing the entire income tax code as a set of piecewise linear functions mapping tax-relevant inputs into liabilities and marginal rates. This allows users to impose constraints on marginal rate schedules, limits on income swings, and objectives like revenue neutrality, efficiency, simplicity, or distributional fairness that reflect both theoretical and practical considerations. The framework is computationally tractable for complex tax codes and flexible enough to accommodate diverse constraints, welfare objectives and behavioral responses. Whereas existing tools are typically used for ex-post `what-if' analysis of specific reforms, our framework explicitly incorporates real-world reform constraints and jointly optimizes across the full tax code. We illustrate the framework in several simulated settings, including a detailed reconstruction of the Dutch income tax system. For the Dutch case, we generate a family of reforms that smooth existing spikes in marginal tax rates to any desired cap, reduce the number of rules, and impose hard caps on income losses households can experience from the reform. We also introduce \texttt{TaxSolver}, an open-source package, allowing policymakers and researchers to implement and extend the framework.

Abstract: There are various factors that can influence the performance of speaker recognition systems, such as emotion, language and other speaker-related or context-related variations. Since individual speech frames do not contribute equally to the utterance-level representation, it is essential to estimate the importance or reliability of each frame. The xi-vector model addresses this by assigning different weights to frames based on uncertainty estimation. However, its uncertainty estimation model is implicitly trained through classification loss alone and does not consider the temporal relationships between frames, which may lead to suboptimal supervision. In this paper, we propose an improved architecture, xi+. Compared to xi-vector, xi+ incorporates a temporal attention module to capture frame-level uncertainty in a context-aware manner. In addition, we introduce a novel loss function, Stochastic Variance Loss, which explicitly supervises the learning of uncertainty. Results demonstrate consistent performance improvements of about 10\% on the VoxCeleb1-O set and 11\% on the NIST SRE 2024 evaluation set.

Title: Behind the Scenes: Mechanistic Interpretability of LoRA-adapted Whisper for Speech Emotion Recognition
Authors: Yujian Ma, Xikun Lu, Jinqiu Sang, Xianquan Jiang, Ruizhe Li
Abstract: Large pre-trained speech models such as Whisper offer strong generalization but pose significant challenges for resource-efficient adaptation. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, yet its underlying mechanisms in speech tasks remain poorly understood. In this work, we conduct the first systematic mechanistic interpretability study of LoRA within the Whisper encoder for speech emotion recognition (SER). Using a suite of analytical tools, including layer contribution probing, logit-lens inspection, and representational similarity via singular value decomposition (SVD) and centered kernel alignment (CKA), we reveal two key mechanisms: a delayed specialization process that preserves general features in early layers before consolidating task-specific information, and a forward alignment, backward differentiation dynamic between LoRA's matrices. Our findings clarify how LoRA reshapes encoder hierarchies, providing both empirical insights and a deeper mechanistic understanding for designing efficient and interpretable adaptation strategies in large speech models.

Title: PAD-TRO: Projection-Augmented Diffusion for Direct Trajectory Optimization
Authors: Jushan Chen, Santiago Paternain
Abstract: Recently, diffusion models have gained popularity and attention in trajectory optimization due to their capability of modeling multi-modal probability distributions. However, addressing nonlinear equality constraints, i.e, dynamic feasibility, remains a great challenge in diffusion-based trajectory optimization. Recent diffusion-based trajectory optimization frameworks rely on a single-shooting style approach where the denoised control sequence is applied to forward propagate the dynamical system, which cannot explicitly enforce constraints on the states and frequently leads to sub-optimal solutions. In this work, we propose a novel direct trajectory optimization approach via model-based diffusion, which directly generates a sequence of states. To ensure dynamic feasibility, we propose a gradient-free projection mechanism that is incorporated into the reverse diffusion process. Our results show that, compared to a recent state-of-the-art baseline, our approach leads to zero dynamic feasibility error and approximately 4x higher success rate in a quadrotor waypoint navigation scenario involving dense static obstacles.

Abstract: Estimating brain age (BA) from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs) provides a useful approach to map the anatomic features of brain senescence. Whereas global BA (GBA) summarizes overall brain health, local BA (LBA) can reveal spatially localized patterns of aging. Although previous studies have examined anatomical contributors to GBA, no framework has been established to compute LBA using cortical morphology. To address this gap, we introduce a novel graph neural network (GNN) that uses morphometric features (cortical thickness, curvature, surface area, gray/white matter intensity ratio and sulcal depth) to estimate LBA across the cortical surface at high spatial resolution (mean inter-vertex distance = 1.37 mm). Trained on cortical surface meshes extracted from the MRIs of cognitively normal adults (N = 14,250), our GNN identifies prefrontal and parietal association cortices as early sites of morphometric aging, in concordance with biological theories of brain aging. Feature comparison using integrated gradients reveals that morphological aging is driven primarily by changes in surface area (gyral crowns and highly folded regions) and cortical thickness (occipital lobes), with additional contributions from gray/white matter intensity ratio (frontal lobes and sulcal troughs) and curvature (sulcal troughs). In Alzheimers disease (AD), as expected, the model identifies widespread, excessive morphological aging in parahippocampal gyri and related temporal structures. Significant associations are found between regional LBA gaps and neuropsychological measures descriptive of AD-related cognitive impairment, suggesting an intimate relationship between morphological cortical aging and cognitive decline. These results highlight the ability of GNN-derived gero-morphometry to provide insights into local brain aging.
