Title: A CNN-based Local-Global Self-Attention via Averaged Window Embeddings for Hierarchical ECG Analysis
Authors: Arthur Buzelin, Pedro Robles Dutenhefner, Turi Rezende, Luisa G. Porfirio, Pedro Bento, Yan Aquino, Jose Fernandes, Caio Santana, Gabriela Miana, Gisele L. Pappa, Antonio Ribeiro, Wagner Meira Jr
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of global mortality, emphasizing the critical need for efficient diagnostic tools such as electrocardiograms (ECGs). Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly transformers, have revolutionized ECG analysis by capturing detailed waveform features as well as global rhythm patterns. However, traditional transformers struggle to effectively capture local morphological features that are critical for accurate ECG interpretation. We propose a novel Local-Global Attention ECG model (LGA-ECG) to address this limitation, integrating convolutional inductive biases with global self-attention mechanisms. Our approach extracts queries by averaging embeddings obtained from overlapping convolutional windows, enabling fine-grained morphological analysis, while simultaneously modeling global context through attention to keys and values derived from the entire sequence. Experiments conducted on the CODE-15 dataset demonstrate that LGA-ECG outperforms state-of-the-art models and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the local-global attention strategy. By capturing the hierarchical temporal dependencies and morphological patterns in ECG signals, this new design showcases its potential for clinical deployment with robust automated ECG classification.

Title: SeizureFormer: A Transformer Model for IEA-Based Seizure Risk Forecasting
Authors: Tianning Feng (1), Junting Ni (1), Ezequiel Gleichgerrcht (2), Wei Jin (1) ((1) Department of Computer Science, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA, (2) Department of Neurology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA)
Abstract: We present SeizureFormer, a Transformer-based model for long-term seizure risk forecasting using interictal epileptiform activity (IEA) surrogate biomarkers and long episode (LE) biomarkers from responsive neurostimulation (RNS) systems. Unlike raw scalp EEG-based models, SeizureFormer leverages structured, clinically relevant features and integrates CNN-based patch embedding, multi-head self-attention, and squeeze-and-excitation blocks to model both short-term dynamics and long-term seizure cycles. Tested across five patients and multiple prediction windows (1 to 14 days), SeizureFormer achieved state-of-the-art performance with mean ROC AUC of 79.44 percent and mean PR AUC of 76.29 percent. Compared to statistical, machine learning, and deep learning baselines, it demonstrates enhanced generalizability and seizure risk forecasting performance under class imbalance. This work supports future clinical integration of interpretable and robust seizure forecasting tools for personalized epilepsy management.

Title: Two-Timescale Joint Transmit and Pinching Beamforming for Pinching-Antenna Systems
Authors: Luyuan Zhang, Xidong Mu, An Liu, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: Pinching antenna systems (PASS) have been proposed as a revolutionary flexible antenna technology which facilitates line-of-sight links via numerous low-cost pinching antennas with adjustable activation positions over waveguides. This letter proposes a two-timescale joint transmit and pinching beamforming design for the maximization of sum rate of a PASS-based downlink multi-user multiple input single output system. A primal dual decomposition method is developed to decouple the two-timescale problem into two sub-problems: 1) A Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-guided dual learning-based approach is proposed to solve the short-term transmit beamforming design sub-problem; 2) The long-term pinching beamforming design sub-problem is tackled by adopting a stochastic successive convex approximation method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed two-timescale algorithm achieves a significant performance gain compared to other baselines.

Title: Towards Accurate Forecasting of Renewable Energy : Building Datasets and Benchmarking Machine Learning Models for Solar and Wind Power in France
Authors: Eloi Lindas, Yannig Goude, Philippe Ciais
Abstract: Accurate prediction of non-dispatchable renewable energy sources is essential for grid stability and price prediction. Regional power supply forecasts are usually indirect through a bottom-up approach of plant-level forecasts, incorporate lagged power values, and do not use the potential of spatially resolved data. This study presents a comprehensive methodology for predicting solar and wind power production at country scale in France using machine learning models trained with spatially explicit weather data combined with spatial information about production sites capacity. A dataset is built spanning from 2012 to 2023, using daily power production data from RTE (the national grid operator) as the target variable, with daily weather data from ERA5, production sites capacity and location, and electricity prices as input features. Three modeling approaches are explored to handle spatially resolved weather data: spatial averaging over the country, dimension reduction through principal component analysis, and a computer vision architecture to exploit complex spatial relationships. The study benchmarks state-of-the-art machine learning models as well as hyperparameter tuning approaches based on cross-validation methods on daily power production data. Results indicate that cross-validation tailored to time series is best suited to reach low error. We found that neural networks tend to outperform traditional tree-based models, which face challenges in extrapolation due to the increasing renewable capacity over time. Model performance ranges from 4% to 10% in nRMSE for midterm horizon, achieving similar error metrics to local models established at a single-plant level, highlighting the potential of these methods for regional power supply forecasting.

Title: xLSTM-ECG: Multi-label ECG Classification via Feature Fusion with xLSTM
Authors: Lei Kang, Xuanshuo Fu, Javier Vazquez-Corral, Ernest Valveny, Dimosthenis Karatzas
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of mortality worldwide, highlighting the critical need for efficient and accurate diagnostic tools. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are indispensable in diagnosing various heart conditions; however, their manual interpretation is time-consuming and error-prone. In this paper, we propose xLSTM-ECG, a novel approach that leverages an extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) network for multi-label classification of ECG signals, using the PTB-XL dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first design and application of xLSTM modules specifically adapted for multi-label ECG classification. Our method employs a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to convert time-series ECG waveforms into the frequency domain, thereby enhancing feature extraction. The xLSTM architecture is specifically tailored to address the complexities of 12-lead ECG recordings by capturing both local and global signal features. Comprehensive experiments on the PTB-XL dataset reveal that our model achieves strong multi-label classification performance, while additional tests on the Georgia 12-Lead dataset underscore its robustness and efficiency. This approach significantly improves ECG classification accuracy, thereby advancing clinical diagnostics and patient care. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

Title: Phased Array Calibration based on Rotating-Element Harmonic Electric-Field Vector with Time Modulation
Authors: Shiyuan Li, Yuyue Zhou, Chi Zhang, Liang Kong, Kebin Liu, Yihan Xie, Chong He
Abstract: Calibration is crucial for ensuring the performance of phased array since amplitude-phase imbalance between elements results in significant performance degradation. While amplitude-only calibration methods offer advantages when phase measurements are impractical, conventional approaches face two key challenges: they typically require high-resolution phase shifters and remain susceptible to phase errors inherent in these components. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Rotating element Harmonic Electric-field Vector (RHEV) strategy, which enables precise calibration through time modulation principles. The proposed technique functions as follows. Two 1-bit phase shifters are periodically phase-switched at the same frequency, each generating corresponding harmonics. By adjusting the relative delay between their modulation timings, the phase difference between the $+1$st harmonics produced by the two elements can be precisely controlled, utilizing the time-shift property of the Fourier transform. Furthermore, the +1st harmonic generated by sequential modulation of individual elements exhibits a linear relationship with the amplitude of the modulated element, enabling amplitude ambiguity resolution. The proposed RHEV-based calibration method generates phase shifts through relative timing delays rather than physical phase shifter adjustments, rendering it less susceptible to phase shift errors. Additionally, since the calibration process exclusively utilizes the $+1$st harmonic, which is produced solely by the modulated unit, the method demonstrates consistent performance regardless of array size. Extensive numerical simulations, practical in-channel and over-the-air (OTA) calibration experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and distinct advantages of the proposed method.

Title: Micro-Ring Perceptron Sensor for High-Speed, Low-Power Radio-Frequency Signal
Authors: Bo-Han Wu, Shi-Yuan Ma, Sri Krishna Vadlamani, Hyeongrak Choi, Dirk Englund
Abstract: Radio-frequency (RF) sensing enables long-range, high-resolution detection for applications such as radar and wireless communication. RF photonic sensing mitigates the bandwidth limitations and high transmission losses of electronic systems by transducing the detected RF signals into broadband optical carriers. However, these sensing systems remain limited by detector noise and Nyquist rate sampling with analog-to-digital converters, particularly under low-power and high-data rate conditions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the micro-ring perceptron (MiRP) sensor, a physics-inspired AI framework that integrates the micro-ring (MiR) dynamics-based analog processor with a machine-learning-driven digital backend. By embedding the nonlinear optical dynamics of MiRs into an end-to-end architecture, MiRP sensing maps the input signal into a learned feature space for the subsequent digital neural network. The trick is to encode the entire temporal structure of the incoming signal into each output sample in order to enable effectively sub-Nyquist sampling without loss of task-relevant information. Evaluations of three target classification datasets demonstrate the performance advantages of MiRP sensing. For example, on MNIST, MiRP detection achieves $94\pm0.1$\% accuracy at $1/49$ the Nyquist rate at the input RF signal of $1$~ pW, compared to $11\pm0.4$\% for the conventional RF detection method. Thus, our sensor framework provides a robust and efficient solution for the detection of low-power and high-speed signals in real-world sensing applications.

Title: A Self-supervised Learning Method for Raman Spectroscopy based on Masked Autoencoders
Authors: Pengju Ren, Ri-gui Zhou, Yaochong Li
Abstract: Raman spectroscopy serves as a powerful and reliable tool for analyzing the chemical information of substances. The integration of Raman spectroscopy with deep learning methods enables rapid qualitative and quantitative analysis of materials. Most existing approaches adopt supervised learning methods. Although supervised learning has achieved satisfactory accuracy in spectral analysis, it is still constrained by costly and limited well-annotated spectral datasets for training. When spectral annotation is challenging or the amount of annotated data is insufficient, the performance of supervised learning in spectral material identification declines. In order to address the challenge of feature extraction from unannotated spectra, we propose a self-supervised learning paradigm for Raman Spectroscopy based on a Masked AutoEncoder, termed SMAE. SMAE does not require any spectral annotations during pre-training. By randomly masking and then reconstructing the spectral information, the model learns essential spectral features. The reconstructed spectra exhibit certain denoising properties, improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by more than twofold. Utilizing the network weights obtained from masked pre-training, SMAE achieves clustering accuracy of over 80% for 30 classes of isolated bacteria in a pathogenic bacterial dataset, demonstrating significant improvements compared to classical unsupervised methods and other state-of-the-art deep clustering methods. After fine-tuning the network with a limited amount of annotated data, SMAE achieves an identification accuracy of 83.90% on the test set, presenting competitive performance against the supervised ResNet (83.40%).

Title: A Non-Invasive Load Monitoring Method for Edge Computing Based on MobileNetV3 and Dynamic Time Regulation
Authors: Hangxu Liu, Yaojie Sun, Yu Wang
Abstract: In recent years, non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) technology has attracted much attention in the related research field by virtue of its unique advantage of utilizing single meter data to achieve accurate decomposition of device-level energy consumption. Cutting-edge methods based on machine learning and deep learning have achieved remarkable results in load decomposition accuracy by fusing time-frequency domain features. However, these methods generally suffer from high computational costs and huge memory requirements, which become the main obstacles for their deployment on resource-constrained microcontroller units (MCUs). To address these challenges, this study proposes an innovative Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm in the time-frequency domain and systematically compares and analyzes the performance of six machine learning techniques in home electricity scenarios. Through complete experimental validation on edge MCUs, this scheme successfully achieves a recognition accuracy of 95%. Meanwhile, this study deeply optimizes the frequency domain feature extraction process, which effectively reduces the running time by 55.55% and the storage overhead by about 34.6%. The algorithm performance will be further optimized in future research work. Considering that the elimination of voltage transformer design can significantly reduce the cost, the subsequent research will focus on this direction, and is committed to providing more cost-effective solutions for the practical application of NILM, and providing a solid theoretical foundation and feasible technical paths for the design of efficient NILM systems in edge computing environments.

Title: A Statistical Approach for Synthetic EEG Data Generation
Authors: Gideon Vos, Maryam Ebrahimpour, Liza van Eijk, Zoltan Sarnyai, Mostafa Rahimi Azghadi
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) data is crucial for diagnosing mental health conditions but is costly and time-consuming to collect at scale. Synthetic data generation offers a promising solution to augment datasets for machine learning applications. However, generating high-quality synthetic EEG that preserves emotional and mental health signals remains challenging. This study proposes a method combining correlation analysis and random sampling to generate realistic synthetic EEG data. We first analyze interdependencies between EEG frequency bands using correlation analysis. Guided by this structure, we generate synthetic samples via random sampling. Samples with high correlation to real data are retained and evaluated through distribution analysis and classification tasks. A Random Forest model trained to distinguish synthetic from real EEG performs at chance level, indicating high fidelity. The generated synthetic data closely match the statistical and structural properties of the original EEG, with similar correlation coefficients and no significant differences in PERMANOVA tests. This method provides a scalable, privacy-preserving approach for augmenting EEG datasets, enabling more efficient model training in mental health research.

Title: Aerial Active STAR-RIS-assisted Satellite-Terrestrial Covert Communications
Authors: Chuang Zhang, Geng Sun, Jiahui Li, Jiacheng Wang, Ruichen Zhang, Dusit Niyato, Shiwen Mao, Tony Q. S. Quek
Abstract: An integration of satellites and terrestrial networks is crucial for enhancing performance of next generation communication systems. However, the networks are hindered by the long-distance path loss and security risks in dense urban environments. In this work, we propose a satellite-terrestrial covert communication system assisted by the aerial active simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (AASTAR-RIS) to improve the channel capacity while ensuring the transmission covertness. Specifically, we first derive the minimal detection error probability (DEP) under the worst condition that the Warden has perfect channel state information (CSI). Then, we formulate an AASTAR-RIS-assisted satellite-terrestrial covert communication optimization problem (ASCCOP) to maximize the sum of the fair channel capacity for all ground users while meeting the strict covert constraint, by jointly optimizing the trajectory and active beamforming of the AASTAR-RIS. Due to the challenges posed by the complex and high-dimensional state-action spaces as well as the need for efficient exploration in dynamic environments, we propose a generative deterministic policy gradient (GDPG) algorithm, which is a generative deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to solve the ASCCOP. Concretely, the generative diffusion model (GDM) is utilized as the policy representation of the algorithm to enhance the exploration process by generating diverse and high-quality samples through a series of denoising steps. Moreover, we incorporate an action gradient mechanism to accomplish the policy improvement of the algorithm, which refines the better state-action pairs through the gradient ascent. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms important benchmarks.

Title: One-Point Sampling for Distributed Bandit Convex Optimization with Time-Varying Constraints
Authors: Kunpeng Zhang, Lei Xu, Xinlei Yi, Guanghui Wen, Lihua Xie, Tianyou Chai, Tao Yang
Abstract: This paper considers the distributed bandit convex optimization problem with time-varying constraints. In this problem, the global loss function is the average of all the local convex loss functions, which are unknown beforehand. Each agent iteratively makes its own decision subject to time-varying inequality constraints which can be violated but are fulfilled in the long run. For a uniformly jointly strongly connected time-varying directed graph, a distributed bandit online primal-dual projection algorithm with one-point sampling is proposed. We show that sublinear dynamic network regret and network cumulative constraint violation are achieved if the path-length of the benchmark also increases in a sublinear manner. In addition, an $\mathcal{O}({T^{3/4 + g}})$ static network regret bound and an $\mathcal{O}( {{T^{1 - {g}/2}}} )$ network cumulative constraint violation bound are established, where $T$ is the total number of iterations and $g \in ( {0,1/4} )$ is a trade-off parameter. Moreover, a reduced static network regret bound $\mathcal{O}( {T^{2/3 + 4g /3}} )$ is established for strongly convex local loss functions. Finally, a numerical example is presented to validate the theoretical results.

Title: A Thin Flexible Acoustic Transducer with piezoelectric-actuated microdomes for Underwater Communication
Authors: Rong Fu, Xinyu Zhang, Cheng-Hao Yu, Kai Liu, Tauhidul Haque, Leixin Ouyang, Mark Ming-Cheng Cheng
Abstract: This paper presents a flexible thin-film underwater transducer based on a mesoporous PVDF membrane embedded with piezoelectrical-actuated microdomes. To enhance piezoelectric performance, ZnO nanoparticles were used as a sacrificial template to fabricate a sponge-like PVDF structure with increased \b{eta}-phase content and improved mechanical compliance. The device was modeled using finite element analysis and optimized through parametric studies of dome geometry, film thickness, and dome size. Acoustic performance was evaluated through underwater testing, demonstrating high SPL output and reliable data transmission even at low drive voltages. The proposed transducer offers a lightweight, low-cost, and energy-efficient solution for short-range underwater communication in next-generation Ocean IoT systems.

Title: Robust Resource Allocation for Over-the-Air Computation Networks with Fluid Antenna Array
Authors: Saeid Pakravan, Mohsen Ahmadzadeh, Ming Zeng, Ghosheh Abed Hodtani, Jean-Yves Chouinard, Leslie A Rusch
Abstract: Fluid antenna (FA) array is envisioned as a promising technology for next-generation communication systems, owing to its ability to dynamically control the antenna locations. In this paper, we apply FA array to boost the performance of over-the-air computation networks. Given that channel uncertainty will impact negatively not only the beamforming design but also the antenna location optimization, robust resource allocation is performed to minimize the mean squared error of transmitted messages. Block coordinate descent is adopted to decompose the formulated non-convex problem into three subproblems, which are iteratively solved until convergence. Numerical results show the benefits of FA array and the necessity of robust resource allocation under channel uncertainty.

Title: Nash Equilibrium Learning In Large Populations With First Order Payoff Modifications
Authors: Matthew S. Hankins, Jair Certório, Tzuyu Jeng, Nuno C. Martins
Abstract: We establish Nash equilibrium learning -- convergence of the population state to a suitably defined Nash equilibria set -- for a class of payoff dynamical mechanism with a first order modification. The first order payoff modification can model aspects of the agents' bounded rationality, anticipatory or averaging terms in the payoff mechanism, or first order Padé approximations of delays. To obtain our main results, we apply a combination of two nonstandard system-theoretic passivity notions.

Title: Comprehensive Evaluation of Quantitative Measurements from Automated Deep Segmentations of PSMA PET/CT Images
Authors: Obed Korshie Dzikunu, Amirhossein Toosi, Shadab Ahamed, Sara Harsini, Francois Benard, Xiaoxiao Li, Arman Rahmim
Abstract: This study performs a comprehensive evaluation of quantitative measurements as extracted from automated deep-learning-based segmentation methods, beyond traditional Dice Similarity Coefficient assessments, focusing on six quantitative metrics, namely SUVmax, SUVmean, total lesion activity (TLA), tumor volume (TMTV), lesion count, and lesion spread. We analyzed 380 prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeted [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT scans of patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer, training deep neural networks, U-Net, Attention U-Net and SegResNet with four loss functions: Dice Loss, Dice Cross Entropy, Dice Focal Loss, and our proposed L1 weighted Dice Focal Loss (L1DFL). Evaluations indicated that Attention U-Net paired with L1DFL achieved the strongest correlation with the ground truth (concordance correlation = 0.90-0.99 for SUVmax and TLA), whereas models employing the Dice Loss and the other two compound losses, particularly with SegResNet, underperformed. Equivalence testing (TOST, alpha = 0.05, Delta = 20%) confirmed high performance for SUV metrics, lesion count and TLA, with L1DFL yielding the best performance. By contrast, tumor volume and lesion spread exhibited greater variability. Bland-Altman, Coverage Probability, and Total Deviation Index analyses further highlighted that our proposed L1DFL minimizes variability in quantification of the ground truth clinical measures.

Title: Deep, data-driven modeling of room acoustics: literature review and research perspectives
Authors: Toon van Waterschoot
Abstract: Our everyday auditory experience is shaped by the acoustics of the indoor environments in which we live. Room acoustics modeling is aimed at establishing mathematical representations of acoustic wave propagation in such environments. These representations are relevant to a variety of problems ranging from echo-aided auditory indoor navigation to restoring speech understanding in cocktail party scenarios. Many disciplines in science and engineering have recently witnessed a paradigm shift powered by deep learning (DL), and room acoustics research is no exception. The majority of deep, data-driven room acoustics models are inspired by DL-based speech and image processing, and hence lack the intrinsic space-time structure of acoustic wave propagation. More recently, DL-based models for room acoustics that include either geometric or wave-based information have delivered promising results, primarily for the problem of sound field reconstruction. In this review paper, we will provide an extensive and structured literature review on deep, data-driven modeling in room acoustics. Moreover, we position these models in a framework that allows for a conceptual comparison with traditional physical and data-driven models. Finally, we identify strengths and shortcomings of deep, data-driven room acoustics models and outline the main challenges for further research.

Title: Discrete Codebook Design for Self-interference Suppression in mmWave ISAC
Authors: Guang Chai, Zhibin Yu, Xiaofeng Wu, Giuseppe Caire
Abstract: This paper presents discrete codebook synthesis methods for self-interference (SI) suppression in a mmWave device, designed to support FD ISAC. We formulate a SINR maximization problem that optimizes the RX and TX codewords, aimed at suppressing the near-field SI signal while maintaining the beamforming gain in the far-field sensing directions. The formulation considers the practical constraints of discrete RX and TX codebooks with quantized phase settings, as well as a TX beamforming gain requirement in the specified communication direction. Under an alternating optimization framework, the RX and TX codewords are iteratively optimized, with one fixed while the other is optimized. When the TX codeword is fixed, we show that the RX codeword optimization problem can be formulated as an integer quadratic fractional programming (IQFP) problem. Using Dinkelbach's algorithm, we transform the problem into a sequence of subproblems in which the numerator and the denominator of the objective function are decoupled. These subproblems, subject to discrete constraints, are then efficiently solved by the spherical search (SS) method. This overall approach is referred to as FP-SS. When the RX codeword is fixed, the TX codeword optimization problem can similarly be formulated as an IQFP problem, whereas an additional TX beamforming constraint for communication needs to be considered. The problem is solved through Dinkelbach's transformation followed by the constrained spherical search (CSS), and we refer to this approach as FP-CSS. Finally, we integrate the FP-SS and FP-CSS methods into a joint RX-TX codebook design approach. Simulations show that, the proposed FP-SS and FP-CSS achieve the same SI suppression performance as the corresponding exhaustive search method, but with much lower complexity. Furthermore, the alternating optimization framework achieved even better SI suppression performance.

Title: Self-Nomination: Deep Learning for Decentralized CSI Feedback Reduction in MU-MIMO Systems
Authors: Juseong Park, Foad Sohrabi, Jinfeng Du, Jeffrey G. Andrews
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep learning-based user-side feedback reduction framework, termed self-nomination. The goal of self-nomination is to reduce the number of users (UEs) feeding back channel state information (CSI) to the base station (BS), by letting each UE decide whether to feed back based on its estimated likelihood of being scheduled and its potential contribution to precoding in a multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) downlink. Unlike SNR- or SINR-based thresholding methods, the proposed approach uses rich spatial channel statistics and learns nontrivial correlation effects that affect eventual MU-MIMO scheduling decisions. To train the self-nomination network under an average feedback constraint, we propose two different strategies: one based on direct optimization with gradient approximations, and another using policy gradient-based optimization with a stochastic Bernoulli policy to handle non-differentiable scheduling. The framework also supports proportional-fair scheduling by incorporating dynamic user weights. Numerical results confirm that the proposed self-nomination method significantly reduces CSI feedback overhead. Compared to baseline feedback methods, self-nomination can reduce feedback by as much as 65%, saving not only bandwidth but also allowing many UEs to avoid feedback altogether (and thus, potentially enter a sleep mode). Self-nomination achieves this significant savings with negligible reduction in sum-rate or fairness.

Title: Lightweight and Self-Evolving Channel Twinning: An Ensemble DMD-Assisted Approach
Authors: Yashuai Cao, Jintao Wang, Xu Shi, Wei Ni
Abstract: Traditional channel acquisition faces significant limitations due to ideal model assumptions and scalability challenges. A novel environment-aware paradigm, known as channel twinning, tackles these issues by constructing radio propagation environment semantics using a data-driven approach. In the spotlight of channel twinning technology, a radio map is recognized as an effective region-specific model for learning the spatial distribution of channel information. However, most studies focus on static channel map construction, with only a few collecting numerous channel samples and using deep learning for radio map prediction. In this paper, we develop a novel dynamic radio map twinning framework with a substantially small dataset. Specifically, we present an innovative approach that employs dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to model the evolution of the dynamic channel gain map as a dynamical system. We first interpret dynamic channel gain maps as spatio-temporal video stream data. The coarse-grained and fine-grained evolving modes are extracted from the stream data using a new ensemble DMD (Ens-DMD) algorithm. To mitigate the impact of noisy data, we design a median-based threshold mask technique to filter the noise artifacts of the twin maps. With the proposed DMD-based radio map twinning framework, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the low-complexity reproduction and evolution of the channel gain maps. Furthermore, we consider four radio map twin performance metrics to confirm the superiority of our framework compared to the baselines.

Title: Distributed Space Resource Logistics Architecture Optimization under Economies of Scale
Authors: Evangelia Gkaravela, Hang Woon Lee, Hao Chen
Abstract: This paper proposes an optimization framework for distributed resource logistics system design to support future multimission space exploration. The performance and impact of distributed In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) systems in facilitating space transportation are analyzed. The proposed framework considers technology trade studies, deployment strategy, facility location evaluation, and resource logistics after production for distributed ISRU systems. We develop piecewise linear sizing and cost estimation models based on economies of scale that can be easily integrated into network-based mission planning formulations. A case study on a multi-mission cislunar logistics campaign is conducted to demonstrate the value of the proposed method and evaluate key tradeoffs to compare the performance of distributed ISRU systems with traditional concentrated ISRU. Finally, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the proposed system under varying conditions, comparing concentrated and distributed ISRU systems.

Title: Robust Transmission Design for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface and Movable Antenna Enabled Symbiotic Radio Communications
Authors: Bin Lyu, Hao Liu, Meng Hua, Wenqing Hong, Shimin Gong, Feng Tian, Abbas Jamalipour
Abstract: This paper explores the application of movable antenna (MA), a cutting-edge technology with the capability of altering antenna positions, in a symbiotic radio (SR) system enabled by reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). The goal is to fully exploit the capabilities of both MA and RIS, constructing a better transmission environment for the co-existing primary and secondary transmission systems. For both parasitic SR (PSR) and commensal SR (CSR) scenarios with the channel uncertainties experienced by all transmission links, we design a robust transmission scheme with the goal of maximizing the primary rate while ensuring the secondary transmission quality. To address the maximization problem with thorny non-convex characteristics, we propose an alternating optimization framework that utilizes the General S-Procedure, General Sign-Definiteness Principle, successive convex approximation (SCA), and simulated annealing (SA) improved particle swarm optimization (SA-PSO) algorithms. Numerical results validate that the CSR scenario significantly outperforms the PSR scenario in terms of primary rate, and also show that compared to the fixed-position antenna scheme, the proposed MA scheme can increase the primary rate by 1.62 bps/Hz and 2.37 bps/Hz for the PSR and CSR scenarios, respectively.

Title: Joint Topology and Power Optimization for Multi-UAV Collaborative Secure Communication
Authors: Bin Qiu, Wenchi Cheng, Hongxiang He, Wei Zhang
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled secure communication scenario that a cluster of UAVs performs a virtual non-uniform linear array (NULA) to communicate with a base station (BS) in the presence of eavesdroppers (Eves). Our goal is to design the UAV topology, trajectory, and precoding to maximize the system channel capacity. To this end, we convert the original problem into equivalent two-stage problems. Specifically, we first try to maximize the channel gain by meticulously designing the UAV topology. We then study the joint optimization of the trajectory and precoding for total transmit power minimization while satisfying the constraints on providing quality of service (QoS) assurance to the BS, the leakage tolerance to Eves, the per-UAV transmit power, the initial/final locations, and the cylindrical no-fly zones. For the UAV topology design, we prove that the topology follows the Fekete-point distribution. The design of trajectory and precoding is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem which is generally intractable. Subsequently, the non-convex constraints are converted into convex terms, and a double-loop search algorithm is proposed to solve the transmit power minimization problem. Introduce random rotation offsets so as to perform a dynamic stochastic channel to enhance the security. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in promoting capacity.

Title: Hierarchical Distributed Architecture for the Least Allan Variance Atomic Timing
Authors: Jiayu Chen, Takahiro Kawaguchi, Yuichiro Yano, Yuko Hanado, Takayuki Ishizaki
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a hierarchical distributed timing architecture based on an ensemble of miniature atomic clocks. The goal is to ensure synchronized and accurate timing in a normal operating mode where Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are available, as well as in an emergency operating mode during GNSS failures. At the lower level, the miniature atomic clocks employ a distributed control strategy that uses only local information to ensure synchronization in both modes. The resulting synchronized time or generated time scale has the best frequency stability, as measured by the Allan variance, over the short control period. In the upper layer, a supervisor controls the long-term behavior of the generated time scale. In the normal operating mode, the supervisor periodically anchors the generated time scale to the standard time based on GNSS signals, while in the emergency operating mode, it applies optimal floating control to reduce the divergence rate of the generated time scale, which is not observable from the measurable time difference between the miniature atomic clocks. This floating control aims to explicitly control the generated time scale to have the least Allan variance over the long control period. Finally, numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the architecture in high-precision, GNSS-resilient atomic timing.

Title: Anytime Safe Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Pol Mestres, Arnau Marzabal, Jorge Cortés
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of solving constrained reinforcement learning problems with anytime guarantees, meaning that the algorithmic solution returns a safe policy regardless of when it is terminated. Drawing inspiration from anytime constrained optimization, we introduce Reinforcement Learning-based Safe Gradient Flow (RL-SGF), an on-policy algorithm which employs estimates of the value functions and their respective gradients associated with the objective and safety constraints for the current policy, and updates the policy parameters by solving a convex quadratically constrained quadratic program. We show that if the estimates are computed with a sufficiently large number of episodes (for which we provide an explicit bound), safe policies are updated to safe policies with a probability higher than a prescribed tolerance. We also show that iterates asymptotically converge to a neighborhood of a KKT point, whose size can be arbitrarily reduced by refining the estimates of the value function and their gradients. We illustrate the performance of RL-SGF in a navigation example.

Abstract: In conventional deep speaker embedding frameworks, the pooling layer aggregates all frame-level features over time and computes their mean and standard deviation statistics as inputs to subsequent segment-level layers. Such statistics pooling strategy produces fixed-length representations from variable-length speech segments. However, this method treats different frame-level features equally and discards covariance information. In this paper, we propose the Semi-orthogonal parameter pooling of Covariance matrix (SoCov) method. The SoCov pooling computes the covariance matrix from the self-attentive frame-level features and compresses it into a vector using the semi-orthogonal parametric vectorization, which is then concatenated with the weighted standard deviation vector to form inputs to the segment-level layers. Deep embedding based on SoCov is called ``sc-vector''. The proposed sc-vector is compared to several different baselines on the SRE21 development and evaluation sets. The sc-vector system significantly outperforms the conventional x-vector system, with a relative reduction in EER of 15.5% on SRE21Eval. When using self-attentive deep feature, SoCov helps to reduce EER on SRE21Eval by about 30.9% relatively to the conventional ``mean + standard deviation'' statistics.

Title: Power-based control of output oscillations with online estimation of biased harmonics
Authors: Michael Ruderman, Denis Efimov
Abstract: The recently introduced discrete power-based control (Ruderman (2024b)) reduces largely the communication efforts in the control loop when compensating for the marginally damped or even slowly diverging output oscillations. The control commutates twice per oscillations period (at the amplitude peaks) and uses the measured harmonic output only. The power-based control scheme requires the knowledge of the instantaneous frequency, amplitude, and bias parameters of the harmonic signal. This paper extends the power-based control by the finite-time estimation of the biased harmonics (Ahmed et al. (2022)). Also an improved analytic calculation of the impulse weighting factor is provided. The power-based oscillations control with online estimation of the harmonic parameters is evaluated experimentally on the fifth-order actuator system with a free hanging load under gravity and measurement noise.

Title: Distributed Optimization with Efficient Communication, Event-Triggered Solution Enhancement, and Operation Stopping
Authors: Apostolos I. Rikos, Wei Jiang, Themistoklis Charalambous, Karl H. Johansson
Abstract: In modern large-scale systems with sensor networks and IoT devices it is essential to collaboratively solve complex problems while utilizing network resources efficiently. In our paper we present three distributed optimization algorithms that exhibit efficient communication among nodes. Our first algorithm presents a simple quantized averaged gradient procedure for distributed optimization, which is shown to converge to a neighborhood of the optimal solution. Our second algorithm incorporates a novel event-triggered refinement mechanism, which refines the utilized quantization level to enhance the precision of the estimated optimal solution. It enables nodes to terminate their operation according to predefined performance guarantees. Our third algorithm is tailored to operate in environments where each message consists of only a few bits. It incorporates a novel event-triggered mechanism for adjusting the quantizer basis and quantization level, allowing nodes to collaboratively decide operation termination based on predefined performance criteria. We analyze the three algorithms and establish their linear convergence. Finally, an application on distributed sensor fusion for target localization is used to demonstrate their favorable performance compared to existing algorithms in the literature.

Title: LiDAL-Assisted RLNC-NOMA in OWC Systems
Authors: Ahmed A. Hassan, Ahmad Adnan Qidan, Taisir Elgorashi, Jaafar Elmirghani
Abstract: Optical wireless communication (OWC) is envisioned as a key enabler for immersive indoor data transmission in future wireless communication networks. However, multi-user interference management arises as a challenge in dense indoor OWC systems composed of multiple optical access points (APs) serving multiple users. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-function OWC system for communication and localization. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with random linear network coding (RLNC) is designed for data transmission, where NOMA allows the serving of multiple users simultaneously through controlling the power domain, and RLNC helps minimize errors that might occur during signal processing phase. This setup is assisted with a light detection and localization system (LiDAL) that can passively obtain spatio-temporal indoor information of user presence and location for dynamic-user grouping. The designed LiDAL system helps to improve the estimation of channel state information (CSI) in realistic indoor network scenarios, where the CSI of indoor users might be noisy and/or highly correlated. We evaluate the performance of NOMA combined with RLNC by analyzing the probability of successful decoding compared to conventional NOMA and orthogonal schemes. In addition, we derive the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) to evaluate the accuracy of location estimation. The results show that the proposed RLNC-NOMA improves the probability of successful decoding and the overall system performance. The results also show the high accuracy of the unbiased location estimator and its assistant in reducing the imperfection of CSI, leading to high overall system performance.

Title: Performance Assessment of Hybrid and Digital Irregular Array Configurations for Beyond 100-GHz Multi-User MIMO Systems
Authors: Yigit Ertugrul, Kamil Yavuz Kapusuz, Claude Desset, Sofie Pollin
Abstract: The performance of irregular phased array architectures is assessed in the context of multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) communications operating beyond 100 GHz. Realizing half-wavelength spaced planar phased arrays is challenging due to wavelength-integrated circuit (IC) size conflict at those frequencies where the antenna dimensions are comparable to IC size. Therefore, irregular array architectures such as thinned and clustered arrays are developed to mitigate the wavelength-IC size conflict. In the thinned arrays, radiating elements are permanently deactivated, while in clustered arrays, neighboring elements are grouped into subarrays. Furthermore, irregular arrays are integrated with hybrid beamforming architectures to manage the complexity introduced by full digital beamforming, where a single radio frequency chain is connected per power amplifier. An optimization problem is formulated to determine the optimal arrangement of antenna elements where the trade-off between spectral efficiency (SE) and sidelobe levels (SLL) can be tuned. Clustered array configurations are optimized by genetic algorithm and Algorithm-X based methodologies, where the former relies on a randomized search and the latter exploits brute-force search, respectively. Furthermore, a prototype array is designed on a printed circuit board (PCB) to verify the proposed methodologies through full-wave simulations. To have a fair comparison, clustered arrays with a grouping of two and four elements are compared with thinned arrays with half and quarter thinning ratios, respectively. The combination of hybrid and irregular array architectures leads to minimal or no performance degradation in the case of hybrid fully connected architectures but severe SE and SLL degradation in the case of hybrid partially connected architectures, respectively.

Title: Uplink Sum Rate Maximization for Pinching Antenna-Assisted Multiuser MISO
Authors: Jiarui Zhang, Hao Xu, Chongjun Ouyang, Qiuyun Zou, Hongwen Yang
Abstract: This article investigates the application of pinching-antenna systems (PASS) in multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) communications. Two sum-rate maximization problems are formulated under minimum mean square error (MMSE) decoding, with and without successive interference cancellation (SIC). To address the joint optimization of pinching antenna locations and user transmit powers, a fractional programming-based approach is proposed. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and show that PASS can significantly enhance uplink sum-rate performance compared to conventional fixed-antenna designs.

Title: Data-Assimilated Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Partially Observed Chaotic Flows
Authors: Defne E. Ozan, Andrea Nóvoa, Luca Magri
Abstract: The goal of many applications in energy and transport sectors is to control turbulent flows. However, because of chaotic dynamics and high dimensionality, the control of turbulent flows is exceedingly difficult. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods can discover optimal control policies by interacting with the environment, but they require full state information, which is often unavailable in experimental settings. We propose a data-assimilated model-based RL (DA-MBRL) framework for systems with partial observability and noisy measurements. Our framework employs a control-aware Echo State Network for data-driven prediction of the dynamics, and integrates data assimilation with an Ensemble Kalman Filter for real-time state estimation. An off-policy actor-critic algorithm is employed to learn optimal control strategies from state estimates. The framework is tested on the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, demonstrating its effectiveness in stabilizing a spatiotemporally chaotic flow from noisy and partial measurements.

Title: UAV-Mounted IRS (UMI) in the Presence of Hovering Fluctuations: 3D Pattern Characterization and Performance Analysis
Authors: Mohammad Javad Zakavi, Mahtab Mirmohseni, Farid Ashtiani, Masoumeh Nasiri-Kenari
Abstract: This paper investigates unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) to leverage the benefits of this technology for future communication networks, such as 6G. Key advantages include enhanced spectral and energy efficiency, expanded network coverage, and flexible deployment. One of the main challenges in employing UAV-mounted IRS (UMI) technology is the random fluctuations of hovering UAVs. Focusing on this challenge, this paper explores the capabilities of UMI with passive/active elements affected by UAV fluctuations in both horizontal and vertical angles, considering the three-dimensional (3D) radiation pattern of the IRS. The relationship between UAV fluctuations and IRS pattern is investigated by taking into account the random angular vibrations of UAVs. A tractable and closed-form distribution function for the IRS pattern is derived, using linear approximation and by dividing it into several sectors. In addition, closed-form expressions for outage probability (OP) are obtained using central limit theorem (CLT) and Gamma approximation. The theoretical expressions are validated through Monte Carlo simulations. The findings indicate that the random fluctuations of hovering UAVs have a notable impact on the performance of UMI systems. To avoid link interruptions due to UAV instability, IRS should utilize fewer elements, even though this leads to a decrease in directivity. As a result, unlike terrestrial IRS, incorporating more elements into aerial IRS systems does not necessarily improve performance due to the fluctuations in UAV. Numerical results show that the OP can be minimized by selecting the optimal number of IRS elements and using active elements.

Title: A Novel Sparse Sum and Difference Co-Array With Low Redundancy and Enhanced DOF for Non-Circular Signals
Authors: Si Wang, Guoqiang Xiao
Abstract: Array structures based on the sum and difference co-arrays provide more degrees of freedom (DOF). However, since the growth of DOF is limited by a single case of sum and difference co-arrays, the paper aims to design a sparse linear array (SLA) with higher DOF via exploring different cases of second-order cumulants. We present a mathematical framework based on second-order cumulant to devise a second-order extended co-array (SO-ECA) and define the redundancy of SO-ECA. Based on SO-ECA, a novel array is proposed, namely low redundancy sum and difference array (LR-SDA), which can provide closed-form expressions for the sensor positions and enhance DOF in order to resolve more signal sources in the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation of non-circular (NC) signals. For LR-SDA, the maximum DOF under the given number of total physical sensors can be derived and the SO-ECA of LR-SDA is hole-free. Further, the corresponding necessary and sufficient conditions of signal reconstruction for LR-SDA are derived. Additionally, the redundancy and weight function of LR-SDA are defined, and the lower band of the redundancy for LR-SDA is derived. The proposed LR-SDA achieves higher DOF and lower redundancy than those of existing DCAs designed based on sum and difference co-arrays. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify the superiority of LR-SDA on DOA estimation performance and enhanced DOF over other existing DCAs.

Title: On the Asymptotic MSE-Optimality of Parametric Bayesian Channel Estimation in mmWave Systems
Authors: Franz Weißer, Wolfgang Utschick
Abstract: The mean square error (MSE)-optimal estimator is known to be the conditional mean estimator (CME). This paper introduces a parametric channel estimation technique based on Bayesian estimation. This technique uses the estimated channel parameters to parameterize the well-known LMMSE channel estimator. We first derive an asymptotic CME formulation that holds for a wide range of priors on the channel parameters. Based on this, we show that parametric Bayesian channel estimation is MSE-optimal for high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and/or long coherence intervals, i.e., many noisy observations provided within one coherence interval. Numerical simulations validate the derived formulations.

Title: Frequency-Compensated Network for Daily Arctic Sea Ice Concentration Prediction
Authors: Jialiang Zhang, Feng Gao, Yanhai Gan, Junyu Dong, Qian Du
Abstract: Accurately forecasting sea ice concentration (SIC) in the Arctic is critical to global ecosystem health and navigation safety. However, current methods still is confronted with two challenges: 1) these methods rarely explore the long-term feature dependencies in the frequency domain. 2) they can hardly preserve the high-frequency details, and the changes in the marginal area of the sea ice cannot be accurately captured. To this end, we present a Frequency-Compensated Network (FCNet) for Arctic SIC prediction on a daily basis. In particular, we design a dual-branch network, including branches for frequency feature extraction and convolutional feature extraction. For frequency feature extraction, we design an adaptive frequency filter block, which integrates trainable layers with Fourier-based filters. By adding frequency features, the FCNet can achieve refined prediction of edges and details. For convolutional feature extraction, we propose a high-frequency enhancement block to separate high and low-frequency information. Moreover, high-frequency features are enhanced via channel-wise attention, and temporal attention unit is employed for low-frequency feature extraction to capture long-range sea ice changes. Extensive experiments are conducted on a satellite-derived daily SIC dataset, and the results verify the effectiveness of the proposed FCNet. Our codes and data will be made public available at: this https URL .

Title: Advanced Chest X-Ray Analysis via Transformer-Based Image Descriptors and Cross-Model Attention Mechanism
Authors: Lakshita Agarwal, Bindu Verma
Abstract: The examination of chest X-ray images is a crucial component in detecting various thoracic illnesses. This study introduces a new image description generation model that integrates a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder with cross-modal attention and a GPT-4-based transformer decoder. The ViT captures high-quality visual features from chest X-rays, which are fused with text data through cross-modal attention to improve the accuracy, context, and richness of image descriptions. The GPT-4 decoder transforms these fused features into accurate and relevant captions. The model was tested on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Indiana University (IU) Chest X-ray datasets. On the IU dataset, it achieved scores of 0.854 (B-1), 0.883 (CIDEr), 0.759 (METEOR), and 0.712 (ROUGE-L). On the NIH dataset, it achieved the best performance on all metrics: BLEU 1--4 (0.825, 0.788, 0.765, 0.752), CIDEr (0.857), METEOR (0.726), and ROUGE-L (0.705). This framework has the potential to enhance chest X-ray evaluation, assisting radiologists in more precise and efficient diagnosis.

Title: Array Partitioning Based Near-Field Attitude and Location Estimation
Authors: Mingchen Zhang, Xiaojun Yuan, Boyu Teng, Li Wang
Abstract: This paper studies a passive source localization system, where a single base station (BS) is employed to estimate the positions and attitudes of multiple mobile stations (MSs). The BS and the MSs are equipped with uniform rectangular arrays, and the MSs are located in the near-field region of the BS array. To avoid the difficulty of tackling the problem directly based on the near-field signal model, we establish a subarray-wise far-field received signal model. In this model, the entire BS array is divided into multiple subarrays to ensure that each MS is in the far-field region of each BS subarray. By exploiting the angles of arrival (AoAs) of an MS antenna at different BS subarrays, we formulate the attitude and location estimation problem under the Bayesian inference framework. Based on the factor graph representation of the probabilistic problem model, a message passing algorithm named array partitioning based pose and location estimation (APPLE) is developed to solve this problem. An estimation-error lower bound is obtained as a performance benchmark of the proposed algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed APPLE algorithm outperforms other baseline methods in the accuracy of position and attitude estimation.

Title: Association-Based Track-Before-Detect with Object Contribution Probabilities
Authors: Thomas Kropfreiter, Jason L. Williams, Florian Meyer
Abstract: Multiobject tracking provides situational awareness that enables new applications for modern convenience, applied ocean sciences, public safety, and homeland security. In many multiobject tracking applications, including radar and sonar tracking, after coherent prefiltering of the received signal, measurement data is typically structured in cells, where each cell represent, e.g., a different range and bearing value. While conventional detect-then-track (DTT) multiobject tracking approaches convert the cell-structured data within a detection phase into so-called point measurements in order to reduce the amount of data, track-before-detect (TBD) methods process the cell-structured data directly, avoiding a potential information loss. However, many TBD tracking methods are computationally intensive and achieve a reduced tracking accuracy when objects interact, i.e., when they come into close proximity. We here counteract these difficulties by introducing the concept of probabilistic object-to-cell contributions. As many conventional DTT methods, our approach uses a probabilistic association of objects with data cells, and a new object contribution model with corresponding object contribution probabilities to further associate cell contributions to objects that occupy the same data cell. Furthermore, to keep the computational complexity and filter runtimes low, we here use an efficient Poisson multi-Bernoulli filtering approach in combination with the application of belief propagation for fast probabilistic data association. We demonstrate numerically that our method achieves significantly increased tracking performance compared to state-of-the-art TBD tracking approaches, where performance differences are particularly pronounced when multiple objects interact.

Title: Distributed Unknown Input Observers for Discrete-Time Linear Time-Invariant Systems
Authors: Franco Angelo Torchiaro, Gianfranco Gagliardi, Francesco Tedesco, Alessandro Casavola
Abstract: This paper introduces a Distributed Unknown Input Observer (D-UIO) design methodology that uses a technique called node-wise detectability decomposition to estimate the state of a discrete-time linear time-invariant (LTI) system in a distributed way, even when there are noisy measurements and unknown inputs. In the considered scenario, sensors are associated to nodes of an underlying communication graph. Each node has a limited scope as it can only access local measurements and share data with its neighbors. The problem of designing the observer gains is divided into two separate sub-problems: (i) design local output injection gains to mitigate the impact of measurement noise, and (ii) design diffusive gains to compensate for the lack of information through a consensus protocol. A direct and computationally efficient synthesis strategy is formulated by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and solved via semidefinite programming. Finally, two simulative scenarios are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the distributed observer when two different node-wise decompositions are adopted.

Title: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Control for a Moving Receiver
Authors: Hamed Radpour, Markus Hofer, Thomas Zemen
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are emerging as key enablers of reliable industrial automation in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band, particularly in environments with frequent line-of-sight (LoS) blockage. While prior works have largely focused on theoretical aspects, real-time validation under user mobility remains underexplored. In this work, we propose and experimentally evaluate a self-adaptive beamforming algorithm that enables RIS reconfiguration based on a low-rate feedback link from the mobile user equipment (UE) to the RIS controller. The algorithm maintains received signal power above a predefined threshold without requiring UE position knowledge. Using a hexagonal RIS with 127 elements operating at 23.8 GHz, we validate our approach in a semi-anechoic environment over a 60 cm*100 cm observation area. The results demonstrate up to 24 dB gain in received power compared to the baseline with inactive RIS elements, highlighting the practical benefits of adaptive RIS control in mobile non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios.

Title: Learning Verifiable Control Policies Using Relaxed Verification
Authors: Puja Chaudhury, Alexander Estornell, Michael Everett
Abstract: To provide safety guarantees for learning-based control systems, recent work has developed formal verification methods to apply after training ends. However, if the trained policy does not meet the specifications, or there is conservatism in the verification algorithm, establishing these guarantees may not be possible. Instead, this work proposes to perform verification throughout training to ultimately aim for policies whose properties can be evaluated throughout runtime with lightweight, relaxed verification algorithms. The approach is to use differentiable reachability analysis and incorporate new components into the loss function. Numerical experiments on a quadrotor model and unicycle model highlight the ability of this approach to lead to learned control policies that satisfy desired reach-avoid and invariance specifications.

Title: An Accelerated Camera 3DMA Framework for Efficient Urban GNSS Multipath Estimation
Authors: Shiyao Lv, Xin Zhang, Xingqun Zhan
Abstract: Robust GNSS positioning in urban environments is still plagued by multipath effects, particularly due to the complex signal propagation induced by ubiquitous surfaces with varied radio frequency reflectivities. Current 3D Mapping Aided (3DMA) GNSS techniques show great potentials in mitigating multipath but face a critical trade-off between computational efficiency and modeling accuracy. Most approaches often rely on offline outdated or oversimplified 3D maps, while real-time LiDAR-based reconstruction boasts high accuracy, it is problematic in low laser reflectivity conditions; camera 3DMA is a good candidate to balance accuracy and efficiency but current methods suffer from extremely low reconstruction speed, a far cry from real-time multipath-mitigated navigation. This paper proposes an accelerated framework incorporating camera multi-view stereo (MVS) reconstruction and ray tracing. By hypothesizing on surface textures, an orthogonal visual feature fusion framework is proposed, which robustly addresses both texture-rich and texture-poor surfaces, lifting off the reflectivity challenges in visual reconstruction. A polygonal surface modeling scheme is further integrated to accurately delineate complex building boundaries, enhancing the reconstruction granularity. To avoid excessively accurate reconstruction, reprojected point cloud multi-plane fitting and two complexity control strategies are proposed, thus improving upon multipath estimation speed. Experiments were conducted in Lujiazui, Shanghai, a typical multipath-prone district. The results show that the method achieves an average reconstruction accuracy of 2.4 meters in dense urban environments featuring glass curtain wall structures, a traditionally tough case for reconstruction, and achieves a ray-tracing-based multipath correction rate of 30 image frames per second, 10 times faster than the contemporary benchmarks.

Title: Performance Analysis of IEEE 802.11bn Non-Primary Channel Access
Authors: Boris Bellalta, Francesc Wilhelmi, Lorenzo Galati-Giordano, Giovanni Geraci
Abstract: This paper presents a performance analysis of the Non-Primary Channel Access (NPCA) mechanism, a new feature introduced in IEEE 802.11bn to enhance spectrum utilization in Wi-Fi networks. NPCA enables devices to contend for and transmit on the secondary channel when the primary channel is occupied by transmissions from an Overlapping Basic Service Set (OBSS). We develop a Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) model that captures the interactions among OBSSs in dense WLAN environments when NPCA is enabled, incorporating new NPCA-specific states and transitions. In addition to the analytical insights offered by the model, we conduct numerical evaluations and simulations to quantify NPCA's impact on throughput and channel access delay across various scenarios. Our results show that NPCA can significantly improve throughput and reduce access delays in favorable conditions for BSSs that support the mechanism. Moreover, NPCA helps mitigate the OBSS performance anomaly, where low-rate OBSS transmissions degrade network performance for all nearby devices. However, we also observe trade-offs: NPCA may increase contention on secondary channels, potentially reducing transmission opportunities for BSSs operating there.

For the validation, we implement our prototype using the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense microcontroller board. This microcontroller board is specifically designed for IoT and AI applications, making it an ideal choice for our target use case scenarios. While most existing research focuses on a limited set of keywords, our model can process 23 different keywords, enabling complex commands.

Title: Mass-Adaptive Admittance Control for Robotic Manipulators
Authors: Hossein Gholampour, Jonathon E. Slightam, Logan E. Beaver
Abstract: Handling objects with unknown or changing masses is a common challenge in robotics, often leading to errors or instability if the control system cannot adapt in real-time. In this paper, we present a novel approach that enables a six-degrees-of-freedom robotic manipulator to reliably follow waypoints while automatically estimating and compensating for unknown payload weight. Our method integrates an admittance control framework with a mass estimator, allowing the robot to dynamically update an excitation force to compensate for the payload mass. This strategy mitigates end-effector sagging and preserves stability when handling objects of unknown weights. We experimentally validated our approach in a challenging pick-and-place task on a shelf with a crossbar, improved accuracy in reaching waypoints and compliant motion compared to a baseline admittance-control scheme. By safely accommodating unknown payloads, our work enhances flexibility in robotic automation and represents a significant step forward in adaptive control for uncertain environments.

Title: Using Phonemes in cascaded S2S translation pipeline
Authors: Rene Pilz, Johannes Schneider
Abstract: This paper explores the idea of using phonemes as a textual representation within a conventional multilingual simultaneous speech-to-speech translation pipeline, as opposed to the traditional reliance on text-based language representations. To investigate this, we trained an open-source sequence-to-sequence model on the WMT17 dataset in two formats: one using standard textual representation and the other employing phonemic representation. The performance of both approaches was assessed using the BLEU metric. Our findings shows that the phonemic approach provides comparable quality but offers several advantages, including lower resource requirements or better suitability for low-resource languages.

Title: Vision Controlled Orthotic Hand Exoskeleton
Authors: Connor Blais, Md Abdul Baset Sarker, Masudul H. Imtiaz
Abstract: This paper presents the design and implementation of an AI vision-controlled orthotic hand exoskeleton to enhance rehabilitation and assistive functionality for individuals with hand mobility impairments. The system leverages a Google Coral Dev Board Micro with an Edge TPU to enable real-time object detection using a customized MobileNet\_V2 model trained on a six-class dataset. The exoskeleton autonomously detects objects, estimates proximity, and triggers pneumatic actuation for grasp-and-release tasks, eliminating the need for user-specific calibration needed in traditional EMG-based systems. The design prioritizes compactness, featuring an internal battery. It achieves an 8-hour runtime with a 1300 mAh battery. Experimental results demonstrate a 51ms inference speed, a significant improvement over prior iterations, though challenges persist in model robustness under varying lighting conditions and object orientations. While the most recent YOLO model (YOLOv11) showed potential with 15.4 FPS performance, quantization issues hindered deployment. The prototype underscores the viability of vision-controlled exoskeletons for real-world assistive applications, balancing portability, efficiency, and real-time responsiveness, while highlighting future directions for model optimization and hardware miniaturization.

Title: Eigendecomposition Parameterization of Penalty Matrices for Enhanced Control Design: Aerospace Applications
Authors: Nicholas P. Nurre, Ehsan Taheri
Abstract: Modern control algorithms require tuning of square weight/penalty matrices appearing in quadratic functions/costs to improve performance and/or stability output. Due to simplicity in gain-tuning and enforcing positive-definiteness, diagonal penalty matrices are used extensively in control methods such as linear quadratic regulator (LQR), model predictive control, and Lyapunov-based control. In this paper, we propose an eigendecomposition approach to parameterize penalty matrices, allowing positive-definiteness with non-zero off-diagonal entries to be implicitly satisfied, which not only offers notable computational and implementation advantages, but broadens the class of achievable controls. We solve three control problems: 1) a variation of Zermelo's navigation problem, 2) minimum-energy spacecraft attitude control using both LQR and Lyapunov-based methods, and 3) minimum-fuel and minimum-time Lyapunov-based low-thrust trajectory design. Particle swarm optimization is used to optimize the decision variables, which will parameterize the penalty matrices. The results demonstrate improvements of up to 65% in the performance objective in the example problems utilizing the proposed method.

Title: Fast Online Adaptive Neural MPC via Meta-Learning
Authors: Yu Mei, Xinyu Zhou, Shuyang Yu, Vaibhav Srivastava, Xiaobo Tan
Abstract: Data-driven model predictive control (MPC) has demonstrated significant potential for improving robot control performance in the presence of model uncertainties. However, existing approaches often require extensive offline data collection and computationally intensive training, limiting their ability to adapt online. To address these challenges, this paper presents a fast online adaptive MPC framework that leverages neural networks integrated with Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Our approach focuses on few-shot adaptation of residual dynamics - capturing the discrepancy between nominal and true system behavior - using minimal online data and gradient steps. By embedding these meta-learned residual models into a computationally efficient L4CasADi-based MPC pipeline, the proposed method enables rapid model correction, enhances predictive accuracy, and improves real-time control performance. We validate the framework through simulation studies on a Van der Pol oscillator, a Cart-Pole system, and a 2D quadrotor. Results show significant gains in adaptation speed and prediction accuracy over both nominal MPC and nominal MPC augmented with a freshly initialized neural network, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach for real-time adaptive robot control.

Title: Assessing the Feasibility of Internet-Sourced Video for Automatic Cattle Lameness Detection
Authors: Md Fahimuzzman Sohan
Abstract: Cattle lameness is often caused by hoof injuries or interdigital dermatitis, leads to pain and significantly impacts essential physiological activities such as walking, feeding, and drinking. This study presents a deep learning-based model for detecting cattle lameness, sickness, or gait abnormalities using publicly available video data. The dataset consists of 50 unique videos from 40 individual cattle, recorded from various angles in both indoor and outdoor environments. Half of the dataset represents naturally walking (normal/non-lame) cattle, while the other half consists of cattle exhibiting gait abnormalities (lame). To enhance model robustness and generalizability, data augmentation was applied to the training data. The pre-processed videos were then classified using two deep learning models: ConvLSTM2D and 3D CNN. A comparative analysis of the results demonstrates strong classification performance. Specifically, the 3D CNN model achieved a video-level classification accuracy of 90%, with precision, recall, and f1-score of 90.9%, 90.9%, and 90.91% respectively. The ConvLSTM2D model exhibited a slightly lower accuracy of 85%. This study highlights the effectiveness of directly applying classification models to learn spatiotemporal features from video data, offering an alternative to traditional multi-stage approaches that typically involve object detection, pose estimation, and feature extraction. Besides, the findings demonstrate that the proposed deep learning models, particularly the 3D CNN, effectively classify and detect lameness in cattle while simplifying the processing pipeline.

Title: Revisiting Regret Benchmarks in Online Non-Stochastic Control
Authors: Vijeth Hebbar, Cédric Langbort
Abstract: In the online non-stochastic control problem, an agent sequentially selects control inputs for a linear dynamical system when facing unknown and adversarially selected convex costs and disturbances. A common metric for evaluating control policies in this setting is policy regret, defined relative to the best-in-hindsight linear feedback controller. However, for general convex costs, this benchmark may be less meaningful since linear controllers can be highly suboptimal. To address this, we introduce an alternative, more suitable benchmark--the performance of the best fixed input. We show that this benchmark can be viewed as a natural extension of the standard benchmark used in online convex optimization and propose a novel online control algorithm that achieves sublinear regret with respect to this new benchmark. We also discuss the connections between our method and the original one proposed by Agarwal et al. in their seminal work introducing the online non-stochastic control problem, and compare the performance of both approaches through numerical simulations.

Title: Non-linearity Effect Analysis of Gaussian Pulse Propagation In Optical Fiber
Authors: Yogesh Deo, Meenu Shrestha, Om Nath Acharya
Abstract: In this research, numerical analysis of nonlinear pulse propagation is carried out. This is done mainly by solving the nonlinear Schrodinger equation using the split step algorithm. In a nonlinear media, dispersive effects exist simultaneously with nonlinear effects. Refractive index dependence on intensity results in optical Kerr effect which causes narrowing of transmitted pulses by inducing self-phase modulation while second order group velocity dispersion causes the pulses to spread. In this project, group velocity dispersion is discussed followed by self-phase modulation. These individually detrimental effects are shown to combine beneficially for propagation of pulses here. Gaussian pulse is studied and propagated by using them as input in to the nonlinear Schrodinger equation. The split step algorithm is described in depth. Explanation of each step is included along with the relevant equations defining these steps.

Title: A Statistical Evaluation of Indoor LoRaWAN Environment-Aware Propagation for 6G: MLR, ANOVA, and Residual Distribution Analysis
Authors: Nahshon Mokua, Obiri, Kristof, Van Laerhoven
Abstract: Modeling path loss in indoor LoRaWAN technology deployments is inherently challenging due to structural obstructions, occupant density and activities, and fluctuating environmental conditions. This study proposes a two-stage approach to capture and analyze these complexities using an extensive dataset of 1,328,334 field measurements collected over six months in a single-floor office at the University of Siegen's Hoelderlinstrasse Campus, Germany. First, we implement a multiple linear regression model that includes traditional propagation metrics (distance, structural walls) and an extension with proposed environmental variables (relative humidity, temperature, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, and barometric pressure). Using analysis of variance, we demonstrate that adding these environmental factors can reduce unexplained variance by 42.32 percent. Secondly, we examine residual distributions by fitting five candidate probability distributions: Normal, Skew-Normal, Cauchy, Student's t, and Gaussian Mixture Models with one to five components. Our results show that a four-component Gaussian Mixture Model captures the residual heterogeneity of indoor signal propagation most accurately, significantly outperforming single-distribution approaches. Given the push toward ultra-reliable, context-aware communications in 6G networks, our analysis shows that environment-aware modeling can substantially improve LoRaWAN network design in dynamic indoor IoT deployments.

Title: Zero-shot Sim-to-Real Transfer for Reinforcement Learning-based Visual Servoing of Soft Continuum Arms
Authors: Hsin-Jung Yang, Mahsa Khosravi, Benjamin Walt, Girish Krishnan, Soumik Sarkar
Abstract: Soft continuum arms (SCAs) soft and deformable nature presents challenges in modeling and control due to their infinite degrees of freedom and non-linear behavior. This work introduces a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for visual servoing tasks on SCAs with zero-shot sim-to-real transfer capabilities, demonstrated on a single section pneumatic manipulator capable of bending and twisting. The framework decouples kinematics from mechanical properties using an RL kinematic controller for motion planning and a local controller for actuation refinement, leveraging minimal sensing with visual feedback. Trained entirely in simulation, the RL controller achieved a 99.8% success rate. When deployed on hardware, it achieved a 67% success rate in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, demonstrating robustness and adaptability. This approach offers a scalable solution for SCAs in 3D visual servoing, with potential for further refinement and expanded applications.

Title: Meta-Learning Online Dynamics Model Adaptation in Off-Road Autonomous Driving
Authors: Jacob Levy, Jason Gibson, Bogdan Vlahov, Erica Tevere, Evangelos Theodorou, David Fridovich-Keil, Patrick Spieler
Abstract: High-speed off-road autonomous driving presents unique challenges due to complex, evolving terrain characteristics and the difficulty of accurately modeling terrain-vehicle interactions. While dynamics models used in model-based control can be learned from real-world data, they often struggle to generalize to unseen terrain, making real-time adaptation essential. We propose a novel framework that combines a Kalman filter-based online adaptation scheme with meta-learned parameters to address these challenges. Offline meta-learning optimizes the basis functions along which adaptation occurs, as well as the adaptation parameters, while online adaptation dynamically adjusts the onboard dynamics model in real time for model-based control. We validate our approach through extensive experiments, including real-world testing on a full-scale autonomous off-road vehicle, demonstrating that our method outperforms baseline approaches in prediction accuracy, performance, and safety metrics, particularly in safety-critical scenarios. Our results underscore the effectiveness of meta-learned dynamics model adaptation, advancing the development of reliable autonomous systems capable of navigating diverse and unseen environments.

Title: Deep Anatomical Federated Network (Dafne): An open client-server framework for the continuous, collaborative improvement of deep learning-based medical image segmentation
Authors: Francesco Santini, Jakob Wasserthal, Abramo Agosti, Xeni Deligianni, Kevin R. Keene, Hermien E. Kan, Stefan Sommer, Fengdan Wang, Claudia Weidensteiner, Giulia Manco, Matteo Paoletti, Valentina Mazzoli, Arjun Desai, Anna Pichiecchio
Abstract: Purpose: To present and evaluate Dafne (deep anatomical federated network), a freely available decentralized, collaborative deep learning system for the semantic segmentation of radiological images through federated incremental learning. Materials and Methods: Dafne is free software with a client-server architecture. The client side is an advanced user interface that applies the deep learning models stored on the server to the user's data and allows the user to check and refine the prediction. Incremental learning is then performed at the client's side and sent back to the server, where it is integrated into the root model. Dafne was evaluated locally, by assessing the performance gain across model generations on 38 MRI datasets of the lower legs, and through the analysis of real-world usage statistics (n = 639 use-cases). Results: Dafne demonstrated a statistically improvement in the accuracy of semantic segmentation over time (average increase of the Dice Similarity Coefficient by 0.007 points/generation on the local validation set, p < 0.001). Qualitatively, the models showed enhanced performance on various radiologic image types, including those not present in the initial training sets, indicating good model generalizability. Conclusion: Dafne showed improvement in segmentation quality over time, demonstrating potential for learning and generalization.

Abstract: The accurate and timely diagnosis of acute aortic syndromes (AAS) in patients presenting with acute chest pain remains a clinical challenge. Aortic CT angiography (CTA) is the imaging protocol of choice in patients with suspected AAS. However, due to economic and workflow constraints in China, the majority of suspected patients initially undergo non-contrast CT as the initial imaging testing, and CTA is reserved for those at higher risk. In this work, we present an artificial intelligence-based warning system, iAorta, using non-contrast CT for AAS identification in China, which demonstrates remarkably high accuracy and provides clinicians with interpretable warnings. iAorta was evaluated through a comprehensive step-wise study. In the multi-center retrospective study (n = 20,750), iAorta achieved a mean area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.958 (95% CI 0.950-0.967). In the large-scale real-world study (n = 137,525), iAorta demonstrated consistently high performance across various non-contrast CT protocols, achieving a sensitivity of 0.913-0.942 and a specificity of 0.991-0.993. In the prospective comparative study (n = 13,846), iAorta demonstrated the capability to significantly shorten the time to correct diagnostic pathway. For the prospective pilot deployment that we conducted, iAorta correctly identified 21 out of 22 patients with AAS among 15,584 consecutive patients presenting with acute chest pain and under non-contrast CT protocol in the emergency department (ED) and enabled the average diagnostic time of these 21 AAS positive patients to be 102.1 (75-133) mins. Last, the iAorta can help avoid delayed or missed diagnosis of AAS in settings where non-contrast CT remains the unavoidable the initial or only imaging test in resource-constrained regions and in patients who cannot or did not receive intravenous contrast.

Title: Friedkin-Johnsen Model with Diminishing Competition
Authors: Luca Ballotta, Áron Vékássy, Stephanie Gil, Michal Yemini
Abstract: This letter studies the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) model with diminishing competition, or stubbornness. The original FJ model assumes that each agent assigns a constant competition weight to its initial opinion. In contrast, we investigate the effect of diminishing competition on the convergence point and speed of the FJ dynamics. We prove that, if the competition is uniform across agents and vanishes asymptotically, the convergence point coincides with the nominal consensus reached with no competition. However, the diminishing competition slows down convergence according to its own rate of decay. We study this phenomenon analytically and provide upper and lower bounds on the convergence rate. Further, if competition is not uniform across agents, we show that the convergence point may not coincide with the nominal consensus point. Finally, we evaluate our analytical insights numerically.

Title: Combining Physics-based and Data-driven Modeling for Building Energy Systems
Authors: Leandro Von Krannichfeldt, Kristina Orehounig, Olga Fink
Abstract: Building energy modeling plays a vital role in optimizing the operation of building energy systems by providing accurate predictions of the building's real-world conditions. In this context, various techniques have been explored, ranging from traditional physics-based models to data-driven models. Recently, researchers are combining physics-based and data-driven models into hybrid approaches. This includes using the physics-based model output as additional data-driven input, learning the residual between physics-based model and real data, learning a surrogate of the physics-based model, or fine-tuning a surrogate model with real data. However, a comprehensive comparison of the inherent advantages of these hybrid approaches is still missing. The primary objective of this work is to evaluate four predominant hybrid approaches in building energy modeling through a real-world case study, with focus on indoor thermodynamics. To achieve this, we devise three scenarios reflecting common levels of building documentation and sensor availability, assess their performance, and analyze their explainability using hierarchical Shapley values. The real-world study reveals three notable findings. First, greater building documentation and sensor availability lead to higher prediction accuracy for hybrid approaches. Second, the performance of hybrid approaches depends on the type of building room, but the residual approach using a Feedforward Neural Network as data-driven sub-model performs best on average across all rooms. This hybrid approach also demonstrates a superior ability to leverage the simulation from the physics-based sub-model. Third, hierarchical Shapley values prove to be an effective tool for explaining and improving hybrid models while accounting for input correlations.

Title: A Novel Adaptive Hybrid Focal-Entropy Loss for Enhancing Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks
Authors: Santhosh Malarvannan, Pandiyaraju V, Shravan Venkatraman, Abeshek A, Priyadarshini B, Kannan A
Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness around the world and demands precise AI-based diagnostic tools. Traditional loss functions in multi-class classification, such as Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE), are very common but break down with class imbalance, especially in cases with inherently challenging or overlapping classes, which leads to biased and less sensitive models. Since a heavy imbalance exists in the number of examples for higher severity stage 4 diabetic retinopathy, etc., classes compared to those very early stages like class 0, achieving class balance is key. For this purpose, we propose the Adaptive Hybrid Focal-Entropy Loss which combines the ideas of focal loss and entropy loss with adaptive weighting in order to focus on minority classes and highlight the challenging samples. The state-of-the art models applied for diabetic retinopathy detection with AHFE revealed good performance improvements, indicating the top performances of ResNet50 at 99.79%, DenseNet121 at 98.86%, Xception at 98.92%, MobileNetV2 at 97.84%, and InceptionV3 at 93.62% accuracy. This sheds light into how AHFE promotes enhancement in AI-driven diagnostics for complex and imbalanced medical datasets.

Title: Robust multi-coil MRI reconstruction via self-supervised denoising
Authors: Asad Aali, Marius Arvinte, Sidharth Kumar, Yamin I. Arefeen, Jonathan I. Tamir
Abstract: We study the effect of incorporating self-supervised denoising as a pre-processing step for training deep learning (DL) based reconstruction methods on data corrupted by Gaussian noise. K-space data employed for training are typically multi-coil and inherently noisy. Although DL-based reconstruction methods trained on fully sampled data can enable high reconstruction quality, obtaining large, noise-free datasets is impractical. We leverage Generalized Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (GSURE) for denoising. We evaluate two DL-based reconstruction methods: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) and Model-Based Deep Learning (MoDL). We evaluate the impact of denoising on the performance of these DL-based methods in solving accelerated multi-coil magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction. The experiments were carried out on T2-weighted brain and fat-suppressed proton-density knee scans. We observed that self-supervised denoising enhances the quality and efficiency of MRI reconstructions across various scenarios. Specifically, employing denoised images rather than noisy counterparts when training DL networks results in lower normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE), higher structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) across different SNR levels, including 32dB, 22dB, and 12dB for T2-weighted brain data, and 24dB, 14dB, and 4dB for fat-suppressed knee data. Overall, we showed that denoising is an essential pre-processing technique capable of improving the efficacy of DL-based MRI reconstruction methods under diverse conditions. By refining the quality of input data, denoising enables training more effective DL networks, potentially bypassing the need for noise-free reference MRI scans.

Title: Physics-based battery model parametrisation from impedance data
Authors: Noël Hallemans, Nicola E. Courtier, Colin P. Please, Brady Planden, Rishit Dhoot, Robert Timms, S. Jon chapman, David Howey, Stephen R. Duncan
Abstract: Non-invasive parametrisation of physics-based battery models can be performed by fitting the model to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data containing features related to the different physical processes. However, this requires an impedance model to be derived, which may be complex to obtain analytically. We have developed the open-source software PyBaMM-EIS that provides a fast method to compute the impedance of any PyBaMM model at any operating point using automatic differentiation. Using PyBaMM-EIS, we investigate the impedance of the single particle model, single particle model with electrolyte (SPMe), and Doyle-Fuller-Newman model, and identify the SPMe as a parsimonious option that shows the typical features of measured lithium-ion cell impedance data. We provide a grouped parameter SPMe and analyse the features in the impedance related to each parameter. Using the open-source software PyBOP, we estimate 18 grouped parameters both from simulated impedance data and from measured impedance data from a LG M50LT lithium-ion battery. The parameters that directly affect the response of the SPMe can be accurately determined and assigned to the correct electrode. Crucially, parameter fitting must be done simultaneously to data across a wide range of states-of-charge. Overall, this work presents a practical way to find the parameters of physics-based models.

Title: Semantic Communication with Entropy-and-Channel-Adaptive Rate Control over Multi-User MIMO Fading Channels
Authors: Weixuan Chen, Qianqian Yang, Yuhao Chen, Chongwen Huang, Qian Wang, Zehui Xiong, Zhaoyang Zhang
Abstract: Although significant improvements in transmission efficiency have been achieved, existing semantic communication (SemCom) methods typically use a fixed transmission rate for varying channel conditions and transmission contents, leading to performance degradation under harsh channel conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel SemCom method for wireless image transmission that integrates entropy-andchannel-adaptive rate control mechanism, specifically designed for multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) fading channels. Unlike existing methods, our system dynamically adjusts transmission rates by leveraging the entropy of feature maps, channel state information (CSI), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), ensuring optimal communication resource usage. It incorporates feature map pruning, channel attention, spatial attention, and multi-head self-attention (MHSA) to effectively prioritize critical semantic features while minimizing unnecessary transmission overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms separated source and channel coding and deep joint source and channel coding (Deep JSCC), in terms of rate-distortion performance, flexibility, and robustness, particularly in challenging scenarios such as low SNR, imperfect CSI, and inter-user interference.

Title: Towards Routing and Edge Computing in Satellite-Terrestrial Networks: A Column Generation Approach
Authors: Yuan Liao, Kan Cheng, Fan Lu, Hao Jin, Zhaohui Yang
Abstract: Edge computing that enables satellites to process raw data locally is expected to bring further timeliness and flexibility to satellite-terrestrial networks (STNs). In this letter, we propose a three-layer edge computing protocol, where raw data collected by the satellites can be processed locally, or transmitted to other satellites or the ground station via multi-hop routing for further processing. The overall computing capacity of the proposed framework is maximized by determining the offloading strategy and routing formation, subject to channel capacity and hop constraints. Given that the problem scale grows exponentially with the number of satellites and maximum-allowed hops, the column generation approach is employed to obtain the global optimal solution by activating only a subset of variables. Numerical results reveal that the proposed three-layer computing protocol, when tolerating a 5-hop routing latency, achieves a 60% improvement in computation capacity compared to the single-layer local computing configuration.

Title: Finite Sample Analysis of System Poles for Ho-Kalman Algorithm
Authors: Shuai Sun, Xu Wang
Abstract: This paper investigates the error analysis of system pole estimation in $n$-dimensional discrete-time Linear Time-Invariant systems with $m$ outputs and $p$ inputs, using the classical Ho-Kalman algorithm based on finite input-output sample data. Building upon prior work, we establish end-to-end estimation guarantees for system poles under both single-trajectory and multiple-trajectory settings. Specifically, we prove that, with high probability, the estimation error of system poles decreases at a rate of at least $\mathcal{O}\{T^{-\frac{1}{2n}}\}$ in the single-trajectory case and $\mathcal{O}\{N^{-\frac{1}{2n}}\}$ in the multiple-trajectory case, where $T$ is the length of a single trajectory, and $N$ is the number of trajectories. Furthermore, we reveal that in both settings, achieving a constant estimation accuracy for system poles requires the sample size to grow super-polynomially with respect to the larger of the two ratios, $ \max\{n/m, n/p\} $. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the non-asymptotic results of system pole estimation.

Title: Application of Battery Storage to Switching Predictive Control of Power Distribution Systems Including Road Heating
Authors: Chiaki Kojima, Yuya Muto, Hikaru Akutsu, Rinnosuke Shima, Yoshihiko Susuki
Abstract: In regions with heavy snowfall, the living environment is becoming a serious problem due to heavy snow accumulation. A road heating is an electrical device which promotes snow melting by burying a heating cable as a thermal source underground in such regions. When integrating the road heating into power distribution systems, we need to optimize the flow of electric power by appropriately integrating distributed power sources and conventional power distribution equipment. In this paper, we introduce a battery storage to the power distribution system including road heating, and extend the predictive switching control of the systems due to the authors' previous study to the case where battery storage is installed. As a main result, we propose a predictive switching control that utilizes photovoltaic (PV) power generation and surplus power stored in the battery storage effectively, and achieves the reduction of distribution loss, attenuation of voltage fluctuation, and efficient snow melting, simultaneously. We verify the effectiveness of the application of battery storage through numerical simulation using actual time series data of weather conditions and active power of the PV power generation and load.

Title: Distributed Model Predictive Control for Dynamic Cooperation of Multi-Agent Systems
Authors: Matthias Köhler, Matthias A. Müller, Frank Allgöwer
Abstract: We propose a distributed model predictive control (MPC) framework for coordinating heterogeneous, nonlinear multi-agent systems under individual and coupling constraints. The cooperative task is encoded as a shared objective function minimized collectively by the agents. Each agent optimizes an artificial reference as an intermediate step towards the cooperative objective, along with a control input to track it. We establish recursive feasibility, asymptotic stability, and transient performance bounds under suitable assumptions. The solution to the cooperative task is not predetermined but emerges from the optimized interactions of the agents. We demonstrate the framework on numerical examples inspired by satellite constellation control, collision-free narrow-passage traversal, and coordinated quadrotor flight.

Title: How Cyclic Acoustic Patterns Influence ASMR Perception: A Signal Processing Perspective
Authors: Zexin Fang, Bin Han, Henrik H. Sveen, C. Clark Cao, Hans D. Schotten
Abstract: Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) has been remarkably popular in the recent decade. While its effect has been validated through behavioral studies and neuro-physiological measurements such as electroencephalography (EEG) and related bio-signal analyses, its development and triggers remain a subject of debate. Previous studies suggest that its triggers are highly linked with cyclic patterns: predictable patterns introduce relaxation while variations maintain intrigue. To validate this and further understand the impact of acoustic features on ASMR effects, we designed three distinct cyclic patterns with monophonic and stereophonic variations, while controlling their predictability and randomness, and collected ASMR triggering scores through online surveys. Then, we extracted cyclic features and carried out regression analysis, seeking an explainable mapping of cyclic features and ASMR triggers. We found that relaxing effects accumulate progressively and are independent of spatial orientation. Cyclic patterns significantly influence psychological and physical effects, which remain invariant with time. Regression analysis revealed that smoothly spread and energy-dense cyclic patterns most effectively trigger ASMR responses.

Title: Successive Jump and Mode Decomposition
Authors: Mojtaba Nazari, Anders Rosendal Korshøj, Naveed ur Rehman
Abstract: We propose fully data-driven variational methods, termed successive jump and mode decomposition (SJMD) and its multivariate extension, successive multivariate jump and mode decomposition (SMJMD), for successively decomposing nonstationary signals into amplitude- and frequency-modulated (AM-FM) oscillations and jump components. Unlike existing methods that treat oscillatory modes and jump discontinuities separately and often require prior knowledge of the number of components (K) -- which is difficult to obtain in practice -- our approaches employ successive optimization-based schemes that jointly handle AM-FM oscillations and jump discontinuities without the need to predefine K. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithms offer superior accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Rotatable Antenna-Enabled Secure Wireless Communication
Authors: Liang Dai, Beixiong Zheng, Qingjie Wu, Changsheng You, Robert Schober, Rui Zhang
Abstract: Rotatable antenna (RA) is a promising technology that exploits new spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) to improve wireless communication and sensing performance. In this letter, we investigate an RA-enabled secure communication system where confidential information is transmitted from an RA-based access point (AP) to a single-antenna legitimate user in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. We aim to maximize the achievable secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and the deflection angles of all RAs. Accordingly, we propose an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution in an iterative manner, where generalized Rayleigh quotient-based beamforming is applied and the RAs' deflection angles are optimized by the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. Our simulation results show that the proposed RA-enabled secure communication system achieves a significantly higher achievable secrecy rate as compared to various benchmark schemes.

Title: Learned enclosure method for experimental EIT data
Authors: Sara Sippola, Siiri Rautio, Andreas Hauptmann, Takanori Ide, Samuli Siltanen
Abstract: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive imaging method with diverse applications, including medical imaging and non-destructive testing. The inverse problem of reconstructing internal electrical conductivity from boundary measurements is nonlinear and highly ill-posed, making it difficult to solve accurately. In recent years, there has been growing interest in combining analytical methods with machine learning to solve inverse problems. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating the convex hull of inclusions from boundary measurements by combining the enclosure method proposed by Ikehata with neural networks. We demonstrate its performance using experimental data. Compared to the classical enclosure method with least squares fitting, the learned convex hull achieves superior performance on both simulated and experimental data.

Title: Putting the Segment Anything Model to the Test with 3D Knee MRI -- A Comparison with State-of-the-Art Performance
Authors: Oliver Mills, Philip Conaghan, Nishant Ravikumar, Samuel Relton
Abstract: Menisci are cartilaginous tissue found within the knee that contribute to joint lubrication and weight dispersal. Damage to menisci can lead to onset and progression of knee osteoarthritis (OA), a condition that is a leading cause of disability, and for which there are few effective therapies. Accurate automated segmentation of menisci would allow for earlier detection and treatment of meniscal abnormalities, as well as shedding more light on the role the menisci play in OA pathogenesis. Focus in this area has mainly used variants of convolutional networks, but there has been no attempt to utilise recent large vision transformer segmentation models. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a so-called foundation segmentation model, which has been found useful across a range of different tasks due to the large volume of data used for training the model. In this study, SAM was adapted to perform fully-automated segmentation of menisci from 3D knee magnetic resonance images. A 3D U-Net was also trained as a baseline. It was found that, when fine-tuning only the decoder, SAM was unable to compete with 3D U-Net, achieving a Dice score of $0.81\pm0.03$, compared to $0.87\pm0.03$, on a held-out test set. When fine-tuning SAM end-to-end, a Dice score of $0.87\pm0.03$ was achieved. The performance of both the end-to-end trained SAM configuration and the 3D U-Net were comparable to the winning Dice score ($0.88\pm0.03$) in the IWOAI Knee MRI Segmentation Challenge 2019. Performance in terms of the Hausdorff Distance showed that both configurations of SAM were inferior to 3D U-Net in matching the meniscus morphology. Results demonstrated that, despite its generalisability, SAM was unable to outperform a basic 3D U-Net in meniscus segmentation, and may not be suitable for similar 3D medical image segmentation tasks also involving fine anatomical structures with low contrast and poorly-defined boundaries.

Title: Tightening Quadratic Convex Relaxations for the AC Optimal Transmission Switching Problem
Authors: Cheng Guo, Harsha Nagarajan, Merve Bodur
Abstract: The Alternating Current Optimal Transmission Switching (ACOTS) problem incorporates line switching decisions into the AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) framework, offering well-known benefits in reducing operational costs and enhancing system reliability. ACOTS optimization models contain discrete variables and nonlinear, non-convex constraints, which make it difficult to solve. In this work, we develop strengthened quadratic convex (QC) relaxations for ACOTS, where we tighten the relaxation with several new valid inequalities, including a novel kind of on/off cycle-based polynomial constraints by taking advantage of the network structure. We linearize the sum of on/off trilinear terms in the relaxation using extreme-point representation, demonstrating theoretical tightness, and efficiently incorporate on/off cycle-based polynomial constraints through disjunctive programming-based cutting planes. Combined with an optimization-based bound tightening algorithm, this results in the tightest QC-based ACOTS relaxation to date. We additionally propose a novel maximum spanning tree-based heuristic to improve the computational performance by fixing certain lines to be switched on. Our extensive numerical experiments on medium-scale PGLib instances show significant improvements on relaxation bounds, while tests on large-scale instances with up to 2,312 buses demonstrate substantial performance gains. To our knowledge, this is the first ACOTS relaxation-based approach to demonstrate near-optimal switching solutions on realistic large-scale power grid instances.

Title: Two-timescale joint power control and beamforming design with applications to cell-free massive MIMO
Authors: Lorenzo Miretti, Renato L. G. Cavalcante, Sławomir Stańczak
Abstract: In this study we derive novel optimal algorithms for joint power control and beamforming design in modern large-scale MIMO systems, such as those based on the cell-free massive MIMO and XL-MIMO concepts. In particular, motivated by the need for scalable system architectures, we formulate and solve nontrivial two-timescale extensions of the classical uplink power minimization and max-min fair resource allocation problems. In our formulations, we let the beamformers be functions mapping partial instantaneous channel state information (CSI) to beamforming weights, and we jointly optimize these functions and the power control coefficients based on long-term statistical CSI. This long-term approach mitigates the severe scalability issues of competing short-term iterative algorithms in the literature, where a central controller endowed with global instantaneous CSI must solve a complex optimization problem for every channel realization, hence imposing very demanding requirements in terms of computational complexity and signaling overhead. Moreover, our approach outperforms the available long-term approaches, which do not jointly optimize powers and beamformers. The obtained optimal long-term algorithms are then illustrated and compared against existing short-term and long-term algorithms via numerical simulations in a cell-free massive MIMO setup with different levels of cooperation.

Title: Coding for Gaussian Two-Way Channels: Linear and Learning-Based Approaches
Authors: Junghoon Kim, Taejoon Kim, Anindya Bijoy Das, Seyyedali Hosseinalipour, David J. Love, Christopher G. Brinton
Abstract: Although user cooperation cannot improve the capacity of Gaussian two-way channels (GTWCs) with independent noises, it can improve communication reliability. In this work, we aim to enhance and balance the communication reliability in GTWCs by minimizing the sum of error probabilities via joint design of encoders and decoders at the users. We first formulate general encoding/decoding functions, where the user cooperation is captured by the coupling of user encoding processes. The coupling effect renders the encoder/decoder design non-trivial, requiring effective decoding to capture this effect, as well as efficient power management at the encoders within power constraints. To address these challenges, we propose two different two-way coding strategies: linear coding and learning-based coding. For linear coding, we propose optimal linear decoding and discuss new insights on encoding regarding user cooperation to balance reliability. We then propose an efficient algorithm for joint encoder/decoder design. For learning-based coding, we introduce a novel recurrent neural network (RNN)-based coding architecture, where we propose interactive RNNs and a power control layer for encoding, and we incorporate bi-directional RNNs with an attention mechanism for decoding. Through simulations, we show that our two-way coding methodologies outperform conventional channel coding schemes (that do not utilize user cooperation) significantly in sum-error performance. We also demonstrate that our linear coding excels at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), while our RNN-based coding performs best at low SNRs. We further investigate our two-way coding strategies in terms of power distribution, two-way coding benefit, different coding rates, and block-length gain.

Title: Approximate solution of stochastic infinite horizon optimal control problems for constrained linear uncertain systems
Authors: Eunhyek Joa, Francesco Borrelli
Abstract: We propose a Model Predictive Control (MPC) with a single-step prediction horizon to approximate the solution of infinite horizon optimal control problems with the expected sum of convex stage costs for constrained linear uncertain systems. The proposed method aims to enhance a given sub-optimal controller, leveraging data to achieve a nearly optimal solution for the infinite horizon problem. The method is built on two techniques. First, we estimate the expected values of the convex costs using a computationally tractable approximation, achieved by sampling across the space of disturbances. Second, we implement a data-driven approach to approximate the optimal value function and its corresponding domain, through systematic exploration of the system's state space. These estimates are subsequently used to calculate the terminal cost and terminal set within the proposed MPC. We prove recursive feasibility, robust constraint satisfaction, and convergence in probability to the target set. Furthermore, we prove that the estimated value function converges to the optimal value function in a local region. The effectiveness of the proposed MPC is illustrated with detailed numerical simulations and comparisons with a value iteration method and a Learning MPC that minimizes a certainty equivalent cost.

Title: Neural Risk Limiting Dispatch in Power Networks: Formulation and Generalization Guarantees
Authors: Ge Chen, Junjie Qin
Abstract: Risk limiting dispatch (RLD) has been proposed as an approach that effectively trades off economic costs with operational risks for power dispatch under uncertainty. However, how to solve the RLD problem with provably near-optimal performance still remains an open problem. This paper presents a learning-based solution to this challenge. We first design a data-driven formulation for the RLD problem, which aims to construct a decision rule that directly maps day-ahead observable information to cost-effective dispatch decisions for the future delivery interval. Unlike most existing works that follow a predict-then-optimize paradigm, this end-to-end rule bypasses the additional suboptimality introduced by separately handling prediction and optimization. We then propose neural RLD, a novel solution method to the data-driven formulation. This method leverages an L2-regularized neural network to learn the decision rule, thereby transforming the data-driven formulation into a neural network training task that can be efficiently completed by stochastic gradient descent. A theoretical performance guarantee is further established to bound the suboptimality of our method, which implies that its suboptimality approaches zero with high probability as more samples are utilized. Simulation tests across various systems demonstrate our method's superior performance in convergence, suboptimality, and computational efficiency compared with benchmarks.

Title: Deep Learning for Low-Latency, Quantum-Ready RF Sensing
Authors: Pranav Gokhale, Caitlin Carnahan, William Clark, Teague Tomesh, Frederic T. Chong
Abstract: Recent work has shown the promise of applying deep learning to enhance software processing of radio frequency (RF) signals. In parallel, hardware developments with quantum RF sensors based on Rydberg atoms are breaking longstanding barriers in frequency range, resolution, and sensitivity. In this paper, we describe our implementations of quantum-ready machine learning approaches for RF signal classification. Our primary objective is latency: while deep learning offers a more powerful computational paradigm, it also traditionally incurs latency overheads that hinder wider scale deployment. Our work spans three axes. (1) A novel continuous wavelet transform (CWT) based recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that enables flexible online classification of RF signals on-the-fly with reduced sampling time.

Title: Adapting General Disentanglement-Based Speaker Anonymization for Enhanced Emotion Preservation
Authors: Xiaoxiao Miao, Yuxiang Zhang, Xin Wang, Natalia Tomashenko, Donny Cheng Lock Soh, Ian Mcloughlin
Abstract: A general disentanglement-based speaker anonymization system typically separates speech into content, speaker, and prosody features using individual encoders. This paper explores how to adapt such a system when a new speech attribute, for example, emotion, needs to be preserved to a greater extent. While existing systems are good at anonymizing speaker embeddings, they are not designed to preserve emotion. Two strategies for this are examined. First, we show that integrating emotion embeddings from a pre-trained emotion encoder can help preserve emotional cues, even though this approach slightly compromises privacy protection. Alternatively, we propose an emotion compensation strategy as a post-processing step applied to anonymized speaker embeddings. This conceals the original speaker's identity and reintroduces the emotional traits lost during speaker embedding anonymization. Specifically, we model the emotion attribute using support vector machines to learn separate boundaries for each emotion. During inference, the original speaker embedding is processed in two ways: one, by an emotion indicator to predict emotion and select the emotion-matched SVM accurately; and two, by a speaker anonymizer to conceal speaker characteristics. The anonymized speaker embedding is then modified along the corresponding SVM boundary towards an enhanced emotional direction to save the emotional cues. The proposed strategies are also expected to be useful for adapting a general disentanglement-based speaker anonymization system to preserve other target paralinguistic attributes, with potential for a range of downstream tasks.

Title: Pre-Chirp-Domain Index Modulation for Full-Diversity Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing towards 6G
Authors: Guangyao Liu, Tianqi Mao, Zhenyu Xiao, Miaowen Wen, Ruiqi Liu, Jingjing Zhao, Ertugrul Basar, Zhaocheng Wang, Sheng Chen
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM), tailored as a superior multicarrier technique utilizing chirp signals for high-mobility communications, is envisioned as a promising candidate for the sixth-generation (6G) wireless network. AFDM is based on the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) with two adjustable parameters of the chirp signals, termed as the pre-chirp and post-chirp parameters, respectively. We show that the pre-chirp counterpart can be flexibly manipulated for additional degree-of-freedom (DoF). Therefore, this paper proposes a novel AFDM scheme with the pre-chirp index modulation (PIM) philosophy (AFDM-PIM), which can implicitly convey extra information bits through dynamic pre-chirp parameter assignment, thus enhancing both spectral and energy efficiency. Specifically, we first demonstrate that the subcarrier orthogonality is still maintained by applying distinct pre-chirp parameters to various subcarriers in the AFDM modulation process. Inspired by this property, each AFDM subcarrier is constituted with a unique pre-chirp signal according to the incoming bits. By such arrangement, extra binary bits can be embedded into the index patterns of pre-chirp parameter assignment without additional energy consumption. For performance analysis, we derive the asymptotically tight upper bounds on the average bit error rates (BERs) of the proposed schemes with maximum-likelihood (ML) detection, and validate that the proposed AFDM-PIM can achieve the optimal diversity order under doubly dispersive channels. Based on the derivations, we further propose an optimal pre-chirp alphabet design to enhance the BER performance via intelligent optimization algorithms. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed AFDM-PIM outperforms the classical benchmarks under doubly dispersive channel.

Title: A Passivity Analysis for Nonlinear Consensus on Balanced Digraphs
Authors: Feng-Yu Yue, Daniel Zelazo
Abstract: This work deals with the output consensus problem for multiagent systems over balanced digraphs by passivity analysis. As the standard diffusive coupling structure only models the undirected interconnection, we propose a general approach capable of processing directed coupling and performing passivity analysis. To mitigate the complexity arising from the nonlinearity and directed interconnections, we reformulate the output consensus problem as a convergence analysis on a submanifold. We provide passivity analysis and establish a sufficient condition based on passivity for achieving output agreement in multi-agent systems over balanced digraphs. The results are supported by a numerical example.

Title: A Cardinality-Constrained Approach to Combinatorial Bilevel Congestion Pricing
Authors: Lei Guo, Jiayang Li, Yu Marco Nie, Jun Xie
Abstract: Combinatorial bilevel congestion pricing (CBCP), a variant of the mixed (continuous/discrete) network design problems, seeks to minimize the total travel time experienced by all travelers in a road network, by strategically selecting toll locations and determining toll charges. Conventional wisdom suggests that these problems are intractable since they have to be formulated and solved with a significant number of integer variables. Here, we devise a scalable local algorithm for the CBCP problem that guarantees convergence to an approximate Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point. Our approach is novel in that it eliminates the use of integer variables altogether, instead introducing a cardinality constraint that limits the number of toll locations to a user-specified upper bound. The resulting bilevel program with the cardinality constraint is then transformed into a block-separable, single-level optimization problem that can be solved efficiently after penalization and decomposition. We are able to apply the algorithm to solve, in about 20 minutes, a CBCP instance with up to 3,000 links. To the best of our knowledge, no existing algorithm can solve CBCP problems at such a scale while providing any assurance of convergence.

Title: Indirect Adaptive Control Using a Static Update Law
Authors: Tom Kaufmann, Johann Reger
Abstract: The update law in the indirect adaptive control scheme can be extended to include feedthrough of an error term. This reduces undesired oscillations of the calculated weights. When the ${\sigma}$-modification is used for achieving robustness against unstructured uncertainties, the gain of the feedthrough in the update law cannot be chosen arbitrarily. Compared to our previous result, we show stability of the closed loop for a larger parameter-range for the gain of the feedthrough in the update law. This parameter-range includes a configuration for which the influence of the integration in the update law diminishes over time, i.e. for which the adaptation for large times is governed solely by the feedthrough in the update law. By initializing at zero, this allows for removing the integration from the update law, resulting in a static update law. For the purely linear case, the adaptation acts like a disturbance observer. Frequency-domain analysis of the closed loop with a second order plant shows that removing the integration from the update law with ${\sigma}$-modification and feedthrough affects how precisely disturbances in the low-frequency band are observed. If the damping injected into the adaptation process by the ${\sigma}$-modification exceeds certain bounds, then the precision is increased by using the static update law.

Title: Dual NUP Representations and Min-Maximization in Factor Graphs
Authors: Yun-Peng Li, Hans-Andrea Loeliger
Abstract: Normals with unknown parameters (NUP) can be used to convert nontrivial model-based estimation problems into iterations of linear least-squares or Gaussian estimation problems. In this paper, we extend this approach by augmenting factor graphs with convex-dual variables and pertinent NUP representations. In particular, in a state space setting, we propose a new iterative forward-backward algorithm that is dual to a recently proposed backward-forward algorithm.

Title: Resolving quantitative MRI model degeneracy in self-supervised machine learning
Authors: Giulio V. Minore, Louis Dwyer-Hemmings, Timothy J.P. Bray, Hui Zhang
Abstract: Quantitative MRI (qMRI) estimates tissue properties of interest from measured MRI signals. This process is conventionally achieved by model fitting, whose computational expense limits qMRI's clinical use, motivating recent development of machine learning-based methods. Self-supervised approaches are particularly popular as they avoid the pitfall of distributional shift that affects supervised methods. However, it is unknown how such methods behave if similar signals can result from multiple tissue properties, a common challenge known as model degeneracy. Understanding this is crucial for ascertaining the scope within which self-supervised approaches may be applied. To this end, this work makes two contributions. First, we demonstrate that model degeneracy compromises self-supervised approaches, motivating the development of mitigation strategies. Second, we propose a mitigation strategy based on applying appropriate constraining transforms on the output of the bottleneck layer of the autoencoder network typically employed in self-supervised approaches. We illustrate both contributions using the estimation of proton density fat fraction and $R_2^*$ from chemical shift-encoded MRI, an ideal exemplar due to its exhibition of degeneracy across the full parameter space. The results from both simulation and $\textit{in vivo}$ experiments demonstrate that the proposed strategy helps resolve model degeneracy.

Title: AudioX: Diffusion Transformer for Anything-to-Audio Generation
Authors: Zeyue Tian, Yizhu Jin, Zhaoyang Liu, Ruibin Yuan, Xu Tan, Qifeng Chen, Wei Xue, Yike Guo
Abstract: Audio and music generation have emerged as crucial tasks in many applications, yet existing approaches face significant limitations: they operate in isolation without unified capabilities across modalities, suffer from scarce high-quality, multi-modal training data, and struggle to effectively integrate diverse inputs. In this work, we propose AudioX, a unified Diffusion Transformer model for Anything-to-Audio and Music Generation. Unlike previous domain-specific models, AudioX can generate both general audio and music with high quality, while offering flexible natural language control and seamless processing of various modalities including text, video, image, music, and audio. Its key innovation is a multi-modal masked training strategy that masks inputs across modalities and forces the model to learn from masked inputs, yielding robust and unified cross-modal representations. To address data scarcity, we curate two comprehensive datasets: vggsound-caps with 190K audio captions based on the VGGSound dataset, and V2M-caps with 6 million music captions derived from the V2M dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AudioX not only matches or outperforms state-of-the-art specialized models, but also offers remarkable versatility in handling diverse input modalities and generation tasks within a unified architecture. The code and datasets will be available at this https URL

Title: The Price of Simplicity: Analyzing Decoupled Policies for Multi-Location Inventory Control
Authors: Yohan John, Vade Shah, James A. Preiss, Mahnoosh Alizadeh, Jason R. Marden
Abstract: What is the performance cost of using simple, decoupled control policies in inherently coupled systems? Motivated by industrial refrigeration systems, where centralized compressors exhibit economies of scale yet traditional control employs decoupled room-by-room temperature regulation, we address this question through the lens of multi-location inventory control. Here, a planner manages multiple inventories to meet stochastic demand while minimizing costs that are coupled through nonlinear ordering functions reflecting economies of scale. Our main contributions are: (i) a surprising equivalence result showing that optimal stationary base-stock levels for individual locations remain unchanged despite the coupling when restricting attention to decoupled strategies; (ii) tight performance bounds for simple decoupled policies relative to optimal coupled policies, revealing that the worst-case ratio depends primarily on the degree of nonlinearity in the cost function and scales with the number of locations for systems with fixed costs; and (iii) analysis of practical online algorithms that achieve competitive performance without solving complex dynamic programs. Numerical simulations demonstrate that while decoupled policies significantly outperform their worst-case guarantees in typical scenarios, they still exhibit meaningful suboptimality compared to fully coordinated strategies. These results provide actionable guidance for system operators navigating the trade-off between control complexity and operational efficiency in coupled systems.

Title: Feedback Stackelberg-Nash equilibria in difference games with quasi-hierarchical interactions and inequality constraints
Authors: Partha Sarathi Mohapatra, Puduru Viswanadha Reddy, Georges Zaccour
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of two-player deterministic finite-horizon difference games with coupled inequality constraints, where each player has two types of decision variables: one involving sequential interactions and the other simultaneous interactions. We refer to this class of games as quasi-hierarchical dynamic games and define a solution concept called the feedback Stackelberg-Nash (FSN) equilibrium. Under separability assumption on cost functions, we provide a recursive formulation of the FSN solution using dynamic programming. We show that the FSN solution can be derived from the parametric feedback Stackelberg solution of an associated unconstrained game involving only sequential interactions, with a specific choice of the parameters that satisfy certain implicit complementarity conditions. For the linear-quadratic case, we show that an FSN solution is obtained by reformulating these complementarity conditions as a single large-scale linear complementarity problem. Finally, we illustrate our results using a dynamic duopoly game with production constraints.

Title: SLAM-Based Navigation and Fault Resilience in a Surveillance Quadcopter with Embedded Vision Systems
Authors: Abhishek Tyagi, Charu Gaur
Abstract: We present an autonomous aerial surveillance platform, Veg, designed as a fault-tolerant quadcopter system that integrates visual SLAM for GPS-independent navigation, advanced control architecture for dynamic stability, and embedded vision modules for real-time object and face recognition. The platform features a cascaded control design with an LQR inner-loop and PD outer-loop trajectory control. It leverages ORB-SLAM3 for 6-DoF localization and loop closure, and supports waypoint-based navigation through Dijkstra path planning over SLAM-derived maps. A real-time Failure Detection and Identification (FDI) system detects rotor faults and executes emergency landing through re-routing. The embedded vision system, based on a lightweight CNN and PCA, enables onboard object detection and face recognition with high precision. The drone operates fully onboard using a Raspberry Pi 4 and Arduino Nano, validated through simulations and real-world testing. This work consolidates real-time localization, fault recovery, and embedded AI on a single platform suitable for constrained environments.
