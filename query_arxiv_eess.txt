Title: Empirical Studies of Large Scale Environment Scanning by Consumer Electronics
Authors: Mengyuan Wang, Yang Liu, Haopeng Wang, Haiwei Dong, Abdulmotaleb El Saddik
Abstract: This paper presents an empirical evaluation of the Matterport Pro3, a consumer-grade 3D scanning device, for large-scale environment reconstruction. We conduct detailed scanning (1,099 scanning points) of a six-floor building (17,567 square meters) and assess the device's effectiveness, limitations, and performance enhancements in diverse scenarios. Challenges encountered during the scanning are addressed through proposed solutions, while we also explore advanced methods to overcome them more effectively. Comparative analysis with another consumer-grade device (iPhone) highlights the Pro3's balance between cost-effectiveness and performance. The Matterport Pro3 achieves a denser point cloud with 1,877,324 points compared to the iPhone's 506,961 points and higher alignment accuracy with an RMSE of 0.0118 meters. The cloud-to-cloud (C2C) average distance error between the two point cloud models is 0.0408 meters, with a standard deviation of 0.0715 meters. The study demonstrates the Pro3's ability to generate high-quality 3D models suitable for large-scale applications, leveraging features such as LiDAR and advanced alignment techniques.

Title: Deploying and Evaluating Multiple Deep Learning Models on Edge Devices for Diabetic Retinopathy Detection
Authors: Akwasi Asare, Dennis Agyemanh Nana Gookyi, Derrick Boateng, Fortunatus Aabangbio Wulnye
Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of vision impairment in individuals with diabetes, affects approximately 34.6% of diabetes patients globally, with the number of cases projected to reach 242 million by 2045. Traditional DR diagnosis relies on the manual examination of retinal fundus images, which is both time-consuming and resource intensive. This study presents a novel solution using Edge Impulse to deploy multiple deep learning models for real-time DR detection on edge devices. A robust dataset of over 3,662 retinal fundus images, sourced from the Kaggle EyePACS dataset, was curated, and enhanced through preprocessing techniques, including augmentation and normalization. Using TensorFlow, various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom Deep Neural Network (DNN), were designed, trained, and optimized for edge deployment. The models were converted to TensorFlowLite and quantized to 8-bit integers to reduce their size and enhance inference speed, with minimal trade-offs in accuracy. Performance evaluations across different edge hardware platforms, including smartphones and microcontrollers, highlighted key metrics such as inference speed, accuracy, precision, and resource utilization. MobileNet achieved an accuracy of 96.45%, while SqueezeNet demonstrated strong real-time performance with a small model size of 176 KB and latency of just 17 ms on GPU. ShuffleNet and the custom DNN achieved moderate accuracy but excelled in resource efficiency, making them suitable for lower-end devices. This integration of edge AI technology into healthcare presents a scalable, cost-effective solution for early DR detection, providing timely and accurate diagnosis, especially in resource-constrained and remote healthcare settings.

Title: Improving Prostate Gland Segmenting Using Transformer based Architectures
Authors: Shatha Abudalou
Abstract: Inter reader variability and cross site domain shift challenge the automatic segmentation of prostate anatomy using T2 weighted MRI images. This study investigates whether transformer models can retain precision amid such heterogeneity. We compare the performance of UNETR and SwinUNETR in prostate gland segmentation against our previous 3D UNet model [1], based on 546 MRI (T2weighted) volumes annotated by two independent experts. Three training strategies were analyzed: single cohort dataset, 5 fold cross validated mixed cohort, and gland size based dataset. Hyperparameters were tuned by Optuna. The test set, from an independent population of readers, served as the evaluation endpoint (Dice Similarity Coefficient). In single reader training, SwinUNETR achieved an average dice score of 0.816 for Reader#1 and 0.860 for Reader#2, while UNETR scored 0.8 and 0.833 for Readers #1 and #2, respectively, compared to the baseline UNets 0.825 for Reader #1 and 0.851 for Reader #2. SwinUNETR had an average dice score of 0.8583 for Reader#1 and 0.867 for Reader#2 in cross-validated mixed training. For the gland size-based dataset, SwinUNETR achieved an average dice score of 0.902 for Reader#1 subset and 0.894 for Reader#2, using the five-fold mixed training strategy (Reader#1, n=53; Reader#2, n=87) at larger gland size-based subsets, where UNETR performed poorly. Our findings demonstrate that global and shifted-window self-attention effectively reduces label noise and class imbalance sensitivity, resulting in improvements in the Dice score over CNNs by up to five points while maintaining computational efficiency. This contributes to the high robustness of SwinUNETR for clinical deployment.

Title: Demonstrating Superresolution in Radar Range Estimation Using a Denoising Autoencoder
Authors: Robert Czupryniak, Abhishek Chakraborty, Andrew N. Jordan, John C. Howell
Abstract: We apply machine learning methods to demonstrate range superresolution in remote sensing radar detection. Specifically, we implement a denoising autoencoder to estimate the distance between two equal intensity scatterers in the subwavelength regime. The machine learning models are trained on waveforms subject to a bandlimit constraint such that ranges much smaller than the inverse bandlimit are optimized in their precision. The autoencoder achieves effective dimensionality reduction, with the bottleneck layer exhibiting a strong and consistent correlation with the true scatterer separation. We confirm reproducibility across different training sessions and network initializations by analyzing the scaled encoder outputs and their robustness to noise. We investigate the behavior of the bottleneck layer for the following types of pulses: a traditional sinc pulse, a bandlimited triangle-type pulse, and a theoretically near-optimal pulse created from a spherical Bessel function basis. The Bessel signal performs best, followed by the triangle wave, with the sinc signal performing worst, highlighting the crucial role of signal design in the success of machine-learning-based range resolution.

Title: Foundation Artificial Intelligence Models for Health Recognition Using Face Photographs (FAHR-Face)
Authors: Fridolin Haugg, Grace Lee, John He, Leonard NÃ¼rnberg, Dennis Bontempi, Danielle S. Bitterman, Paul Catalano, Vasco Prudente, Dmitrii Glubokov, Andrew Warrington, Suraj Pai, Dirk De Ruysscher, Christian Guthier, Benjamin H. Kann, Vadim N. Gladyshev, Hugo JWL Aerts, Raymond H. Mak
Abstract: Background: Facial appearance offers a noninvasive window into health. We built FAHR-Face, a foundation model trained on >40 million facial images and fine-tuned it for two distinct tasks: biological age estimation (FAHR-FaceAge) and survival risk prediction (FAHR-FaceSurvival). Methods: FAHR-FaceAge underwent a two-stage, age-balanced fine-tuning on 749,935 public images; FAHR-FaceSurvival was fine-tuned on 34,389 photos of cancer patients. Model robustness (cosmetic surgery, makeup, pose, lighting) and independence (saliency mapping) was tested extensively. Both models were clinically tested in two independent cancer patient datasets with survival analyzed by multivariable Cox models and adjusted for clinical prognostic factors. Findings: For age estimation, FAHR-FaceAge had the lowest mean absolute error of 5.1 years on public datasets, outperforming benchmark models and maintaining accuracy across the full human lifespan. In cancer patients, FAHR-FaceAge outperformed a prior facial age estimation model in survival prognostication. FAHR-FaceSurvival demonstrated robust prediction of mortality, and the highest-risk quartile had more than triple the mortality of the lowest (adjusted hazard ratio 3.22; P<0.001). These findings were validated in the independent cohort and both models showed generalizability across age, sex, race and cancer subgroups. The two algorithms provided distinct, complementary prognostic information; saliency mapping revealed each model relied on distinct facial regions. The combination of FAHR-FaceAge and FAHR-FaceSurvival improved prognostic accuracy. Interpretation: A single foundation model can generate inexpensive, scalable facial biomarkers that capture both biological ageing and disease-related mortality risk. The foundation model enabled effective training using relatively small clinical datasets.

Title: Recursive Variational Autoencoders for 3D Blood Vessel Generative Modeling
Authors: Paula Feldman, Miguel Fainstein, Viviana Siless, Claudio Delrieux, Emmanuel Iarussi
Abstract: Anatomical trees play an important role in clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Yet, accurately representing these structures poses significant challenges owing to their intricate and varied topology and geometry. Most existing methods to synthesize vasculature are rule based, and despite providing some degree of control and variation in the structures produced, they fail to capture the diversity and complexity of actual anatomical data. We developed a Recursive variational Neural Network (RvNN) that fully exploits the hierarchical organization of the vessel and learns a low-dimensional manifold encoding branch connectivity along with geometry features describing the target surface. After training, the RvNN latent space can be sampled to generate new vessel geometries. By leveraging the power of generative neural networks, we generate 3D models of blood vessels that are both accurate and diverse, which is crucial for medical and surgical training, hemodynamic simulations, and many other purposes. These results closely resemble real data, achieving high similarity in vessel radii, length, and tortuosity across various datasets, including those with aneurysms. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to utilize this technique for synthesizing blood vessels.

Title: NeuroMoE: A Transformer-Based Mixture-of-Experts Framework for Multi-Modal Neurological Disorder Classification
Authors: Wajih Hassan Raza, Aamir Bader Shah, Yu Wen, Yidan Shen, Juan Diego Martinez Lemus, Mya Caryn Schiess, Timothy Michael Ellmore, Renjie Hu, Xin Fu
Abstract: The integration of multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and clinical data holds great promise for enhancing the diagnosis of neurological disorders (NDs) in real-world clinical settings. Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid in diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance. Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy, particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states. Our framework achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47\%, outperforming baseline methods by over 10\%, highlighting its potential to improve ND diagnosis by applying multi-modal learning to real-world clinical data.

Title: Thinking in Directivity: Speech Large Language Model for Multi-Talker Directional Speech Recognition
Authors: Jiamin Xie, Ju Lin, Yiteng Huang, Tyler Vuong, Zhaojiang Lin, Zhaojun Yang, Peng Su, Prashant Rawat, Sangeeta Srivastava, Ming Sun, Florian Metze
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that prompting large language models (LLM) with audio encodings enables effective speech recognition capabilities. However, the ability of Speech LLMs to comprehend and process multi-channel audio with spatial cues remains a relatively uninvestigated area of research. In this work, we present directional-SpeechLlama, a novel approach that leverages the microphone array of smart glasses to achieve directional speech recognition, source localization, and bystander cross-talk suppression. To enhance the model's ability to understand directivity, we propose two key techniques: serialized directional output training (S-DOT) and contrastive direction data augmentation (CDDA). Experimental results show that our proposed directional-SpeechLlama effectively captures the relationship between textual cues and spatial audio, yielding strong performance in both speech recognition and source localization tasks.

Title: Metasurfaces-Integrated Doubly-Dispersive MIMO: Channel Modeling and Optimization
Authors: Kuranage Roche Rayan Ranasinghe, Hyeon Seok Rou, IvÃ¡n Alexander Morales Sandoval, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, George C. Alexandropoulos
Abstract: The doubly-dispersive (DD) channel structure has played a pivotal role in wireless communications, particularly in high-mobility scenarios and integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), due to its ability to capture the key fading effects experienced by a transmitted signal as it propagates through a dynamic medium. However, extending the DD framework to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, especially in environments artificially enhanced by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM), remains a challenging open problem. In this chapter, a novel metasurfaces-parametrized DD (MPDD) channel model that integrates an arbitrary number of RISs, while also incorporating SIM at both the transmitter and receiver is introduced. Next, the application of this model to some key waveforms optimized for DD environments -- namely orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) -- is discussed. Finally, the programmability of the proposed model is highlighted through an illustrative application, demonstrating its potential for enhancing waveform performance in SIM-assisted wireless systems.

Title: Secure Time-Modulated Intelligent Reflecting Surface via Generative Flow Networks
Authors: Zhihao Tao, Athina P. Petropulu
Abstract: We propose a novel directional modulation (DM) design for OFDM transmitters aided by a time-modulated intelligent reflecting surface (TM-IRS). The TM-IRS is configured to preserve the integrity of transmitted signals toward multiple legitimate users while scrambling the signal in all other directions. Existing TM-IRS design methods typically target a single user direction and follow predefined rule-based procedures, making them unsuitable for multi-user scenarios. Here, we propose a generative AI-based approach to design good sets of TM-IRS parameters out of a set of all possible quantized ranges of parameters. The design objective is to maximize the sum rate across the authorized directions. We model the TM-IRS parameter selection as a deterministic Markov decision process (MDP), where each terminal state corresponds to a specific configuration of TM-IRS parameters. GFlowNets are employed to learn a stochastic policy that samples TM-IRS parameter sets with probability proportional to their associated sum rate reward. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances the security of the TM-IRS-aided OFDM systems with multi-users. Also, despite the vast size of the TM-IRS configuration space, the GFlowNet is able to converge after training on fewer than 0.000001% of all possible configurations, demonstrating remarkable efficiency compared to exhaustive combinatorial search. Implementation code is available at this https URL to facilitate reproducibility.

Title: Mixed Traffic: A Perspective from Long Duration Autonomy
Authors: Filippos Tzortzoglou, Logan E. Beaver
Abstract: The rapid adoption of autonomous vehicle has established mixed traffic environments, comprising both autonomous and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), as essential components of next-generation mobility systems. Along these lines, connectivity between autonomous vehicles and infrastructure (V2I) is also a significant factor that can effectively support higher-level decision-making. At the same time, the integration of V2I within mixed traffic environments remains a timely and challenging problem. In this paper, we present a long-duration autonomy controller for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) operating in such environments, with a focus on intersections where right turns on red are permitted. We begin by deriving the optimal control policy for CAVs under free-flow traffic. Next, we analyze crossing time constraints imposed by smart traffic lights and map these constraints to controller bounds using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), with the aim to drive a CAV to cross the intersection on time. We also introduce criteria for identifying, in real-time, feasible crossing intervals for each CAV. To ensure safety for the CAVs, we present model-agnostic safety guarantees, and demonstrate their compatibility with both CAVs and HDVs. Ultimately, the final control actions are enforced through a combination of CBF constraints, constraining CAVs to traverse the intersection within the designated time intervals while respecting other vehicles. Finally, we guarantee that our control policy yields always a feasible solution and validate the proposed approach through extensive simulations in MATLAB.

Title: Algorithmic Approaches to Enhance Safety in Autonomous Vehicles: Minimizing Lane Changes and Merging
Authors: Seyed Moein Abtahi, Akramul Azim
Abstract: The rapid advancements in autonomous vehicle (AV) technology promise enhanced safety and operational efficiency. However, frequent lane changes and merging maneuvers continue to pose significant safety risks and disrupt traffic flow. This paper introduces the Minimizing Lane Change Algorithm (MLCA), a state-machine-based approach designed to reduce unnecessary lane changes, thereby enhancing both traffic safety and efficiency. The MLCA algorithm prioritizes maintaining lane stability unless safety-critical conditions necessitate a lane change. The algorithm's effectiveness was evaluated through simulations conducted on the SUMO platform, comparing its performance against established models, including LC2017 and MOBIL. Results demonstrate substantial reductions in lane changes and collisions, leading to smoother traffic flow and improved safety metrics. Additionally, the study highlights the MLCA's adaptability to various traffic densities and roadway configurations, showcasing its potential for wide-scale deployment in real-world AV systems. Future work aims to validate these findings in more complex scenarios using the CARLA simulator, which will enable the testing of the algorithm under more dynamic and high-fidelity conditions, such as urban traffic environments with diverse road users. Moreover, the integration of cybersecurity measures for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication will be explored to ensure robust and secure data exchange, further enhancing the reliability and safety of AV operations. This research contributes to the broader goal of developing intelligent traffic systems that optimize both individual vehicle performance and overall traffic network efficiency.

Title: Make Your AUV Adaptive: An Environment-Aware Reinforcement Learning Framework For Underwater Tasks
Authors: Yimian Ding, Jingzehua Xu, Guanwen Xie, Shuai Zhang, Yi Li
Abstract: This study presents a novel environment-aware reinforcement learning (RL) framework designed to augment the operational capabilities of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in underwater environments. Departing from traditional RL architectures, the proposed framework integrates an environment-aware network module that dynamically captures flow field data, effectively embedding this critical environmental information into the state space. This integration facilitates real-time environmental adaptation, significantly enhancing the AUV's situational awareness and decision-making capabilities. Furthermore, the framework incorporates AUV structure characteristics into the optimization process, employing a large language model (LLM)-based iterative refinement mechanism that leverages both environmental conditions and training outcomes to optimize task performance. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the framework's superior performance, robustness and adaptability.

Title: Skew-Induced Insertion Loss Deviation (SILD) and FOM_SILD: Metrics for Quantifying P/N Skew Effects in High-Speed Channels
Authors: David Nozadze, Zurab Kiguradze, Amendra Koul, Mike Sapozhnikov
Abstract: The rise of AI workloads and growing data center demands have driven the need for ultra-high-speed interconnects exceeding 200 Gb/s. As unit intervals (UI) shrink, even a few picoseconds of P/N skew can degrade serializer-deserializer (SerDes) performance. Traditional methods for quantifying skew fall short in capturing its impact. We introduce two new metrics: 1) Skew-Induced Insertion Loss Deviation (SILD) and 2) its complementary Figure of Merit (FOM_SILD), analytically developed to assess P/N skew effects. Measured S-parameters confirm FOM_SILD reciprocity, while simulations of 224G PAM4 SerDes show strong correlation with bit error rate (BER) trends. This approach offers a robust framework for analyzing skew in next-generation ultra-high-speed interconnects.

Title: Local Differential Privacy for Distributed Stochastic Aggregative Optimization with Guaranteed Optimality
Authors: Ziqin Chen, Yongqiang Wang
Abstract: Distributed aggregative optimization underpins many cooperative optimization and multi-agent control systems, where each agent's objective function depends both on its local optimization variable and an aggregate of all agents' optimization variables. Existing distributed aggregative optimization approaches typically require access to accurate gradients of the objective functions, which, however, are often hard to obtain in real-world applications. For example, in machine learning, gradients are commonly contaminated by two main sources of noise: the randomness inherent in sampled data, and the additional variability introduced by mini-batch computations. In addition to the issue of relying on accurate gradients, existing distributed aggregative optimization approaches require agents to share explicit information, which could breach the privacy of participating agents. We propose an algorithm that can solve both problems with existing distributed aggregative optimization approaches: not only can the proposed algorithm guarantee mean-square convergence to an exact optimal solution when the gradients are subject to noise, it also simultaneously ensures rigorous differential privacy, with the cumulative privacy budget guaranteed to be finite even when the number of iterations tends to infinity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm able to guarantee both accurate convergence and rigorous differential privacy in distributed aggregative optimization. Besides characterizing the convergence rates under nonconvex/convex/strongly convex conditions, we also rigorously quantify the cost of differential privacy in terms of convergence rates. Experimental results on personalized machine learning using benchmark datasets confirm the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

Title: A Force Feedback Exoskeleton for Teleoperation Using Magnetorheological Clutches
Authors: Zhongyuan Kong, Lei Li, Erwin Ang Tien Yew, Zirui Chen, Wenbo Li, Shiwu Zhang, Jian Yang, Shuaishuai Sun
Abstract: This paper proposes an upper-limb exoskeleton teleoperation system based on magnetorheological (MR) clutches, aiming to improve operational accuracy and enhance the immersive experience during lunar sampling tasks. Conventional exoskeleton teleoperation systems commonly employ active force feedback solutions, such as servo motors, which typically suffer from high system complexity and increased energy consumption. Furthermore, force feedback devices utilizing motors and gear reducers generally compromise backdrivability and pose safety risks to operators due to active force output. To address these limitations, we propose a semi-active force feedback strategy based on MR clutches. Dynamic magnetic field control enables precise adjustment of joint stiffness and damping, thereby providing smooth and high-resolution force feedback. The designed MR clutch exhibits outstanding performance across key metrics, achieving a torque-to-mass ratio (TMR) of 93.6 Nm/kg, a torque-to-volume ratio (TVR) of 4.05 x 10^5 Nm/m^3, and a torque-to-power ratio (TPR) of 4.15 Nm/W. Notably, the TMR represents an improvement of approximately 246% over a representative design in prior work. Experimental results validate the system's capability to deliver high-fidelity force feedback. Overall, the proposed system presents a promising solution for deep-space teleoperation with strong potential for real-world deployment in future missions.

Title: Fiber Signal Denoising Algorithm using Hybrid Deep Learning Networks
Authors: Linlin Wang, Wei Wang, Dezhao Wang, Shanwen Wang
Abstract: With the applicability of optical fiber-based distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) systems, effective signal processing and analysis approaches are needed to promote its popularization in the field of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). This paper presents a signal denoising algorithm using a hybrid deep-learning network (HDLNet). Without annotated data and time-consuming labeling, this self-supervised network runs in parallel, combining an autoencoder for denoising (DAE) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) for sequential processing. Additionally, a line-by-line matching algorithm for vehicle detection and tracking is introduced, thus realizing the complete processing of fiber signal denoising and feature extraction. Experiments were carried out on a self-established real highway tunnel dataset, showing that our proposed hybrid network yields more satisfactory denoising performance than Spatial-domain DAE.

Title: Out-of-Band Modality Synergy Based Multi-User Beam Prediction and Proactive BS Selection with Zero Pilot Overhead
Authors: Kehui Li, Binggui Zhou, Jiajia Guo, Feifei Gao, Guanghua Yang, Shaodan Ma
Abstract: Multi-user millimeter-wave communication relies on narrow beams and dense cell deployments to ensure reliable connectivity. However, tracking optimal beams for multiple mobile users across multiple base stations (BSs) results in significant signaling overhead. Recent works have explored the capability of out-of-band (OOB) modalities in obtaining spatial characteristics of wireless channels and reducing pilot overhead in single-BS single-user/multi-user systems. However, applying OOB modalities for multi-BS selection towards dense cell deployments leads to high coordination overhead, i.e, excessive computing overhead and high latency in data exchange. How to leverage OOB modalities to eliminate pilot overhead and achieve efficient multi-BS coordination in multi-BS systems remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel OOB modality synergy (OMS) based mobility management scheme to realize multi-user beam prediction and proactive BS selection by synergizing two OOB modalities, i.e., vision and location. Specifically, mobile users are initially identified via spatial alignment of visual sensing and location feedback, and then tracked according to the temporal correlation in image sequence. Subsequently, a binary encoding map based gain and beam prediction network (BEM-GBPN) is designed to predict beamforming gains and optimal beams for mobile users at each BS, such that a central unit can control the BSs to perform user handoff and beam switching. Simulation results indicate that the proposed OMS-based mobility management scheme enhances beam prediction and BS selection accuracy and enables users to achieve 91% transmission rates of the optimal with zero pilot overhead and significantly improve multi-BS coordination efficiency compared to existing methods.

Title: Probabilistic Trajectory GOSPA: A Metric for Uncertainty-Aware Multi-Object Tracking Performance Evaluation
Authors: Yuxuan Xia, Ãngel F. GarcÃ­a-FernÃ¡ndez, Johan Karlsson, Yu Ge, Lennart Svensson, Ting Yuan
Abstract: This paper presents a generalization of the trajectory general optimal sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) metric for evaluating multi-object tracking algorithms that provide trajectory estimates with track-level uncertainties. This metric builds on the recently introduced probabilistic GOSPA metric to account for both the existence and state estimation uncertainties of individual object states. Similar to trajectory GOSPA (TGOSPA), it can be formulated as a multidimensional assignment problem, and its linear programming relaxation--also a valid metric--is computable in polynomial time. Additionally, this metric retains the interpretability of TGOSPA, and we show that its decomposition yields intuitive costs terms associated to expected localization error and existence probability mismatch error for properly detected objects, expected missed and false detection error, and track switch error. The effectiveness of the proposed metric is demonstrated through a simulation study.

Title: Classification of Multi-Parametric Body MRI Series Using Deep Learning
Authors: Boah Kim, Tejas Sudharshan Mathai, Kimberly Helm, Peter A. Pinto, Ronald M. Summers
Abstract: Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) exams have various series types acquired with different imaging protocols. The DICOM headers of these series often have incorrect information due to the sheer diversity of protocols and occasional technologist errors. To address this, we present a deep learning-based classification model to classify 8 different body mpMRI series types so that radiologists read the exams efficiently. Using mpMRI data from various institutions, multiple deep learning-based classifiers of ResNet, EfficientNet, and DenseNet are trained to classify 8 different MRI series, and their performance is compared. Then, the best-performing classifier is identified, and its classification capability under the setting of different training data quantities is studied. Also, the model is evaluated on the out-of-training-distribution datasets. Moreover, the model is trained using mpMRI exams obtained from different scanners in two training strategies, and its performance is tested. Experimental results show that the DenseNet-121 model achieves the highest F1-score and accuracy of 0.966 and 0.972 over the other classification models with p-value$<$0.05. The model shows greater than 0.95 accuracy when trained with over 729 studies of the training data, whose performance improves as the training data quantities grew larger. On the external data with the DLDS and CPTAC-UCEC datasets, the model yields 0.872 and 0.810 accuracy for each. These results indicate that in both the internal and external datasets, the DenseNet-121 model attains high accuracy for the task of classifying 8 body MRI series types.

Title: Islanding Strategy for Smart Grids Oriented to Resilience Enhancement and Its Power Supply Range Optimization
Authors: Yanhong Luo, Wenchao Meng, Xi Zhu, Andreas Elombo, Hu Rong, Bing Xie, Tianwen Zhang
Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of distributed generators, islanded operation based on distributed generation is considered a vital means to enhance the reliability and resilience of smart grids. This paper investigates the main factors in islanding partition of smart grids and establishes a mathematical model for islanding division. A method to determine the maximum power supply range of distributed energy resources (DERs) based on the reachability matrix and power circle algorithm is proposed to improve computational efficiency. A dynamic programming method based on breadth-first search (BFS) is used to solve the islanding partition scheme, and a region correction method is applied to modify the maximum power supply area by considering controllable loads and prioritizing critical load restoration, thereby enhancing system resilience. Finally, simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in improving smart grid resilience.

Title: Microgrid Operation Control with Adaptable Droop Gains
Authors: E. D. Gomez Anccas, C. A. Hans, D. Schulz
Abstract: Modern low-carbon power systems come with many challenges, such as increased inverter penetration and increased uncertainty from renewable sources and loads. In this context, the microgrid concept is a promising approach, which is based on a segmentation of the grid into independent smaller cells that can run either in grid-connected or standalone this http URL microgrids, droop control is widely used for primary control. It enables proportional power sharing, depending on the droop gains. Operation control schemes considering droop control often assume fixed droop gains. However, using adaptive droop gains for grid-forming units allow to shape power sharing in presence of fluctuations, enhancing flexibility while maintaining a safe microgrid operation, particularly under uncertainty. This work introduces a bilinear formulation for microgrid operation control that finds optimal power setpoints and droop gains on a timescale of minutes by solving a finite horizon optimization problem. In detail, a robust minmax model predictive control scheme is designed for a standalone microgrid, comprising a fuel cell, a photovoltaic system and an energy storage. Closed-loop simulations are performed with and without variable droop gains. The results show an increase in renewable utilization of up to 7.5 % while reducing the power output of the fuel cell by 6 %, when allowing variable droop gains.

Title: ABC: Adaptive BayesNet Structure Learning for Computational Scalable Multi-task Image Compression
Authors: Yufeng Zhang, Wenrui Dai, Hang Yu, Shizhan Liu, Junhui Hou, Jianguo Li, Weiyao Lin
Abstract: Neural Image Compression (NIC) has revolutionized image compression with its superior rate-distortion performance and multi-task capabilities, supporting both human visual perception and machine vision tasks. However, its widespread adoption is hindered by substantial computational demands. While existing approaches attempt to address this challenge through module-specific optimizations or pre-defined complexity levels, they lack comprehensive control over computational complexity. We present ABC (Adaptive BayesNet structure learning for computational scalable multi-task image Compression), a novel, comprehensive framework that achieves computational scalability across all NIC components through Bayesian network (BayesNet) structure learning. ABC introduces three key innovations: (i) a heterogeneous bipartite BayesNet (inter-node structure) for managing neural backbone computations; (ii) a homogeneous multipartite BayesNet (intra-node structure) for optimizing autoregressive unit processing; and (iii) an adaptive control module that dynamically adjusts the BayesNet structure based on device capabilities, input data complexity, and downstream task requirements. Experiments demonstrate that ABC enables full computational scalability with better complexity adaptivity and broader complexity control span, while maintaining competitive compression performance. Furthermore, the framework's versatility allows integration with various NIC architectures that employ BayesNet representations, making it a robust solution for ensuring computational scalability in NIC applications. Code is available in this https URL.

Title: Enhancing eLoran Timing Accuracy via Machine Learning with Meteorological and Terrain Data
Authors: Taewon Kang, Seunghyeon Park, Pyo-Woong Son, Jiwon Seo
Abstract: The vulnerabilities of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) to signal interference have increased the demand for complementary positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) systems. To address this, South Korea has decided to deploy an enhanced long-range navigation (eLoran) system as a complementary PNT solution. Similar to GNSS, eLoran provides highly accurate timing information, which is essential for applications such as telecommunications, financial systems, and power distribution. However, the primary sources of error for GNSS and eLoran differ. For eLoran, the main source of error is signal propagation delay over land, known as the additional secondary factor (ASF). This delay, influenced by ground conductivity and weather conditions along the signal path, is challenging to predict and mitigate. In this paper, we measure the time difference (TD) between GPS and eLoran using a time interval counter and analyze the correlations between eLoran/GPS TD and eleven meteorological factors. Accurate estimation of eLoran/GPS TD could enable eLoran to achieve timing accuracy comparable to that of GPS. We propose two estimation models for eLoran/GPS TD and compare their performance with existing TD estimation methods. The proposed WLR-AGRNN model captures the linear relationships between meteorological factors and eLoran/GPS TD using weighted linear regression (WLR) and models nonlinear relationships between outputs from expert networks through an anisotropic general regression neural network (AGRNN). The model incorporates terrain elevation to appropriately weight meteorological data, as elevation influences signal propagation delay. Experimental results based on four months of data demonstrate that the WLR-AGRNN model outperforms other models, highlighting its effectiveness in improving eLoran/GPS TD estimation accuracy.

Title: Privacy-Preserving Chest X-ray Classification in Latent Space with Homomorphically Encrypted Neural Inference
Authors: Jonghun Kim, Gyeongdeok Jo, Shinyoung Ra, Hyunjin Park
Abstract: Medical imaging data contain sensitive patient information requiring strong privacy protection. Many analytical setups require data to be sent to a server for inference purposes. Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a solution by allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data without revealing the original information. However, HE inference is computationally expensive, particularly for large images (e.g., chest X-rays). In this study, we propose an HE inference framework for medical images that uses VQGAN to compress images into latent representations, thereby significantly reducing the computational burden while preserving image quality. We approximate the activation functions with lower-degree polynomials to balance the accuracy and efficiency in compliance with HE requirements. We observed that a downsampling factor of eight for compression achieved an optimal balance between performance and computational cost. We further adapted the squeeze and excitation module, which is known to improve traditional CNNs, to enhance the HE framework. Our method was tested on two chest X-ray datasets for multi-label classification tasks using vanilla CNN backbones. Although HE inference remains relatively slow and introduces minor performance differences compared with unencrypted inference, our approach shows strong potential for practical use in medical images

Title: Reinforcement Learning-Based Policy Optimisation For Heterogeneous Radio Access
Authors: Anup Mishra, Äedomir StefanoviÄ, Xiuqiang Xu, Petar Popovski, Israel Leyva-Mayorga
Abstract: Flexible and efficient wireless resource sharing across heterogeneous services is a key objective for future wireless networks. In this context, we investigate the performance of a system where latency-constrained internet-of-things (IoT) devices coexist with a broadband user. The base station adopts a grant-free access framework to manage resource allocation, either through orthogonal radio access network (RAN) slicing or by allowing shared access between services. For the IoT users, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach based on double Q-Learning (QL) to optimise their repetition-based transmission strategy, allowing them to adapt to varying levels of interference and meet a predefined latency target. We evaluate the system's performance in terms of the cumulative distribution function of IoT users' latency, as well as the broadband user's throughput and energy efficiency (EE). Our results show that the proposed RL-based access policies significantly enhance the latency performance of IoT users in both RAN Slicing and RAN Sharing scenarios, while preserving desirable broadband throughput and EE. Furthermore, the proposed policies enable RAN Sharing to be energy-efficient at low IoT traffic levels, and RAN Slicing to be favourable under high IoT traffic.

Title: Urban RIS-Assisted HAP Networks: Performance Analysis Using Stochastic Geometry
Authors: Islam M. Tanash, Ayush Kumar Dwivedi, Taneli Riihonen
Abstract: This paper studies a high-altitude platform (HAP) network supported by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). The practical irregular placement of HAPs and RISs is modeled using homogeneous Poisson point processes, while buildings that cause blockages in urban areas are modeled as a Boolean scheme of rectangles. We introduce a novel approach to characterize the statistical channel based on generalized Beta prime distribution. Analytical expressions for coverage probability and ergodic capacity in an interference-limited system are derived and validated through Monte Carlo simulations. The findings show notable performance improvements and reveal the impact of various system parameters, including blockages effect which contribute in mitigating interference from the other visible HAPs. This proposed system could enhance connectivity and enable effective data offloading in urban environments.

Title: Brain Stroke Classification Using Wavelet Transform and MLP Neural Networks on DWI MRI Images
Authors: Mana Mohammadi, Amirhesam Jafari Rad, Ashkan Behrouzi
Abstract: This paper presents a lightweight framework for classifying brain stroke types from Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) MRI scans, employing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network with Wavelet Transform for feature extraction. Accurate and timely stroke detection is critical for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes in neuroimaging. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used for medical image analysis, their computational complexity often hinders deployment in resource-constrained clinical settings. In contrast, our approach combines Wavelet Transform with a compact MLP to achieve efficient and accurate stroke classification. Using the "Brain Stroke MRI Images" dataset, our method yields classification accuracies of 82.0% with the "db4" wavelet (level 3 decomposition) and 86.00% with the "Haar" wavelet (level 2 decomposition). This analysis highlights a balance between diagnostic accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical solution for automated stroke diagnosis. Future research will focus on enhancing model robustness and integrating additional MRI modalities for comprehensive stroke assessment.

Title: FedWSIDD: Federated Whole Slide Image Classification via Dataset Distillation
Authors: Haolong Jin, Shenglin Liu, Cong Cong, Qingmin Feng, Yongzhi Liu, Lina Huang, Yingzi Hu
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for collaborative medical image analysis, enabling multiple institutions to build robust predictive models while preserving sensitive patient data. In the context of Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, FL faces significant challenges, including heterogeneous computational resources across participating medical institutes and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose FedWSIDD, a novel FL paradigm that leverages dataset distillation (DD) to learn and transmit synthetic slides. On the server side, FedWSIDD aggregates synthetic slides from participating centres and distributes them across all centres. On the client side, we introduce a novel DD algorithm tailored to histopathology datasets which incorporates stain normalisation into the distillation process to generate a compact set of highly informative synthetic slides. These synthetic slides, rather than model parameters, are transmitted to the server. After communication, the received synthetic slides are combined with original slides for local tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple WSI classification tasks, including CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17, demonstrate that FedWSIDD offers flexibility for heterogeneous local models, enhances local WSI classification performance, and preserves patient privacy. This makes it a highly effective solution for complex WSI classification tasks. The code is available at FedWSIDD.

Title: Disruption of parkinsonian brain oscillations
Authors: CÃ©dric Join, Jakub OrÅowski, Antoine Chaillet, Madeleine Lowery, Hugues Mounier, Michel Fliess
Abstract: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an advanced surgical treatment for the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), involving electrical stimulation of neurons within the basal ganglia region of the brain. DBS is traditionally delivered in an open-loop manner using fixed stimulation parameters, which may lead to suboptimal results. In an effort to overcome these limitations, closed loop DBS, using pathological subthalamic beta (13--30 Hz) activity as a feedback signal, offers the potential to adapt DBS automatically in response to changes in patient symptoms and side effects. However, clinically implemented closed-loop techniques have been limited to date to simple control algorithms, due to the inherent uncertainties in the dynamics involved. Model-free control, which has already seen successful applications in the field of bioengineering, offers a way to avoid this limitation and provides an alternative method to apply modern control approach to selective suppression of pathological oscillations.

Title: A Real-time Endoscopic Image Denoising System
Authors: Yu Xing, Shishi Huang, Meng Lv, Guo Chen, Huailiang Wang, Lingzhi Sui
Abstract: Endoscopes featuring a miniaturized design have significantly enhanced operational flexibility, portability, and diagnostic capability while substantially reducing the invasiveness of medical procedures. Recently, single-use endoscopes equipped with an ultra-compact analogue image sensor measuring less than 1mm x 1mm bring revolutionary advancements to medical diagnosis. They reduce the structural redundancy and large capital expenditures associated with reusable devices, eliminate the risk of patient infections caused by inadequate disinfection, and alleviate patient suffering. However, the limited photosensitive area results in reduced photon capture per pixel, requiring higher photon sensitivity settings to maintain adequate brightness. In high-contrast medical imaging scenarios, the small-sized sensor exhibits a constrained dynamic range, making it difficult to simultaneously capture details in both highlights and shadows, and additional localized digital gain is required to compensate. Moreover, the simplified circuit design and analog signal transmission introduce additional noise sources. These factors collectively contribute to significant noise issues in processed endoscopic images. In this work, we developed a comprehensive noise model for analog image sensors in medical endoscopes, addressing three primary noise types: fixed-pattern noise, periodic banding noise, and mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise. Building on this analysis, we propose a hybrid denoising system that synergistically combines traditional image processing algorithms with advanced learning-based techniques for captured raw frames from sensors. Experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces image noise without fine detail loss or color distortion, while achieving real-time performance on FPGA platforms and an average PSNR improvement from 21.16 to 33.05 on our test dataset.

Title: Multi-dimensional evaluation on a rural integrated energy system including solar, wind, biomass and geothermal energy
Authors: Ruonan Lia, Chang Wena, Mingyu Yan, Congcong Wu, Ahmed Lotfy Elrefai, Xiaotong Zhang, Sahban Wael Saeed Alnaser
Abstract: This study focuses on the novel municipal-scale rural integrated energy system (RIES), which encompasses energy supply and application. By constructing a seven-dimensional evaluation system including energy efficiency, energy supply, low-carbon sustainability, environmental impact, energy economy, social benefits, and integrated energy system development, this research combines the improved analytic hierarchy process (IAHP) and entropy weight method (EWM) by sum of squares of deviations to balance expert experience and data objectivity. Furthermore, the cloud model is introduced to handle the fuzziness and randomness in the evaluation. This method can quantify the differences in system performance before and after the planning implementation. The results indicate that after planning, the comprehensive score has increased from 83.12 to 87.55, the entropy value has decreased from 6.931 to 5.336, indicating enhanced system stability. The hyper-entropy has dropped from 3.08 to 2.278, reflecting a reduction in uncertainty. The research findings provide a scientific basis for the planning optimization, policy-making, and sustainable development of rural integrated energy systems, possessing both theoretical innovation and practical guiding value.

Title: Model Predictive Path-Following Control for a Quadrotor
Authors: David Leprich, Mario Rosenfelder, Mario Hermle, Jingshan Chen, Peter Eberhard
Abstract: Automating drone-assisted processes is a complex task. Many solutions rely on trajectory generation and tracking, whereas in contrast, path-following control is a particularly promising approach, offering an intuitive and natural approach to automate tasks for drones and other vehicles. While different solutions to the path-following problem have been proposed, most of them lack the capability to explicitly handle state and input constraints, are formulated in a conservative two-stage approach, or are only applicable to linear systems. To address these challenges, the paper is built upon a Model Predictive Control-based path-following framework and extends its application to the Crazyflie quadrotor, which is investigated in hardware experiments. A cascaded control structure including an underlying attitude controller is included in the Model Predictive Path-Following Control formulation to meet the challenging real-time demands of quadrotor control. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through real-world experiments, representing, to the best of the authors' knowledge, a novel application of this MPC-based path-following approach to the quadrotor. Additionally, as an extension to the original method, to allow for deviations of the path in cases where the precise following of the path might be overly restrictive, a corridor path-following approach is presented.

Title: Factorized RVQ-GAN For Disentangled Speech Tokenization
Authors: Sameer Khurana, Dominik Klement, Antoine Laurent, Dominik Bobos, Juraj Novosad, Peter Gazdik, Ellen Zhang, Zili Huang, Amir Hussein, Ricard Marxer, Yoshiki Masuyama, Ryo Aihara, Chiori Hori, Francois G. Germain, Gordon Wichern, Jonathan Le Roux
Abstract: We propose Hierarchical Audio Codec (HAC), a unified neural speech codec that factorizes its bottleneck into three linguistic levels-acoustic, phonetic, and lexical-within a single model. HAC leverages two knowledge distillation objectives: one from a pre-trained speech encoder (HuBERT) for phoneme-level structure, and another from a text-based encoder (LaBSE) for lexical cues. Experiments on English and multilingual data show that HAC's factorized bottleneck yields disentangled token sets: one aligns with phonemes, while another captures word-level semantics. Quantitative evaluations confirm that HAC tokens preserve naturalness and provide interpretable linguistic information, outperforming single-level baselines in both disentanglement and reconstruction quality. These findings underscore HAC's potential as a unified discrete speech representation, bridging acoustic detail and lexical meaning for downstream speech generation and understanding tasks.

Title: Effect of Signal Quantization on Performance Measures of a 1st Order One Dimensional Differential Microphone Array
Authors: Shweta Pal, Arun Kumar, Monika Agrawal
Abstract: In practical systems, recorded analog signals must be digitized for processing, introducing quantization as a critical aspect of data acquisition. While prior studies have examined quantization effects in various signal processing contexts, its impact on differential microphone arrays (DMAs), particularly in one-dimensional (1D) first-order configurations, remains unexplored. This paper investigates the influence of signal quantization on performance of first-order 1D DMAs across various beampatterns. An analytical expression for quantized beamformed output for a first-order 1D DMA has been formulated. The effect of signal quantization has been studied on array performance measures such as the Beampattern, Directivity Factor (DF), Front-to-Back Ratio (FBR), and null depth (ND). Simulation results reveal that beampattern shape remains structurally invariant across quantization bit depths, with quantization primarily affecting ND. DF and FBR remain constant with the varying number of quantization bits. Additionally, ND is shown to be frequency-independent; however, it increases with increasing quantization bit depths, enhancing interference suppression. The study also examines the effect of steering nulls across the azimuthal range, showing that ND degrades as the null moves closer to the source look direction, indicating reduced interference suppression.

Title: DATA-DRIVEN PRONTO: a Model-free Solution for Numerical Optimal Control
Authors: Marco Borghesi, Lorenzo Sforni, Giuseppe Notarstefano
Abstract: This article addresses the problem of data-driven numerical optimal control for unknown nonlinear systems. In our scenario, we suppose to have the possibility of performing multiple experiments (or simulations) on the system. Experiments are performed by relying on a data-driven tracking controller able to steer the system towards a desired reference. Our proposed DATA-DRIVEN PRONTO algorithm iteratively refines a tentative solution of the optimal control problem by computing an approximate descent direction via a local trajectory perturbation. At each iteration, multiple trajectories are gathered by perturbing the current trajectory with a suitable dither signal, and then used to obtain a data-driven, time-varying linearization. The exploration is guided by the tracking controller, so that perturbed trajectories are obtained in closed loop. We show local convergence of DATA-DRIVEN PRONTO to a ball about an isolated optimal solution, whose radius depends on the amplitude of the dither signal. We corroborate the theoretical results by applying it to an underactuated robot.

Title: Analyzing URA Geometry for Enhanced Spatial Multiplexing and Extended Near-Field Coverage
Authors: Ahmed Hussain, Asmaa Abdallah, Abdulkadir Celik, Ahmed M. Eltawil
Abstract: With the deployment of large antenna arrays at high frequency bands, future wireless communication systems are likely to operate in the radiative near-field. Unlike far-field beam steering, near-field beams can be focused within a spatial region of finite depth, enabling spatial multiplexing in both the angular and range dimensions. This paper derives the beamdepth for a generalized uniform rectangular array (URA) and investigates how array geometry influences the near-field beamdepth and the limits where near-field beamfocusing is achievable. To characterize the near-field boundary in terms of beamfocusing and spatial multiplexing gains, we define the effective beamfocusing Rayleigh distance (EBRD) for a generalized URA. Our analysis reveals that while a square URA achieves the narrowest beamdepth, the EBRD is maximized for a wide or tall URA. However, despite its narrow beamdepth, a square URA may experience a reduction in multiuser sum rate due to its severely constrained EBRD. Simulation results confirm that a wide or tall URA achieves a sum rate of 3.5 X more than that of a square URA, benefiting from the extended EBRD and improved spatial multiplexing capabilities.

Title: Advanced cervical cancer classification: enhancing pap smear images with hybrid PMD Filter-CLAHE
Authors: Ach Khozaimi, Isnani Darti, Syaiful Anam, Wuryansari Muharini Kusumawinahyu
Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a significant health problem, especially in developing countries. Early detection is critical for effective treatment. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown promise in automated cervical cancer screening, but their performance depends on Pap smear image quality. This study investigates the impact of various image preprocessing techniques on CNN performance for cervical cancer classification using the SIPaKMeD dataset. Three preprocessing techniques were evaluated: perona-malik diffusion (PMD) filter for noise reduction, contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) for image contrast enhancement, and the proposed hybrid PMD filter-CLAHE approach. The enhanced image datasets were evaluated on pretrained models, such as ResNet-34, ResNet-50, SqueezeNet-1.0, MobileNet-V2, EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B1, DenseNet-121, and DenseNet-201. The results show that hybrid preprocessing PMD filter-CLAHE can improve the Pap smear image quality and CNN architecture performance compared to the original images. The maximum metric improvements are 13.62% for accuracy, 10.04% for precision, 13.08% for recall, and 14.34% for F1-score. The proposed hybrid PMD filter-CLAHE technique offers a new perspective in improving cervical cancer classification performance using CNN architectures.

Title: Construction of an Organ Shape Atlas Using a Hierarchical Mesh Variational Autoencoder
Authors: Zijie Wang, Ryuichi Umehara, Mitsuhiro Nakamura, Megumi Nakao
Abstract: An organ shape atlas, which represents the shape and position of the organs and skeleton of a living body using a small number of parameters, is expected to have a wide range of clinical applications, including intraoperative guidance and radiotherapy. Because the shape and position of soft organs vary greatly among patients, it is difficult for linear models to reconstruct shapes that have large local variations. Because it is difficult for conventional nonlinear models to control and interpret the organ shapes obtained, deep learning has been attracting attention in three-dimensional shape representation. In this study, we propose an organ shape atlas based on a mesh variational autoencoder (MeshVAE) with hierarchical latent variables. To represent the complex shapes of biological organs and nonlinear shape differences between individuals, the proposed method maintains the performance of organ shape reconstruction by hierarchizing latent variables and enables shape representation using lower-dimensional latent variables. Additionally, templates that define vertex correspondence between different resolutions enable hierarchical representation in mesh data and control the global and local features of the organ shape. We trained the model using liver and stomach organ meshes obtained from 124 cases and confirmed that the model reconstructed the position and shape with an average distance between vertices of 1.5 mm and mean distance of 0.7 mm for the liver shape, and an average distance between vertices of 1.4 mm and mean distance of 0.8 mm for the stomach shape on test data from 19 of cases. The proposed method continuously represented interpolated shapes, and by changing latent variables at different hierarchical levels, the proposed method hierarchically separated shape features compared with PCA.

Title: Automated MRI Tumor Segmentation using hybrid U-Net with Transformer and Efficient Attention
Authors: Syed Haider Ali, Asrar Ahmad, Muhammad Ali, Asifullah Khan, Muhammad Shahban, Nadeem Shaukat
Abstract: Cancer is an abnormal growth with potential to invade locally and metastasize to distant organs. Accurate auto-segmentation of the tumor and surrounding normal tissues is required for radiotherapy treatment plan optimization. Recent AI-based segmentation models are generally trained on large public datasets, which lack the heterogeneity of local patient populations. While these studies advance AI-based medical image segmentation, research on local datasets is necessary to develop and integrate AI tumor segmentation models directly into hospital software for efficient and accurate oncology treatment planning and execution. This study enhances tumor segmentation using computationally efficient hybrid UNet-Transformer models on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets acquired from a local hospital under strict privacy protection. We developed a robust data pipeline for seamless DICOM extraction and preprocessing, followed by extensive image augmentation to ensure model generalization across diverse clinical settings, resulting in a total dataset of 6080 images for training. Our novel architecture integrates UNet-based convolutional neural networks with a transformer bottleneck and complementary attention modules, including efficient attention, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and ResNeXt blocks. To accelerate convergence and reduce computational demands, we used a maximum batch size of 8 and initialized the encoder with pretrained ImageNet weights, training the model on dual NVIDIA T4 GPUs via checkpointing to overcome Kaggle's runtime limits. Quantitative evaluation on the local MRI dataset yielded a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.764 and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.736, demonstrating competitive performance despite limited data and underscoring the importance of site-specific model development for clinical deployment.

Title: A Data-Integrated Framework for Learning Fractional-Order Nonlinear Dynamical Systems
Authors: Bahram Yaghooti, Chengyu Li, Bruno Sinopoli
Abstract: This paper presents a data-integrated framework for learning the dynamics of fractional-order nonlinear systems in both discrete-time and continuous-time settings. The proposed framework consists of two main steps. In the first step, input-output experiments are designed to generate the necessary datasets for learning the system dynamics, including the fractional order, the drift vector field, and the control vector field. In the second step, these datasets, along with the memory-dependent property of fractional-order systems, are used to estimate the system's fractional order. The drift and control vector fields are then reconstructed using orthonormal basis functions. To validate the proposed approach, the algorithm is applied to four benchmark fractional-order systems. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework in learning the system dynamics accurately. Finally, the same datasets are used to learn equivalent integer-order models. The numerical comparisons demonstrate that fractional-order models better capture long-range dependencies, highlighting the limitations of integer-order representations.

Title: Near-Field SWIPT with gMIMO in the Upper Mid-Band: Opportunities, Challenges, and the Way Forward
Authors: Ãzlem Tugfe Demir, Mustafa Ozger, Ferdi Kara, Woong-Hee Lee, Emil BjÃ¶rnson
Abstract: This paper explores the integration of simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) with gigantic multiple-input multiple-output (gMIMO) technology operating in the upper mid-band frequency range (7-24 GHz). The near-field propagation achieved by gMIMO introduces unique opportunities for energy-efficient, high-capacity communication systems that cater to the demands of 6G wireless networks. Exploiting spherical wave propagation, near-field SWIPT with gMIMO enables precise energy and data delivery, enhancing spectral efficiency through beamfocusing and massive spatial multiplexing. This paper discusses theoretical principles, design challenges, and enabling solutions, including advanced channel estimation techniques, precoding strategies, and dynamic array configurations such as sparse and modular arrays. Through analytical insights and a case study, this paper demonstrates the feasibility of achieving optimized energy harvesting and data throughput in dense and dynamic environments. These findings contribute to advancing energy-autonomous Internet-of-Everything (IoE) deployments, smart factory networks, and other energy-autonomous applications aligned with the goals of next-generation wireless technologies.

Title: Comparative Analysis of QNN Architectures for Wind Power Prediction: Feature Maps and Ansatz Configurations
Authors: Batuhan Hangun, Emine Akpinar, Oguz Altun, Onder Eyecioglu
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging field at the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning, aiming to enhance classical machine learning methods by leveraging quantum mechanics principles such as entanglement and superposition. However, skepticism persists regarding the practical advantages of QML, mainly due to the current limitations of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study addresses these concerns by extensively assessing Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)-quantum-inspired counterparts of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), demonstrating their effectiveness compared to classical methods. We systematically construct and evaluate twelve distinct QNN configurations, utilizing two unique quantum feature maps combined with six different entanglement strategies for ansatz design. Experiments conducted on a wind energy dataset reveal that QNNs employing the Z feature map achieve up to 93% prediction accuracy when forecasting wind power output using only four input parameters. Our findings show that QNNs outperform classical methods in predictive tasks, underscoring the potential of QML in real-world applications.

Title: Finding Optimal Kernel Size and Dimension in Convolutional Neural Networks An Architecture Optimization Approach
Authors: Shreyas Rajeev, B Sathish Babu
Abstract: Kernel size selection in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a critical but often overlooked design decision that affects receptive field, feature extraction, computational cost, and model accuracy. This paper proposes the Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF), a mathematically grounded and empirically validated framework for optimal, layer-wise kernel size determination. BKSEF balances information gain, computational efficiency, and accuracy improvements by integrating principles from information theory, signal processing, and learning theory. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that BKSEF-guided architectures achieve up to 3.1 percent accuracy improvement and 42.8 percent reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models using uniform 3x3 kernels. Two real-world case studies further validate the approach: one for medical image classification in a cloud-based setup, and another for traffic sign recognition on edge devices. The former achieved enhanced interpretability and accuracy, while the latter reduced latency and model size significantly, with minimal accuracy trade-off. These results show that kernel size can be an active, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic. BKSEF provides practical heuristics and theoretical support for researchers and developers seeking efficient and application-aware CNN designs. It is suitable for integration into neural architecture search pipelines and real-time systems, offering a new perspective on CNN optimization.

Title: pycnet-audio: A Python package to support bioacoustics data processing
Authors: Zachary J. Ruff, Damon B. Lesmeister
Abstract: Passive acoustic monitoring is an emerging approach in wildlife research that leverages recent improvements in purpose-made automated recording units (ARUs). The general approach is to deploy ARUs in the field to record on a programmed schedule for extended periods (weeks or months), after which the audio data are retrieved. These data must then be processed, typically either by measuring or analyzing characteristics of the audio itself (e.g. calculating acoustic indices), or by searching for some signal of interest within the recordings, e.g. vocalizations or other sounds produced by some target species, anthropogenic or environmental noise, etc. In the latter case, some method is required to locate the signal(s) of interest within the audio. While very small datasets can simply be searched manually, even modest projects can produce audio datasets on the order of 105 hours of recordings, making manual review impractical and necessitating some form of automated detection. pycnet-audio (Ruff 2024) is intended to provide a practical processing workflow for acoustic data, built around the PNW-Cnet model, which was initially developed by the U.S. Forest Service to support population monitoring of northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) and other forest owls (Lesmeister and Jenkins 2022; Ruff et al. 2020). PNW-Cnet has been expanded to detect vocalizations of ca. 80 forest wildlife species and numerous forms of anthropogenic and environmental noise (Ruff et al. 2021, 2023).

Title: Beyond Universality: Cultural Diversity in Music and Its Implications for Sound Design and Sonification
Authors: RubÃ©n GarcÃ­a-Benito
Abstract: The Audio Mostly (AM) conference has long been a platform for exploring the intersection of sound, technology, and culture. Despite growing interest in sonic cultures, discussions on the role of cultural diversity in sound design and sonification remain limited. This paper investigates the implicit biases and gaps within the discourse on music and sound aesthetics, challenging the notion of music as a 'universal language'. Through a historical and cross-cultural analysis of musicology and ethnomusicology, the profound influence of cultural context on auditory perception and aesthetic appraisal is highlighted. By drawing parallels between historical music practices and contemporary sound design, the paper advocates for a more inclusive approach that recognizes the diversity of sonic traditions. Using music as a case study, we underscore broader implications for sound design and sonification, emphasizing the need to integrate cultural perspectives into auditory design practices. A reevaluation of existing frameworks in sound design and sonification is proposed, emphasizing the necessity of culturally informed practices that resonate with global audiences. Ultimately, embracing cultural diversity in sound design is suggested to lead to richer, more meaningful auditory experiences and to foster greater inclusivity within the field.

Title: A Comparative Evaluation of Deep Learning Models for Speech Enhancement in Real-World Noisy Environments
Authors: Md Jahangir Alam Khondkar, Ajan Ahmed, Masudul Haider Imtiaz, Stephanie Schuckers
Abstract: Speech enhancement, particularly denoising, is vital in improving the intelligibility and quality of speech signals for real-world applications, especially in noisy environments. While prior research has introduced various deep learning models for this purpose, many struggle to balance noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker-specific feature preservation, leaving a critical research gap in their comparative performance evaluation. This study benchmarks three state-of-the-art models Wave-U-Net, CMGAN, and U-Net, on diverse datasets such as SpEAR, VPQAD, and Clarkson datasets. These models were chosen due to their relevance in the literature and code accessibility. The evaluation reveals that U-Net achieves high noise suppression with SNR improvements of +71.96% on SpEAR, +64.83% on VPQAD, and +364.2% on the Clarkson dataset. CMGAN outperforms in perceptual quality, attaining the highest PESQ scores of 4.04 on SpEAR and 1.46 on VPQAD, making it well-suited for applications prioritizing natural and intelligible speech. Wave-U-Net balances these attributes with improvements in speaker-specific feature retention, evidenced by VeriSpeak score gains of +10.84% on SpEAR and +27.38% on VPQAD. This research indicates how advanced methods can optimize trade-offs between noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker recognition. The findings may contribute to advancing voice biometrics, forensic audio analysis, telecommunication, and speaker verification in challenging acoustic conditions.

Title: An accurate and revised version of optical character recognition-based speech synthesis using LabVIEW
Authors: Prateek Mehta, Anasuya Patil
Abstract: Knowledge extraction through sound is a distinctive property. Visually impaired individuals often rely solely on Braille books and audio recordings provided by NGOs. Due to limitations in these approaches, blind individuals often cannot access books of their choice. Speech is a more effective mode of communication than text for blind and visually impaired persons, as they can easily respond to sounds. This paper presents the development of an accurate, reliable, cost-effective, and user-friendly optical character recognition (OCR)-based speech synthesis system. The OCR-based system has been implemented using Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench (LabVIEW).

Title: An Integrated Sensing and Communication System for Time-Sensitive Targets with Random Arrivals
Authors: Homa Nikbakht, Yonina C.Eldar, H.Vincent Poor
Abstract: In 6G networks, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is envisioned as a key technology that enables wireless systems to perform joint sensing and communication using shared hardware, antennas and spectrum. ISAC designs facilitate emerging applications such as smart cities and autonomous driving. Such applications also demand ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC). Thus, an ISAC-enabled URLLC system can prioritize time-sensitive targets and ensure information delivery under strict latency and reliability constraints. We propose a bi-static MIMO ISAC system to detect the arrival of URLLC messages and prioritize their delivery. In this system, a base station (BS) communicates with a user equipment (UE) and a sensing receiver (SR) is deployed to collect echo signals reflected from a target of interest. The BS regularly transmits messages of enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services to the UE. During each eMBB transmission, if the SR senses the presence of a target of interest, it immediately triggers the transmission of an additional URLLC message. To reinforce URLLC transmissions, we propose a dirty-paper coding (DPC)-based technique that mitigates the interference of both eMBB and sensing signals. To decode the eMBB message, we consider two approaches for handling the URLLC interference: treating interference as noise and successive interference cancellation. For this system, we formulate the rate-reliability-detection trade-off in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime by evaluating the communication rate of the eMBB transmissions, the reliability of the URLLC transmissions and the probability of the target detection. Our numerical analysis show that our proposed DPC-based ISAC scheme significantly outperforms power-sharing and traditional time-sharing schemes. In particular, it achieves higher eMBB transmission rate while satisfying both URLLC and sensing constraints.

Title: MIMO Systems Aided by Microwave Linear Analog Computers: Capacity-Achieving Architectures with Reduced Circuit Complexity
Authors: Matteo Nerini, Bruno Clerckx
Abstract: To meet the demands of future wireless networks, antenna arrays must scale from massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) to gigantic MIMO, involving even larger numbers of antennas. To address the hardware and computational cost of gigantic MIMO, several strategies are available that shift processing from the digital to the analog domain. Among them, microwave linear analog computers (MiLACs) offer a compelling solution by enabling fully analog beamforming through reconfigurable microwave networks. Prior work has focused on fully-connected MiLACs, whose ports are all interconnected to each other via tunable impedance components. Although such MiLACs are capacity-achieving, their circuit complexity, given by the number of required impedance components, scales quadratically with the number of antennas, limiting their practicality. To solve this issue, in this paper, we propose a graph theoretical model of MiLAC facilitating the systematic design of lower-complexity MiLAC architectures. Leveraging this model, we propose stem-connected MiLACs as a family of MiLAC architectures maintaining capacity-achieving performance while drastically reducing the circuit complexity. Besides, we optimize stem-connected MiLACs with a closed-form capacity-achieving solution. Our theoretical analysis, confirmed by numerical simulations, shows that stem-connected MiLACs are capacity-achieving, but with circuit complexity that scales linearly with the number of antennas, enabling high-performance, scalable, gigantic MIMO.

Title: CWGAN-GP Augmented CAE for Jamming Detection in 5G-NR in Non-IID Datasets
Authors: Samhita Kuili, Mohammadreza Amini, Burak Kantarci
Abstract: In the ever-expanding domain of 5G-NR wireless cellular networks, over-the-air jamming attacks are prevalent as security attacks, compromising the quality of the received signal. We simulate a jamming environment by incorporating additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) into the real-world In-phase and Quadrature (I/Q) OFDM datasets. A Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) is exploited to implement a jamming detection over various characteristics such as heterogenous I/Q datasets; extracting relevant information on Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSBs), and fewer SSB observations with notable class imbalance. Given the characteristics of datasets, balanced datasets are acquired by employing a Conv1D conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network-Gradient Penalty(CWGAN-GP) on both majority and minority SSB observations. Additionally, we compare the performance and detection ability of the proposed CAE model on augmented datasets with benchmark models: Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder (CDAE) and Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder (CSAE). Despite the complexity of data heterogeneity involved across all datasets, CAE depicts the robustness in detection performance of jammed signal by achieving average values of 97.33% precision, 91.33% recall, 94.08% F1-score, and 94.35% accuracy over CDAE and CSAE.

Title: I Know You're Listening: Adaptive Voice for HRI
Authors: Paige TuttÃ¶sÃ­
Abstract: While the use of social robots for language teaching has been explored, there remains limited work on a task-specific synthesized voices for language teaching robots. Given that language is a verbal task, this gap may have severe consequences for the effectiveness of robots for language teaching tasks. We address this lack of L2 teaching robot voices through three contributions: 1. We address the need for a lightweight and expressive robot voice. Using a fine-tuned version of Matcha-TTS, we use emoji prompting to create an expressive voice that shows a range of expressivity over time. The voice can run in real time with limited compute resources. Through case studies, we found this voice more expressive, socially appropriate, and suitable for long periods of expressive speech, such as storytelling. 2. We explore how to adapt a robot's voice to physical and social ambient environments to deploy our voices in various locations. We found that increasing pitch and pitch rate in noisy and high-energy environments makes the robot's voice appear more appropriate and makes it seem more aware of its current environment. 3. We create an English TTS system with improved clarity for L2 listeners using known linguistic properties of vowels that are difficult for these listeners. We used a data-driven, perception-based approach to understand how L2 speakers use duration cues to interpret challenging words with minimal tense (long) and lax (short) vowels in English. We found that the duration of vowels strongly influences the perception for L2 listeners and created an "L2 clarity mode" for Matcha-TTS that applies a lengthening to tense vowels while leaving lax vowels unchanged. Our clarity mode was found to be more respectful, intelligible, and encouraging than base Matcha-TTS while reducing transcription errors in these challenging tense/lax minimal pairs.

Title: Human Locomotion Implicit Modeling Based Real-Time Gait Phase Estimation
Authors: Yuanlong Ji, Xingbang Yang, Ruoqi Zhao, Qihan Ye, Quan Zheng, Yubo Fan
Abstract: Gait phase estimation based on inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals facilitates precise adaptation of exoskeletons to individual gait variations. However, challenges remain in achieving high accuracy and robustness, particularly during periods of terrain changes. To address this, we develop a gait phase estimation neural network based on implicit modeling of human locomotion, which combines temporal convolution for feature extraction with transformer layers for multi-channel information fusion. A channel-wise masked reconstruction pre-training strategy is proposed, which first treats gait phase state vectors and IMU signals as joint observations of human locomotion, thus enhancing model generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing baseline approaches, achieving a gait phase RMSE of $2.729 \pm 1.071%$ and phase rate MAE of $0.037 \pm 0.016%$ under stable terrain conditions with a look-back window of 2 seconds, and a phase RMSE of $3.215 \pm 1.303%$ and rate MAE of $0.050 \pm 0.023%$ under terrain transitions. Hardware validation on a hip exoskeleton further confirms that the algorithm can reliably identify gait cycles and key events, adapting to various continuous motion scenarios. This research paves the way for more intelligent and adaptive exoskeleton systems, enabling safer and more efficient human-robot interaction across diverse real-world environments.

Title: SonicVerse: Multi-Task Learning for Music Feature-Informed Captioning
Authors: Anuradha Chopra, Abhinaba Roy, Dorien Herremans
Abstract: Detailed captions that accurately reflect the characteristics of a music piece can enrich music databases and drive forward research in music AI. This paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model. To train the model, we extended the MusicBench dataset by annotating it with music features using MIRFLEX, a modular music feature extractor, resulting in paired audio, captions and music feature data. Experimental results show that incorporating features in this way improves the quality and detail of the generated captions.

Title: In-Context Learning for Gradient-Free Receiver Adaptation: Principles, Applications, and Theory
Authors: Matteo Zecchin, Tomer Raviv, Dileep Kalathil, Krishna Narayanan, Nir Shlezinger, Osvaldo Simeone
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has facilitated the creation of wireless receivers capable of functioning effectively in conditions that challenge traditional model-based designs. Leveraging programmable hardware architectures, deep learning-based receivers offer the potential to dynamically adapt to varying channel environments. However, current adaptation strategies, including joint training, hypernetwork-based methods, and meta-learning, either demonstrate limited flexibility or necessitate explicit optimization through gradient descent. This paper presents gradient-free adaptation techniques rooted in the emerging paradigm of in-context learning (ICL). We review architectural frameworks for ICL based on Transformer models and structured state-space models (SSMs), alongside theoretical insights into how sequence models effectively learn adaptation from contextual information. Further, we explore the application of ICL to cell-free massive MIMO networks, providing both theoretical analyses and empirical evidence. Our findings indicate that ICL represents a principled and efficient approach to real-time receiver adaptation using pilot signals and auxiliary contextual information-without requiring online retraining.

Title: Joint Computation Offloading and Resource Allocation for Uncertain Maritime MEC via Cooperation of UAVs and Vessels
Authors: Jiahao You, Ziye Jia, Chao Dong, Qihui Wu, Zhu Han
Abstract: The computation demands from the maritime Internet of Things (MIoT) increase rapidly in recent years, and the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and vessels based multi-access edge computing (MEC) can fulfill these MIoT requirements. However, the uncertain maritime tasks present significant challenges of inefficient computation offloading and resource allocation. In this paper, we focus on the maritime computation offloading and resource allocation through the cooperation of UAVs and vessels, with consideration of uncertain tasks. Specifically, we propose a cooperative MEC framework for computation offloading and resource allocation, including MIoT devices, UAVs and vessels. Then, we formulate the optimization problem to minimize the total execution time. As for the uncertain MIoT tasks, we leverage Lyapunov optimization to tackle the unpredictable task arrivals and varying computational resource availability.  By converting the long-term constraints into short-term constraints, we obtain a set of small-scale optimization problems. Further, considering the heterogeneity of actions and resources of UAVs and vessels, we reformulate the small-scale optimization problem into a Markov game (MG). Moreover, a heterogeneous-agent soft actor-critic is proposed to sequentially update various neural networks and effectively solve the MG problem.  Finally, simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness in addressing computational offloading and resource allocation.

Title: MSNeRV: Neural Video Representation with Multi-Scale Feature Fusion
Authors: Jun Zhu, Xinfeng Zhang, Lv Tang, JunHao Jiang
Abstract: Implicit Neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising approach for video compression, and have achieved comparable performance to the state-of-the-art codecs such as H.266/VVC. However, existing INR-based methods struggle to effectively represent detail-intensive and fast-changing video content. This limitation mainly stems from the underutilization of internal network features and the absence of video-specific considerations in network design. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion framework, MSNeRV, for neural video representation. In the encoding stage, we enhance temporal consistency by employing temporal windows, and divide the video into multiple Groups of Pictures (GoPs), where a GoP-level grid is used for background representation. Additionally, we design a multi-scale spatial decoder with a scale-adaptive loss function to integrate multi-resolution and multi-frequency information. To further improve feature extraction, we introduce a multi-scale feature block that fully leverages hidden features. We evaluate MSNeRV on HEVC ClassB and UVG datasets for video representation and compression. Experimental results demonstrate that our model exhibits superior representation capability among INR-based approaches and surpasses VTM-23.7 (Random Access) in dynamic scenarios in terms of compression efficiency.

Title: Comparison of Innovative Strategies for the Coverage Problem: Path Planning, Search Optimization, and Applications in Underwater Robotics
Authors: Ahmed Ibrahim, Francisco F. C. Rego, Ãric Busvelle
Abstract: In many applications, including underwater robotics, the coverage problem requires an autonomous vehicle to systematically explore a defined area while minimizing redundancy and avoiding obstacles. This paper investigates coverage path planning strategies to enhance the efficiency of underwater gliders, particularly in maximizing the probability of detecting a radioactive source while ensuring safe navigation. We evaluate three path-planning approaches: the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), and Optimal Control Problem (OCP). Simulations were conducted in MATLAB, comparing processing time, uncovered areas, path length, and traversal time. Results indicate that OCP is preferable when traversal time is constrained, although it incurs significantly higher computational costs. Conversely, MST-based approaches provide faster but less optimal solutions. These findings offer insights into selecting appropriate algorithms based on mission priorities, balancing efficiency and computational feasibility.

Title: Exploiting Music Source Separation for Automatic Lyrics Transcription with Whisper
Authors: Jaza Syed, Ivan Meresman Higgs, OndÅej CÃ­fka, Mark Sandler
Abstract: Automatic lyrics transcription (ALT) remains a challenging task in the field of music information retrieval, despite great advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) brought about by transformer-based architectures in recent years. One of the major challenges in ALT is the high amplitude of interfering audio signals relative to conventional ASR due to musical accompaniment. Recent advances in music source separation have enabled automatic extraction of high-quality separated vocals, which could potentially improve ALT performance. However, the effect of source separation has not been systematically investigated in order to establish best practices for its use. This work examines the impact of source separation on ALT using Whisper, a state-of-the-art open source ASR model. We evaluate Whisper's performance on original audio, separated vocals, and vocal stems across short-form and long-form transcription tasks. For short-form, we suggest a concatenation method that results in a consistent reduction in Word Error Rate (WER). For long-form, we propose an algorithm using source separation as a vocal activity detector to derive segment boundaries, which results in a consistent reduction in WER relative to Whisper's native long-form algorithm. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for an open source system on the Jam-ALT long-form ALT benchmark, without any training or fine-tuning. We also publish MUSDB-ALT, the first dataset of long-form lyric transcripts following the Jam-ALT guidelines for which vocal stems are publicly available.

Title: On Exact Solutions to the Linear Bellman Equation
Authors: David Ohlin, Richard Pates, Murat Arcak
Abstract: This paper presents sufficient conditions for optimal control of systems with dynamics given by a linear operator, in order to obtain an explicit solution to the Bellman equation that can be calculated in a distributed fashion. Further, the class of Linearly Solvable MDP is reformulated as a continuous-state optimal control problem. It is shown that this class naturally satisfies the conditions for explicit solution of the Bellman equation, motivating the extension of previous results to semilinear dynamics to account for input nonlinearities. The applicability of the given conditions is illustrated in scenarios with linear and quadratic cost, corresponding to the Stochastic Shortest Path and Linear-Quadratic Regulator problems.

Title: Diff-TONE: Timestep Optimization for iNstrument Editing in Text-to-Music Diffusion Models
Authors: Teysir Baoueb, Xiaoyu Bie, Xi Wang, GaÃ«l Richard
Abstract: Breakthroughs in text-to-music generation models are transforming the creative landscape, equipping musicians with innovative tools for composition and experimentation like never before. However, controlling the generation process to achieve a specific desired outcome remains a significant challenge. Even a minor change in the text prompt, combined with the same random seed, can drastically alter the generated piece. In this paper, we explore the application of existing text-to-music diffusion models for instrument editing. Specifically, for an existing audio track, we aim to leverage a pretrained text-to-music diffusion model to edit the instrument while preserving the underlying content. Based on the insight that the model first focuses on the overall structure or content of the audio, then adds instrument information, and finally refines the quality, we show that selecting a well-chosen intermediate timestep, identified through an instrument classifier, yields a balance between preserving the original piece's content and achieving the desired timbre. Our method does not require additional training of the text-to-music diffusion model, nor does it compromise the generation process's speed.

Title: PredGen: Accelerated Inference of Large Language Models through Input-Time Speculation for Real-Time Speech Interaction
Authors: Shufan Li, Aditya Grover
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence, which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation that would otherwise go unused.

Title: Trajectory Optimization for Cellular-Enabled UAV with Connectivity and Battery Constraints
Authors: Hyeon-Seong Im, Kyu-Yeong Kim, Si-Hyeon Lee
Abstract: We address the path planning problem for a cellular-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) considering both connectivity and battery constraints. The UAV's mission is to expeditiously transport a payload from an initial point to a final point, while persistently keeping the connection with a base station and complying with its battery limit. At a charging station, the UAV's depleted battery can be swapped with a completely charged one. Our primary contribution lies in proposing an algorithm that outputs an optimal UAV trajectory with polynomial computational complexity, by converting the problem into an equivalent two-level graph-theoretic shortest path search problem. We compare our algorithm with several existing algorithms with respect to performance and computational complexity, and show that only our algorithm outputs an optimal UAV trajectory in polynomial time. Furthermore, we consider other objectives of minimizing the UAV energy consumption and of maximizing the deliverable payload weight, and propose algorithms that output an optimal UAV trajectory in polynomial time.

Title: Bayesian KalmanNet: Quantifying Uncertainty in Deep Learning Augmented Kalman Filter
Authors: Yehonatan Dahan, Guy Revach, Jindrich Dunik, Nir Shlezinger
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in tracking algorithms that augment Kalman Filters (KFs) with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). By transforming KFs into trainable deep learning models, one can learn from data to reliably track a latent state in complex and partially known dynamics. However, unlike classic KFs, conventional DNN-based systems do not naturally provide an uncertainty measure, such as error covariance, alongside their estimates, which is crucial in various applications that rely on KF-type tracking. This work bridges this gap by studying error covariance extraction in DNN-aided KFs. We begin by characterizing how uncertainty can be extracted from existing DNN-aided algorithms and distinguishing between approaches by their ability to associate internal features with meaningful KF quantities, such as the Kalman Gain (KG) and prior covariance. We then identify that uncertainty extraction from existing architectures necessitates additional domain knowledge not required for state estimation. Based on this insight, we propose Bayesian KalmanNet, a novel DNN-aided KF that integrates Bayesian deep learning techniques with the recently proposed KalmanNet and transforms the KF into a stochastic machine learning architecture. This architecture employs sampling techniques to predict error covariance reliably without requiring additional domain knowledge, while retaining KalmanNet's ability to accurately track in partially known dynamics. Our numerical study demonstrates that Bayesian KalmanNet provides accurate and reliable tracking in various scenarios representing partially known dynamic systems.

Title: Enforcing contraction via data
Authors: Zhongjie Hu, Claudio De Persis, Pietro Tesi
Abstract: We present data-based conditions for enforcing contractivity via feedback control and obtain desired asymptotic properties of the closed-loop system. We focus on unknown nonlinear control systems whose vector fields are expressible via a dictionary of functions and derive data-dependent semidefinite programs whose solution returns the controller that guarantees contractivity. When data are perturbed by disturbances that are linear combinations of sinusoids of known frequencies (but unknown amplitude and phase) and constants, we remarkably obtain conditions for contractivity that do not depend on the magnitude of the disturbances, with imaginable positive consequences for the synthesis of the controller. Finally, we show how to design from data an integral controller for nonlinear systems that achieves constant reference tracking and constant disturbance rejection.

Title: ATFusion: An Alternate Cross-Attention Transformer Network for Infrared and Visible Image Fusion
Authors: Han Yan, Songlei Xiong, Long Wang, Lihua Jian, Gemine Vivone
Abstract: The fusion of infrared and visible images is essential in remote sensing applications, as it combines the thermal information of infrared images with the detailed texture of visible images for more accurate analysis in tasks like environmental monitoring, target detection, and disaster management. The current fusion methods based on Transformer techniques for infrared and visible (IV) images have exhibited promising performance. However, the attention mechanism of the previous Transformer-based methods was prone to extract common information from source images without considering the discrepancy information, which limited fusion performance. In this paper, by reevaluating the cross-attention mechanism, we propose an alternate Transformer fusion network (ATFusion) to fuse IV images. Our ATFusion consists of one discrepancy information injection module (DIIM) and two alternate common information injection modules (ACIIM). The DIIM is designed by modifying the vanilla cross-attention mechanism, which can promote the extraction of the discrepancy information of the source images. Meanwhile, the ACIIM is devised by alternately using the vanilla cross-attention mechanism, which can fully mine common information and integrate long dependencies. Moreover, the successful training of ATFusion is facilitated by a proposed segmented pixel loss function, which provides a good trade-off for texture detail and salient structure preservation. The qualitative and quantitative results on public datasets indicate our ATFusion is effective and superior compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Distributionally Robust Receive Combining
Authors: Shixiong Wang, Wei Dai, Geoffrey Ye Li
Abstract: This article investigates signal estimation in wireless transmission (i.e., receive combining) from the perspective of statistical machine learning, where the transmit signals may be from an integrated sensing and communication system; that is, 1) signals may be not only discrete constellation points but also arbitrary complex values; 2) signals may be spatially correlated. Particular attention is paid to handling various uncertainties such as the uncertainty of the transmit signal covariance, the uncertainty of the channel matrix, the uncertainty of the channel noise covariance, the existence of channel impulse noises, the non-ideality of the power amplifiers, and the limited sample size of pilots. To proceed, a distributionally robust receive combining framework that is insensitive to the above uncertainties is proposed, which reveals that channel estimation is not a necessary operation. For optimal linear estimation, the proposed framework includes several existing combiners as special cases such as diagonal loading and eigenvalue thresholding. For optimal nonlinear estimation, estimators are limited in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and neural network function spaces, and corresponding uncertainty-aware solutions (e.g., kernelized diagonal loading) are derived. In addition, we prove that the ridge and kernel ridge regression methods in machine learning are distributionally robust against diagonal perturbation in feature covariance.

Title: I2I-Mamba: Multi-modal medical image synthesis via selective state space modeling
Authors: Omer F. Atli, Bilal Kabas, Fuat Arslan, Arda C. Demirtas, Mahmut Yurt, Onat Dalmaz, Tolga Ãukur
Abstract: Multi-modal medical image synthesis involves nonlinear transformation of tissue signals between source and target modalities, where tissues exhibit contextual interactions across diverse spatial distances. As such, the utility of a network architecture in synthesis depends on its ability to express these contextual features. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer high local precision at the expense of poor sensitivity to long-range context. While transformers promise to alleviate this issue, they suffer from an unfavorable trade-off between sensitivity to long- versus short-range context due to the intrinsic complexity of attention filters. To effectively capture contextual features while avoiding the complexity-driven trade-offs, here we introduce a novel multi-modal synthesis method, I2I-Mamba, based on the state space modeling (SSM) framework. Focusing on semantic representations across a hybrid residual architecture, I2I-Mamba leverages novel dual-domain Mamba (ddMamba) blocks for complementary contextual modeling in image and Fourier domains, while maintaining spatial precision with convolutional layers. Diverting from conventional raster-scan trajectories, ddMamba leverages novel SSM operators based on a spiral-scan trajectory to learn context with enhanced radial coverage and angular isotropy, and a channel-mixing layer to aggregate context across the channel dimension. Comprehensive demonstrations on multi-contrast MRI and MRI-CT protocols indicate that I2I-Mamba offers superior performance against state-of-the-art CNNs, transformers and SSMs.

Title: Joint Observer Gain and Input Design for Asymptotic Active Fault Diagnosis
Authors: Feng Xu, Yiming Wan, Ye Wang, Vicenc Puig
Abstract: This paper proposes a joint gain and input design method for observer-based asymptotic active fault diagnosis, which is based on a newly-defined notion named the excluding degree of the origin from a zonotope. Using the excluding degree, a quantitative specification is obtained to characterize the performance of set-based robust fault diagnosis. Furthermore, a single gain design method and a joint gain and input design method are proposed, respectively. This is the first work to achieve a joint observer gain and input design for set-based active fault diagnosis. Compared with the existing methods that design gains and input separately, the proposed joint gain and input design method has advantages to exploit the fault diagnosis potential of observer-based schemes. Finally, several examples are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Title: Cooperative Integrated Sensing and Communication Networks: Analysis and Distributed Design
Authors: Bowen Wang, Hongyu Li, Fan Liu, Ziyang Cheng, Shanpu Shen
Abstract: This paper proposes a cooperative integrated sensing and communication network (Co-ISACNet) adopting hybrid beamforming (HBF) architecture, which improves both radar sensing and communication performance. The main contributions of this work are four-fold. First, we introduce a novel cooperative sensing method for the considered Co-ISACNet, followed by a comprehensive analysis of this method. This analysis mathematically verifies the benefits of Co-ISACNet and provides insightful design guidelines. Second, to show the benefits of Co-ISACNet, we propose to jointly design the HBF to maximize the network communication capacity while satisfying the constraint of beampattern similarity for radar sensing, which results in a highly dimensional and non-convex problem. Third, to facilitate the joint design, we propose a novel distributed optimization framework based on proximal gradient and alternating direction method of multipliers, namely PANDA. Fourth, we further adopt the proposed PANDA framework to solve the joint HBF design problem for the Co-ISACNet. By using the proposed PANDA framework, all access points (APs) optimize the HBF in parallel, where each AP only requires local channel state information and limited message exchange among the APs. Such framework reduces significantly the computational complexity and thus has pronounced benefits in practical scenarios. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared with the conventional centralized algorithm and show the remarkable performance improvement of radar sensing and communication by deploying Co-ISACNet.

Title: Toward Near-Globally Optimal Nonlinear Model Predictive Control via Diffusion Models
Authors: Tzu-Yuan Huang, Armin Lederer, Nicolas Hoischen, Jan BrÃ¼digam, Xuehua Xiao, Stefan Sosnowski, Sandra Hirche
Abstract: Achieving global optimality in nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is challenging due to the non-convex nature of the underlying optimization problem. Since commonly employed local optimization techniques depend on carefully chosen initial guesses, this non-convexity often leads to suboptimal performance resulting from local optima. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel diffusion model-based approach for near-globally optimal NMPC consisting of an offline and an online phase. The offline phase employs a local optimizer to sample from the distribution of optimal NMPC control sequences along generated system trajectories through random initial guesses. Subsequently, the generated diverse dataset is used to train a diffusion model to reflect the multi-modal distribution of optima. In the online phase, the trained model is leveraged to efficiently perform a variant of random shooting optimization to obtain near-globally optimal control sequences without relying on any initial guesses or online NMPC solving. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated in a numerical simulation indicating high performance benefits compared to direct neural network approximations of NMPC and significantly lower computation times than online solving NMPC using global optimizers.

Title: Integrating Cascade Pumped Micro-Hydro Storage: A Sustainable Approach to Energy and Water Management
Authors: Oraib Dawaghreh, Sharaf K. Magableh, Xuesong Wang, Mohammad Adnan Magableh, Caisheng Wang
Abstract: As traditional large hydropower has been extensively exploited, micro-hydro systems have caught research increasing interest. New engineering challenges arise in developing micro-hydro systems in areas with significant elevation but prohibitive horizontal distances between primary reservoirs. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a cascade-pumped micro-hydro storage (CPMHS) system that leverages intermediate reservoirs to bridge long horizontal distances, enabling efficient energy transfer and storage. The methodology utilizes naturally occurring lakes with substantial head heights but limited feasibility for direct pumped storage due to horizontal separations. Integrating smaller, strategically placed intermediate reservoirs maximizes energy capture along the cascading path, making pumped storage viable in geographically constrained locations. The proposed system will enhance energy generation potential and provide additional benefits for water management. Using geographical data and a detailed case study focused on Mountain Lake and surrounding lakes, this paper demonstrates the energy efficiency and viability of cascade-based micro-hydro storage. A practical methodology for implementing CPMHS systems is proposed and validated by case studies. An optimization framework is developed for efficient energy capture in regions with challenging topography.

Title: Detecting Neurocognitive Disorders through Analyses of Topic Evolution and Cross-modal Consistency in Visual-Stimulated Narratives
Authors: Jinchao Li, Yuejiao Wang, Junan Li, Jiawen Kang, Bo Zheng, Simon Wong, Brian Mak, Helene Fung, Jean Woo, Man-Wai Mak, Timothy Kwok, Vincent Mok, Xianmin Gong, Xixin Wu, Xunying Liu, Patrick Wong, Helen Meng
Abstract: Early detection of neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) is crucial for timely intervention and disease management. Given that language impairments manifest early in NCD progression, visual-stimulated narrative (VSN)-based analysis offers a promising avenue for NCD detection. Current VSN-based NCD detection methods primarily focus on linguistic microstructures (e.g., pauses, lexical diversity), which are potentially linked to bottom-up (stimulus-driven) cognitive processing. While these features illuminate basic language abilities, the higher-order linguistic macrostructures (e.g., thematic or logical development), which may reflect top-down (concept-driven) cognitive abilities, remain underexplored. These patterns are crucial for NCD detection yet challenging to quantify due to their abstract and complex nature. To bridge this gap, we propose two novel dynamic macrostructural approaches: (1) Dynamic Topic Model (DTM) to track topic evolution over time, and (2) Text-Image Temporal Alignment Network (TITAN) to measure cross-modal consistency between speech and visual stimuli. Experimental results validated the efficiency of proposed approaches in NCD detection, with TITAN achieving superior performance both on the CU-MARVEL-RABBIT corpus (F1 = 0.7238) and the ADReSS corpus (F1 = 0.8889). The feature contribution analysis revealed that macrostructural features (e.g., topic variability, topic change rate, and topic consistency) constituted the most significant contributors in the model's decision pathways, outperforming investigated microstructural features. These findings underscore the critical role of macrostructural patterns in understanding cognitive impairment mechanisms in NCDs.

Title: Convergent Primal-Dual Plug-and-Play Image Restoration: A General Algorithm and Applications
Authors: Yodai Suzuki, Ryosuke Isono, Shunsuke Ono
Abstract: We propose a general deep plug-and-play (PnP) algorithm with a theoretical convergence guarantee. PnP strategies have demonstrated outstanding performance in various image restoration tasks by exploiting the powerful priors underlying Gaussian denoisers. However, existing PnP methods often lack theoretical convergence guarantees under realistic assumptions due to their ad-hoc nature, resulting in inconsistent behavior. Moreover, even when convergence guarantees are provided, they are typically designed for specific settings or require a considerable computational cost in handling non-quadratic data-fidelity terms and additional constraints, which are key components in many image restoration scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we integrate the PnP paradigm with primal-dual splitting (PDS), an efficient proximal splitting methodology for solving a wide range of convex optimization problems, and develop a general convergent PnP framework. Specifically, we establish theoretical conditions for the convergence of the proposed PnP algorithm under a reasonable assumption. Furthermore, we show that the problem solved by the proposed PnP algorithm is not a standard convex optimization problem but a more general monotone inclusion problem, where we provide a mathematical representation of the solution set. Our approach efficiently handles a broad class of image restoration problems with guaranteed theoretical convergence. Numerical experiments on specific image restoration tasks validate the practicality and effectiveness of our theoretical results.

Title: CISSIR: Beam Codebooks with Self-Interference Reduction Guarantees for Integrated Sensing and Communication Beyond 5G
Authors: Rodrigo HernangÃ³mez, Jochen Fink, Renato L. G. Cavalcante, SÅawomir StaÅczak
Abstract: We propose a beam codebook design to reduce self-interference (SI) in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Our optimization methods, which can be applied to both tapered beamforming and phased arrays, adapt the codebooks to the SI channel such that a certain SI level is achieved. Furthermore, we derive an upper bound on the quantization noise in terms of the achieved SI level, which provides guidelines to pose the optimization problem in order to obtain performance guarantees for sensing. By selecting standard reference codebooks in our simulations, we show substantially improved sensing quality with little impact on 5G-NR communication. Our proposed method is not only less dependent on hyperparameters than other approaches in the literature, but it can also reduce SI further, and thus deliver better sensing and communication performance.

Title: A Synergy Scoring Filter for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection with Noisy Data
Authors: Chengming Liu, Fengjie Wang, Lei Shi, Zhe Zhao
Abstract: Noise-inclusive fully unsupervised anomaly detection (FUAD) holds significant practical relevance. Although various methods exist to address this problem, they are limited in both performance and scalability. Our work seeks to overcome these obstacles, enabling broader adaptability of unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) models to FUAD. To achieve this, we introduce the Synergy Scoring Filter (SSFilter), the first fully unsupervised anomaly detection approach to leverage sample-level filtering. SSFilter facilitates end-to-end robust training and applies filtering to the complete training set post-training, offering a model-agnostic solution for FUAD. Specifically, SSFilter integrates a batch-level anomaly scoring mechanism based on mutual patch comparison and utilizes regression errors in anomalous regions, alongside prediction uncertainty, to estimate sample-level uncertainty scores that calibrate the anomaly scoring mechanism. This design produces a synergistic, robust filtering approach. Furthermore, we propose a realistic anomaly synthesis method and an integrity enhancement strategy to improve model training and mitigate missed noisy samples. Our method establishes state-of-the-art performance on the FUAD benchmark of the recent large-scale industrial anomaly detection dataset, Real-IAD. Additionally, dataset-level filtering enhances the performance of various UAD methods on the FUAD benchmark, and the high scalability of our approach significantly boosts its practical applicability.

Title: Modeling, Analysis, and Optimization of Cascaded Power Amplifiers
Authors: Oksana Moryakova, Thomas Eriksson, HÃ¥kan Johansson
Abstract: This paper deals with modeling, analysis, and optimization of power amplifiers (PAs) placed in a cascaded structure, particularly the effect of cascaded nonlinearities is studied by showing potential ways to minimize the total nonlinearities. The nonlinear least-squares algorithm is proposed to optimize the PA parameters along with the input power level, and thereby minimize the total nonlinearities in the cascaded structure. The simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the optimized configurations for up to five PAs using the proposed framework can improve the linearity properties of the overall cascade.

Title: Low-Complexity Channel Estimation Protocol for Non-Diagonal RIS-Assisted Communications
Authors: Mostafa Samy, Hayder Al-Hraishawi, Abuzar B. M. Adam, Madyan Alsenwi, Symeon Chatzinotas, BjÃ¶rn Otteresten
Abstract: Non-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer enhanced wireless signal manipulation over conventional RIS by enabling the incident signal on any of its $M$ elements to be reflected from another element via an $M \times M$ switch array. To fully exploit this flexible configuration, the acquisition of individual channel state information (CSI) is essential. However, due to the passive nature of the RIS, cascaded channel estimation is performed, as the RIS itself lacks signal processing capabilities. This entails estimating the CSI for the $M \times M$ switch array cascaded channels, resulting in estimating $M^2$ coefficients, to identify the optimal configuration of the non-diagonal RIS that maximizes the channel gain. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity channel estimation protocol that substantially reduces the estimation overhead from the exhaustive $M^2$ coefficients to only $3M$ coefficients for both single-input single-output (SISO) and multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems. Specifically, a three-stage pilot-based protocol is proposed to estimate scaled versions of the user-RIS and RIS-base-station (BS) channels in the first two stages using the least square (LS) estimator and the commonly used ON/OFF protocol for conventional RIS. These scaled estimates enable the optimization of the switch array. In the third stage, the cascaded user-RIS-BS channels are estimated to enable efficient beamforming optimization. Complexity analysis shows that our proposed protocol significantly reduces the BS estimation complexity from $\mathcal{O}(NM^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(NM)$, where $N$ is the number of BS antennas. This complexity is similar to the ON/OFF-based LS estimation for conventional diagonal RIS.

Title: Ophora: A Large-Scale Data-Driven Text-Guided Ophthalmic Surgical Video Generation Model
Authors: Wei Li, Ming Hu, Guoan Wang, Lihao Liu, Kaijin Zhou, Junzhi Ning, Xin Guo, Zongyuan Ge, Lixu Gu, Junjun He
Abstract: In ophthalmic surgery, developing an AI system capable of interpreting surgical videos and predicting subsequent operations requires numerous ophthalmic surgical videos with high-quality annotations, which are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns and labor consumption. Text-guided video generation (T2V) emerges as a promising solution to overcome this issue by generating ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. In this paper, we present Ophora, a pioneering model that can generate ophthalmic surgical videos following natural language instructions. To construct Ophora, we first propose a Comprehensive Data Curation pipeline to convert narrative ophthalmic surgical videos into a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising over 160K video-instruction pairs, Ophora-160K. Then, we propose a Progressive Video-Instruction Tuning scheme to transfer rich spatial-temporal knowledge from a T2V model pre-trained on natural video-text datasets for privacy-preserved ophthalmic surgical video generation based on Ophora-160K. Experiments on video quality evaluation via quantitative analysis and ophthalmologist feedback demonstrate that Ophora can generate realistic and reliable ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. We also validate the capability of Ophora for empowering downstream tasks of ophthalmic surgical workflow understanding. Code is available at this https URL.

Title: Prediction of the Conditional Probability Densities of Time Interval Extrema with Application to Risk-Sensitive Scheduling
Authors: Buyi Yu, Wenyuan Tang
Abstract: Planning and scheduling activities in the electrical power system, such as the commitment of reserve generation, often involve the statistical characterization of peak demand. Due to the stationarity assumption of classical extreme value analysis (EVA), existing approaches in the industry apply EVA on simulated annual peaks created by weather-dependent surrogate models using Monte-Carlo simulations on a per-scenario basis. In day-ahead scheduling, the daily peak demand changes upon various factors besides temperature, Monte-Carlo experiments become intractable, and state-of-the-art generalized additive model for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS)-based nonstationary EVA is often impractical due to convergence issues on high-dimensional covariates. This article explores uncharted territories and proposes a novel nonstationary EVA estimator that predicts the probable peaks of high-resolution time intervals and their corresponding conditional probability densities based on calendar information and weather conditions where historical peaks are observed. Compared to GAMLSS, our method automatically discovers and robustly models complex relationships between the covariate and the peak demand density. We present a case study on the determination of day-ahead scheduling capacity and demonstrate that compared to the industry approach, our approach results in a 38% reduction in the yearly total committed capacity while maintaining the given risk requirement.

Title: Optimizing Battery and Line Undergrounding Investments for Transmission Systems under Wildfire Risk Scenarios: A Benders Decomposition Approach
Authors: Ryan Piansky, Rahul K. Gupta, Daniel K. Molzahn
Abstract: With electric power infrastructure posing an increasing risk of igniting wildfires under continuing climate change, utilities are frequently de-energizing power lines to mitigate wildfire ignition risk, which can cause load shedding. Recent research advocates for installing battery energy storage systems as well as undergrounding risky overhead lines to reduce the load shedding during such de-energizations. Since wildfire ignition risk can exhibit substantial geographic and temporal variations, it is important to plan battery installation and line undergrounding investments while considering multiple possible scenarios. This paper presents a scenario-based framework for optimizing battery installation and line undergrounding investments while considering many scenarios, each consisting of a day-long time series of uncertain parameters for the load demand, renewable generation, and wildfire ignition risks. This problem is difficult to solve due to a large number of scenarios and binary variables associated with the battery placements as well as the lines to be undergrounded. To address the computational challenges, we decompose the problem in a two-stage scheme via a Benders decomposition approach. The first stage is a master problem formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that makes decisions on the locations and sizes of batteries as well as the lines to be undergrounded. The second stage consists of a linear programming model that assesses these battery and line undergrounding decisions as modeled by a DC OPF formulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme on a large-scale transmission network with real world data on wildfire ignition risks, load, and renewable generation.

Title: Decoding Saccadic Eye Movements from Brain Signals Using an Endovascular Neural Interface
Authors: Suleman Rasheed, James Bennett, Peter E. Yoo, Anthony N. Burkitt, David B. Grayden
Abstract: An Oculomotor Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) records neural activity from regions of the brain involved in planning eye movements and translates this activity into control commands. While previous successful oculomotor BCI studies primarily relied on invasive microelectrode implants in non-human primates, this study investigates the feasibility of an oculomotor BCI using a minimally invasive endovascular Stentrode device implanted near the supplementary motor area in a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To achieve this, self-paced visually-guided and free-viewing saccade tasks were designed, in which the participant performed saccades in four directions (left, right, up, down), with simultaneous recording of endovascular EEG and eye gaze. The visually guided saccades were cued with visual stimuli, whereas the free-viewing saccades were self-directed without explicit cues. The results showed that while the neural responses of visually guided saccades overlapped with the cue-evoked potentials, the free-viewing saccades exhibited distinct saccade-related potentials that began shortly before eye movement, peaked approximately 50 ms after saccade onset, and persisted for around 200 ms. In the frequency domain, these responses appeared as a low-frequency synchronisation below 15 Hz. Classification of 'fixation vs. saccade' was robust, achieving mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores of 0.88 within sessions and 0.86 between sessions. In contrast, classifying saccade direction proved more challenging, yielding within-session AUC scores of 0.67 for four-class decoding and up to 0.75 for the best-performing binary comparisons (left vs. up and left vs. down). This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of an endovascular oculomotor BCI in an ALS patient, establishing a foundation for future oculomotor BCI studies in human subjects.

Title: Computation Capacity Maximization for Pinching Antennas-Assisted Wireless Powered MEC Systems
Authors: Peng Liu, Meng Hua, Guangji Chen, Xinyi Wang, Zesong Fei
Abstract: In this paper,we investigate a novel wireless powered mobile edge computing (MEC) system assisted by pinching antennas (PAs), where devices first harvest energy from a base station and then offload computation-intensive tasks to an MEC server. As an emerging technology, PAs utilize long dielectric waveguides embedded with multiple localized dielectric particles, which can be spatially configured through a pinching mechanism to effectively reduce large-scale propagation loss. This capability facilitates both efficient downlink energy transfer and uplink task offloading. To fully exploit these advantages, we adopt a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) framework and formulate a joint optimization problem to maximize the system's computational capacity by jointly optimizing device transmit power, time allocation, PA positions in both uplink and downlink, and radiation control. To address the resulting non-convexity caused by variable coupling, we develop an alternating optimization algorithm that integrates particle swarm optimization (PSO) with successive convex approximation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PA-assisted design substantially improves both energy harvesting efficiency and computational performance compared to conventional antenna systems.

Title: Receiving RISs: Enabling Channel Estimation and Autonomous Configuration
Authors: George C. Alexandropoulos, Konstantinos D. Katsanos, Evangelos Vlachos
Abstract: This chapter focuses on a hardware architecture for semi-passive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) and investigates its consideration for boosting the performance of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communication systems. The architecture incorporates a single or multiple radio-frequency chains to receive pilot signals via tunable absorption phase profiles realized by the metasurface front end, as well as a controller encompassing a baseband processing unit to carry out channel estimation, and consequently, the optimization of the RIS reflection coefficients. A novel channel estimation protocol, according to which the RIS receives non-orthogonal training pilot sequences from two multi-antenna terminals via tunable absorption phase profiles, and then, estimates the respective channels via its signal processing unit, is presented. The channel estimates are particularly used by the RIS controller to design the capacity-achieving reflection phase configuration of the metasurface front end. The proposed channel estimation algorithm, which is based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), profits from the RIS random spatial absorption sampling to capture the entire signal space, and exploits the beamspace sparsity and low-rank properties of extremely large MIMO channels, which is particularly relevant for communication systems at the FR3 band and above. Our extensive numerical investigations showcase the superiority of the proposed channel estimation technique over benchmark schemes for various system and RIS hardware configuration parameters, as well as the effectiveness of using channel estimates at the RIS side to dynamically optimize the possibly phase-quantized reflection coefficients of its unit elements.

Title: Wasserstein-Barycenter Consensus for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Ali Baheri
Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) demands principled mechanisms to align heterogeneous policies while preserving the capacity for specialized behavior. We introduce a novel consensus framework that defines the team strategy as the entropic-regularized $p$-Wasserstein barycenter of agents' joint state--action visitation measures. By augmenting each agent's policy objective with a soft penalty proportional to its Sinkhorn divergence from this barycenter, the proposed approach encourages coherent group behavior without enforcing rigid parameter sharing. We derive an algorithm that alternates between Sinkhorn-barycenter computation and policy-gradient updates, and we prove that, under standard Lipschitz and compactness assumptions, the maximal pairwise policy discrepancy contracts at a geometric rate. Empirical evaluation on a cooperative navigation case study demonstrates that our OT-barycenter consensus outperforms an independent learners baseline in convergence speed and final coordination success.

Title: A Smooshed BMOCZ Zero Constellation for CFO Estimation Without Channel Coding
Authors: Anthony Joseph Perre, Parker Huggins, Alphan Sahin
Abstract: In this study, we propose a new binary modulation on conjugate-reciprocal zeros (BMOCZ) zero constellation, which we call smooshed binary modulation on conjugate-reciprocal zeros (SBMOCZ), to address carrier frequency offset (CFO)-induced zero rotation without depending on channel coding. In our approach, we modify the phase mapping of Huffman BMOCZ by shrinking the angle between adjacent zeros, except for the first and last, to introduce a gap in the zero constellation. By discerning the gap location in the received polynomial, the receiver can estimate and correct the phase rotation. We demonstrate the error rate performance of SBMOCZ relative to Huffman BMOCZ, showing that SBMOCZ addresses a CFO-induced rotation at the cost of a modest performance reduction compared to Huffman BMOCZ in the absence of a CFO. Finally, we compare SBMOCZ to Huffman BMOCZ using a cyclically permutable code (CPC), showing a 4 dB bit error rate (BER) improvement in a fading channel, while demonstrating comparable performance across other simulations.

Title: PRO: Projection Domain Synthesis for CT Imaging
Authors: Kang Chen, Bin Huang, Xuebin Yang, Junyan Zhang, Qiegen Liu
Abstract: Synthesizing high quality CT projection data remains a significant challenge due to the limited availability of annotated data and the complex nature of CT imaging. In this work, we present PRO, a projection domain synthesis foundation model for CT imaging. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that performs CT synthesis in the projection domain. Unlike previous approaches that operate in the image domain, PRO learns rich structural representations from raw projection data and leverages anatomical text prompts for controllable synthesis. This projection domain strategy enables more faithful modeling of underlying imaging physics and anatomical structures. Moreover, PRO functions as a foundation model, capable of generalizing across diverse downstream tasks by adjusting its generative behavior via prompt inputs. Experimental results demonstrated that incorporating our synthesized data significantly improves performance across multiple downstream tasks, including low-dose and sparse-view reconstruction. These findings underscore the versatility and scalability of PRO in data generation for various CT applications. These results highlight the potential of projection domain synthesis as a powerful tool for data augmentation and robust CT imaging. Our source code is publicly available at: this https URL.

Title: MERGE -- A Bimodal Audio-Lyrics Dataset for Static Music Emotion Recognition
Authors: Pedro Lima Louro, Hugo Redinho, Ricardo Santos, Ricardo Malheiro, Renato Panda, Rui Pedro Paiva
Abstract: The Music Emotion Recognition (MER) field has seen steady developments in recent years, with contributions from feature engineering, machine learning, and deep learning. The landscape has also shifted from audio-centric systems to bimodal ensembles that combine audio and lyrics. However, a lack of public, sizable and quality-controlled bimodal databases has hampered the development and improvement of bimodal audio-lyrics systems. This article proposes three new audio, lyrics, and bimodal MER research datasets, collectively referred to as MERGE, which were created using a semi-automatic approach. To comprehensively assess the proposed datasets and establish a baseline for benchmarking, we conducted several experiments for each modality, using feature engineering, machine learning, and deep learning methodologies. Additionally, we propose and validate fixed train-validation-test splits. The obtained results confirm the viability of the proposed datasets, achieving the best overall result of 81.74\% F1-score for bimodal classification.

Title: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Aided Vehicular Edge Computing: Joint Phase-shift Optimization and Multi-User Power Allocation
Authors: Kangwei Qi, Qiong Wu, Pingyi Fan, Nan Cheng, Wen Chen, Khaled B. Letaief
Abstract: Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is an emerging technology with significant potential in the field of internet of vehicles (IoV), enabling vehicles to perform intensive computational tasks locally or offload them to nearby edge devices. However, the quality of communication links may be severely deteriorated due to obstacles such as buildings, impeding the offloading process. To address this challenge, we introduce the use of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS), which provide alternative communication pathways to assist vehicular communication. By dynamically adjusting the phase-shift of the RIS, the performance of VEC systems can be substantially improved. In this work, we consider a RIS-assisted VEC system, and design an optimal scheme for local execution power, offloading power, and RIS phase-shift, where random task arrivals and channel variations are taken into account. To address the scheme, we propose an innovative deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that combines the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm for optimizing RIS phase-shift coefficients and the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm for optimizing the power allocation of vehicle user (VU). Simulation results show that our proposed scheme outperforms the traditional centralized DDPG, Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) and some typical stochastic schemes.

Title: EnergyDiff: Universal Time-Series Energy Data Generation using Diffusion Models
Authors: Nan Lin, Peter Palensky, Pedro P. Vergara
Abstract: High-resolution time series data are crucial for the operation and planning of energy systems such as electrical power systems and heating systems. Such data often cannot be shared due to privacy concerns, necessitating the use of synthetic data. However, high-resolution time series data is difficult to model due to its inherent high dimensionality and complex temporal dependencies. Leveraging the recent development of generative AI, especially diffusion models, we propose EnergyDiff, a universal data generation framework for energy time series data. EnergyDiff builds on state-of-the-art denoising diffusion probabilistic models, utilizing a proposed denoising network dedicated to high-resolution time series data and introducing a novel Marginal Calibration technique. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that EnergyDiff achieves significant improvement in capturing the temporal dependencies and marginal distributions compared to baselines, particularly at the 1-minute resolution. EnergyDiff's universality is validated across diverse energy domains (e.g., electricity demand, heat pump, PV, multiple time resolutions (1 minute, 15 minutes, 30 minutes and 1 hour), and at both customer and transformer levels.

Title: A Convex-Nonconvex Framework for Enhancing Minimization Induced Penalties
Authors: Hiroki Kuroda
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for nonconvex enhancement of minimization induced (MI) penalties while preserving the overall convexity of associated regularization models. MI penalties enable the adaptation to certain signal structures via minimization, but often underestimate significant components owing to convexity. To overcome this shortcoming, we design a generalized Moreau enhanced minimization induced (GME-MI) penalty by subtracting from the MI penalty its generalized Moreau envelope. While the proposed GME-MI penalty is nonconvex in general, we derive an overall convexity condition for the GME-MI regularized least-squares model. Moreover, we present a proximal splitting algorithm with guaranteed convergence to a globally optimal solution of the GME-MI model under the overall convexity condition. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution to address the limitations of centralised machine learning (ML) in oncology, particularly in overcoming privacy concerns and harnessing the power of diverse, multi-center data. This systematic review synthesises current knowledge on the state-of-the-art FL in oncology, focusing on breast, lung, and prostate cancer. Distinct from previous surveys, our comprehensive review critically evaluates the real-world implementation and impact of FL on cancer care, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing ML generalisability, performance and data privacy in clinical settings and data. We evaluated state-of-the-art advances in FL, demonstrating its growing adoption amid tightening data privacy regulations. FL outperformed centralised ML in 15 out of the 25 studies reviewed, spanning diverse ML models and clinical applications, and facilitating integration of multi-modal information for precision medicine. Despite the current challenges identified in reproducibility, standardisation and methodology across studies, the demonstrable benefits of FL in harnessing real-world data and addressing clinical needs highlight its significant potential for advancing cancer research. We propose that future research should focus on addressing these limitations and investigating further advanced FL methods, to fully harness data diversity and realise the transformative power of cutting-edge FL in cancer care.

Title: Multiclass Post-Earthquake Building Assessment Integrating High-Resolution Optical and SAR Satellite Imagery, Ground Motion, and Soil Data with Transformers
Authors: Deepank Singh, Vedhus Hoskere, Pietro Milillo
Abstract: Timely and accurate assessments of building damage are crucial for effective response and recovery in the aftermath of earthquakes. Conventional preliminary damage assessments (PDA) often rely on manual door-to-door inspections, which are not only time-consuming but also pose significant safety risks. To safely expedite the PDA process, researchers have studied the applicability of satellite imagery processed with heuristic and machine learning approaches. These approaches output binary or, more recently, multiclass damage states at the scale of a block or a single building. However, the current performance of such approaches limits practical applicability. To address this limitation, we introduce a metadata-enriched, transformer based framework that combines high-resolution post-earthquake satellite imagery with building-specific metadata relevant to the seismic performance of the structure. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiclass post-earthquake damage identification for buildings from the Turkey-Syria earthquake on February 6, 2023. Specifically, we demonstrate that incorporating metadata, such as seismic intensity indicators, soil properties, and SAR damage proxy maps not only enhances the model's accuracy and ability to distinguish between damage classes, but also improves its generalizability across various regions. Furthermore, we conducted a detailed, class-wise analysis of feature importance to understand the model's decision-making across different levels of building damage. This analysis reveals how individual metadata features uniquely contribute to predictions for each damage class. By leveraging both satellite imagery and metadata, our proposed framework enables faster and more accurate damage assessments for precise, multiclass, building-level evaluations that can improve disaster response and accelerate recovery efforts for affected communities.

Title: Sequential Change Detection for Learning in Piecewise Stationary Bandit Environments
Authors: Yu-Han Huang, Venugopal V. Veeravalli
Abstract: A finite-horizon variant of the quickest change detection problem is investigated, which is motivated by a change detection problem that arises in piecewise stationary bandits. The goal is to minimize the \emph{latency}, which is smallest threshold such that the probability that the detection delay exceeds the threshold is below a desired low level, while controlling the false alarm probability to a desired low level. When the pre- and post-change distributions are unknown, two tests are proposed as candidate solutions. These tests are shown to attain order optimality in terms of the horizon. Furthermore, the growth in their latencies with respect to the false alarm probability and late detection probability satisfies a property that is desirable in regret analysis for piecewise stationary bandits. Numerical results are provided to validate the theoretical performance results.

Title: A Survey on Semantic Communications in Internet of Vehicles
Authors: Sha Ye, Qiong Wu, Pingyi Fan, Qiang Fan
Abstract: Internet of Vehicles (IoV), as the core of intelligent transportation system, enables comprehensive interconnection between vehicles and their surroundings through multiple communication modes, which is significant for autonomous driving and intelligent traffic management. However, with the emergence of new applications, traditional communication technologies face the problems of scarce spectrum resources and high latency. Semantic communication, which focuses on extracting, transmitting, and recovering some useful semantic information from messages, can reduce redundant data transmission, improve spectrum utilization, and provide innovative solutions to communication challenges in the IoV. This paper systematically reviews state of art of semantic communications in the IoV, elaborates the technical background of IoV and semantic communications, and deeply discusses key technologies of semantic communications in IoV, including semantic information extraction, semantic communication architecture, resource allocation and management, and so on. Through specific case studies, it demonstrates that semantic communications can be effectively employed in the scenarios of traffic environment perception and understanding, intelligent driving decision support, IoV service optimization, and intelligent traffic management. Additionally, it analyzes the current challenges and future research directions. This survey reveals that semantic communications has broad application prospects in IoV, but it is necessary to solve the real existing problems by combining advanced technologies to promote its wide application in IoV and contributing to the development of intelligent transportation system.

Title: Mass-Adaptive Admittance Control for Robotic Manipulators
Authors: Hossein Gholampour, Jonathon E. Slightam, Logan E. Beaver
Abstract: Handling objects with unknown or changing masses is a common challenge in robotics, often leading to errors or instability if the control system cannot adapt in real-time. In this paper, we present a novel approach that enables a six-degrees-of-freedom robotic manipulator to reliably follow waypoints while automatically estimating and compensating for unknown payload weight. Our method integrates an admittance control framework with a mass estimator, allowing the robot to dynamically update an excitation force to compensate for the payload mass. This strategy mitigates end-effector sagging and preserves stability when handling objects of unknown weights. We experimentally validated our approach in a challenging pick-and-place task on a shelf with a crossbar, improved accuracy in reaching waypoints and compliant motion compared to a baseline admittance-control scheme. By safely accommodating unknown payloads, our work enhances flexibility in robotic automation and represents a significant step forward in adaptive control for uncertain environments.

Title: TSLFormer: A Lightweight Transformer Model for Turkish Sign Language Recognition Using Skeletal Landmarks
Authors: Kutay ErtÃ¼rk, Furkan AltÄ±nÄ±ÅÄ±k, Ä°rem SarÄ±altÄ±n, Ãmer Nezih Gerek
Abstract: This study presents TSLFormer, a light and robust word-level Turkish Sign Language (TSL) recognition model that treats sign gestures as ordered, string-like language. Instead of using raw RGB or depth videos, our method only works with 3D joint positions - articulation points - extracted using Google's Mediapipe library, which focuses on the hand and torso skeletal locations. This creates efficient input dimensionality reduction while preserving important semantic gesture information. Our approach revisits sign language recognition as sequence-to-sequence translation, inspired by the linguistic nature of sign languages and the success of transformers in natural language processing. Since TSLFormer uses the self-attention mechanism, it effectively captures temporal co-occurrence within gesture sequences and highlights meaningful motion patterns as words unfold. Evaluated on the AUTSL dataset with over 36,000 samples and 227 different words, TSLFormer achieves competitive performance with minimal computational cost. These results show that joint-based input is sufficient for enabling real-time, mobile, and assistive communication systems for hearing-impaired individuals.

Title: Graph Neural Networks for Jamming Source Localization
Authors: Dania Herzalla, Willian T. Lunardi, Martin Andreoni
Abstract: Graph-based learning provides a powerful framework for modeling complex relational structures; however, its application within the domain of wireless security remains significantly underexplored. In this work, we introduce the first application of graph-based learning for jamming source localization, addressing the imminent threat of jamming attacks in wireless networks. Unlike geometric optimization techniques that struggle under environmental uncertainties and dense interference, we reformulate the localization as an inductive graph regression task. Our approach integrates structured node representations that encode local and global signal aggregation, ensuring spatial coherence and adaptive signal fusion. To enhance robustness, we incorporate an attention-based \ac{GNN} that adaptively refines neighborhood influence and introduces a confidence-guided estimation mechanism that dynamically balances learned predictions with domain-informed priors. We evaluate our approach under complex \ac{RF} environments with various sampling densities, network topologies, jammer characteristics, and signal propagation conditions, conducting comprehensive ablation studies on graph construction, feature selection, and pooling strategies. Results demonstrate that our novel graph-based learning framework significantly outperforms established localization baselines, particularly in challenging scenarios with sparse and obfuscated signal information.

Title: Video-Guided Text-to-Music Generation Using Public Domain Movie Collections
Authors: Haven Kim, Zachary Novack, Weihan Xu, Julian McAuley, Hao-Wen Dong
Abstract: Despite recent advancements in music generation systems, their application in film production remains limited, as they struggle to capture the nuances of real-world filmmaking, where filmmakers consider multiple factors-such as visual content, dialogue, and emotional tone-when selecting or composing music for a scene. This limitation primarily stems from the absence of comprehensive datasets that integrate these elements. To address this gap, we introduce Open Screen Sound Library (OSSL), a dataset consisting of movie clips from public domain films, totaling approximately 36.5 hours, paired with high-quality soundtracks and human-annotated mood information. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset in improving the performance of pre-trained models on film music generation tasks, we introduce a new video adapter that enhances an autoregressive transformer-based text-to-music model by adding video-based conditioning. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively enhances MusicGen-Medium in terms of both objective measures of distributional and paired fidelity, and subjective compatibility in mood and genre. The dataset and code are available at this https URL.

Title: Seewo's Submission to MLC-SLM: Lessons learned from Speech Reasoning Language Models
Authors: Bo Li, Chengben Xu, Wufeng Zhang
Abstract: This paper presents Seewo's systems for both tracks of the Multilingual Conversational Speech Language Model Challenge (MLC-SLM), addressing automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speaker diarization with ASR (SD-ASR). We introduce a multi-stage training pipeline that explicitly enhances reasoning and self-correction in speech language models for ASR. Our approach combines curriculum learning for progressive capability acquisition, Chain-of-Thought data augmentation to foster intermediate reflection, and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to further refine self-correction through reward-driven optimization. This approach achieves substantial improvements over the official challenge baselines. On the evaluation set, our best system attains a WER/CER of 11.57% for Track 1 and a tcpWER/tcpCER of 17.67% for Track 2. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each component under challenge constraints.

Title: From Data-Driven to Purpose-Driven Artificial Intelligence: Systems Thinking for Data-Analytic Automation of Patient Care
Authors: Daniel Anadria, Roel Dobbe, Anastasia Giachanou, Ruurd Kuiper, Richard Bartels, Wouter van Amsterdam, ÃÃ±igo MartÃ­nez de Rituerto de Troya, Carmen ZÃ¼rcher, Daniel Oberski
Abstract: In this work, we reflect on the data-driven modeling paradigm that is gaining ground in AI-driven automation of patient care. We argue that the repurposing of existing real-world patient datasets for machine learning may not always represent an optimal approach to model development as it could lead to undesirable outcomes in patient care. We reflect on the history of data analysis to explain how the data-driven paradigm rose to popularity, and we envision ways in which systems thinking and clinical domain theory could complement the existing model development approaches in reaching human-centric outcomes. We call for a purpose-driven machine learning paradigm that is grounded in clinical theory and the sociotechnical realities of real-world operational contexts. We argue that understanding the utility of existing patient datasets requires looking in two directions: upstream towards the data generation, and downstream towards the automation objectives. This purpose-driven perspective to AI system development opens up new methodological opportunities and holds promise for AI automation of patient care.
