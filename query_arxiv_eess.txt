Title: ASAudio: A Survey of Advanced Spatial Audio Research
Authors: Zhiyuan Zhu, Yu Zhang, Wenxiang Guo, Changhao Pan, Zhou Zhao
Abstract: With the rapid development of spatial audio technologies today, applications in AR, VR, and other scenarios have garnered extensive attention. Unlike traditional mono sound, spatial audio offers a more realistic and immersive auditory experience. Despite notable progress in the field, there remains a lack of comprehensive surveys that systematically organize and analyze these methods and their underlying technologies. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of spatial audio and systematically review recent literature in the area. To address this, we chronologically outlining existing work related to spatial audio and categorize these studies based on input-output representations, as well as generation and understanding tasks, thereby summarizing various research aspects of spatial audio. In addition, we review related datasets, evaluation metrics, and benchmarks, offering insights from both training and evaluation perspectives. Related materials are available at this https URL.

Title: CleanCTG: A Deep Learning Model for Multi-Artefact Detection and Reconstruction in Cardiotocography
Authors: Sheng Wong, Beth Albert, Gabriel Davis Jones
Abstract: Cardiotocography (CTG) is essential for fetal monitoring but is frequently compromised by diverse artefacts which obscure true fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns and can lead to misdiagnosis or delayed intervention. Current deep-learning approaches typically bypass comprehensive noise handling, applying minimal preprocessing or focusing solely on downstream classification, while traditional methods rely on simple interpolation or rule-based filtering that addresses only missing samples and fail to correct complex artefact types. We present CleanCTG, an end-to-end dual-stage model that first identifies multiple artefact types via multi-scale convolution and context-aware cross-attention, then reconstructs corrupted segments through artefact-specific correction branches. Training utilised over 800,000 minutes of physiologically realistic, synthetically corrupted CTGs derived from expert-verified "clean" recordings. On synthetic data, CleanCTG achieved perfect artefact detection (AU-ROC = 1.00) and reduced mean squared error (MSE) on corrupted segments to 2.74 x 10^-4 (clean-segment MSE = 2.40 x 10^-6), outperforming the next best method by more than 60%. External validation on 10,190 minutes of clinician-annotated segments yielded AU-ROC = 0.95 (sensitivity = 83.44%, specificity 94.22%), surpassing six comparator classifiers. Finally, when integrated with the Dawes-Redman system on 933 clinical CTG recordings, denoised traces increased specificity (from 80.70% to 82.70%) and shortened median time to decision by 33%. These findings suggest that explicit artefact removal and signal reconstruction can both maintain diagnostic accuracy and enable shorter monitoring sessions, offering a practical route to more reliable CTG interpretation.

Title: The Role of Radiographic Knee Alignment in Knee Replacement Outcomes and Opportunities for Artificial Intelligence-Driven Assessment
Authors: Zhisen Hu, David S. Johnson, Aleksei Tiulpin, Timothy F. Cootes, Claudia Lindner
Abstract: Prevalent knee osteoarthritis (OA) imposes substantial burden on health systems with no cure available. Its ultimate treatment is total knee replacement (TKR). Complications from surgery and recovery are difficult to predict in advance, and numerous factors may affect them. Radiographic knee alignment is one of the key factors that impacts TKR outcomes, affecting outcomes such as postoperative pain or function. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has been introduced to the automatic analysis of knee radiographs, for example, to automate knee alignment measurements. Existing review articles tend to focus on knee OA diagnosis and segmentation of bones or cartilages in MRI rather than exploring knee alignment biomarkers for TKR outcomes and their assessment. In this review, we first examine the current scoring protocols for evaluating TKR outcomes and potential knee alignment biomarkers associated with these outcomes. We then discuss existing AI-based approaches for generating knee alignment biomarkers from knee radiographs, and explore future directions for knee alignment assessment and TKR outcome prediction.

Title: Deep Learning-Based Automated Segmentation of Uterine Myomas
Authors: Tausifa Jan Saleem, Mohammad Yaqub
Abstract: Uterine fibroids (myomas) are the most common benign tumors of the female reproductive system, particularly among women of childbearing age. With a prevalence exceeding 70%, they pose a significant burden on female reproductive health. Clinical symptoms such as abnormal uterine bleeding, infertility, pelvic pain, and pressure-related discomfort play a crucial role in guiding treatment decisions, which are largely influenced by the size, number, and anatomical location of the fibroids. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive and highly accurate imaging modality commonly used by clinicians for the diagnosis of uterine fibroids. Segmenting uterine fibroids requires a precise assessment of both the uterus and fibroids on MRI scans, including measurements of volume, shape, and spatial location. However, this process is labor intensive and time consuming and subjected to variability due to intra- and inter-expert differences at both pre- and post-treatment stages. As a result, there is a critical need for an accurate and automated segmentation method for uterine fibroids. In recent years, deep learning algorithms have shown re-markable improvements in medical image segmentation, outperforming traditional methods. These approaches offer the potential for fully automated segmentation. Several studies have explored the use of deep learning models to achieve automated segmentation of uterine fibroids. However, most of the previous work has been conducted using private datasets, which poses challenges for validation and comparison between studies. In this study, we leverage the publicly available Uterine Myoma MRI Dataset (UMD) to establish a baseline for automated segmentation of uterine fibroids, enabling standardized evaluation and facilitating future research in this domain.

Title: Overview of Complex System Design
Authors: John W. Sheppard
Abstract: This chapter serves as an introduction to systems engineering focused on the broad issues surrounding realizing complex integrated systems. What is a system? We pose a number of possible definitions and perspectives, but leave open the opportunity to consider the system from the target context where it will be used. Once we have a system in mind, we acknowledge the fact that this system needs to integrate a variety of pieces, components, subsystems, in order for it to accomplish its task. Therefore, we concern ourselves at the boundaries and interfaces of different technologies and disciplines to determine how best to achieve that integration. Next we raise the specter that this integrated system is complex. Complexity can be defined in a number of ways. For one, the sheer number of subsystems or components can be a measure of complexity. We could also consider the functions being performed by the system and how those functions interact with one another. Further, we could consider computational aspects such as the time or memory that may be needed to accomplish one or more tasks. The extent to which new behaviors might emerge from the system can also be regarded as an element of complexity. In the end, complexity is that characteristic of a system that defines the associated challenges along the life of the system, so we are concerned with how to manage that complexity. Finally, realization refers to the process by which our complex integrated system moves from concept to deployment and subsequent support. It refers to the entire design, development, manufacture, deployment, operation, and support life cycle. Of particular note here, however, is that we focus on systems that, by their very nature, are complex. In other words, we are interested in large, complicated, interacting beasts that are intended to perform difficult tasks and meet a wide variety of end-user needs.

Title: Distributed Integrated Sensing, Localization, and Communications over LEO Satellite Constellations
Authors: Yuchen Zhang, Francis Soualle, Musa Furkan Keskin, Yuan Liu, Linlong Wu, Jos√© A. del Peral-Rosado, Bhavani Shankar M. R., Gonzalo Seco-Granados, Henk Wymeersch, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri
Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations are rapidly becoming essential enablers of next-generation wireless systems, offering global broadband access, high-precision localization, and reliable sensing beyond terrestrial coverage. However, the inherent limitations of individual LEO satellites, including restricted power, limited antenna aperture, and constrained onboard processing, hinder their ability to meet the growing demands of 6G applications. To address these challenges, this article introduces the concept of distributed integrated sensing, localization, and communication (DISLAC) over LEO constellations, inspired by distributed multiple input multiple output architectures. By enabling inter-satellite cooperation through inter-satellite links, DISLAC can substantially improve throughput, positioning accuracy, and sensing robustness. We present illustrative case studies that quantify these benefits and analyze key system-level considerations, including synchronization, antenna reconfigurability, and ISL design. The article concludes by outlining open research directions to advance the practical deployment of DISLAC in future non-terrestrial networks.

Title: Risk-Based Prognostics and Health Management
Authors: John W. Sheppard
Abstract: It is often the case that risk assessment and prognostics are viewed as related but separate tasks. This chapter describes a risk-based approach to prognostics that seeks to provide a tighter coupling between risk assessment and fault prediction. We show how this can be achieved using the continuous-time Bayesian network as the underlying modeling framework. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the techniques that are available to derive these models from data and show how they might be used in practice to achieve tasks like decision support and performance-based logistics. This work is intended to provide an overview of the recent developments related to risk-based prognostics, and we hope that it will serve as a tutorial of sorts that will assist others in adopting these techniques.

Title: A Neural Column-and-Constraint Generation Method for Solving Two-Stage Stochastic Unit Commitment
Authors: Zhentong Shao, Jingtao Qin, Nanpeng Yu
Abstract: Two-stage stochastic unit commitment (2S-SUC) problems have been widely adopted to manage the uncertainties introduced by high penetrations of intermittent renewable energy resources. While decomposition-based algorithms such as column-and-constraint generation has been proposed to solve these problems, they remain computationally prohibitive for large-scale, real-time applications. In this paper, we introduce a Neural Column-and-Constraint Generation (Neural CCG) method to significantly accelerate the solution of 2S-SUC problems. The proposed approach integrates a neural network that approximates the second-stage recourse problem by learning from high-level features of operational scenarios and the first-stage commitment decisions. This neural estimator is embedded within the CCG framework, replacing repeated subproblem solving with rapid neural evaluations. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the IEEE 118-bus system. Compared to the original CCG and a state-of-the-art commercial solver, Neural CCG achieves up to 130.1$\times$ speedup while maintaining a mean optimality gap below 0.096\%, demonstrating its strong potential for scalable stochastic optimization in power system.

Title: Managing Risks from Large Digital Loads Using Coordinated Grid-Forming Storage Network
Authors: Soumya Kundu, Kaustav Chatterjee, Ramij R. Hossain, Sai Pushpak Nandanoori, Veronica Adetola
Abstract: Anticipated rapid growth of large digital load, driven by artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, is poised to increase uncertainty and large fluctuations in consumption, threatening the stability, reliability, and security of the energy infrastructure. Conventional measures taken by grid planners and operators to ensure stable and reliable integration of new resources are either cost-prohibitive (e.g., transmission upgrades) or ill-equipped (e.g., generation control) to resolve the unique challenges brought on by AI Data Centers (e.g., extreme load transients). In this work, we explore the feasibility of coordinating and managing available flexibility in the grid, in terms of grid-forming storage units, to ensure stable and reliable integration of AI Data Centers without the need for costly grid upgrades. Recently developed bi-layered coordinated control strategies -- involving fast-acting, local, autonomous, control at the storage to maintain transient safety in voltage and frequency at the point-of-interconnection, and a slower, coordinated (consensus) control to restore normal operating condition in the grid -- are used in the case studies. A comparison is drawn between broadly two scenarios: a network of coordinated, smaller, distributed storage vs. larger storage installations collocated with large digital loads. IEEE 68-bus network is used for the case studies, with large digital load profiles drawn from the MIT Supercloud Dataset.

Title: Multi-Satellite Cooperative MIMO Transmission: Statistical CSI-Aware RSMA Precoding Design
Authors: Sangwon Jo, Seok-Hwan Park
Abstract: We investigate inter-satellite cooperative transmission in a multiple low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication system to enhance spectral efficiency. Specifically, we design multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) precoding at LEO satellites for cooperative rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). Given the difficulty of acquiring instantaneous channel state information (iCSI) due to long delays and Doppler effects, we formulate an ergodic max-min fairness rate (MMFR) maximization problem based on statistical CSI (sCSI). To address the challenge of ergodic rate evaluation, we approximate the problem using closed-form upper bounds and develop a weighted minimum mean squared error-based algorithm to obtain a stationary point. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed sCSI-based RSMA scheme approaches iCSI-based performance and significantly outperforms conventional space-division multiple access.

Title: Near-Field Variable-Width Beam Coverage and Codebook Design for XL-RIS
Authors: Yida Zhang, Qiuyan Liu, Qiang Wang, Hongtao Luo, Yuqi Xia
Abstract: To mitigate the issue of limited base station coverage caused by severe high-frequency electromagnetic wave attenuation, Extremely Large Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (XL-RIS) has garnered significant attention due to its high beam gain. However, XL-RIS exhibits a narrower beam width compared to traditional RIS, which increases the complexity of beam alignment and broadcast. To address this problem, we propose a variable-width beam generation algorithm under the near-field assumption and apply it to the near-field codebook design for XL-RIS. Our algorithm can achieve beam coverage for arbitrarily shaped codeword regions and generate a joint codebook for the multi-XL-RIS system. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme enables user equipment (UE) to achieve higher spectral efficiency and lower communication outage probability within the codeword region compared to existing works. Furthermore, our scheme exhibits better robustness to codeword region location and area variations.

Title: HistoViT: Vision Transformer for Accurate and Scalable Histopathological Cancer Diagnosis
Authors: Faisal Ahmed
Abstract: Accurate and scalable cancer diagnosis remains a critical challenge in modern pathology, particularly for malignancies such as breast, prostate, bone, and cervical, which exhibit complex histological variability. In this study, we propose a transformer-based deep learning framework for multi-class tumor classification in histopathological images. Leveraging a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, our method addresses key limitations of conventional convolutional neural networks, offering improved performance, reduced preprocessing requirements, and enhanced scalability across tissue types. To adapt the model for histopathological cancer images, we implement a streamlined preprocessing pipeline that converts tiled whole-slide images into PyTorch tensors and standardizes them through data normalization. This ensures compatibility with the ViT architecture and enhances both convergence stability and overall classification performance. We evaluate our model on four benchmark datasets: ICIAR2018 (breast), SICAPv2 (prostate), UT-Osteosarcoma (bone), and SipakMed (cervical) dataset -- demonstrating consistent outperformance over existing deep learning methods. Our approach achieves classification accuracies of 99.32%, 96.92%, 95.28%, and 96.94% for breast, prostate, bone, and cervical cancers respectively, with area under the ROC curve (AUC) scores exceeding 99% across all datasets. These results confirm the robustness, generalizability, and clinical potential of transformer-based architectures in digital pathology. Our work represents a significant advancement toward reliable, automated, and interpretable cancer diagnosis systems that can alleviate diagnostic burdens and improve healthcare outcomes.

Title: KAN-HAR: A Human activity recognition based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Network
Authors: Mohammad Alikhani
Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a critical role in numerous applications, including healthcare monitoring, fitness tracking, and smart environments. Traditional deep learning (DL) approaches, while effective, often require extensive parameter tuning and may lack interpretability. In this work, we investigate the use of a single three-axis accelerometer and the Kolmogorov--Arnold Network (KAN) for HAR tasks, leveraging its ability to model complex nonlinear relationships with improved interpretability and parameter efficiency. The MotionSense dataset, containing smartphone-based motion sensor signals across various physical activities, is employed to evaluate the proposed approach. Our methodology involves preprocessing and normalization of accelerometer and gyroscope data, followed by KAN-based feature learning and classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the KAN achieves competitive or superior classification performance compared to conventional deep neural networks, while maintaining a significantly reduced parameter count. This highlights the potential of KAN architectures as an efficient and interpretable alternative for real-world HAR systems. The open-source implementation of the proposed framework is available at the Project's GitHub Repository.

Title: Expressive Speech Retrieval using Natural Language Descriptions of Speaking Style
Authors: Wonjune Kang, Deb Roy
Abstract: We introduce the task of expressive speech retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve speech utterances spoken in a given style based on a natural language description of that style. While prior work has primarily focused on performing speech retrieval based on what was said in an utterance, we aim to do so based on how something was said. We train speech and text encoders to embed speech and text descriptions of speaking styles into a joint latent space, which enables using free-form text prompts describing emotions or styles as queries to retrieve matching expressive speech segments. We perform detailed analyses of various aspects of our proposed framework, including encoder architectures, training criteria for effective cross-modal alignment, and prompt augmentation for improved generalization to arbitrary text queries. Experiments on multiple datasets encompassing 22 speaking styles demonstrate that our approach achieves strong retrieval performance as measured by Recall@k.

Title: Efficient Image-to-Image Schr√∂dinger Bridge for CT Field of View Extension
Authors: Zhenhao Li, Long Yang, Xiaojie Yin, Haijun Yu, Jiazhou Wang, Hongbin Han, Weigang Hu, Yixing Huang
Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is a cornerstone imaging modality for non-invasive, high-resolution visualization of internal anatomical structures. However, when the scanned object exceeds the scanner's field of view (FOV), projection data are truncated, resulting in incomplete reconstructions and pronounced artifacts near FOV boundaries. Conventional reconstruction algorithms struggle to recover accurate anatomy from such data, limiting clinical reliability. Deep learning approaches have been explored for FOV extension, with diffusion generative models representing the latest advances in image synthesis. Yet, conventional diffusion models are computationally demanding and slow at inference due to their iterative sampling process. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient CT FOV extension framework based on the image-to-image Schr√∂dinger Bridge (I$^2$SB) diffusion model. Unlike traditional diffusion models that synthesize images from pure Gaussian noise, I$^2$SB learns a direct stochastic mapping between paired limited-FOV and extended-FOV images. This direct correspondence yields a more interpretable and traceable generative process, enhancing anatomical consistency and structural fidelity in reconstructions. I$^2$SB achieves superior quantitative performance, with root-mean-square error (RMSE) values of 49.8\,HU on simulated noisy data and 152.0HU on real data, outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion models such as conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models (cDDPM) and patch-based diffusion methods. Moreover, its one-step inference enables reconstruction in just 0.19s per 2D slice, representing over a 700-fold speedup compared to cDDPM (135s) and surpassing diffusionGAN (0.58s), the second fastest. This combination of accuracy and efficiency makes I$^2$SB highly suitable for real-time or clinical deployment.

Title: A Convergent Generalized Krylov Subspace Method for Compressed Sensing MRI Reconstruction with Gradient-Driven Denoisers
Authors: Tao Hong, Umberto Villa, Jeffrey A. Fessler
Abstract: Model-based reconstruction plays a key role in compressed sensing (CS) MRI, as it incorporates effective image regularizers to improve the quality of reconstruction. The Plug-and-Play and Regularization-by-Denoising frameworks leverage advanced denoisers (e.g., convolutional neural network (CNN)-based denoisers) and have demonstrated strong empirical performance. However, their theoretical guarantees remain limited, as practical CNNs often violate key assumptions. In contrast, gradient-driven denoisers achieve competitive performance, and the required assumptions for theoretical analysis are easily satisfied. However, solving the associated optimization problem remains computationally demanding. To address this challenge, we propose a generalized Krylov subspace method (GKSM) to solve the optimization problem efficiently. Moreover, we also establish rigorous convergence guarantees for GKSM in nonconvex settings. Numerical experiments on CS MRI reconstruction with spiral and radial acquisitions validate both the computational efficiency of GKSM and the accuracy of the theoretical predictions. The proposed optimization method is applicable to any linear inverse problem.

Title: Enabling low-power massive MIMO with ternary ADCs for AIoT sensing
Authors: Shengheng Liu, Ningning Fu
Abstract: The proliferation of networked devices and the surging demand for ubiquitous intelligence have given rise to the artificial intelligence of things (AIoT). However, the utilization of high-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and numerous radio frequency chains significantly raises power consumption. This paper explores a cost-effective solution using ternary ADCs (T-ADCs) in massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems for low-power AIoT and specifically addresses channel sensing challenges. The channel is first estimated through a pilot-aided scheme and refined using a joint-pilot-and-data (JPD) approach. To assess the performance limits of this two-threshold ADC system, the analysis includes its hardware-ideal counterpart, the parallel one-bit ADCs (PO-ADCs) and a realistic scenario where noise variance is unknown at the receiver is considered. Analytical findings indicate that the JPD scheme effectively mitigates performance degradation in channel estimation due to coarse quantization effects under mild conditions, without necessitating additional pilot overhead. For deterministic and random channels, we propose modified expectation maximization (EM) and variational inference EM estimators, respectively. Extensive simulations validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimators in terms of mean square error and symbol error rate, which showcases the feasibility of implementing T-ADCs and the associated JPD scheme for greener AIoT smart sensing.

Title: Temporally-Similar Structure-Aware Spatiotemporal Fusion of Satellite Images
Authors: Ryosuke Isono, Shunsuke Ono
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel spatiotemporal (ST) fusion framework for satellite images, named Temporally-Similar Structure-Aware ST fusion (TSSTF). ST fusion is a promising approach to address the trade-off between the spatial and temporal resolution of satellite images. In real-world scenarios, observed satellite images are severely degraded by noise due to measurement equipment and environmental conditions. Consequently, some recent studies have focused on enhancing the robustness of ST fusion methods against noise. However, existing noise-robust ST fusion approaches often fail to capture fine spatial structure, leading to oversmoothing and artifacts. To address this issue, TSSTF introduces two key mechanisms: Temporally-Guided Total Variation (TGTV) and Temporally-Guided Edge Constraint (TGEC). TGTV is a novel regularization function that promotes spatial piecewise smoothness while preserving structural details, guided by a reference high spatial resolution image acquired on a nearby date. TGEC enforces consistency in edge locations between two temporally adjacent images, while allowing for spectral variations. We formulate the ST fusion task as a constrained optimization problem incorporating TGTV and TGEC, and develop an efficient algorithm based on a preconditioned primal-dual splitting method. Experimental results demonstrate that TSSTF performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods under noise-free conditions and outperforms them under noisy conditions. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive set of recommended parameter values that consistently yield high performance across diverse target regions and noise conditions, aiming to enhance reproducibility and practical utility.

Title: EmoSSLSphere: Multilingual Emotional Speech Synthesis with Spherical Vectors and Discrete Speech Tokens
Authors: Joonyong Park, Kenichi Nakamura
Abstract: This paper introduces EmoSSLSphere, a novel framework for multilingual emotional text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis that combines spherical emotion vectors with discrete token features derived from self-supervised learning (SSL). By encoding emotions in a continuous spherical coordinate space and leveraging SSL-based representations for semantic and acoustic modeling, EmoSSLSphere enables fine-grained emotional control, effective cross-lingual emotion transfer, and robust preservation of speaker identity. We evaluate EmoSSLSphere on English and Japanese corpora, demonstrating significant improvements in speech intelligibility, spectral fidelity, prosodic consistency, and overall synthesis quality. Subjective evaluations further confirm that our method outperforms baseline models in terms of naturalness and emotional expressiveness, underscoring its potential as a scalable solution for multilingual emotional TTS.

Title: Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Enabled Sensing: Cramer-Rao Bound Optimization
Authors: Xiaoqi Zhang, Liang Liu, Shuowen Zhang, Haijun Zhang
Abstract: Recently, beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has emerged as a more flexible solution to engineer the wireless propagation channels, thanks to its non-diagonal reflecting matrix. Although the gain of the BD-RIS over the conventional RIS in communication has been revealed in many works, its gain in 6G sensing is still unknown. This motivates us to study the BD-RIS assisted sensing in this letter. Specifically, we derive the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the angle-of-arrival (AOA) from the target to the BD-RIS under the constraint that the BD-RIS scattering matrix is unitary. To minimize the CRB, we develop an optimization scheme based on an adaptive Riemannian steepest ascent algorithm that can satisfy the non-convex unitary constraint. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed BD-RIS-assisted target localization method achieves superior sensing performance.

Title: Optimizing Rate-CRB Performance for Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Enabled ISAC
Authors: Xiaoqi Zhang, Liang Liu, Shuowen Zhang, Weifeng Zhu, Haijun Zhang
Abstract: This letter considers a beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where the BD-RIS can help a multi-antenna base station (BS) serve multiple user equipments (UEs) and localize a target simultaneously. We formulate an optimization problem that designs the BS beamforming matrix and the BD-RIS scattering matrix to maximize UEs' sum rate subject to a localization Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) constraint and an additional unitary matrix constraint for the scattering matrix. Because unitary matrices form a manifold, our problem belongs to constrained manifold optimization. This letter proposes a log-barrier based Riemannian steepest ascent method to solve this problem effectively. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of our algorithm and the performance gain of the BD-RIS aided ISAC systems over the conventional RIS aided ISAC systems.

Title: MoE-TTS: Enhancing Out-of-Domain Text Understanding for Description-based TTS via Mixture-of-Experts
Authors: Heyang Xue, Xuchen Song, Yu Tang, Jianyu Chen, Yanru Chen, Yang Li, Yahui Zhou
Abstract: Description-based text-to-speech (TTS) models exhibit strong performance on in-domain text descriptions, i.e., those encountered during training. However, in real-world applications, the diverse range of user-generated descriptions inevitably introduces numerous out-of-domain inputs that challenge the text understanding capabilities of these systems. To address this issue, we propose MoE-TTS, a description-based TTS model designed to enhance the understanding of out-of-domain text descriptions. MoE-TTS employs a modality-based mixture-of-experts (MoE) approach to augment a pre-trained textual large language model (LLM) with a set of specialized weights adapted to the speech modality while maintaining the original LLM frozen during training. This approach allows MoE-TTS to effectively leverage the pre-trained knowledge and text understanding abilities of textual LLMs. Our experimental results indicate that: first, even the most advanced closed-source commercial products can be challenged by carefully designed out-of-domain description test sets; second, MoE-TTS achieves superior performance in generating speech that more accurately reflects the descriptions.

Title: Guiding WaveMamba with Frequency Maps for Image Debanding
Authors: Xinyi Wang, Smaranda Tasmoc, Nantheera Anantrasirichai, Angeliki Katsenou
Abstract: Compression at low bitrates in modern codecs often introduces banding artifacts, especially in smooth regions such as skies. These artifacts degrade visual quality and are common in user-generated content due to repeated transcoding. We propose a banding restoration method that employs the Wavelet State Space Model and a frequency masking map to preserve high-frequency details. Furthermore, we provide a benchmark of open-source banding restoration methods and evaluate their performance on two public banding image datasets. Experimentation on the available datasets suggests that the proposed post-processing approach effectively suppresses banding compared to the state-of-the-art method (a DBI value of 0.082 on BAND-2k) while preserving image textures. Visual inspections of the results confirm this. Code and supplementary material are available at: this https URL.

Title: Direct data-driven interpolation and approximation of linear parameter-varying system trajectories
Authors: Chris Verhoek, Ivan Markovsky, Roland T√≥th
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating missing values in trajectories of linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems. We solve this interpolation problem for the class of shifted-affine LPV systems. Conditions for the existence and uniqueness of solutions are given and a direct data-driven algorithm for its computation is presented, i.e., the data-generating system is not given by a parametric model but is implicitly specified by data. We illustrate the applicability of the proposed solution on illustrative examples of a mass-spring-damper system with exogenous and endogenous parameter variation.

Title: Important Bit Prefix M-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation for Semantic Communications
Authors: Haonan Lu, Rui Meng, Xiaodong Xu, Yiming Liu, Ping Zhang, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: M-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (MQAM) is a commonly used channel modulation technology in wireless communication systems. To achieve dedicated channel modulation for semantic communication (SemCom), we propose an Important-Bit-Prefixed MQAM (IBP-MQAM) scheme and derive its approximate expression of important symbol error rate (ISER) and unimportant symbol error rate (USER). By extracting and quantifying text semantics using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), we verify that IBP-MQAM achieves improved performance over MQAM in SemCom scenarios and further analyze the effects of key system parameters.

Title: AnatoMaskGAN: GNN-Driven Slice Feature Fusion and Noise Augmentation for Medical Semantic Image Synthesis
Authors: Zonglin Wu, Yule Xue, Qianxiang Hu, Yaoyao Feng, Yuqi Ma, Shanxiong Chen
Abstract: Medical semantic-mask synthesis boosts data augmentation and analysis, yet most GAN-based approaches still produce one-to-one images and lack spatial consistency in complex scans. To address this, we propose AnatoMaskGAN, a novel synthesis framework that embeds slice-related spatial features to precisely aggregate inter-slice contextual dependencies, introduces diverse image-augmentation strategies, and optimizes deep feature learning to improve performance on complex medical images. Specifically, we design a GNN-based strongly correlated slice-feature fusion module to model spatial relationships between slices and integrate contextual information from neighboring slices, thereby capturing anatomical details more comprehensively; we introduce a three-dimensional spatial noise-injection strategy that weights and fuses spatial features with noise to enhance modeling of structural diversity; and we incorporate a grayscale-texture classifier to optimize grayscale distribution and texture representation during generation. Extensive experiments on the public L2R-OASIS and L2R-Abdomen CT datasets show that AnatoMaskGAN raises PSNR on L2R-OASIS to 26.50 dB (0.43 dB higher than the current state of the art) and achieves an SSIM of 0.8602 on L2R-Abdomen CT--a 0.48 percentage-point gain over the best model, demonstrating its superiority in reconstruction accuracy and perceptual quality. Ablation studies that successively remove the slice-feature fusion module, spatial 3D noise-injection strategy, and grayscale-texture classifier reveal that each component contributes significantly to PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, further confirming the independent value of each core design in enhancing reconstruction accuracy and perceptual quality.

Title: System Synchronization Based on Complex Frequency
Authors: Yusen Wei, Lan Tang
Abstract: In response to the inertia decline caused by high penetration of renewable generation, traditional synchronization criteria that rely solely on frequency consistency are increasingly inadequate for characterizing the coupled behavior of frequency and voltage dynamics during power-system transients. This paper focuses on the theory of complex-frequency synchronization and develops a theory-simulation analysis framework that offers a new perspective for steady-state and transient analysis of low-inertia power systems. First, the fundamental concepts and theoretical foundations of complex-frequency synchronization are presented in detail. Second, local and global dynamic synchronization criteria are derived and the concept of generalized inertia is introduced, which unifies the conventional inertial support to frequency with the inertia-like support of voltage, thereby providing an accurate measure of region-level coupled support strength for voltage and frequency. Finally, numerical case studies on the IEEE 9-bus system validate the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical methods and criteria, and demonstrate a visualization workflow for key indicators such as disturbance impact zones and generalized-inertia regions.

Title: LKFMixer: Exploring Large Kernel Feature For Efficient Image Super-Resolution
Authors: Yinggan Tang, Quanwei Hu
Abstract: The success of self-attention (SA) in Transformer demonstrates the importance of non-local information to image super-resolution (SR), but the huge computing power required makes it difficult to implement lightweight models. To solve this problem, we propose a pure convolutional neural network (CNN) model, LKFMixer, which utilizes large convolutional kernel to simulate the ability of self-attention to capture non-local features. Specifically, we increase the kernel size to 31 to obtain the larger receptive field as possible, and reduce the parameters and computations by coordinate decomposition. Meanwhile, a spatial feature modulation block (SFMB) is designed to enhance the focus of feature information on both spatial and channel dimension. In addition, by introducing feature selection block (FSB), the model can adaptively adjust the weights between local features and non-local features.

Abstract: As neurostimulation devices increasingly incorporate closed-loop functionality, the greater design complexity brings additional requirements for risk management and special considerations to optimise benefit. This manuscript creates a common framework upon which all current and planned neuromodulation-based physiological closed-loop controllers (PCLCs) can be mapped including integration of the Technical Considerations of Medical Devices with Physiologic Closed-Loop Control Technology guidance published in 2023 by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a classification of feedback (reactive) and feedforward (predictive) biomarkers, and control systems theory. We explain risk management in the context of this framework and illustrate its applications for three exemplary technologies. This manuscript serves as guidance to the emerging field of PCLCs in neuromodulation, mitigating risk through standardized nomenclature and a systematic outline for rigorous device development, testing, and implementation.

Title: Subcortical Masks Generation in CT Images via Ensemble-Based Cross-Domain Label Transfer
Authors: Augustine X. W. Lee, Pak-Hei Yeung, Jagath C. Rajapakse
Abstract: Subcortical segmentation in neuroimages plays an important role in understanding brain anatomy and facilitating computer-aided diagnosis of traumatic brain injuries and neurodegenerative disorders. However, training accurate automatic models requires large amounts of labelled data. Despite the availability of publicly available subcortical segmentation datasets for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), a significant gap exists for Computed Tomography (CT). This paper proposes an automatic ensemble framework to generate high-quality subcortical segmentation labels for CT scans by leveraging existing MRI-based models. We introduce a robust ensembling pipeline to integrate them and apply it to unannotated paired MRI-CT data, resulting in a comprehensive CT subcortical segmentation dataset. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework. Furthermore, using our generated CT dataset, we train segmentation models that achieve improved performance on related segmentation tasks. To facilitate future research, we make our source code, generated dataset, and trained models publicly available at this https URL, marking the first open-source release for CT subcortical segmentation to the best of our knowledge.

Title: Importance-Aware Robust Semantic Transmission for LEO Satellite-Ground Communication
Authors: Hui Cao, Rui Meng, Xiaodong Xu, Shujun Han, Ping Zhang
Abstract: Satellite-ground semantic communication is anticipated to serve a critical role in the forthcoming 6G era. Nonetheless, task-oriented data transmission in such systems remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the dynamic nature of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) fluctuations and the stringent bandwidth limitations inherent to low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite channels. In response to these constraints, we propose an importance-aware robust semantic transmission (IRST) framework, specifically designed for scenarios characterized by bandwidth scarcity and channel variability. The IRST scheme begins by applying a segmentation model enhancement algorithm to improve the granularity and accuracy of semantic segmentation. Subsequently, a task-driven semantic selection method is employed to prioritize the transmission of semantically vital content based on real-time channel state information. Furthermore, the framework incorporates a stack-based, SNR-aware channel codec capable of executing adaptive channel coding in alignment with SNR variations. Comparative evaluations across diverse operating conditions demonstrate the superior performance and resilience of the IRST model relative to existing benchmarks.

Title: Efficient Artifacts Removal for Adaptive Deep Brain Stimulation and a Temporal Event Localization Analysis
Authors: Tzu-Chi Liu, Po-Lin Chen, Yi-Chieh Chen, Po-Hsun Tu, Chih-Hua Yeh, Mun-Chun Yeap, Chiung-Chu Chen, Hau-Tieng Wu
Abstract: Adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) leverages symptom-related biomarkers to deliver personalized neuromodulation therapy, with the potential to improve treatment efficacy and reduce power consumption compared to conventional DBS. However, stimulation-induced signal contamination remains a major technical barrier to advancing its clinical application. Existing artifact removal strategies, both front-end and back-end, face trade-offs between artifact suppression and algorithmic flexibility. Among back-end algorithms, Shrinkage and Manifold-based Artifact Removal using Template Adaptation (SMARTA) has shown promising performance in mitigating stimulus artifacts with minimal distortion to local field potentials (LFPs), but its high computational demand and inability to handle transient direct current (DC) artifacts limit its use in real-time applications. To address this, we developed SMARTA+, a computationally efficient extension of SMARTA capable of suppressing both stimulus and transient DC artifacts while supporting flexible algorithmic design. We evaluated SMARTA+ using semi-real aDBS data and real data from Parkinson's disease patients. Compared to SMARTA and other established methods, SMARTA+ achieved comparable or superior artifact removal while significantly reducing computation time. It preserved spectral and temporal structures, ranging from beta band to high-frequency oscillations, and demonstrated robustness across diverse stimulation protocols. Temporal event localization analysis further showed improved accuracy in detecting beta bursts. These findings support SMARTA+ as a promising tool for advancing real-time, closed-loop aDBS systems.

Title: Reducing AoI and Improving Throughput for NOMA-assisted SGF Systems: A Hierarchical Learning Approach
Authors: Yuqin Liu, Mona Jaber, Yan Liu, Arumugam Nallanathan
Abstract: A non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) assisted semi-grant-free (SGF) framework is proposed to enable channel access for grant-free users (GFUs) by using residual resources from grant-based users. Under this framework, the problem of joint beamforming design and transmission scheduling is formulated to improve the system throughput and reduce the age-of-information of GFUs. The aforementioned problem is transferred into a Markov Decision Process to model the changing environment with the transmission/ waiting/ retransmission of GFUs. In an effort to solve the pertinent problem, firstly, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based transmission scheduling approach is proposed for determining the optimal transmission probability based on the available transmission slots and transmission status of GFUs. Secondly, a hierarchical learning algorithm is proposed to analyze the channel state information of GBUs and the transmission status of GFUs, and to train an upper-level policy based on this analysis for beamforming to achieve efficient grant-based transmission, while a lower-level policy adapts to maximize the utilization of transmission slots allocated by the upper-level agent. The two policies interact to improve channel access and avoid collisions. Numerical results reveal that 1) The DRL based transmission scheduling outperforms existing adaptive and state-dependent baselines in AoI reduction, where an average three-time-slots-earlier-transmission can be obtained compared to the state-dependent choice, and five time slots earlier can be achieved when comparing to the adaptive choice; 2) The hierarchical learning algorithm is able to achieve approximately a 31.82% gain while maintaining the average AoI of GFUs within 1.5 time slots. 3) The effectiveness of the hierarchical learning scheme in NOMA-assisted SGF system is validated across scenarios with GFUs counts from 1-5 times of GBUs.

Title: Liquid Crystal-Based RIS Loss-Trade-Off Analysis
Authors: Bowu Wang, Mohamadreza Delbari, Robin Neuder, Alejandro Jim√©nez-S√°ez, Vahid Jamali
Abstract: Liquid crystal (LC) technology has emerged as a promising solution for large reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) at millimeter wave (mmWave) bands, offering advantages such as low power consumption, scalability, and continuously tunable phase shifts. For LC-RIS based on the delay-line architecture, i.e., with dedicated phase shifters, there exists a trade-off between the maximum achievable phase-shift range and the corresponding insertion loss, which has not been studied for LC-RIS-assisted wireless systems yet. In this paper, we investigate this trade-off where a base station (BS) and an RIS are configured to minimize the transmit power while satisfying a given quality of service (QoS) for a number of users. Simulation results reveal a fundamental trade-off between the total transmit power and the achievable data rate as a function of the LC phase-shift range.

Title: Semi-Supervised Learning with Online Knowledge Distillation for Skin Lesion Classification
Authors: Siyamalan Manivannan
Abstract: Deep Learning has emerged as a promising approach for skin lesion analysis. However, existing methods mostly rely on fully supervised learning, requiring extensive labeled data, which is challenging and costly to obtain. To alleviate this annotation burden, this study introduces a novel semi-supervised deep learning approach that integrates ensemble learning with online knowledge distillation for enhanced skin lesion classification. Our methodology involves training an ensemble of convolutional neural network models, using online knowledge distillation to transfer insights from the ensemble to its members. This process aims to enhance the performance of each model within the ensemble, thereby elevating the overall performance of the ensemble itself. Post-training, any individual model within the ensemble can be deployed at test time, as each member is trained to deliver comparable performance to the ensemble. This is particularly beneficial in resource-constrained environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the knowledge-distilled individual model performs better than independently trained models. Our approach demonstrates superior performance on both the \emph{International Skin Imaging Collaboration} 2018 and 2019 public benchmark datasets, surpassing current state-of-the-art results. By leveraging ensemble learning and online knowledge distillation, our method reduces the need for extensive labeled data while providing a more resource-efficient solution for skin lesion classification in real-world scenarios.

Title: Integrating Uncertainties for Koopman-Based Stabilization
Authors: Yicheng Lin, Bingxian Wu, Nan Bai, Zhiyong Sun, Yunxiao Ren, Chuanze Chen, Zhisheng Duan
Abstract: Over the past decades, the Koopman operator has been widely applied in data-driven control, yet its theoretical foundations remain underexplored. This paper establishes a unified framework to address the robust stabilization problem in data-driven control via the Koopman operator, fully accounting for three uncertainties: projection error, estimation error, and process disturbance. It comprehensively investigates both direct and indirect data-driven control approaches, facilitating flexible methodology selection for analysis and control. For the direct approach, considering process disturbances, the lifted-state feedback controller, designed via a linear matrix inequality (LMI), robustly stabilizes all lifted bilinear systems consistent with noisy data. For the indirect approach requiring system identification, the feedback controller, designed using a nonlinear matrix inequality convertible to an LMI, ensures closed-loop stability under worst-case process disturbances. Numerical simulations via cross-validation validate the effectiveness of both approaches, highlighting their theoretical significance and practical utility.

Title: Enhancing In-the-Wild Speech Emotion Conversion with Resynthesis-based Duration Modeling
Authors: Navin Raj Prabhu, Danilo de Oliveira, Nale Lehmann-Willenbrock, Timo Gerkmann
Abstract: Speech Emotion Conversion aims to modify the emotion expressed in input speech while preserving lexical content and speaker identity. Recently, generative modeling approaches have shown promising results in changing local acoustic properties such as fundamental frequency, spectral envelope and energy, but often lack the ability to control the duration of sounds. To address this, we propose a duration modeling framework using resynthesis-based discrete content representations, enabling modification of speech duration to reflect target emotions and achieve controllable speech rates without using parallel data. Experimental results reveal that the inclusion of the proposed duration modeling framework significantly enhances emotional expressiveness, in the in-the-wild MSP-Podcast dataset. Analyses show that low-arousal emotions correlate with longer durations and slower speech rates, while high-arousal emotions produce shorter, faster speech.

Title: Identification of Sub/Super-Synchronous Control Interaction Paths Using Dissipative Energy Flow
Authors: Kaustav Chatterjee, Sameer Nekkalapu, Sayak Mukherjee, Ramij Raja Hossain, Marcelo Elizondo
Abstract: Sub- and super-synchronous control interactions (SSCIs) are oscillations arising from adverse interactions between inverter-based resource (IBR) controls and the power network. SSCIs often involve multiple frequencies and propagate through complex, interconnected paths, making it difficult for model-based approaches to identify both the sources and the paths of oscillatory energy flow. This paper extends the Dissipative Energy Flow (DEF) method, originally developed for low-frequency electromechanical oscillations, to identify SSCI sources and dynamic interaction paths across multiple frequencies using three-phase voltage and current measurements. The approach operates in the dq frame using dynamic phasors, enabling mode-specific DEF computation from bandpass-filtered signals. An electromagnetic transient (EMT) case study on a meshed network with synchronous generator and type-3 wind farm resources under series-compensated conditions demonstrates the method's capability to distinguish frequency-dependent source and sink roles, including cases where the same resource acts as a source at one frequency and a sink at another. The results show DEF can provide a physics-based and automation-friendly tool for SSCI diagnosis in IBR-rich grids.

Title: Emphasis Sensitivity in Speech Representations
Authors: Shaun Cassini, Thomas Hain, Anton Ragni
Abstract: This work investigates whether modern speech models are sensitive to prosodic emphasis - whether they encode emphasized and neutral words in systematically different ways. Prior work typically relies on isolated acoustic correlates (e.g., pitch, duration) or label prediction, both of which miss the relational structure of emphasis. This paper proposes a residual-based framework, defining emphasis as the difference between paired neutral and emphasized word representations. Analysis on self-supervised speech models shows that these residuals correlate strongly with duration changes and perform poorly at word identity prediction, indicating a structured, relational encoding of prosodic emphasis. In ASR fine-tuned models, residuals occupy a subspace up to 50% more compact than in pre-trained models, further suggesting that emphasis is encoded as a consistent, low-dimensional transformation that becomes more structured with task-specific learning.

Title: Two-Impulse Trajectory Design in Two-Body Systems With Riemannian Geometry
Authors: Samuel G. Gessow, James Tseng, Eden Zafran, Brett T. Lopez
Abstract: This work presents a new method for generating impulsive trajectories in restricted two-body systems by leveraging Riemannian geometry. The proposed method transforms the standard trajectory optimization problem into a purely geometric one that involves computing a set of geodesics for a suitable Riemannian metric. This transformation is achieved by defining a metric, specifically the Jacobi metric, that embeds the dynamics directly into the metric, so any geodesic of the metric is also a dynamically feasible trajectory. The method finds the fuel-optimal transfer trajectory by sampling candidate energy ($\Delta V$) changes for different points on the current and desired orbit, and efficiently computing and evaluating each candidate geodesic, which are equivalent to candidate orbit transfer trajectories via the Jacobi metric. The method bypasses the known issues of optimization-based methods, e.g., sensitivity to the initial guess, and can be applied to more complex two-body systems. The approach is demonstrated on the minimum-$\Delta V$ two-impulse phase-free orbit transfer problem, first on a Keplerian system and second on a system with a modeled $J_2$ perturbation. The proposed method is shown to meet or exceed the state-of-the-art methods in the minimum-$\Delta V$ problem in the Keplerian system. The generality and versatility of the approach is demonstrated by seamlessly including the $J_2$ perturbation, a case that many existing methods cannot handle. Numerical simulations and performance comparisons showcase the effectiveness of the approach.

Title: Relative Pose Regression with Pose Auto-Encoders: Enhancing Accuracy and Data Efficiency for Retail Applications
Authors: Yoli Shavit, Yosi Keller
Abstract: Accurate camera localization is crucial for modern retail environments, enabling enhanced customer experiences, streamlined inventory management, and autonomous operations. While Absolute Pose Regression (APR) from a single image offers a promising solution, approaches that incorporate visual and spatial scene priors tend to achieve higher accuracy. Camera Pose Auto-Encoders (PAEs) have recently been introduced to embed such priors into APR. In this work, we extend PAEs to the task of Relative Pose Regression (RPR) and propose a novel re-localization scheme that refines APR predictions using PAE-based RPR, without requiring additional storage of images or pose data. We first introduce PAE-based RPR and establish its effectiveness by comparing it with image-based RPR models of equivalent architectures. We then demonstrate that our refinement strategy, driven by a PAE-based RPR, enhances APR localization accuracy on indoor benchmarks. Notably, our method is shown to achieve competitive performance even when trained with only 30% of the data, substantially reducing the data collection burden for retail deployment. Our code and pre-trained models are available at: this https URL

Title: ViPE: Video Pose Engine for 3D Geometric Perception

Abstract: Accurate 3D geometric perception is an important prerequisite for a wide range of spatial AI systems. While state-of-the-art methods depend on large-scale training data, acquiring consistent and precise 3D annotations from in-the-wild videos remains a key challenge. In this work, we introduce ViPE, a handy and versatile video processing engine designed to bridge this gap. ViPE efficiently estimates camera intrinsics, camera motion, and dense, near-metric depth maps from unconstrained raw videos. It is robust to diverse scenarios, including dynamic selfie videos, cinematic shots, or dashcams, and supports various camera models such as pinhole, wide-angle, and 360¬∞ panoramas. We have benchmarked ViPE on multiple benchmarks. Notably, it outperforms existing uncalibrated pose estimation baselines by 18%/50% on TUM/KITTI sequences, and runs at 3-5FPS on a single GPU for standard input resolutions. We use ViPE to annotate a large-scale collection of videos. This collection includes around 100K real-world internet videos, 1M high-quality AI-generated videos, and 2K panoramic videos, totaling approximately 96M frames -- all annotated with accurate camera poses and dense depth maps. We open-source ViPE and the annotated dataset with the hope of accelerating the development of spatial AI systems.

Title: IPG: Incremental Patch Generation for Generalized Adversarial Patch Training
Authors: Wonho Lee, Hyunsik Na, Jisu Lee, Daeseon Choi
Abstract: The advent of adversarial patches poses a significant challenge to the robustness of AI models, particularly in the domain of computer vision tasks such as object detection. In contradistinction to traditional adversarial examples, these patches target specific regions of an image, resulting in the malfunction of AI models. This paper proposes Incremental Patch Generation (IPG), a method that generates adversarial patches up to 11.1 times more efficiently than existing approaches while maintaining comparable attack performance. The efficacy of IPG is demonstrated by experiments and ablation studies including YOLO's feature distribution visualization and adversarial training results, which show that it produces well-generalized patches that effectively cover a broader range of model vulnerabilities. Furthermore, IPG-generated datasets can serve as a robust knowledge foundation for constructing a robust model, enabling structured representation, advanced reasoning, and proactive defenses in AI security ecosystems. The findings of this study suggest that IPG has considerable potential for future utilization not only in adversarial patch defense but also in real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles, security systems, and medical imaging, where AI models must remain resilient to adversarial attacks in dynamic and high-stakes environments.

Title: Perturbed Public Voices (P$^{2}$V): A Dataset for Robust Audio Deepfake Detection
Authors: Chongyang Gao, Marco Postiglione, Isabel Gortner, Sarit Kraus, V.S. Subrahmanian
Abstract: Current audio deepfake detectors cannot be trusted. While they excel on controlled benchmarks, they fail when tested in the real world. We introduce Perturbed Public Voices (P$^{2}$V), an IRB-approved dataset capturing three critical aspects of malicious deepfakes: (1) identity-consistent transcripts via LLMs, (2) environmental and adversarial noise, and (3) state-of-the-art voice cloning (2020-2025). Experiments reveal alarming vulnerabilities of 22 recent audio deepfake detectors: models trained on current datasets lose 43% performance when tested on P$^{2}$V, with performance measured as the mean of F1 score on deepfake audio, AUC, and 1-EER. Simple adversarial perturbations induce up to 16% performance degradation, while advanced cloning techniques reduce detectability by 20-30%. In contrast, P$^{2}$V-trained models maintain robustness against these attacks while generalizing to existing datasets, establishing a new benchmark for robust audio deepfake detection. P$^{2}$V will be publicly released upon acceptance by a conference/journal.

Title: Robust Online Calibration for UWB-Aided Visual-Inertial Navigation with Bias Correction
Authors: Yizhi Zhou, Jie Xu, Jiawei Xia, Zechen Hu, Weizi Li, Xuan Wang
Abstract: This paper presents a novel robust online calibration framework for Ultra-Wideband (UWB) anchors in UWB-aided Visual-Inertial Navigation Systems (VINS). Accurate anchor positioning, a process known as calibration, is crucial for integrating UWB ranging measurements into state estimation. While several prior works have demonstrated satisfactory results by using robot-aided systems to autonomously calibrate UWB systems, there are still some limitations: 1) these approaches assume accurate robot localization during the initialization step, ignoring localization errors that can compromise calibration robustness, and 2) the calibration results are highly sensitive to the initial guess of the UWB anchors' positions, reducing the practical applicability of these methods in real-world scenarios. Our approach addresses these challenges by explicitly incorporating the impact of robot localization uncertainties into the calibration process, ensuring robust initialization. To further enhance the robustness of the calibration results against initialization errors, we propose a tightly-coupled Schmidt Kalman Filter (SKF)-based online refinement method, making the system suitable for practical applications. Simulations and real-world experiments validate the improved accuracy and robustness of our approach.

Title: Zono-Conformal Prediction: Zonotope-Based Uncertainty Quantification for Regression and Classification Tasks
Authors: Laura L√ºtzow, Michael Eichelbeck, Mykel J. Kochenderfer, Matthias Althoff
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a popular uncertainty quantification method that augments a base predictor with prediction sets with statistically valid coverage guarantees. However, current methods are often computationally expensive and data-intensive, as they require constructing an uncertainty model before calibration. Moreover, existing approaches typically represent the prediction sets with intervals, which limits their ability to capture dependencies in multi-dimensional outputs. We address these limitations by introducing zono-conformal prediction, a novel approach inspired by interval predictor models and reachset-conformant identification that constructs prediction zonotopes with assured coverage. By placing zonotopic uncertainty sets directly into the model of the base predictor, zono-conformal predictors can be identified via a single, data-efficient linear program. While we can apply zono-conformal prediction to arbitrary nonlinear base predictors, we focus on feed-forward neural networks in this work. Aside from regression tasks, we also construct optimal zono-conformal predictors in classification settings where the output of an uncertain predictor is a set of possible classes. We provide probabilistic coverage guarantees and present methods for detecting outliers in the identification data. In extensive numerical experiments, we show that zono-conformal predictors are less conservative than interval predictor models and standard conformal prediction methods, while achieving a similar coverage over the test data.

Title: LD-LAudio-V1: Video-to-Long-Form-Audio Generation Extension with Dual Lightweight Adapters
Authors: Haomin Zhang, Kristin Qi, Shuxin Yang, Zihao Chen, Chaofan Ding, Xinhan Di
Abstract: Generating high-quality and temporally synchronized audio from video content is essential for video editing and post-production tasks, enabling the creation of semantically aligned audio for silent videos. However, most existing approaches focus on short-form audio generation for video segments under 10 seconds or rely on noisy datasets for long-form video-to-audio zsynthesis. To address these limitations, we introduce LD-LAudio-V1, an extension of state-of-the-art video-to-audio models and it incorporates dual lightweight adapters to enable long-form audio generation. In addition, we release a clean and human-annotated video-to-audio dataset that contains pure sound effects without noise or artifacts. Our method significantly reduces splicing artifacts and temporal inconsistencies while maintaining computational efficiency. Compared to direct fine-tuning with short training videos, LD-LAudio-V1 achieves significant improvements across multiple metrics: $FD_{\text{passt}}$ 450.00 $\rightarrow$ 327.29 (+27.27%), $FD_{\text{panns}}$ 34.88 $\rightarrow$ 22.68 (+34.98%), $FD_{\text{vgg}}$ 3.75 $\rightarrow$ 1.28 (+65.87%), $KL_{\text{panns}}$ 2.49 $\rightarrow$ 2.07 (+16.87%), $KL_{\text{passt}}$ 1.78 $\rightarrow$ 1.53 (+14.04%), $IS_{\text{panns}}$ 4.17 $\rightarrow$ 4.30 (+3.12%), $IB_{\text{score}}$ 0.25 $\rightarrow$ 0.28 (+12.00%), $Energy\Delta10\text{ms}$ 0.3013 $\rightarrow$ 0.1349 (+55.23%), $Energy\Delta10\text{ms(this http URL)}$ 0.0531 $\rightarrow$ 0.0288 (+45.76%), and $Sem.\,Rel.$ 2.73 $\rightarrow$ 3.28 (+20.15%).

Title: Full-Wave Modeling of Transcranial Ultrasound using Volume-Surface Integral Equations and CT-Derived Heterogeneous Skull Data
Authors: Alberto Almuna-Morales, Danilo Aballay, Pierre G√©lat, Reza Haqshenas, Elwin van 't Wout
Abstract: Transcranial ultrasound therapy uses focused acoustic energy to induce therapeutic bioeffects in the brain. Ultrasound is transmitted through the skull, which is highly attenuating and heterogeneous, causing beam distortion, reducing focal pressure, and shifting the target location. Computational models are frequently used for predicting beam aberration, assessing cranial heating, and correcting the phase of ultrasound transducers. These models often rely on computed tomography (CT) images to build patient-specific geometries and estimate skull acoustic properties. However, the coarse voxel resolution of CT limits accuracy for differential equation solvers. This paper presents an efficient numerical method based on volume-surface integral equations to model full-wave acoustic propagation through heterogeneous skull tissue. We have shown that this approach is highly accurate on relatively coarse meshes compared to the minimum wavelength, enabling direct use of CT voxel data. The method is validated against a high-resolution boundary element model using an averaged skull representation. Simulations with a CT-based skull model and a bowl transducer show significant beam distortion and attenuation, with a focal shift of several millimeters from the homogeneous case.

Authors: Haotang Li, Zhenyu Qi, Sen He, Kebin Peng, Sheng Tan, Yili Ren, Tomas Cerny, Jiyue Zhao, Zi Wang
Abstract: Improper sitting posture during prolonged computer use has become a significant public health concern. Traditional posture monitoring solutions face substantial barriers, including privacy concerns with camera-based systems and user discomfort with wearable sensors. This paper presents UWB-PostureGuard, a privacy-preserving ultra-wideband (UWB) sensing system that advances mobile technologies for preventive health management through continuous, contactless monitoring of ergonomic sitting posture. Our system leverages commercial UWB devices, utilizing comprehensive feature engineering to extract multiple ergonomic sitting posture features. We develop PoseGBDT to effectively capture temporal dependencies in posture patterns, addressing limitations of traditional frame-wise classification approaches. Extensive real-world evaluation across 10 participants and 19 distinct postures demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving 99.11% accuracy while maintaining robustness against environmental variables such as clothing thickness, additional devices, and furniture configurations. Our system provides a scalable, privacy-preserving mobile health solution on existing platforms for proactive ergonomic management, improving quality of life at low costs.

Title: Geometry-Aware Predictive Safety Filters on Humanoids: From Poisson Safety Functions to CBF Constrained MPC
Authors: Ryan M. Bena, Gilbert Bahati, Blake Werner, Ryan K. Cosner, Lizhi Yang, Aaron D. Ames
Abstract: Autonomous navigation through unstructured and dynamically-changing environments is a complex task that continues to present many challenges for modern roboticists. In particular, legged robots typically possess manipulable asymmetric geometries which must be considered during safety-critical trajectory planning. This work proposes a predictive safety filter: a nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for online trajectory generation with geometry-aware safety constraints based on control barrier functions (CBFs). Critically, our method leverages Poisson safety functions to numerically synthesize CBF constraints directly from perception data. We extend the theoretical framework for Poisson safety functions to incorporate temporal changes in the domain by reformulating the static Dirichlet problem for Poisson's equation as a parameterized moving boundary value problem. Furthermore, we employ Minkowski set operations to lift the domain into a configuration space that accounts for robot geometry. Finally, we implement our real-time predictive safety filter on humanoid and quadruped robots in various safety-critical scenarios. The results highlight the versatility of Poisson safety functions, as well as the benefit of CBF constrained model predictive safety-critical controllers.

Title: The Role of Entanglement in Quantum Reservoir Computing with Coupled Kerr Nonlinear Oscillators
Authors: Ali Karimi, Hadi Zadeh-Haghighi, Youssef Kora, Christoph Simon
Abstract: Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) uses quantum dynamics to efficiently process temporal data. In this work, we investigate a QRC framework based on two coupled Kerr nonlinear oscillators, a system well-suited for time-series prediction tasks due to its complex nonlinear interactions and potentially high-dimensional state space. We explore how its performance in time-series prediction depends on key physical parameters: input drive strength, Kerr nonlinearity, and oscillator coupling, and analyze the role of entanglement in improving the reservoir's computational performance, focusing on its effect on predicting non-trivial time series. Using logarithmic negativity to quantify entanglement and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) to evaluate predictive accuracy, our results suggest that entanglement provides a computational advantage on average-up to a threshold in the input frequency-that persists under some levels of dissipation and dephasing. In particular, we find that higher dissipation rates can enhance performance. While the entanglement advantage manifests as improvements in both average and worst-case performance, it does not lead to improvements in the best-case error. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of quantum reservoirs for high performance, efficient quantum machine learning and time-series forecasting.

Title: Novel Parasitic Dual-Scale Modeling for Efficient and Accurate Multilingual Speech Translation
Authors: Chenyang Le, Yinfeng Xia, Huiyan Li, Manhong Wang, Yutao Sun, Xingyang Ma, Yanmin Qian
Abstract: Recent advancements in speech-to-text translation have led to the development of multilingual models capable of handling multiple language pairs simultaneously. However, these unified models often suffer from large parameter sizes, making it challenging to balance inference efficiency and performance, particularly in local deployment scenarios. We propose an innovative Parasitic Dual-Scale Approach, which combines an enhanced speculative sampling method with model compression and knowledge distillation techniques. Building on the Whisper Medium model, we enhance it for multilingual speech translation into whisperM2M, and integrate our novel KVSPN module, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across six popular languages with improved inference efficiency. KVSPN enables a 40\% speedup with no BLEU score degradation. Combined with distillation methods, it represents a 2.6$\times$ speedup over the original Whisper Medium with superior performance.

Title: Benchmarking Prosody Encoding in Discrete Speech Tokens
Authors: Kentaro Onda, Satoru Fukayama, Daisuke Saito, Nobuaki Minematsu
Abstract: Recently, discrete tokens derived from self-supervised learning (SSL) models via k-means clustering have been actively studied as pseudo-text in speech language models and as efficient intermediate representations for various tasks. However, these discrete tokens are typically learned in advance, separately from the training of language models or downstream tasks. As a result, choices related to discretization, such as the SSL model used or the number of clusters, must be made heuristically. In particular, speech language models are expected to understand and generate responses that reflect not only the semantic content but also prosodic features. Yet, there has been limited research on the ability of discrete tokens to capture prosodic information. To address this gap, this study conducts a comprehensive analysis focusing on prosodic encoding based on their sensitivity to the artificially modified prosody, aiming to provide practical guidelines for designing discrete tokens.

Title: Repetitive TMS-based Identification of Methamphetamine-Dependent Individuals Using EEG Spectra
Authors: Ziyi Zeng, Yun-Hsuan Chen, Xurong Gao, Wenyao Zheng, Hemmings Wu, Zhoule Zhu, Jie Yang, Chengkai Wang, Lihua Zhong, Weiwei Cheng, Mohamad Sawan
Abstract: The impact of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on methamphetamine (METH) users' craving levels is often assessed using questionnaires. This study explores the feasibility of using neural signals to obtain more objective results. EEG signals recorded from 20 METH-addicted participants Before and After rTMS (MBT and MAT) and from 20 healthy participants (HC) are analyzed. In each EEG paradigm, participants are shown 15 METH-related and 15 neutral pictures randomly, and the relative band power (RBP) of each EEG sub-band frequency is derived. The average RBP across all 31 channels, as well as individual brain regions, is analyzed. Statistically, MAT's alpha, beta, and gamma RBPs are more like those of HC compared to MBT, as indicated by the power topographies. Utilizing a random forest (RF), the gamma RBP is identified as the optimal frequency band for distinguishing between MBT and HC with a 90% accuracy. The performance of classifying MAT versus HC is lower than that of MBT versus HC, suggesting that the efficacy of rTMS can be validated using RF with gamma RBP. Furthermore, the gamma RBP recorded by the TP10 and CP2 channels dominates the classification task of MBT versus HC when receiving METH-related image cues. The gamma RBP during exposure to METH-related cues can serve as a biomarker for distinguishing between MBT and HC and for evaluating the effectiveness of rTMS. Therefore, real-time monitoring of gamma RBP variations holds promise as a parameter for implementing a customized closed-loop neuromodulation system for treating METH addiction.

Title: Mitigating Category Imbalance: Fosafer System for the Multimodal Emotion and Intent Joint Understanding Challenge
Authors: Honghong Wang, Yankai Wang, Dejun Zhang, Jing Deng, Rong Zheng
Abstract: This paper presents Fosafer approach to the Track 2 Mandarin in the Multimodal Emotion and Intent Joint Understandingchallenge, which focuses on achieving joint recognition of emotion and intent in Mandarin, despite the issue of category imbalance. To alleviate this issue, we use a variety of data augmentation techniques across text, video, and audio modalities. Additionally, we introduce the SampleWeighted Focal Contrastive loss, designed to address the challenges of recognizing minority class samples and those that are semantically similar but difficult to distinguish. Moreover, we fine-tune the Hubert model to adapt the emotion and intent joint recognition. To mitigate modal competition, we introduce a modal dropout strategy. For the final predictions, a plurality voting approach is used to determine the results. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which achieves the second-best performance in the Track 2 Mandarin challenge.

Title: Speech Emotion Recognition Using Fine-Tuned DWFormer:A Study on Track 1 of the IERPChallenge 2024
Authors: Honghong Wang, Xupeng Jia, Jing Deng, Rong Zheng
Abstract: The field of artificial intelligence has a strong interest in the topic of emotion recognition. The majority of extant emotion recognition models are oriented towards enhancing the precision of discrete emotion label prediction. Given the direct relationship between human personality and emotion, as well as the significant inter-individual differences in subjective emotional expression, the IERP Challenge 2024 incorporates personality traits into emotion recognition research. This paper presents the Fosafer submissions to the Track 1 of the IERP Challenge 2024. This task primarily concerns the recognition of emotions in audio, while also providing text and audio features. In Track 1, we utilized exclusively audio-based features and fine-tuned a pre-trained speech emotion recognition model, DWFormer, through the integration of data augmentation and score fusion strategies, thereby achieving the first place among the participating teams.

Title: Robust Convolution Neural ODEs via Contractivity-promoting regularization
Authors: Muhammad Zakwan, Liang Xu, Giancarlo Ferrari-Trecate
Abstract: Neural networks can be fragile to input noise and adversarial attacks. In this work, we consider Convolutional Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs), a family of continuous-depth neural networks represented by dynamical systems, and propose to use contraction theory to improve their robustness. For a contractive dynamical system two trajectories starting from different initial conditions converge to each other exponentially fast. Contractive Convolutional NODEs can enjoy increased robustness as slight perturbations of the features do not cause a significant change in the output. Contractivity can be induced during training by using a regularization term involving the Jacobian of the system dynamics. To reduce the computational burden, we show that it can also be promoted using carefully selected weight regularization terms for a class of NODEs with slope-restricted activation functions. The performance of the proposed regularizers is illustrated through benchmark image classification tasks on MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets, where images are corrupted by different kinds of noise and attacks.

Title: A Comparative Study of Floating-Base Space Parameterizations for Agile Whole-Body Motion Planning
Authors: Evangelos Tsiatsianas, Chairi Kiourt, Konstantinos Chatzilygeroudis
Abstract: Automatically generating agile whole-body motions for legged and humanoid robots remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. While numerous trajectory optimization approaches have been proposed, there is no clear guideline on how the choice of floating-base space parameterization affects performance, especially for agile behaviors involving complex contact dynamics. In this paper, we present a comparative study of different parameterizations for direct transcription-based trajectory optimization of agile motions in legged systems. We systematically evaluate several common choices under identical optimization settings to ensure a fair comparison. Furthermore, we introduce a novel formulation based on the tangent space of SE(3) for representing the robot's floating-base pose, which, to our knowledge, has not received attention from the literature. This approach enables the use of mature off-the-shelf numerical solvers without requiring specialized manifold optimization techniques. We hope that our experiments and analysis will provide meaningful insights for selecting the appropriate floating-based representation for agile whole-body motion generation.

Title: Towards Fully Onboard State Estimation and Trajectory Tracking for UAVs with Suspended Payloads
Authors: Martin Jirou≈°ek, Tom√°≈° B√°ƒça, Martin Saska
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of tracking the position of a cable-suspended payload carried by an unmanned aerial vehicle, with a focus on real-world deployment and minimal hardware requirements. In contrast to many existing approaches that rely on motion-capture systems, additional onboard cameras, or instrumented payloads, we propose a framework that uses only standard onboard sensors--specifically, real-time kinematic global navigation satellite system measurements and data from the onboard inertial measurement unit--to estimate and control the payload's position. The system models the full coupled dynamics of the aerial vehicle and payload, and integrates a linear Kalman filter for state estimation, a model predictive contouring control planner, and an incremental model predictive controller. The control architecture is designed to remain effective despite sensing limitations and estimation uncertainty. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed system achieves performance comparable to control based on ground-truth measurements, with only minor degradation (< 6%). The system also shows strong robustness to variations in payload parameters. Field experiments further validate the framework, confirming its practical applicability and reliable performance in outdoor environments using only off-the-shelf aerial vehicle hardware.

Title: A Dynamically Weighted ADMM Framework for Byzantine Resilience
Authors: Vishnu Vijay, Kartik A. Pant, Minhyun Cho, Inseok Hwang
Abstract: The alternating direction of multipliers method (ADMM) is a popular method to solve distributed consensus optimization utilizing efficient communication among various nodes in the network. However, in the presence of faulty or attacked nodes, even a small perturbation (or sharing false data) during the communication can lead to divergence of the solution. To address this issue, in this work we consider ADMM under the effect of Byzantine threat, where an unknown subset of nodes is subject to Byzantine attacks or faults. We propose Dynamically Weighted ADMM (DW-ADMM), a novel variant of ADMM that uses dynamic weights on the edges of the network, thus promoting resilient distributed optimization. We establish that the proposed method (i) produces a nearly identical solution to conventional ADMM in the error-free case, and (ii) guarantees a bounded solution with respect to the global minimizer, even under Byzantine threat. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm using an illustrative numerical simulation.

Title: Nominal Evaluation Of Automatic Multi-Sections Control Potential In Comparison To A Simpler One- Or Two-Sections Alternative With Predictive Spray Switching
Authors: Mogens Plessen
Abstract: Automatic Section Control (ASC) is a long-standing trend for spraying in agriculture. It promises to minimise spray overlap areas. The core idea is to (i) switch off spray nozzles on areas that have already been sprayed, and (ii) to dynamically adjust nozzle flow rates along the boom bar that holds the spray nozzles when velocities of boom sections vary during turn maneuvers. ASC is not possible without sensors, in particular for accurate positioning data. Spraying and the movement of modern wide boom bars are highly dynamic processes. In addition, many uncertainty factors have an effect such as cross wind drift, boom height, nozzle clogging in open-field conditions, and so forth. In view of this complexity, the natural question arises if a simpler alternative exist. Therefore, an Automatic Multi-Sections Control method is compared to a proposed simpler one- or two-sections alternative that uses predictive spray switching. The comparison is provided under nominal conditions. Agricultural spraying is intrinsically linked to area coverage path planning and spray switching logic. Combinations of two area coverage path planning and switching logics as well as three sections-setups are compared. The three sections-setups differ by controlling 48 sections, 2 sections or controlling all nozzles uniformly with the same control signal as one single section. Methods are evaluated on 10 diverse real-world field examples, including non-convex field contours, freeform mainfield lanes and multiple obstacle areas. A preferred method is suggested that (i) minimises area coverage pathlength, (ii) offers intermediate overlap, (iii) is suitable for manual driving by following a pre-planned predictive spray switching logic for an area coverage path plan, and (iv) and in contrast to ASC can be implemented sensor-free and therefore at low cost.

Title: Representing Speech Through Autoregressive Prediction of Cochlear Tokens
Authors: Greta Tuckute, Klemen Kotar, Evelina Fedorenko, Daniel L.K. Yamins
Abstract: We introduce AuriStream, a biologically inspired model for encoding speech via a two-stage framework inspired by the human auditory processing hierarchy. The first stage transforms raw audio into a time-frequency representation based on the human cochlea, from which we extract discrete \textbf{cochlear tokens}. The second stage applies an autoregressive sequence model over the cochlear tokens. AuriStream learns meaningful phoneme and word representations, and state-of-the-art lexical semantics. AuriStream shows competitive performance on diverse downstream SUPERB speech tasks. Complementing AuriStream's strong representational capabilities, it generates continuations of audio which can be visualized in a spectrogram space and decoded back into audio, providing insights into the model's predictions. In summary, we present a two-stage framework for speech representation learning to advance the development of more human-like models that efficiently handle a range of speech-based tasks.

Title: Pretrained Conformers for Audio Fingerprinting and Retrieval
Authors: Kemal Altwlkany, Elmedin Selmanovic, Sead Delalic
Abstract: Conformers have shown great results in speech processing due to their ability to capture both local and global interactions. In this work, we utilize a self-supervised contrastive learning framework to train conformer-based encoders that are capable of generating unique embeddings for small segments of audio, generalizing well to previously unseen data. We achieve state-of-the-art results for audio retrieval tasks while using only 3 seconds of audio to generate embeddings. Our models are almost completely immune to temporal misalignments and achieve state-of-the-art results in cases of other audio distortions such as noise, reverb or extreme temporal stretching. Code and models are made publicly available and the results are easy to reproduce as we train and test using popular and freely available datasets of different sizes.

Title: Synthetic Data for Robust Stroke Segmentation
Authors: Liam Chalcroft, Ioannis Pappas, Cathy J. Price, John Ashburner
Abstract: Current deep learning-based approaches to lesion segmentation in neuroimaging often depend on high-resolution images and extensive annotated data, limiting clinical applicability. This paper introduces a novel synthetic data framework tailored for stroke lesion segmentation, expanding the SynthSeg methodology to incorporate lesion-specific augmentations that simulate diverse pathological features. Using a modified nnUNet architecture, our approach trains models with label maps from healthy and stroke datasets, facilitating segmentation across both normal and pathological tissue without reliance on specific sequence-based training. Evaluation across in-domain and out-of-domain (OOD) datasets reveals that our method matches state-of-the-art performance within the training domain and significantly outperforms existing methods on OOD data. By minimizing dependence on large annotated datasets and allowing for cross-sequence applicability, our framework holds potential to improve clinical neuroimaging workflows, particularly in stroke pathology. PyTorch training code and weights are publicly available at this https URL, along with an SPM toolbox featuring a plug-and-play model at this https URL.

Title: High Resolution Millimeter Wave Imaging Based on FMCW Radar Systems at W-Band
Authors: Shahrokh Hamidi, M.R. Nezhad-Ahmadi
Abstract: In this paper, we present a unique $\text {2D}$ high resolution, compact, low-cost, lightweight, and highly accurate millimeter wave imagery system capable of operating in all weather conditions. We describe millimeter wave imaging process in detail and present several novel signal processing methods with their applications. To create the array, we utilize the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) concept. The imagery system presented in this paper, can strongly compete with Lidar systems as the resolution limit is at the same level. Furthermore, in contrast to the Lidar systems, our imagery system can operate in heavy rain and dense fog and produce high quality images. Finally, we utilize our wide-band custom-made Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar, which operates at W-band with $\text {33 GHz}$ bandwidth, for data collection and present the results.

Title: Automatic brain tumor segmentation in 2D intra-operative ultrasound images using magnetic resonance imaging tumor annotations
Authors: Mathilde Faanes, Ragnhild Holden Helland, Ole Solheim, S√©bastien Muller, Ingerid Reinertsen
Abstract: Automatic segmentation of brain tumors in intra-operative ultrasound (iUS) images could facilitate localization of tumor tissue during resection surgery. The lack of large annotated datasets limits the current models performances. In this paper, we investigated the use of tumor annotations in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, which are more accessible than annotations in iUS images, for training of deep learning models for iUS brain tumor segmentation. We used 180 annotated MRI scans with corresponding unannotated iUS images, and 29 annotated iUS images. Image registration was performed to transfer the MRI annotations to the corresponding iUS images before training the nnU-Net model with different configurations of the data and label origins. The results showed no significant difference in Dice score for a model trained with only MRI annotated tumors compared to models trained with only iUS annotations and both, and to expert annotations, indicating that MRI tumor annotations can be used as a substitute for iUS tumor annotations to train a deep learning model for automatic brain tumor segmentation in iUS images. The best model obtained an average Dice score of $0.62\pm0.31$, compared to $0.67\pm0.25$ for an expert neurosurgeon, where the performance on larger tumors were similar, but lower for the models on smaller tumors. In addition, the results showed that removing smaller tumors from the training sets improved the results. The main models are available here: this https URL

Title: GDSR: Global-Detail Integration through Dual-Branch Network with Wavelet Losses for Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution
Authors: Qiwei Zhu, Kai Li, Guojing Zhang, Xiaoying Wang, Jianqiang Huang, Xilai Li
Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks, Transformers, and State Space Models, have achieved significant progress in Remote Sensing Image (RSI) Super-Resolution (SR). However, existing SR methods typically overlook the complementary relationship between global and local dependencies. These methods either focus on capturing local information or prioritize global information, which results in models that are unable to effectively capture both global and local features simultaneously. Moreover, their computational cost becomes prohibitive when applied to large-scale RSIs. To address these challenges, we introduce the novel application of Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) to RSI-SR, which captures long-range dependencies with linear complexity. To simultaneously model global and local features, we propose the Global-Detail dual-branch structure, GDSR, which performs SR by paralleling RWKV and convolutional operations to handle large-scale RSIs. Furthermore, we introduce the Global-Detail Reconstruction Module (GDRM) as an intermediary between the two branches to bridge their complementary roles. In addition, we propose the Dual-Group Multi-Scale Wavelet Loss, a wavelet-domain constraint mechanism via dual-group subband strategy and cross-resolution frequency alignment for enhanced reconstruction fidelity in RSI-SR. Extensive experiments under two degradation methods on several benchmarks, including AID, UCMerced, and RSSRD-QH, demonstrate that GSDR outperforms the state-of-the-art Transformer-based method HAT by an average of 0.09 dB in PSNR, while using only 63% of its parameters and 51% of its FLOPs, achieving an inference speed 3.2 times faster.

Title: A Transferable Physics-Informed Framework for Battery Degradation Diagnosis, Knee-Onset Detection and Knee Prediction
Authors: Huang Zhang, Xixi Liu, Faisal Altaf, Torsten Wik
Abstract: The techno-economic and safety concerns of battery capacity knee occurrence call for developing online knee detection and prediction methods as an advanced battery management system (BMS) function. To address this, a transferable physics-informed framework that consists of a histogram-based feature engineering method, a hybrid physics-informed model, and a fine-tuning strategy, is proposed for online battery degradation diagnosis and knee-onset detection. The hybrid model is first developed and evaluated using a scenario-aware pipeline in protocol cycling scenarios and then fine-tuned to create local models deployed in a dynamic cycling scenario. A 2D histogram-based 17-feature set is found to be the best choice in both source and target scenarios. The fine-tuning strategy is proven to be effective in improving battery degradation mode estimation and degradation phase detection performance in the target scenario. Again, a strong linear correlation was found between the identified knee-onset and knee points. As a result, advanced BMS functions, such as online degradation diagnosis and prognosis, online knee-onset detection and knee prediction, aging-aware battery classification, and second-life repurposing, can be enabled through a battery performance digital twin in the cloud.

Title: Propeller Motion of a Devil-Stick using Normal Forcing
Authors: Aakash Khandelwal, Ranjan Mukherjee
Abstract: The problem of realizing rotary propeller motion of a devil-stick in the vertical plane using forces purely normal to the stick is considered. This problem represents a nonprehensile manipulation task of an underactuated system. In contrast with previous approaches, the devil-stick is manipulated by controlling the normal force and its point of application. Virtual holonomic constraints are used to design the trajectory of the center-of-mass of the devil-stick in terms of its orientation angle, and conditions for stable propeller motion are derived. Intermittent large-amplitude forces are used to asymptotically stabilize a desired propeller motion. Simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the approach in realizing stable propeller motion without loss of contact between the actuator and devil-stick.

Title: Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communications for Secure UAV Networks
Authors: Jingjing Zhao, Songtao Xue, Kaiquan Cai, Xidong Mu, Yuanwei Liu, Yanbo Zhu
Abstract: A novel near-field integrated sensing and communications framework for secure unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks with high time efficiency is proposed. A ground base station (GBS) with large aperture size communicates with one communication UAV (C-UAV) under the existence of one eavesdropping UAV (E-UAV), where the artificial noise (AN) is employed for both jamming and sensing purpose. Given that the E-UAV's motion model is unknown at the GBS, we first propose a near-field localization and trajectory tracking scheme. Specifically, exploiting the variant Doppler shift observations over the spatial domain in the near field, the E-UAV's three-dimensional (3D) velocities are estimated from echo signals. To provide the timely correction of location prediction errors, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) is adopted to fuse the predicted states and the measured ones. Subsequently, based on the real-time predicated location of the E-UAV, we further propose a joint GBS beamforming and C-UAV trajectory design scheme for maximizing the instantaneous secrecy rate, while guaranteeing the sensing accuracy constraint. To solve the resultant non-convex problem, an alternating optimization approach is developed, where the near-field GBS beamforming and the C-UAV trajectory design subproblems are iteratively solved by exploiting the successive convex approximation method. Finally, our numerical results unveil that: 1) the E-UAV's 3D velocities and location can be accurately estimated in real time with our proposed framework by exploiting the near-field spherical wave propagation; and 2) the proposed framework achieves superior secrecy rate compared to benchmark schemes and closely approaches the performance when the E-UAV trajectory is perfectly known.

Title: Decentralized State Estimation and Opacity Verification Based on Partially Ordered Observation Sequences
Authors: Dajiang Sun, Christoforos N. Hadjicostis, Zhiwu Li
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate state estimation and opacity verification problems within a decentralized observation architecture. Specifically, we consider a discrete event system whose behavior is recorded by a set of observation sites. These sites transmit the partially ordered sequences of observations that they record to a coordinator whenever a synchronization occurs. To properly analyze the system behavior from the coordinator's viewpoint, we first introduce the notion of a Complete Synchronizing Sequence structure (CSS structure), which concisely captures the state evolution of each system state upon different information provided by the observation sites. Based on the CSS structure, we then construct corresponding current-state and initial-state estimators for offline state estimation at the coordinator. When used to verify state-isolation properties under this decentralized architecture, the use of CSS structure demonstrates a significant reduction in complexity compared with existing approaches in the literature. In particular, we discuss how to verify initial-state opacity at the coordinator, as well as a novel opacity notion, namely current-state-at-synchronization opacity.

Title: Generalizable speech deepfake detection via meta-learned LoRA
Authors: Janne Laakkonen, Ivan Kukanov, Ville Hautam√§ki
Abstract: Reliable detection of speech deepfakes (spoofs) must remain effective when the distribution of spoofing attacks shifts. We frame the task as domain generalization and show that inserting Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters into every attention head of a self-supervised (SSL) backbone, then training only those adapters with Meta-Learning Domain Generalization (MLDG), yields strong zero-shot performance. The resulting model updates about 3.6 million parameters, roughly 1.1% of the 318 million updated in full fine-tuning, yet surpasses a fully fine-tuned counterpart on five of six evaluation corpora. A first-order MLDG loop encourages the adapters to focus on cues that persist across attack types, lowering the average EER from 8.84% for the fully fine-tuned model to 5.30% with our best MLDG-LoRA configuration. Our findings show that combining meta-learning with parameter-efficient adaptation offers an effective method for zero-shot, distribution-shift-aware speech deepfake detection.

Title: HealthiVert-GAN: A Novel Framework of Pseudo-Healthy Vertebral Image Synthesis for Interpretable Compression Fracture Grading
Authors: Qi Zhang, Cheng Chuang, Shunan Zhang, Ziqi Zhao, Kun Wang, Jun Xu, Jianqi Sun
Abstract: Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) are prevalent in the elderly population, typically assessed on computed tomography (CT) scans by evaluating vertebral height loss. This assessment helps determine the fracture's impact on spinal stability and the need for surgical intervention. However, the absence of pre-fracture CT scans and standardized vertebral references leads to measurement errors and inter-observer variability, while irregular compression patterns further challenge the precise grading of fracture severity. While deep learning methods have shown promise in aiding OVCFs screening, they often lack interpretability and sufficient sensitivity, limiting their clinical applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel vertebra synthesis-height loss quantification-OVCFs grading framework. Our proposed model, HealthiVert-GAN, utilizes a coarse-to-fine synthesis network designed to generate pseudo-healthy vertebral images that simulate the pre-fracture state of fractured vertebrae. This model integrates three auxiliary modules that leverage the morphology and height information of adjacent healthy vertebrae to ensure anatomical consistency. Additionally, we introduce the Relative Height Loss of Vertebrae (RHLV) as a quantification metric, which divides each vertebra into three sections to measure height loss between pre-fracture and post-fracture states, followed by fracture severity classification using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art classification performance on both the Verse2019 dataset and in-house dataset, and it provides cross-sectional distribution maps of vertebral height loss. This practical tool enhances diagnostic accuracy in clinical settings and assisting in surgical decision-making.

Title: Pathology-Guided AI System for Accurate Segmentation and Diagnosis of Cervical Spondylosis
Authors: Qi Zhang, Xiuyuan Chen, Ziyi He, Lianming Wu, Kun Wang, Jianqi Sun, Hongxing Shen
Abstract: Cervical spondylosis, a complex and prevalent condition, demands precise and efficient diagnostic techniques for accurate assessment. While MRI offers detailed visualization of cervical spine anatomy, manual interpretation remains labor-intensive and prone to error. To address this, we developed an innovative AI-assisted Expert-based Diagnosis System that automates both segmentation and diagnosis of cervical spondylosis using MRI. Leveraging multi-center datasets of cervical MRI images from patients with cervical spondylosis, our system features a pathology-guided segmentation model capable of accurately segmenting key cervical anatomical structures. The segmentation is followed by an expert-based diagnostic framework that automates the calculation of critical clinical indicators. Our segmentation model achieved an impressive average Dice coefficient exceeding 0.90 across four cervical spinal anatomies and demonstrated enhanced accuracy in herniation areas. Diagnostic evaluation further showcased the system's precision, with the lowest mean average errors (MAE) for the C2-C7 Cobb angle and the Maximum Spinal Cord Compression (MSCC) coefficient. In addition, our method delivered high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores in herniation localization, K-line status assessment, T2 hyperintensity detection, and Kang grading. Comparative analysis and external validation demonstrate that our system outperforms existing methods, establishing a new benchmark for segmentation and diagnostic tasks for cervical spondylosis.

Title: HepatoGEN: Generating Hepatobiliary Phase MRI with Perceptual and Adversarial Models
Authors: Jens Hooge, Gerard Sanroma-Guell, Faidra Stavropoulou, Alexander Ullmann, Gesine Knobloch, Mark Klemens, Carola Schmidt, Sabine Weckbach, Andreas Bolz
Abstract: Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) plays a crucial role in the detection and characterization of focal liver lesions, with the hepatobiliary phase (HBP) providing essential diagnostic information. However, acquiring HBP images requires prolonged scan times, which may compromise patient comfort and scanner throughput. In this study, we propose a deep learning based approach for synthesizing HBP images from earlier contrast phases (precontrast and transitional) and compare three generative models: a perceptual U-Net, a perceptual GAN (pGAN), and a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). We curated a multi-site DCE-MRI dataset from diverse clinical settings and introduced a contrast evolution score (CES) to assess training data quality, enhancing model performance. Quantitative evaluation using pixel-wise and perceptual metrics, combined with qualitative assessment through blinded radiologist reviews, showed that pGAN achieved the best quantitative performance but introduced heterogeneous contrast in out-of-distribution cases. In contrast, the U-Net produced consistent liver enhancement with fewer artifacts, while DDPM underperformed due to limited preservation of fine structural details. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of synthetic HBP image generation as a means to reduce scan time without compromising diagnostic utility, highlighting the clinical potential of deep learning for dynamic contrast enhancement in liver MRI.

Title: Multi-Class Stackelberg Games for the Co-Design of Networked Systems
Authors: Julian Barreiro-Gomez, Ye Wang
Abstract: We investigate a co-design problem, encompassing simultaneous design of system infrastructure and control, through a game-theoretical framework. To this end, we propose the co-design problem as a two-layer hierarchical strategic interaction. At the upper layer, a leader (or multiple leaders) determines system design parameters, while at the lower layer, a follower (or multiple followers) optimizes the control strategy. To capture this hierarchy, we propose four novel classes of Stackelberg games that integrate diverse strategic behaviors, including combinations of cooperative and non-cooperative interactions across two different layers. Notably, the leaders' interactions are represented using a normal-form game, whereas the followers' interactions are modeled by different games (dynamic games in discrete time). These distinct game structures result in a Stackelberg game that accommodates different game types per layer, and/or supports heterogeneous strategic behaviors involving cooperation and non-cooperation simultaneously. Learning algorithms using the best-response dynamics are used to solve the game problems when considering a discrete strategic space for the leaders. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through an application to the co-design of the Barcelona drinking water network.

Title: When Vision-Language Model (VLM) Meets Beam Prediction: A Multimodal Contrastive Learning Framework
Authors: Ji Wang, Bin Tang, Jian Xiao, Qimei Cui, Xingwang Li, Tony Q. S. Quek
Abstract: As the real propagation environment becomes in creasingly complex and dynamic, millimeter wave beam prediction faces huge challenges. However, the powerful cross modal representation capability of vision-language model (VLM) provides a promising approach. The traditional methods that rely on real-time channel state information (CSI) are computationally expensive and often fail to maintain accuracy in such environments. In this paper, we present a VLM-driven contrastive learning based multimodal beam prediction framework that integrates multimodal data via modality-specific encoders. To enforce cross-modal consistency, we adopt a contrastive pretraining strategy to align image and LiDAR features in the latent space. We use location information as text prompts and connect it to the text encoder to introduce language modality, which further improves cross-modal consistency. Experiments on the DeepSense-6G dataset show that our VLM backbone provides additional semantic grounding. Compared with existing methods, the overall distance-based accuracy score (DBA-Score) of 0.9016, corresponding to 1.46% average improvement.

Title: Spectral Efficiency-Aware Codebook Design for Task-Oriented Semantic Communications
Authors: Anbang Zhang, Shuaishuai Guo, Chenyuan Feng, Shuai Liu, Hongyang Du, Geyong Min
Abstract: Digital task-oriented semantic communication (ToSC) aims to transmit only task-relevant information, significantly reducing communication overhead. Existing ToSC methods typically rely on learned codebooks to encode semantic features and map them to constellation symbols. However, these codebooks are often sparsely activated, resulting in low spectral efficiency and underutilization of channel capacity. This highlights a key challenge: how to design a codebook that not only supports task-specific inference but also approaches the theoretical limits of channel capacity. To address this challenge, we construct a spectral efficiency-aware codebook design framework that explicitly incorporates the codebook activation probability into the optimization process. Beyond maximizing task performance, we introduce the Wasserstein (WS) distance as a regularization metric to minimize the gap between the learned activation distribution and the optimal channel input distribution. Furthermore, we reinterpret WS theory from a generative perspective to align with the semantic nature of ToSC. Combining the above two aspects, we propose a WS-based adaptive hybrid distribution scheme, termed WS-DC, which learns compact, task-driven and channel-aware latent representations. Experimental results demonstrate that WS-DC not only outperforms existing approaches in inference accuracy but also significantly improves codebook efficiency, offering a promising direction toward capacity-approaching semantic communication systems.

Title: Fairness in Dysarthric Speech Synthesis: Understanding Intrinsic Bias in Dysarthric Speech Cloning using F5-TTS
Authors: M Anuprabha, Krishna Gurugubelli, Anil Kumar Vuppala
Abstract: Dysarthric speech poses significant challenges in developing assistive technologies, primarily due to the limited availability of data. Recent advances in neural speech synthesis, especially zero-shot voice cloning, facilitate synthetic speech generation for data augmentation; however, they may introduce biases towards dysarthric speech. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art F5-TTS in cloning dysarthric speech using TORGO dataset, focusing on intelligibility, speaker similarity, and prosody preservation. We also analyze potential biases using fairness metrics like Disparate Impact and Parity Difference to assess disparities across dysarthric severity levels. Results show that F5-TTS exhibits a strong bias toward speech intelligibility over speaker and prosody preservation in dysarthric speech synthesis. Insights from this study can help integrate fairness-aware dysarthric speech synthesis, fostering the advancement of more inclusive speech technologies.

Title: MultiAiTutor: Child-Friendly Educational Multilingual Speech Generation Tutor with LLMs
Authors: Xiaoxue Gao, Huayun Zhang, Nancy F. Chen
Abstract: Generative speech models have demonstrated significant potential in personalizing teacher-student interactions, offering valuable real-world applications for language learning in children's education. However, achieving high-quality, child-friendly speech generation remains challenging, particularly for low-resource languages across diverse languages and cultural contexts. In this paper, we propose MultiAiTutor, an educational multilingual generative AI tutor with child-friendly designs, leveraging LLM architecture for speech generation tailored for educational purposes. We propose to integrate age-appropriate multilingual speech generation using LLM architectures, facilitating young children's language learning through culturally relevant image-description tasks in three low-resource languages: Singaporean-accent Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil. Experimental results from both objective metrics and subjective evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MultiAiTutor compared to baseline methods.

Title: From Explainable to Explained AI: Ideas for Falsifying and Quantifying Explanations
Authors: Yoni Schirris, Eric Marcus, Jonas Teuwen, Hugo Horlings, Efstratios Gavves
Abstract: Explaining deep learning models is essential for clinical integration of medical image analysis systems. A good explanation highlights if a model depends on spurious features that undermines generalization and harms a subset of patients or, conversely, may present novel biological insights. Although techniques like GradCAM can identify influential features, they are measurement tools that do not themselves form an explanation. We propose a human-machine-VLM interaction system tailored to explaining classifiers in computational pathology, including multi-instance learning for whole-slide images. Our proof of concept comprises (1) an AI-integrated slide viewer to run sliding-window experiments to test claims of an explanation, and (2) quantification of an explanation's predictiveness using general-purpose vision-language models. The results demonstrate that this allows us to qualitatively test claims of explanations and can quantifiably distinguish competing explanations. This offers a practical path from explainable AI to explained AI in digital pathology and beyond. Code and prompts are available at this https URL.

Title: Quantifying the Value of Seismic Structural Health Monitoring for post-earthquake recovery of electric power system in terms of resilience enhancement
Authors: Huangbin Liang, Beatriz Moya, Francisco Chinesta, Eleni Chatzi
Abstract: Post-earthquake recovery of electric power networks (EPNs) is critical to community resilience. Traditional recovery processes often rely on prolonged and imprecise manual inspections for damage diagnosis, leading to suboptimal repair prioritization and extended service disruptions. Seismic Structural Health Monitoring (SSHM) offers the potential to expedite recovery by enabling more accurate and timely damage assessment. However, SSHM deployment incurs costs, and its system-level resilience benefit remains underexplored. This study proposes a probabilistic simulation framework to quantify the value of SSHM for enhancing EPN resilience. The framework includes seismic damage modeling based on network configuration, hazard intensity, fragility functions, and damage-functionality mappings, combined with recovery simulations incorporating resource constraints, repair and transfer durations. System functionality is evaluated using graph-based island detection and optimal power flow analysis. Resilience is quantified via the Lack of Resilience (LoR) metric derived from the functionality restoration curve. SSHM is incorporated by altering the quality of damage information used in repair scheduling. Different monitoring scenarios (e.g., no-SSHM baseline, partial SSHM, full SSHM with various accuracies) are modeled using confusion matrices to simulate damage misclassification. Results show that improved damage awareness via SSHM significantly accelerates recovery and reduces LoR by up to 21%. This work supports evidence-based decisions for SSHM deployment in critical infrastructure.

Title: LQG Information Design
Authors: Masaki Miyashita, Takashi Ui
Abstract: This paper addresses information design in a workhorse model of network games, where agents have linear best responses, the information designer maximizes a quadratic objective, and the payoff-relevant state follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution. We formulate the problem as a semidefinite program and establish strong duality to characterize the optimal information structure. A necessary and sufficient condition for optimality is given by a simple linear relationship between the induced equilibrium strategy profile and the state. Leveraging this characterization, we show that the state is fully revealed in an aggregative form for welfare maximization, while individual agents may remain only partially informed. When agent roles are interchangeable, the optimal information structure inherits the same degree of symmetry, which facilitates computation. In such cases, we show that the optimal amount of information revealed to each agent is closely linked to the network's chromatic number.

Title: Embedding Safety into RL: A New Take on Trust Region Methods
Authors: Nikola Milosevic, Johannes M√ºller, Nico Scherf
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents can solve diverse tasks but often exhibit unsafe behavior. Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) address this by enforcing safety constraints, yet existing methods either sacrifice reward maximization or allow unsafe training. We introduce Constrained Trust Region Policy Optimization (C-TRPO), which reshapes the policy space geometry to ensure trust regions contain only safe policies, guaranteeing constraint satisfaction throughout training. We analyze its theoretical properties and connections to TRPO, Natural Policy Gradient (NPG), and Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO). Experiments show that C-TRPO reduces constraint violations while maintaining competitive returns.

Title: MARS-FTCP: Robust Fault-Tolerant Control and Agile Trajectory Planning for Modular Aerial Robot Systems
Authors: Rui Huang, Zhenyu Zhang, Siyu Tang, Zhiqian Cai, Lin Zhao
Abstract: Modular Aerial Robot Systems (MARS) consist of multiple drone units that can self-reconfigure to adapt to various mission requirements and fault conditions. However, existing fault-tolerant control methods exhibit significant oscillations during docking and separation, impacting system stability. To address this issue, we propose a novel fault-tolerant control reallocation method that adapts to an arbitrary number of modular robots and their assembly formations. The algorithm redistributes the expected collective force and torque required for MARS to individual units according to their moment arm relative to the center of MARS mass. Furthermore, we propose an agile trajectory planning method for MARS of arbitrary configurations, which is collision-avoiding and dynamically feasible. Our work represents the first comprehensive approach to enable fault-tolerant and collision avoidance flight for MARS. We validate our method through extensive simulations, demonstrating improved fault tolerance, enhanced trajectory tracking accuracy, and greater robustness in cluttered environments.

Title: Safe Multi-Robotic Arm Interaction via 3D Convex Shapes
Authors: Ali Umut Kaypak, Shiqing Wei, Prashanth Krishnamurthy, Farshad Khorrami
Abstract: Inter-robot collisions pose a significant safety risk when multiple robotic arms operate in close proximity. We present an online collision avoidance methodology leveraging 3D convex shape-based High-Order Control Barrier Functions (HOCBFs) to address this issue. While prior works focused on using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for human-robotic arm and single-arm collision avoidance, we explore the problem of collision avoidance between multiple robotic arms operating in a shared space. In our methodology, we utilize the proposed HOCBFs as centralized and decentralized safety filters. These safety filters are compatible with many nominal controllers and ensure safety without significantly restricting the robots' workspace. A key challenge in implementing these filters is the computational overhead caused by the large number of safety constraints and the computation of a Hessian matrix per constraint. We address this challenge by employing numerical differentiation methods to approximate computationally intensive terms. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through extensive simulation studies and real-world experiments with Franka Research 3 robotic arms. The project video is available at this link.

Title: Med3DVLM: An Efficient Vision-Language Model for 3D Medical Image Analysis
Authors: Yu Xin, Gorkem Can Ates, Kuang Gong, Wei Shao
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in 2D medical image analysis, but extending them to 3D remains challenging due to the high computational demands of volumetric data and the difficulty of aligning 3D spatial features with clinical text. We present Med3DVLM, a 3D VLM designed to address these challenges through three key innovations: (1) DCFormer, an efficient encoder that uses decomposed 3D convolutions to capture fine-grained spatial features at scale; (2) SigLIP, a contrastive learning strategy with pairwise sigmoid loss that improves image-text alignment without relying on large negative batches; and (3) a dual-stream MLP-Mixer projector that fuses low- and high-level image features with text embeddings for richer multi-modal representations. We evaluate our model on the M3D dataset, which includes radiology reports and VQA data for 120,084 3D medical images. Results show that Med3DVLM achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks. For image-text retrieval, it reaches 61.00% R@1 on 2,000 samples, significantly outperforming the current state-of-the-art M3D model (19.10%). For report generation, it achieves a METEOR score of 36.42% (vs. 14.38%). In open-ended visual question answering (VQA), it scores 36.76% METEOR (vs. 33.58%), and in closed-ended VQA, it achieves 79.95% accuracy (vs. 75.78%). These results highlight Med3DVLM's ability to bridge the gap between 3D imaging and language, enabling scalable, multi-task reasoning across clinical applications.

Title: Neurodyne: Neural Pitch Manipulation with Representation Learning and Cycle-Consistency GAN
Authors: Yicheng Gu, Chaoren Wang, Zhizheng Wu, Lauri Juvela
Abstract: Pitch manipulation is the process of producers adjusting the pitch of an audio segment to a specific key and intonation, which is essential in music production. Neural-network-based pitch-manipulation systems have been popular in recent years due to their superior synthesis quality compared to classical DSP methods. However, their performance is still limited due to their inaccurate feature disentanglement using source-filter models and the lack of paired in- and out-of-tune training data. This work proposes Neurodyne to address these issues. Specifically, Neurodyne uses adversarial representation learning to learn a pitch-independent latent representation to avoid inaccurate disentanglement and cycle-consistency training to create paired training data implicitly. Experimental results on global-key and template-based pitch manipulation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, marking improved synthesis quality while maintaining the original singer identity.

Title: Transferable Parasitic Estimation via Graph Contrastive Learning and Label Rebalancing in AMS Circuits
Authors: Shan Shen, Shenglu Hua, Jiajun Zou, Jiawei Liu, Jianwang Zhai, Chuan Shi, Wenjian Yu
Abstract: Graph representation learning on Analog-Mixed Signal (AMS) circuits is crucial for various downstream tasks, e.g., parasitic estimation. However, the scarcity of design data, the unbalanced distribution of labels, and the inherent diversity of circuit implementations pose significant challenges to learning robust and transferable circuit representations. To address these limitations, we propose CircuitGCL, a novel graph contrastive learning framework that integrates representation scattering and label rebalancing to enhance transferability across heterogeneous circuit graphs. CircuitGCL employs a self-supervised strategy to learn topology-invariant node embeddings through hyperspherical representation scattering, eliminating dependency on large-scale data. Simultaneously, balanced mean squared error (BMSE) and balanced softmax cross-entropy (BSCE) losses are introduced to mitigate label distribution disparities between circuits, enabling robust and transferable parasitic estimation. Evaluated on parasitic capacitance estimation (edge-level task) and ground capacitance classification (node-level task) across TSMC 28nm AMS designs, CircuitGCL outperforms all state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with the $R^2$ improvement of $33.64\% \sim 44.20\%$ for edge regression and F1-score gain of $0.9\times \sim 2.1\times$ for node classification.

Title: Part Segmentation of Human Meshes via Multi-View Human Parsing
Authors: James Dickens, Kamyar Hamad
Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud deep learning have led to models that achieve high per-part labeling accuracy on large-scale point clouds, using only the raw geometry of unordered point sets. In parallel, the field of human parsing focuses on predicting body part and clothing/accessory labels from images. This work aims to bridge these two domains by enabling per-vertex semantic segmentation of large-scale human meshes. To achieve this, a pseudo-ground truth labeling pipeline is developed for the Thuman2.1 dataset: meshes are first aligned to a canonical pose, segmented from multiple viewpoints, and the resulting point-level labels are then backprojected onto the original mesh to produce per-point pseudo ground truth annotations. Subsequently, a novel, memory-efficient sampling strategy is introduced, a windowed iterative farthest point sampling (FPS) with space-filling curve-based serialization to effectively downsample the point clouds. This is followed by a purely geometric segmentation using PointTransformer, enabling semantic parsing of human meshes without relying on texture information. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach. Project code and pre-processed data is available at this https URL.

Title: Random Walk Learning and the Pac-Man Attack
Authors: Xingran Chen, Parimal Parag, Rohit Bhagat, Zonghong Liu, Salim El Rouayheb
Abstract: Random walk (RW)-based algorithms have long been popular in distributed systems due to low overheads and scalability, with recent growing applications in decentralized learning. However, their reliance on local interactions makes them inherently vulnerable to malicious behavior. In this work, we investigate an adversarial threat that we term the ``Pac-Man'' attack, in which a malicious node probabilistically terminates any RW that visits it. This stealthy behavior gradually eliminates active RWs from the network, effectively halting the learning process without triggering failure alarms. To counter this threat, we propose the Average Crossing (AC) algorithm--a fully decentralized mechanism for duplicating RWs to prevent RW extinction in the presence of Pac-Man. Our theoretical analysis establishes that (i) the RW population remains almost surely bounded under AC and (ii) RW-based stochastic gradient descent remains convergent under AC, even in the presence of Pac-Man, with a quantifiable deviation from the true optimum. Our extensive empirical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate our theoretical findings. Furthermore, they uncover a phase transition in the extinction probability as a function of the duplication threshold. We offer theoretical insights by analyzing a simplified variant of the AC, which sheds light on the observed phase transition.

Title: SynBrain: Enhancing Visual-to-fMRI Synthesis via Probabilistic Representation Learning
Authors: Weijian Mai, Jiamin Wu, Yu Zhu, Zhouheng Yao, Dongzhan Zhou, Andrew F. Luo, Qihao Zheng, Wanli Ouyang, Chunfeng Song
Abstract: Deciphering how visual stimuli are transformed into cortical responses is a fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. This visual-to-neural mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability. The code will be made publicly available.
