Title: Discovering phoneme-specific critical articulators through a data-driven approach
Authors: Jesuraj Bandekar, Sathvik Udupa, Prasanta Kumar Ghosh
Abstract: We propose an approach for learning critical articulators for phonemes through a machine learning approach. We formulate the learning with three models trained end to end. First, we use Acoustic to Articulatory Inversion (AAI) to predict time-varying speech articulators EMA. We also predict the phoneme-specific weights across articulators for each frame. To avoid overfitting, we also add a dropout layer before the weights prediction layer. Next, we normalize the predicted weights across articulators using min-max normalization for each frame. The normalized weights are multiplied by the ground truth $EMA$ and then we try to predict the phones at each frame. We train this whole setup end to end and use two losses. One loss is for the phone prediction which is the cross entropy loss and the other is for the AAI prediction which is the mean squared error loss. To maintain gradient flow between the phone prediction block and the $EMA$ prediction block, we use straight-through estimation. The goal here is to predict the weights of the articulator at each frame while training the model end to end.

Title: Noise Modeling in One Hour: Minimizing Preparation Efforts for Self-supervised Low-Light RAW Image Denoising
Authors: Feiran Li, Haiyang Jiang, Daisuke Iso
Abstract: Noise synthesis is a promising solution for addressing the data shortage problem in data-driven low-light RAW image denoising. However, accurate noise synthesis methods often necessitate labor-intensive calibration and profiling procedures during preparation, preventing them from landing to practice at scale. This work introduces a practically simple noise synthesis pipeline based on detailed analyses of noise properties and extensive justification of widespread techniques. Compared to other approaches, our proposed pipeline eliminates the cumbersome system gain calibration and signal-independent noise profiling steps, reducing the preparation time for noise synthesis from days to hours. Meanwhile, our method exhibits strong denoising performance, showing an up to 0.54dB PSNR improvement over the current state-of-the-art noise synthesis technique. Code is released at this https URL

Title: SR-NeRV: Improving Embedding Efficiency of Neural Video Representation via Super-Resolution
Authors: Taiga Hayami, Kakeru Koizumi, Hiroshi Watanabe
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have garnered significant attention for their ability to model complex signals across a variety of domains. Recently, INR-based approaches have emerged as promising frameworks for neural video compression. While conventional methods primarily focus on embedding video content into compact neural networks for efficient representation, they often struggle to reconstruct high-frequency details under stringent model size constraints, which are critical in practical compression scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose an INR-based video representation method that integrates a general-purpose super-resolution (SR) network. Motivated by the observation that high-frequency components exhibit low temporal redundancy across frames, our method entrusts the reconstruction of fine details to the SR network. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional INR-based baselines in terms of reconstruction quality, while maintaining comparable model sizes.

Title: Rootlets-based registration to the spinal cord PAM50 template
Authors: Sandrine Bédard, Jan Valošek, Valeria Oliva, Kenneth A. Weber II, Julien Cohen-Adad
Abstract: Spinal cord functional MRI studies require precise localization of spinal levels for reliable voxelwise group analyses. Traditional template-based registration of the spinal cord uses intervertebral discs for alignment. However, substantial anatomical variability across individuals exists between vertebral and spinal levels. This study proposes a novel registration approach that leverages spinal nerve rootlets to improve alignment accuracy and reproducibility across individuals. We developed a registration method leveraging dorsal cervical rootlets segmentation and aligning them non-linearly with the PAM50 spinal cord template. Validation was performed on a multi-subject, multi-site dataset (n=267, 44 sites) and a multi-subject dataset with various neck positions (n=10, 3 sessions). We further validated the method on task-based functional MRI (n=23) to compare group-level activation maps using rootlet-based registration to traditional disc-based methods. Rootlet-based registration showed superior alignment across individuals compared to the traditional disc-based method. Notably, rootlet positions were more stable across neck positions. Group-level analysis of task-based functional MRI using rootlet-based increased Z scores and activation cluster size compared to disc-based registration (number of active voxels from 3292 to 7978). Rootlet-based registration enhances both inter- and intra-subject anatomical alignment and yields better spatial normalization for group-level fMRI analyses. Our findings highlight the potential of rootlet-based registration to improve the precision and reliability of spinal cord neuroimaging group analysis.

Title: Stereo X-ray tomography on deformed object tracking
Authors: Zhenduo Shang, Thomas Blumensath
Abstract: X-ray computed tomography is a powerful tool for volumetric imaging, but requires the collection of a large number of low-noise projection images, which is often too time consuming, limiting its applicability. In our previous work \cite{shang2023stereo}, we proposed a stereo X-ray tomography system to map the 3D position of fiducial markers using only two projections of a static volume. In dynamic imaging settings, where objects undergo deformations during imaging, this static method can be extended by utilizing additional temporal information. We thus extend the method to track the deformation of fiducial markers in 3D space, where we use knowledge of the initial object shape as prior information, improving the prediction of the evolution of its deformed state over time. In particular, knowledge of the initial object's stereo projections is shown to improve the method's robustness to noise when detecting fiducial marker locations in the projections of the deformed objects. Furthermore, after feature detection, by using the features' initial 3D position information in the undeformed object, we can also demonstrate improvements in the 3D mapping of the deformed features. Using a range of deformed 3D objects, this new approach is shown to be able to track fiducial markers in noisy stereo tomography images with subpixel accuracy.

Title: Efficient and robust 3D blind harmonization for large domain gaps
Authors: Hwihun Jeong, Hayeon Lee, Se Young Chun, Jongho Lee
Abstract: Blind harmonization has emerged as a promising technique for MR image harmonization to achieve scale-invariant representations, requiring only target domain data (i.e., no source domain data necessary). However, existing methods face limitations such as inter-slice heterogeneity in 3D, moderate image quality, and limited performance for a large domain gap. To address these challenges, we introduce BlindHarmonyDiff, a novel blind 3D harmonization framework that leverages an edge-to-image model tailored specifically to harmonization. Our framework employs a 3D rectified flow trained on target domain images to reconstruct the original image from an edge map, then yielding a harmonized image from the edge of a source domain image. We propose multi-stride patch training for efficient 3D training and a refinement module for robust inference by suppressing hallucination. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BlindHarmonyDiff outperforms prior arts by harmonizing diverse source domain images to the target domain, achieving higher correspondence to the target domain characteristics. Downstream task-based quality assessments such as tissue segmentation and age prediction on diverse MR scanners further confirm the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrate the capability of our robust and generalizable blind harmonization.

Title: Guidance and Control of Unmanned Surface Vehicles via HEOL
Authors: Loïck Degorre, Emmanuel Delaleau, Cédric Join, Michel Fliess
Abstract: This work presents a new approach to the guidance and control of marine craft via HEOL, i.e., a new way of combining flatness-based and model-free controllers. Its goal is to develop a general regulator for Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV). To do so, the well-known USV maneuvering model is simplified into a nominal Hovercraft model which is flat. A flatness-based controller is derived for the simplified USV model and the loop is closed via an intelligent proportional-derivative (iPD) regulator. We thus associate the well-documented natural robustness of flatness-based control and adaptivity of iPDs. The controller is applied in simulation to two surface vessels, one meeting the simplifying hypotheses, the other one being a generic USV of the literature. It is shown to stabilize both systems even in the presence of unmodeled environmental disturbances.

Title: Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS): Power Radiation Model and Optimal Beamforming Design
Authors: Xiaoxia Xu, Xidong Mu, Zhaolin Wang, Yuanwei Liu, Arumugam Nallanathan
Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems (PASS) improve wireless links by configuring the locations of activated pinching antennas along dielectric waveguides, namely pinching beamforming. In this paper, a novel adjustable power radiation model is proposed for PASS, where power radiation ratios of pinching antennas can be flexibly controlled by tuning the spacing between pinching antennas and waveguides. A closed-form pinching antenna spacing arrangement strategy is derived to achieve the commonly assumed equal-power radiation. Based on this, a practical PASS framework relying on discrete activation is considered, where pinching antennas can only be activated among a set of predefined locations. A transmit power minimization problem is formulated, which jointly optimizes the transmit beamforming, pinching beamforming, and the numbers of activated pinching antennas, subject to each user's minimum rate requirement. (1) To solve the resulting highly coupled mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, branch-and-bound (BnB)-based algorithms are proposed for both single-user and multi-user scenarios, which is guaranteed to converge to globally optimal solutions. (2) A low-complexity many-to-many matching algorithm is further developed. Combined with the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) theory, locally optimal and pairwise-stable solutions are obtained within polynomial-time complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that: (i) PASS significantly outperforms conventional multi-antenna architectures, particularly when the number of users and the spatial range increase; and (ii) The proposed matching-based algorithm achieves near-optimal performance, resulting in only a slight performance loss while significantly reducing computational overheads.

Title: Beyond Quadratic Costs in LQR: Bregman Divergence Control
Authors: Babak Hassibi, Joudi Hajar, Reza Ghane
Abstract: In the past couple of decades, the use of ``non-quadratic" convex cost functions has revolutionized signal processing, machine learning, and statistics, allowing one to customize solutions to have desired structures and properties. However, the situation is not the same in control where the use of quadratic costs still dominates, ostensibly because determining the ``value function", i.e., the optimal expected cost-to-go, which is critical to the construction of the optimal controller, becomes computationally intractable as soon as one considers general convex costs. As a result, practitioners often resort to heuristics and approximations, such as model predictive control that only looks a few steps into the future. In the quadratic case, the value function is easily determined by solving Riccati equations. In this work, we consider a special class of convex cost functions constructed from Bregman divergence and show how, with appropriate choices, they can be used to fully extend the framework developed for the quadratic case. The resulting optimal controllers are infinite horizon, come with stability guarantees, and have state-feedback, or estimated state-feedback, laws. They exhibit a much wider range of behavior than their quadratic counterparts since the feedback laws are nonlinear. The approach can be applied to several cases of interest, including safety control, sparse control, and bang-bang control.

Title: Beyond Quadratic Costs: A Bregman Divergence Approach to H$_\infty$ Control
Authors: Joudi Hajar, Reza Ghane, Babak Hassibi
Abstract: This paper presents a novel extension of the H$_\infty$ control framework that generalizes the traditional quadratic cost formulation to accommodate strictly convex, nonquadratic functions for the state, control input, and disturbance. This new formulation not only captures additional noise characteristics but also supports a range of performance objectives-including sparse control, safety constraints, and other tailored behaviors-beyond what is possible with quadratic costs. We derive a closed-form solution of a central controller that minimizes the worst-case performance ratio under the proposed cost structure. Furthermore, we develop Riccati-like equations that impose necessary and sufficient conditions on the nonquadratic cost functions, thereby ensuring the existence of a robust solution. Finally, we rigorously establish Lyapunov stability for the closed-loop system. The proposed framework bridges robust control theory with modern approaches in machine learning and signal processing, offering enhanced flexibility and improved performance in complex control scenarios.

Title: Recursive Algorithms for Sparse Parameter Identification of Multivariate Stochastic Systems with Non-stationary Observations
Authors: Yanxin Fu, Wenxiao Zhao
Abstract: The classical sparse parameter identification methods are usually based on the iterative basis selection such as greedy algorithms, or the numerical optimization of regularized cost functions such as LASSO and Bayesian posterior probability distribution, etc., which, however, are not suitable for online sparsity inference when data arrive sequentially. This paper presents recursive algorithms for sparse parameter identification of multivariate stochastic systems with non-stationary observations. First, a new bivariate criterion function is presented by introducing an auxiliary variable matrix into a weighted $L_1$ regularization criterion. The new criterion function is subsequently decomposed into two solvable subproblems via alternating optimization of the two variable matrices, for which the optimizers can be explicitly formulated into recursive equations. Second, under the non-stationary and non-persistent excitation conditions on the systems, theoretical properties of the recursive algorithms are established. That is, the estimates are proved to be with (i) set convergence, i.e., the accurate estimation of the sparse index set of the unknown parameter matrix, and (ii) parameter convergence, i.e., the consistent estimation for values of the non-zero elements of the unknown parameter matrix. Finally, numerical examples are given to support the theoretical analysis.

Title: Towards Lightweight Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution with Depthwise Separable Dilated Convolutional Network
Authors: Usman Muhammad, Jorma Laaksonen, Lyudmila Mihaylova
Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated highly competitive performance in super-resolution (SR) for natural images by learning mappings from low-resolution (LR) to high-resolution (HR) images. However, hyperspectral super-resolution remains an ill-posed problem due to the high spectral dimensionality of the data and the scarcity of available training samples. Moreover, existing methods often rely on large models with a high number of parameters or require the fusion with panchromatic or RGB images, both of which are often impractical in real-world scenarios. Inspired by the MobileNet architecture, we introduce a lightweight depthwise separable dilated convolutional network (DSDCN) to address the aforementioned challenges. Specifically, our model leverages multiple depthwise separable convolutions, similar to the MobileNet architecture, and further incorporates a dilated convolution fusion block to make the model more flexible for the extraction of both spatial and spectral features. In addition, we propose a custom loss function that combines mean squared error (MSE), an L2 norm regularization-based constraint, and a spectral angle-based loss, ensuring the preservation of both spectral and spatial details. The proposed model achieves very competitive performance on two publicly available hyperspectral datasets, making it well-suited for hyperspectral image super-resolution tasks.

Title: Stealth Signals: Multi-Discriminator GANs for Covert Communications Against Diverse Wardens
Authors: Afan Ali, Md. Jalil Piran, Huseyin Arslan
Abstract: Covert wireless communications are critical for concealing the existence of any transmission from adversarial wardens, particularly in complex environments with multiple heterogeneous detectors. This paper proposes a novel adversarial AI framework leveraging a multi-discriminator Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to design signals that evade detection by diverse wardens, while ensuring reliable decoding by the intended receiver. The transmitter is modeled as a generator that produces noise-like signals, while every warden is modeled as an individual discriminator, suggesting varied channel conditions and detection techniques. Unlike traditional methods like spread spectrum or single-discriminator GANs, our approach addresses multi-warden scenarios with moving receiver and wardens, which enhances robustness in urban surveillance, military operations, and 6G networks. Performance evaluation shows encouraging results with improved detection probabilities and bit error rates (BERs), in up to five warden cases, compared to noise injection and single-discriminator baselines. The scalability and flexibility of the system make it a potential candidate for future wireless secure systems, and potential future directions include real-time optimization and synergy with 6G technologies such as intelligent reflecting surfaces.

Title: Perceptual Implications of Automatic Anonymization in Pathological Speech
Authors: Soroosh Tayebi Arasteh, Saba Afza, Tri-Thien Nguyen, Lukas Buess, Maryam Parvin, Tomas Arias-Vergara, Paula Andrea Perez-Toro, Hiu Ching Hung, Mahshad Lotfinia, Thomas Gorges, Elmar Noeth, Maria Schuster, Seung Hee Yang, Andreas Maier
Abstract: Automatic anonymization techniques are essential for ethical sharing of pathological speech data, yet their perceptual consequences remain understudied. This study presents the first comprehensive human-centered analysis of anonymized pathological speech, using a structured perceptual protocol involving ten native and non-native German listeners with diverse linguistic, clinical, and technical backgrounds. Listeners evaluated anonymized-original utterance pairs from 180 speakers spanning Cleft Lip and Palate, Dysarthria, Dysglossia, Dysphonia, and age-matched healthy controls. Speech was anonymized using state-of-the-art automatic methods (equal error rates in the range of 30-40%). Listeners completed Turing-style discrimination and quality rating tasks under zero-shot (single-exposure) and few-shot (repeated-exposure) conditions. Discrimination accuracy was high overall (91% zero-shot; 93% few-shot), but varied by disorder (repeated-measures ANOVA: p=0.007), ranging from 96% (Dysarthria) to 86% (Dysphonia). Anonymization consistently reduced perceived quality (from 83% to 59%, p<0.001), with pathology-specific degradation patterns (one-way ANOVA: p=0.005). Native listeners rated original speech slightly higher than non-native listeners (Delta=4%, p=0.199), but this difference nearly disappeared after anonymization (Delta=1%, p=0.724). No significant gender-based bias was observed. Critically, human perceptual outcomes did not correlate with automatic privacy or clinical utility metrics. These results underscore the need for listener-informed, disorder- and context-specific anonymization strategies that preserve privacy while maintaining interpretability, communicative functions, and diagnostic utility, especially for vulnerable populations such as children.

Title: Over-the-Air Inference over Multi-hop MIMO Networks
Authors: Chenghong Bian, Meng Hua, Deniz Gunduz
Abstract: A novel over-the-air machine learning framework over multi-hop multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) networks is proposed. The core idea is to imitate fully connected (FC) neural network layers using multiple MIMO channels by carefully designing the precoding matrices at the transmitting nodes. A neural network dubbed PrototypeNet is employed consisting of multiple FC layers, with the number of neurons of each layer equal to the number of antennas of the corresponding terminal. To achieve satisfactory performance, we train PrototypeNet based on a customized loss function consisting of classification error and the power of latent vectors to satisfy transmit power constraints, with noise injection during training. Precoding matrices for each hop are then obtained by solving an optimization problem. We also propose a multiple-block extension when the number of antennas is limited. Numerical results verify that the proposed over-the-air transmission scheme can achieve satisfactory classification accuracy under a power constraint. The results also show that higher classification accuracy can be achieved with an increasing number of hops at a modest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Title: A Temporal Broadening-Aware Pulse Width Adaptation Scheme for ISI Mitigation and Energy Efficiency in THz Communication
Authors: Ahmed Naeem, Saira Rafique, Abuu B. Kihero, Huseyin Arslan
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communication ensures the provision of ultra-high data rates owing to its abundant bandwidth; however, its performance is impeded by complex propagation mechanisms. In particular, molecular absorption induces a temporal broadening effect (TBE), which causes pulse spreading and inter-symbol interference (ISI), especially in ON-OFF keying-based systems. To address this, we propose an adaptive pulse-width transmission scheme that dynamically adjusts pulse durations based on the anticipated TBE. This approach suppresses ISI by confining energy within symbol durations while also exploiting TBE constructively to reduce pulse transmissions in specific bit patterns, leading to improved energy efficiency (EE) as an additional advantage of the proposed scheme. Analytical derivations and simulation results confirm that the proposed scheme substantially improves EE and bit error rate under practical THz channel conditions.

Authors: Julian Christopher L. Maya, Johnenn R. Manalang, Maricor N. Soriano
Abstract: CorStitch is an open-source software developed to automate the creation of accurate georeferenced reef mosaics from video transects obtained through Automated Rapid Reef Assessment System surveys. We utilized a Fourier-based image correlation algorithm to stitch sequential video frames, aligning them with synchronized GNSS timestamps. The resulting compressed Keyhole Markup Language files, compatible with geographic information systems such as Google Earth, enable detailed spatial analysis. Validation through comparative analysis of mosaics from two temporally distinct surveys of the same reef demonstrated the software's consistent and reliable performance.

Title: Stabilization by Controllers Having Integer Coefficients
Authors: Joowon Lee, Donggil Lee, Junsoo Kim
Abstract: The system property of ``having integer coefficients,'' that is, a transfer function has an integer monic polynomial as its denominator, is significant in the field of encrypted control as it is required for a dynamic controller to be realized over encrypted data. This paper shows that there always exists a controller with integer coefficients stabilizing a given discrete-time linear time-invariant plant. A constructive algorithm to obtain such a controller is provided, along with numerical examples. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to converting a pre-designed controller to have integer coefficients, while the original performance is preserved in the sense that the transfer function of the closed-loop system remains unchanged.

Title: Linear Phase Balancing Scheme using Voltage Unbalance Sensitivities in Multi-phase Power Distribution Grids
Authors: Rahul K. Gupta
Abstract: Power distribution networks, especially in North America, are often unbalanced due to the mix of single-, two- and three-phase networks as well as due to the high penetration of single-phase devices at the distribution level such as electric vehicle (EV) chargers and single-phase solar plants. However, the network operator must adhere to the voltage unbalance levels within the limits specified by IEEE, IEC, and NEMA standards for the safety of the equipment as well as the efficiency of the network operation. Existing works have proposed active and reactive power control in the network to minimize imbalances. However, these optimization problems are highly nonlinear and nonconvex due to the inherent non-linearity of unbalanced metrics and power-flow equations. In this work, we propose a linearization approach of unbalance metrics such as voltage unbalance factors (VUF), phase voltage unbalance rate (PVUR), and line voltage unbalance rate (LVUR) using the first order Taylor's approximation. This linearization is then applied to the phase balancing control scheme; it is formulated as a feedback approach where the linearization is updated successively after the active/reactive control setpoint has been actuated and shows improvement in voltage imbalances. We demonstrate the application of the proposed scheme on a standard IEEE benchmark test case, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Title: A Methodological and Structural Review of Parkinsons Disease Detection Across Diverse Data Modalities
Authors: Abu Saleh Musa Miah, taro Suzuki, Jungpil Shin
Abstract: Parkinsons Disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily affects motor functions and can lead to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia in its advanced stages. With approximately 10 million people diagnosed globally 1 to 1.8 per 1,000 individuals, according to reports by the Japan Times and the Parkinson Foundation early and accurate diagnosis of PD is crucial for improving patient outcomes. While numerous studies have utilized machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for PD recognition, existing surveys are limited in scope, often focusing on single data modalities and failing to capture the potential of multimodal approaches. To address these gaps, this study presents a comprehensive review of PD recognition systems across diverse data modalities, including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), gait-based pose analysis, gait sensory data, handwriting analysis, speech test data, Electroencephalography (EEG), and multimodal fusion techniques. Based on over 347 articles from leading scientific databases, this review examines key aspects such as data collection methods, settings, feature representations, and system performance, with a focus on recognition accuracy and robustness. This survey aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers, providing actionable guidance for the development of next generation PD recognition systems. By leveraging diverse data modalities and cutting-edge machine learning paradigms, this work contributes to advancing the state of PD diagnostics and improving patient care through innovative, multimodal approaches.

Title: Secure Multi-Hop Relaying in Large-Scale Space-Air-Ground-Sea Integrated Networks
Authors: Hyeonsu Lyu, Hyeonho Noh, Hyun Jong Yang, Kaushik Chowdhury
Abstract: As a key enabler of borderless and ubiquitous connectivity, space-air-ground-sea integrated networks (SAGSINs) are expected to be a cornerstone of 6G wireless communications. However, the multi-tiered and global-scale nature of SAGSINs also amplifies the security vulnerabilities, particularly due to the hidden, passive eavesdroppers distributed throughout the network. In this paper, we introduce a joint optimization framework for multi-hop relaying in SAGSINs that maximizes the minimum user throughput while ensuring a minimum strictly positive secure connection (SPSC) probability. We first derive a closed-form expression for the SPSC probability and incorporate this into a cross-layer optimization framework that jointly optimizes radio resources and relay routes. Specifically, we propose an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ optimal frequency allocation and power splitting strategy-dividing power levels of data transmission and cooperative jamming. We then introduce a Monte-Carlo relay routing algorithm that closely approaches the performance of the numerical upper-bound method. We validate our framework on testbeds built with real-world dataset. All source code and data for reproducing the numerical experiments will be open-sourced.

Title: AI-Driven High-Resolution Cell Segmentation and Quantitative Analysis
Authors: Shuang Zhang, Carleton Coffin, Karyn L. Rogers, Catherine Ann Royer, Ge Wang
Abstract: Studying the growth and metabolism of microbes provides critical insights into their evolutionary adaptations to harsh environments, which are essential for microbial research and biotechnology applications. In this study, we developed an AI-driven image analysis system to efficiently segment individual cells and quantitatively analyze key cellular features. This system is comprised of four main modules. First, a denoising algorithm enhances contrast and suppresses noise while preserving fine cellular details. Second, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) enables accurate, zero-shot segmentation of cells without additional training. Third, post-processing is applied to refine segmentation results by removing over-segmented masks. Finally, quantitative analysis algorithms extract essential cellular features, including average intensity, length, width, and volume. The results show that denoising and post-processing significantly improved the segmentation accuracy of SAM in this new domain. Without human annotations, the AI-driven pipeline automatically and efficiently outlines cellular boundaries, indexes them, and calculates key cellular parameters with high accuracy. This framework will enable efficient and automated quantitative analysis of high-resolution fluorescence microscopy images to advance research into microbial adaptations to grow and metabolism that allow extremophiles to thrive in their harsh habitats.

Title: Dimension-reduced Optimization of Multi-zone Thermostatically Controlled Loads
Authors: Xueyuan Cui, Yi Wang, Bolun Xu
Abstract: This study proposes a computationally efficient method for optimizing multi-zone thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) by leveraging dimensionality reduction through an auto-encoder. We develop a multi-task learning framework to jointly represent latent variables and formulate a state-space model based on observed TCL operation data. This significantly reduces the dimensionality of TCL variables and states while preserving critical nonlinear interdependencies in TCL control. To address various application scenarios, we introduce optimization algorithms based on system identification (OptIden) and system simulation (OptSim) tailored to the latent variable representation. These approaches employ automatic differentiation and zeroth-order techniques, respectively, for efficient implementation. We evaluate the proposed method using a 90-zone apartment prototype, comparing its performance to traditional high-dimensional optimization. Results demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces control costs while achieving significantly higher computational efficiency.

Title: Deep Learning Assisted Outer Volume Removal for Highly-Accelerated Real-Time Dynamic MRI
Authors: Merve Gülle, Sebastian Weingärtner, Mehmet Akçakaya
Abstract: Real-time (RT) dynamic MRI plays a vital role in capturing rapid physiological processes, offering unique insights into organ motion and function. Among these applications, RT cine MRI is particularly important for functional assessment of the heart with high temporal resolution. RT imaging enables free-breathing, ungated imaging of cardiac motion, making it a crucial alternative for patients who cannot tolerate conventional breath-hold, ECG-gated acquisitions. However, achieving high acceleration rates in RT cine MRI is challenging due to aliasing artifacts from extra-cardiac tissues, particularly at high undersampling factors. In this study, we propose a novel outer volume removal (OVR) method to address this challenge by eliminating aliasing contributions from non-cardiac regions in a post-processing framework. Our approach estimates the outer volume signal for each timeframe using composite temporal images from time-interleaved undersampling patterns, which inherently contain pseudo-periodic ghosting artifacts. A deep learning (DL) model is trained to identify and remove these artifacts, producing a clean outer volume estimate that is subsequently subtracted from the corresponding k-space data. The final reconstruction is performed with a physics-driven DL (PD-DL) method trained using an OVR-specific loss function to restore high spatio-temporal resolution images. Experimental results show that the proposed method at high accelerations achieves image quality that is visually comparable to clinical baseline images, while outperforming conventional reconstruction techniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The proposed approach provides a practical and effective solution for artifact reduction in RT cine MRI without requiring acquisition modifications, offering a pathway to higher acceleration rates while preserving diagnostic quality.

Title: Spreading Depolarization Detection in Electrocorticogram Spectrogram Imaging by Deep Learning: Is It Just About Delta Band?
Authors: Jeanne Boyer-Chammard, Yinzhe Wu, Chenyu Zhang, Sharon Jewell, Anthony Strong, Guang Yang, Martyn Boutelle
Abstract: Prevention of secondary brain injury is a core aim of neurocritical care, with Spreading Depolarizations (SDs) recognized as a significant independent cause. SDs are typically monitored through invasive, high-frequency electrocorticography (ECoG); however, detection remains challenging due to signal artifacts that obscure critical SD-related electrophysiological changes, such as power attenuation and DC drifting. Recent studies suggest spectrogram analysis could improve SD detection; however, brain injury patients often show power reduction across all bands except delta, causing class imbalance. Previous methods focusing solely on delta mitigates imbalance but overlooks features in other frequencies, limiting detection performance. This study explores using multi-frequency spectrogram analysis, revealing that essential SD-related features span multiple frequency bands beyond the most active delta band. This study demonstrated that further integration of both alpha and delta bands could result in enhanced SD detection accuracy by a deep learning model.

Title: Linear Parameter Varying Attitude Control For CubeSats Using Electrospray Thrusters
Authors: Felix Biertümpfel, Emily Burgin, Hanna-Lee Harjono, Paulo Lozano, Harald Pfifer
Abstract: This paper proposes the design of a single linear parameter-varying (LPV) controller for the attitude control of CubeSats using electro spray thrusters. CubeSat attitude control based on electro spray thrusters faces two main challenges. Firstly, the thruster can only generate a small control torque leading to easily saturating the actuation system. Secondly, CubeSats need to operate multiple different maneuvers from large to small slews to pointing tasks. LPV control is ideally suitable to address these challenges. The proposed design follows a mixed-sensitivity control scheme. The parameter-varying weights depend on the attitude error and are derived from the performance and robustness requirements of individual typical CubeSat maneuvers. The controller is synthesized by minimizing the induced L2-norm of the closed-loop interconnections between the controller and weighted plant. The performance and robustness of the controller is demonstrated on a simulation of the MIT Space Propulsion Lab's Magnetic Levitation CubeSat Testbed.

Title: GuideSR: Rethinking Guidance for One-Step High-Fidelity Diffusion-Based Super-Resolution
Authors: Aditya Arora, Zhengzhong Tu, Yufei Wang, Ruizheng Bai, Jian Wang, Sizhuo Ma
Abstract: In this paper, we propose GuideSR, a novel single-step diffusion-based image super-resolution (SR) model specifically designed to enhance image fidelity. Existing diffusion-based SR approaches typically adapt pre-trained generative models to image restoration tasks by adding extra conditioning on a VAE-downsampled representation of the degraded input, which often compromises structural fidelity. GuideSR addresses this limitation by introducing a dual-branch architecture comprising: (1) a Guidance Branch that preserves high-fidelity structures from the original-resolution degraded input, and (2) a Diffusion Branch, which a pre-trained latent diffusion model to enhance perceptual quality. Unlike conventional conditioning mechanisms, our Guidance Branch features a tailored structure for image restoration tasks, combining Full Resolution Blocks (FRBs) with channel attention and an Image Guidance Network (IGN) with guided attention. By embedding detailed structural information directly into the restoration pipeline, GuideSR produces sharper and more visually consistent results. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GuideSR achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining the low computational cost of single-step approaches, with up to 1.39dB PSNR gain on challenging real-world datasets. Our approach consistently outperforms existing methods across various reference-based metrics including PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, DISTS and FID, further representing a practical advancement for real-world image restoration.

Title: BERSting at the Screams: A Benchmark for Distanced, Emotional and Shouted Speech Recognition
Authors: Paige Tuttösí, Mantaj Dhillon, Luna Sang, Shane Eastwood, Poorvi Bhatia, Quang Minh Dinh, Avni Kapoor, Yewon Jin, Angelica Lim
Abstract: Some speech recognition tasks, such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), are approaching or have reached human performance in many reported metrics. Yet, they continue to struggle in complex, real-world, situations, such as with distanced speech. Previous challenges have released datasets to address the issue of distanced ASR, however, the focus remains primarily on distance, specifically relying on multi-microphone array systems. Here we present the B(asic) E(motion) R(andom phrase) S(hou)t(s) (BERSt) dataset. The dataset contains almost 4 hours of English speech from 98 actors with varying regional and non-native accents. The data was collected on smartphones in the actors homes and therefore includes at least 98 different acoustic environments. The data also includes 7 different emotion prompts and both shouted and spoken utterances. The smartphones were places in 19 different positions, including obstructions and being in a different room than the actor. This data is publicly available for use and can be used to evaluate a variety of speech recognition tasks, including: ASR, shout detection, and speech emotion recognition (SER). We provide initial benchmarks for ASR and SER tasks, and find that ASR degrades both with an increase in distance and shout level and shows varied performance depending on the intended emotion. Our results show that the BERSt dataset is challenging for both ASR and SER tasks and continued work is needed to improve the robustness of such systems for more accurate real-world use.

Title: Characterizing gaussian mixture of motion modes for skid-steer state estimation
Authors: Ameya Salvi, Mark Brudnak, Jonathon M. Smereka, Matthias Schmid, Venkat Krovi
Abstract: Skid-steered wheel mobile robots (SSWMRs) are characterized by the unique domination of the tire-terrain skidding for the robot to move. The lack of reliable friction models cascade into unreliable motion models, especially the reduced ordered variants used for state estimation and robot control. Ensemble modeling is an emerging research direction where the overall motion model is broken down into a family of local models to distribute the performance and resource requirement and provide a fast real-time prediction. To this end, a gaussian mixture model based modeling identification of model clusters is adopted and implemented within an interactive multiple model (IMM) based state estimation. The framework is adopted and implemented for angular velocity as the estimated state for a mid scaled skid-steered wheel mobile robot platform.

Title: Generative Machine Learning in Adaptive Control of Dynamic Manufacturing Processes: A Review
Authors: Suk Ki Lee, Hyunwoong Ko
Abstract: Dynamic manufacturing processes exhibit complex characteristics defined by time-varying parameters, nonlinear behaviors, and uncertainties. These characteristics require sophisticated in-situ monitoring techniques utilizing multimodal sensor data and adaptive control systems that can respond to real-time feedback while maintaining product quality. Recently, generative machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling complex distributions and generating synthetic data while handling these manufacturing uncertainties. However, adopting these generative technologies in dynamic manufacturing systems lacks a functional control-oriented perspective to translate their probabilistic understanding into actionable process controls while respecting constraints. This review presents a functional classification of Prediction-Based, Direct Policy, Quality Inference, and Knowledge-Integrated approaches, offering a perspective for understanding existing ML-enhanced control systems and incorporating generative ML. The analysis of generative ML architectures within this framework demonstrates control-relevant properties and potential to extend current ML-enhanced approaches where conventional methods prove insufficient. We show generative ML's potential for manufacturing control through decision-making applications, process guidance, simulation, and digital twins, while identifying critical research gaps: separation between generation and control functions, insufficient physical understanding of manufacturing phenomena, and challenges adapting models from other domains. To address these challenges, we propose future research directions aimed at developing integrated frameworks that combine generative ML and control technologies to address the dynamic complexities of modern manufacturing systems.

Title: Future-Oriented Navigation: Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance with One-Shot Energy-Based Multimodal Motion Prediction
Authors: Ze Zhang, Georg Hess, Junjie Hu, Emmanuel Dean, Lennart Svensson, Knut Åkesson
Abstract: This paper proposes an integrated approach for the safe and efficient control of mobile robots in dynamic and uncertain environments. The approach consists of two key steps: one-shot multimodal motion prediction to anticipate motions of dynamic obstacles and model predictive control to incorporate these predictions into the motion planning process. Motion prediction is driven by an energy-based neural network that generates high-resolution, multi-step predictions in a single operation. The prediction outcomes are further utilized to create geometric shapes formulated as mathematical constraints. Instead of treating each dynamic obstacle individually, predicted obstacles are grouped by proximity in an unsupervised way to improve performance and efficiency. The overall collision-free navigation is handled by model predictive control with a specific design for proactive dynamic obstacle avoidance. The proposed approach allows mobile robots to navigate effectively in dynamic environments. Its performance is accessed across various scenarios that represent typical warehouse settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms other existing dynamic obstacle avoidance methods.

Title: Field-scale soil moisture estimated from Sentinel-1 SAR data using a knowledge-guided deep learning approach
Authors: Yi Yu, Patrick Filippi, Thomas F. A. Bishop
Abstract: Soil moisture (SM) estimation from active microwave data remains challenging due to the complex interactions between radar backscatter and surface characteristics. While the water cloud model (WCM) provides a semi-physical approach for understanding these interactions, its empirical component often limits performance across diverse agricultural landscapes. This research presents preliminary efforts for developing a knowledge-guided deep learning approach, which integrates WCM principles into a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, to estimate field SM using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. Our proposed approach leverages LSTM's capacity to capture spatiotemporal dependencies while maintaining physical consistency through a modified dual-component loss function, including a WCM-based semi-physical component and a boundary condition regularisation. The proposed approach is built upon the soil backscatter coefficients isolated from the total backscatter, together with Landsat-resolution vegetation information and surface characteristics. A four-fold spatial cross-validation was performed against in-situ SM data to assess the model performance. Results showed the proposed approach reduced SM retrieval uncertainties by 0.02 m$^3$/m$^3$ and achieved correlation coefficients (R) of up to 0.64 in areas with varying vegetation cover and surface conditions, demonstrating the potential to address the over-simplification in WCM.

Title: Conformal changepoint localization
Authors: Sanjit Dandapanthula, Aaditya Ramdas
Abstract: Changepoint localization is the problem of estimating the index at which a change occurred in the data generating distribution of an ordered list of data, or declaring that no change occurred. We present the broadly applicable CONCH (CONformal CHangepoint localization) algorithm, which uses a matrix of conformal p-values to produce a confidence interval for a (single) changepoint under the mild assumption that the pre-change and post-change distributions are each exchangeable. We exemplify the CONCH algorithm on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets, including using black-box pre-trained classifiers to detect changes in sequences of images or text.

Title: Edge Large AI Models: Revolutionizing 6G Networks
Authors: Zixin Wang, Yuanming Shi, Yong Zhou, Jingyang Zhu, Khaled. B. Letaief
Abstract: Large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) possess human-like abilities to solve a wide range of real-world problems, exemplifying the potential of experts in various domains and modalities. By leveraging the communication and computation capabilities of geographically dispersed edge devices, edge LAM emerges as an enabling technology to empower the delivery of various real-time intelligent services in 6G. Unlike traditional edge artificial intelligence (AI) that primarily supports a single task using small models, edge LAM is featured by the need of the decomposition and distributed deployment of large models, and the ability to support highly generalized and diverse tasks. However, due to limited communication, computation, and storage resources over wireless networks, the vast number of trainable neurons and the substantial communication overhead pose a formidable hurdle to the practical deployment of edge LAMs. In this paper, we investigate the opportunities and challenges of edge LAMs from the perspectives of model decomposition and resource management. Specifically, we propose collaborative fine-tuning and full-parameter training frameworks, alongside a microservice-assisted inference architecture, to enhance the deployment of edge LAM over wireless networks. Additionally, we investigate the application of edge LAM in air-interface designs, focusing on channel prediction and beamforming. These innovative frameworks and applications offer valuable insights and solutions for advancing 6G technology.

Title: Optimal Vector Compressed Sensing Using James Stein Shrinkage
Authors: Apratim Dey, David Donoho
Abstract: The trend in modern science and technology is to take vector measurements rather than scalars, ruthlessly scaling to ever higher dimensional vectors. For about two decades now, traditional scalar Compressed Sensing has been synonymous with a Convex Optimization based procedure called Basis Pursuit. In the vector recovery case, the natural tendency is to return to a straightforward vector extension of Basis Pursuit, also based on Convex Optimization. However, Convex Optimization is provably suboptimal, particularly when $B$ is large. In this paper, we propose SteinSense, a lightweight iterative algorithm, which is provably optimal when $B$ is large. It does not have any tuning parameter, does not need any training data, requires zero knowledge of sparsity, is embarrassingly simple to implement, and all of this makes it easily scalable to high vector dimensions. We conduct a massive volume of both real and synthetic experiments that confirm the efficacy of SteinSense, and also provide theoretical justification based on ideas from Approximate Message Passing. Fascinatingly, we discover that SteinSense is quite robust, delivering the same quality of performance on real data, and even under substantial departures from conditions under which existing theory holds.

Title: Communication-Efficient Wireless Federated Fine-Tuning for Large-Scale AI Models
Authors: Bumjun Kim, Wan Choi
Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various tasks. Yet, fine-tuning such massive models in federated learning (FL) settings poses significant challenges due to resource constraints and communication overhead. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) addresses these issues by training compact, low-rank matrices instead of fully fine-tuning large models. This paper introduces a wireless federated LoRA fine-tuning framework that optimizes both learning performance and communication efficiency. We provide a novel convergence analysis, revealing how LoRA rank and covariance effects influence FL training dynamics. Leveraging these insights, we propose Sparsified Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (\textbf{SOFT}), an adaptive sparsification method that streamlines parameter updates without expensive matrix multiplications and singular value decomposition (SVD) operations. Additionally, we present a Two Stage Federated Algorithm (\textbf{TSFA}) algorithm that pre-determines key parameters offline and dynamically adjusts bandwidth and sparsification online, ensuring efficient training under latency constraints. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach achieves accuracy comparable to ideal scenario models while significantly reducing communication overhead. Our framework thus enables scalable, resource-efficient deployment of large models in real-world wireless FL scenarios.

Title: Multi-segment Soft Robot Control via Deep Koopman-based Model Predictive Control
Authors: Lei Lv, Lei Liu, Lei Bao, Fuchun Sun, Jiahong Dong, Jianwei Zhang, Xuemei Shan, Kai Sun, Hao Huang, Yu Luo
Abstract: Soft robots, compared to regular rigid robots, as their multiple segments with soft materials bring flexibility and compliance, have the advantages of safe interaction and dexterous operation in the environment. However, due to its characteristics of high dimensional, nonlinearity, time-varying nature, and infinite degree of freedom, it has been challenges in achieving precise and dynamic control such as trajectory tracking and position reaching. To address these challenges, we propose a framework of Deep Koopman-based Model Predictive Control (DK-MPC) for handling multi-segment soft robots. We first employ a deep learning approach with sampling data to approximate the Koopman operator, which therefore linearizes the high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics of the soft robots into a finite-dimensional linear representation. Secondly, this linearized model is utilized within a model predictive control framework to compute optimal control inputs that minimize the tracking error between the desired and actual state trajectories. The real-world experiments on the soft robot "Chordata" demonstrate that DK-MPC could achieve high-precision control, showing the potential of DK-MPC for future applications to soft robots.

Title: Decentralised, Self-Organising Drone Swarms using Coupled Oscillators
Authors: Kevin Quinn, Cormac Molloy, Harun Šiljak
Abstract: The problem of robotic synchronisation and coordination is a long-standing one. Combining autonomous, computerised systems with unpredictable real-world conditions can have consequences ranging from poor performance to collisions and damage. This paper proposes using coupled oscillators to create a drone swarm that is decentralised and self organising. This allows for greater flexibility and adaptiveness than a hard-coded swarm, with more resilience and scalability than a centralised system. Our method allows for a variable number of drones to spontaneously form a swarm and react to changing swarm conditions. Additionally, this method includes provisions to prevent communication interference between drones, and signal processing techniques to ensure a smooth and cohesive swarm.

Title: Emergence of Roles in Robotic Teams with Model Sharing and Limited Communication
Authors: Ian O'Flynn, Harun Šiljak
Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning strategy for use in multi-agent foraging systems in which the learning is centralised to a single agent and its model is periodically disseminated among the population of non-learning agents. In a domain where multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is the common approach, this approach aims to significantly reduce the computational and energy demands compared to approaches such as MARL and centralised learning models. By developing high performing foraging agents, these approaches can be translated into real-world applications such as logistics, environmental monitoring, and autonomous exploration. A reward function was incorporated into this approach that promotes role development among agents, without explicit directives. This led to the differentiation of behaviours among the agents. The implicit encouragement of role differentiation allows for dynamic actions in which agents can alter roles dependent on their interactions with the environment without the need for explicit communication between agents.

Title: Sum Rate Maximization for NOMA-Assisted Uplink Pinching-Antenna Systems
Authors: Ming Zeng, Ji Wang, Xingwang Li, Gongpu Wang, Octavia A. Dobre, Zhiguo Ding
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an uplink communication scenario in which multiple users communicate with an access point (AP) employing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). A pinching antenna, which can be activated at an arbitrary point along a dielectric waveguide, is deployed at the AP to dynamically reconfigure user channels. The objective is to maximize the system sum rate by jointly optimizing the pinching-antenna's position and the users' transmit powers. The formulated optimization problem is non-convex, and addressed using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. For performance benchmarking, two time division multiple access (TDMA) schemes are considered: one based on the pinching antenna individually activated for each user, and the other based on the single-pinching-antenna configuration serving all users. Numerical results demonstrate that the use of the pinching antenna significantly enhances the system sum rate compared to conventional antenna architectures. Moreover, the NOMA-based scheme outperforms the TDMA-based scheme with a single pinching antenna but is outperformed by the TDMA-based approach when the pinching antenna is adaptively configured for each user. Finally, the proposed PSO-based method is shown to achieve near-optimal performance for both NOMA and TDMA with a common pinching-antenna configuration.

Title: Synthesizing and Identifying Noise Levels in Autonomous Vehicle Camera Radar Datasets
Authors: Mathis Morales, Golnaz Habibi
Abstract: Detecting and tracking objects is a crucial component of any autonomous navigation method. For the past decades, object detection has yielded promising results using neural networks on various datasets. While many methods focus on performance metrics, few projects focus on improving the robustness of these detection and tracking pipelines, notably to sensor failures. In this paper we attempt to address this issue by creating a realistic synthetic data augmentation pipeline for camera-radar Autonomous Vehicle (AV) datasets. Our goal is to accurately simulate sensor failures and data deterioration due to real-world interferences. We also present our results of a baseline lightweight Noise Recognition neural network trained and tested on our augmented dataset, reaching an overall recognition accuracy of 54.4\% on 11 categories across 10086 images and 2145 radar point-clouds.

Title: Neural Network Verification for Gliding Drone Control: A Case Study
Authors: Colin Kessler, Ekaterina Komendantskaya, Marco Casadio, Ignazio Maria Viola, Thomas Flinkow, Albaraa Ammar Othman, Alistair Malhotra, Robbie McPherson
Abstract: As machine learning is increasingly deployed in autonomous systems, verification of neural network controllers is becoming an active research domain. Existing tools and annual verification competitions suggest that soon this technology will become effective for real-world applications. Our application comes from the emerging field of microflyers that are passively transported by the wind, which may have various uses in weather or pollution monitoring. Specifically, we investigate centimetre-scale bio-inspired gliding drones that resemble Alsomitra macrocarpa diaspores. In this paper, we propose a new case study on verifying Alsomitra-inspired drones with neural network controllers, with the aim of adhering closely to a target trajectory. We show that our system differs substantially from existing VNN and ARCH competition benchmarks, and show that a combination of tools holds promise for verifying such systems in the future, if certain shortcomings can be overcome. We propose a novel method for robust training of regression networks, and investigate formalisations of this case study in Vehicle and CORA. Our verification results suggest that the investigated training methods do improve performance and robustness of neural network controllers in this application, but are limited in scope and usefulness. This is due to systematic limitations of both Vehicle and CORA, and the complexity of our system reducing the scale of reachability, which we investigate in detail. If these limitations can be overcome, it will enable engineers to develop safe and robust technologies that improve people's lives and reduce our impact on the environment.

Title: RIS Partitioning and User Clustering for Resilient Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access UAV Networks
Authors: Mohammed Saif, Shahrokh Valaee
Abstract: The integration of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has emerged as a promising solution for enhancing connectivity in future wireless networks. This paper designs well-connected and resilient UAV networks by deploying and virtually partitioning multiple RISs to create multiple RIS-aided links, focusing on a link-layer perspective. The RIS-aided links are created to connect user equipment (UE) to blocked and reliable UAVs, where multiple UEs can transmit to same UAV via RIS using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), granting access to UEs and maximizing network connectivity. We first derive exact and approximated closed-form expressions for signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) based on aligned and non-aligned RIS-aided beams. Then, we propose to formulate the problem of maximizing network connectivity that jointly considers (i) UE NOMA clustering, (ii) RIS-aided link selection, and (ii) virtual RIS partitioning. This problem is a computationally expensive combinatorial optimization. To tackle this problem, a two-step iterative approach, called RIS-aided NOMA, is proposed. In the first step, the UEs are clustered to the RISs according to their channel gains, while UAVs are associated to those generated clusters based on their reliability, which measures the criticality of UAVs. The second step optimally partitions the RISs to support each of the cluster members. In this step, we derive the closed-form equations for the optimal partitioning of RISs within the clusters. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RIS-aided NOMA yields a gain of 30% to 40%, respectively, compared to UAV traditional scheme. The finding emphasizes the potential of integrating RIS with UAV communications as a robust and reliable connectivity solution for future wireless communication systems.

Title: AI-based CSI Feedback with Digital Twins: Real-World Validation and Insights
Authors: Tzu-Hao Huang, Chao-Kai Wen, Shang-Ho Tsai, Trung Q. Duong
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has shown great potential for enhancing channel state information (CSI) feedback in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, a subject currently under study by the 3GPP standards body. Digital twins (DTs) have emerged as an effective means to generate site-specific datasets for training DL-based CSI feedback models. However, most existing studies rely solely on simulations, leaving the effectiveness of DTs in reducing DL training costs yet to be validated through realistic experimental setups. This paper addresses this gap by establishing a real-world (RW) environment and corresponding virtual channels using ray tracing with replicated 3D models and accurate antenna properties. We evaluate whether models trained in DT environments can effectively operate in RW scenarios and quantify the benefits of online learning (OL) for performance enhancement. Results show that a dedicated DT remains essential even with OL to achieve satisfactory performance in RW scenarios.

Title: Multi-Constraint Safe Reinforcement Learning via Closed-form Solution for Log-Sum-Exp Approximation of Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Chenggang Wang, Xinyi Wang, Yutong Dong, Lei Song, Xinping Guan
Abstract: The safety of training task policies and their subsequent application using reinforcement learning (RL) methods has become a focal point in the field of safe RL. A central challenge in this area remains the establishment of theoretical guarantees for safety during both the learning and deployment processes. Given the successful implementation of Control Barrier Function (CBF)-based safety strategies in a range of control-affine robotic systems, CBF-based safe RL demonstrates significant promise for practical applications in real-world scenarios. However, integrating these two approaches presents several challenges. First, embedding safety optimization within the RL training pipeline requires that the optimization outputs be differentiable with respect to the input parameters, a condition commonly referred to as differentiable optimization, which is non-trivial to solve. Second, the differentiable optimization framework confronts significant efficiency issues, especially when dealing with multi-constraint problems. To address these challenges, this paper presents a CBF-based safe RL architecture that effectively mitigates the issues outlined above. The proposed approach constructs a continuous AND logic approximation for the multiple constraints using a single composite CBF. By leveraging this approximation, a close-form solution of the quadratic programming is derived for the policy network in RL, thereby circumventing the need for differentiable optimization within the end-to-end safe RL pipeline. This strategy significantly reduces computational complexity because of the closed-form solution while maintaining safety guarantees. Simulation results demonstrate that, in comparison to existing approaches relying on differentiable optimization, the proposed method significantly reduces training computational costs while ensuring provable safety throughout the training process.

Title: Physical Limits and Optimal Synthesis of Beyond Diagonal Anomalous Scatterers
Authors: Mats Gustafsson
Abstract: Realizing metasurfaces for anomalous scattering is fundamental to designing reflector arrays, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, and metasurface antennas. However, the basic cost of steering scattering into non-specular directions is not fully understood. This paper derives tight physical bounds on anomalous scattering using antenna array systems equipped with non-local matching networks. The matching networks are explicitly synthesized based on the solutions of the optimization problems that define these bounds. Furthermore, we analyze fundamental limits for metasurface antennas implemented with metallic and dielectric materials exhibiting minimal loss within a finite design region. The results reveal a typical 6dB reduction in bistatic radar cross section (RCS) in anomalous directions compared to the forward direction. Numerical examples complement the theory and illustrate the inherent cost of achieving anomalous scattering relative to forward or specular scattering for canonical configurations.

Title: Decomposition Problem in Process of Selective Identification and Localization of Voltage Fluctuations Sources in Power Grids
Authors: Piotr Kuwałek
Abstract: Voltage fluctuations are common disturbances in power grids, therefore the effective and selective process of identification and localization of individual voltage fluctuations sources is necessary for the minimization of such disturbances. Selectivity in the process of identification and localization disturbing loads is possible by the use cascade of blocks: demodulation, decomposition and propagation assessment. The effectiveness of this approach is closely related to the used method of decomposition. The paper presents the problem of decomposition process for the selected method of selective identification and localization of voltage fluctuation sources, in which the algorithm of enhanced empirical wavelet transform (EEWT) is used as the decomposition method. The paper presents selected research results from the real power grid, for which the result of selected approach causes mistakes in the process of identification and localization of voltage fluctuations sources. The potential causes of such mistakes related to the decomposition process are discussed on the basis of obtained research results.

Title: Distributed Adaptive Signal Fusion for Fractional Programs
Authors: Cem Ates Musluoglu, Alexander Bertrand
Abstract: The distributed adaptive signal fusion (DASF) framework allows to solve spatial filtering optimization problems in a distributed and adaptive fashion over a bandwidth-constrained wireless sensor network. The DASF algorithm requires each node to sequentially build a compressed version of the original network-wide problem and solve it locally. However, these local problems can still result in a high computational load at the nodes, especially when the required solver is iterative. In this paper, we study the particular case of fractional programs, i.e., problems for which the objective function is a fraction of two continuous functions, which indeed require such iterative solvers. By exploiting the structure of a commonly used method for solving fractional programs and interleaving it with the iterations of the standard DASF algorithm, we obtain a distributed algorithm with a significantly reduced computational cost compared to the straightforward application of DASF as a meta-algorithm. We prove convergence and optimality of this "fractional DASF" (FDASF) algorithm and demonstrate its performance via numerical simulations.

Title: Steady-State Cascade Operators and their Role in Linear Control, Estimation, and Model Reduction Problems
Authors: John W. Simpson-Porco, Daniele Astolfi, Giordano Scarciotti
Abstract: Certain linear matrix operators arise naturally in systems analysis and design problems involving cascade interconnections of linear time-invariant systems, including problems of stabilization, estimation, and model order reduction. We conduct here a comprehensive study of these operators and their relevant system-theoretic properties. The general theory is leveraged to delineate both known and new design methodologies for control and observation of cascades, and to characterize structural properties of reduced models. Several entirely new designs arise from this systematic categorization, including new recursive and low-gain design frameworks for observation of cascaded systems. The benefits of the results beyond the linear time-invariant setting are demonstrated through preliminary extensions for nonlinear systems, with an outlook towards the development of a similarly comprehensive nonlinear theory.

Title: Spatiotemporal Tubes for Temporal Reach-Avoid-Stay Tasks in Unknown Systems
Authors: Ratnangshu Das, Ahan Basu, Pushpak Jagtap
Abstract: The paper considers the controller synthesis problem for general MIMO systems with unknown dynamics, aiming to fulfill the temporal reach-avoid-stay task, where the unsafe regions are time-dependent, and the target must be reached within a specified time frame. The primary aim of the paper is to construct the spatiotemporal tube (STT) using a sampling-based approach and thereby devise a closed-form approximation-free control strategy to ensure that system trajectory reaches the target set while avoiding time-dependent unsafe sets. The proposed scheme utilizes a novel method involving STTs to provide controllers that guarantee both system safety and reachability. In our sampling-based framework, we translate the requirements of STTs into a Robust optimization program (ROP). To address the infeasibility of ROP caused by infinite constraints, we utilize the sampling-based Scenario optimization program (SOP). Subsequently, we solve the SOP to generate the tube and closed-form controller for an unknown system, ensuring the temporal reach-avoid-stay specification. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through three case studies: an omnidirectional robot, a SCARA manipulator, and a magnetic levitation system.

Title: Segment-and-Classify: ROI-Guided Generalizable Contrast Phase Classification in CT Using XGBoost
Authors: Benjamin Hou, Tejas Sudharshan Mathai, Pritam Mukherjee, Xinya Wang, Ronald M. Summers, Zhiyong Lu
Abstract: Purpose: To automate contrast phase classification in CT using organ-specific features extracted from a widely used segmentation tool with a lightweight decision tree classifier. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study utilized three public CT datasets from separate institutions. The phase prediction model was trained on the WAW-TACE (median age: 66 [60,73]; 185 males) dataset, and externally validated on the VinDr-Multiphase (146 males; 63 females; 56 unk) and C4KC-KiTS (median age: 61 [50.68; 123 males) datasets. Contrast phase classification was performed using organ-specific features extracted by TotalSegmentator, followed by prediction using a gradient-boosted decision tree classifier. Results: On the VinDr-Multiphase dataset, the phase prediction model achieved the highest or comparable AUCs across all phases (>0.937), with superior F1-scores in the non-contrast (0.994), arterial (0.937), and delayed (0.718) phases. Statistical testing indicated significant performance differences only in the arterial and delayed phases (p<0.05). On the C4KC-KiTS dataset, the phase prediction model achieved the highest AUCs across all phases (>0.991), with superior F1-scores in arterial/venous (0.968) and delayed (0.935) phases. Statistical testing confirmed significant improvements over all baseline models in these two phases (p<0.05). Performance in the non-contrast class, however, was comparable across all models, with no statistically significant differences observed (p>0.05). Conclusion: The lightweight model demonstrated strong performance relative to all baseline models, and exhibited robust generalizability across datasets from different institutions.

Title: Rejuvenating IRS: AoI-based Low Overhead Reconfiguration Design
Authors: Jorge Torres Gómez, Joana Angjo, Moritz Garkisch, Vahid Jamali, Robert Schober, Falko Dressler
Abstract: Intelligent reflective surface (IRS) technologies help mitigate undesirable effects in wireless links by steering the communication signal between transmitters and receivers. IRS elements are configured to adjust the phase of the reflected signal for a user's location and enhance the perceived signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this way, an IRS improves the communication link but inevitably introduces more communication overhead. This occurs especially in mobile scenarios, where the user's position must be frequently estimated to re-adjust the IRS elements periodically. Such an operation requires balancing the amount of training versus the data time slots to optimize the communication performance in the link. Aiming to study this balance with the age of information (AoI) framework, we address the question of how often an IRS needs to be updated with the lowest possible overhead and the maximum of freshness of information. We derive the corresponding analytical solution for a mobile scenario, where the transmitter is static and the mobile user (MU) follows a random waypoint mobility model. We provide a closed-form expression for the average peak age of information (PAoI), as a metric to evaluate the impact of the IRS update frequency. As for the performance evaluation, we consider a realistic scenario following the IEEE 802.11ad standard, targeting the mmWave band. Our results reveal that the minimum achievable average PAoI is in the microsecond range and the optimal IRS update period is in the seconds range, causing 9% overhead in the link when the MU moves at a velocity of 1 m/s.

Title: Aligning Beam with Imbalanced Multi-modality: A Generative Federated Learning Approach
Authors: Jiahui Liang, Miaowen Wen, Shuoyao Wang, Yuxuan Liang, Shijian Gao
Abstract: As vehicle intelligence advances, multi-modal sensing-aided communication emerges as a key enabler for reliable Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) connectivity through precise environmental characterization. As centralized learning may suffer from data privacy, model heterogeneity and communication overhead issues, federated learning (FL) has been introduced to support V2X. However, the practical deployment of FL faces critical challenges: model performance degradation from label imbalance across vehicles and training instability induced by modality disparities in sensor-equipped agents. To overcome these limitations, we propose a generative FL approach for beam selection (GFL4BS). Our solution features two core innovations: 1) An adaptive zero-shot multi-modal generator coupled with spectral-regularized loss functions to enhance the expressiveness of synthetic data compensating for both label scarcity and missing modalities; 2) A hybrid training paradigm integrating feature fusion with decentralized optimization to ensure training resilience while minimizing communication costs. Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over baselines achieving 16.2% higher accuracy than the current state-of-the-art under severe label imbalance conditions while maintaining over 70% successful rate even when two agents lack both LiDAR and RGB camera inputs.

Title: Climate Science and Control Engineering: Insights, Parallels, and Connections
Authors: Salma M. Elsherif, Ahmad F. Taha
Abstract: Climate science is the multidisciplinary field that studies the Earth's climate and its evolution. At the very core of climate science are indispensable climate models that predict future climate scenarios, inform policy decisions, and dictate how a country's economy should change in light of the changing climate. Climate models capture a wide range of interacting dynamic processes via extremely complex ordinary and partial differential equations. To model these large-scale complex processes, climate science leverages supercomputers, advanced simulations, and statistical methods to predict future climate. An area of engineering that is rarely studied in climate science is control engineering. Given that climate systems are inherently dynamic, it is intuitive to analyze them within the framework of dynamic system science. This perspective has been underexplored in the literature. In this manuscript, we provide a tutorial that: (i) introduces the control engineering community to climate dynamics and modeling, including spatiotemporal scales and challenges in climate modeling; (ii) offers a fresh perspective on climate models from a control systems viewpoint; and (iii) explores the relevance and applicability of various advanced graph and network control-based approaches in building a physics-informed framework for learning, control and estimation in climate systems. We also present simple and then more complex climate models, depicting fundamental ideas and processes that are instrumental in building climate change projections. This tutorial also builds parallels and observes connections between various contemporary problems at the forefront of climate science and their control theoretic counterparts. We specifically observe that an abundance of climate science problems can be linguistically reworded and mathematically framed as control theoretic ones.

Title: On phase in scaled graphs
Authors: Sebastiaan van den Eijnden, Chao Chen, Koen Scheres, Thomas Chaffey, Alexander Lanzon
Abstract: The scaled graph has been introduced recently as a nonlinear extension of the classical Nyquist plot for linear time-invariant systems. In this paper, we introduce a modified definition for the scaled graph, termed the signed scaled graph (SSG), in which the phase component is characterized by making use of the Hilbert transform. Whereas the original definition of the scaled graph uses unsigned phase angles, the new definition has signed phase angles which ensures the possibility to differentiate between phase-lead and phase-lag properties in a system. Making such distinction is important from both an analysis and a synthesis perspective, and helps in providing tighter stability estimates of feedback interconnections. We show how the proposed SSG leads to intuitive characterizations of positive real and negative imaginary nonlinear systems, and present various interconnection results. We showcase the effectiveness of our results through several motivating examples.

Title: Task-Agnostic Semantic Communications Relying on Information Bottleneck and Federated Meta-Learning
Authors: Hao Wei, Wen Wang, Wanli Ni, Wenjun Xu, Yongming Huang, Dusit Niyato, Ping Zhang
Abstract: As a paradigm shift towards pervasive intelligence, semantic communication (SemCom) has shown great potentials to improve communication efficiency and provide user-centric services by delivering task-oriented semantic meanings. However, the exponential growth in connected devices, data volumes, and communication demands presents significant challenges for practical SemCom design, particularly in resource-constrained wireless networks. In this work, we first propose a task-agnostic SemCom (TASC) framework that can handle diverse tasks with multiple modalities. Aiming to explore the interplay between communications and intelligent tasks from the information-theoretical perspective, we leverage information bottleneck (IB) theory and propose a distributed multimodal IB (DMIB) principle to learn minimal and sufficient unimodal and multimodal information effectively by discarding redundancy while preserving task-related information. To further reduce the communication overhead, we develop an adaptive semantic feature transmission method under dynamic channel conditions. Then, TASC is trained based on federated meta-learning (FML) for rapid adaptation and generalization in wireless networks. To gain deep insights, we rigorously conduct theoretical analysis and devise resource management to accelerate convergence while minimizing the training latency and energy consumption. Moreover, we develop a joint user selection and resource allocation algorithm to address the non-convex problem with theoretical guarantees. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed TASC compared to baselines.

Title: Introduction to Online Control
Authors: Elad Hazan, Karan Singh
Abstract: This text presents an introduction to an emerging paradigm in control of dynamical systems and differentiable reinforcement learning called online nonstochastic control. The new approach applies techniques from online convex optimization and convex relaxations to obtain new methods with provable guarantees for classical settings in optimal and robust control. The primary distinction between online nonstochastic control and other frameworks is the objective. In optimal control, robust control, and other control methodologies that assume stochastic noise, the goal is to perform comparably to an offline optimal strategy. In online nonstochastic control, both the cost functions as well as the perturbations from the assumed dynamical model are chosen by an adversary. Thus the optimal policy is not defined a priori. Rather, the target is to attain low regret against the best policy in hindsight from a benchmark class of policies. This objective suggests the use of the decision making framework of online convex optimization as an algorithmic methodology. The resulting methods are based on iterative mathematical optimization algorithms, and are accompanied by finite-time regret and computational complexity guarantees.

Title: Accelerated First-Order Optimization under Nonlinear Constraints
Authors: Michael Muehlebach, Michael I. Jordan
Abstract: We exploit analogies between first-order algorithms for constrained optimization and non-smooth dynamical systems to design a new class of accelerated first-order algorithms for constrained optimization. Unlike Frank-Wolfe or projected gradients, these algorithms avoid optimization over the entire feasible set at each iteration. We prove convergence to stationary points even in a nonconvex setting and we derive accelerated rates for the convex setting both in continuous time, as well as in discrete time. An important property of these algorithms is that constraints are expressed in terms of velocities instead of positions, which naturally leads to sparse, local and convex approximations of the feasible set (even if the feasible set is nonconvex). Thus, the complexity tends to grow mildly in the number of decision variables and in the number of constraints, which makes the algorithms suitable for machine learning applications. We apply our algorithms to a compressed sensing and a sparse regression problem, showing that we can treat nonconvex $\ell^p$ constraints ($p<1$) efficiently, while recovering state-of-the-art performance for $p=1$.

Title: FOOL: Addressing the Downlink Bottleneck in Satellite Computing with Neural Feature Compression
Authors: Alireza Furutanpey, Qiyang Zhang, Philipp Raith, Tobias Pfandzelter, Shangguang Wang, Schahram Dustdar
Abstract: Nanosatellite constellations equipped with sensors capturing large geographic regions provide unprecedented opportunities for Earth observation. As constellation sizes increase, network contention poses a downlink bottleneck. Orbital Edge Computing (OEC) leverages limited onboard compute resources to reduce transfer costs by processing the raw captures at the source. However, current solutions have limited practicability due to reliance on crude filtering methods or over-prioritizing particular downstream tasks. This work presents FOOL, an OEC-native and task-agnostic feature compression method that preserves prediction performance. FOOL partitions high-resolution satellite imagery to maximize throughput. Further, it embeds context and leverages inter-tile dependencies to lower transfer costs with negligible overhead. While FOOL is a feature compressor, it can recover images with competitive scores on quality measures at lower bitrates. We extensively evaluate transfer cost reduction by including the peculiarity of intermittently available network connections in low earth orbit. Lastly, we test the feasibility of our system for standardized nanosatellite form factors. We demonstrate that FOOL permits downlinking over 100x the data volume without relying on prior information on the downstream tasks.

Title: Computational and Statistical Guarantees for Tensor-on-Tensor Regression with Tensor Train Decomposition
Authors: Zhen Qin, Zhihui Zhu
Abstract: Recently, a tensor-on-tensor (ToT) regression model has been proposed to generalize tensor recovery, encompassing scenarios like scalar-on-tensor regression and tensor-on-vector regression. However, the exponential growth in tensor complexity poses challenges for storage and computation in ToT regression. To overcome this hurdle, tensor decompositions have been introduced, with the tensor train (TT)-based ToT model proving efficient in practice due to reduced memory requirements, enhanced computational efficiency, and decreased sampling complexity. Despite these practical benefits, a disparity exists between theoretical analysis and real-world performance. In this paper, we delve into the theoretical and algorithmic aspects of the TT-based ToT regression model. Assuming the regression operator satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP), we conduct an error analysis for the solution to a constrained least-squares optimization problem. This analysis includes upper error bound and minimax lower bound, revealing that such error bounds polynomially depend on the order $N+M$. To efficiently find solutions meeting such error bounds, we propose two optimization algorithms: the iterative hard thresholding (IHT) algorithm (employing gradient descent with TT-singular value decomposition (TT-SVD)) and the factorization approach using the Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) algorithm. When RIP is satisfied, spectral initialization facilitates proper initialization, and we establish the linear convergence rate of both IHT and RGD.

Title: Enhancing clinical decision support with physiological waveforms -- a multimodal benchmark in emergency care
Authors: Juan Miguel Lopez Alcaraz, Hjalmar Bouma, Nils Strodthoff
Abstract: Background: AI-driven prediction algorithms have the potential to enhance emergency medicine by enabling rapid and accurate decision-making regarding patient status and potential deterioration. However, the integration of multimodal data, including raw waveform signals, remains underexplored in clinical decision support. Methods: We present a dataset and benchmarking protocol designed to advance multimodal decision support in emergency care. Our models utilize demographics, biometrics, vital signs, laboratory values, and electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms as inputs to predict both discharge diagnoses and patient deterioration. Results: The diagnostic model achieves area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) scores above 0.8 for 609 out of 1,428 conditions, covering both cardiac (e.g., myocardial infarction) and non-cardiac (e.g., renal disease, diabetes) diagnoses. The deterioration model attains AUROC scores above 0.8 for 14 out of 15 targets, accurately predicting critical events such as cardiac arrest, mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and mortality. Conclusions: Our study highlights the positive impact of incorporating raw waveform data into decision support models, improving predictive performance. By introducing a unique, publicly available dataset and baseline models, we provide a foundation for measurable progress in AI-driven decision support for emergency care.

Title: Mitigating Covariate Shift in Imitation Learning for Autonomous Vehicles Using Latent Space Generative World Models
Authors: Alexander Popov, Alperen Degirmenci, David Wehr, Shashank Hegde, Ryan Oldja, Alexey Kamenev, Bertrand Douillard, David Nistér, Urs Muller, Ruchi Bhargava, Stan Birchfield, Nikolai Smolyanskiy
Abstract: We propose the use of latent space generative world models to address the covariate shift problem in autonomous driving. A world model is a neural network capable of predicting an agent's next state given past states and actions. By leveraging a world model during training, the driving policy effectively mitigates covariate shift without requiring an excessive amount of training data. During end-to-end training, our policy learns how to recover from errors by aligning with states observed in human demonstrations, so that at runtime it can recover from perturbations outside the training distribution. Additionally, we introduce a novel transformer-based perception encoder that employs multi-view cross-attention and a learned scene query. We present qualitative and quantitative results, demonstrating significant improvements upon prior state of the art in closed-loop testing in the CARLA simulator, as well as showing the ability to handle perturbations in both CARLA and NVIDIA's DRIVE Sim.

Title: Sample-Efficient Quantum State Tomography for Structured Quantum States in One Dimension
Authors: Zhen Qin, Casey Jameson, Alireza Goldar, Michael B. Wakin, Zhexuan Gong, Zhihui Zhu
Abstract: While quantum state tomography (QST) remains the gold standard for benchmarking and verifying quantum devices, it requires an exponentially large number of measurements and classical computational resources for generic quantum many-body systems, making it impractical even for intermediate-size quantum devices. Fortunately, many physical quantum states often exhibit certain low-dimensional structures that enable the development of efficient QST. A notable example is the class of states represented by matrix product operators (MPOs) with a finite matrix/bond dimension, which include most physical states in one dimension and where the number of independent parameters describing the states only grows linearly with the number of qubits. Whether a sample efficient quantum state tomography protocol, where the number of required state copies scales only linearly as the number of parameters describing the state, exists for a generic MPO state still remains an important open question. In this paper, we answer this fundamental question affirmatively by using a class of informationally complete positive operator-valued measures (IC-POVMs) -- including symmetric IC-POVMs (SIC-POVMs) and spherical $t$-designs -- focusing on sample complexity while not accounting for the implementation complexity of the measurement settings. For SIC-POVMs and (approximate) spherical 2-designs, we show that the number of state copies to guarantee bounded recovery error of an MPO state with a constrained least-squares estimator depends on the probability distribution of the MPO under the POVM but scales only linearly with $n$ when the distribution is approximately uniform. For spherical $t$-designs with $t\geq 3$, we prove that only a number of state copies proportional to the number of independent parameters in the MPO is sufficient for a guaranteed recovery of any state represented by an MPO.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years has profoundly reshaped modern lifestyles, necessitating a revolutionary architecture to support the growing demands for computational power. Cloud computing has become the driving force behind this transformation. However, it consumes significant power and faces computation security risks due to the reliance on extensive data centers and servers in the cloud. Reducing power consumption while enhancing computational scale remains persistent challenges in cloud computing. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an optical cloud computing system that can be seamlessly deployed across edge-metro network. By modulating inputs and models into light, a wide range of edge nodes can directly access the optical computing center via the edge-metro network. The experimental validations show an energy efficiency of 118.6 mW/TOPs (tera operations per second), reducing energy consumption by two orders of magnitude compared to traditional electronic-based cloud computing solutions. Furthermore, it is experimentally validated that this architecture can perform various complex generative AI models through parallel computing to achieve image generation tasks.

Title: Distilling Calibration via Conformalized Credal Inference
Authors: Jiayi Huang, Sangwoo Park, Nicola Paoletti, Osvaldo Simeone
Abstract: Deploying artificial intelligence (AI) models on edge devices involves a delicate balance between meeting stringent complexity constraints, such as limited memory and energy resources, and ensuring reliable performance in sensitive decision-making tasks. One way to enhance reliability is through uncertainty quantification via Bayesian inference. This approach, however, typically necessitates maintaining and running multiple models in an ensemble, which may exceed the computational limits of edge devices. This paper introduces a low-complexity methodology to address this challenge by distilling calibration information from a more complex model. In an offline phase, predictive probabilities generated by a high-complexity cloud-based model are leveraged to determine a threshold based on the typical divergence between the cloud and edge models. At run time, this threshold is used to construct credal sets -- ranges of predictive probabilities that are guaranteed, with a user-selected confidence level, to include the predictions of the cloud model. The credal sets are obtained through thresholding of a divergence measure in the simplex of predictive probabilities. Experiments on visual and language tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach, termed Conformalized Distillation for Credal Inference (CD-CI), significantly improves calibration performance compared to low-complexity Bayesian methods, such as Laplace approximation, making it a practical and efficient solution for edge AI deployments.

Title: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Power Grid Topology Control
Authors: Thomas Lautenbacher, Ali Rajaei, Davide Barbieri, Jan Viebahn, Jochen L. Cremer
Abstract: Transmission grid congestion increases as the electrification of various sectors requires transmitting more power. Topology control, through substation reconfiguration, can reduce congestion but its potential remains under-exploited in operations. A challenge is modeling the topology control problem to align well with the objectives and constraints of operators. Addressing this challenge, this paper investigates the application of multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) to integrate multiple conflicting objectives for power grid topology control. We develop a MORL approach using deep optimistic linear support (DOL) and multi-objective proximal policy optimization (MOPPO) to generate a set of Pareto-optimal policies that balance objectives such as minimizing line loading, topological deviation, and switching frequency. Initial case studies show that the MORL approach can provide valuable insights into objective trade-offs and improve Pareto front approximation compared to a random search baseline. The generated multi-objective RL policies are 30% more successful in preventing grid failure under contingencies and 20% more effective when training budget is reduced - compared to the common single objective RL policy.

Title: Generative Predictive Control: Flow Matching Policies for Dynamic and Difficult-to-Demonstrate Tasks
Authors: Vince Kurtz, Joel W. Burdick
Abstract: Generative control policies have recently unlocked major progress in robotics. These methods produce action sequences via diffusion or flow matching, with training data provided by demonstrations. But existing methods come with two key limitations: they require expert demonstrations, which can be difficult to obtain, and they are limited to relatively slow, quasi-static tasks. In this paper, we leverage a tight connection between sampling-based predictive control and generative modeling to address each of these issues. In particular, we introduce generative predictive control, a supervised learning framework for tasks with fast dynamics that are easy to simulate but difficult to demonstrate. We then show how trained flow-matching policies can be warm-started at inference time, maintaining temporal consistency and enabling high-frequency feedback. We believe that generative predictive control offers a complementary approach to existing behavior cloning methods, and hope that it paves the way toward generalist policies that extend beyond quasi-static demonstration-oriented tasks.

Title: MFSR-GAN: Multi-Frame Super-Resolution with Handheld Motion Modeling
Authors: Fadeel Sher Khan, Joshua Ebenezer, Hamid Sheikh, Seok-Jun Lee
Abstract: Smartphone cameras have become ubiquitous imaging tools, yet their small sensors and compact optics often limit spatial resolution and introduce distortions. Combining information from multiple low-resolution (LR) frames to produce a high-resolution (HR) image has been explored to overcome the inherent limitations of smartphone cameras. Despite the promise of multi-frame super-resolution (MFSR), current approaches are hindered by datasets that fail to capture the characteristic noise and motion patterns found in real-world handheld burst images. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a novel synthetic data engine that uses multi-exposure static images to synthesize LR-HR training pairs while preserving sensor-specific noise characteristics and image motion found during handheld burst photography. We also propose MFSR-GAN: a multi-scale RAW-to-RGB network for MFSR. Compared to prior approaches, MFSR-GAN emphasizes a "base frame" throughout its architecture to mitigate artifacts. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data demonstrates that MFSR-GAN trained with our synthetic engine yields sharper, more realistic reconstructions than existing methods for real-world MFSR.

Title: Enhancing the Security of Semantic Communication via Knowledge-Aided Coding and Jamming
Authors: Weixuan Chen, Qianqian Yang, Shuo Shao, Zhiguo Shi, Jiming Chen, Xuemin (Sherman)Shen
Abstract: As semantic communication (SemCom) emerges as a promising communication paradigm, ensuring the security of semantic information over open wireless channels has become crucial. Traditional encryption methods introduce considerable communication overhead, while existing learning-based secure SemCom schemes often rely on a channel capacity advantage for the legitimate receiver, which is challenging to guarantee in practice. In this paper, we propose a coding-enhanced jamming approach that eliminates the need to transmit a secret key by utilizing shared knowledge between the legitimate receiver and the transmitter. We generate private codebooks with neural network (NN)-based encoders, using them to encode data into a sequence Y1, which is then superposed with a sequence Y2 drawn from the private codebook. By optimizing the power allocation between the two sequences, the legitimate receiver can successfully decode the data, while the eavesdropper' s performance is significantly degraded, potentially to the point of random guessing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves comparable security to state-of-the-art approaches while significantly improving the reconstruction performance of the legitimate receiver by more than 1 dB across varying channel signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and compression ratios.

Title: Fast Sign Retrieval via Sub-band Convolution: An Elementary Extension of Binary Classification
Authors: Fuma Ito, Chihiro Tsutake, Keita Takahashi, Toshiaki Fujii
Abstract: To efficiently compress the sign information of images, we address a sign retrieval problem for the block-wise discrete cosine transformation (DCT): reconstruction of the signs of DCT coefficients from their amplitudes. To this end, we propose a fast sign retrieval method on the basis of binary classification machine learning. We first introduce 3D representations of the amplitudes and signs, where we pack amplitudes/signs belonging to the same frequency band into a 2D slice, referred to as the sub-band block. We then retrieve the signs from the 3D amplitudes via binary classification, where each sign is regarded as a binary label. We implement a binary classification algorithm using convolutional neural networks, which are advantageous for efficiently extracting features in the 3D amplitudes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves accurate sign retrieval with an overwhelmingly low computation cost.
