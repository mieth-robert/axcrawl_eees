Title: RINN: One Sample Radio Frequency Imaging based on Physics Informed Neural Network
Authors: Fei Shang, Haohua Du, Dawei Yan, Panlong Yang, Xiang-Yang Li
Abstract: Due to its ability to work in non-line-of-sight and low-light environments, radio frequency (RF) imaging technology is expected to bring new possibilities for embodied intelligence and multimodal sensing. However, widely used RF devices (such as Wi-Fi) often struggle to provide high-precision electromagnetic measurements and large-scale datasets, hindering the application of RF imaging technology. In this paper, we combine the ideas of PINN to design the RINN network, using physical constraints instead of true value comparison constraints and adapting it with the characteristics of ubiquitous RF signals, allowing the RINN network to achieve RF imaging using only one sample without phase and with amplitude noise. Our numerical evaluation results show that compared with 5 classic algorithms based on phase data for imaging results, RINN's imaging results based on phaseless data are good, with indicators such as RRMSE (0.11) performing similarly well. RINN provides new possibilities for the universal development of radio frequency imaging technology.

Title: Enhancing DR Classification with Swin Transformer and Shifted Window Attention
Authors: Meher Boulaabi, Takwa Ben AÃ¯cha Gader, Afef Kacem Echi, Zied Bouraoui
Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, underscoring the importance of early detection for effective treatment. However, automated DR classification remains challenging due to variations in image quality, class imbalance, and pixel-level similarities that hinder model training. To address these issues, we propose a robust preprocessing pipeline incorporating image cropping, Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), and targeted data augmentation to improve model generalization and resilience. Our approach leverages the Swin Transformer, which utilizes hierarchical token processing and shifted window attention to efficiently capture fine-grained features while maintaining linear computational complexity. We validate our method on the Aptos and IDRiD datasets for multi-class DR classification, achieving accuracy rates of 89.65% and 97.40%, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, particularly in detecting early-stage DR, highlighting its potential for improving automated retinal screening in clinical settings.

Title: Learned Primal Dual Splitting for Self-Supervised Noise-Adaptive MRI Reconstruction
Authors: Nikola Janjusevic, Amirhoussein Khalilian-Gourtani, Yao Wang, Li Feng
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction has largely been dominated by deep neural networks (DNN); however, many state-of-the-art architectures use black-box structures, which hinder interpretability and improvement. Here, we propose an interpretable DNN architecture for self-supervised MRI reconstruction and denoising by directly parameterizing and learning the classical primal-dual splitting, dubbed LPDSNet. This splitting algorithm allows us to decouple the observation model from the signal prior. Experimentally, we show other interpretable architectures without this decoupling property exhibit failure in the self-supervised learning regime. We report state-of-the-art self-supervised joint MRI reconstruction and denoising performance and novel noise-level generalization capabilities, where in contrast black-box networks fail to generalize.

Title: A Quadratic Control Framework for Dynamic Systems
Authors: Igor Ladnik
Abstract: This article presents a unified approach to quadratic optimal control for both linear and nonlinear discrete-time systems, with a focus on trajectory tracking. The control strategy is based on minimizing a quadratic cost function that penalizes deviations of system states and control inputs from their desired trajectories. For linear systems, the classical Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) solution is derived using dynamic programming, resulting in recursive equations for feedback and feedforward terms. For nonlinear dynamics, the Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) method is employed, which iteratively linearizes the system and solves a sequence of LQR problems to converge to an optimal policy. To implement this approach, a software service was developed and tested on several canonical models, including: Rayleigh oscillator, inverted pendulum on a moving cart, two-link manipulator, and quadcopter. The results confirm that iLQR enables efficient and accurate trajectory tracking in the presence of nonlinearities. To further enhance performance, it can be seamlessly integrated with Model Predictive Control (MPC), enabling online adaptation and improved robustness to constraints and system uncertainties.

Title: Safety Embedded Adaptive Control Using Barrier States
Authors: Maitham F. AL-Sunni, Hassan Almubarak, John M. Dolan
Abstract: In this work, we explore the application of barrier states (BaS) in the realm of safe nonlinear adaptive control. Our proposed framework derives barrier states for systems with parametric uncertainty, which are augmented into the uncertain dynamical model. We employ an adaptive nonlinear control strategy based on a control Lyapunov functions approach to design a stabilizing controller for the augmented system. The developed theory shows that the controller ensures safe control actions for the original system while meeting specified performance objectives. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations on diverse systems, including a planar quadrotor subject to unknown drag forces and an adaptive cruise control system, for which we provide comparisons with existing methodologies.

Title: Underwater Multi-Wavelength Optical Links With Blue Targets and Constraints: Opportunities and Challenges
Authors: Alain R. Ndjiongue, Octavia A. Dobre, Hyundong Shin, Harald Haas
Abstract: Underwater optical wireless technologies offer multiple advantages over the acoustic technology. Acoustic signals, for instance, are susceptible to noise from marine sources due to marine life and human activities. This is not the case with optical signals. However, absorption and scattering significantly attenuate optical signals. This limits the communication range and requires higher transmission power or more sensitive receivers to detect transmitted light. Therefore, it is necessary to design underwater optical systems with a higher transmission rate and reduced attenuation. To this end, we introduce a framework for designing optical signaling constellations employing multi-wavelength light sources to account for the transmission distance and achievable rate. In particular, we redefine the color-shift keying (CSK) constraint region to target blue light and adapt to marine environments. We discuss an example of 4-point underwater CSK. The corresponding analytical results demonstrate the trade-offs between the symbol error probability, achievable rate, and transmission range of the proposed scheme.

Title: Nearly Optimal Nonlinear Safe Control with BaS-SDRE
Authors: Hassan Almubarak, Maitham F. AL-Sunni, Justin T. Dubbin, Nader Sadegh, John M. Dolan, Evangelos A. Theodorou
Abstract: The State-Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) approach has emerged as a systematic and effective means of designing nearly optimal nonlinear controllers. The Barrier States (BaS) embedding methodology was developed recently for safe multi-objective controls in which the safety condition is manifested as a state to be controlled along with other states of the system. The overall system, termed the safety embedded system, is highly nonlinear even if the original system is linear. This paper develops a nonlinear nearly optimal safe feedback control technique by combining the two strategies effectively. First, the BaS is derived in an extended linearization formulation to be subsequently used to form an extended safety embedded system. A new optimal control problem is formed thereafter, which is used to construct a safety embedded State-Dependent Riccati Equation, termed BaS-SDRE, whose solution approximates the solution of the optimal control problem's associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. The BaS-SDRE is then solved online to synthesize the nearly optimal safe control. The proposed technique's efficacy is demonstrated on an unstable, constrained linear system that shows how the synthesized control reacts to nonlinearities near the unsafe region, a nonlinear flight control system with limited path angular velocity that exists due to structural and dynamic concerns, and a planar quadrotor system that navigates safely in a crowded environment.

Title: Split-quaternions for perceptual white balance
Authors: Michel Berthier, Nicoletta Prencipe, Edoardo Provenzi
Abstract: We propose a perceptual chromatic adaptation transform for white balance that makes use of split-quaternions. The novelty of the present work, which is motivated by a recently developed quantum-like model of color perception, consists at stressing the link between the algebraic structures appearing in this model and a certain sub-algebra of the split-quaternions. We show the potentiality of this approach for color image processing applications by proposing a chromatic adaptation transform, implemented via an appropriate use of the split-quaternion multiplication. Moreover, quantitative comparisons with the widely used state-of-the art von Kries chromatic adaptation transform are provided.

Title: Learning-Based Two-Way Communications: Algorithmic Framework and Comparative Analysis
Authors: David R. Nickel, Anindya Bijoy Das, David J. Love, Christopher G. Brinton
Abstract: Machine learning (ML)-based feedback channel coding has garnered significant research interest in the past few years. However, there has been limited research exploring ML approaches in the so-called "two-way" setting where two users jointly encode messages and feedback for each other over a shared channel. In this work, we present a general architecture for ML-based two-way feedback coding, and show how several popular one-way schemes can be converted to the two-way setting through our framework. We compare such schemes against their one-way counterparts, revealing error-rate benefits of ML-based two-way coding in certain signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. We then analyze the tradeoffs between error performance and computational overhead for three state-of-the-art neural network coding models instantiated in the two-way paradigm.

Title: Element-Grouping Strategy for Intelligent Reflecting Surface: Performance Analysis and Algorithm Optimization
Authors: Shengsheng Zhang, Taotao Ji, Meng Hua, Yongming Huang, Luxi Yang
Abstract: As a revolutionary paradigm for intelligently controlling wireless channels, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as a promising technology for future sixth-generation (6G) wireless communications. While IRS-aided communication systems can achieve attractive high channel gains, existing schemes require plenty of IRS elements to mitigate the ``multiplicative fading'' effect in cascaded channels, leading to high complexity for real-time beamforming and high signaling overhead for channel estimation. In this paper, the concept of sustainable intelligent element-grouping IRS (IEG-IRS) is proposed to overcome those fundamental bottlenecks. Specifically, based on the statistical channel state information (S-CSI), the proposed grouping strategy intelligently pre-divide the IEG-IRS elements into multiple groups based on the beam-domain grouping method, with each group sharing the common reflection coefficient and being optimized in real time using the instantaneous channel state information (I-CSI). Then, we further analyze the asymptotic performance of the IEG-IRS to reveal the substantial capacity gain in an extremely large-scale IRS (XL-IRS) aided single-user single-input single-output (SU-SISO) system. In particular, when a line-of-sight (LoS) component exists, it demonstrates that the combined cascaded link can be considered as a ``deterministic virtual LoS'' channel, resulting in a sustainable squared array gain achieved by the IEG-IRS. Finally, we formulate a weighted-sum-rate (WSR) maximization problem for an IEG-IRS-aided multiuser multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) system and a two-stage algorithm for optimizing the beam-domain grouping strategy and the multi-user active-passive beamforming is proposed.

Title: Explicit Ensemble Mean Clock Synchronization for Optimal Atomic Time Scale Generation
Authors: Takayuki Ishizaki, Takahiro Kawaguchi, Yuichiro Yano, Yuko Hanado
Abstract: This paper presents a novel theoretical framework for atomic time scale generation, called explicit ensemble mean synchronization, which unifies clock synchronization and time scale generation within a control-theoretic paradigm. By exploiting an observable canonical decomposition of a standard atomic clock ensemble model, the system is decomposed into two complementary components: the observable part, which represents the synchronization deviation, and the unobservable part, which captures the synchronization destination. Within this structure, we mathematically prove that standard Kalman filtering, widely used in current time scale generation, can be interpreted as a special case of the proposed framework that optimizes long-term frequency stability in terms of the Allan variance. Furthermore, by applying appropriate state feedback control to each component based on the Kalman filtering, both clock synchronization and optimal time scale generation are achieved within a unified framework. This framework provides a principled basis for robust timekeeping systems that goes beyond conventional approaches in both scope and performance.

Title: VLM-based Prompts as the Optimal Assistant for Unpaired Histopathology Virtual Staining
Authors: Zizhi Chen, Xinyu Zhang, Minghao Han, Yizhou Liu, Ziyun Qian, Weifeng Zhang, Xukun Zhang, Jingwei Wei, Lihua Zhang
Abstract: In histopathology, tissue sections are typically stained using common H&E staining or special stains (MAS, PAS, PASM, etc.) to clearly visualize specific tissue structures. The rapid advancement of deep learning offers an effective solution for generating virtually stained images, significantly reducing the time and labor costs associated with traditional histochemical staining. However, a new challenge arises in separating the fundamental visual characteristics of tissue sections from the visual differences induced by staining agents. Additionally, virtual staining often overlooks essential pathological knowledge and the physical properties of staining, resulting in only style-level transfer. To address these issues, we introduce, for the first time in virtual staining tasks, a pathological vision-language large model (VLM) as an auxiliary tool. We integrate contrastive learnable prompts, foundational concept anchors for tissue sections, and staining-specific concept anchors to leverage the extensive knowledge of the pathological VLM. This approach is designed to describe, frame, and enhance the direction of virtual staining. Furthermore, we have developed a data augmentation method based on the constraints of the VLM. This method utilizes the VLM's powerful image interpretation capabilities to further integrate image style and structural information, proving beneficial in high-precision pathological diagnostics. Extensive evaluations on publicly available multi-domain unpaired staining datasets demonstrate that our method can generate highly realistic images and enhance the accuracy of downstream tasks, such as glomerular detection and segmentation.

Title: Exploring the User Experience of AI-Assisted Sound Searching Systems for Creative Workflows
Authors: Haohe Liu, Thomas Deacon, Wenwu Wang, Matt Paradis, Mark D. Plumbley
Abstract: Locating the right sound effect efficiently is an important yet challenging topic for audio production. Most current sound-searching systems rely on pre-annotated audio labels created by humans, which can be time-consuming to produce and prone to inaccuracies, limiting the efficiency of audio production. Following the recent advancement of contrastive language-audio pre-training (CLAP) models, we explore an alternative CLAP-based sound-searching system (CLAP-UI) that does not rely on human annotations. To evaluate the effectiveness of CLAP-UI, we conducted comparative experiments with a widely used sound effect searching platform, the BBC Sound Effect Library. Our study evaluates user performance, cognitive load, and satisfaction through ecologically valid tasks based on professional sound-searching workflows. Our result shows that CLAP-UI demonstrated significantly enhanced productivity and reduced frustration while maintaining comparable cognitive demands. We also qualitatively analyzed the participants' feedback, which offered valuable perspectives on the design of future AI-assisted sound search systems.

Title: Real-Time Optimal Design of Experiment for Parameter Identification of Li-Ion Cell Electrochemical Model
Authors: Ian Mikesell, Samuel Filgueira da Silva, Mehmet Fatih Ozkan, Faissal El Idrissi, Prashanth Ramesh, Marcello Canova
Abstract: Accurately identifying the parameters of electrochemical models of li-ion battery (LiB) cells is a critical task for enhancing the fidelity and predictive ability. Traditional parameter identification methods often require extensive data collection experiments and lack adaptability in dynamic environments. This paper describes a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based approach that dynamically tailors the current profile applied to a LiB cell to optimize the parameters identifiability of the electrochemical model. The proposed framework is implemented in real-time using a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) setup, which serves as a reliable testbed for evaluating the RL-based design strategy. The HIL validation confirms that the RL-based experimental design outperforms conventional test protocols used for parameter identification in terms of both reducing the modeling errors on a verification test and minimizing the duration of the experiment used for parameter identification.

Title: An ACO-MPC Framework for Energy-Efficient and Collision-Free Path Planning in Autonomous Maritime Navigation
Authors: Yaoze Liu, Zhen Tian, Qifan Zhou, Zixuan Huang, Hongyu Sun
Abstract: Automated driving on ramps presents significant challenges due to the need to balance both safety and efficiency during lane changes. This paper proposes an integrated planner for automated vehicles (AVs) on ramps, utilizing an unsatisfactory level metric for efficiency and arrow-cluster-based sampling for safety. The planner identifies optimal times for the AV to change lanes, taking into account the vehicle's velocity as a key factor in efficiency. Additionally, the integrated planner employs arrow-cluster-based sampling to evaluate collision risks and select an optimal lane-changing curve. Extensive simulations were conducted in a ramp scenario to verify the planner's efficient and safe performance. The results demonstrate that the proposed planner can effectively select an appropriate lane-changing time point and a safe lane-changing curve for AVs, without incurring any collisions during the maneuver.

Title: Joint Security-Latency Design for Short Packet-Based Low-Altitude Communications
Authors: Zeyin Wang, Di Zhang, Shaobo Jia, Lulu Song, Yanqun Tang
Abstract: In this article, a joint security and latency analysis of short packet-based low-altitude communications when the eavesdropper is close to the receiver is addressed. To reveal the impacts of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and block-length on latency in communications, we propose a new metric named secure latency (SL) and derive the expressions for the effective secure probability (ESP) and the average SL. To minimize the average SL, different transmission designs are analyzed, in which the optimal solutions of SNR and block-length are provided. Numerical results validate our analysis and reveal the trade-off between reliability and security and the impacts of the block-length, SNR, and packet-generating rate on average SL, of which SNR and the block-length account for main factors. In addition, we find that the performance of SL can be enhanced by allocating less SNR.

Title: RepNet-VSR: Reparameterizable Architecture for High-Fidelity Video Super-Resolution
Authors: Biao Wu, Diankai Zhang, Shaoli Liu, Si Gao, Chengjian Zheng, Ning Wang
Abstract: As a fundamental challenge in visual computing, video super-resolution (VSR) focuses on reconstructing highdefinition video sequences from their degraded lowresolution counterparts. While deep convolutional neural networks have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in spatial-temporal super-resolution tasks, their computationally intensive nature poses significant deployment challenges for resource-constrained edge devices, particularly in real-time mobile video processing scenarios where power efficiency and latency constraints coexist. In this work, we propose a Reparameterizable Architecture for High Fidelity Video Super Resolution method, named RepNet-VSR, for real-time 4x video super-resolution. On the REDS validation set, the proposed model achieves 27.79 dB PSNR when processing 180p to 720p frames in 103 ms per 10 frames on a MediaTek Dimensity NPU. The competition results demonstrate an excellent balance between restoration quality and deployment efficiency. The proposed method scores higher than the previous champion algorithm of MAI video super-resolution challenge.

Title: FADEL: Uncertainty-aware Fake Audio Detection with Evidential Deep Learning
Authors: Ju Yeon Kang, Ji Won Yoon, Semin Kim, Min Hyun Han, Nam Soo Kim
Abstract: Recently, fake audio detection has gained significant attention, as advancements in speech synthesis and voice conversion have increased the vulnerability of automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems to spoofing attacks. A key challenge in this task is generalizing models to detect unseen, out-of-distribution (OOD) attacks. Although existing approaches have shown promising results, they inherently suffer from overconfidence issues due to the usage of softmax for classification, which can produce unreliable predictions when encountering unpredictable spoofing attempts. To deal with this limitation, we propose a novel framework called fake audio detection with evidential learning (FADEL). By modeling class probabilities with a Dirichlet distribution, FADEL incorporates model uncertainty into its predictions, thereby leading to more robust performance in OOD scenarios. Experimental results on the ASVspoof2019 Logical Access (LA) and ASVspoof2021 LA datasets indicate that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of baseline models. Furthermore, we demonstrate the validity of uncertainty estimation by analyzing a strong correlation between average uncertainty and equal error rate (EER) across different spoofing algorithms.

Title: Performance Estimation for Supervised Medical Image Segmentation Models on Unlabeled Data Using UniverSeg
Authors: Jingchen Zou, Jianqiang Li, Gabriel Jimenez, Qing Zhao, Daniel Racoceanu, Matias Cosarinsky, Enzo Ferrante, Guanghui Fu
Abstract: The performance of medical image segmentation models is usually evaluated using metrics like the Dice score and Hausdorff distance, which compare predicted masks to ground truth annotations. However, when applying the model to unseen data, such as in clinical settings, it is often impractical to annotate all the data, making the model's performance uncertain. To address this challenge, we propose the Segmentation Performance Evaluator (SPE), a framework for estimating segmentation models' performance on unlabeled data. This framework is adaptable to various evaluation metrics and model architectures. Experiments on six publicly available datasets across six evaluation metrics including pixel-based metrics such as Dice score and distance-based metrics like HD95, demonstrated the versatility and effectiveness of our approach, achieving a high correlation (0.956$\pm$0.046) and low MAE (0.025$\pm$0.019) compare with real Dice score on the independent test set. These results highlight its ability to reliably estimate model performance without requiring annotations. The SPE framework integrates seamlessly into any model training process without adding training overhead, enabling performance estimation and facilitating the real-world application of medical image segmentation algorithms. The source code is publicly available

Title: On relaxing the N-Reachability Implicit Requirement in NMPC Design
Authors: Mazen Alamir
Abstract: This paper proposes a proof of stability for Model Predictive Control formulations involving a prediction horizon that might be too short to meet the reachability condition generally invoked as a sufficient condition for closed-loop stability. This condition is replaced by a contraction condition on the stage cost. But unlike the contraction based existing formulations where the prediction horizon becomes a decision variable, the formulation proposed in this paper remains standard in that it uses constant and short prediction horizon. An illustrative example is provided to assess the relevance of the proposed formulation.

Title: Distributed model predictive control without terminal cost under inexact distributed optimization
Authors: Xiaoyu Liu, Dimos V. Dimarogonas, Changxin Liu, Azita Dabiri, Bart De Schutter
Abstract: This paper presents a novel distributed model predictive control (MPC) formulation without terminal cost and a corresponding distributed synthesis approach for distributed linear discrete-time systems with coupled constraints. The proposed control scheme introduces an explicit stability condition as an additional constraint based on relaxed dynamic programming. As a result, contrary to other related approaches, system stability with the developed controller does not rely on designing a terminal cost. A distributed synthesis approach is then introduced to handle the stability constraint locally within each local agent. To solve the underlying optimization problem for distributed MPC, a violation-free distributed optimization approach is developed, using constraint tightening to ensure feasibility throughout iterations. A numerical example demonstrates that the proposed distributed MPC approach ensures closed-loop stability for each feasible control sequence, with each agent computing its control input in parallel.

Title: A Point-Hyperplane Geometry Method for Operational Security Region of Renewable Energy Generation in Power Systems
Authors: Can Wan, Biao Li, Xuejun Hu, Yunyi Li, Ping Ju
Abstract: The rapid growth of renewable energy generation challenges the secure operation of power systems. It becomes crucial to quantify the critical security boundaries and hosting capability of renewable generation at the system operation level. This paper proposes a novel point-hyperplane geometry (PHG) method to accurately obtain the geometric expression of the operational security region of renewable energy generation for power systems. Firstly, the geometric expression of the operational security region is defined as a polytope of boundary hyperplanes in the form of inequalities satisfying the system operation constraints. Then, an orthogonal basis generation method is proposed to solve a single boundary hyperplane of the polytope based on intersecting and orthogonal geometric principles. Next, a point-hyperplane iteration algorithm is developed to progressively obtain the overall geometric polytope of the operational security region of renewable energy generation in power systems. Besides, the flexible performance trade-off can be achieved by modifying the proposed maximum tolerated angle between adjacent hyperplanes. Finally, comprehensive case studies verify the effectiveness and superiority of the PHG method.

Title: Finite time max-consensus for simultaneous target interception in switching graph topologies
Authors: Kushal P. Singh, Aditya K. Rao, Twinkle Tripathy
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a distributed guidance law for the simultaneous interception of a stationary target. For a group of `n' heterogeneous pursuers, the proposed guidance law establishes the necessary conditions on static graphs that ensure simultaneous target interception, regardless of the initial conditions of the pursuers. Building on these results, we also establish the necessary conditions for achieving simultaneous interception in switching graph topologies as well. The major highlight of the work is that the target interception occurs in finite time for both static and switching graph topologies. We demonstrate all of these results through numerical simulations.

Title: No-Regret Model Predictive Control with Online Learning of Koopman Operators
Authors: Hongyu Zhou, Vasileios Tzoumas
Abstract: We study a problem of simultaneous system identification and model predictive control of nonlinear systems. Particularly, we provide an algorithm for systems with unknown residual dynamics that can be expressed by Koopman operators. Such residual dynamics can model external disturbances and modeling errors, such as wind and wave disturbances to aerial and marine vehicles, or inaccurate model parameters. The algorithm has finite-time near-optimality guarantees and asymptotically converges to the optimal non-causal controller. Specifically, the algorithm enjoys sublinear \textit{dynamic regret}, defined herein as the suboptimality against an optimal clairvoyant controller that knows how the unknown dynamics will adapt to its states and actions. To this end, we assume the algorithm is given Koopman observable functions such that the unknown dynamics can be approximated by a linear dynamical system. Then, it employs model predictive control based on the current learned model of the unknown residual dynamics. This model is updated online using least squares in a self-supervised manner based on the data collected while controlling the system. We validate our algorithm in physics-based simulations of a cart-pole system aiming to maintain the pole upright despite inaccurate model parameters.

Title: Predictive Synthesis of Control Barrier Functions and its Application to Time-Varying Constraints
Authors: Adrian Wiltz, Dimos V. Dimarogonas
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic method for synthesizing a Control Barrier Function (CBF) that encodes predictive information into a CBF. Unlike other methods, the synthesized CBF can account for changes and time-variations in the constraints even when constructed for time-invariant constraints. This avoids recomputing the CBF when the constraint specifications change. The method provides an explicit characterization of the extended class K function {\alpha} that determines the dynamic properties of the CBF, and {\alpha} can even be explicitly chosen as a design parameter in the controller synthesis. The resulting CBF further accounts for input constraints, and its values can be determined at any point without having to compute the CBF over the entire domain. The synthesis method is based on a finite horizon optimal control problem inspired by Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis and does not rely on a nominal control law. The synthesized CBF is time-invariant if the constraints are. The method poses mild assumptions on the controllability of the dynamic system and assumes the knowledge of at least a subset of some control invariant set. The paper provides a detailed analysis of the properties of the synthesized CBF, including its application to time-varying constraints. A simulation study applies the proposed approach to various dynamic systems in the presence of time-varying constraints. The paper is accompanied by an online available parallelized implementation of the proposed synthesis method.

Title: Gaussian behaviors: representations and data-driven control
Authors: AndrÃ¡s Sasfi, Ivan Markovsky, Alberto Padoan, Florian DÃ¶rfler
Abstract: We propose a modeling framework for stochastic systems based on Gaussian processes. Finite-length trajectories of the system are modeled as random vectors from a Gaussian distribution, which we call a Gaussian behavior. The proposed model naturally quantifies the uncertainty in the trajectories, yet it is simple enough to allow for tractable formulations. We relate the proposed model to existing descriptions of dynamical systems including deterministic and stochastic behaviors, and linear time-invariant (LTI) state-space models with Gaussian process and measurement noise. Gaussian behaviors can be estimated directly from observed data as the empirical sample covariance under the assumption that the measured trajectories are from independent experiments. The distribution of future outputs conditioned on inputs and past outputs provides a predictive model that can be incorporated in predictive control frameworks. We show that subspace predictive control (SPC) is a certainty-equivalence control formulation with the estimated Gaussian behavior. Furthermore, the regularized data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) method is shown to be a distributionally optimistic formulation that optimistically accounts for uncertainty in the Gaussian behavior. To mitigate the excessive optimism of DeePC, we propose a novel distributionally robust control formulation, and provide a convex reformulation allowing for efficient implementation.

Title: Over-the-Air Transmission of Zak-OTFS with Spread Pilots on Sub-THz Communications Testbed
Authors: Claire Parisi, Venkatesh Khammammetti, Robert Calderbank, Lauren Huie
Abstract: Looking towards 6G wireless systems, frequency bands like the sub-terahertz (sub-THz) band (100 GHz - 300 GHz) are gaining traction for their promises of large available swaths of bandwidth to support the ever-growing data demands. However, challenges with harsh channel conditions and hardware nonlinearities in the sub-THz band require robust communication techniques with favorable properties, such as good spectral efficiency and low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Recently, OTFS and its variants have garnered significant attention for their performance in severe conditions (like high delay and Doppler), making it a promising candidate for future communications. In this work, we implement Zak-OTFS for the over-the-air experiments with traditional point pilots and the new spread pilots. Notably, we design our spread-pilot waveforms with communications and sensing coexisting in the same radio resources. We define the system model and the signal design for integration onto our state-of-the-art sub-THz wireless testbed. We show successful data transmission over-the-air at 140 GHz and 240 GHz in a variety of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. In addition, we demonstrate integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) capabilities and show PAPR improvement of over 5 dB with spread pilots compared to point pilots.

Title: Monocular inspection of spacecraft under illumination constraints and avoidance regions
Authors: Tochukwu Elijah Ogri, Muzaffar Qureshi, Zachary I. Bell, Matthew Longmire, Rushikesh Kamalapurkar
Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive control approach to information-based guidance and control of a spacecraft carrying out on-orbit inspection by actively computing optimal policies for the spacecraft to achieve the best possible representation of objects within its orbital environment. Due to the complexity of navigating the space environment, it may be impossible to carry out on-orbit servicing to maintain space systems like satellites using a spacecraft equipped with controllers that cannot adapt to changing conditions. In particular, the presence of constraints such as illumination, field-of-view (FOV), minimal fuel, the use of visual-inertial navigation for improved localization, and the need for real-time computation of control policies render the spacecraft motion planning problem challenging. The control framework developed in this paper addresses these challenges by formulating the inspection task as a constrained optimization problem where the goal is to maximize information gained from the cameras, while navigating to the next best view, subject to illumination and FOV constraints. The developed architecture is analyzed using a Lyapunov-based stability analysis and the effectiveness of the planning algorithm is verified in simulation.

Title: Hessian Riemannian Flow For Multi-Population Wardrop Equilibrium
Authors: Tigran Bakaryan, Christoph Aoun, Ricardo de Lima Ribeiro, Naira Hovakimyan, Diogo Gomes
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of optimizing flows on generalized graphs that feature multiple entry points and multiple populations, each with varying cost structures. We tackle this problem by considering the multi-population Wardrop equilibrium, defined through variational inequalities. We rigorously analyze the existence and uniqueness of the Wardrop equilibrium. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient numerical method to find the solution. In particular, we reformulate the equilibrium problem as a distributed optimization problem over subgraphs and introduce a novel Hessian Riemannian flow method, a Riemannian-manifold-projected Hessian flow, to efficiently compute a solution. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through examples in urban traffic management, including routing for diverse vehicle types and strategies for minimizing emissions in congested environments.

Title: PRIME: Fast Primal-Dual Feedback Optimization for Markets with Application to Optimal Power Flow
Authors: Nicholas Julian Behr, Mattia Bianchi, Keith Moffat, Saverio Bolognani, Florian DÃ¶rfler
Abstract: Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) controllers iteratively drive a plant to an optimal operating point that satisfies input and output constraints, relying solely on the input-output sensitivity as model information. This paper introduces PRIME (PRoximal Iterative MarkEts), a novel OFO approach based on proximal-point iterations. Unlike existing OFO solutions, PRIME admits a market-based implementation, where self-interested actors are incentivized to make choices that result in a safe and efficient operation, without communicating private costs or constraints. Furthermore, PRIME can cope with non-smooth objective functions, achieve fast convergence rates and rapid constraint satisfaction, and reject measurement noise. We demonstrate PRIME on an AC optimal power flow problem, obtaining an efficient real-time nonlinear local marginal pricing scheme.

Title: SLAM-Based Navigation and Fault Resilience in a Surveillance Quadcopter with Embedded Vision Systems
Authors: Abhishek Tyagi, Charu Gaur
Abstract: We present an autonomous aerial surveillance platform, Veg, designed as a fault-tolerant quadcopter system that integrates visual SLAM for GPS-independent navigation, advanced control architecture for dynamic stability, and embedded vision modules for real-time object and face recognition. The platform features a cascaded control design with an LQR inner-loop and PD outer-loop trajectory control. It leverages ORB-SLAM3 for 6-DoF localization and loop closure, and supports waypoint-based navigation through Dijkstra path planning over SLAM-derived maps. A real-time Failure Detection and Identification (FDI) system detects rotor faults and executes emergency landing through re-routing.

Title: Efficient and Safe Planner for Automated Driving on Ramps Considering Unsatisfication
Authors: Qinghao Li, Zhen Tian, Xiaodan Wang, Jinming Yang, Zhihao Lin
Abstract: Automated driving on ramps presents significant challenges due to the need to balance both safety and efficiency during lane changes. This paper proposes an integrated planner for automated vehicles (AVs) on ramps, utilizing an unsatisfactory level metric for efficiency and arrow-cluster-based sampling for safety. The planner identifies optimal times for the AV to change lanes, taking into account the vehicle's velocity as a key factor in efficiency. Additionally, the integrated planner employs arrow-cluster-based sampling to evaluate collision risks and select an optimal lane-changing curve. Extensive simulations were conducted in a ramp scenario to verify the planner's efficient and safe performance. The results demonstrate that the proposed planner can effectively select an appropriate lane-changing time point and a safe lane-changing curve for AVs, without incurring any collisions during the maneuver.

Title: $k$-Inductive and Interpolation-Inspired Barrier Certificates for Stochastic Dynamical Systems
Authors: Mohammed Adib Oumer, Vishnu Murali, Majid Zamani
Abstract: We introduce two notions of barrier certificates that use multiple functions to provide a lower bound on the probabilistic satisfaction of safety for stochastic dynamical systems. A barrier certificate for a stochastic dynamical system acts as a nonnegative supermartingale, and provides a lower bound on the probability that the system is safe. The promise of such certificates is that their search can be effectively automated. Typically, one may use optimization or SMT solvers to find such barrier certificates of a given fixed template. When such approaches fail, a typical approach is to instead change the template. We propose an alternative approach that we dub interpolation-inspired barrier certificates. An interpolation-inspired barrier certificate consists of a set of functions that jointly provide a lower bound on the probability of satisfying safety. We show how one may find such certificates of a fixed template, even when we fail to find standard barrier certificates of the same template. However, we note that such certificates still need to ensure a supermartingale guarantee for one function in the set. To address this challenge, we consider the use of $k$-induction with these interpolation-inspired certificates. The recent use of $k$-induction in barrier certificates allows one to relax the supermartingale requirement at every time step to a combination of a supermartingale requirement every $k$ steps and a $c$-martingale requirement for the intermediate steps. We provide a generic formulation of a barrier certificate that we dub $k$-inductive interpolation-inspired barrier certificate. The formulation allows for several combinations of interpolation and $k$-induction for barrier certificate. We present two examples among the possible combinations. We finally present sum-of-squares programming to synthesize this set of functions and demonstrate their utility in case studies.

Title: MRTA-Sim: A Modular Simulator for Multi-Robot Allocation, Planning, and Control in Open-World Environments
Authors: Victoria Marie Tuck, Hardik Parwana, Pei-Wei Chen, Georgios Fainekos, Bardh Hoxha, Hideki Okamoto, S. Shankar Sastry, Sanjit A. Seshia
Abstract: This paper introduces MRTA-Sim, a Python/ROS2/Gazebo simulator for testing approaches to Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) problems on simulated robots in complex, indoor environments. Grid-based approaches to MRTA problems can be too restrictive for use in complex, dynamic environments such in warehouses, department stores, hospitals, etc. However, approaches that operate in free-space often operate at a layer of abstraction above the control and planning layers of a robot and make an assumption on approximate travel time between points of interest in the system. These abstractions can neglect the impact of the tight space and multi-agent interactions on the quality of the solution. Therefore, MRTA solutions should be tested with the navigation stacks of the robots in mind, taking into account robot planning, conflict avoidance between robots, and human interaction and avoidance. This tool connects the allocation output of MRTA solvers to individual robot planning using the NAV2 stack and local, centralized multi-robot deconfliction using Control Barrier Function-Quadrtic Programs (CBF-QPs), creating a platform closer to real-world operation for more comprehensive testing of these approaches. The simulation architecture is modular so that users can swap out methods at different levels of the stack. We show the use of our system with a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)-based approach to dynamic MRTA on a fleet of indoor delivery robots.

Title: LAPP: Large Language Model Feedback for Preference-Driven Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Pingcheng Jian, Xiao Wei, Yanbaihui Liu, Samuel A. Moore, Michael M. Zavlanos, Boyuan Chen
Abstract: We introduce Large Language Model-Assisted Preference Prediction (LAPP), a novel framework for robot learning that enables efficient, customizable, and expressive behavior acquisition with minimum human effort. Unlike prior approaches that rely heavily on reward engineering, human demonstrations, motion capture, or expensive pairwise preference labels, LAPP leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate preference labels from raw state-action trajectories collected during reinforcement learning (RL). These labels are used to train an online preference predictor, which in turn guides the policy optimization process toward satisfying high-level behavioral specifications provided by humans. Our key technical contribution is the integration of LLMs into the RL feedback loop through trajectory-level preference prediction, enabling robots to acquire complex skills including subtle control over gait patterns and rhythmic timing. We evaluate LAPP on a diverse set of quadruped locomotion and dexterous manipulation tasks and show that it achieves efficient learning, higher final performance, faster adaptation, and precise control of high-level behaviors. Notably, LAPP enables robots to master highly dynamic and expressive tasks such as quadruped backflips, which remain out of reach for standard LLM-generated or handcrafted rewards. Our results highlight LAPP as a promising direction for scalable preference-driven robot learning.

Title: Emergence and Evolution of Interpretable Concepts in Diffusion Models
Authors: Berk Tinaz, Zalan Fabian, Mahdi Soltanolkotabi
Abstract: Diffusion models have become the go-to method for text-to-image generation, producing high-quality images from noise through a process called reverse diffusion. Understanding the dynamics of the reverse diffusion process is crucial in steering the generation and achieving high sample quality. However, the inner workings of diffusion models is still largely a mystery due to their black-box nature and complex, multi-step generation process. Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) techniques, such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), aim at uncovering the operating principles of models through granular analysis of their internal representations. These MI techniques have been successful in understanding and steering the behavior of large language models at scale. However, the great potential of SAEs has not yet been applied toward gaining insight into the intricate generative process of diffusion models. In this work, we leverage the SAE framework to probe the inner workings of a popular text-to-image diffusion model, and uncover a variety of human-interpretable concepts in its activations. Interestingly, we find that even before the first reverse diffusion step is completed, the final composition of the scene can be predicted surprisingly well by looking at the spatial distribution of activated concepts. Moreover, going beyond correlational analysis, we show that the discovered concepts have a causal effect on the model output and can be leveraged to steer the generative process. We design intervention techniques aimed at manipulating image composition and style, and demonstrate that (1) in early stages of diffusion image composition can be effectively controlled, (2) in the middle stages of diffusion image composition is finalized, however stylistic interventions are effective, and (3) in the final stages of diffusion only minor textural details are subject to change.

Title: A Sensor-Driven Optimization Framework for Asset Management in Energy Systems: Implications for Full and Partial Digital Transformation in Hydro Fleets
Authors: Farnaz Fallahi, Murat Yildirim, Shijia Zhao, Feng Qiu
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel prognostics-driven approach to optimize operations and maintenance (O&M) decisions in hydropower systems. Our approach harnesses the insights from sensor data to accurately predict the remaining lifetime distribution of critical generation assets in hydropower systems, i.e., thrust bearings, and use these predictions to optimally schedule O&M actions for a fleet of hydro generators. We consider complex interdependencies across hydro generator failure risks, reservoir, production, and demand management decisions. We propose a stochastic joint O&M scheduling model to tackle the unique challenges of hydropower O&M including the interdependency of generation capacities, the nonlinear nature of power production, operational requirements, and uncertainties. We develop a two-level decomposition-based solution algorithm to effectively handle large-scale cases. The algorithm incorporates a combination of Benders optimality cuts and integer cuts to solve the problem in an efficient manner. We design an experimental framework to evaluate the proposed prognostics-driven O&M scheduling framework, using real-world condition monitoring data from hydropower systems, historical market prices, and water inflow data. The developed framework can be partially implemented for a phased-in approach. Our experiments demonstrate the significant benefits of the sensor-driven O&M framework in improving reliability, availability, effective usage of resources, and system profitability, especially when gradually shifting from traditional time-based maintenance policies to condition-based prognostics-driven maintenance policies.

Title: Fluorescence Reference Target Quantitative Analysis Library
Authors: Eammon A. Littler, Emmanuel A. Mannoh, Ethan P. M. LaRochelle
Abstract: Standardized performance evaluation of fluorescence imaging systems remains a critical unmet need in the field of fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS). While the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) TG311 report and recent FDA draft guidance provide recommended metrics for system characterization, practical tools for extracting these metrics remain limited, inconsistent, and often inaccessible. We present QUEL-QAL, an open-source Python library designed to streamline and standardize the quantitative analysis of fluorescence images using solid reference targets. The library provides a modular, reproducible workflow that includes region of interest (ROI) detection, statistical analysis, and visualization capabilities. QUEL-QAL supports key metrics such as response linearity, limit of detection, depth sensitivity, and spatial resolution, in alignment with regulatory and academic guidance. Built on widely adopted Python packages, the library is designed to be extensible, enabling users to adapt it to novel target designs and analysis protocols. By promoting transparency, reproducibility, and regulatory alignment, QUEL-QAL offers a foundational tool to support standardized benchmarking and accelerate the development and evaluation of fluorescence imaging systems.

Title: SimulS2S-LLM: Unlocking Simultaneous Inference of Speech LLMs for Speech-to-Speech Translation
Authors: Keqi Deng, Wenxi Chen, Xie Chen, Philip C. Woodland
Abstract: Simultaneous speech translation (SST) outputs translations in parallel with streaming speech input, balancing translation quality and latency. While large language models (LLMs) have been extended to handle the speech modality, streaming remains challenging as speech is prepended as a prompt for the entire generation process. To unlock LLM streaming capability, this paper proposes SimulS2S-LLM, which trains speech LLMs offline and employs a test-time policy to guide simultaneous inference. SimulS2S-LLM alleviates the mismatch between training and inference by extracting boundary-aware speech prompts that allows it to be better matched with text input data. SimulS2S-LLM achieves simultaneous speech-to-speech translation (Simul-S2ST) by predicting discrete output speech tokens and then synthesising output speech using a pre-trained vocoder. An incremental beam search is designed to expand the search space of speech token prediction without increasing latency. Experiments on the CVSS speech data show that SimulS2S-LLM offers a better translation quality-latency trade-off than existing methods that use the same training data, such as improving ASR-BLEU scores by 3 points at similar latency.

Title: Research on Navigation Methods Based on LLMs
Authors: Anlong Zhang, Jianmin Ji
Abstract: In recent years, the field of indoor navigation has witnessed groundbreaking advancements through the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs). Traditional navigation approaches relying on pre-built maps or reinforcement learning exhibit limitations such as poor generalization and limited adaptability to dynamic environments. In contrast, LLMs offer a novel paradigm for complex indoor navigation tasks by leveraging their exceptional semantic comprehension, reasoning capabilities, and zero-shot generalization properties. We propose an LLM-based navigation framework that leverages function calling capabilities, positioning the LLM as the central controller. Our methodology involves modular decomposition of conventional navigation functions into reusable LLM tools with expandable configurations. This is complemented by a systematically designed, transferable system prompt template and interaction workflow that can be easily adapted across different implementations. Experimental validation in PyBullet simulation environments across diverse scenarios demonstrates the substantial potential and effectiveness of our approach, particularly in achieving context-aware navigation through dynamic tool composition.

Title: RadioDiff-$k^2$: Helmholtz Equation Informed Generative Diffusion Model for Multi-Path Aware Radio Map Construction
Authors: Xiucheng Wang, Qiming Zhang, Nan Cheng, Ruijin Sun, Zan Li, Shuguang Cui, Xuemin Shen
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel physics-informed generative learning approach, termed RadioDiff-$\bm{k^2}$, for accurate and efficient multipath-aware radio map (RM) construction. As wireless communication evolves towards environment-aware paradigms, driven by the increasing demand for intelligent and proactive optimization in sixth-generation (6G) networks, accurate construction of RMs becomes crucial yet highly challenging. Conventional electromagnetic (EM)-based methods, such as full-wave solvers and ray-tracing approaches, exhibit substantial computational overhead and limited adaptability to dynamic scenarios. Although, existing neural network (NN) approaches have efficient inferencing speed, they lack sufficient consideration of the underlying physics of EM wave propagation, limiting their effectiveness in accurately modeling critical EM singularities induced by complex multipath environments. To address these fundamental limitations, we propose a novel physics-inspired RM construction method guided explicitly by the Helmholtz equation, which inherently governs EM wave propagation. Specifically, we theoretically establish a direct correspondence between EM singularities, which correspond to the critical spatial features influencing wireless propagation, and regions defined by negative wave numbers in the Helmholtz equation. Based on this insight, we design an innovative dual generative diffusion model (DM) framework comprising one DM dedicated to accurately inferring EM singularities and another DM responsible for reconstructing the complete RM using these singularities along with environmental contextual information. Our physics-informed approach uniquely combines the efficiency advantages of data-driven methods with rigorous physics-based EM modeling, significantly enhancing RM accuracy, particularly in complex propagation environments dominated by multipath effects.

Title: Energy-Efficient SIM-assisted Communications: How Many Layers Do We Need?
Authors: Enyu Shi, Jiayi Zhang, Jiancheng An, Marco Di Renzo, Bo Ai, Chau Yuen
Abstract: The stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM), comprising multiple layers of reconfigurable transmissive metasurfaces, is becoming an increasingly viable solution for future wireless communication systems. In this paper, we explore the integration of SIM in a multi-antenna base station for application to downlink multi-user communications, and a realistic power consumption model for SIM-assisted systems is presented. Specifically, we focus on maximizing the energy efficiency (EE) for hybrid precoding design, i.e., the base station digital precoding and SIM wave-based beamforming. Due to the non-convexity and high complexity of the formulated problem, we employ the quadratic transformation method to reformulate the optimization problem and propose an alternating optimization (AO)-based joint precoding framework. Specifically, a successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm is adopted for the base station precoding design. For the SIM wave-based beamforming, two algorithms are employed: the high-performance semidefinite programming (SDP) method and the low-complexity projected gradient ascent (PGA) algorithm. In particular, the results indicate that while the optimal number of SIM layers for maximizing the EE and spectral efficiency differs, a design of 2 to 5 layers can achieve satisfactory performance for both. Finally, numerical results are illustrated to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid precoding framework and to showcase the performance enhancement achieved by the algorithm in comparison to benchmark schemes.

Title: Markov Kernels, Distances and Optimal Control: A Parable of Linear Quadratic Non-Gaussian Distribution Steering
Authors: Alexis M.H. Teter, Wenqing Wang, Sachin Shivakumar, Abhishek Halder
Abstract: For a controllable linear time-varying (LTV) pair $(\boldsymbol{A}_t,\boldsymbol{B}_t)$ and $\boldsymbol{Q}_{t}$ positive semidefinite, we derive the Markov kernel for the ItÃ´ diffusion ${\mathrm{d}}\boldsymbol{x}_{t}=\boldsymbol{A}_{t}\boldsymbol{x}_t {\mathrm{d}} t + \sqrt{2}\boldsymbol{B}_{t}{\mathrm{d}}\boldsymbol{w}_{t}$ with an accompanying killing of probability mass at rate $\frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{x}^{\top}\boldsymbol{Q}_{t}\boldsymbol{x}$. This Markov kernel is the Green's function for an associated linear reaction-advection-diffusion partial differential equation. Our result generalizes the recently derived kernel for the special case $\left(\boldsymbol{A}_t,\boldsymbol{B}_t\right)=\left(\boldsymbol{0},\boldsymbol{I}\right)$, and depends on the solution of an associated Riccati matrix ODE. A consequence of this result is that the linear quadratic non-Gaussian SchrÃ¶dinger bridge is exactly solvable. This means that the problem of steering a controlled LTV diffusion from a given non-Gaussian distribution to another over a fixed deadline while minimizing an expected quadratic cost can be solved using dynamic Sinkhorn recursions performed with the derived kernel. Our derivation for the $\left(\boldsymbol{A}_t,\boldsymbol{B}_t,\boldsymbol{Q}_t\right)$-parametrized kernel pursues a new idea that relies on finding a state-time dependent distance-like functional given by the solution of a deterministic optimal control problem. This technique breaks away from existing methods, such as generalizing Hermite polynomials or Weyl calculus, which have seen limited success in the reaction-diffusion context. Our technique uncovers a new connection between Markov kernels, distances, and optimal control. This connection is of interest beyond its immediate application in solving the linear quadratic SchrÃ¶dinger bridge problem.

Title: DSDNet: Raw Domain DemoirÃ©ing via Dual Color-Space Synergy
Authors: Qirui Yang, Fangpu Zhang, Yeying Jin, Qihua Cheng, Pengtao Jiang, Huanjing Yue, Jingyu Yang
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of mobile imaging, capturing screens using smartphones has become a prevalent practice in distance learning and conference recording. However, moirÃ© artifacts, caused by frequency aliasing between display screens and camera sensors, are further amplified by the image signal processing pipeline, leading to severe visual degradation. Existing sRGB domain demoirÃ©ing methods struggle with irreversible information loss, while recent two-stage raw domain approaches suffer from information bottlenecks and inference inefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a single-stage raw domain demoirÃ©ing framework, Dual-Stream DemoirÃ©ing Network (DSDNet), which leverages the synergy of raw and YCbCr images to remove moirÃ© while preserving luminance and color fidelity. Specifically, to guide luminance correction and moirÃ© removal, we design a raw-to-YCbCr mapping pipeline and introduce the Synergic Attention with Dynamic Modulation (SADM) module. This module enriches the raw-to-sRGB conversion with cross-domain contextual features. Furthermore, to better guide color fidelity, we develop a Luminance-Chrominance Adaptive Transformer (LCAT), which decouples luminance and chrominance representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSDNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and quantitative evaluation, and achieves an inference speed $\mathrm{\textbf{2.4x}}$ faster than the second-best method, highlighting its practical advantages.

Title: Observability conditions for neural state-space models with eigenvalues and their roots of unity
Authors: Andrew Gracyk
Abstract: We operate through the lens of ordinary differential equations and control theory to study the concept of observability in the context of neural state-space models and the Mamba architecture. We develop strategies to enforce observability, which are tailored to a learning context, specifically where the hidden states are learnable at initial time, in conjunction to over its continuum, and high-dimensional. We also highlight our methods emphasize eigenvalues, roots of unity, or both. Our methods effectuate computational efficiency when enforcing observability, sometimes at great scale. We formulate observability conditions in machine learning based on classical control theory and discuss their computational complexity. Our nontrivial results are fivefold. We discuss observability through the use of permutations in neural applications with learnable matrices without high precision. We present two results built upon the Fourier transform that effect observability with high probability up to the randomness in the learning. These results are worked with the interplay of representations in Fourier space and their eigenstructure, nonlinear mappings, and the observability matrix. We present a result for Mamba that is similar to a Hautus-type condition, but instead employs an argument using a Vandermonde matrix instead of eigenvectors. Our final result is a shared-parameter construction of the Mamba system, which is computationally efficient in high exponentiation. We develop a training algorithm with this coupling, showing it satisfies a Robbins-Monro condition under certain orthogonality, while a more classical training procedure fails to satisfy a contraction with high Lipschitz constant.

Title: Quantifying Source Speaker Leakage in One-to-One Voice Conversion
Authors: Scott Wellington, Xuechen Liu, Junichi Yamagishi
Abstract: Using a multi-accented corpus of parallel utterances for use with commercial speech devices, we present a case study to show that it is possible to quantify a degree of confidence about a source speaker's identity in the case of one-to-one voice conversion. Following voice conversion using a HiFi-GAN vocoder, we compare information leakage for a range speaker characteristics; assuming a "worst-case" white-box scenario, we quantify our confidence to perform inference and narrow the pool of likely source speakers, reinforcing the regulatory obligation and moral duty that providers of synthetic voices have to ensure the privacy of their speakers' data.

Title: DERD-Net: Learning Depth from Event-based Ray Densities
Authors: Diego de Oliveira Hitzges, Suman Ghosh, Guillermo Gallego
Abstract: Event cameras offer a promising avenue for multi-view stereo depth estimation and Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) due to their ability to detect blur-free 3D edges at high-speed and over broad illumination conditions. However, traditional deep learning frameworks designed for conventional cameras struggle with the asynchronous, stream-like nature of event data, as their architectures are optimized for discrete, image-like inputs. We propose a scalable, flexible and adaptable framework for pixel-wise depth estimation with event cameras in both monocular and stereo setups. The 3D scene structure is encoded into disparity space images (DSIs), representing spatial densities of rays obtained by back-projecting events into space via known camera poses. Our neural network processes local subregions of the DSIs combining 3D convolutions and a recurrent structure to recognize valuable patterns for depth prediction. Local processing enables fast inference with full parallelization and ensures constant ultra-low model complexity and memory costs, regardless of camera resolution. Experiments on standard benchmarks (MVSEC and DSEC datasets) demonstrate unprecedented effectiveness: (i) using purely monocular data, our method achieves comparable results to existing stereo methods; (ii) when applied to stereo data, it strongly outperforms all state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, reducing the mean absolute error by at least 42%; (iii) our method also allows for increases in depth completeness by more than 3-fold while still yielding a reduction in median absolute error of at least 30%. Given its remarkable performance and effective processing of event-data, our framework holds strong potential to become a standard approach for using deep learning for event-based depth estimation and SLAM.

Title: Continuity Conditions for Piecewise Quadratic Functions on Simplicial Conic Partitions are Equivalent
Authors: Magne Erlandsen, Tomas Meijer, Maurice Heemels, Sebastiaan van den Eijnden
Abstract: Analysis of continuous-time piecewise linear (PWL) systems based on piecewise quadratic (PWQ) Lyapunov functions typically requires continuity of these functions over a partition of the state space. Several conditions for guaranteeing continuity of PWQ functions over state space partitions can be found in the literature. In this technical note, we show that these continuity conditions are equivalent over so-called simplicial conic partitions. A key element in our proof is a technical lemma, which, in addition to being of independent interest, plays a crucial role in demonstrating the equivalence of these conditions. As a consequence, the choice of which condition to impose can be based solely on practical considerations such as specific application or numerical aspects, without introducing additional conservatism in the analysis.

Title: Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Assisted MIMO: Electromagnetic-Compliant Modeling with Mutual Coupling
Authors: Yang Cao, Wenchi Cheng, Jingqing Wang, Wei Zhang
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) represent a transformative technology for sixth-generation (6G) wireless communications, but it suffers from a significant limitation, namely the double-fading attenuation. Active RIS has emerged as a promising solution, effectively mitigating the attenuation issues associated with conventional RIS-assisted systems. However, the current academic work on active RIS focuses on the system-level optimization of active RIS, often overlooking the development of models that are compatible with its electromagnetic (EM) and physical properties. The challenge of constructing realistic, EM-compliant models for active RIS-assisted communication, as well as understanding their implications on system-level optimization, remains an open research area. To tackle these problems, in this paper we develop a novel EM-compliant model with mutual coupling (MC) for active RIS-assisted wireless systems by integrating the developed scattering-parameter ($S$-parameter) based active RIS framework with multiport network theory, which facilitates system-level analysis and optimization. To evaluate the performance of the EM-compliant active RIS model, we design the joint optimization scheme based on the transmit beamforming at the transmitter and the reflection coefficient at the active RIS to maximize the achievable rate of EM-compliant active RIS-assisted MIMO system. To tackle the inherent non-convexity of this problem, we employ the Sherman-Morrison inversion and Neumann series (SMaN)-based alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. Simulation results verified that EM property (i.e., MC effect) is an indispensable factor in the optimization process of MIMO systems. Neglecting this effect introduces a substantial performance gap, highlighting its significance in the more pronounced the MC effect is, the greater the gap in achievable rates.

Title: A UAV-Aided Digital Twin Framework for IoT Networks with High Accuracy and Synchronization
Authors: Ghofran Khalaf, May Itani, Sanaa Sharafeddine
Abstract: With the continued growth of its core technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), Big Data and data analytics, and edge computing, digital twin (DT) technology has witnessed a significant increase in industrial applications, helping the industry become more sustainable, smart, and adaptable. Hence, DT technology has emerged as a promising link between the physical and virtual worlds, enabling simulation, prediction, and real-time performance optimization. This work aims to explore the development of a high-fidelity digital twin framework, focusing on synchronization and accuracy between physical and digital systems to enhance data-driven decision making. To achieve this, we deploy several stationary UAVs in optimized locations to collect data from industrial IoT devices, which were used to monitor multiple physical entities and perform computations to evaluate their status. We consider a practical setup in which multiple IoT devices may monitor a single physical entity, and as a result, the measurements are combined and processed together to determine the status of the physical entity. The resulting status updates are subsequently uploaded from the UAVs to the base station, where the DT resides. In this work, we consider a novel metric based on the Age of Information (AoI), coined as the Age of Digital Twin (AoDT), to reflect the status freshness of the digital twin. Factoring AoDT in the problem formulation ensures that the DT reliably mirrors the physical system with high accuracy and synchronization. We formulate a mixed-integer non-convex program to maximize the total amount of data collected from all IoT devices while ensuring a constrained AoDT. Using successive convex approximations, we solve the problem, conduct extensive simulations and compare the results with baseline approaches to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

Title: Rotational ultrasound and photoacoustic tomography of the human body

Abstract: Imaging the human body's morphological and angiographic information is essential for diagnosing, monitoring, and treating medical conditions. Ultrasonography performs the morphological assessment of the soft tissue based on acoustic impedance variations, whereas photoacoustic tomography (PAT) can visualize blood vessels based on intrinsic hemoglobin absorption. Three-dimensional (3D) panoramic imaging of the vasculature is generally not practical in conventional ultrasonography with limited field-of-view (FOV) probes, and PAT does not provide sufficient scattering-based soft tissue morphological contrast. Complementing each other, fast panoramic rotational ultrasound tomography (RUST) and PAT are integrated for hybrid rotational ultrasound and photoacoustic tomography (RUS-PAT), which obtains 3D ultrasound structural and PAT angiographic images of the human body quasi-simultaneously. The RUST functionality is achieved in a cost-effective manner using a single-element ultrasonic transducer for ultrasound transmission and rotating arc-shaped arrays for 3D panoramic detection. RUST is superior to conventional ultrasonography, which either has a limited FOV with a linear array or is high-cost with a hemispherical array that requires both transmission and receiving. By switching the acoustic source to a light source, the system is conveniently converted to PAT mode to acquire angiographic images in the same region. Using RUS-PAT, we have successfully imaged the human head, breast, hand, and foot with a 10 cm diameter FOV, submillimeter isotropic resolution, and 10 s imaging time for each modality. The 3D RUS-PAT is a powerful tool for high-speed, 3D, dual-contrast imaging of the human body with potential for rapid clinical translation.

Title: Adaptive Fault-tolerant Control of Underwater Vehicles with Thruster Failures
Authors: Haolin Liu, Shiliang Zhang, Shangbin Jiao, Xiaohui Zhang, Xuehui Ma, Yan Yan, Wenchuan Cui, Youmin Zhang
Abstract: This paper presents a fault-tolerant control for the trajectory tracking of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) against thruster failures. We formulate faults in AUV thrusters as discrete switching events during a UAV mission, and develop a soft-switching approach in facilitating shift of control strategies across fault scenarios. We mathematically define AUV thruster fault scenarios, and develop the fault-tolerant control that captures the fault scenario via Bayesian approach. Particularly, when the AUV fault type switches from one to another, the developed control captures the fault states and maintains the control by a linear quadratic tracking controller. With the captured fault states by Bayesian approach, we derive the control law by aggregating the control outputs for individual fault scenarios weighted by their Bayesian posterior probability. The developed fault-tolerant control works in an adaptive way and guarantees soft-switching across fault scenarios, and requires no complicated fault detection dedicated to different type of faults. The entailed soft-switching ensures stable AUV trajectory tracking when fault type shifts, which otherwise leads to reduced control under hard-switching control strategies. We conduct numerical simulations with diverse AUV thruster fault settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed control can provide smooth transition across thruster failures, and effectively sustain AUV trajectory tracking control in case of thruster failures and failure shifts.

Title: A Comparative and Measurement-Based Study on Real-Time Network KPI Extraction Methods for 5G and Beyond Applications
Authors: Batuhan Kaplan, Samed KeÅir, Ahmet Faruk CoÅkun
Abstract: Key performance indicators (KPIs), which can be extracted from the standardized interfaces of network equipment defined by current standards, constitute a primary data source that can be leveraged in the development of non-standardized new equipment, architectures, and computational tools. In next-generation technologies, the demand for data has evolved beyond the conventional log generation or export capabilities provided by existing licensed network monitoring tools. There is now a growing need to collect such data at specific time intervals and with defined granularities. At this stage, the development of real-time KPI extraction methods and enabling their exchange between both standardized/commercialized and non-standardized components or tools has become increasingly critical. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of three distinct KPI extraction methodologies applied to two commercially available devices. The analysis aims to uncover the strengths, weaknesses, and overall efficacy of these approaches under varying conditions, and highlights the critical insights into the practical capabilities and limitations. The findings serve as a foundational guide for the seamless integration and robust testing of novel technologies and approaches within commercial telecommunication networks. This work aspires to bridge the gap between technological innovation and real-world applicability, fostering enhanced decision-making in network deployment and optimization.

Title: A Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method for Efficient Finite-Length LDPC Code Design
Authors: Ata TanrÄ±kulu, Mete YÄ±ldÄ±rÄ±m, Ahmed Hareedy
Abstract: Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are among the most prominent error-correction schemes. They find application to fortify various modern storage, communication, and computing systems. Protograph-based (PB) LDPC codes offer many degrees of freedom in the code design and enable fast encoding and decoding. In particular, spatially-coupled (SC) and multi-dimensional (MD) circulant-based codes are PB-LDPC codes with excellent performance. Efficient finite-length (FL) algorithms are required in order to effectively exploit the available degrees of freedom offered by SC partitioning, lifting, and MD relocations. In this paper, we propose a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC or MC$^2$) method to perform this FL optimization, addressing the removal of short cycles. While iterating, we draw samples from a defined distribution where the probability decreases as the number of short cycles from the previous iteration increases. We analyze our MC$^2$ method theoretically as we prove the invariance of the Markov chain where each state represents a possible partitioning or lifting arrangement. Via our simulations, we then fit the distribution of the number of cycles resulting from a given arrangement on a Gaussian distribution. We derive estimates for cycle counts that are close to the actual counts. Furthermore, we derive the order of the expected number of iterations required by our approach to reach a local minimum as well as the size of the Markov chain recurrent class. Our approach is compatible with code design techniques based on gradient-descent. Numerical results show that our MC$^2$ method generates SC codes with remarkably less number of short cycles compared with the current state-of-the-art. Moreover, to reach the same number of cycles, our method requires orders of magnitude less overall time compared with the available literature methods.

Title: 3DGR-CT: Sparse-View CT Reconstruction with a 3D Gaussian Representation
Authors: Yingtai Li, Xueming Fu, Han Li, Shang Zhao, Ruiyang Jin, S. Kevin Zhou
Abstract: Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) reduces radiation exposure by acquiring fewer projections, making it a valuable tool in clinical scenarios where low-dose radiation is essential. However, this often results in increased noise and artifacts due to limited data. In this paper we propose a novel 3D Gaussian representation (3DGR) based method for sparse-view CT reconstruction. Inspired by recent success in novel view synthesis driven by 3D Gaussian splatting, we leverage the efficiency and expressiveness of 3D Gaussian representation as an alternative to implicit neural representation. To unleash the potential of 3DGR for CT imaging scenario, we propose two key innovations: (i) FBP-image-guided Guassian initialization and (ii) efficient integration with a differentiable CT projector. Extensive experiments and ablations on diverse datasets demonstrate the proposed 3DGR-CT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art counterpart methods, achieving higher reconstruction accuracy with faster convergence. Furthermore, we showcase the potential of 3DGR-CT for real-time physical simulation, which holds important clinical applications while challenging for implicit neural representations.

Title: Facilitating Reinforcement Learning for Process Control Using Transfer Learning: Overview and Perspectives
Authors: Runze Lin, Junghui Chen, Lei Xie, Hongye Su
Abstract: In the context of Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing, the field of process industry optimization and control is also undergoing a digital transformation. With the rise of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), its application in process control has attracted widespread attention. However, the extremely low sample efficiency and the safety concerns caused by exploration in DRL hinder its practical implementation in industrial settings. Transfer learning offers an effective solution for DRL, enhancing its generalization and adaptability in multi-mode control scenarios. This paper provides insights into the use of DRL for process control from the perspective of transfer learning. We analyze the challenges of applying DRL in the process industry and the necessity of introducing transfer learning. Furthermore, recommendations and prospects are provided for future research directions on how transfer learning can be integrated with DRL to enhance process control. This paper aims to offer a set of promising, user-friendly, easy-to-implement, and scalable approaches to artificial intelligence-facilitated industrial control for scholars and engineers in the process industry.

Title: Robust, positive and exact model reduction via monotone matrices
Authors: Marco Cortese, Tommaso Grigoletto, Francesco Ticozzi, Augusto Ferrante
Abstract: This work focuses on the problem of exact model reduction of positive linear systems, by leveraging minimal realization theory. While determining the existence of a positive reachable realization remains in general an open problem, we are able to fully characterize the cases in which the new model is obtained with non-negative reduction matrices, and hence positivity of the reduced model is robust with respect to small perturbations of the original system. The characterization is obtained by specializing monotone matrix theory to positive matrices. In addition, we provide a systematic method to construct positive reductions also when minimal ones are not available, by exploiting algebraic techniques.

Title: EEG Right & Left Voluntary Hand Movement-based Virtual Brain-Computer Interfacing Keyboard Using Hybrid Deep Learning Approach
Authors: Biplov Paneru, Bipul Thapa, Bishwash Paneru, Sanjog Chhetri Sapkota
Abstract: Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs), particularly those based on electroencephalography (EEG), offer promising solutions for assisting individuals with motor disabilities. However, challenges in reliably interpreting EEG signals for specific tasks, such as simulating keystrokes, persist due to the complexity and variability of brain activity. Current EEG-based BMIs face limitations in adaptability, usability, and robustness, especially in applications like virtual keyboards, as traditional machine-learning models struggle to handle high-dimensional EEG data effectively. To address these gaps, we developed an EEG-based BMI system capable of accurately identifying voluntary keystrokes, specifically leveraging right and left voluntary hand movements. Using a publicly available EEG dataset, the signals were pre-processed with band-pass filtering, segmented into 22-electrode arrays, and refined into event-related potential (ERP) windows, resulting in a 19x200 feature array categorized into three classes: resting state (0), 'd' key press (1), and 'l' key press (2). Our approach employs a hybrid neural network architecture with BiGRU-Attention as the proposed model for interpreting EEG signals, achieving superior test accuracy of 90% and a mean accuracy of 91% in 10-fold stratified cross-validation. This performance outperforms traditional ML methods like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Naive Bayes, as well as advanced architectures such as Transformers, CNN-Transformer hybrids, and EEGNet. Finally, the BiGRU-Attention model is integrated into a real-time graphical user interface (GUI) to simulate and predict keystrokes from brain activity. Our work demonstrates how deep learning can advance EEG-based BMI systems by addressing the challenges of signal interpretation and classification.

Title: Movable Antenna-Aided Federated Learning with Over-the-Air Aggregation: Joint Optimization of Positioning, Beamforming, and User Selection
Authors: Yang Zhao, Yue Xiu, Minrui Xu, Ning Wei
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) in wireless computing effectively utilizes communication bandwidth, yet it is vulnerable to errors during the analog aggregation process. While removing users with unfavorable channel conditions can mitigate these errors, it also reduces the available local training data for FL, which in turn hinders the convergence rate of the training process. To tackle this issue, we propose the use of movable antenna (MA) techniques to enhance the degrees of freedom within the channel space, ultimately boosting the convergence speed of FL training. Moreover, we develop a coordinated approach for uplink receiver beamforming, user selection, and MA positioning to optimize the convergence rate of wireless FL training in dynamic wireless environments. This stochastic optimization challenge is reformulated into a mixed-integer programming problem by utilizing the training loss upper bound. We then introduce a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) method to solve the mixed-integer mixed programming problem. Experimental results indicate that incorporating MA techniques significantly accelerates the training convergence of FL and greatly surpasses conventional methods.

Title: Unsupervised Hyperspectral and Multispectral Image Fusion via Self-Supervised Modality Decoupling
Authors: Songcheng Du, Yang Zou, Zixu Wang, Xingyuan Li, Ying Li, Changjing Shang, Qiang Shen
Abstract: Hyperspectral and Multispectral Image Fusion (HMIF) aims to fuse low-resolution hyperspectral images (LR-HSIs) and high-resolution multispectral images (HR-MSIs) to reconstruct high spatial and high spectral resolution images. Current methods typically apply direct fusion from the two modalities without effective supervision, leading to an incomplete perception of deep modality-complementary information and a limited understanding of inter-modality correlations. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective solution for unsupervised HMIF, revealing that modality decoupling is key to improving fusion performance. Specifically, we propose an end-to-end self-supervised \textbf{Mo}dality-Decoupled \textbf{S}patial-\textbf{S}pectral Fusion (\textbf{MossFuse}) framework that decouples shared and complementary information across modalities and aggregates a concise representation of both LR-HSIs and HR-MSIs to reduce modality redundancy. Also, we introduce the subspace clustering loss as a clear guide to decouple modality-shared features from modality-complementary ones. Systematic experiments over multiple datasets demonstrate that our simple and effective approach consistently outperforms the existing HMIF methods while requiring considerably fewer parameters with reduced inference time.

Title: Synthetic Discrete Inertia
Authors: A. Vaca, F. Milano
Abstract: This letter demonstrates how synthetic inertia can be obtained with the control of flexible discrete devices to keep the power balance of power systems, even if the system does not include any synchronous generator or conventional grid-forming converter. The letter also discusses solutions to cycling issues, which can arise due to the interaction of uncoordinated discrete inertia controllers. The effectiveness, dynamic performance, and challenges of the proposed approach are validated through simulations using modified versions of the WSCC 9-bus test system and of the all-island Irish transmission system.

Title: Joint Optimization of Multimodal Transit Frequency and Shared Autonomous Vehicle Fleet Size with Hybrid Metaheuristic and Nonlinear Programming
Authors: Max T.M. Ng, Hani S. Mahmassani, Draco Tong, Omer Verbas, Taner Cokyasar
Abstract: Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) bring competition to traditional transit services but redesigning multimodal transit network can utilize SAVs as feeders to enhance service efficiency and coverage. This paper presents an optimization framework for the joint multimodal transit frequency and SAV fleet size problem, a variant of the transit network frequency setting problem. The objective is to maximize total transit ridership (including SAV-fed trips and subtracting boarding rejections) across multiple time periods under budget constraints, considering endogenous mode choice (transit, point-to-point SAVs, driving) and route selection, while allowing for strategic route removal by setting frequencies to zero. Due to the problem's non-linear, non-convex nature and the computational challenges of large-scale networks, we develop a hybrid solution approach that combines a metaheuristic approach (particle swarm optimization) with nonlinear programming for local solution refinement. To ensure computational tractability, the framework integrates analytical approximation models for SAV waiting times based on fleet utilization, multimodal network assignment for route choice, and multinomial logit mode choice behavior, bypassing the need for computationally intensive simulations within the main optimization loop. Applied to the Chicago metropolitan area's multimodal network, our method illustrates a 33.3% increase in transit ridership through optimized transit route frequencies and SAV integration, particularly enhancing off-peak service accessibility and strategically reallocating resources.

Title: New Paradigm for Unified Near-Field and Far-Field Wireless Communications
Authors: Zhaocheng Wang, Haochen Wu, Yuanbin Chen, Liyang Lu
Abstract: Current Type I and Type II codebooks in fifth generation (5G) wireless communications are limited in supporting the coexistence of far-field and near-field user equipments, as they are exclusively designed for far-field scenarios. To fill this knowledge gap and encourage relevant proposals by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), this article provides a novel codebook to facilitate a unified paradigm for the coexistence of far-field and near-field contexts. It ensures efficient precoding for all user equipments (UEs), while removing the need for the base station to identify whether one specific UE stays in either near-field or far-field regions. Additionally, our proposed codebook ensures compliance with current 3GPP standards for working flow and reference signals. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance and versatility of our proposed codebook, validating its effectiveness in unifying near-field and far-field precoding for sixth-generation (6G) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.

Title: Adaptively Weighted Averaging Over-the-Air Computation and Its Application to Distributed Gaussian Process Regression
Authors: Koya Sato, Koji Ishibashi
Abstract: This paper introduces a noise-tolerant computing method for over-the-air computation (AirComp) aimed at weighted averaging, which is critical in various Internet of Things (IoT) applications such as environmental monitoring. Traditional AirComp approaches, while efficient, suffer significantly in accuracy due to noise enhancement in the normalization by the sum of weights. Our proposed method allows nodes to adaptively truncate their weights based on the channel conditions, thereby enhancing noise tolerance. Applied to distributed Gaussian process regression (D-GPR), the method facilitates low-latency, low-complexity, and high-accuracy distributed regression across a range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We evaluate the performance of the proposed method in a radio map construction problem, which involves visualizing the radio environment based on limited sensing information and spatial interpolation. Numerical results show that our approach maintains computational accuracy in low-SNR scenarios and achieves performance close to ideal conditions in high SNR environments. In addition, a case study targeting a federated learning (FL) system demonstrates the potential of our proposed method in improving model aggregation accuracy, not only for D-GPR but also for FL systems.

Title: Mitigating Traffic Oscillations in Mixed Traffic Flow with Scalable Deep Koopman Predictive Control
Authors: Hao Lyu, Yanyong Guo, Pan Liu, Nan Zheng, Ting Wang, Quansheng Yue
Abstract: The use of connected automated vehicle (CAV) is advocated to mitigate traffic oscillations in mixed traffic flow consisting of CAVs and human driven vehicles (HDVs). This study proposes an adaptive deep Koopman predictive control framework (AdapKoopPC) for regulating mixed traffic flow. Firstly, a Koopman theory-based adaptive trajectory prediction deep network (AdapKoopnet) is designed for modeling HDVs car-following behavior. AdapKoopnet enables the representation of HDVs behavior by a linear model in a high-dimensional space. Secondly, the model predictive control is employed to smooth the mixed traffic flow, where the combination of the linear dynamic model of CAVs and linear prediction blocks from AdapKoopnet is embedded as the predictive model into the AdapKoopPC. Finally, the predictive performance of the prosed AdapKoopnet is verified using the HighD naturalistic driving dataset. Furthermore, the control performance of AdapKoopPC is validated by the numerical simulations. Results demonstrate that the AdapKoopnet provides more accuracy HDVs predicted trajectories than the baseline nonlinear models. Moreover, the proposed AdapKoopPC exhibits more effective control performance with less computation cost compared with baselines in mitigating traffic oscillations, especially at the low CAVs penetration rates. The code of proposed AdapKoopPC is open source.

Title: Model-Free Predictive Control: Introductory Algebraic Calculations, and a Comparison with HEOL and ANNs
Authors: CÃ©dric Join, Emmanuel Delaleau, Michel Fliess
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is a popular control engineering practice, but requires a sound knowledge of the model. Model-free predictive control (MFPC), a burning issue today, also related to reinforcement learning (RL) in AI, is reformulated here via a linear differential equation with constant coefficients, thanks to a new perspective on optimal control combined with recent advances in the field of model-free control (MFC). It is replacing Dynamic Programming, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, and Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. The computing burden is low. The implementation is straightforward. Two nonlinear examples, a chemical reactor and a two tank system, are illustrating our approach. A comparison with the HEOL setting, where some expertise of the process model is needed, shows only a slight superiority of the later. A recent identification of the two tank system via a complex ANN architecture might indicate that a full modeling and the corresponding machine learning mechanism are not always necessary neither in control, nor, more generally, in AI.

Title: Convergent NMPC-based Reinforcement Learning Using Deep Expected Sarsa and Nonlinear Temporal Difference Learning
Authors: Amine Salaje, Thomas Chevet, Nicolas Langlois
Abstract: In this paper, we present a learning-based nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) using an original reinforcement learning (RL) method to learn the optimal weights of the NMPC scheme, for which two methods are proposed. Firstly, the controller is used as the current action-value function of a deep Expected Sarsa where the subsequent action-value function, usually obtained with a secondary NMPC, is approximated with a neural network (NN). With respect to existing methods, we add to the NN's input the current value of the NMPC's learned parameters so that the network is able to approximate the action-value function and stabilize the learning performance. Additionally, with the use of the NN, the real-time computational burden is approximately halved without affecting the closed-loop performance. Secondly, we combine gradient temporal difference methods with a parametrized NMPC as a function approximator of the Expected Sarsa RL method to overcome the potential parameters' divergence and instability issues when nonlinearities are present in the function approximation. The simulation results show that the proposed approach converges to a locally optimal solution without instability problems.

Title: Audio signal interpolation using optimal transportation of spectrograms
Authors: David Valdivia, Marien Renaud, Elsa Cazelles, CÃ©dric FÃ©votte
Abstract: We present a novel approach for generating an artificial audio signal that interpolates between given source and target sounds. Our approach relies on the computation of Wasserstein barycenters of the source and target spectrograms, followed by phase reconstruction and inversion. In contrast with previous works, our new method considers the spectrograms globally and does not operate on a temporal frame-to-frame basis. Another contribution is to endow the transportation cost matrix with a specific structure that prohibits remote displacements of energy along the time axis, and for which optimal transport is made possible by leveraging the unbalanced transport framework. The proposed cost matrix makes sense from the audio perspective and also allows to reduce the computation load. Results with synthetic musical notes and real environmental sounds illustrate the potential of our novel approach.

Title: Finite Sample Analysis of System Poles for Ho-Kalman Algorithm
Authors: Shuai Sun, Xu Wang
Abstract: This paper investigates the error analysis of system pole estimation in $n$-dimensional discrete-time Linear Time-Invariant systems with $m$ outputs and $p$ inputs, using the classical Ho-Kalman algorithm based on finite input-output sample data. Building upon prior work, we establish end-to-end estimation guarantees for system poles under both single-trajectory and multiple-trajectory settings. Specifically, we prove that, with high probability, the estimation error of system poles decreases at a rate of at least $\mathcal{O}\{T^{-\frac{1}{2n}}\}$ in the single-trajectory case and $\mathcal{O}\{N^{-\frac{1}{2n}}\}$ in the multiple-trajectory case, where $T$ is the length of a single trajectory, and $N$ is the number of trajectories. Furthermore, we reveal that in both settings, achieving a constant estimation accuracy for system poles requires the sample size to grow super-polynomially with respect to the larger of the two ratios, $ \max\{n/m, n/p\} $. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the non-asymptotic results of system pole estimation.

Title: Reducing the Communication of Distributed Model Predictive Control: Autoencoders and Formation Control
Authors: Torben Schiz, Henrik Ebel
Abstract: Communication remains a key factor limiting the applicability of distributed model predictive control (DMPC) in realistic settings, despite advances in wireless communication. DMPC schemes can require an overwhelming amount of information exchange between agents as the amount of data depends on the length of the predication horizon, for which some applications require a significant length to formally guarantee nominal asymptotic stability. This work aims to provide an approach to reduce the communication effort of DMPC by reducing the size of the communicated data between agents. Using an autoencoder, the communicated data is reduced by the encoder part of the autoencoder prior to communication and reconstructed by the decoder part upon reception within the distributed optimization algorithm that constitutes the DMPC scheme. The choice of a learning-based reduction method is motivated by structure inherent to the data, which results from the data's connection to solutions of optimal control problems. The approach is implemented and tested at the example of formation control of differential-drive robots, which is challenging for optimization-based control due to the robots' nonholonomic constraints, and which is interesting due to the practical importance of mobile robotics. The applicability of the proposed approach is presented first in form of a simulative analysis showing that the resulting control performance yields a satisfactory accuracy. In particular, the proposed approach outperforms the canonical naive way to reduce communication by reducing the length of the prediction horizon. Moreover, it is shown that numerical experiments conducted on embedded computation hardware, with real distributed computation and wireless communication, work well with the proposed way of reducing communication even in practical scenarios in which full communication fails.

Authors: Guanrou Yang, Chen Yang, Qian Chen, Ziyang Ma, Wenxi Chen, Wen Wang, Tianrui Wang, Yifan Yang, Zhikang Niu, Wenrui Liu, Fan Yu, Zhihao Du, Zhifu Gao, ShiLiang Zhang, Xie Chen
Abstract: Human speech goes beyond the mere transfer of information; it is a profound exchange of emotions and a connection between individuals. While Text-to-Speech (TTS) models have made huge progress, they still face challenges in controlling the emotional expression in the generated speech. In this work, we propose EmoVoice, a novel emotion-controllable TTS model that exploits large language models (LLMs) to enable fine-grained freestyle natural language emotion control, and a phoneme boost variant design that makes the model output phoneme tokens and audio tokens in parallel to enhance content consistency, inspired by chain-of-thought (CoT) and chain-of-modality (CoM) techniques. Besides, we introduce EmoVoice-DB, a high-quality 40-hour English emotion dataset featuring expressive speech and fine-grained emotion labels with natural language descriptions. EmoVoice achieves state-of-the-art performance on the English EmoVoice-DB test set using only synthetic training data, and on the Chinese Secap test set using our in-house data. We further investigate the reliability of existing emotion evaluation metrics and their alignment with human perceptual preferences, and explore using SOTA multimodal LLMs GPT-4o-audio and Gemini to assess emotional speech. Demo samples are available at this https URL. Dataset, code, and checkpoints will be released.

Title: Radar Code Design for the Joint Optimization of Detection Performance and Measurement Accuracy in Track Maintenance
Authors: Tao Fan, Augusto Aubry, Vincenzo Carotenuto, Antonio De Maio, Xianxiang Yu, Guolong Cui
Abstract: This paper deals with the design of slow-time coded waveforms which jointly optimize the detection probability and the measurements accuracy for track maintenance in the presence of colored Gaussian interference. The output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and CramÃ©r Rao bounds (CRBs) on time delay and Doppler shift are used as figures of merit to accomplish reliable detection as well as accurate measurements. The transmitted code is subject to radar power budget requirements and a similarity constraint. To tackle the resulting non-convex multi-objective optimization problem, a polynomial-time algorithm that integrates scalarization and tensor-based relaxation methods is developed. The corresponding relaxed multi-linear problems are solved by means of the maximum block improvement (MBI) framework, where the optimal solution at each iteration is obtained in closed form. Numeral results demonstrate the trade-off between the detection and the estimation performance, along with the acceptable Doppler robustness achieved by the proposed algorithm.

Title: Considerations on the Design of Transceivers for Ambient Internet of Things
Authors: Yuxiao Zhao, Zhen Shen, Shiyu Li, Jing Feng, Hao Min
Abstract: The Ambient IoT (A-IoT) will introduce trillions of connections and enable low-cost battery-less devices. The A-IoT nodes can achieve low cost ($\sim\$ 0.1$ like RFID tag), sub-1mW average power consumption, $\leq 10$ kbps data rates, maintenance-free working for decades, cm-scale size, and support applications like supply chain and smart agriculture. The transceiver challenges in A-IoT focus on sub-mW receivers and crystal-less clock generation. The paper proposes an approximate low-IF receiver and carrier-auxiliary IF feedback LO synthesizer architecture for Type-B/C A-IoT devices, which tracks the RF carrier frequency and eliminates external crystals. The proposed receiver and LO generator are implemented using 55nm CMOS technology. After locking the LO calibration loop, the receiver sensitivity is better than -88 dBm. The proposed receiver architecture will promote zero-power devices for ubiquitous IoT connectivity, bridging digital and physical worlds.

Title: EMelodyGen: Emotion-Conditioned Melody Generation in ABC Notation with the Musical Feature Template
Authors: Monan Zhou, Xiaobing Li, Feng Yu, Wei Li
Abstract: The EMelodyGen system focuses on emotional melody generation in ABC notation controlled by the musical feature template. Owing to the scarcity of well-structured and emotionally labeled sheet music, we designed a template for controlling emotional melody generation by statistical correlations between musical features and emotion labels derived from small-scale emotional symbolic music datasets and music psychology conclusions. We then automatically annotated a large, well-structured sheet music collection with rough emotional labels by the template, converted them into ABC notation, and reduced label imbalance by data augmentation, resulting in a dataset named Rough4Q. Our system backbone pre-trained on Rough4Q can achieve up to 99% music21 parsing rate and melodies generated by our template can lead to a 91% alignment on emotional expressions in blind listening tests. Ablation studies further validated the effectiveness of the feature controls in the template. Available code and demos are at this https URL.

Title: Evolutionary Games on Infinite Strategy Sets: Convergence to Nash Equilibria via Dissipativity
Authors: Brendon G. Anderson, Jingqi Li, Somayeh Sojoudi, Murat Arcak
Abstract: We consider evolutionary dynamics for population games in which players have a continuum of strategies at their disposal. Models in this setting amount to infinite-dimensional differential equations evolving on the manifold of probability measures. We generalize dissipativity theory for evolutionary games from finite to infinite strategy sets that are compact metric spaces, and derive sufficient conditions for the stability of Nash equilibria under the infinite-dimensional dynamics. The resulting analysis is applicable to a broad class of evolutionary games, and is modular in the sense that the pertinent conditions on the dynamics and the game's payoff structure can be verified independently. By specializing our theory to the class of monotone games, we recover as special cases existing stability results for the Brown-von Neumann-Nash and impartial pairwise comparison dynamics. We also extend our theory to models with dynamic payoffs, further broadening the applicability of our framework. Throughout our analyses, we identify and elaborate on new technical conditions that are key in extending dissipativity theory from finite to infinite strategy sets, such as compactness of the set of Nash equilibria and evolution of dynamic payoffs within a compact positively invariant set. We illustrate our theory using a variety of case studies, including a novel, continuous variant of the war of attrition game.

Authors: Yui Lo, Yuqian Chen, Dongnan Liu, Wan Liu, Leo Zekelman, Fan Zhang, Yogesh Rathi, Nikos Makris, Alexandra J. Golby, Weidong Cai, Lauren J. O'Donnell
Abstract: Shape plays an important role in computer graphics, offering informative features to convey an object's morphology and functionality. Shape analysis in brain imaging can help interpret structural and functionality correlations of the human brain. In this work, we investigate the shape of the brain's 3D white matter connections and its potential predictive relationship to human cognitive function. We reconstruct brain connections as sequences of 3D points using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) tractography. To describe each connection, we extract 12 shape descriptors in addition to traditional dMRI connectivity and tissue microstructure features. We introduce a novel framework, Shape--fused Fiber Cluster Transformer (SFFormer), that leverages a multi-head cross-attention feature fusion module to predict subject-specific language performance based on dMRI tractography. We assess the performance of the method on a large dataset including 1065 healthy young adults. The results demonstrate that both the transformer-based SFFormer model and its inter/intra feature fusion with shape, microstructure, and connectivity are informative, and together, they improve the prediction of subject-specific language performance scores. Overall, our results indicate that the shape of the brain's connections is predictive of human language function.

Title: Listenable Maps for Zero-Shot Audio Classifiers
Authors: Francesco Paissan, Luca Della Libera, Mirco Ravanelli, Cem Subakan
Abstract: Interpreting the decisions of deep learning models, including audio classifiers, is crucial for ensuring the transparency and trustworthiness of this technology. In this paper, we introduce LMAC-ZS (Listenable Maps for Audio Classifiers in the Zero-Shot context), which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first decoder-based post-hoc interpretation method for explaining the decisions of zero-shot audio classifiers. The proposed method utilizes a novel loss function that maximizes the faithfulness to the original similarity between a given text-and-audio pair. We provide an extensive evaluation using the Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP) model to showcase that our interpreter remains faithful to the decisions in a zero-shot classification context. Moreover, we qualitatively show that our method produces meaningful explanations that correlate well with different text prompts.

Title: Online Multi-Task Offloading for Semantic-Aware Edge Computing Systems
Authors: Xuyang Chen, Daquan Feng, Wei Jiang, Qu Luo, Gaojie Chen, Yao Sun
Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) provides low-latency offloading solutions for computationally intensive tasks, effectively improving the computing efficiency and battery life of mobile devices. However, for data-intensive tasks or scenarios with limited uplink bandwidth, network congestion might occur due to massive simultaneous offloading nodes, increasing transmission latency and affecting task performance. In this paper, we propose a semantic-aware multi-modal task offloading framework to address the challenges posed by limited uplink bandwidth. By introducing a semantic extraction factor, we balance the relationship among transmission latency, computation energy consumption, and task performance. To measure the offloading performance of multi-modal tasks, we design a unified and fair quality of experience (QoE) metric that includes execution latency, energy consumption, and task performance. Lastly, we formulate the optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and exploit the multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) reinforcement learning algorithm to jointly optimize the semantic extraction factor, communication resources, and computing resources to maximize overall QoE. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a reduction in execution latency and energy consumption of 18.1% and 12.9%, respectively compared with the semantic-unaware approach. Moreover, the proposed approach can be easily extended to models with different user preferences.

Title: Time-Varying Soft-Maximum Barrier Functions for Safety in Unmapped and Dynamic Environments
Authors: Amirsaeid Safari, Jesse B. Hoagg
Abstract: We present a closed-form optimal feedback control method that ensures safety in an a prior unknown and potentially dynamic environment. This article considers the scenario where local perception data (e.g., LiDAR) is obtained periodically, and this data can be used to construct a local control barrier function (CBF) that models a local set that is safe for a period of time into the future. Then, we use a smooth time-varying soft-maximum function to compose the N most recently obtained local CBFs into a single barrier function that models an approximate union of the N most recently obtained local sets. This composite barrier function is used in a constrained quadratic optimization, which is solved in closed form to obtain a safe-and-optimal feedback control. We also apply the time-varying soft-maximum barrier function control to 2 robotic systems (nonholonomic ground robot with nonnegligible inertia, and quadrotor robot), where the objective is to navigate an a priori unknown environment safely and reach a target destination. In these applications, we present a simple approach to generate local CBFs from periodically obtained perception data.

Title: Multimodal Laryngoscopic Video Analysis for Assisted Diagnosis of Vocal Fold Paralysis
Authors: Yucong Zhang, Xin Zou, Jinshan Yang, Wenjun Chen, Juan Liu, Faya Liang, Ming Li
Abstract: This paper presents the Multimodal Laryngoscopic Video Analyzing System (MLVAS), a novel system that leverages both audio and video data to automatically extract key video segments and metrics from raw laryngeal videostroboscopic videos for assisted clinical assessment. The system integrates video-based glottis detection with an audio keyword spotting method to analyze both video and audio data, identifying patient vocalizations and refining video highlights to ensure optimal inspection of vocal fold movements. Beyond key video segment extraction from the raw laryngeal videos, MLVAS is able to generate effective audio and visual features for Vocal Fold Paralysis (VFP) detection. Pre-trained audio encoders are utilized to encode the patient voice to get the audio features. Visual features are generated by measuring the angle deviation of both the left and right vocal folds to the estimated glottal midline on the segmented glottis masks. To get better masks, we introduce a diffusion-based refinement that follows traditional U-Net segmentation to reduce false positives. We conducted several ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of each module and modalities in the proposed MLVAS. The experimental results on a public segmentation dataset show the effectiveness of our proposed segmentation module. In addition, unilateral VFP classification results on a real-world clinic dataset demonstrate MLVAS's ability of providing reliable and objective metrics as well as visualization for assisted clinical diagnosis.

Abstract: This study focuses on identifying the most effective pre-trained model for land use classification in onboard satellite processing, emphasizing achieving high accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness against noisy data conditions commonly encountered during satellite-based inference. Through extensive experimentation, we compare the performance of traditional CNN-based, ResNet-based, and various pre-trained vision Transformer models. Our findings demonstrate that pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) models, particularly MobileViTV2 and EfficientViT-M2, outperform models trained from scratch in terms of accuracy and efficiency. These models achieve high performance with reduced computational requirements and exhibit greater resilience during inference under noisy conditions. While MobileViTV2 has excelled on clean validation data, EfficientViT-M2 has proved more robust when handling noise, making it the most suitable model for onboard satellite EO tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that EfficientViT-M2 is the optimal choice for reliable and efficient RS-IC in satellite operations, achieving 98.76 % of accuracy, precision, and recall. Precisely, EfficientViT-M2 delivers the highest performance across all metrics, excels in training efficiency (1,000s) and inference time (10s), and demonstrates greater robustness (overall robustness score of 0.79). Consequently, EfficientViT-M2 consumes 63.93 % less power than MobileViTV2 (79.23 W) and 73.26 % less power than SwinTransformer (108.90 W). This highlights its significant advantage in energy efficiency.

Abstract: Peer-to-peer learning is an increasingly popular framework that enables beyond-5G distributed edge devices to collaboratively train deep neural networks in a privacy-preserving manner without the aid of a central server. Neural network training algorithms for emerging environments, e.g., smart cities, have many design considerations that are difficult to tune in deployment settings -- such as neural network architectures and hyperparameters. This presents a critical need for characterizing the training dynamics of distributed optimization algorithms used to train highly nonconvex neural networks in peer-to-peer learning environments. In this work, we provide an explicit characterization of the learning dynamics of wide neural networks trained using popular distributed gradient descent (DGD) algorithms. Our results leverage both recent advancements in neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory and extensive previous work on distributed learning and consensus. We validate our analytical results by accurately predicting the parameter and error dynamics of wide neural networks trained for classification tasks.

Title: Semi-Supervised Self-Learning Enhanced Music Emotion Recognition
Authors: Yifu Sun, Xulong Zhang, Monan Zhou, Wei Li
Abstract: Music emotion recognition (MER) aims to identify the emotions conveyed in a given musical piece. However, currently, in the field of MER, the available public datasets have limited sample sizes. Recently, segment-based methods for emotion-related tasks have been proposed, which train backbone networks on shorter segments instead of entire audio clips, thereby naturally augmenting training samples without requiring additional resources. Then, the predicted segment-level results are aggregated to obtain the entire song prediction. The most commonly used method is that the segment inherits the label of the clip containing it, but music emotion is not constant during the whole clip. Doing so will introduce label noise and make the training easy to overfit. To handle the noisy label issue, we propose a semi-supervised self-learning (SSSL) method, which can differentiate between samples with correct and incorrect labels in a self-learning manner, thus effectively utilizing the augmented segment-level data. Experiments on three public emotional datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve better or comparable performance.

Title: WhisperFlow: speech foundation models in real time
Authors: Rongxiang Wang, Zhiming Xu, Felix Xiaozhu Lin
Abstract: Speech foundation models, such as OpenAI's Whisper, become the state of the art in speech understanding due to their strong accuracy and generalizability. Yet, their applications are mostly limited to processing pre-recorded speech, whereas processing of streaming speech, in particular doing it efficiently, remains rudimentary. Behind this inefficiency are multiple fundamental reasons: (1) speech foundation models are trained to process long, fixed-length voice inputs (often 30 seconds); (2) encoding each voice input requires encoding as many as 1,500 tokens with tens of transformer layers; (3) decoding each output entails an irregular, complex beam search. As such, streaming speech processing on resource-constrained client devices is more expensive than other AI tasks, e.g., text generation. To this end, we present a novel framework, WhisperFlow, which embodies both model and system optimizations. (1) Hush word as a short, learnable audio segment; appended to a voice input, a hush word gracefully stops the speech model from processing more input without hallucination; (2) Beam pruning, which aligns streaming audio buffers over time and reuses results from earlier decoding rounds, therefore significantly accelerating decoding; and (3) CPU/GPU pipelining, which not only maps to the encoding/decoding stages dynamically, but also tunes to an optimal resource ratio, respecting the encoding/decoding speed that varies across voice inputs, models, and hardware. We test WhisperFlow on commodity ARM platforms with 4-12 CPU cores and 10-30 GPU cores. It reduces per-word latency by 1.6x-4.7x to as low as 0.5 second, while seeing negligible accuracy degradation. On an entry-level MacBook Air, WhisperFlow can keep the per-word latency around 1 second, with the whole device drawing only 7 Watts in total.

Title: Fine-tuning Whisper on Low-Resource Languages for Real-World Applications
Authors: Vincenzo Timmel, Claudio Paonessa, Reza Kakooee, Manfred Vogel, Daniel Perruchoud
Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to fine-tuning OpenAI's Whisper model for low-resource languages by introducing a novel data generation method that converts sentence-level data into a long-form corpus, using Swiss German as a case study. Non-sentence-level data, which could improve the performance of long-form audio, is difficult to obtain and often restricted by copyright laws. Our method bridges this gap by transforming more accessible sentence-level data into a format that preserves the model's ability to handle long-form audio and perform segmentation without requiring non-sentence-level data. Our data generation process improves performance in several real-world applications and leads to the development of a new state-of-the-art speech-to-text (STT) model for Swiss German. We compare our model with a non-fine-tuned Whisper and our previous state-of-the-art Swiss German STT models, where our new model achieves higher BLEU scores. Our results also indicate that the proposed method is adaptable to other low-resource languages, supported by written guidance and code that allows the creation of fine-tuned Whisper models, which keep segmentation capabilities and allow the transcription of longer audio files using only sentence-level data with high quality.

Title: Orthogonal projection-based regularization for efficient model augmentation
Authors: BendegÃºz M. GyÃ¶rÃ¶k, Jan H. Hoekstra, Johan Kon, TamÃ¡s PÃ©ni, Maarten Schoukens, Roland TÃ³th
Abstract: Deep-learning-based nonlinear system identification has shown the ability to produce reliable and highly accurate models in practice. However, these black-box models lack physical interpretability, and a considerable part of the learning effort is often spent on capturing already expected/known behavior of the system, that can be accurately described by first-principles laws of physics. A potential solution is to directly integrate such prior physical knowledge into the model structure, combining the strengths of physics-based modeling and deep-learning-based identification. The most common approach is to use an additive model augmentation structure, where the physics-based and the machine-learning (ML) components are connected in parallel, i.e., additively. However, such models are overparametrized, training them is challenging, potentially causing the physics-based part to lose interpretability. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes an orthogonal projection-based regularization technique to enhance parameter learning and even model accuracy in learning-based augmentation of nonlinear baseline models.

Title: Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Resource Allocation in Optical Networks: Hype or Hope?
Authors: Michael Doherty, Robin Matzner, Rasoul Sadeghi, Polina Bayvel, Alejandra Beghelli
Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamic resource allocation in optical networks has been the focus of intense research activity in recent years, with almost 100 peer-reviewed papers. We present a review of progress in the field, and identify significant gaps in benchmarking practices and reproducibility. To determine the strongest benchmark algorithms, we systematically evaluate several heuristics across diverse network topologies. We find that path count and sort criteria for path selection significantly affect the benchmark performance. We meticulously recreate the problems from five landmark papers and apply the improved benchmarks. Our comparisons demonstrate that simple heuristics consistently match or outperform the published RL solutions, often with an order of magnitude lower blocking probability. Furthermore, we present empirical lower bounds on network blocking using a novel defragmentation-based method, revealing that potential improvements over the benchmark heuristics are limited to 19-36% increased traffic load for the same blocking performance in our examples. We make our simulation framework and results publicly available to promote reproducible research and standardized evaluation this https URL.

Title: Learning Actionable World Models for Industrial Process Control
Authors: Peng Yan, Ahmed Abdulkadir, Gerrit A. Schatte, Giulia Aguzzi, Joonsu Gha, Nikola Pascher, Matthias Rosenthal, Yunlong Gao, Benjamin F. Grewe, Thilo Stadelmann
Abstract: To go from (passive) process monitoring to active process control, an effective AI system must learn about the behavior of the complex system from very limited training data, forming an ad-hoc digital twin with respect to process inputs and outputs that captures the consequences of actions on the process's world. We propose a novel methodology based on learning world models that disentangles process parameters in the learned latent representation, allowing for fine-grained control. Representation learning is driven by the latent factors influencing the processes through contrastive learning within a joint embedding predictive architecture. This makes changes in representations predictable from changes in inputs and vice versa, facilitating interpretability of key factors responsible for process variations, paving the way for effective control actions to keep the process within operational bounds. The effectiveness of our method is validated on the example of plastic injection molding, demonstrating practical relevance in proposing specific control actions for a notoriously unstable process.

Title: F5R-TTS: Improving Flow-Matching based Text-to-Speech with Group Relative Policy Optimization
Authors: Xiaohui Sun, Ruitong Xiao, Jianye Mo, Bowen Wu, Qun Yu, Baoxun Wang
Abstract: We present F5R-TTS, a novel text-to-speech (TTS) system that integrates Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into a flow-matching based architecture. By reformulating the deterministic outputs of flow-matching TTS into probabilistic Gaussian distributions, our approach enables seamless integration of reinforcement learning algorithms. During pretraining, we train a probabilistically reformulated flow-matching based model which is derived from F5-TTS with an open-source dataset. In the subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) phase, we employ a GRPO-driven enhancement stage that leverages dual reward metrics: word error rate (WER) computed via automatic speech recognition and speaker similarity (SIM) assessed by verification models. Experimental results on zero-shot voice cloning demonstrate that F5R-TTS achieves significant improvements in both speech intelligibility (a 29.5% relative reduction in WER) and speaker similarity (a 4.6% relative increase in SIM score) compared to conventional flow-matching based TTS systems.

Title: VocalNet: Speech LLM with Multi-Token Prediction for Faster and High-Quality Generation
Authors: Yuhao Wang, Heyang Liu, Ziyang Cheng, Ronghua Wu, Qunshan Gu, Yanfeng Wang, Yu Wang
Abstract: Speech large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a prominent research focus in speech processing. We introduce VocalNet-1B and VocalNet-8B, a series of high-performance, low-latency speech LLMs enabled by a scalable and model-agnostic training framework designed for real-time voice interaction. Central to our contribution is the first application of multi-token prediction (MTP) to speech LLMs. This approach represents a paradigm shift from standard next-token prediction (NTP), offering simultaneous improvements in generation speed and quality. Informed by analysis of MTP's effect on speech generation and experimental comparisons, we designed a straightforward and highly effective MTP implementation. Experiments demonstrate that VocalNet performs on par with mainstream Omni LLMs even with limited training data, and significantly surpasses existing open-source speech LLMs. To foster reproducibility and community advancement, all model weights, inference code, training data, and framework implementations have been made publicly available at this https URL

Title: Optimal Bayesian Affine Estimator and Active Learning for the Wiener Model
Authors: Sasan Vakili, Manuel Mazo Jr., Peyman Mohajerin Esfahani
Abstract: This paper presents a Bayesian estimation framework for Wiener models, focusing on learning nonlinear output functions under known linear state dynamics. We derive a closed-form optimal affine estimator for the unknown parameters, characterized by the so-called "dynamic basis statistics" (DBS). Several features of the proposed estimator are studied, including Bayesian unbiasedness, closed-form posterior statistics, error monotonicity in trajectory length, and consistency condition (also known as persistent excitation). In the special case of Fourier basis functions, we demonstrate that the closed-form description is computationally available, as the Fourier DBS enjoys explicit expressions. Furthermore, we identify an inherent inconsistency in the Fourier bases for single-trajectory measurements, regardless of the input excitation. Leveraging the closed-form estimation error, we develop an active learning algorithm synthesizing input signals to minimize estimation error. Numerical experiments validate the efficacy of our approach, showing significant improvements over traditional regularized least-squares methods.

Title: PIDSR: Complementary Polarized Image Demosaicing and Super-Resolution
Authors: Shuangfan Zhou, Chu Zhou, Youwei Lyu, Heng Guo, Zhanyu Ma, Boxin Shi, Imari Sato
Abstract: Polarization cameras can capture multiple polarized images with different polarizer angles in a single shot, bringing convenience to polarization-based downstream tasks. However, their direct outputs are color-polarization filter array (CPFA) raw images, requiring demosaicing to reconstruct full-resolution, full-color polarized images; unfortunately, this necessary step introduces artifacts that make polarization-related parameters such as the degree of polarization (DoP) and angle of polarization (AoP) prone to error. Besides, limited by the hardware design, the resolution of a polarization camera is often much lower than that of a conventional RGB camera. Existing polarized image demosaicing (PID) methods are limited in that they cannot enhance resolution, while polarized image super-resolution (PISR) methods, though designed to obtain high-resolution (HR) polarized images from the demosaicing results, tend to retain or even amplify errors in the DoP and AoP introduced by demosaicing artifacts. In this paper, we propose PIDSR, a joint framework that performs complementary Polarized Image Demosaicing and Super-Resolution, showing the ability to robustly obtain high-quality HR polarized images with more accurate DoP and AoP from a CPFA raw image in a direct manner. Experiments show our PIDSR not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real data, but also facilitates downstream tasks.

Title: Location-Oriented Sound Event Localization and Detection with Spatial Mapping and Regression Localization
Authors: Xueping Zhang, Yaxiong Chen, Ruilin Yao, Yunfei Zi, Shengwu Xiong
Abstract: Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) combines the Sound Event Detection (SED) with the corresponding Direction Of Arrival (DOA). Recently, adopted event oriented multi-track methods affect the generality in polyphonic environments due to the limitation of the number of tracks. To enhance the generality in polyphonic environments, we propose Spatial Mapping and Regression Localization for SELD (SMRL-SELD). SMRL-SELD segments the 3D spatial space, mapping it to a 2D plane, and a new regression localization loss is proposed to help the results converge toward the location of the corresponding event. SMRL-SELD is location-oriented, allowing the model to learn event features based on orientation. Thus, the method enables the model to process polyphonic sounds regardless of the number of overlapping events. We conducted experiments on STARSS23 and STARSS22 datasets and our proposed SMRL-SELD outperforms the existing SELD methods in overall evaluation and polyphony environments.

Title: Efficient algorithms for the Hadamard decomposition
Authors: Samuel Wertz, Arnaud Vandaele, Nicolas Gillis
Abstract: The Hadamard decomposition is a powerful technique for data analysis and matrix compression, which decomposes a given matrix into the element-wise product of two or more low-rank matrices. In this paper, we develop an efficient algorithm to solve this problem, leveraging an alternating optimization approach that decomposes the global non-convex problem into a series of convex sub-problems. To improve performance, we explore advanced initialization strategies inspired by the singular value decomposition (SVD) and incorporate acceleration techniques by introducing momentum-based updates. Beyond optimizing the two-matrix case, we also extend the Hadamard decomposition framework to support more than two low-rank matrices, enabling approximations with higher effective ranks while preserving computational efficiency. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to compare our method with the existing gradient descent-based approaches for the Hadamard decomposition and with traditional low-rank approximation techniques. The results highlight the effectiveness of our proposed method across diverse datasets.

Title: How competitive are pay-as-bid auction games?
Authors: Martina Vanelli, Giacomo Como, Fabio Fagnani
Abstract: We study the pay-as-bid auction game, a supply function model with discriminatory pricing and asymmetric firms. In this game, strategies are non-decreasing supply functions relating pric to quantity and the exact choice of the strategy space turns out to be a crucial issue: when it includes all non-decreasing continuous functions, pure-strategy Nash equilibria often fail to exist. To overcome this, we restrict the strategy space to the set of Lipschitz-continuous functions and we prove that Nash equilibria always exist (under standard concavity assumptions) and consist of functions that are affine on their own support and have slope equal to the maximum allowed Lipschitz constant. We further show that the Nash equilibrium is unique up to the market-clearing price when the demand is affine and the asymmetric marginal production costs are homogeneous in zero. For quadratic production costs, we derive a closed-form expression and we compute the limit as the allowed Lipschitz constant grows to infinity. Our results show that in the limit the pay-as-bid auction game achieves perfect competition with efficient allocation and induces a lower market-clearing price compared to supply function models based on uniform price auctions.

Title: Feedback Stackelberg-Nash equilibria in difference games with quasi-hierarchical interactions and inequality constraints
Authors: Partha Sarathi Mohapatra, Puduru Viswanadha Reddy, Georges Zaccour
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of two-player deterministic finite-horizon difference games with coupled inequality constraints, where each player has two types of decision variables: one involving sequential interactions and the other simultaneous interactions. We refer to this class of games as quasi-hierarchical dynamic games and define a solution concept called the feedback Stackelberg-Nash (FSN) equilibrium. Under separability assumption on cost functions, we provide a recursive formulation of the FSN solution using dynamic programming. We show that the FSN solution can be derived from the parametric feedback Stackelberg solution of an associated unconstrained game involving only sequential interactions, with a specific choice of the parameters that satisfy certain implicit complementarity conditions. For the linear-quadratic case, we show that an FSN solution is obtained by reformulating these complementarity conditions as a single large-scale linear complementarity problem. Finally, we illustrate our results using a dynamic duopoly game with production constraints.
