Title: Unsupervised Learning-Based Joint Resource Allocation and Beamforming Design for RIS-Assisted MISO-OFDMA Systems
Authors: Yu Ma, Xingyu Zhou, Xiao Li, Le Liang, Shi Jin
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) are key enablers for 6G wireless systems. This paper studies downlink transmission in an RIS-assisted MISO-OFDMA system, addressing resource allocation challenges. A two-stage unsupervised learning-based framework is proposed to jointly design RIS phase shifts, BS beamforming, and resource block (RB) allocation. The framework includes BeamNet, which predicts RIS phase shifts from CSI, and AllocationNet, which allocates RBs using equivalent CSI derived from BeamNet outputs. Active beamforming is implemented via maximum ratio transmission and water-filling. To handle discrete constraints while ensuring differentiability, quantization and the Gumbel-softmax trick are adopted. A customized loss and phased training enhance performance under QoS constraints. Simulations show the method achieves 99.93% of the sum rate of the SCA baseline with only 0.036% of its runtime, and it remains robust across varying channel and user conditions.

Title: Microelectrode Signal Dynamics as Biomarkers of Subthalamic Nucleus Entry on Deep Brain Stimulation: A Nonlinear Feature Approach
Authors: Ana Luiza S. Tavares, Artur Pedro M. Neto, Francinaldo L. Gomes, Paul Rodrigo dos Reis, Arthur G. da Silva, Antonio P. Junior, Bruno D. Gomes
Abstract: Accurate intraoperative localization of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is essential for the efficacy of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in patients with Parkinson's disease. While microelectrode recordings (MERs) provide rich electrophysiological information during DBS electrode implantation, current localization practices often rely on subjective interpretation of signal features. In this study, we propose a quantitative framework that leverages nonlinear dynamics and entropy-based metrics to classify neural activity recorded inside versus outside the STN. MER data from three patients were preprocessed using a robust artifact correction pipeline, segmented, and labelled based on surgical annotations. A comprehensive set of recurrence quantification analysis, nonlinear, and entropy features were extracted from each segment. Multiple supervised classifiers were trained on every combination of feature domains using stratified 10-fold cross-validation, followed by statistical comparison using paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Holm-Bonferroni correction. The combination of entropy and nonlinear features yielded the highest discriminative power, and the Extra Trees classifier emerged as the best model with a cross-validated F1-score of 0.902+/-0.027 and ROC AUC of 0.887+/-0.055. Final evaluation on a 20% hold-out test set confirmed robust generalization (F1= 0.922, ROC AUC = 0.941). These results highlight the potential of nonlinear and entropy signal descriptors in supporting real-time, data-driven decision-making during DBS surgeries

Title: Data Normalization Strategies for EEG Deep Learning
Authors: Dung Truong, Arnaud Delorme
Abstract: Normalization is a critical yet often overlooked component in the preprocessing pipeline for EEG deep learning applications. The rise of large-scale pretraining paradigms such as self-supervised learning (SSL) introduces a new set of tasks whose nature is substantially different from supervised training common in EEG deep learning applications. This raises new questions about optimal normalization strategies for the applicable task. In this study, we systematically evaluate the impact of normalization granularity (recording vs. window level) and scope (cross-channel vs. within-channel) on both supervised (age and gender prediction) and self-supervised (Contrastive Predictive Coding) tasks. Using high-density resting-state EEG from 2,836 subjects in the Healthy Brain Network dataset, we show that optimal normalization strategies differ significantly between training paradigms. Window-level within-channel normalization yields the best performance in supervised tasks, while minimal or cross-channel normalization at the window level is more effective for SSL. These results underscore the necessity of task-specific normalization choices and challenge the assumption that a universal normalization strategy can generalize across learning settings. Our findings provide practical insights for developing robust EEG deep learning pipelines as the field shifts toward large-scale, foundation model training.

Authors: Rahul Gulia, Amlan Ganguly, Andres Kwasinski, Michael E. Kuhl, Ehsan Rashedi, Clark Hochgraf
Abstract: The next decade will usher in a profound transformation of wireless communication, driven by the ever-increasing demand for data-intensive applications and the rapid adoption of emerging technologies. To fully unlock the potential of 5G and beyond, substantial advancements are required in signal processing techniques, innovative network architectures, and efficient spectrum utilization strategies. These advancements facilitate seamless integration of emerging technologies, driving industrial digital transformation and connectivity. This paper introduces a novel Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based framework, Wireless Infrastructure for Smart Warehouses using VAE (WISVA), designed for accurate indoor radio propagation modeling in automated Industry 4.0 environments such as warehouses and factory floors operating within 5G wireless bands. The research delves into the meticulous creation of training data tensors, capturing complex electromagnetic (EM) wave behaviors influenced by diverse obstacles, and outlines the architecture and training methodology of the proposed VAE model. The model's robustness and adaptability are showcased through its ability to predict signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) heatmaps across various scenarios, including denoising tasks, validation datasets, extrapolation to unseen configurations, and previously unencountered warehouse layouts. Compelling reconstruction error heatmaps are presented, highlighting the superior accuracy of WISVA compared to traditional autoencoder models. The paper also analyzes the model's performance in handling complex smart warehouse environments, demonstrating its potential as a key enabler for optimizing wireless infrastructure in Industry 4.0.

Title: A Complex UNet Approach for Non-Invasive Fetal ECG Extraction Using Single-Channel Dry Textile Electrodes
Authors: Iulia Orvas, Andrei Radu, Alessandra Galli, Ana Neacsu, Elisabetta Peri
Abstract: Continuous, non-invasive pregnancy monitoring is crucial for minimising potential complications. The fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) represents a promising tool for assessing fetal health beyond clinical environments. Home-based monitoring necessitates the use of a minimal number of comfortable and durable electrodes, such as dry textile electrodes. However, this setup presents many challenges, including increased noise and motion artefacts, which complicate the accurate extraction of fECG signals. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a pioneering method for extracting fECG from single-channel recordings obtained using dry textile electrodes using AI techniques. We created a new dataset by simulating abdominal recordings, including noise closely resembling real-world characteristics of in-vivo recordings through dry textile electrodes, alongside mECG and fECG. To ensure the reliability of the extracted fECG, we propose an innovative pipeline based on a complex-valued denoising network, Complex UNet. Unlike previous approaches that focused solely on signal magnitude, our method processes both real and imaginary components of the spectrogram, addressing phase information and preventing incongruous predictions. We evaluated our novel pipeline against traditional, well-established approaches, on both simulated and real data in terms of fECG extraction and R-peak detection. The results showcase that our suggested method achieves new state-of-the-art results, enabling an accurate extraction of fECG morphology across all evaluated settings. This method is the first to effectively extract fECG signals from single-channel recordings using dry textile electrodes, making a significant advancement towards a fully non-invasive and self-administered fECG extraction solution.

Title: A Portable and Cost-Effective System for Real-Time Air Quality Monitoring and Environmental Impact Assessment
Authors: S M Minhazur Rahman, Md. Amrin Ibna Hasnath, Rifatul Islam, Ahmed Faizul Haque Dhrubo, Mohammad Abdul Qayum
Abstract: Air pollution remains a major global issue that seriously impacts public health, environmental quality, and ultimately human health. To help monitor problem, we have created and constructed a low-cost, real-time, portable air quality monitoring system using cheap sensors. The system measures critical pollutants PM2.5, PM10, and carbon monoxide (CO), and environmental variables such as temperature and humidity. The system computes the Air Quality Index (AQI) and transmits the data via a Bluetooth connection. The data is relayed, in real time, to a mobile application. Because of its small size and low manufacturing cost the system readily lends itself to indoor and outdoor use and in urban and rural environments. In this paper we give an account of the system design, development, and validation, while demonstrating its accuracy and low-cost capabilities. We also consider its wider environmental, social, and regulatory implications with regards to; improving public awareness, being used for sustainability purposes and providing valuable information for informed decision making.

Title: Physics-Embedded Neural Networks for sEMG-based Continuous Motion Estimation
Authors: Wending Heng, Chaoyuan Liang, Yihui Zhao, Zhiqiang Zhang, Glen Cooper, Zhenhong Li
Abstract: Accurately decoding human motion intentions from surface electromyography (sEMG) is essential for myoelectric control and has wide applications in rehabilitation robotics and assistive technologies. However, existing sEMG-based motion estimation methods often rely on subject-specific musculoskeletal (MSK) models that are difficult to calibrate, or purely data-driven models that lack physiological consistency. This paper introduces a novel Physics-Embedded Neural Network (PENN) that combines interpretable MSK forward-dynamics with data-driven residual learning, thereby preserving physiological consistency while achieving accurate motion estimation. The PENN employs a recursive temporal structure to propagate historical estimates and a lightweight convolutional neural network for residual correction, leading to robust and temporally coherent estimations. A two-phase training strategy is designed for PENN. Experimental evaluations on six healthy subjects show that PENN outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in both root mean square error (RMSE) and $R^2$ metrics.

Title: Heart rate and respiratory rate prediction from noisy real-world smartphone based on Deep Learning methods
Authors: Ibne Farabi Shihab
Abstract: Using mobile phone video of the fingertip as a data source for estimating vital signs such as heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) during daily life has long been suggested. While existing literature indicates that these estimates are accurate to within several beats or breaths per minute, the data used to draw these conclusions are typically collected in laboratory environments under careful experimental control, and yet the results are assumed to generalize to daily life. In an effort to test it, a team of researchers collected a large dataset of mobile phone video recordings made during daily life and annotated with ground truth HR and RR labels from N=111 participants. They found that traditional algorithm performance on the fingerprint videos is worse than previously reported (7 times and 13 times worse for RR and HR, respectively). Fortunately, recent advancements in deep learning, especially in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), offer a promising solution to improve this performance. This study proposes a new method for estimating HR and RR using a novel 3D deep CNN, demonstrating a reduced error in estimated HR by 68% and RR by 75%. These promising results suggest that regressor-based deep learning approaches should be used in estimating HR and RR.

Title: Machine Learning for Proactive Groundwater Management: Early Warning and Resource Allocation
Authors: Chuan Li, Ruoxuan Yang
Abstract: Groundwater supports ecosystems, agriculture, and drinking water supplies worldwide, yet effective monitoring remains challenging due to sparse data, computational constraints, and delayed outputs from traditional approaches. We develop a machine learning pipeline that predicts groundwater level categories using climate data, hydro-meteorological records, and physiographic attributes processed through AutoGluon's automated ensemble framework. Our approach integrates geospatial preprocessing, domain-driven feature engineering, and automated model selection to overcome conventional monitoring limitations. Applied to a large-scale French dataset (n $>$ 3,440,000 observations from 1,500+ wells), the model achieves weighted F\_1 scores of 0.927 on validation data and 0.67 on temporally distinct test data. Scenario-based evaluations demonstrate practical utility for early warning systems and water allocation decisions under changing climate conditions. The open-source implementation provides a scalable framework for integrating machine learning into national groundwater monitoring networks, enabling more responsive and data-driven water management strategies.

Title: Privacy-aware IoT Fall Detection Services For Aging in Place
Authors: Abdallah Lakhdari, Jiajie Li, Amani Abusafia, Athman Bouguettaya
Abstract: Fall detection is critical to support the growing elderly population, projected to reach 2.1 billion by 2050. However, existing methods often face data scarcity challenges or compromise privacy. We propose a novel IoT-based Fall Detection as a Service (FDaaS) framework to assist the elderly in living independently and safely by accurately detecting falls. We design a service-oriented architecture that leverages Ultra-wideband (UWB) radar sensors as an IoT health-sensing service, ensuring privacy and minimal intrusion. We address the challenges of data scarcity by utilizing a Fall Detection Generative Pre-trained Transformer (FD-GPT) that uses augmentation techniques. We developed a protocol to collect a comprehensive dataset of the elderly daily activities and fall events. This resulted in a real dataset that carefully mimics the elderly's routine. We rigorously evaluate and compare various models using this dataset. Experimental results show our approach achieves 90.72% accuracy and 89.33% precision in distinguishing between fall events and regular activities of daily living.

Title: Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient for MIMO-AFDM System
Authors: Jun Zhu, Yin Xu, Dazhi He, Haoyang Li, Yunfeng Guan, Wenjun Zhang
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is a promising chirp-assisted multicarrier waveform for future high mobility communications. A significant challenge in MIMO-AFDM systems is the multi-user interference (MUI), which can be effectively addressed by employing precoding techniques. However, the complexity introduced by AFDM makes the precoding process computationally expensive and challenging. To overcome this issue, We combine AFDM channel sparse property and using Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) method to iteratively process the precoding, thereby reducing the complexity of the precoding design. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed sparsification approach, coupled with the PCG method, achieving quite precoding performance while significantly reducing computational complexity. This makes the application of AFDM more feasible and efficient for high-mobility communication scenarios, paving the way for its broader implementation in next-generation communication systems.

Title: SegmentAnyMuscle: A universal muscle segmentation model across different locations in MRI
Authors: Roy Colglazier, Jisoo Lee, Haoyu Dong, Hanxue Gu, Yaqian Chen, Joseph Cao, Zafer Yildiz, Zhonghao Liu, Nicholas Konz, Jichen Yang, Jikai Zhang, Yuwen Chen, Lin Li, Adrian Camarena, Maciej A. Mazurowski
Abstract: The quantity and quality of muscles are increasingly recognized as important predictors of health outcomes. While MRI offers a valuable modality for such assessments, obtaining precise quantitative measurements of musculature remains challenging. This study aimed to develop a publicly available model for muscle segmentation in MRIs and demonstrate its applicability across various anatomical locations and imaging sequences. A total of 362 MRIs from 160 patients at a single tertiary center (Duke University Health System, 2016-2020) were included, with 316 MRIs from 114 patients used for model development. The model was tested on two separate sets: one with 28 MRIs representing common sequence types, achieving an average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 88.45%, and another with 18 MRIs featuring less frequent sequences and abnormalities such as muscular atrophy, hardware, and significant noise, achieving 86.21% DSC. These results demonstrate the feasibility of a fully automated deep learning algorithm for segmenting muscles on MRI across diverse settings. The public release of this model enables consistent, reproducible research into the relationship between musculature and health.

Title: Dimensionality Reduction on IoT Monitoring Data of Smart Building for Energy Consumption Forecasting
Authors: Konstantinos Koutras, Agorakis Bompotas, Constantinos Halkiopoulos, Athanasios Kalogeras, Christos Alexakos
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a major role today in smart building infrastructures, from simple smart-home applications, to more sophisticated industrial type installations. The vast amounts of data generated from relevant systems can be processed in different ways revealing important information. This is especially true in the era of edge computing, when advanced data analysis and decision-making is gradually moving to the edge of the network where devices are generally characterised by low computing resources. In this context, one of the emerging main challenges is related to maintaining data analysis accuracy even with less data that can be efficiently handled by low resource devices. The present work focuses on correlation analysis of data retrieved from a pilot IoT network installation monitoring a small smart office by means of environmental and energy consumption sensors. The research motivation was to find statistical correlation between the monitoring variables that will allow the use of machine learning (ML) prediction algorithms for energy consumption reducing input parameters. For this to happen, a series of hypothesis tests for the correlation of three different environmental variables with the energy consumption were carried out. A total of ninety tests were performed, thirty for each pair of variables. In these tests, p-values showed the existence of strong or semi-strong correlation with two environmental variables, and of a weak correlation with a third one. Using the proposed methodology, we manage without examining the entire data set to exclude weak correlated variables while keeping the same score of accuracy.

Title: Multi-Modal Beamforming with Model Compression and Modality Generation for V2X Networks
Authors: Chen Shang, Dinh Thai Hoang, Jiadong Yu
Abstract: Integrating sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a cornerstone technology for predictive beamforming in 6G-enabled vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks. However, existing ISAC paradigms rely solely on radio frequency (RF) signal, limiting sensing resolution and robustness in V2X environments with high mobility and multipath interference. Fortunately, the widespread deployment of diverse non-RF sensors such as cameras and LiDAR, along with the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and communication systems, offers new opportunities to improve the synergy between sensing and communication. Motivated by this, this work develops a novel and robust communication framework that leverages multi-modal sensing data and advanced AI technologies to assist beamforming in dynamic and realistic vehicular scenarios. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal learning framework for predictive beamforming that integrates modality-specific branches and employs hierarchical Transformer to capture cross-modal features. By exploiting the intrinsic correlation between multi-modal sensing data and beamforming decisions, this design enhances the accuracy and robustness of beamforming in dynamic V2X scenarios. To enable practical deployment on resource-constrained edge device (i.e., the roadside unit), we then develop a module-aware compression strategy that significantly reduces inference latency while preserving model performance. Furthermore, to address potential modality missing in real-world scenarios, we introduce a generative model that is able to reconstruct missing inputs from available observations, allowing the framework to operate reliably even under incomplete sensing conditions. Extensive simulation results conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed scheme consistently outperforms existing baselines across various metrics.

Title: Continual Learning for Wireless Channel Prediction
Authors: Muhammad Ahmed Mohsin, Muhammad Umer, Ahsan Bilal, Muhammad Ali Jamshed, John M. Cioffi
Abstract: Modern 5G/6G deployments routinely face cross-configuration handovers--users traversing cells with different antenna layouts, carrier frequencies, and scattering statistics--which inflate channel-prediction NMSE by $37.5\%$ on average when models are naively fine-tuned. The proposed improvement frames this mismatch as a continual-learning problem and benchmarks three adaptation families: replay with loss-aware reservoirs, synaptic-importance regularization, and memory-free learning-without-forgetting. Across three representative 3GPP urban micro scenarios, the best replay and regularization schemes cut the high-SNR error floor by up to 2~dB ($\approx 35\%$), while even the lightweight distillation recovers up to $30\%$ improvement over baseline handover prediction schemes. These results show that targeted rehearsal and parameter anchoring are essential for handover-robust CSI prediction and suggest a clear migration path for embedding continual-learning hooks into current channel prediction efforts in 3GPP--NR and O-RAN.

Title: Optical Waveguide-based Spider Web Enables Resilient Impact Detection and Localization
Authors: Dylan Wilson, Marco Pontin, Peter Walters, Perla Maiolino
Abstract: Spiders use their webs as multifunctional tools that enable capturing and localizing prey and more general environmental sensing through vibrations. Inspired by their biological function, we present a spider web-inspired optical waveguide system for resilient impulse detection and localization. The structure consists of six clear thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) waveguides arranged radially and interconnected by a spiral TPU thread, mimicking orb spider webs. Light transmission losses, induced by vibrations, are measured via coupled LEDs and photo-diodes, allowing real-time detection. We systematically characterize individual waveguides, analyzing key parameters such as tension, impulse position, and break angle to optimize vibrational response. The complete system is validated through controlled experiments, revealing a 5 ms propagation delay in vibration transfer between adjacent radii, enhancing localization capabilities. We demonstrate a robust impulse detection and localization algorithm leveraging time delay analysis, achieving reliable event identification even in cases of sensor failure. This study highlights the potential of bioinspired optical waveguide structures for adaptive sensing, with applications in soft robotics, structural monitoring, and environmental sensing.

Title: An Interpretable Transformer-Based Foundation Model for Cross-Procedural Skill Assessment Using Raw fNIRS Signals
Authors: A. Subedi, S. De, L. Cavuoto, S. Schwaitzberg, M. Hackett, J. Norfleet
Abstract: Objective skill assessment in high-stakes procedural environments requires models that not only decode underlying cognitive and motor processes but also generalize across tasks, individuals, and experimental contexts. While prior work has demonstrated the potential of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) for evaluating cognitive-motor performance, existing approaches are often task-specific, rely on extensive preprocessing, and lack robustness to new procedures or conditions. Here, we introduce an interpretable transformer-based foundation model trained on minimally processed fNIRS signals for cross-procedural skill assessment. Pretrained using self-supervised learning on data from laparoscopic surgical tasks and endotracheal intubation (ETI), the model achieves greater than 88% classification accuracy on all tasks, with Matthews Correlation Coefficient exceeding 0.91 on ETI. It generalizes to a novel emergency airway procedure--cricothyrotomy--using fewer than 30 labeled samples and a lightweight (less than 2k parameter) adapter module, attaining an AUC greater than 87%. Interpretability is achieved via a novel channel attention mechanism--developed specifically for fNIRS--that identifies functionally coherent prefrontal sub-networks validated through ablation studies. Temporal attention patterns align with task-critical phases and capture stress-induced changes in neural variability, offering insight into dynamic cognitive states.

Title: Zero-Shot EEG-to-Gait Decoding via Phase-Aware Representation Learning
Authors: Xi Fu, Weibang Jiang, Rui Liu, Gernot R. Müller-Putz, Cuntai Guan
Abstract: Accurate decoding of lower-limb motion from EEG signals is essential for advancing brain-computer interface (BCI) applications in movement intent recognition and control. However, challenges persist in achieving causal, phase-consistent predictions and in modeling both inter- and intra-subject variability. To address these issues, we propose NeuroDyGait, a domain-generalizable EEG-to-motion decoding framework that leverages structured contrastive representation learning and relational domain modeling. The proposed method employs relative contrastive learning to achieve semantic alignment between EEG and motion embeddings. Furthermore, a multi-cycle gait reconstruction objective is introduced to enforce temporal coherence and maintain biomechanical consistency. To promote inter-session generalization, during fine-tuning, a domain dynamic decoding mechanism adaptively assigns session-specific prediction heads and learns to mix their outputs based on inter-session relationships. NeuroDyGait enables zero-shot motion prediction for unseen individuals without requiring adaptation and achieves superior performance in cross-subject gait decoding on benchmark datasets. Additionally, it demonstrates strong phase-detection capabilities even without explicit phase supervision during training. These findings highlight the potential of relational domain learning in enabling scalable, target-free deployment of BCIs.

Title: A Multi-Criteria Evaluation Framework for Siting Fusion Energy Facilities: Application and Evaluation of U.S. Coal Power Plants
Authors: Muhammad R. Abdussami, Kevin Daley, Gabrielle Hoelzle, Aditi Verma
Abstract: This paper proposes a comprehensive methodology for siting fusion energy facilities, integrating expert judgment, geospatial data, and multi-criteria decision making tools to evaluate site suitability systematically. As a case study, we apply this framework to all currently operational coal power plant sites in the United States to examine their potential for hosting future fusion facilities at a time when these coal plants are shut down on reaching their end of life - timelines which are expected to coincide with the potential deployment of fusion energy facilities. Drawing on 22 siting criteria - including state and federal policies, risk and hazard assessments, and spatial and infrastructural parameters - we implement two MultiCriteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods: the Fuzzy Full Consistency Method (F-FUCOM) to derive attribute weights and the Weighted Sum Method (WSM) to rank sites based on composite suitability scores. By focusing on fusion-specific siting needs and demonstrating the framework through a coal site application, this study contributes a scalable and transparent decision-support tool for identifying optimal fusion energy deployment locations.

Title: Masked Autoencoders that Feel the Heart: Unveiling Simplicity Bias for ECG Analyses
Authors: He-Yang Xu, Hongxiang Gao, Yuwen Li, Xiu-Shen Wei, Chengyu Liu
Abstract: The diagnostic value of electrocardiogram (ECG) lies in its dynamic characteristics, ranging from rhythm fluctuations to subtle waveform deformations that evolve across time and frequency domains. However, supervised ECG models tend to overfit dominant and repetitive patterns, overlooking fine-grained but clinically critical cues, a phenomenon known as Simplicity Bias (SB), where models favor easily learnable signals over subtle but informative ones. In this work, we first empirically demonstrate the presence of SB in ECG analyses and its negative impact on diagnostic performance, while simultaneously discovering that self-supervised learning (SSL) can alleviate it, providing a promising direction for tackling the bias. Following the SSL paradigm, we propose a novel method comprising two key components: 1) Temporal-Frequency aware Filters to capture temporal-frequency features reflecting the dynamic characteristics of ECG signals, and 2) building on this, Multi-Grained Prototype Reconstruction for coarse and fine representation learning across dual domains, further mitigating SB. To advance SSL in ECG analyses, we curate a large-scale multi-site ECG dataset with 1.53 million recordings from over 300 clinical centers. Experiments on three downstream tasks across six ECG datasets demonstrate that our method effectively reduces SB and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code and dataset will be released publicly.

Title: High Resolution Isotropic 3D Cine imaging with Automated Segmentation using Concatenated 2D Real-time Imaging and Deep Learning
Authors: Mark Wrobel (1), Michele Pascale (1), Tina Yao (1), Ruaraidh Campbell (1), Elena Milano (2), Michael Quail (1 and 2), Jennifer Steeden (1), Vivek Muthurangu (1) ((1) UCL Centre for Translational Cardiovascular Imaging, University College London, (2) Great Ormond Street Hospital)
Abstract: Background: Conventional cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in paediatric and congenital heart disease uses 2D, breath-hold, balanced steady state free precession (bSSFP) cine imaging for assessment of function and cardiac-gated, respiratory-navigated, static 3D bSSFP whole-heart imaging for anatomical assessment. Our aim is to concatenate a stack 2D free-breathing real-time cines and use Deep Learning (DL) to create an isotropic a fully segmented 3D cine dataset from these images. Methods: Four DL models were trained on open-source data that performed: a) Interslice contrast correction; b) Interslice respiratory motion correction; c) Super-resolution (slice direction); and d) Segmentation of right and left atria and ventricles (RA, LA, RV, and LV), thoracic aorta (Ao) and pulmonary arteries (PA). In 10 patients undergoing routine cardiovascular examination, our method was validated on prospectively acquired sagittal stacks of real-time cine images. Quantitative metrics (ventricular volumes and vessel diameters) and image quality of the 3D cines were compared to conventional breath hold cine and whole heart imaging. Results: All real-time data were successfully transformed into 3D cines with a total post-processing time of <1 min in all cases. There were no significant biases in any LV or RV metrics with reasonable limits of agreement and correlation. There is also reasonable agreement for all vessel diameters, although there was a small but significant overestimation of RPA diameter. Conclusion: We have demonstrated the potential of creating a 3D-cine data from concatenated 2D real-time cine images using a series of DL models. Our method has short acquisition and reconstruction times with fully segmented data being available within 2 minutes. The good agreement with conventional imaging suggests that our method could help to significantly speed up CMR in clinical practice.

Title: 50 GHz Piezoelectric Acoustic Filter
Authors: Omar Barrera, Jack Kramer, Lezli Matto, Vakhtang Chulukhadze, Sinwoo Cho, Michael Liao, Mark S. Goorsky, Ruochen Lu
Abstract: This paper presents significant frequency scaling of acoustic filter technology to 50 GHz. This achievement is enabled by the P3F LiNbO3 multilayer stack, in which piezoelectric thin-films of alternating orientations are transferred in sequence, thereby allowing efficient exploitation of high-order modes with high quality factor (Q) and coupling coefficient (k2) in a thicker piezoelectric stack. The demonstrated filter is comprised of twelfth-order symmetric (S12) mode lateral-field-excited bulk acoustic wave resonators (XBARs), built on a 4-layer periodically poled piezoelectric (P3F) 128 Y-cut lithium niobate (LiNbO3) stack. The filter exhibits 3.3 dB insertion loss (IL) and a fractional bandwidth (FBW) of 2.9%. The miniature design, with a footprint of 0.36 mm2, makes it promising for future wireless front-end applications. These results represent the highest frequency acoustic filters reported to date, setting a new benchmark in piezoelectric filter technology. Upon further development, the platform could enable filters further into the FR2 range, essential for next-generation communication systems.

Title: Data-Efficient Excavation Force Estimation for Wheel Loaders
Authors: Armin Abdolmohammadi, Navid Mojahed, Shima Nazari, Bahram Ravani
Abstract: Accurate excavation force prediction is essential for enabling autonomous operation and optimizing control strategies in earthmoving machinery. Conventional methods typically require extensive data collection or simulations across diverse soil types, limiting scalability and adaptability. This paper proposes a data-efficient framework that calibrates soil parameters using force data from the prior bucket-loading cycle. Leveraging an analytical soil-tool interaction model, the fundamental earthmoving equation (FEE), our approach uses a multi-stage optimization strategy, on soil parameters during the loading phase. These fitted parameters are then used to predict excavation forces in the upcoming digging cycle, allowing the system to adapt its control inputs without the need for extensive data collection or machine learning-based model training. The framework is validated in high-fidelity simulations using the Algoryx Dynamics engine, across multiple soil types and excavation trajectories, demonstrating accurate force predictions with root-mean-square errors of 10\% to 15\% in primary test cases. This cycle-to-cycle adaptation strategy showcases the potential for online and scalable efficient path planning for wheel loader operations.

Title: FedCLAM: Client Adaptive Momentum with Foreground Intensity Matching for Federated Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Vasilis Siomos, Jonathan Passerat-Palmbach, Giacomo Tarroni
Abstract: Federated learning is a decentralized training approach that keeps data under stakeholder control while achieving superior performance over isolated training. While inter-institutional feature discrepancies pose a challenge in all federated settings, medical imaging is particularly affected due to diverse imaging devices and population variances, which can diminish the global model's effectiveness. Existing aggregation methods generally fail to adapt across varied circumstances. To address this, we propose FedCLAM, which integrates \textit{client-adaptive momentum} terms derived from each client's loss reduction during local training, as well as a \textit{personalized dampening factor} to curb overfitting. We further introduce a novel \textit{intensity alignment} loss that matches predicted and ground-truth foreground distributions to handle heterogeneous image intensity profiles across institutions and devices. Extensive evaluations on two datasets show that FedCLAM surpasses eight cutting-edge methods in medical segmentation tasks, underscoring its efficacy. The code is available at this https URL.

Title: Multi-Domain FeFET-Based Pixel for In-Sensor Multiply-and-Accumulate Operations
Authors: Md Rahatul Islam Udoy, Wantong Li, Kai Ni, Ahmedullah Aziz
Abstract: This paper presents an FeFET-based active pixel sensor that performs in-sensor multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations by leveraging the multi-domain polarization states of ferroelectric layers. The proposed design integrates a programmable FeFET into a 3-transistor pixel circuit, where the FeFET's non-volatile conductance encodes the weight, and the photodiode voltage drop encodes the input. Their interaction generates an output current proportional to the product, enabling in-pixel analog multiplication. Accumulation is achieved by summing output currents along shared column lines, realizing full MAC functionality within the image sensor array. Extensive HSPICE simulations, using 45 nm CMOS models, validate the operation and confirm the scalability of the design. This compact and power-efficient architecture minimizes data movement, making it ideal for real-time edge computing, neuromorphic vision, and secure sensing applications.

Abstract: We propose a self-speaker adaptation method for streaming multi-talker automatic speech recognition (ASR) that eliminates the need for explicit speaker queries. Unlike conventional approaches requiring target speaker embeddings or enrollment audio, our technique dynamically adapts individual ASR instances through speaker-wise speech activity prediction. The key innovation involves injecting speaker-specific kernels generated via speaker supervision activations into selected ASR encoder layers. This enables instantaneous speaker adaptation to target speakers while handling fully overlapped speech even in a streaming scenario. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance in both offline and streaming scenarios, demonstrating that our self-adaptive method effectively addresses severe speech overlap through streamlined speaker-focused recognition. The results validate the proposed self-speaker adaptation approach as a robust solution for multi-talker ASR under severe overlapping speech conditions.

Title: QoS-aware State-Augmented Learnable Algorithm for Wireless Coexistence Parameter Management
Authors: Mohammad Reza Fasihi, Brian L. Mark
Abstract: Efficient and fair coexistence in unlicensed spectrum is essential to support heterogeneous networks such as 5G NR-U and Wi-Fi, which often contend for shared wireless resources. We introduce a general framework for wireless Coexistence Parameter Management (CPM) based on state-augmented constrained reinforcement learning. We propose a novel algorithm, QaSAL-CPM, which incorporates state-augmentation by embedding the dual variables in the constrained optimization formulation directly into the agent's observation space. This method enables the agent to respond to constraint violations in real time while continuing to optimize a primary performance objective. Through extensive simulations of 5G NR-U and Wi-Fi coexistence scenarios, we show that QaSAL-CPM achieves reliable QoS compliance and improved policy robustness across various transmitter densities compared to previous approaches. The proposed framework offers a scalable and adaptive solution for real-time coexistence optimization in next-generation wireless networks.

Title: A Correlation-Based Design of RIS for Reduced Power Consumption and Simplified Control Circuitry
Authors: Zina Mohamed, Ammar B. Kouki, Sonia Aïssa
Abstract: Aiming at simplifying the hardware structure and reducing the energy consumption in wireless communication via reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), this paper introduces a novel RIS design founded on the correlation between the phase shift values of the surface elements. First, a correlation analysis is conducted, considering the azimuth angle of a target device within a coverage region spanning from $-80^{\circ}$ to $80^{\circ}$. The correlation is demonstrated for different deployment cases, creating the basis for the new RIS structure, termed Connected-RIS, where correlated elements are designed to share the same control signal. The fundamental performance of the proposed design is then analyzed in terms of control signals, power consumption, and communication system performance, comparing it to two RIS structures with full control: one with the same size as the proposed design, and the other employing the minimum number of elements necessary to satisfy the fair coverage criterion. The correlation-based RIS design enables three-dimensional passive beamforming and significantly reduces the number of required load impedances and control signals, thereby lowering the hardware cost and simplifying the control circuitry. It also achieves substantial power savings as compared to the baseline schemes, while maintaining sufficient gain for a fair radio coverage. For instance, numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed design reduces the power consumption by almost 86-92\% and the control signals by 83-98\% compared to operation with fully controlled RIS.

Title: X-pSRAM: A Photonic SRAM with Embedded XOR Logic for Ultra-Fast In-Memory Computing
Authors: Md Abdullah-Al Kaiser, Sugeet Sunder, Ajey P. Jacob, Akhilesh R. Jaiswal
Abstract: Traditional von Neumann architectures suffer from fundamental bottlenecks due to continuous data movement between memory and processing units, a challenge that worsens with technology scaling as electrical interconnect delays become more significant. These limitations impede the performance and energy efficiency required for modern data-intensive applications. In contrast, photonic in-memory computing presents a promising alternative by harnessing the advantages of light, enabling ultra-fast data propagation without length-dependent impedance, thereby significantly reducing computational latency and energy consumption. This work proposes a novel differential photonic static random access memory (pSRAM) bitcell that facilitates electro-optic data storage while enabling ultra-fast in-memory Boolean XOR computation. By employing cross-coupled microring resonators and differential photodiodes, the XOR-augmented pSRAM (X-pSRAM) bitcell achieves at least 10 GHz read, write, and compute operations entirely in the optical domain. Additionally, wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) enables n-bit XOR computation in a single-shot operation, supporting massively parallel processing and enhanced computational efficiency. Validated on GlobalFoundries' 45SPCLO node, the X-pSRAM consumed 13.2 fJ energy per bit for XOR computation, representing a significant advancement toward next-generation optical computing with applications in cryptography, hyperdimensional computing, and neural networks.

Abstract: This paper reports IEEE International Conference on Multimedia \& Expo (ICME) 2025 Grand Challenge on Generalizable HDR and SDR Video Quality Measurement. With the rapid development of video technology, especially High Dynamic Range (HDR) and Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) contents, the need for robust and generalizable Video Quality Assessment (VQA) methods has become increasingly demanded. Existing VQA models often struggle to deliver consistent performance across varying dynamic ranges, distortion types, and diverse content. This challenge was established to benchmark and promote VQA approaches capable of jointly handling HDR and SDR content. In the final evaluation phase, five teams submitted seven models along with technical reports to the Full Reference (FR) and No Reference (NR) tracks. Among them, four methods outperformed VMAF baseline, while the top-performing model achieved state-of-the-art performance, setting a new benchmark for generalizable video quality assessment.

Title: Channel Knowledge Map-assisted Dual-domain Tracking and Predictive Beamforming for High-Mobility Wireless Networks
Authors: Ruolin Du, Zhiqiang Wei, Zai Yang, Lei Yang, Yong Zeng, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng, Jinhong Yuan
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel channel knowledge map (CKM)-assisted dual-domain tracking and predictive beamforming scheme for high-mobility wireless networks. The central premise is that the CKM integrates both the coordinate and beam domains, thereby enabling tracking in one domain via treating the other domain's input as priors or measurements. In the coordinate domain (C-Domain), an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is employed to predict and track the state (i.e., location and velocity) of a moving communication receiver across time slots under both line-of-sight (LoS)-present and LoS-absent conditions, where the CKM provides a prior mapping from multipath channel parameters to potential target locations. In the beam domain (B-Domain), the updated location of the receiver is fed back to CKM to offer a priori information of angle of arrival (AoA) variations, which are incorporated to establish beam transition models for effective beam tracking, depending on the angular variation situation of each path. Then, we analyze the Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB) for AoA estimation for each path in the considered system and propose a jointly predictive beamforming and power allocation design to minimize AoA estimation errors, directly enhancing multipath beam tracking accuracy and indirectly improving target tracking performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves significant improvements in both target and beam tracking performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in AoA tracking of non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths, highlighting the potential gain of CKM in facilitating both target and beam tracking in high-mobility communications.

Title: Online Coreset Selection for Learning Dynamic Systems
Authors: Jingyuan Li, Dawei Shi, Ling Shi
Abstract: With the increasing availability of streaming data in dynamic systems, a critical challenge in data-driven modeling for control is how to efficiently select informative data to characterize system dynamics. In this work, we design an online coreset selection method under the framework of set-membership identification for systems subject to process disturbances, with the objective of improving data efficiency while ensuring convergence guarantees. Specifically, we first propose a stacked polyhedral representation that over-approximates the feasible set of system parameters. Leveraging a generalized Grünbaum's inequality, we design a geometric selection criterion for constructing the coreset. To reduce computational complexity, an online double-description-based constraint reduction method is introduced to simplify the polyhedral representation. Finally, we analyze the convergence of the feasible set with respect to the coreset and derive upper bounds on the selection probability and the expected number of data in the coreset. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through comprehensive simulation studies.

Title: Sensing Security Oriented OFDM-ISAC Against Multi-Intercept Threats
Authors: Lingyun Xu, Bowen Wang, Huiyong Li, Ziyang Cheng
Abstract: In recent years, security has emerged as a critical aspect of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. While significant research has focused on secure communications, particularly in ensuring physical layer security, the issue of sensing security has received comparatively less attention. This paper addresses the sensing security problem in ISAC, particularly under the threat of multi-intercept adversaries. We consider a realistic scenario in which the sensing target is an advanced electronic reconnaissance aircraft capable of employing multiple signal interception techniques, such as power detection (PD) and cyclostationary analysis (CA). To evaluate sensing security under such sophisticated threats, we analyze two critical features of the transmitted signal: (i) power distribution and (ii) cyclic spectrum. Further, we introduce a novel ergodic cyclic spectrum metric which leverages the intrinsic mathematical structure of cyclostationary signals to more comprehensively characterize their behavior. Building on this analysis, we formulate a new ISAC design problem that explicitly considers sensing security, and we develop a low-complexity, efficient optimization approach to solve it. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed metric is both effective and insightful, and that our ISAC design significantly enhances sensing security performance in the presence of multi-intercept threats.

Title: Coexistence analysis of Wi-Fi 6E and 5G NR-U in the 6 GHz band
Authors: Navid Keshtiarast, Marina Petrova
Abstract: The ever-increasing demand for broadband and IoT wireless connectivity has recently urged the regulators around the world to start opening the 6 GHz spectrum for unlicensed use. These bands will, for example, permit the use of additional 1.2 GHz in the US and 500 MHz in Europe for unlicensed radio access technologies (RATs) such as Wi-Fi and 5G New Radio Unlicensed (5G NR-U). To support QoS-sensitive applications with both technologies, fair and efficient coexistence approaches between the two RATs, as well as with incumbents already operating in the 6 GHz band, are crucial. In this paper, we study through extensive simulations the achievable mean downlink throughput of both Wi-Fi 6E APs and 5G NR-U gNBs when they are co-deployed in a dense residential scenario under high-interference conditions. We also explore how different parameter settings e.g., MAC frame aggregation, energy detection threshold and maximum channel occupancy time (MCOT) affect the coexistence. Our findings give important insights into how to tune the key parameters to design fair coexistence policies.

Title: Momentum-based Accelerated Algorithm for Distributed Optimization under Sector-Bound Nonlinearity
Authors: Mohammadreza Doostmohammadian, Hamid R. Rabiee
Abstract: Distributed optimization advances centralized machine learning methods by enabling parallel and decentralized learning processes over a network of computing nodes. This work provides an accelerated consensus-based distributed algorithm for locally non-convex optimization using the gradient-tracking technique. The proposed algorithm (i) improves the convergence rate by adding momentum towards the optimal state using the heavy-ball method, while (ii) addressing general sector-bound nonlinearities over the information-sharing network. The link nonlinearity includes any sign-preserving odd sector-bound mapping, for example, log-scale data quantization or clipping in practical applications. For admissible momentum and gradient-tracking parameters, using perturbation theory and eigen-spectrum analysis, we prove convergence even in the presence of sector-bound nonlinearity and for locally non-convex cost functions. Further, in contrast to most existing weight-stochastic algorithms, we adopt weight-balanced (WB) network design. This WB design and perturbation-based analysis allow to handle dynamic directed network of agents to address possible time-varying setups due to link failures or packet drops.

Title: Identification of Cellular Automata on Spaces of Bernoulli Probability Measures
Authors: Faizal Hafiz, Amelia Kunze, Enrico Formenti, Davide La Torre
Abstract: Classical Cellular Automata (CCAs) are a powerful computational framework for modeling global spatio-temporal dynamics with local interactions. While CCAs have been applied across numerous scientific fields, identifying the local rule that governs observed dynamics remains a challenging task. Moreover, the underlying assumption of deterministic cell states often limits the applicability of CCAs to systems characterized by inherent uncertainty. This study, therefore, focuses on the identification of Cellular Automata on spaces of probability measures (CAMs), where cell states are represented by probability distributions. This framework enables the modeling of systems with probabilistic uncertainty and spatially varying dynamics. Moreover, we formulate the local rule identification problem as a parameter estimation problem and propose a meta-heuristic search based on Self-adaptive Differential Evolution (SaDE) to estimate local rule parameters accurately from the observed data. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through local rule identification in two-dimensional CAMs with varying neighborhood types and radii.

Title: CA-Diff: Collaborative Anatomy Diffusion for Brain Tissue Segmentation
Authors: Qilong Xing, Zikai Song, Yuteng Ye, Yuke Chen, Youjia Zhang, Na Feng, Junqing Yu, Wei Yang
Abstract: Segmentation of brain structures from MRI is crucial for evaluating brain morphology, yet existing CNN and transformer-based methods struggle to delineate complex structures accurately. While current diffusion models have shown promise in image segmentation, they are inadequate when applied directly to brain MRI due to neglecting anatomical information. To address this, we propose Collaborative Anatomy Diffusion (CA-Diff), a framework integrating spatial anatomical features to enhance segmentation accuracy of the diffusion model. Specifically, we introduce distance field as an auxiliary anatomical condition to provide global spatial context, alongside a collaborative diffusion process to model its joint distribution with anatomical structures, enabling effective utilization of anatomical features for segmentation. Furthermore, we introduce a consistency loss to refine relationships between the distance field and anatomical structures and design a time adapted channel attention module to enhance the U-Net feature fusion procedure. Extensive experiments show that CA-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Title: Limited Feedback in RIS-Assisted Wireless Communications: Use Cases, Challenges, and Future Directions
Authors: Weicong Chen, Jiajia Guo, Yiming Cui, Xiao Li, Shi Jin
Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) is essential to unlock the potential of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in wireless communication systems. Since massive RIS elements are typically implemented without baseband signal processing capabilities, limited CSI feedback is necessary when designing the reflection/refraction coefficients of the RIS. In this article, the unique RIS-assisted channel features, such as the RIS position-dependent channel fluctuation, the ultra-high dimensional sub-channel matrix, and the structured sparsity, are distilled from recent advances in limited feedback and used as guidelines for designing feedback schemes. We begin by illustrating the use cases and the corresponding challenges associated with RIS feedback. We then discuss how to leverage techniques such as channel customization, structured-sparsity, autoencoders, and others to reduce feedback overhead and complexity when devising feedback schemes. Finally, we identify potential research directions by considering the unresolved challenges, the new RIS architecture, and the integration with multi-modal information and artificial intelligence.

Title: Real-Time Energy Management Strategies for Community Microgrids
Authors: Moslem Uddin, Huadong Mo, Daoyi Dong
Abstract: This study presents a real-time energy management framework for hybrid community microgrids integrating photovoltaic, wind, battery energy storage systems, diesel generators, and grid interconnection. The proposed approach formulates the dispatch problem as a multi-objective optimization task that aims to minimize operational costs. Two control strategies are proposed and evaluated: a conventional rule-based control (RBC) method and an advanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach utilizing proximal policy optimization (PPO). A realistic case study based on Australian load and generation profiles is used to validate the framework. Simulation results demonstrate that DRL-PPO reduces operational costs by 18%, CO_2 emissions by 20%, and improves system reliability by 87.5% compared to RBC. Beside, DRL-PPO increases renewable energy utilization by 13%, effectively reducing dependence on diesel generation and grid imports. These findings demonstrate the potential of DRL-based approaches to enable cost-effective and resilient microgrid operations, particularly in regional and remote communities.

Title: Differentiable Radar Ambiguity Functions: Mathematical Formulation and Computational Implementation
Authors: Marc Bara Iniesta
Abstract: The ambiguity function is fundamental to radar waveform design, characterizing range and Doppler resolution capabilities. However, its traditional formulation involves non-differentiable operations, preventing integration with gradient-based optimization methods and modern machine learning frameworks. This paper presents the first complete mathematical framework and computational implementation for differentiable radar ambiguity functions. Our approach addresses the fundamental technical challenges that have prevented the radar community from leveraging automatic differentiation: proper handling of complex-valued gradients using Wirtinger calculus, efficient computation through parallelized FFT operations, numerical stability throughout cascaded operations, and composability with arbitrary differentiable operations. We term this approach GRAF (Gradient-based Radar Ambiguity Functions), which reformulates the ambiguity function computation to maintain mathematical equivalence while enabling gradient flow through the entire pipeline. The resulting implementation provides a general-purpose differentiable ambiguity function compatible with modern automatic differentiation frameworks, enabling new research directions including neural network-based waveform generation with ambiguity constraints, end-to-end optimization of radar systems, and integration of classical radar theory with modern deep learning. We provide complete implementation details and demonstrate computational efficiency suitable for practical applications. This work establishes the mathematical and computational foundation for applying modern machine learning techniques to radar waveform design, bridging classical radar signal processing with automatic differentiation frameworks.

Title: Rate Maximization for Fluid Antenna System Assisted Semantic Communication
Authors: Siyun Liang, Chen Zhu, Zhaohui Yang, Changsheng You, Dusit Niyato, Kai-Kit Wong, Zhaoyang Zhang
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of rate maximization in a fluid antenna system (FAS) assisted semantic communication system. In the considered model, a base station (BS) with multiple static antennas employs semantic extraction techniques to compress the data ready to be sent to a user. The user equipped with a fluid antenna is located in the near field coverage region of the BS. Our aim is to jointly optimize the transmit beamforming and the semantic compression rate at the BS, as well as the selection of activated ports in FAS, to maximize the equivalent transmission ratio under a specific power budget. We design an alternating algorithm to solve the problem, where we obtain the optimal semantic compression ratio is in closed form at each step. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Title: Hierarchical Characterization of Brain Dynamics via State Space-based Vector Quantization
Authors: Yanwu Yang, Thomas Wolfers
Abstract: Understanding brain dynamics through functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) remains a fundamental challenge in neuroscience, particularly in capturing how the brain transitions between various functional states. Recently, metastability, which refers to temporarily stable brain states, has offered a promising paradigm to quantify complex brain signals into interpretable, discretized representations. In particular, compared to cluster-based machine learning approaches, tokenization approaches leveraging vector quantization have shown promise in representation learning with powerful reconstruction and predictive capabilities. However, most existing methods ignore brain transition dependencies and lack a quantification of brain dynamics into representative and stable embeddings. In this study, we propose a Hierarchical State space-based Tokenization network, termed HST, which quantizes brain states and transitions in a hierarchical structure based on a state space-based model. We introduce a refined clustered Vector-Quantization Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) that incorporates quantization error feedback and clustering to improve quantization performance while facilitating metastability with representative and stable token representations. We validate our HST on two public fMRI datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in quantifying the hierarchical dynamics of the brain and its potential in disease diagnosis and reconstruction performance. Our method offers a promising framework for the characterization of brain dynamics, facilitating the analysis of metastability.

Title: Hierarchical Decentralized Stochastic Control for Cyber-Physical Systems
Authors: Kesav Kazam Ramachandran Anantharaman, Rahul Meshram
Abstract: This paper presents a two-timescale hierarchical decentralized architecture for control of Cyber-Physical Systems. The architecture consists of $N$ independent sub-processes, a global controller, and $N$ local controllers, each formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The global controller, operating at a slower timescale optimizes the infinite-horizon discounted cumulative reward under budget constraints. For the local controllers, operating at a faster timescale, we propose two different optimization frameworks, namely the COpt and FOpt. In the COpt framework, the local controller also optimizes an infinite-horizon MDP, while in the FOpt framework, the local controller optimizes a finite-horizon MDP. The FOpt framework mimics a federal structure, where the local controllers have more autonomy in their decision making. First, the existence of stationary deterministic optimal policies for both these frameworks is established. Then, various relationships between the two frameworks are studied, including a bound on the difference between the two optimal value functions. Additionally, sufficiency conditions are provided such that the two frameworks lead to the same optimal values.

Title: Adaptable Non-parametric Approach for Speech-based Symptom Assessment: Isolating Private Medical Data in a Retrieval Datastore
Authors: Yu-Wen Chen, Julia Hirschberg
Abstract: The automatic assessment of health-related acoustic cues has the potential to improve healthcare accessibility and affordability. Although parametric models are promising, they face challenges in privacy and adaptability. To address these, we propose a NoN-Parametric framework for Speech-based symptom Assessment (NoNPSA). By isolating medical data in a retrieval datastore, NoNPSA avoids encoding private information in model parameters and enables efficient data updates. A self-supervised learning (SSL) model pre-trained on general-purpose datasets extracts features, which are used for similarity-based retrieval. Metadata-aware refinement filters the retrieved data, and associated labels are used to compute an assessment score. Experimental results show that NoNPSA achieves competitive performance compared to fine-tuning SSL-based methods, while enabling greater privacy, update efficiency, and adaptability--showcasing the potential of non-parametric approaches in healthcare.

Authors: Vaigai Nayaki Yokar, Hoa Le-Minh, Zabih Ghassemlooy, Wai Lok Woo
Abstract: In this paper, we present a blur reduction technique for smartphone-to-smartphone visible light communications (S2SVLC). The key technique it to avoid the repeated scanning of the transmitted data and to lower the amount of data discarded at the receiver end of the S2SVLC system. This image processing method will improve the system recognition efficiency and data rate. The proposed method includes converting the red-green-blue (RGB) image into grayscale, applying contrast enhancement, scaling and binarizing the image to reduce the blur levels in the image. The experiment includes practical data acquisition and further processing and estimation in MATLAB. The experiment is carried out in different conditions like distance, rotation, and tilt also considering different surrounding illuminations like ambient light and no light conditions to estimate the blur levels in S2SVLC. In this experimental investigation two types of coding, American Standard code for information interchange (ASCII), and quick response (QR) code are used for data transmission in S2SVLC. The obtained results indicate that, the proposed technique is proven to improve the recovery efficiency to 96% in the receiver end at different conditions.

We analyze the Lambertian order of the smartphone screen and carry out a channel characterization of a screen to camera link-based VLC system under specific test conditions.

Title: Zak-OFDM: Low Complexity Joint Equalization of OFDM Carriers in Doubly-Spread Channels
Authors: Saif Khan Mohammed, Sandesh Rao Mattu, Nishant Mehrotra, Venkatesh Khammammetti, Robert Calderbank
Abstract: We communicate over wireless channels by first estimating and then equalizing the effective channel. In Zak-OTFS (orthogonal time frequency space) modulation the carrier waveform is a pulse in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, formally a quasi-periodic localized function with specific periods along delay and Doppler. When the channel delay spread is less than the delay period, and the channel Doppler spread is less than the Doppler period, the response to a single Zak-OTFS carrier provides an image of the scattering environment and can be used to predict the effective channel at all other carriers. This makes channel estimation straightforward, and there is no loss in spectral efficiency since it is possible to design data and pilot signals that are mutually unbiased. However, the naive approach to equalization has complexity ${\mathcal O}(M^3N^3)$ where $M$ and $N$ are respectively the number of delay and Doppler bins in an OTFS frame. We simplify equalization by transforming Zak-OTFS information symbols to CP-OFDM (cyclic prefix orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) modulation. Why not simply communicate with CP-OFDM? Inter-carrier interference (ICI) in CP-OFDM makes it is very challenging to acquire the complete frequency domain (FD) channel response between subcarriers in the presence of mobility and delay spread. We avoid this difficulty by estimating the effective channel in the DD domain from which we are able to reconstruct the complete FD channel response. We take advantage of CP-OFDM to design an ${\mathcal O}(M^2N^2)$ low-complexity method of jointly equalizing all subcarriers, where $MN$ is the number of subcarriers. Our approach removes the need for traditional pilots in CP-OFDM and reduces the need to vary carrier spacing with mobility.

Title: MedRegion-CT: Region-Focused Multimodal LLM for Comprehensive 3D CT Report Generation
Authors: Sunggu Kyung, Jinyoung Seo, Hyunseok Lim, Dongyeong Kim, Hyungbin Park, Jimin Sung, Jihyun Kim, Wooyoung Jo, Yoojin Nam, Namkug Kim
Abstract: The recent release of RadGenome-Chest CT has significantly advanced CT-based report generation. However, existing methods primarily focus on global features, making it challenging to capture region-specific details, which may cause certain abnormalities to go unnoticed. To address this, we propose MedRegion-CT, a region-focused Multi-Modal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework, featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce Region Representative ($R^2$) Token Pooling, which utilizes a 2D-wise pretrained vision model to efficiently extract 3D CT features. This approach generates global tokens representing overall slice features and region tokens highlighting target areas, enabling the MLLM to process comprehensive information effectively. Second, a universal segmentation model generates pseudo-masks, which are then processed by a mask encoder to extract region-centric features. This allows the MLLM to focus on clinically relevant regions, using six predefined region masks. Third, we leverage segmentation results to extract patient-specific attributions, including organ size, diameter, and locations. These are converted into text prompts, enriching the MLLM's understanding of patient-specific contexts. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we conducted benchmark experiments on report generation using the RadGenome-Chest CT. MedRegion-CT achieved state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in natural language generation quality and clinical relevance while maintaining interpretability. The code for our framework is publicly available.

Title: Belief Propagation-based Target Handover in Distributed Integrated Sensing and Communication
Authors: Liping Bai, Yu Ge, Henk Wymeersch
Abstract: Distributed integrated sensing and communication (DISAC) systems are key enablers for 6G networks, offering the capability to jointly track multiple targets using spatially distributed base stations (BSs). A fundamental challenge in DISAC is the seamless and efficient handover of target tracks between BSs with partially overlapping fields of view, especially in dense and dynamic environments. In this paper, we propose a novel target handover framework based on belief propagation (BP) for multi-target tracking in DISAC systems. By representing the probabilistic data association and tracking problem through a factor graph, the proposed method enables efficient marginal inference with reduced computational complexity. Our framework introduces a principled handover criterion and message-passing strategy that minimizes inter-BS communication while maintaining tracking continuity and accuracy. We demonstrate that the proposed handover procedure achieves performance comparable to centralized processing, yet significantly reduces data exchange and processing overhead. Extensive simulations validate the robustness of the approach in urban tracking scenarios with closely spaced targets.

Title: CRISP-SAM2: SAM2 with Cross-Modal Interaction and Semantic Prompting for Multi-Organ Segmentation
Authors: Xinlei Yu, Chanmiao Wang, Hui Jin, Ahmed Elazab, Gangyong Jia, Xiang Wan, Changqing Zou, Ruiquan Ge
Abstract: Multi-organ medical segmentation is a crucial component of medical image processing, essential for doctors to make accurate diagnoses and develop effective treatment plans. Despite significant progress in this field, current multi-organ segmentation models often suffer from inaccurate details, dependence on geometric prompts and loss of spatial information. Addressing these challenges, we introduce a novel model named CRISP-SAM2 with CRoss-modal Interaction and Semantic Prompting based on SAM2. This model represents a promising approach to multi-organ medical segmentation guided by textual descriptions of organs. Our method begins by converting visual and textual inputs into cross-modal contextualized semantics using a progressive cross-attention interaction mechanism. These semantics are then injected into the image encoder to enhance the detailed understanding of visual information. To eliminate reliance on geometric prompts, we use a semantic prompting strategy, replacing the original prompt encoder to sharpen the perception of challenging targets. In addition, a similarity-sorting self-updating strategy for memory and a mask-refining process is applied to further adapt to medical imaging and enhance localized details. Comparative experiments conducted on seven public datasets indicate that CRISP-SAM2 outperforms existing models. Extensive analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, thereby confirming its superior performance, especially in addressing the limitations mentioned earlier.

Title: Extreme Scenario Characterization for High Renewable Energy Penetrated Power Systems over Long Time Scales
Authors: Kai Kang, Feng Liu, Yifan Su, Zhaojian Wang
Abstract: Power systems with high renewable energy penetration are highly influenced by weather conditions, often facing significant challenges such as persistent power shortages and severe power fluctuations over long time scales. This paper addresses the critical need for effective characterization of extreme scenarios under these situations. First, novel risk indices are proposed to quantify the severity of continuous power shortages and substantial power fluctuations over long-term operations. These indices are independent of specific scheduling strategies and incorporate the system's resource regulation capabilities. By employing a filtering-based approach, the proposed indices focus on retaining key characteristics of continuous power shortages and fluctuation events, enabling the identification of extreme scenarios on long time scales. Secondly, an extreme scenario generation method is developed using Gaussian mixture models and sequential Monte Carlo simulation. Especially, this method periodically evaluates the severity of generated scenarios based on the defined risk indices, retaining extreme scenarios while discarding less critical ones. Finally, case studies based on real-world data demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. The results confirm that integrating the identified extreme scenarios significantly enhances the system's ability to ensure long-term security and reliability under high renewable energy penetration.

Title: Score-based Diffusion Model for Unpaired Virtual Histology Staining
Authors: Anran Liu, Xiaofei Wang, Jing Cai, Chao Li
Abstract: Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining visualizes histology but lacks specificity for diagnostic markers. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining provides protein-targeted staining but is restricted by tissue availability and antibody specificity. Virtual staining, i.e., computationally translating the H&E image to its IHC counterpart while preserving the tissue structure, is promising for efficient IHC generation. Existing virtual staining methods still face key challenges: 1) effective decomposition of staining style and tissue structure, 2) controllable staining process adaptable to diverse tissue and proteins, and 3) rigorous structural consistency modelling to handle the non-pixel-aligned nature of paired H&E and IHC images. This study proposes a mutual-information (MI)-guided score-based diffusion model for unpaired virtual staining. Specifically, we design 1) a global MI-guided energy function that disentangles the tissue structure and staining characteristics across modalities, 2) a novel timestep-customized reverse diffusion process for precise control of the staining intensity and structural reconstruction, and 3) a local MI-driven contrastive learning strategy to ensure the cellular level structural consistency between H&E-IHC images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the our superiority over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting its biomedical potential. Codes will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

Title: Multi-Branch DNN and CRLB-Ratio-Weight Fusion for Enhanced DOA Sensing via a Massive H$^2$AD MIMO Receiver
Authors: Feng Shu, Jiatong Bai, Di Wu, Wei Zhu, Bin Deng, Fuhui Zhou, Jiangzhou Wang
Abstract: As a green MIMO structure, massive H$^2$AD is viewed as a potential technology for the future 6G wireless network. For such a structure, it is a challenging task to design a low-complexity and high-performance fusion of target direction values sensed by different sub-array groups with fewer use of prior knowledge. To address this issue, a lightweight Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB)-ratio-weight fusion (WF) method is proposed, which approximates inverse CRLB of each subarray using antenna number reciprocals to eliminate real-time CRLB computation. This reduces complexity and prior knowledge dependence while preserving fusion performance. Moreover, a multi-branch deep neural network (MBDNN) is constructed to further enhance direction-of-arrival (DOA) sensing by leveraging candidate angles from multiple subarrays. The subarray-specific branch networks are integrated with a shared regression module to effectively eliminate pseudo-solutions and fuse true angles. Simulation results show that the proposed CRLB-ratio-WF method achieves DOA sensing performance comparable to CRLB-based methods, while significantly reducing the reliance on prior knowledge. More notably, the proposed MBDNN has superior performance in low-SNR ranges. At SNR $= -15$ dB, it achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in estimation accuracy compared to CRLB-ratio-WF method.

Title: Data-driven Implementations of Various Generalizations of Balanced Truncation
Authors: Umair Zulfiqar
Abstract: There exist two main frameworks for non-intrusive implementations of approximate balanced truncation: the quadrature-based framework and the ADI-based framework. Both approaches rely solely on samples of the transfer function to construct truncated balanced models, eliminating the need for access to the original model's state-space realization. Recently, the quadrature-based framework has been extended to various generalizations of balanced truncation, including positive-real balanced truncation, bounded-real balanced truncation, and balanced stochastic truncation. While this extension is theoretically nonintrusive-meaning it does not require the original state-space realization-it depends on samples of spectral factorizations of the transfer function. Since practical methods for obtaining such samples are currently unavailable, this extension remains largely a theoretical contribution. In this work, we present a non-intrusive ADI-type framework for these generalized balanced truncation methods that requires only samples of the original transfer function for implementation.

Title: Multi-Source COVID-19 Detection via Variance Risk Extrapolation
Authors: Runtian Yuan, Qingqiu Li, Junlin Hou, Jilan Xu, Yuejie Zhang, Rui Feng, Hao Chen
Abstract: We present our solution for the Multi-Source COVID-19 Detection Challenge, which aims to classify chest CT scans into COVID and Non-COVID categories across data collected from four distinct hospitals and medical centers. A major challenge in this task lies in the domain shift caused by variations in imaging protocols, scanners, and patient populations across institutions. To enhance the cross-domain generalization of our model, we incorporate Variance Risk Extrapolation (VREx) into the training process. VREx encourages the model to maintain consistent performance across multiple source domains by explicitly minimizing the variance of empirical risks across environments. This regularization strategy reduces overfitting to center-specific features and promotes learning of domain-invariant representations. We further apply Mixup data augmentation to improve generalization and robustness. Mixup interpolates both the inputs and labels of randomly selected pairs of training samples, encouraging the model to behave linearly between examples and enhancing its resilience to noise and limited data. Our method achieves an average macro F1 score of 0.96 across the four sources on the validation set, demonstrating strong generalization.

Title: Revisiting Z Transform Laplace Inversion: To Correct flaws in Signal and System Theory
Authors: Yuxin Yang, Hang Zhou, Chaojie Li, Xin Li, Yingyi Yan, Mingyang Zheng
Abstract: This paper revisits the classical formulation of the Z-transform and its relationship to the inverse Laplace transform (L-1), originally developed by Ragazzini in sampled-data theory. It identifies a longstanding mathematical oversight in standard derivations, which typically neglect the contribution from the infinite arc in the complex plane during inverse Laplace evaluation. This omission leads to inconsistencies, especially at discontinuities such as t = 0. By incorporating the full Bromwich contour, including all boundary contributions, we restore internal consistency between L-1 and the Z-transform, aligning the corrected L-1 with results from Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) aliasing theory. Consequently, this necessitates a structural revision of the Z-transform, inverse Laplace transform, and the behavior of the Heaviside step function at discontinuities, providing a more accurate foundation for modeling and analysis of sampled-data systems.

Title: Joint Trajectory and Resource Optimization for HAPs-SAR Systems with Energy-Aware Constraints
Authors: Bang Huang, Kihong Park, Xiaowei Pang, Mohamed-Slim Alouini
Abstract: This paper investigates the joint optimization of trajectory planning and resource allocation for a high-altitude platform stations synthetic aperture radar (HAPs-SAR) system. To support real-time sensing and conserve the limited energy budget of the HAPs, the proposed framework assumes that the acquired radar data are transmitted in real time to a ground base station for SAR image reconstruction. A dynamic trajectory model is developed, and the power consumption associated with radar sensing, data transmission, and circular flight is comprehensively analyzed. In addition, solar energy harvesting is considered to enhance system sustainability. An energy-aware mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem is formulated to maximize radar beam coverage while satisfying operational constraints. To solve this challenging problem, a sub-optimal successive convex approximation (SCA)-based framework is proposed, incorporating iterative optimization and finite search. Simulation results validate the convergence of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness in balancing SAR performance, communication reliability, and energy efficiency. A final SAR imaging simulation on a 9-target lattice scenario further confirms the practical feasibility of the proposed solution.

Title: Improving Myocardial Infarction Detection via Synthetic ECG Pretraining
Authors: Lachin Naghashyar
Abstract: Myocardial infarction is a major cause of death globally, and accurate early diagnosis from electrocardiograms (ECGs) remains a clinical priority. Deep learning models have shown promise for automated ECG interpretation, but require large amounts of labeled data, which are often scarce in practice. We propose a physiology-aware pipeline that (i) synthesizes 12-lead ECGs with tunable MI morphology and realistic noise, and (ii) pre-trains recurrent and transformer classifiers with self-supervised masked-autoencoding plus a joint reconstruction-classification objective. We validate the realism of synthetic ECGs via statistical and visual analysis, confirming that key morphological features are preserved. Pretraining on synthetic data consistently improved classification performance, particularly in low-data settings, with AUC gains of up to 4 percentage points. These results show that controlled synthetic ECGs can help improve MI detection when real clinical data is limited.

Title: Exposing and Mitigating Calibration Biases and Demographic Unfairness in MLLM Few-Shot In-Context Learning for Medical Image Classification
Authors: Xing Shen, Justin Szeto, Mingyang Li, Hengguan Huang, Tal Arbel
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enormous potential to perform few-shot in-context learning in the context of medical image analysis. However, safe deployment of these models into real-world clinical practice requires an in-depth analysis of the accuracies of their predictions, and their associated calibration errors, particularly across different demographic subgroups. In this work, we present the first investigation into the calibration biases and demographic unfairness of MLLMs' predictions and confidence scores in few-shot in-context learning for medical image classification. We introduce CALIN, an inference-time calibration method designed to mitigate the associated biases. Specifically, CALIN estimates the amount of calibration needed, represented by calibration matrices, using a bi-level procedure: progressing from the population level to the subgroup level prior to inference. It then applies this estimation to calibrate the predicted confidence scores during inference. Experimental results on three medical imaging datasets: PAPILA for fundus image classification, HAM10000 for skin cancer classification, and MIMIC-CXR for chest X-ray classification demonstrate CALIN's effectiveness at ensuring fair confidence calibration in its prediction, while improving its overall prediction accuracies and exhibiting minimum fairness-utility trade-off.

Title: Load Limiting Control for Component Life Extension
Authors: Chams Eddine Mballo, Robert Walters, Jonnalagadda V.R. Prasad
Abstract: This paper presents the development of a novel life-extending control scheme for critical helicopter components subjected to significant fatigue loading. The primary objective is to synthesize a more efficient and less conservative life-extending control scheme than those currently available in the literature. The proposed Load Limiting Control (LLC) scheme is a viable solution that addresses several issues that current life-extending control schemes suffer from, such as the neglect of fatigue damage induced by the harmonic component of loads and the inability to distinguish between aggressive and non-aggressive maneuvers. The proposed LLC scheme treats desired harmonic load limits as limit boundaries and recasts the problem of load limiting as a vehicle limit by computing a Control Margin (CM) using a limit detection and avoidance module. The computed CM is used as a cue to the pilot. The limit detection and avoidance module comprises an optimization algorithm, a model predictive controller, and a computationally simple on-board dynamical model. Simulations were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the LLC scheme in limiting harmonic pitch link loads during flight. One significant outcome is that, with sufficient training, the pilot can skillfully track the cue within 0.5 seconds of initiating the tracking task.

Title: ANN-Based Grid Impedance Estimation for Adaptive Gain Scheduling in VSG Under Dynamic Grid Conditions
Authors: Quang-Manh Hoang, Van Nam Nguyen, Taehyung Kim, Guilherme Vieira Hollweg, Wencong Su, Van-Hai Bui
Abstract: In contrast to grid-following inverters, Virtual Synchronous Generators (VSGs) perform well under weak grid conditions but may become unstable when the grid is strong. Grid strength depends on grid impedance, which unfortunately varies over time. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive gain-scheduling control scheme for VSGs. First, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) estimates the fundamental-frequency grid impedance; then these estimates are fed into an adaptive gain-scheduling function to recalculate controller parameters under varying grid conditions. The proposed method is validated in Simulink and compared with a conventional VSG employing fixed controller gains. The results demonstrate that settling times and overshoot percentages remain consistent across different grid conditions. Additionally, previously unseen grid impedance values are estimated with high accuracy and minimal time delay, making the approach well suited for real-time gain-scheduling control.

Title: BPD-Neo: An MRI Dataset for Lung-Trachea Segmentation with Clinical Data for Neonatal Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia
Authors: Rachit Saluja, Arzu Kovanlikaya, Candace Chien, Lauren Kathryn Blatt, Jeffrey M. Perlman, Stefan Worgall, Mert R. Sabuncu, Jonathan P. Dyke
Abstract: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common complication among preterm neonates, with portable X-ray imaging serving as the standard diagnostic modality in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). However, lung magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers a non-invasive alternative that avoids sedation and radiation while providing detailed insights into the underlying mechanisms of BPD. Leveraging high-resolution 3D MRI data, advanced image processing and semantic segmentation algorithms can be developed to assist clinicians in identifying the etiology of BPD. In this dataset, we present MRI scans paired with corresponding semantic segmentations of the lungs and trachea for 40 neonates, the majority of whom are diagnosed with BPD. The imaging data consist of free-breathing 3D stack-of-stars radial gradient echo acquisitions, known as the StarVIBE series. Additionally, we provide comprehensive clinical data and baseline segmentation models, validated against clinical assessments, to support further research and development in neonatal lung imaging.

Title: SurgTPGS: Semantic 3D Surgical Scene Understanding with Text Promptable Gaussian Splatting
Authors: Yiming Huang, Long Bai, Beilei Cui, Kun Yuan, Guankun Wang, Mobarakol Islam, Nicolas Padoy, Nassir Navab, Hongliang Ren
Abstract: In contemporary surgical research and practice, accurately comprehending 3D surgical scenes with text-promptable capabilities is particularly crucial for surgical planning and real-time intra-operative guidance, where precisely identifying and interacting with surgical tools and anatomical structures is paramount. However, existing works focus on surgical vision-language model (VLM), 3D reconstruction, and segmentation separately, lacking support for real-time text-promptable 3D queries. In this paper, we present SurgTPGS, a novel text-promptable Gaussian Splatting method to fill this gap. We introduce a 3D semantics feature learning strategy incorporating the Segment Anything model and state-of-the-art vision-language models. We extract the segmented language features for 3D surgical scene reconstruction, enabling a more in-depth understanding of the complex surgical environment. We also propose semantic-aware deformation tracking to capture the seamless deformation of semantic features, providing a more precise reconstruction for both texture and semantic features. Furthermore, we present semantic region-aware optimization, which utilizes regional-based semantic information to supervise the training, particularly promoting the reconstruction quality and semantic smoothness. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two real-world surgical datasets to demonstrate the superiority of SurgTPGS over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its potential to revolutionize surgical practices. SurgTPGS paves the way for developing next-generation intelligent surgical systems by enhancing surgical precision and safety. Our code is available at: this https URL.

Title: Physics informed guided diffusion for accelerated multi-parametric MRI reconstruction
Authors: Perla Mayo, Carolin M. Pirkl, Alin Achim, Bjoern Menze, Mohammad Golbabaee
Abstract: We introduce MRF-DiPh, a novel physics informed denoising diffusion approach for multiparametric tissue mapping from highly accelerated, transient-state quantitative MRI acquisitions like Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF). Our method is derived from a proximal splitting formulation, incorporating a pretrained denoising diffusion model as an effective image prior to regularize the MRF inverse problem. Further, during reconstruction it simultaneously enforces two key physical constraints: (1) k-space measurement consistency and (2) adherence to the Bloch response model. Numerical experiments on in-vivo brain scans data show that MRF-DiPh outperforms deep learning and compressed sensing MRF baselines, providing more accurate parameter maps while better preserving measurement fidelity and physical model consistency-critical for solving reliably inverse problems in medical imaging.

Title: Federated Breast Cancer Detection Enhanced by Synthetic Ultrasound Image Augmentation
Authors: Hongyi Pan, Ziliang Hong, Gorkem Durak, Ziyue Xu, Ulas Bagci
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaboratively training deep learning models across institutions without exchanging sensitive medical data. However, its effectiveness is often hindered by limited data availability and non-independent, identically distributed data across participating clients, which can degrade model performance and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a generative AI based data augmentation framework that integrates synthetic image sharing into the federated training process for breast cancer diagnosis via ultrasound images. Specifically, we train two simple class-specific Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks: one for benign and one for malignant lesions. We then simulate a realistic FL setting using three publicly available breast ultrasound image datasets: BUSI, BUS-BRA, and UDIAT. FedAvg and FedProx are adopted as baseline FL algorithms. Experimental results show that incorporating a suitable number of synthetic images improved the average AUC from 0.9206 to 0.9237 for FedAvg and from 0.9429 to 0.9538 for FedProx. We also note that excessive use of synthetic data reduced performance, underscoring the importance of maintaining a balanced ratio of real and synthetic samples. Our findings highlight the potential of generative AI based data augmentation to enhance FL results in the breast ultrasound image classification task.

Abstract: As the US rapidly moves towards cleaner energy sources, solar energy is fast becoming the pillar of its renewable energy mix. Even while solar energy is increasingly being used, its variability is a key hindrance to grid stability, storage efficiency, and system stability overall. Solar energy has emerged as one of the fastest-growing renewable energy sources in the United States, adding noticeably to the country's energy mix. Retrospectively, the necessity of inserting the sun's energy into the grid without disrupting reliability and cost efficiencies highlights the necessity of good forecasting software and smart control systems. The dataset utilized for this research project comprised both hourly and daily solar energy production records collected from multiple utility-scale solar farms across diverse U.S. regions, including California, Texas, and Arizona. Training and evaluation of all models were performed with a time-based cross-validation scheme, namely, sliding window validation. Both the Random Forest and the XG-Boost models demonstrated noticeably greater and the same performance across each of the measures considered, with relatively high accuracy. The almost perfect and equal performance by the Random Forest and XG-Boost models also shows both models to have learned the patterns in the data very comprehensively, with high reliability in their predictions. By incorporating AI-powered time-series models like XG-Boost in grid management software, utility companies can dynamically modify storage cycles in real-time as well as dispatch and peak load planning, based on their predictions. AI-powered solar forecasting also has profound implications for renewable energy policy and planning, particularly as U.S. federal and state governments accelerate toward ambitious decarbonization goals.

Title: Investigating an Overfitting and Degeneration Phenomenon in Self-Supervised Multi-Pitch Estimation
Authors: Frank Cwitkowitz, Zhiyao Duan
Abstract: Multi-Pitch Estimation (MPE) continues to be a sought after capability of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) systems, and is critical for many applications and downstream tasks involving pitch, including music transcription. However, existing methods are largely based on supervised learning, and there are significant challenges in collecting annotated data for the task. Recently, self-supervised techniques exploiting intrinsic properties of pitch and harmonic signals have shown promise for both monophonic and polyphonic pitch estimation, but these still remain inferior to supervised methods. In this work, we extend the classic supervised MPE paradigm by incorporating several self-supervised objectives based on pitch-invariant and pitch-equivariant properties. This joint training results in a substantial improvement under closed training conditions, which naturally suggests that applying the same objectives to a broader collection of data will yield further improvements. However, in doing so we uncover a phenomenon whereby our model simultaneously overfits to the supervised data while degenerating on data used for self-supervision only. We demonstrate and investigate this and offer our insights on the underlying problem.

Title: Integrated Polarimetric Sensing and Communication with Polarization-Reconfigurable Arrays
Authors: Byunghyun Lee, Rang Liu, David J. Love, James V. Krogmeier, A. Lee Swindlehurst
Abstract: Polarization diversity offers a cost- and space-efficient solution to enhance the performance of integrated sensing and communication systems. Polarimetric sensing exploits the signal's polarity to extract details about the target such as shape, pose, and material composition. From a communication perspective, polarization diversity can enhance the reliability and throughput of communication channels. This paper proposes an integrated polarimetric sensing and communication (IPSAC) system that jointly conducts polarimetric sensing and communications. We study the use of single-port polarization-reconfigurable antennas to adapt to channel depolarization effects, without the need for separate RF chains for each polarization. We address the problem of optimizing waveforms and polarizations based on two sensing metrics. We first consider minimizing the mean square error (MSE) of the target depolarization parameter estimate, which is a critical task for various polarimetric radar applications such as rainfall forecasting, vegetation identification, and target classification. To address this nonconvex problem, we apply semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and majorization-minimization (MM) optimization techniques. Next, we consider a design that maximizes the target signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) leveraging prior knowledge of the target and clutter depolarization statistics to enhance the target detection performance. To tackle this problem, we modify the solution developed for MSE minimization subject to the same quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. Extensive simulations show that the proposed polarization reconfiguration method substantially improves the depolarization parameter MSE. Furthermore, the proposed method considerably boosts the target SINR due to polarization diversity, particularly in cluttered environments.

Title: Predictor-Based Compensators for Networked Control Systems with Stochastic Delays and Sampling Intervals
Authors: Matheus Wagner, Marcelo M. Morato, Antônio Augusto Fröhlich, Julio E. Normey-Rico
Abstract: The stochastic nature of time delays and sampling intervals in Networked Control Systems poses significant challenges for controller synthesis and analysis, often leading to conservative designs and degraded performance. This work presents a modeling approach for Linear Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Networked Control Systems and introduces a compensation scheme based on the Filtered Smith Predictor to mitigate the adverse effects of stochastic time delays on closed-loop performance. The proposed scheme is evaluated through numerical simulations of a well-established Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control system. Results demonstrate that the compensator achieves near-ideal average closed-loop performance and significantly reduces response variability compared to a traditional Filtered Smith Predictor. Notably, it yields a 45% reduction in worst-case tracking error signal energy relative to an ideal baseline system with no time delays and constant sampling intervals.

Title: Power Flow Analysis of a 5-Bus Power System Based on Newton-Raphson Method
Authors: Sampson E. Nwachukwu
Abstract: Load flow analysis is a fundamental technique used by electrical engineers to simulate and evaluate power system behavior under steady-state conditions. It enables efficient operation and control by determining how active and reactive power flows throughout the system. Selecting an appropriate solution method is critical to ensuring reliable and economical operation of power generation, transmission, and distribution networks. While the conventional loop method may be used in small-scale systems, it is limited by its reliance on impedance-based load data and its inability to scale to complex networks. In contrast, iterative techniques such as the Gauss-Seidel (GS) and Newton-Raphson (NR) methods are better suited for analyzing large systems. Of these, the NR method offers significant advantages due to its quadratic convergence and improved numerical stability. This study presents a power flow analysis of a 5-bus system using the Newton-Raphson approach. The system was modeled and simulated in PowerWorld Simulator (PWS), and a custom MATLAB implementation was developed to verify the results under a base case scenario. The comparative analysis demonstrates that the NR method provides accurate and robust solutions for power flow problems, making it well-suited for evaluating system performance under various operating conditions.

Title: All-Optical Inter-Satellite Relays with Intelligent Beam Control: Harnessing Liquid Lenses and Optical Hard Limiters
Authors: Mohammad Taghi Dabiri, Mazen Hasna, Saud Althunibat, Khalid Qaraqe
Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations are emerging as a key enabler of next-generation communications, offering global coverage and significantly lower latency compared to traditional terrestrial networks and geostationary satellites. However, further latency reduction is essential for time-critical applications such as real-time sensing, autonomous systems, and interactive services. One critical bottleneck is the optical-to-electrical (O/E) and electrical-to-optical (E/O) conversions at intermediate nodes in multi-hop links, which introduce unwanted processing delays. To address this, we investigate an all-optical relay system based on Optical Hard Limiters (OHL), which operate purely in the optical domain to suppress noise and restore signal quality without requiring O/E conversions. First, we present a rigorous analysis of inter-satellite multi-relay communication under the OHL relaying architecture, comparing it against conventional Amplify-and-Forward (AF) and Decode-and-Forward (DF) schemes. Through this comparison, we highlight both the advantages and limitations of OHL relays, including their particular sensitivity to parameter choices such as the threshold setting and divergence angle at the transmitter. Recognizing that a LEO constellation is inherently time-varying - satellites move relative to one another, causing continuous changes in link distances and tracking errors - we propose a joint optimization strategy. This scheme adaptively tunes the OHL decision threshold and beam divergence in real time to maintain optimal performance, ultimately lowering error rates and latency. Extensive simulations in a large-scale LEO network demonstrate the viability of our method and offer insights into practical implementation for next-generation inter-satellite communication systems.

Title: General Signal Model and Capacity Limit for Rydberg Quantum Information System
Authors: Jieao Zhu, Linglong Dai
Abstract: Rydberg atomic receivers represent a transformative approach to achieving high-sensitivity, broadband, and miniaturized radio frequency (RF) reception. However, existing static signal models for Rydberg atomic receivers rely on the steady-state assumption of atomic quantum states, which cannot fully describe the signal reception process of dynamic signals. To fill in this gap, in this paper, we present a general model to compute the dynamic signal response of Rydberg atomic receivers in closed form. Specifically, by applying small-signal perturbation techniques to the quantum master equation, we derive closed-form Laplace domain transfer functions that characterize the receiver's dynamic responses to time-varying signal fields. To gain more insights into the quantum-based RF-photocurrent conversion process, we further introduce the concept of quantum transconductance that describes the quantum system as an equivalent classical system. By applying quantum transconductance, we quantify the influence of in-band blackbody radiation (BBR) noise on the atomic receiver sensitivity. Extensive simulations for Rydberg atomic receivers validate the proposed signal model, and demonstrate the possibility of quantum receivers to outperform classical electronic receivers through the improvement of quantum transconductance.

Title: FD-DiT: Frequency Domain-Directed Diffusion Transformer for Low-Dose CT Reconstruction
Authors: Qiqing Liu, Guoquan Wei, Zekun Zhou, Yiyang Wen, Liu Shi, Qiegen Liu
Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduces radiation exposure but suffers from image artifacts and loss of detail due to quantum and electronic noise, potentially impacting diagnostic accuracy. Transformer combined with diffusion models has been a promising approach for image generation. Nevertheless, existing methods exhibit limitations in preserving finegrained image details. To address this issue, frequency domain-directed diffusion transformer (FD-DiT) is proposed for LDCT reconstruction. FD-DiT centers on a diffusion strategy that progressively introduces noise until the distribution statistically aligns with that of LDCT data, followed by denoising processing. Furthermore, we employ a frequency decoupling technique to concentrate noise primarily in high-frequency domain, thereby facilitating effective capture of essential anatomical structures and fine details. A hybrid denoising network is then utilized to optimize the overall data reconstruction process. To enhance the capability in recognizing high-frequency noise, we incorporate sliding sparse local attention to leverage the sparsity and locality of shallow-layer information, propagating them via skip connections for improving feature representation. Finally, we propose a learnable dynamic fusion strategy for optimal component integration. Experimental results demonstrate that at identical dose levels, LDCT images reconstructed by FD-DiT exhibit superior noise and artifact suppression compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Automatic Phase Calibration for High-resolution mmWave Sensing via Ambient Radio Anchors
Authors: Ruixu Geng, Yadong Li, Dongheng Zhang, Pengcheng Huang, Binquan Wang, Binbin Zhang, Zhi Lu, Yang Hu, Yan Chen
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar systems with large array have pushed radar sensing into a new era, thanks to their high angular resolution. However, our long-term experiments indicate that array elements exhibit phase drift over time and require periodic phase calibration to maintain high-resolution, creating an obstacle for practical high-resolution mmWave sensing. Unfortunately, existing calibration methods are inadequate for periodic recalibration, either because they rely on artificial references or fail to provide sufficient precision. To address this challenge, we introduce AutoCalib, the first framework designed to automatically and accurately calibrate high-resolution mmWave radars by identifying Ambient Radio Anchors (ARAs)-naturally existing objects in ambient environments that offer stable phase references. AutoCalib achieves calibration by first generating spatial spectrum templates based on theoretical electromagnetic characteristics. It then employs a pattern-matching and scoring mechanism to accurately detect these anchors and select the optimal one for calibration. Extensive experiments across 11 environments demonstrate that AutoCalib capable of identifying ARAs that existing methods miss due to their focus on strong reflectors. AutoCalib's calibration performance approaches corner reflectors (74% phase error reduction) while outperforming existing methods by 83%. Beyond radar calibration, AutoCalib effectively supports other phase-dependent applications like handheld imaging, delivering 96% of corner reflector calibration performance without artificial references.

Title: Cooperative Sensing in Cell-free Massive MIMO ISAC Systems: Performance Optimization and Signal Processing
Authors: Haotian Liu, Zhiqing Wei, Luyang Sun, Ruizhong Xu, Yixin Zhang, Zhiyong Feng
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), as a technology enabled seamless connection between communication and sensing, is regarded a core enabling technology for these applications. However, the accuracy of single-node sensing in ISAC system is limited, prompting the emergence of multi-node cooperative sensing. In multi-node cooperative sensing, the synchronization error limits the sensing accuracy, which can be mitigated by the architecture of cell-free massive multi-input multi-output (CF-mMIMO), since the multiple nodes are interconnected via optical fibers with high synchronization accuracy. However, the multi-node cooperative sensing in CF-mMIMO ISAC systems faces the following challenges: 1) The joint optimization of placement and resource allocation of distributed access points (APs) to improve the sensing performance in multi-target detection scenario is difficult; 2) The fusion of the sensing information from distributed APs with multi-view discrepancies is difficult. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a joint placement and antenna resource optimization scheme for distributed APs to minimize the sensing Cramr-Rao bound for targets' parameters within the area of interest. Then, a symbol-level fusion-based multi-dynamic target sensing (SL-MDTS) scheme is provided, effectively fusing sensing information from multiple APs. The simulation results validate the effectiveness of the joint optimization scheme and the superiority of the SL-MDTS scheme. Compared to state-of-the-art grid-based symbol-level sensing information fusion schemes, the proposed SL-MDTS scheme improves the accuracy of localization and velocity estimation by 44 % and 41.4 %, respectively.

Title: UltraTwin: Towards Cardiac Anatomical Twin Generation from Multi-view 2D Ultrasound

Abstract: Echocardiography is routine for cardiac examination. However, 2D ultrasound (US) struggles with accurate metric calculation and direct observation of 3D cardiac structures. Moreover, 3D US is limited by low resolution, small field of view and scarce availability in practice. Constructing the cardiac anatomical twin from 2D images is promising to provide precise treatment planning and clinical quantification. However, it remains challenging due to the rare paired data, complex structures, and US noises. In this study, we introduce a novel generative framework UltraTwin, to obtain cardiac anatomical twin from sparse multi-view 2D US. Our contribution is three-fold. First, pioneered the construction of a real-world and high-quality dataset containing strictly paired multi-view 2D US and CT, and pseudo-paired data. Second, we propose a coarse-to-fine scheme to achieve hierarchical reconstruction optimization. Last, we introduce an implicit autoencoder for topology-aware constraints. Extensive experiments show that UltraTwin reconstructs high-quality anatomical twins versus strong competitors. We believe it advances anatomical twin modeling for potential applications in personalized cardiac care.

Title: Far-Field vs. Near-Field Propagation Channels: Key Differences and Impact on 6G XL-MIMO Performance Evaluation
Authors: Zihang Ding, Jianhua Zhang, Changsheng You, Pan Tang, Hongbo Xing, Zhiqiang Yuan, Jie Meng, Guangyi Liu
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is regarded as a promising technology for next-generation communication systems. However, this will expand the near-field (NF) range, rendering more users more likely to be located in the NF region. In this paper, we aim to answer two questions: What are the new characteristics of the NF channel? Is it necessary to develop new transciver techniques to maintain system performance within the NF region? To this end, we first review current NF channel models and analyze the differences between the existing 3GPP TR 38.901 channel model and the NF channel model, including the spherical wavefront and spatially non-stationarity. Then, we provide examples on how these differences affect the XL-MIMO system performance in terms of beamforming gain and achievable rate. Simulation results demonstrate that, when using far-field (FF) technique under the NF channel, the maximum normalized beam gain loss is less than 3 dB for most users in the NF region defined by Rayleigh distance. Moreover, the achievable rate loss of beam training is less than 3% compared to that realized by NF technique. Finally, we demonstrate the necessity of employing NF transceiver techniques based on simulation results.

Title: Artificial Intelligence-assisted Pixel-level Lung (APL) Scoring for Fast and Accurate Quantification in Ultra-short Echo-time MRI
Authors: Bowen Xin, Rohan Hickey, Tamara Blake, Jin Jin, Claire E Wainwright, Thomas Benkert, Alto Stemmer, Peter Sly, David Coman, Jason Dowling
Abstract: Lung magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with ultrashort echo-time (UTE) represents a recent breakthrough in lung structure imaging, providing image resolution and quality comparable to computed tomography (CT). Due to the absence of ionising radiation, MRI is often preferred over CT in paediatric diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF), one of the most common genetic disorders in Caucasians. To assess structural lung damage in CF imaging, CT scoring systems provide valuable quantitative insights for disease diagnosis and progression. However, few quantitative scoring systems are available in structural lung MRI (e.g., UTE-MRI). To provide fast and accurate quantification in lung MRI, we investigated the feasibility of novel Artificial intelligence-assisted Pixel-level Lung (APL) scoring for CF. APL scoring consists of 5 stages, including 1) image loading, 2) AI lung segmentation, 3) lung-bounded slice sampling, 4) pixel-level annotation, and 5) quantification and reporting. The results shows that our APL scoring took 8.2 minutes per subject, which was more than twice as fast as the previous grid-level scoring. Additionally, our pixel-level scoring was statistically more accurate (p=0.021), while strongly correlating with grid-level scoring (R=0.973, p=5.85e-9). This tool has great potential to streamline the workflow of UTE lung MRI in clinical settings, and be extended to other structural lung MRI sequences (e.g., BLADE MRI), and for other lung diseases (e.g., bronchopulmonary dysplasia).

Title: Power-Gas Infrastructure Planning under Weather-induced Supply and Demand Uncertainties
Authors: Rahman Khorramfar, Dharik Mallapragada, Saurabh Amin
Abstract: Implementing economy-wide decarbonization strategies based on decarbonizing the power grid via variable renewable energy (VRE) expansion and electrification of end-uses requires new approaches for energy infrastructure planning that consider, among other factors, weather-induced uncertainty in demand and VRE supply. An energy planning model that fails to account for these uncertainties can hinder the intended transition efforts to a low-carbon grid and increase the risk of supply shortage especially during extreme weather conditions. Here, we consider the generation and transmission expansion problem of joint power-gas infrastructure and operations planning under the uncertainty of both demand and renewable supply. We propose two distributionally robust optimization approaches based on moment (MDRO) and Wasserstein distance (WDRO) ambiguity sets to endogenize these uncertainties and account for the change in the underlying distribution of these parameters that is caused by the climate change, among other factors. Furthermore, our model considers the risk-aversion of the energy planners in the modeling framework via the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) metric. An equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) reformulation of both modeling frameworks is presented, and a computationally efficient approximation scheme to obtain near-optimal solutions is proposed. We demonstrate the resulting DRO planning models and solution strategy via a New England case study under different levels of end-use electrification and decarbonization targets. Our experiments systematically explore different modeling aspects and compare the DRO models with stochastic programming (SP) results.

Title: Mutli-Level Autoencoder: Deep Learning Based Channel Coding and Modulation
Authors: Ahmad Abdel-Qader, Anas Chaaban, Mohamed S. Shehata
Abstract: In this paper, we design a deep learning-based convolutional autoencoder for channel coding and modulation. The objective is to develop an adaptive scheme capable of operating at various signal-to-noise ratios (SNR)s without the need for re-training. Additionally, the proposed framework allows validation by testing all possible codes in the codebook, as opposed to previous AI-based encoder/decoder frameworks which relied on testing only a small subset of the available codes. This limitation in earlier methods often led to unreliable conclusions when generalized to larger codebooks. In contrast to previous methods, our multi-level encoding and decoding approach splits the message into blocks, where each encoder block processes a distinct group of $B$ bits. By doing so, the proposed scheme can exhaustively test $2^{B}$ possible codewords for each encoder/decoder level, constituting a layer of the overall scheme. The proposed model was compared to classical polar codes and TurboAE-MOD schemes, showing improved reliability with achieving comparable, or even superior results in some settings. Notably, the architecture can adapt to different SNRs by selectively removing one of the encoder/decoder layers without re-training, thus demonstrating flexibility and efficiency in practical wireless communication scenarios.

Title: Sensing for Free: Learn to Localize More Sources than Antennas without Pilots
Authors: Wentao Yu, Khaled B. Letaief, Lizhong Zheng
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) represents a key paradigm for future wireless networks. However, existing approaches require waveform modifications, dedicated pilots, or overhead that complicates standards integration. We propose sensing for free - performing multi-source localization without pilots by reusing uplink data symbols, making sensing occur during transmission and directly compatible with 3GPP 5G NR and 6G specifications. With ever-increasing devices in dense 6G networks, this approach is particularly compelling when combined with sparse arrays, which can localize more sources than uniform arrays via an enlarged virtual array. Existing pilot-free multi-source localization algorithms first reconstruct an extended covariance matrix and apply subspace methods, incurring cubic complexity and limited to second-order statistics. Performance degrades under non-Gaussian data symbols and few snapshots, and higher-order statistics remain unexploited. We address these challenges with an attention-only transformer that directly processes raw signal snapshots for grid-less end-to-end direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. The model efficiently captures higher-order statistics while being permutation-invariant and adaptive to varying snapshot counts. Our algorithm greatly outperforms state-of-the-art AI-based benchmarks with over 30x reduction in parameters and runtime, and enjoys excellent generalization under practical mismatches. Applied to multi-user MIMO beam training, our algorithm can localize uplink DOAs of multiple users during data transmission. Through angular reciprocity, estimated uplink DOAs prune downlink beam sweeping candidates and improve throughput via sensing-assisted beam management. This work shows how reusing existing data transmission for sensing can enhance both multi-source localization and beam management in 3GPP efforts towards 6G.

Title: AFUNet: Cross-Iterative Alignment-Fusion Synergy for HDR Reconstruction via Deep Unfolding Paradigm
Authors: Xinyue Li, Zhangkai Ni, Wenhan Yang
Abstract: Existing learning-based methods effectively reconstruct HDR images from multi-exposure LDR inputs with extended dynamic range and improved detail, but they rely more on empirical design rather than theoretical foundation, which can impact their reliability. To address these limitations, we propose the cross-iterative Alignment and Fusion deep Unfolding Network (AFUNet), where HDR reconstruction is systematically decoupled into two interleaved subtasks -- alignment and fusion -- optimized through alternating refinement, achieving synergy between the two subtasks to enhance the overall performance. Our method formulates multi-exposure HDR reconstruction from a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation perspective, explicitly incorporating spatial correspondence priors across LDR images and naturally bridging the alignment and fusion subproblems through joint constraints. Building on the mathematical foundation, we reimagine traditional iterative optimization through unfolding -- transforming the conventional solution process into an end-to-end trainable AFUNet with carefully designed modules that work progressively. Specifically, each iteration of AFUNet incorporates an Alignment-Fusion Module (AFM) that alternates between a Spatial Alignment Module (SAM) for alignment and a Channel Fusion Module (CFM) for adaptive feature fusion, progressively bridging misaligned content and exposure discrepancies. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate AFUNet's superior performance, consistently surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at: this https URL

Title: Human-CLAP: Human-perception-based contrastive language-audio pretraining
Authors: Taisei Takano, Yuki Okamoto, Yusuke Kanamori, Yuki Saito, Ryotaro Nagase, Hiroshi Saruwatari
Abstract: Contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) is widely used for audio generation and recognition tasks. For example, CLAPScore, which utilizes the similarity of CLAP embeddings, has been a major metric for the evaluation of the relevance between audio and text in text-to-audio. However, the relationship between CLAPScore and human subjective evaluation scores is still unclarified. We show that CLAPScore has a low correlation with human subjective evaluation scores. Additionally, we propose a human-perception-based CLAP called Human-CLAP by training a contrastive language-audio model using the subjective evaluation score. In our experiments, the results indicate that our Human-CLAP improved the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) between the CLAPScore and the subjective evaluation scores by more than 0.25 compared with the conventional CLAP.

Title: A Bidirectional Power Router for Traceable Multi-energy Management
Authors: Shiu Mochiyama, Ryo Takahashi, Yoshihiko Susuki
Abstract: To address challenges in improving self-consumption of renewables and resilience in local residential power systems, the earlier work of the authors introduced a novel multi-energy management concept, integrating bidirectional power routing and electricity-hydrogen conversion. This paper focuses on an experimental verification of the bidirectional power router based on line-switching, the essential hardware to realize the concept. The primary contribution is the validation of the router's capability to handle dynamic change of bidirectional power flow. Furthermore, to achieve bidirectional power routing without affecting the smooth and stable operation of the power system, a novel algorithm for router's switching is designed based on power flow monitoring. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through an experiment using a setup with a commercially available stationary battery.

Title: Data-Driven Modulation Optimization with LMMSE Equalization for Reliability Enhancement in Underwater Acoustic Communications
Authors: Xuehan Wang, Hengyu Zhang, Jintao Wang, Zhi Sun, Bo Ai
Abstract: Ultra-reliable underwater acoustic (UWA) communications serve as one of the key enabling technologies for future space-air-ground-underwater integrated networks. However, the reliability of current UWA transmission is still insufficient since severe performance degradation occurs for conventional multicarrier systems in UWA channels with severe delay-scale spread. To solve this problem, we exploit learning-inspired approaches to optimize the modulation scheme under the assumption of linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) equalization, where the discrete representation of waveforms is adopted by utilizing Nyquist filters. The optimization problem is first transferred into maximizing the fairness of estimation mean square error (MSE) for each data symbol since the total MSE is invariant considering the property of orthogonal modulation. The Siamese architecture is then adopted to obtain consistent optimization results across various channel conditions, which avoids the overhead of online feedback, cooperation, and deployment of neural networks and guarantees generalization. The overall scheme including the loss function, neural network structure, and training process is also investigated in depth in this paper. The excellent performance and robustness of the proposed modulation scheme are verified by carrying out the bit error rate test over various UWA channels with severe delay-scale spread.

Title: A Fast and Accurate 3-D Reconstruction Algorithm for Near-Range Microwave Imaging with Handheld Synthetic Aperture Radar
Authors: Lei Wang, Xianxun Yao, Tiancheng Song, Guolin Sun
Abstract: The design of image reconstruction algorithms for near-range handheld synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems has gained increasing popularity due to the promising performance of portable millimeter-wave (MMW) imaging devices in various application fields. Time domain imaging algorithms including the backprojection algorithm (BPA) and the Kirchhoff migration algorithm (KMA) are widely adopted due to their direct applicability to arbitrary scan trajectories. However, they suffer from time complexity issues that hinder their practical application. Wavenumber domain algorithms greatly improve the computational efficiency but most of them are restricted to specific array topologies. Based on the factorization techniques as adopted in far-field synthetic aperture radar imaging, the time domain fast factorized backprojection algorithm for handheld synthetic aperture radar (HHFFBPA) is proposed. The local spectral properties of the radar images for handheld systems are analyzed and analytical spectrum compression techniques are derived to realize efficient sampling of the subimages. Validated through numerical simulations and experiments, HHFFBPA achieves fast and accurate 3-D imaging for handheld synthetic aperture radar systems with arbitrary trajectories.

Title: A Clinically-Grounded Two-Stage Framework for Renal CT Report Generation
Authors: Renjie Liang, Zhengkang Fan, Jinqian Pan, Chenkun Sun, Russell Terry, Jie Xu
Abstract: Generating radiology reports from CT scans remains a complex task due to the nuanced nature of medical imaging and the variability in clinical documentation. In this study, we propose a two-stage framework for generating renal radiology reports from 2D CT slices. First, we extract structured abnormality features using a multi-task learning model trained to identify lesion attributes such as location, size, enhancement, and attenuation. These extracted features are subsequently combined with the corresponding CT image and fed into a fine-tuned vision-language model to generate natural language report sentences aligned with clinical findings. We conduct experiments on a curated dataset of renal CT studies with manually annotated sentence-slice-feature triplets and evaluate performance using both classification metrics and natural language generation metrics. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms random baselines across all abnormality types, and the generated reports capture key clinical content with reasonable textual accuracy. This exploratory work highlights the feasibility of modular, feature-informed report generation for renal imaging. Future efforts will focus on extending this pipeline to 3D CT volumes and further improving clinical fidelity in multimodal medical AI systems.

Title: Wireless Propagation Parameter Estimation with Convolutional Neural Networks
Authors: Steffen Schieler, Sebastian Semper, Reiner Thomä
Abstract: Wireless channel propagation parameter estimation forms the foundation of channel sounding, estimation, modeling, and sensing. This paper introduces a Deep Learning approach for joint delay- and Doppler estimation from frequency and time samples of a radio channel transfer function. Our work estimates the two-dimensional path parameters from a channel impulse response containing an unknown number of paths. Compared to existing deep learning-based methods, the parameters are not estimated via classification but in a quasi-grid-free manner. We employ a deterministic preprocessing scheme that incorporates a multi-channel windowing to increase the estimator's robustness and enables the use of a CNN architecture. The proposed architecture then jointly estimates the number of paths along with the respective delay and Doppler-shift parameters of the paths. Hence, it jointly solves the model order selection and parameter estimation task. We also integrate the CNN into an existing maximum-likelihood estimator framework for efficient initialization of a gradient-based iteration, to provide more accurate estimates. In the analysis, we compare our approach to other methods in terms of estimate accuracy and model order error on synthetic data. Finally, we demonstrate its applicability to real-world measurement data from a anechoic bi-static RADAR emulation measurement.

Title: Reliability Assessment of Power System Based on the Dichotomy Method
Authors: Wenjie Wan, Han Hu, Feiyu Chen, Xiaoyu Liu, Kequan Zhao
Abstract: With a sustainable increase in the scale of power system, the number of states in the state space grows exponentially, and the reliability assessment of the power system faces enormous challenges. Traditional state-by-state assessment methods, such as state enumeration (SE) and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) methods, have encountered performance bottlenecks in terms of efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, the Boolean lattice representation theory of the state space was studied, and a dichotomy method was proposed to efficiently partition the state space into some disjoint sub-lattices with a relatively small number of optimal power flow (OPF) operations. Based on lattice partition, the reliability indices of the entire space can be calculated lattice-by-lattice. In addition, alone with the partitioning procedure, the calculated loss of load probability (LOLP) monotonically increases and rapidly tends to the analytic value with the designated error bound. Moreover, we designed a customized Monte Carlo sampling method in lattices of interest to compute expected energy not supply (EENS). The experiments are conducted on the RBTS and RTS-79 systems. The results show that the proposed method achieves the analytic LOLP of the RBTS system after five hundreds of OPF operations, which is about hundreds of times faster than traditional methods, and the designed Monte Carlo sampling method converged after thousands of OPF operations on test systems.

Title: Diffusion Model-based Data Augmentation Method for Fetal Head Ultrasound Segmentation
Authors: Fangyijie Wang, Kevin Whelan, Félix Balado, Guénolé Silvestre, Kathleen M. Curran
Abstract: Medical image data is less accessible than in other domains due to privacy and regulatory constraints. In addition, labeling requires costly, time-intensive manual image annotation by clinical experts. To overcome these challenges, synthetic medical data generation offers a promising solution. Generative AI (GenAI), employing generative deep learning models, has proven effective at producing realistic synthetic images. This study proposes a novel mask-guided GenAI approach using diffusion models to generate synthetic fetal head ultrasound images paired with segmentation masks. These synthetic pairs augment real datasets for supervised fine-tuning of the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Our results show that the synthetic data captures real image features effectively, and this approach reaches state-of-the-art fetal head segmentation, especially when trained with a limited number of real image-mask pairs. In particular, the segmentation reaches Dice Scores of 94.66\% and 94.38\% using a handful of ultrasound images from the Spanish and African cohorts, respectively. Our code, models, and data are available on GitHub.

Title: GUSL: A Novel and Efficient Machine Learning Model for Prostate Segmentation on MRI
Authors: Jiaxin Yang, Vasileios Magoulianitis, Catherine Aurelia Christie Alexander, Jintang Xue, Masatomo Kaneko, Giovanni Cacciamani, Andre Abreu, Vinay Duddalwar, C.-C. Jay Kuo, Inderbir S. Gill, Chrysostomos Nikias
Abstract: Prostate and zonal segmentation is a crucial step for clinical diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa). Computer-aided diagnosis tools for prostate segmentation are based on the deep learning (DL) paradigm. However, deep neural networks are perceived as "black-box" solutions by physicians, thus making them less practical for deployment in the clinical setting. In this paper, we introduce a feed-forward machine learning model, named Green U-shaped Learning (GUSL), suitable for medical image segmentation without backpropagation. GUSL introduces a multi-layer regression scheme for coarse-to-fine segmentation. Its feature extraction is based on a linear model, which enables seamless interpretability during feature extraction. Also, GUSL introduces a mechanism for attention on the prostate boundaries, which is an error-prone region, by employing regression to refine the predictions through residue correction. In addition, a two-step pipeline approach is used to mitigate the class imbalance, an issue inherent in medical imaging problems. After conducting experiments on two publicly available datasets and one private dataset, in both prostate gland and zonal segmentation tasks, GUSL achieves state-of-the-art performance among other DL-based models. Notably, GUSL features a very energy-efficient pipeline, since it has a model size several times smaller and less complexity than the rest of the solutions. In all datasets, GUSL achieved a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) performance greater than $0.9$ for gland segmentation. Considering also its lightweight model size and transparency in feature extraction, it offers a competitive and practical package for medical imaging applications.

Title: MedSAM-CA: A CNN-Augmented ViT with Attention-Enhanced Multi-Scale Fusion for Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Peiting Tian, Xi Chen, Haixia Bi, Fan Li
Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis and treatment planning, where accurate boundary delineation is essential for precise lesion localization, organ identification, and quantitative assessment. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have significantly advanced segmentation accuracy. However, two major challenges remain. First, the performance of these methods heavily relies on large-scale annotated datasets, which are often difficult to obtain in medical scenarios due to privacy concerns and high annotation costs. Second, clinically challenging scenarios, such as low contrast in certain imaging modalities and blurry lesion boundaries caused by malignancy, still pose obstacles to precise segmentation. To address these challenges, we propose MedSAM-CA, an architecture-level fine-tuning approach that mitigates reliance on extensive manual annotations by adapting the pretrained foundation model, Medical Segment Anything (MedSAM). MedSAM-CA introduces two key components: the Convolutional Attention-Enhanced Boundary Refinement Network (CBR-Net) and the Attention-Enhanced Feature Fusion Block (Atte-FFB). CBR-Net operates in parallel with the MedSAM encoder to recover boundary information potentially overlooked by long-range attention mechanisms, leveraging hierarchical convolutional processing. Atte-FFB, embedded in the MedSAM decoder, fuses multi-level fine-grained features from skip connections in CBR-Net with global representations upsampled within the decoder to enhance boundary delineation accuracy. Experiments on publicly available datasets covering dermoscopy, CT, and MRI imaging modalities validate the effectiveness of MedSAM-CA. On dermoscopy dataset, MedSAM-CA achieves 94.43% Dice with only 2% of full training data, reaching 97.25% of full-data training performance, demonstrating strong effectiveness in low-resource clinical settings.

Title: MDPG: Multi-domain Diffusion Prior Guidance for MRI Reconstruction
Authors: Lingtong Zhang, Mengdie Song, Xiaohan Hao, Huayu Mai, Bensheng Qiu
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction is essential in medical diagnostics. As the latest generative models, diffusion models (DMs) have struggled to produce high-fidelity images due to their stochastic nature in image domains. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) yield both compact and detailed prior knowledge in latent domains, which could effectively guide the model towards more effective learning of the original data distribution. Inspired by this, we propose Multi-domain Diffusion Prior Guidance (MDPG) provided by pre-trained LDMs to enhance data consistency in MRI reconstruction tasks. Specifically, we first construct a Visual-Mamba-based backbone, which enables efficient encoding and reconstruction of under-sampled images. Then pre-trained LDMs are integrated to provide conditional priors in both latent and image domains. A novel Latent Guided Attention (LGA) is proposed for efficient fusion in multi-level latent domains. Simultaneously, to effectively utilize a prior in both the k-space and image domain, under-sampled images are fused with generated full-sampled images by the Dual-domain Fusion Branch (DFB) for self-adaption guidance. Lastly, to further enhance the data consistency, we propose a k-space regularization strategy based on the non-auto-calibration signal (NACS) set. Extensive experiments on two public MRI datasets fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The code is available at this https URL.

Title: A Data-Ensemble-Based Approach for Sample-Efficient LQ Control of Linear Time-Varying Systems
Authors: Sahel Vahedi Noori, Maryam Babazadeh
Abstract: This paper presents a sample-efficient, data-driven control framework for finite-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) control of linear time-varying (LTV) systems. In contrast to the time-invariant case, the time-varying LQ problem involves a differential Riccati equation (DRE) with time-dependent parameters and terminal boundary constraints. We formulate the LQ problem as a nonconvex optimization problem and conduct a rigorous analysis of its dual structure. By exploiting the inherent convexity of the dual problem and analyzing the KKT conditions, we derive an explicit relationship between the optimal dual solution and the parameters of the associated Q-function in time-varying case. This theoretical insight supports the development of a novel, sample-efficient, non-iterative semidefinite programming (SDP) algorithm that directly computes the optimal sequence of feedback gains from an ensemble of input-state data sequences without model identification. The resulting convex, data-dependent framework provides global optimality guarantees for completely unknown LTV systems. As a special case, the method also applies to finite-horizon LQ control of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. In this setting, a single input-state trajectory suffices to identify the optimal LQ feedback policy, improving significantly over existing Q-learning approaches for finite horizon LTI systems that typically require data from multiple episodes. The approach provides a new optimization-based perspective on Q-learning in time-varying settings and contributes to the broader understanding of data-driven control in non-stationary environments. Simulation results show that, compared to recent methods, the proposed approach achieves superior optimality and sample efficiency on LTV systems, and indicates potential for stabilizing and optimal control of nonlinear systems.

Title: Deep Learning-Based Semantic Segmentation for Real-Time Kidney Imaging and Measurements with Augmented Reality-Assisted Ultrasound
Authors: Gijs Luijten, Roberto Maria Scardigno, Lisle Faray de Paiva, Peter Hoyer, Jens Kleesiek, Domenico Buongiorno, Vitoantonio Bevilacqua, Jan Egger
Abstract: Ultrasound (US) is widely accessible and radiation-free but has a steep learning curve due to its dynamic nature and non-standard imaging planes. Additionally, the constant need to shift focus between the US screen and the patient poses a challenge. To address these issues, we integrate deep learning (DL)-based semantic segmentation for real-time (RT) automated kidney volumetric measurements, which are essential for clinical assessment but are traditionally time-consuming and prone to fatigue. This automation allows clinicians to concentrate on image interpretation rather than manual measurements. Complementing DL, augmented reality (AR) enhances the usability of US by projecting the display directly into the clinician's field of view, improving ergonomics and reducing the cognitive load associated with screen-to-patient transitions. Two AR-DL-assisted US pipelines on HoloLens-2 are proposed: one streams directly via the application programming interface for a wireless setup, while the other supports any US device with video output for broader accessibility. We evaluate RT feasibility and accuracy using the Open Kidney Dataset and open-source segmentation models (nnU-Net, Segmenter, YOLO with MedSAM and LiteMedSAM). Our open-source GitHub pipeline includes model implementations, measurement algorithms, and a Wi-Fi-based streaming solution, enhancing US training and diagnostics, especially in point-of-care settings.

Title: A Digital Twinning Approach to Decarbonisation: Research Challenges
Authors: Blair Archibald, Paul Harvey, Michele Sevegnani
Abstract: Transportation accounts for around 27% of green house gas emissions in the UK. While an obvious priority area for decarbonisation, and aligned to the UK government goal of reducing emissions by 68% for 2030, the free-market nature of the transportation sector combined with its fundamentally implicit and pervasive connections to all aspects of society and national infrastructure mean that all decarbonisation efforts to date have been siloed within a single transport sector, e.g. only considering greener aviation fuels. Truly decarbonising transport requires radical changes to the entire transport infrastructure, and since that transport does not happen in isolation, a single user often using multiple modes, we need a view over the whole transport system. The first step to solving a problem is to understand it. As a result of the fragmented nature of the transportation sector, there is currently no system level view. Without the ability to monitor even adjacent transport domains, the ability for people or organisations to (dynamically) adapt their operations for decarbonisation outcomes is unrealistic. As transportation is a complex social-techno-economic system, information and knowledge sharing is a must to be able to understand and explore potential solutions to the decarbonisation challenge. We believe a Federated Digital Twinning Approach has the potential to tackle transport decarbonisation problems, and, in this extended abstract, we give an overview of the research required to tackle the fundamental challenges around digital twin design, generation, validation and verification.

Title: On sample-based functional observability of linear systems
Authors: Isabelle Krauss, Victor G. Lopez, Matthias A. Müller
Abstract: Sample-based observability characterizes the ability to reconstruct the internal state of a dynamical system by using limited output information, i.e., when measurements are only infrequently and/or irregularly available. In this work, we investigate the concept of functional observability, which refers to the ability to infer a function of the system state from the outputs, within a samplebased framework. Here, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a system to be sample-based functionally observable, and formulate conditions on the sampling schemes such that these are satisfied. Furthermore, we provide a numerical example, where we demonstrate the applicability of the obtained results.

Title: Wideband Coverage Enhancement for IRS-Aided Wireless Networks Based on Power Measurement
Authors: Ge Yan, Lipeng Zhu, He Sun, Rui Zhang
Abstract: By applying tunable phase shifts to incident waves via passive signal reflection, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) can offer significant performance improvement for wireless communication systems. To reap such performance gain, channel knowledge for IRS-cascaded links is generally required, which is practically challenging to acquire due to their high-dimensional and time-varying characteristics. Conventional pilot-based channel estimation incurs excessive overhead due to the large number of reflecting elements, thus undermining the IRS efficiency, especially for wideband systems with frequency-selective fading channels. To tackle this issue, we propose in this letter a power-measurement-based channel autocorrelation matrix estimation and coverage enhancement approach for IRS-aided orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Specifically, by estimating equivalent channel autocorrelation matrices of IRS-cascaded OFDM channels based on receive signal power and optimizing the IRS reflection vector based on them, the average coverage performance in the IRS-aided region is enhanced without the need for frequent reconfiguration of IRS reflection coefficients based on user instantaneous channels. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for improving the average channel gain over the coverage region.

Title: Spatio-Temporal Representation Decoupling and Enhancement for Federated Instrument Segmentation in Surgical Videos
Authors: Zheng Fang, Xiaoming Qi, Chun-Mei Feng, Jialun Pei, Weixin Si, Yueming Jin
Abstract: Surgical instrument segmentation under Federated Learning (FL) is a promising direction, which enables multiple surgical sites to collaboratively train the model without centralizing datasets. However, there exist very limited FL works in surgical data science, and FL methods for other modalities do not consider inherent characteristics in surgical domain: i) different scenarios show diverse anatomical backgrounds while highly similar instrument representation; ii) there exist surgical simulators which promote large-scale synthetic data generation with minimal efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel Personalized FL scheme, Spatio-Temporal Representation Decoupling and Enhancement (FedST), which wisely leverages surgical domain knowledge during both local-site and global-server training to boost segmentation. Concretely, our model embraces a Representation Separation and Cooperation (RSC) mechanism in local-site training, which decouples the query embedding layer to be trained privately, to encode respective backgrounds. Meanwhile, other parameters are optimized globally to capture the consistent representations of instruments, including the temporal layer to capture similar motion patterns. A textual-guided channel selection is further designed to highlight site-specific features, facilitating model adapta tion to each site. Moreover, in global-server training, we propose Synthesis-based Explicit Representation Quantification (SERQ), which defines an explicit representation target based on synthetic data to synchronize the model convergence during fusion for improving model generalization.

Title: Active Estimation of Multiplicative Faults in Dynamical Systems
Authors: Gabriel de Albuquerque Gleizer, Peyman Mohajerin Esfahani, Tamas Keviczky
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of estimating multiplicative fault signals in linear time-invariant systems by processing its input and output variables, as well as designing an input signal to maximize the accuracy of such estimates. The proposed real-time fault estimator is based on a residual generator used for fault detection and a multiple-output regressor generator, which feed a moving-horizon linear regression that estimates the parameter changes. Asymptotic performance guarantees are provided in the presence of noise. Motivated by the performance bounds, an optimal input design problem is formulated, for which we provide efficient algorithms and optimality bounds. Numerical examples demonstrate the efficacy of our approach and the importance of the optimal input design for accurate fault estimation.

Title: E-WAN: Efficient Communication in Energy Harvesting Low-Power Networks
Authors: Naomi Stricker, David Blaser, Andres Gomez, Lothar Thiele
Abstract: The ever-increasing number of distributed embedded systems in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) rely on wireless communication to collect and exchange data. Nodes can employ single-hop communication which, despite its ease, may necessitate energy-intensive long-range communication to cover long distances. Conversely, multi-hop communication allows for more energy-efficient short-range communication since nodes can rely on other nodes to forward their data. Yet, this approach requires relay nodes to be available and continuous maintenance of a dynamically changing distributed state. At the same time, energy harvesting has the potential to outperform traditional battery-based systems by improving their lifetime, scalability with lower maintenance costs, and environmental impact. However, the limited and temporally and spatially variable harvested energy poses significant challenges for networking in energy harvesting networks, particularly considering the energy demands and characteristics of both multi-hop and single-hop communication. We propose E-WAN, a protocol for energy harvesting wide-area low-power networks that builds on the concept of \emph{virtual sub-networks} to enable resource-efficient multi-hop communication when possible and reliable however energy-intensive point-to-point communication otherwise. Nodes autonomously and dynamically move between the two and adjust to changing network states and resources based only on easily obtainable network state information. We illustrate E-WAN's advantages both in terms of efficiency and adaptability in various communication and harvesting scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate E-WAN operating in a realistic setting by deploying an energy harvesting network in a real-world indoor environment.

Title: Statistical Modeling for Accurate Characterization of Doppler Effect in LEO-Terrestrial Networks
Authors: Islam M. Tanash, Risto Wichman, Nuria Gonzalez-Prelcic
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite communication is a promising solution for global wireless coverage, especially in underserved and remote areas. However, the high relative velocity of LEO satellites induces significant Doppler shifts that disrupt subcarrier orthogonality and degrade multicarrier system performance. While the common time-varying Doppler shift can be compensated relative to a reference point, the residual differential Doppler across users within the coverage cell remains a significant challenge, causing severe intercarrier interference. This paper presents a generalized analytical framework for characterizing both the Doppler shift magnitude and the differential Doppler in LEO systems. Unlike prior works limited by flat-Earth assumptions or specific orbital configurations, our model incorporates Earth's curvature and supports arbitrary elevation angles. Using spherical geometry, we derive closed-form expressions for Doppler shift based on the central angle between the satellite and ground users. We further provide a statistical characterization of both the Doppler shift magnitude and the differential Doppler in terms of their cumulative distribution function (CDF) and probability density function (PDF) for uniformly distributed users within a spherical cap cell. Additionally, we derive a tight upper bound for the Doppler shift CDF and an exact expression for the maximum differential Doppler experienced across the coverage region. To mitigate intra-cell Doppler variation, we implement a user clustering technique that partitions the coverage area based on a Doppler disparity threshold into spherical sub-cells, ensuring compliance with 3GPP tolerances. Extensive simulations over realistic satellite constellations validate our analysis and reveal the impact of altitude, beamwidth, and satellite-user geometry on Doppler behavior.

Title: Less is More: Data Curation Matters in Scaling Speech Enhancement
Authors: Chenda Li, Wangyou Zhang, Wei Wang, Robin Scheibler, Kohei Saijo, Samuele Cornell, Yihui Fu, Marvin Sach, Zhaoheng Ni, Anurag Kumar, Tim Fingscheidt, Shinji Watanabe, Yanmin Qian
Abstract: The vast majority of modern speech enhancement systems rely on data-driven neural network models. Conventionally, larger datasets are presumed to yield superior model performance, an observation empirically validated across numerous tasks in other domains. However, recent studies reveal diminishing returns when scaling speech enhancement data. We focus on a critical factor: prevalent quality issues in ``clean'' training labels within large-scale datasets. This work re-examines this phenomenon and demonstrates that, within large-scale training sets, prioritizing high-quality training data is more important than merely expanding the data volume. Experimental findings suggest that models trained on a carefully curated subset of 700 hours can outperform models trained on the 2,500-hour full dataset. This outcome highlights the crucial role of data curation in scaling speech enhancement systems effectively.

Title: URGENT-PK: Perceptually-Aligned Ranking Model Designed for Speech Enhancement Competition
Authors: Jiahe Wang, Chenda Li, Wei Wang, Wangyou Zhang, Samuele Cornell, Marvin Sach, Robin Scheibler, Kohei Saijo, Yihui Fu, Zhaoheng Ni, Anurag Kumar, Tim Fingscheidt, Shinji Watanabe, Yanmin Qian
Abstract: The Mean Opinion Score (MOS) is fundamental to speech quality assessment. However, its acquisition requires significant human annotation. Although deep neural network approaches, such as DNSMOS and UTMOS, have been developed to predict MOS to avoid this issue, they often suffer from insufficient training data. Recognizing that the comparison of speech enhancement (SE) systems prioritizes a reliable system comparison over absolute scores, we propose URGENT-PK, a novel ranking approach leveraging pairwise comparisons. URGENT-PK takes homologous enhanced speech pairs as input to predict relative quality rankings. This pairwise paradigm efficiently utilizes limited training data, as all pairwise permutations of multiple systems constitute a training instance. Experiments across multiple open test sets demonstrate URGENT-PK's superior system-level ranking performance over state-of-the-art baselines, despite its simple network architecture and limited training data.

Title: Optimized Frequency-Diverse Movable Antenna Arrays for Directional Secrecy in Wireless Systems
Authors: Chu Li, Marjan Boloori, Eduard Jorswieck, Aydin Sezgin
Abstract: Movable-antenna (MA) arrays are envisioned as a promising technique for enhancing secrecy performance in wireless communications by leveraging additional spatial degrees of freedom. However, when the eavesdropper is located in the same direction as the legitimate user, particularly in mmWave/THz bands where line-of-sight (LOS) propagation dominates, the secrecy performance of MA arrays becomes significantly limited, thus directionally insecure. To address this challenge, we employ a joint design that combines an MA array with a frequency-diverse array (FDA) at the transmitter to secure the transmission across both range and direction. Specifically, we derive closed-form expressions for the optimal antenna positions and frequency shifts, assuming small perturbations in both parameters from a linear frequency-diverse MA configuration. Furthermore, we compare the worst-case secrecy rate under this minor perturbation assumption with that obtained under a general constraint, where simulated annealing is employed to numerically determine the optimal parameters. Simulation results confirm that the proposed optimized frequency diverse MA approach significantly enhances secrecy performance in the presence of an eavesdropper aligned with the direction of the legitimate receiver.

Title: Pinching-Antenna Systems with In-Waveguide Attenuation: Performance Analysis and Algorithm Design
Authors: Yanqing Xu, Zhiguo Ding, Robert Schober, Tsung-Hui Chang
Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems have emerged as a promising flexible-antenna architecture for next-generation wireless networks, enabling enhanced adaptability and user-centric connectivity through antenna repositioning along waveguides. However, existing studies often overlook in-waveguide signal attenuation and in the literature, there is no comprehensive analysis on whether and under what conditions such an assumption is justified. This paper addresses this gap by explicitly incorporating in-waveguide attenuation into both the system model and algorithm design, and studying its impact on the downlink user data rates. We begin with a single-user scenario and derive a closed-form expression for the globally optimal antenna placement, which reveals how the attenuation coefficient and the user-to-waveguide distance jointly affect the optimal antenna position. Based on this analytical solution, we further provide a theoretical analysis identifying the system conditions under which the in-waveguide attenuation has an insignificant impact on the user achievable rate. The study is then extended to the multi-user multiple-input multiple-output setting, where two efficient algorithms are developed, based on the weighted minimum mean square error method and the maximum ratio combining method, to jointly optimize beamforming and antenna placement. Simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms and demonstrate that pinching-antenna systems substantially outperform conventional fixed-antenna baselines, underscoring their potential for future flexible wireless communications.

Title: ShapeKit
Authors: Junqi Liu, Dongli He, Wenxuan Li, Ningyu Wang, Alan L. Yuille, Zongwei Zhou
Abstract: In this paper, we present a practical approach to improve anatomical shape accuracy in whole-body medical segmentation. Our analysis shows that a shape-focused toolkit can enhance segmentation performance by over 8%, without the need for model re-training or fine-tuning. In comparison, modifications to model architecture typically lead to marginal gains of less than 3%. Motivated by this observation, we introduce ShapeKit, a flexible and easy-to-integrate toolkit designed to refine anatomical shapes. This work highlights the underappreciated value of shape-based tools and calls attention to their potential impact within the medical segmentation community.

Title: Simultaneous Super-Resolution of Spatial and Spectral Imaging with a Camera Array and Notch Filters
Authors: Peng Lin, Xuesong Wang, Yating Chen, Xianyu Wu, Feng Huang, Shouqian Chen
Abstract: This study proposes an algorithm based on a notch filter camera array system for simultaneous super-resolution imaging and spectral reconstruction, enhancing the spatial resolution and multispectral imaging capabilities of targets. In this study, multi-aperture super-resolution algorithms, pan-sharpening techniques, and spectral reconstruction algorithms were investigated and integrated. The sub-pixel level offset information and spectral disparities among the 9 low-resolution images captured by the 9 distinct imaging apertures were utilized, leading to the successful reconstruction of 31 super-resolution spectral images. By conducting simulations with a publicly available dataset and performing qualitative and quantitative comparisons with snapshot coded aperture spectral imaging systems, the experimental results demonstrate that our system and algorithm attained a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 35.6dB, representing a 5dB enhancement over the most advanced snapshot coded aperture spectral imaging systems, while also reducing processing time. This research offers an effective solution for achieving high temporal, spectral, and spatial resolution through the utilization of multi-aperture imaging systems.

Title: Orchestrated Couplings: A Time-Varying Edge Weight Framework for Efficient Event-Triggered Multiagent Networks
Authors: Emre Yildirim, Tansel Yucelen, Arman Sargolzaei
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on reducing node-to-node information exchange in distributed control of multiagent networks while improving the overall network performance. Specifically, we consider a multiagent network that is composed of leader and follower nodes over a time-varying, connected, and undirected graph. In contrast to existing works on the event-triggered distributed control literature, we propose a time-varying edge weight event-triggered control framework. In this framework, each node dynamically adjusts its edge weights by increasing them during the transient (active) phase and decreasing them during the steady-state (idle) phase of the multiagent network. This not only reduces the number of events in the network but also improves the performance (i.e., convergence speed and control effort) of the overall multiagent network. System-theoretically, we first prove the closed-loop stability of the proposed event-triggered distributed control framework, where we then show that this framework does not exhibit a Zeno behavior. Finally, illustrative numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of this framework.

Title: Post-processing of EEG-based Auditory Attention Decoding Decisions via Hidden Markov Models
Authors: Nicolas Heintz, Tom Francart, Alexander Bertrand
Abstract: Auditory attention decoding (AAD) algorithms exploit brain signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG), to identify which speaker a listener is focusing on in a multi-speaker environment. While state-of-the-art AAD algorithms can identify the attended speaker on short time windows, their predictions are often too inaccurate for practical use. In this work, we propose augmenting AAD with a hidden Markov model (HMM) that models the temporal structure of attention. More specifically, the HMM relies on the fact that a subject is much less likely to switch attention than to keep attending the same speaker at any moment in time. We show how a HMM can significantly improve existing AAD algorithms in both causal (real-time) and non-causal (offline) settings. We further demonstrate that HMMs outperform existing postprocessing approaches in both accuracy and responsiveness, and explore how various factors such as window length, switching frequency, and AAD accuracy influence overall performance. The proposed method is computationally efficient, intuitive to use and applicable in both real-time and offline settings.

Title: C3VDv2 -- Colonoscopy 3D video dataset with enhanced realism
Authors: Mayank V. Golhar, Lucas Sebastian Galeano Fretes, Loren Ayers, Venkata S. Akshintala, Taylor L. Bobrow, Nicholas J. Durr
Abstract: Computer vision techniques have the potential to improve the diagnostic performance of colonoscopy, but the lack of 3D colonoscopy datasets for training and validation hinders their development. This paper introduces C3VDv2, the second version (v2) of the high-definition Colonoscopy 3D Video Dataset, featuring enhanced realism designed to facilitate the quantitative evaluation of 3D colon reconstruction algorithms. 192 video sequences were captured by imaging 60 unique, high-fidelity silicone colon phantom segments. Ground truth depth, surface normals, optical flow, occlusion, six-degree-of-freedom pose, coverage maps, and 3D models are provided for 169 colonoscopy videos. Eight simulated screening colonoscopy videos acquired by a gastroenterologist are provided with ground truth poses. The dataset includes 15 videos featuring colon deformations for qualitative assessment. C3VDv2 emulates diverse and challenging scenarios for 3D reconstruction algorithms, including fecal debris, mucous pools, blood, debris obscuring the colonoscope lens, en-face views, and fast camera motion. The enhanced realism of C3VDv2 will allow for more robust and representative development and evaluation of 3D reconstruction algorithms.

Title: Time Shift Governor-Guided MPC with Collision Cone CBFs for Safe Adaptive Cruise Control in Dynamic Environments
Authors: Robin Inho Kee, Taehyeun Kim, Anouck Girard, Ilya Kolmanovsky
Abstract: This paper introduces a Time Shift Governor (TSG)-guided Model Predictive Controller with Control Barrier Functions (CBFs)-based constraints for adaptive cruise control (ACC). This MPC-CBF approach is defined for obstacle-free curved road tracking, while following distance and obstacle avoidance constraints are handled using standard CBFs and relaxed Collision Cone CBFs. In order to address scenarios involving rapidly moving obstacles or rapidly changing leading vehicle's behavior, the TSG augmentation is employed which alters the target reference to enforce constraints. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the TSG-guided MPC-CBF approach.

Title: Vision Transformers for Multi-Variable Climate Downscaling: Emulating Regional Climate Models with a Shared Encoder and Multi-Decoder Architecture
Authors: Fabio Merizzi, Harilaos Loukos
Abstract: Global Climate Models (GCMs) are critical for simulating large-scale climate dynamics, but their coarse spatial resolution limits their applicability in regional studies. Regional Climate Models (RCMs) refine this through dynamic downscaling, albeit at considerable computational cost and with limited flexibility. While deep learning has emerged as an efficient data-driven alternative, most existing studies have focused on single-variable models that downscale one variable at a time. This approach can lead to limited contextual awareness, redundant computation, and lack of cross-variable interaction. Our study addresses these limitations by proposing a multi-task, multi-variable Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture with a shared encoder and variable-specific decoders (1EMD). The proposed architecture jointly predicts three key climate variables: surface temperature (tas), wind speed (sfcWind), and 500 hPa geopotential height (zg500), directly from GCM-resolution inputs, emulating RCM-scale downscaling over Europe. We show that our multi-variable approach achieves positive cross-variable knowledge transfer and consistently outperforms single-variable baselines trained under identical conditions, while also improving computational efficiency. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-variable modeling for high-resolution climate downscaling.

Title: Reliable Transmission of LTP Using Reinforcement Learning-Based Adaptive FEC
Authors: Liang Chen, Yu Song, Kanglian Zhao, Juan A. Fraire, Wenfeng Li
Abstract: Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) employs the Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) with Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) for reliable data delivery in challenging interplanetary networks. While previous studies have integrated packet-level Forward Erasure Correction (FEC) into LTP to reduce retransmission time costs, existing static and delay-feedback-based dynamic coding methods struggle with highly variable and unpredictable deep space channel conditions. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-based adaptive FEC algorithm to address these limitations. The algorithm utilizes historical feedback and system state to predict future channel conditions and proactively adjust the code rate. This approach aims to anticipate channel quality degradation, thereby preventing decoding failures and subsequent LTP retransmissions and improving coding efficiency by minimizing redundancy during favorable channel conditions. Performance evaluations conducted in simulated Earth-Moon and Earth-Mars link scenarios demonstrate this algorithm's effectiveness in optimizing data transmission for interplanetary networks. Compared to existing methods, this approach demonstrates significant improvement, with matrix decoding failures reduced by at least 2/3.

Title: Unsupervised Discovery of Behavioral Primitives from Sensorimotor Dynamic Functional Connectivity
Authors: Fernando Diaz Ledezma, Valentin Marcel, Matej Hoffmann
Abstract: The movements of both animals and robots give rise to streams of high-dimensional motor and sensory information. Imagine the brain of a newborn or the controller of a baby humanoid robot trying to make sense of unprocessed sensorimotor time series. Here, we present a framework for studying the dynamic functional connectivity between the multimodal sensory signals of a robotic agent to uncover an underlying structure. Using instantaneous mutual information, we capture the time-varying functional connectivity (FC) between proprioceptive, tactile, and visual signals, revealing the sensorimotor relationships. Using an infinite relational model, we identified sensorimotor modules and their evolving connectivity. To further interpret these dynamic interactions, we employed non-negative matrix factorization, which decomposed the connectivity patterns into additive factors and their corresponding temporal coefficients. These factors can be considered the agent's motion primitives or movement synergies that the agent can use to make sense of its sensorimotor space and later for behavior selection. In the future, the method can be deployed in robot learning as well as in the analysis of human movement trajectories or brain signals.

Title: RL-based Adaptive Task Offloading in Mobile-Edge Computing for Future IoT Networks
Authors: Ziad Qais Al Abbasi, Khaled M. Rabie, Senior Member, Xingwang Li, Senior Member, Wali Ullah Khan, Asma Abu Samah
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has been increasingly used in our everyday lives as well as in numerous industrial applications. However, due to limitations in computing and power capabilities, IoT devices need to send their respective tasks to cloud service stations that are usually located at far distances. Having to transmit data far distances introduces challenges for services that require low latency such as industrial control in factories and plants as well as artificial intelligence assisted autonomous driving. To solve this issue, mobile edge computing (MEC) is deployed at the networks edge to reduce transmission time. In this regard, this study proposes a new offloading scheme for MEC-assisted ultra dense cellular networks using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. The proposed scheme enables efficient resource allocation and dynamic offloading decisions based on varying network conditions and user demands. The RL algorithm learns from the networks historical data and adapts the offloading decisions to optimize the networks overall performance. Non-orthogonal multiple access is also adopted to improve resource utilization among the IoT devices. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms other stateof the art offloading algorithms in terms of energy efficiency, network throughput, and user satisfaction.

Title: An Urban Multi-Operator QoE-Aware Dataset for Cellular Networks in Dense Environments
Authors: Muhammad Kabeer, Rosdiadee Nordin, Mehran Behjati, Farah Yasmin binti Mohd Shaharuddin
Abstract: Urban cellular networks face complex performance challenges due to high infrastructure density, varied user mobility, and diverse service demands. While several datasets address network behaviour across different environments, there is a lack of datasets that captures user centric Quality of Experience (QoE), and diverse mobility patterns needed for efficient network planning and optimization solutions, which are important for QoE driven optimizations and mobility management. This study presents a curated dataset of 30,925 labelled records, collected using GNetTrack Pro within a 2 km2 dense urban area, spanning three major commercial network operators. The dataset captures key signal quality parameters (e.g., RSRP, RSRQ, SNR), across multiple real world mobility modes including pedestrian routes, canopy walkways, shuttle buses, and Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) routes. It also includes diverse network traffic scenarios including (1) FTP upload and download, (2) video streaming, and (3) HTTP browsing. A total of 132 physical cell sites were identified and validated through OpenCellID and on-site field inspections, illustrating the high cell density characteristic of 5G and emerging heterogeneous network deployment. The dataset is particularly suited for machine learning applications, such as handover optimization, signal quality prediction, and multi operator performance evaluation. Released in a structured CSV format with accompanying preprocessing and visualization scripts, this dataset offers a reproducible, application ready resource for researchers and practitioners working on urban cellular network planning and optimization.

The application of machine learning to its solution can have a decisive impact, improving both the quality of the resulting stabilization with less computational resources required. In this work, we present a simple pipeline consisting of two neural networks: the oracle predictor and the optimizer, proposing a substitution of the point-wise values optimization to the problem of the neural network training, which successfully improves stability in terms of the temperature control by about 3 times compared to ordinary solvers.

Title: Integrated Multimodal Sensing and Communication: Challenges, Technologies, and Architectures
Authors: Yubo Peng, Luping Xiang, Kun Yang, Feibo Jiang, Kezhi Wang, Christos Masouros
Abstract: The evolution towards 6G networks requires the intelligent integration of communication and sensing capabilities to support diverse and complex applications, such as autonomous driving and immersive services. However, existing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems predominantly rely on single-modal sensors as primary participants, which leads to a limited representation of environmental features and significant performance bottlenecks under the emerging requirements of 6G applications. This limitation motivates a paradigm shift from single-modal to multimodal ISAC. In this article, we first analyze the key challenges in realizing multimodal ISAC, including the fusion of heterogeneous multimodal data, the high communication overhead among distributed sensors, and the design of efficient and scalable system architectures. We then introduce several enabling technologies, such as large AI models, semantic communication, and multi-agent systems, that hold promise for addressing these challenges. To operationalize these technologies, we zoom into three architectural paradigms: fusion-based multimodal ISAC (F-MAC), interaction-based multimodal ISAC (I-MAC), and relay-based multimodal ISAC (R-MAC), each tailored to organize devices and modalities for efficient collaboration in different scenarios. Thereafter, a case study is presented based on the F-MAC scheme, demonstrating that the scheme achieves more comprehensive sensing and improves sensing accuracy by approximately 80% compared to conventional single-modal ISAC systems. Finally, we discuss several open issues to be addressed in the future.

Title: Lightning the Night with Generative Artificial Intelligence
Authors: Tingting Zhou, Feng Zhang, Haoyang Fu, Baoxiang Pan, Renhe Zhang, Feng Lu, Zhixin Yang
Abstract: The visible light reflectance data from geostationary satellites is crucial for meteorological observations and plays an important role in weather monitoring and forecasting. However, due to the lack of visible light at night, it is impossible to conduct continuous all-day weather observations using visible light reflectance data. This study pioneers the use of generative diffusion models to address this limitation. Based on the multi-band thermal infrared brightness temperature data from the Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) onboard the Fengyun-4B (FY4B) geostationary satellite, we developed a high-precision visible light reflectance retrieval model, called Reflectance Diffusion (RefDiff), which enables 0.47~\mu\mathrm{m}, 0.65~\mu\mathrm{m}, and 0.825~\mu\mathrm{m} bands visible light reflectance retrieval at night. Compared to the classical models, RefDiff not only significantly improves accuracy through ensemble averaging but also provides uncertainty estimation. Specifically, the SSIM index of RefDiff can reach 0.90, with particularly significant improvements in areas with complex cloud structures and thick clouds. The model's nighttime retrieval capability was validated using VIIRS nighttime product, demonstrating comparable performance to its daytime counterpart. In summary, this research has made substantial progress in the ability to retrieve visible light reflectance at night, with the potential to expand the application of nighttime visible light data.

Abstract: We present a patch-based image reconstruction and animation method that uses existing image data to bring still images to life through motion. Image patches from curated datasets are grouped using k-means clustering and a new target image is reconstructed by matching and randomly sampling from these clusters. This approach emphasizes reinterpretation over replication, allowing the source and target domains to differ conceptually while sharing local structures.

Title: On beam characterization of ground-based CMB radio telescopes using UAV-mounted sources: application to the QUIJOTE TFGI and plans for LSPE-Strip

Abstract: The Large Scale Polarization Explorer (LSPE) project, funded by the Italian Space Agency (ASI), includes the development of LSPE-Strip, a ground-based radio telescope for observing Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies. LSPE-Strip, nearing its construction phase, will operate from the Teide Observatory in Tenerife, employing 49 coherent polarimeters at 43 GHz to deliver critical data on CMB anisotropies and 6 channels at 95 GHz as atmospheric monitor. On-site characterization of such advanced instruments is crucial to detect possible systematic effects, such as gain fluctuations, beam distortions, and pointing errors, that can compromise performance by introducing spurious polarizations or radiation collection from unintended directions. To address these challenges, a drone-mounted Q-band test source for on-site characterization of LSPE-Strip's polarimeter array was developed. Modern Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer a flexible approach for antenna pattern measurements, yet their use in high-frequency radio astronomy is not consolidated practice. In October 2022, a UAV-based measurement campaign was conducted with the TFGI instrument on the second QUIJOTE telescope in Tenerife, in collaboration with the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias. This pioneering effort aimed to validate UAV-based beam characterization methods and assess QUIJOTE's performance under operational conditions. Preliminary results demonstrated high measurement accuracy, leveraging QUIJOTE's dual-receiver configuration for beam validation. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing UAV systems in preparation for LSPE-Strip's future characterization.

Title: Evaluating Sound Similarity Metrics for Differentiable, Iterative Sound-Matching
Authors: Amir Salimi, Abram Hindle, Osmar R. Zaiane
Abstract: Manual sound design with a synthesizer is inherently iterative: an artist compares the synthesized output to a mental target, adjusts parameters, and repeats until satisfied. Iterative sound-matching automates this workflow by continually programming a synthesizer under the guidance of a loss function (or similarity measure) toward a target sound. Prior comparisons of loss functions have typically favored one metric over another, but only within narrow settings: limited synthesis methods, few loss types, often without blind listening tests. This leaves open the question of whether a universally optimal loss exists, or the choice of loss remains a creative decision conditioned on the synthesis method and the sound designer's preference. We propose differentiable iterative sound-matching as the natural extension of the available literature, since it combines the manual approach to sound design with modern advances in machine learning. To analyze the variability of loss function performance across synthesizers, we implemented a mix of four novel and established differentiable loss functions, and paired them with differentiable subtractive, additive, and AM synthesizers. For each of the sixteen synthesizer--loss combinations, we ran 300 randomized sound-matching trials. Performance was measured using parameter differences, spectrogram-distance metrics, and manually assigned listening scores. We observed a moderate level of consistency among the three performance measures. Our post-hoc analysis shows that the loss function performance is highly dependent on the synthesizer. These findings underscore the value of expanding the scope of sound-matching experiments and developing new similarity metrics tailored to specific synthesis techniques rather than pursuing one-size-fits-all solutions.

Title: Enhancing Neural Audio Fingerprint Robustness to Audio Degradation for Music Identification
Authors: R. O. Araz, G. Cortes-Sebastia, E. Molina, J. Serra, X. Serra, Y. Mitsufuji, D. Bogdanov
Abstract: Audio fingerprinting (AFP) allows the identification of unknown audio content by extracting compact representations, termed audio fingerprints, that are designed to remain robust against common audio degradations. Neural AFP methods often employ metric learning, where representation quality is influenced by the nature of the supervision and the utilized loss function. However, recent work unrealistically simulates real-life audio degradation during training, resulting in sub-optimal supervision. Additionally, although several modern metric learning approaches have been proposed, current neural AFP methods continue to rely on the NT-Xent loss without exploring the recent advances or classical alternatives. In this work, we propose a series of best practices to enhance the self-supervision by leveraging musical signal properties and realistic room acoustics. We then present the first systematic evaluation of various metric learning approaches in the context of AFP, demonstrating that a self-supervised adaptation of the triplet loss yields superior performance. Our results also reveal that training with multiple positive samples per anchor has critically different effects across loss functions. Our approach is built upon these insights and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both a large, synthetically degraded dataset and a real-world dataset recorded using microphones in diverse music venues.

Title: A Mixed-Signal Photonic SRAM-based High-Speed Energy-Efficient Photonic Tensor Core with Novel Electro-Optic ADC
Authors: Md Abdullah-Al Kaiser, Sugeet Sunder, Ajey P. Jacob, Akhilesh R. Jaiswal
Abstract: The rapid surge in data generated by Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) applications demands ultra-fast, scalable, and energy-efficient hardware, as traditional von Neumann architectures face significant latency and power challenges due to data transfer bottlenecks between memory and processing units. Furthermore, conventional electrical memory technologies are increasingly constrained by rising bitline and wordline capacitance, as well as the resistance of compact and long interconnects, as technology scales. In contrast, photonics-based in-memory computing systems offer substantial speed and energy improvements over traditional transistor-based systems, owing to their ultra-fast operating frequencies, low crosstalk, and high data bandwidth. Hence, we present a novel differential photonic SRAM (pSRAM) bitcell-augmented scalable mixed-signal multi-bit photonic tensor core, enabling high-speed, energy-efficient matrix multiplication operations using fabrication-friendly integrated photonic components. Additionally, we propose a novel 1-hot encoding electro-optic analog-to-digital converter (eoADC) architecture to convert the multiplication outputs into digital bitstreams, supporting processing in the electrical domain. Our designed photonic tensor core, utilizing GlobalFoundries' monolithic 45SPCLO technology node, achieves computation speeds of 4.10 tera-operations per second (TOPS) and a power efficiency of 3.02 TOPS/W.

Title: FairMarket-RL: LLM-Guided Fairness Shaping for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Peer-to-Peer Markets
Authors: Shrenik Jadhav, Birva Sevak, Srijita Das, Akhtar Hussain, Wencong Su, Van-Hai Bui
Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) trading is increasingly recognized as a key mechanism for decentralized market regulation, yet existing approaches often lack robust frameworks to ensure fairness. This paper presents FairMarket-RL, a novel hybrid framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enable fairness-aware trading agents. In a simulated P2P microgrid with multiple sellers and buyers, the LLM acts as a real-time fairness critic, evaluating each trading episode using two metrics: Fairness-To-Buyer (FTB) and Fairness-Between-Sellers (FBS). These fairness scores are integrated into agent rewards through scheduled {\lambda}-coefficients, forming an adaptive LLM-guided reward shaping loop that replaces brittle, rule-based fairness constraints. Agents are trained using Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO) and achieve equitable outcomes, fulfilling over 90% of buyer demand, maintaining fair seller margins, and consistently reaching FTB and FBS scores above 0.80. The training process demonstrates that fairness feedback improves convergence, reduces buyer shortfalls, and narrows profit disparities between sellers. With its language-based critic, the framework scales naturally, and its extension to a large power distribution system with household prosumers illustrates its practical applicability. FairMarket-RL thus offers a scalable, equity-driven solution for autonomous trading in decentralized energy systems.

Title: LightBSR: Towards Lightweight Blind Super-Resolution via Discriminative Implicit Degradation Representation Learning
Authors: Jiang Yuan, JI Ma, Bo Wang, Guanzhou Ke, Weiming Hu
Abstract: Implicit degradation estimation-based blind super-resolution (IDE-BSR) hinges on extracting the implicit degradation representation (IDR) of the LR image and adapting it to LR image features to guide HR detail restoration. Although IDE-BSR has shown potential in dealing with noise interference and complex degradations, existing methods ignore the importance of IDR discriminability for BSR and instead over-complicate the adaptation process to improve effect, resulting in a significant increase in the model's parameters and computations. In this paper, we focus on the discriminability optimization of IDR and propose a new powerful and lightweight BSR model termed LightBSR. Specifically, we employ a knowledge distillation-based learning framework. We first introduce a well-designed degradation-prior-constrained contrastive learning technique during teacher stage to make the model more focused on distinguishing different degradation types. Then we utilize a feature alignment technique to transfer the degradation-related knowledge acquired by the teacher to the student for practical inferencing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IDR discriminability-driven BSR model design. The proposed LightBSR can achieve outstanding performance with minimal complexity across a range of blind SR tasks. Our code is accessible at: this https URL.

Title: Robust Tensor Completion via Gradient Tensor Nulclear L1-L2 Norm for Traffic Data Recovery
Authors: Hao Shu, Jicheng Li, Tianyv Lei, Lijun Sun
Abstract: In real-world scenarios, spatiotemporal traffic data frequently experiences dual degradation from missing values and noise caused by sensor malfunctions and communication failures. Therefore, effective data recovery methods are essential to ensure the reliability of downstream data-driven applications. while classical tensor completion methods have been widely adopted, they are incapable of modeling noise, making them unsuitable for complex scenarios involving simultaneous data missingness and noise interference. Existing Robust Tensor Completion (RTC) approaches offer potential solutions by separately modeling the actual tensor data and noise. However, their effectiveness is often constrained by the over-relaxation of convex rank surrogates and the suboptimal utilization of local consistency, leading to inadequate model accuracy. To address these limitations, we first introduce the tensor L1-L2 norm, a novel non-convex tensor rank surrogate that functions as an effective low-rank representation tool. Leveraging an advanced feature fusion strategy, we further develop the gradient tensor L1-L2 norm by incorporating the tensor L1-L2 norm in the gradient domain. By integrating the gradient tensor nuclear L1-L2 norm into the RTC framework, we propose the Robust Tensor Completion via Gradient Tensor Nuclear L1-L2 Norm (RTC-GTNLN) model, which not only fully exploits both global low-rankness and local consistency without trade-off parameter, but also effectively handles the dual degradation challenges of missing data and noise in traffic data. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the RTC-GTNLN model consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in complex recovery scenarios involving simultaneous missing values and noise.

Title: WavShape: Information-Theoretic Speech Representation Learning for Fair and Privacy-Aware Audio Processing
Authors: Oguzhan Baser, Ahmet Ege Tanriverdi, Kaan Kale, Sandeep P. Chinchali, Sriram Vishwanath
Abstract: Speech embeddings often retain sensitive attributes such as speaker identity, accent, or demographic information, posing risks in biased model training and privacy leakage. We propose WavShape, an information-theoretic speech representation learning framework that optimizes embeddings for fairness and privacy while preserving task-relevant information. We leverage mutual information (MI) estimation using the Donsker-Varadhan formulation to guide an MI-based encoder that systematically filters sensitive attributes while maintaining speech content essential for downstream tasks. Experimental results on three known datasets show that WavShape reduces MI between embeddings and sensitive attributes by up to 81% while retaining 97% of task-relevant information. By integrating information theory with self-supervised speech models, this work advances the development of fair, privacy-aware, and resource-efficient speech systems.

Title: A Self-Training Approach for Whisper to Enhance Long Dysarthric Speech Recognition
Authors: Shiyao Wang, Jiaming Zhou, Shiwan Zhao, Yong Qin
Abstract: Dysarthric speech recognition (DSR) enhances the accessibility of smart devices for dysarthric speakers with limited mobility. Previously, DSR research was constrained by the fact that existing datasets typically consisted of isolated words, command phrases, and a limited number of sentences spoken by a few individuals. This constrained research to command-interaction systems and speaker adaptation. The Speech Accessibility Project (SAP) changed this by releasing a large and diverse English dysarthric dataset, leading to the SAP Challenge to build speaker- and text-independent DSR systems. We enhanced the Whisper model's performance on long dysarthric speech via a novel self-training method. This method increased training data and adapted the model to handle potentially incomplete speech segments encountered during inference. Our system achieved second place in both Word Error Rate and Semantic Score in the SAP Challenge.

Title: Terahertz source-on-a-chip with decade-long stability using layered superconductor elliptical microcavities
Authors: Mingqi Zhang, Shungo Nakagawa, Yuki Enomoto, Yoshihiko Kuzumi, Ryuta Kikuchi, Yuki Yamauchi, Toshiaki Hattori, Richard A. Klemm, Kazuo Kadowaki, Takanari Kashiwagi, Kaveh Delfanazari
Abstract: Coherent, continuous-wave, and electrically tunable chip-scale terahertz (THz) sources are critical for emerging applications in sensing, imaging, spectroscopy, communication, space and quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate a robust source-on-a-chip THz emitter based on a layered high-temperature superconductor, engineered with an elliptical microcavity and capable of sustained coherent emission over an unprecedented operational lifetime exceeding 11 years. This compact THz source operates up to 60 K, with Tc= 90 K, delivering stable radiation in the 0.7-0.8 THz range, with on-chip electrical tunability from 100 GHz to 1 THz. Coherence arises from the phase-locked oscillation of intrinsic Josephson junction arrays, resonantly coupled to transverse electromagnetic modes within the cavity, analogous to a laser cavity, yielding collective macroscopic oscillations. THz emission remains detectable across a 0.5 m free-space open-air link at room temperature. We analyse the cavity-mode structure and extract THz photon generation rates up to 503 photons fs-1 in cryogenic conditions and 50-260 photons ps-1 over-the-air. These results establish long-term coherent THz emission from superconductors and chart a viable path toward scalable, tunable, solid-state coherent THz laser-on-a-chip platforms, especially for future classical and quantum systems.

Title: TriADA: Massively Parallel Trilinear Matrix-by-Tensor Multiply-Add Algorithm and Device Architecture for the Acceleration of 3D Discrete Transformations
Authors: Stanislav Sedukhin (1), Yoichi Tomioka (1), Kazuya Matsumoto (1), Yuichi Okuyama (1) ((1) The University of Aizu, Japan)
Abstract: Multilinear transformations are key in high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, where data is represented as tensors. However, their high computational and memory demands, which grow with dimensionality, often slow down critical tasks. Moreover, scaling computation by enlarging the number of parallel processing units substantially increases energy consumption, limiting widespread adoption, especially for sparse data, which is common in HPC and AI applications. This paper introduces the Trilinear Algorithm and isomorphic to algorithm Device Architecture (TriADA) to address these challenges with the following innovations: (1) a massively parallel, low-rank algorithm for computing a family of trilinear (3D) discrete orthogonal transformations (3D-DXTs), which is a special case of the more general 3-mode matrix-by-tensor multiplication (3D-GEMT); (2) a new outer-product-based GEMM kernel with decoupled streaming active memory, specially designed to accelerate 3D-GEMT operation; (3) an isomorphic to the proposed algorithm, fully distributed 3D network of mesh interconnected processing elements or cells with a coordinate-free, data-driven local processing activity, which is independent of problem size; (4) an elastic sparse outer-product (ESOP) method that avoids unnecessary computing and communication operations with zero-valued operands, thereby enhancing energy efficiency, computational accuracy, and stability. TriADA is capable of performing a variety of trilinear transformations with hypercubic arithmetic complexity in a linear number of time-steps. The massively parallel, scalable, and energy-efficient architecture of TriADA is ideal for accelerating multilinear tensor operations, which are the most demanding parts of AI and HPC workloads.

Title: Boosting CTC-Based ASR Using LLM-Based Intermediate Loss Regularization
Authors: Duygu Altinok
Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have revolutionized the field by integrating all components into a single neural network, with attention-based encoder-decoder models achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, their autoregressive decoding process limits inference speed, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. In contrast, CTC-based models offer faster, non-autoregressive decoding but struggle to model linguistic dependencies effectively. Addressing this challenge, we propose a novel auxiliary loss framework called Language-Aware Intermediate Loss (LAIL) to enhance CTC-based ASR using the linguistic knowledge of large language models (LLMs). By attaching connector layers to intermediate encoder layers, LAIL maps outputs to the embedding space of an LLM and computes a causal language modeling loss during training. This approach enhances linguistic modeling while preserving the computational efficiency of CTC decoding. Using the Conformer architecture and various LLaMA models, we demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error Rate (WER) on the LibriSpeech, TEDLIUM2, and WSJ corpora, achieving state-of-the-art performance for CTC-based ASR with minimal computational overhead.

Title: Mind the Gap: Entity-Preserved Context-Aware ASR Structured Transcriptions
Authors: Duygu Altinok
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, such as Whisper, achieve high transcription accuracy but struggle with named entities and numerical data, especially when proper formatting is required. These issues increase word error rate (WER) and impair semantic understanding in critical domains like legal, financial, and medical applications. We propose a novel training approach that extends the semantic context of ASR models by adding overlapping context windows during training. By sliding 5-second overlaps on both sides of 30-second chunks, we create a 40-second "effective semantic window," improving entity recognition and formatting while focusing predictions on the central 30 seconds. To address entities spanning chunk boundaries, we reassign such entities entirely to the right-hand chunk, ensuring proper formatting. Additionally, enriched training data with embedded entity labels enables the model to learn both recognition and type-specific formatting. Evaluated on the Spoken Wikipedia dataset, our method improves performance across semantic tasks, including named entity recognition (NER) and entity formatting. These results highlight the effectiveness of context-aware training in addressing ASR limitations for long-form transcription and complex entity recognition tasks.

Title: Performance Measurements in the AI-Centric Computing Continuum Systems
Authors: Praveen Kumar Donta, Qiyang Zhang, Schahram Dustdar
Abstract: Over the Eight decades, computing paradigms have shifted from large, centralized systems to compact, distributed architectures, leading to the rise of the Distributed Computing Continuum (DCC). In this model, multiple layers such as cloud, edge, Internet of Things (IoT), and mobile platforms work together to support a wide range of applications. Recently, the emergence of Generative AI and large language models has further intensified the demand for computational resources across this continuum. Although traditional performance metrics have provided a solid foundation, they need to be revisited and expanded to keep pace with changing computational demands and application requirements. Accurate performance measurements benefit both system designers and users by supporting improvements in efficiency and promoting alignment with system goals. In this context, we review commonly used metrics in DCC and IoT environments. We also discuss emerging performance dimensions that address evolving computing needs, such as sustainability, energy efficiency, and system observability. We also outline criteria and considerations for selecting appropriate metrics, aiming to inspire future research and development in this critical area.

Title: Neural Cellular Automata: From Cells to Pixels
Authors: Ehsan Pajouheshgar, Yitao Xu, Ali Abbasi, Alexander Mordvintsev, Wenzel Jakob, Sabine Süsstrunk
Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) are bio-inspired systems in which identical cells self-organize to form complex and coherent patterns by repeatedly applying simple local rules. NCAs display striking emergent behaviors including self-regeneration, generalization and robustness to unseen situations, and spontaneous motion. Despite their success in texture synthesis and morphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined to low-resolution grids. This limitation stems from (1) training time and memory requirements that grow quadratically with grid size, (2) the strictly local propagation of information which impedes long-range cell communication, and (3) the heavy compute demands of real-time inference at high resolution. In this work, we overcome this limitation by pairing NCA with a tiny, shared implicit decoder, inspired by recent advances in implicit neural representations. Following NCA evolution on a coarse grid, a lightweight decoder renders output images at arbitrary resolution. We also propose novel loss functions for both morphogenesis and texture synthesis tasks, specifically tailored for high-resolution output with minimal memory and computation overhead. Combining our proposed architecture and loss functions brings substantial improvement in quality, efficiency, and performance. NCAs equipped with our implicit decoder can generate full-HD outputs in real time while preserving their self-organizing, emergent properties. Moreover, because each MLP processes cell states independently, inference remains highly parallelizable and efficient. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach across multiple NCA variants (on 2D, 3D grids, and 3D meshes) and multiple tasks, including texture generation and morphogenesis (growing patterns from a seed), showing that with our proposed framework, NCAs seamlessly scale to high-resolution outputs with minimal computational overhead.

Title: Point Cloud Compression and Objective Quality Assessment: A Survey
Authors: Yiling Xu, Yujie Zhang, Shuting Xia, Kaifa Yang, He Huang, Ziyu Shan, Wenjie Huang, Qi Yang, Le Yang
Abstract: The rapid growth of 3D point cloud data, driven by applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and immersive environments, has led to criticals demand for efficient compression and quality assessment techniques. Unlike traditional 2D media, point clouds present unique challenges due to their irregular structure, high data volume, and complex attributes. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of recent advances in point cloud compression (PCC) and point cloud quality assessment (PCQA), emphasizing their significance for real-time and perceptually relevant applications. We analyze a wide range of handcrafted and learning-based PCC algorithms, along with objective PCQA metrics. By benchmarking representative methods on emerging datasets, we offer detailed comparisons and practical insights into their strengths and limitations. Despite notable progress, challenges such as enhancing visual fidelity, reducing latency, and supporting multimodal data remain. This survey outlines future directions, including hybrid compression frameworks and advanced feature extraction strategies, to enable more efficient, immersive, and intelligent 3D applications.

Title: Energy-Aware Model Predictive Control for Batch Manufacturing System Scheduling Under Different Electricity Pricing Strategies
Authors: Hongliang Li, Herschel C. Pangborn, Ilya Kovalenko
Abstract: Manufacturing industries are among the highest energy-consuming sectors, facing increasing pressure to reduce energy costs. This paper presents an energy-aware Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework to dynamically schedule manufacturing processes in response to time-varying electricity prices without compromising production goals or violating production constraints. A network-based manufacturing system model is developed to capture complex material flows, batch processing, and capacities of buffers and machines. The scheduling problem is formulated as a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP) that balances energy costs, buffer levels, and production requirements. A case study evaluates the proposed MPC framework under four industrial electricity pricing schemes. Numerical results demonstrate that the approach reduces energy usage expenses while satisfying production goals and adhering to production constraints. The findings highlight the importance of considering the detailed electricity cost structure in manufacturing scheduling decisions and provide practical insights for manufacturers when selecting among different electricity pricing strategies.

Title: Mathematical Computation on High-dimensional Data via Array Programming and Parallel Acceleration
Authors: Chen Zhang
Abstract: While deep learning excels in natural image and language processing, its application to high-dimensional data faces computational challenges due to the dimensionality curse. Current large-scale data tools focus on business-oriented descriptive statistics, lacking mathematical statistics support for advanced analysis. We propose a parallel computation architecture based on space completeness, decomposing high-dimensional data into dimension-independent structures for distributed processing. This framework enables seamless integration of data mining and parallel-optimized machine learning methods, supporting scientific computations across diverse data types like medical and natural images within a unified system.

Title: Feasibility of spectral-element modeling of wave propagation through the anatomy of marine mammals
Authors: Carlos García A., Vladimiro Boselli, Aida Hejazi Nooghabi, Andrea Colombi, Lapo Boschi
Abstract: This study introduces the first 3D spectral-element method (SEM) simulation of ultrasonic wave propagation in a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) head. Unlike traditional finite-element methods (FEM), which struggle with high-frequency simulations due to costly linear-system inversions and slower convergence, SEM offers exponential convergence and efficient parallel computation. Using Computed Tomography (CT) scan data, we developed a detailed hexahedral mesh capturing complex anatomical features, such as acoustic fats and jaws. Our simulations of plane and spherical waves confirm SEM's effectiveness for ultrasonic time-domain modeling. This approach opens new avenues for marine biology, contributing to research in echolocation, the impacts of anthropogenic marine noise pollution and the biophysics of hearing and click generation in marine mammals. By overcoming FEM's limitations, SEM provides a powerful scalable tool to test hypotheses about dolphin bioacoustics, with significant implications for conservation and understanding marine mammal auditory systems under increasing environmental challenges.

Title: Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Continuous Variable Terahertz Quantum Key Distribution
Authors: Mingqi Zhang, Kaveh Delfanazari
Abstract: We propose a novel continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) protocol that employs orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) in the terahertz (THz) band to enable high-throughput and secure quantum communication. By encoding quantum information across multiple subcarriers, the protocol enhances spectral efficiency and mitigates channel dispersion and atmospheric attenuation. We present a comprehensive security analysis under collective Gaussian attacks, considering both terrestrial free-space channels, accounting for humidity-induced absorption, and inter-satellite links, incorporating realistic intermodulation noise. Simulations show secret key rates (SKR) reaching ~72 bits per channel use in open-air conditions. While intermodulation noise imposes trade-offs, optimised modulation variance enables resilience and secure communication range. The maximum terrestrial quantum link extends up to 4.5 m due to atmospheric THz absorption, whereas inter-satellite links can support secure communication over distances exceeding 100 km, owing to minimal propagation channel losses in space. We evaluate the practical implementation of our protocol using recently developed on-chip coherent THz sources based on superconducting Josephson junctions. These compact, voltage-tunable emitters produce wideband coherent radiation, making them ideal candidates for integration in scalable quantum networks. By incorporating their characteristics into our simulations, we assess secure key generation under various environmental conditions. Our results show secure communication over distances up to 3 m in open air, and up to 26 km in cryogenic or vacuum environments. This work advances the prospect of compact, high-capacity CVQKD systems for both terrestrial and space-based THz quantum communication.

Title: Resilient-Native and Intelligent Next-Generation Wireless Systems: Key Enablers, Foundations, and Applications
Authors: Mehdi Bennis, Sumudu Samarakoon, Tamara Alshammari, Chathuranga Weeraddana, Zhoujun Tian, Chaouki Ben Issaid
Abstract: Just like power, water, and transportation systems, wireless networks are a crucial societal infrastructure. As natural and human-induced disruptions continue to grow, wireless networks must be resilient. This requires them to withstand and recover from unexpected adverse conditions, shocks, unmodeled disturbances and cascading failures. Unlike robustness and reliability, resilience is based on the understanding that disruptions will inevitably happen. Resilience, as elasticity, focuses on the ability to bounce back to favorable states, while resilience as plasticity involves agents and networks that can flexibly expand their states and hypotheses through real-time adaptation and reconfiguration. This situational awareness and active preparedness, adapting world models and counterfactually reasoning about potential system failures and the best responses, is a core aspect of resilience. This article will first disambiguate resilience from reliability and robustness, before delving into key mathematical foundations of resilience grounded in abstraction, compositionality and emergence. Subsequently, we focus our attention on a plethora of techniques and methodologies pertaining to the unique characteristics of resilience, as well as their applications through a comprehensive set of use cases. Ultimately, the goal of this paper is to establish a unified foundation for understanding, modeling, and engineering resilience in wireless communication systems, while laying a roadmap for the next-generation of resilient-native and intelligent wireless systems.

Title: A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Optimal Control in Microgrids
Authors: Davide Salaorni, Federico Bianchi, Francesco Trovò, Marcello Restelli
Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) is transforming traditional power grid networks, which require new approaches for managing decentralized energy production and consumption. Microgrids (MGs) provide a promising solution by enabling localized control over energy generation, storage, and distribution. This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based methodology for optimizing microgrid energy management. Specifically, we propose an RL agent that learns optimal energy trading and storage policies by leveraging historical data on energy production, consumption, and market prices. A digital twin (DT) is used to simulate the energy storage system dynamics, incorporating degradation factors to ensure a realistic emulation of the analysed setting. Our approach is validated through an experimental campaign using real-world data from a power grid located in the Italian territory. The results indicate that the proposed RL-based strategy outperforms rule-based methods and existing RL benchmarks, offering a robust solution for intelligent microgrid management.

Title: A Novel Frame Identification and Synchronization Technique for Smartphone Visible Light Communication Systems Based on Convolutional Neural Networks
Authors: Vaigai Nayaki Yokar, Hoa Le-Minh, Xicong Li, Wai Lok Woo, Luis Nero Alves, Stanislav Zvanovec, Tran The Son, Zabih Ghassemlooy
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel, robust, and lightweight supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based technique for frame identification and synchronization, designed to enhance short-link communication performance in a screen-to-camera (S2C) based visible light communication (VLC) system. Developed using Python and the TensorFlow Keras framework, the proposed CNN model was trained through three real-time experimental investigations conducted in Jupyter Notebook. These experiments incorporated a dataset created from scratch to address various real-time challenges in S2C communication, including blurring, cropping, and rotated images in mobility scenarios. Overhead frames were introduced for synchronization, which leads to enhanced system performance. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves an overall accuracy of approximately 98.74%, highlighting its effectiveness in identifying and synchronizing frames in S2C VLC systems.

Title: VisionScores -- A system-segmented image score dataset for deep learning tasks
Authors: Alejandro Romero Amezcua, Mariano José Juan Rivera Meraz
Abstract: VisionScores presents a novel proposal being the first system-segmented image score dataset, aiming to offer structure-rich, high information-density images for machine and deep learning tasks. Delimited to two-handed piano pieces, it was built to consider not only certain graphic similarity but also composition patterns, as this creative process is highly instrument-dependent. It provides two scenarios in relation to composer and composition type. The first, formed by 14k samples, considers works from different authors but the same composition type, specifically, Sonatinas. The latter, consisting of 10.8K samples, presents the opposite case, various composition types from the same author, being the one selected Franz Liszt. All of the 24.8k samples are formatted as grayscale jpg images of $128 \times 512$ pixels. VisionScores supplies the users not only the formatted samples but the systems' order and pieces' metadata. Moreover, unsegmented full-page scores and the pre-formatted images are included for further analysis.

Title: Fragile, Robust, and Antifragile: A Perspective from Parameter Responses in Reinforcement Learning Under Stress
Authors: Zain ul Abdeen, Ming Jin
Abstract: This paper explores Reinforcement learning (RL) policy robustness by systematically analyzing network parameters under internal and external stresses. Inspired by synaptic plasticity in neuroscience, synaptic filtering introduces internal stress by selectively perturbing parameters, while adversarial attacks apply external stress through modified agent observations. This dual approach enables the classification of parameters as fragile, robust, or antifragile, based on their influence on policy performance in clean and adversarial settings. Parameter scores are defined to quantify these characteristics, and the framework is validated on PPO-trained agents in Mujoco continuous control environments. The results highlight the presence of antifragile parameters that enhance policy performance under stress, demonstrating the potential of targeted filtering techniques to improve RL policy adaptability. These insights provide a foundation for future advancements in the design of robust and antifragile RL systems.

Title: AURA: Agent for Understanding, Reasoning, and Automated Tool Use in Voice-Driven Tasks
Authors: Leander Melroy Maben, Gayathri Ganesh Lakshmy, Srijith Radhakrishnan, Siddhant Arora, Shinji Watanabe
Abstract: Despite advances in language and speech technologies, no open-source system enables full speech-to-speech, multi-turn dialogue with integrated tool use and agentic reasoning. We introduce AURA (Agent for Understanding, Reasoning, and Automated Tool Use), the first open-source, speech-native assistant capable of completing complex, goal-driven tasks through dynamic tool invocation and multi-turn conversation. AURA combines open-weight ASR, TTS, and LLMs in a cascaded pipeline and supports tools such as calendar booking, contact lookup, web search, and email. Its modular design allows easy integration of new tools using natural language prompts and action classes. On VoiceBench, AURA scores 92.75% on OpenBookQA-outperforming all open-weight systems and nearing GPT-4o-and 4.39 on AlpacaEval, competitive with other open-weight systems. Human evaluation shows 90% task success on complex, multi-turn speech tasks.

Title: Flexible Intelligent Metasurface for Enhancing Multi-Target Wireless Sensing
Authors: Zihao Teng, Jiancheng An, Lu Gan, Naofal Al-Dhahir, Zhu Han
Abstract: Flexible intelligent metasurface (FIM) has emerged as a transformative technology to enhance wireless sensing by dynamically morphing its three-dimensional (3D) surface shape and electromagnetic response. Unlike conventional rigid arrays, an FIM consists of low-cost radiating elements that can independently adjust their positions and radiation characteristics, thereby allowing for real-time optimization of the sensing environment. This paper investigates the impact of FIM on wireless sensing performance. Specifically, we focus on the maximization of the cumulated power of the probing signals at the target locations under the per-antenna power constraint by jointly optimizing the transmit covariance matrix and the surface shape of the transmitting FIM. We propose a block coordinate descend (BCD) algorithm to find a locally optimal solution, by alternatively updating the FIM surface shape and the transmit covariance matrix, while keeping the other one fixed at each step. Furthermore, we analyze the computational complexity and convergence properties of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate that FIM enhances wireless sensing by providing a new design degree-of-freedom to coordinate the correlation between steering vectors at different angles. Numerical results demonstrate that FIM significantly improves wireless sensing performance under the considered multi-target scenario.

Title: CSBrain: A Cross-scale Spatiotemporal Brain Foundation Model for EEG Decoding
Authors: Yuchen Zhou, Jiamin Wu, Zichen Ren, Zhouheng Yao, Weiheng Lu, Kunyu Peng, Qihao Zheng, Chunfeng Song, Wanli Ouyang, Chao Gou
Abstract: Understanding and decoding brain activity from electroencephalography (EEG) signals is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience and AI, with applications in cognition, emotion recognition, diagnosis, and brain-computer interfaces. While recent EEG foundation models advance generalized decoding via unified architectures and large-scale pretraining, they adopt a scale-agnostic dense modeling paradigm inherited from NLP and vision. This design neglects a core property of neural activity: cross-scale spatiotemporal structure. EEG task patterns span a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, from short bursts to slow rhythms, and from localized cortical responses to distributed interactions. Ignoring this diversity leads to suboptimal representations and weak generalization. We propose CSBrain, a Cross-scale Spatiotemporal Brain foundation model for generalized EEG decoding. CSBrain introduces: (i) Cross-scale Spatiotemporal Tokenization (CST), which aggregates multi-scale features from localized temporal windows and anatomical brain regions into compact scale-aware tokens; and (ii) Structured Sparse Attention (SSA), which captures cross-window and cross-region dependencies, enhancing scale diversity while removing spurious correlations. CST and SSA are alternately stacked to progressively integrate multi-scale dependencies. Experiments on 11 EEG tasks across 16 datasets show that CSBrain consistently outperforms task-specific and foundation model baselines. These results establish cross-scale modeling as a key inductive bias and position CSBrain as a robust backbone for future brain-AI research.

Title: TOMI: Transforming and Organizing Music Ideas for Multi-Track Compositions with Full-Song Structure
Authors: Qi He, Gus Xia, Ziyu Wang
Abstract: Hierarchical planning is a powerful approach to model long sequences structurally. Aside from considering hierarchies in the temporal structure of music, this paper explores an even more important aspect: concept hierarchy, which involves generating music ideas, transforming them, and ultimately organizing them--across musical time and space--into a complete composition. To this end, we introduce TOMI (Transforming and Organizing Music Ideas) as a novel approach in deep music generation and develop a TOMI-based model via instruction-tuned foundation LLM. Formally, we represent a multi-track composition process via a sparse, four-dimensional space characterized by clips (short audio or MIDI segments), sections (temporal positions), tracks (instrument layers), and transformations (elaboration methods). Our model is capable of generating multi-track electronic music with full-song structure, and we further integrate the TOMI-based model with the REAPER digital audio workstation, enabling interactive human-AI co-creation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach produces higher-quality electronic music with stronger structural coherence compared to baselines.

Title: The Florence Price Art Song Dataset and Piano Accompaniment Generator
Authors: Tao-Tao He, Martin E. Malandro, Douglas Shadle
Abstract: Florence B. Price was a composer in the early 20th century whose music reflects her upbringing in the American South, her African heritage, and her Western classical training. She is noted as the first African-American woman to have a symphony performed by a major orchestra. Her music has recently received renewed attention from both the public and the research community, decades after her death. In addition to other genres, Price was a prolific composer for solo voice and piano. Music historians have documented the existence of 134 art songs and piano/voice arrangements for spirituals and folk songs written by Price. We release a digital catalog of 112 of these works in MuseScore, MusicXML, MIDI, and PDF format. We also use this dataset to fine-tune a symbolic music generation model to generate accompaniments to melodies, and we conduct a blind listening experiment that shows that accompaniments generated by our model are perceived as being reflective of Florence Price's style more frequently than accompaniments generated by a baseline model. We release our model as the Florence Price Piano Accompaniment Generator alongside our dataset.

Title: External Data-Enhanced Meta-Representation for Adaptive Probabilistic Load Forecasting
Authors: Haoran Li, Muhao Guo, Marija Ilic, Yang Weng, Guangchun Ruan
Abstract: Accurate residential load forecasting is critical for power system reliability with rising renewable integration and demand-side flexibility. However, most statistical and machine learning models treat external factors, such as weather, calendar effects, and pricing, as extra input, ignoring their heterogeneity, and thus limiting the extraction of useful external information. We propose a paradigm shift: external data should serve as meta-knowledge to dynamically adapt the forecasting model itself. Based on this idea, we design a meta-representation framework using hypernetworks that modulate selected parameters of a base Deep Learning (DL) model in response to external conditions. This provides both expressivity and adaptability. We further integrate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism to enhance efficiency through selective expert activation, while improving robustness by filtering redundant external inputs. The resulting model, dubbed as a Meta Mixture of Experts for External data (M2oE2), achieves substantial improvements in accuracy and robustness with limited additional overhead, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in diverse load datasets. The dataset and source code are publicly available at this https URL\_load\this http URL.

Title: Nuisance parameters and elliptically symmetric distributions: a geometric approach to parametric and semiparametric efficiency
Authors: Stefano Fortunati, Jean-Pierre Delmas, Esa Ollila
Abstract: Elliptically symmetric distributions are a classic example of a semiparametric model where the location vector and the scatter matrix (or a parameterization of them) are the two finite-dimensional parameters of interest, while the density generator represents an \textit{infinite-dimensional nuisance} term. This basic representation of the elliptic model can be made more accurate, rich, and flexible by considering additional \textit{finite-dimensional nuisance} parameters. Our aim is therefore to investigate the deep and counter-intuitive links between statistical efficiency in estimating the parameters of interest in the presence of both finite and infinite-dimensional nuisance parameters. Unlike previous works that addressed this problem using Le Cam's asymptotic theory, our approach here is purely geometric: efficiency will be analyzed using tools such as projections and tangent spaces embedded in the relevant Hilbert space. This allows us to obtain original results also for the case where the location vector and the scatter matrix are parameterized by a finite-dimensional vector that can be partitioned in two sub-vectors: one containing the parameters of interest and the other containing the nuisance parameters. As an example, we illustrate how the obtained results can be applied to the well-known \virg{low-rank} parameterization. Furthermore, while the theoretical analysis will be developed for Real Elliptically Symmetric (RES) distributions, we show how to extend our results to the case of Circular and Non-Circular Complex Elliptically Symmetric (C-CES and NC-CES) distributions.

Title: PixelBoost: Leveraging Brownian Motion for Realistic-Image Super-Resolution
Authors: Aradhana Mishra, Bumshik Lee
Abstract: Diffusion-model-based image super-resolution techniques often face a trade-off between realistic image generation and computational efficiency. This issue is exacerbated when inference times by decreasing sampling steps, resulting in less realistic and hazy images. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel diffusion model named PixelBoost that underscores the significance of embracing the stochastic nature of Brownian motion in advancing image super-resolution, resulting in a high degree of realism, particularly focusing on texture and edge definitions. By integrating controlled stochasticity into the training regimen, our proposed model avoids convergence to local optima, effectively capturing and reproducing the inherent uncertainty of image textures and patterns. Our proposed model demonstrates superior objective results in terms of learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), lightness order error (LOE), peak signal-to-noise ratio(PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), as well as visual quality. To determine the edge enhancement, we evaluated the gradient magnitude and pixel value, and our proposed model exhibited a better edge reconstruction capability. Additionally, our model demonstrates adaptive learning capabilities by effectively adjusting to Brownian noise patterns and introduces a sigmoidal noise sequencing method that simplifies training, resulting in faster inference speeds.

Title: Parallax QAMA: Novel Downlink Multiple Access for MISO Systems with Simple Receivers
Authors: Jie Huang, Ming Zhao, Shengli Zhou, Ling Qiu, Jinkang Zhu
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel downlink multiple access system with a multi-antenna transmitter and two single-antenna receivers, inspired by the underlying principles of hierarchical quadrature amplitude modulation (H-QAM) based multiple access (QAMA) and space-division multiple access (SDMA). In the proposed scheme, coded bits from two users are split and assigned to one shared symbol and two private symbols carried by different beams. Based on joint symbol mapping of H-QAM constellations and phase-aligned precoding at the transmitter, each receiver observes a different H-QAM constellation with Gray mapping, a unique parallax feature not shared by existing schemes. In addition to avoiding successive interference cancellation (SIC), each user independently demodulates its own bits on separate I and Q branches with calculations based on closed-form expressions. Hence the receiver complexity is on par with that of orthogonal multiple access (OMA), which is much lower than that in other competing alternatives such as non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). We carry out system optimization and determine the achievable rate region. Numerical results show that the proposed system has a larger rate region relative to other benchmark schemes with receivers not using SIC, and even achieves a comparable rate region to those benchmark schemes with SIC receivers.

Title: XY-Tokenizer: Mitigating the Semantic-Acoustic Conflict in Low-Bitrate Speech Codecs
Authors: Yitian Gong, Luozhijie Jin, Ruifan Deng, Dong Zhang, Xin Zhang, Qinyuan Cheng, Zhaoye Fei, Shimin Li, Xipeng Qiu
Abstract: Speech codecs serve as bridges between speech signals and large language models. An ideal codec for speech language models should not only preserve acoustic information but also capture rich semantic information. However, existing speech codecs struggle to balance high-quality audio reconstruction with ease of modeling by language models. In this study, we analyze the limitations of previous codecs in balancing semantic richness and acoustic fidelity. We propose XY-Tokenizer, a novel codec that mitigates the conflict between semantic and acoustic capabilities through multi-stage, multi-task learning. Experimental results demonstrate that XY-Tokenizer achieves performance in both semantic and acoustic tasks comparable to that of state-of-the-art codecs operating at similar bitrates, even though those existing codecs typically excel in only one aspect. Specifically, XY-Tokenizer achieves strong text alignment, surpassing distillation-based semantic modeling methods such as SpeechTokenizer and Mimi, while maintaining a speaker similarity score of 0.83 between reconstructed and original audio. The reconstruction performance of XY-Tokenizer is comparable to that of BigCodec, the current state-of-the-art among acoustic-only codecs, which achieves a speaker similarity score of 0.84 at a similar bitrate.

Title: Safe and Performant Deployment of Autonomous Systems via Model Predictive Control and Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Analysis
Authors: Hao Wang, Armand Jordana, Ludovic Righetti, Somil Bansal
Abstract: While we have made significant algorithmic developments to enable autonomous systems to perform sophisticated tasks, it remains difficult for them to perform tasks effective and safely. Most existing approaches either fail to provide any safety assurances or substantially compromise task performance for safety. In this work, we develop a framework, based on model predictive control (MPC) and Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability, to optimize task performance for autonomous systems while respecting the safety constraints. Our framework guarantees recursive feasibility for the MPC controller, and it is scalable to high-dimensional systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework with two simulation studies using a 4D Dubins Car and a 6 Dof Kuka iiwa manipulator, and the experiments show that our framework significantly improves the safety constraints satisfaction of the systems over the baselines.

Title: Layer Decomposition and Morphological Reconstruction for Task-Oriented Infrared Image Enhancement
Authors: Siyuan Chai, Xiaodong Guo, Tong Liu
Abstract: Infrared image helps improve the perception capabilities of autonomous driving in complex weather conditions such as fog, rain, and low light. However, infrared image often suffers from low contrast, especially in non-heat-emitting targets like bicycles, which significantly affects the performance of downstream high-level vision tasks. Furthermore, achieving contrast enhancement without amplifying noise and losing important information remains a challenge. To address these challenges, we propose a task-oriented infrared image enhancement method. Our approach consists of two key components: layer decomposition and saliency information extraction. First, we design an layer decomposition method for infrared images, which enhances scene details while preserving dark region features, providing more features for subsequent saliency information extraction. Then, we propose a morphological reconstruction-based saliency extraction method that effectively extracts and enhances target information without amplifying noise. Our method improves the image quality for object detection and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Authors: Paige Tuttösí, H. Henny Yeung, Yue Wang, Jean-Julien Aucouturier, Angelica Lim
Abstract: We present the first text-to-speech (TTS) system tailored to second language (L2) speakers. We use duration differences between American English tense (longer) and lax (shorter) vowels to create a "clarity mode" for Matcha-TTS. Our perception studies showed that French-L1, English-L2 listeners had fewer (at least 9.15%) transcription errors when using our clarity mode, and found it more encouraging and respectful than overall slowed down speech. Remarkably, listeners were not aware of these effects: despite the decreased word error rate in clarity mode, listeners still believed that slowing all target words was the most intelligible, suggesting that actual intelligibility does not correlate with perceived intelligibility. Additionally, we found that Whisper-ASR did not use the same cues as L2 speakers to differentiate difficult vowels and is not sufficient to assess the intelligibility of TTS systems for these individuals.

Title: A Model Predictive Control Framework to Enhance Safety and Quality in Mobile Additive Manufacturing Systems
Authors: Yifei Li, Joshua A. Robbins, Guha Manogharan, Herschel C. Pangborn, Ilya Kovalenko
Abstract: In recent years, the demand for customized, on-demand production has grown in the manufacturing sector. Additive Manufacturing (AM) has emerged as a promising technology to enhance customization capabilities, enabling greater flexibility, reduced lead times, and more efficient material usage. However, traditional AM systems remain constrained by static setups and human worker dependencies, resulting in long lead times and limited scalability. Mobile robots can improve the flexibility of production systems by transporting products to designated locations in a dynamic environment. By integrating AM systems with mobile robots, manufacturers can optimize travel time for preparatory tasks and distributed printing operations. Mobile AM robots have been deployed for on-site production of large-scale structures, but often neglect critical print quality metrics like surface roughness. Additionally, these systems do not have the precision necessary for producing small, intricate components. We propose a model predictive control framework for a mobile AM platform that ensures safe navigation on the plant floor while maintaining high print quality in a dynamic environment. Three case studies are used to test the feasibility and reliability of the proposed systems.

Title: From Large-scale Audio Tagging to Real-Time Explainable Emergency Vehicle Sirens Detection
Authors: Stefano Giacomelli, Marco Giordano, Claudia Rinaldi, Fabio Graziosi
Abstract: Accurate recognition of Emergency Vehicle (EV) sirens is critical for the integration of intelligent transportation systems, smart city monitoring systems, and autonomous driving technologies. Modern automatic solutions are limited by the lack of large scale, curated datasets and by the computational demands of state of the art sound event detection models. This work introduces E2PANNs (Efficient Emergency Pre trained Audio Neural Networks), a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network architecture derived from the PANNs framework, specifically optimized for binary EV siren detection. Leveraging our dedicated subset of AudioSet (AudioSet EV) we fine-tune and evaluate E2PANNs across multiple reference datasets and test its viability on embedded hardware. The experimental campaign includes ablation studies, cross-domain benchmarking, and real-time inference deployment on edge device. Interpretability analyses exploiting Guided Backpropagation and ScoreCAM algorithms provide insights into the model internal representations and validate its ability to capture distinct spectrotemporal patterns associated with different types of EV sirens. Real time performance is assessed through frame wise and event based detection metrics, as well as a detailed analysis of false positive activations. Results demonstrate that E2PANNs establish a new state of the art in this research domain, with high computational efficiency, and suitability for edge-based audio monitoring and safety-critical applications.

Title: Evaluation of Geolocation Capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models and Analysis of Associated Privacy Risks
Authors: Xian Zhang, Xiang Cheng
Abstract: Objectives: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities, enabling a wide range of intelligent applications. However, these advancements also raise critical concerns regarding privacy and ethics. MLLMs are now capable of inferring the geographic location of images -- such as those shared on social media or captured from street views -- based solely on visual content, thereby posing serious risks of privacy invasion, including doxxing, surveillance, and other security threats. Methods: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of existing geolocation techniques based on MLLMs. It systematically reviews relevant litera-ture and evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art visual reasoning models on geolocation tasks, particularly in identifying the origins of street view imagery. Results: Empirical evaluation reveals that the most advanced visual large models can successfully localize the origin of street-level imagery with up to $49\%$ accuracy within a 1-kilometer radius. This performance underscores the models' powerful capacity to extract and utilize fine-grained geographic cues from visual data. Conclusions: Building on these findings, the study identifies key visual elements that contribute to suc-cessful geolocation, such as text, architectural styles, and environmental features. Furthermore, it discusses the potential privacy implications associated with MLLM-enabled geolocation and discuss several technical and policy-based coun-termeasures to mitigate associated risks.

Title: TAG-WM: Tamper-Aware Generative Image Watermarking via Diffusion Inversion Sensitivity
Authors: Yuzhuo Chen, Zehua Ma, Han Fang, Weiming Zhang, Nenghai Yu
Abstract: AI-generated content (AIGC) enables efficient visual creation but raises copyright and authenticity risks. As a common technique for integrity verification and source tracing, digital image watermarking is regarded as a potential solution to above issues. Among these, watermarking methods capable of preserving the generation quality are receiving increased attention. However, the proliferation and high performance of generative image editing applications have elevated the risks of malicious tampering, creating new demands. 1) The tamper robustness of current lossless visual quality watermarks remains constrained by the modification-sensitive diffusion inversion process, necessitating enhanced robustness. 2) The improved tampering quality and rapid iteration cycles render passive tampering detection methods inadequate, making proactive tampering localization capability a desired feature for watermarks. To address these requirements, this paper proposes a Tamper-Aware Generative image WaterMarking method named TAG-WM. The proposed method comprises four key modules: a dual-mark joint sampling (DMJS) algorithm for embedding copyright and localization watermarks into the latent space while preserving generative quality, the watermark latent reconstruction (WLR) utilizing reversed DMJS, a dense variation region detector (DVRD) leveraging diffusion inversion sensitivity to identify tampered areas via statistical deviation analysis, and the tamper-aware decoding (TAD) guided by localization results. The experimental results indicate that TAG-WM achieves SOTA tampering robustness and tampering localization capability with distortions while maintaining lossless generation quality and a considerable capacity of 256 bits.

Title: Securing the Sky: Integrated Satellite-UAV Physical Layer Security for Low-Altitude Wireless Networks
Authors: Jiahui Li, Geng Sun, Xiaoyu Sun, Fang Mei, Jingjing Wang, Xiangwang Hou, Daxin Tian, Victor C. M. Leung
Abstract: Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) have garnered significant attention in the forthcoming 6G networks. In LAWNs, satellites with wide coverage and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with flexible mobility can complement each other to form integrated satellite-UAV networks, providing ubiquitous and high-speed connectivity for low-altitude operations. However, the higher line-of-sight probability in low-altitude airspace increases transmission security concerns. In this work, we present a collaborative beamforming-based physical layer security scheme for LAWNs. We introduce the fundamental aspects of integrated satellite-UAV networks, physical layer security, UAV swarms, and collaborative beamforming for LAWN applications. Following this, we highlight several opportunities for collaborative UAV swarm secure applications enabled by satellite networks, including achieving physical layer security in scenarios involving data dissemination, data relay, eavesdropper collusion, and imperfect eavesdropper information. Next, we detail two case studies: a secure relay system and a two-way aerial secure communication framework specifically designed for LAWN environments. Simulation results demonstrate that these physical layer security schemes are effective and beneficial for secure low-altitude wireless communications. A short practicality analysis shows that the proposed method is applicable to LAWN scenarios. Finally, we discuss current challenges and future research directions for enhancing security in LAWNs.

Title: JAM-Flow: Joint Audio-Motion Synthesis with Flow Matching
Authors: Mingi Kwon, Joonghyuk Shin, Jaeseok Jung, Jaesik Park, Youngjung Uh
Abstract: The intrinsic link between facial motion and speech is often overlooked in generative modeling, where talking head synthesis and text-to-speech (TTS) are typically addressed as separate tasks. This paper introduces JAM-Flow, a unified framework to simultaneously synthesize and condition on both facial motion and speech. Our approach leverages flow matching and a novel Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) architecture, integrating specialized Motion-DiT and Audio-DiT modules. These are coupled via selective joint attention layers and incorporate key architectural choices, such as temporally aligned positional embeddings and localized joint attention masking, to enable effective cross-modal interaction while preserving modality-specific strengths. Trained with an inpainting-style objective, JAM-Flow supports a wide array of conditioning inputs-including text, reference audio, and reference motion-facilitating tasks such as synchronized talking head generation from text, audio-driven animation, and much more, within a single, coherent model. JAM-Flow significantly advances multi-modal generative modeling by providing a practical solution for holistic audio-visual synthesis. project page: this https URL

Title: Tensor Train Quantum State Tomography using Compressed Sensing
Authors: Shakir Showkat Sofi, Charlotte Vermeylen, Lieven De Lathauwer
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is a fundamental technique for estimating the state of a quantum system from measured data and plays a crucial role in evaluating the performance of quantum devices. However, standard estimation methods become impractical due to the exponential growth of parameters in the state representation. In this work, we address this challenge by parameterizing the state using a low-rank block tensor train decomposition and demonstrate that our approach is both memory- and computationally efficient. This framework applies to a broad class of quantum states that can be well approximated by low-rank decompositions, including pure states, nearly pure states, and ground states of Hamiltonians.

Title: Alleviating CoD in Renewable Energy Profile Clustering Using an Optical Quantum Computer
Authors: Chengjun Liu, Yijun Xu, Wei Gu, Bo Sun, Kai Wen, Shuai Lu, Lamine Mili
Abstract: The traditional clustering problem of renewable energy profiles is typically formulated as a combinatorial optimization that suffers from the Curse of Dimensionality (CoD) on classical computers. To address this issue, this paper first proposed a kernel-based quantum clustering method. More specifically, the kernel-based similarity between profiles with minimal intra-group distance is encoded into the ground-state of the Hamiltonian in the form of an Ising model. Then, this NP-hard problem can be reformulated into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO), which a Coherent Ising Machine (CIM) can naturally solve with significant improvement over classical computers. The test results from a real optical quantum computer verify the validity of the proposed method. It also demonstrates its ability to address CoD in an NP-hard clustering problem.

Title: RELATE: Subjective evaluation dataset for automatic evaluation of relevance between text and audio
Authors: Yusuke Kanamori, Yuki Okamoto, Taisei Takano, Shinnosuke Takamichi, Yuki Saito, Hiroshi Saruwatari
Abstract: In text-to-audio (TTA) research, the relevance between input text and output audio is an important evaluation aspect. Traditionally, it has been evaluated from both subjective and objective perspectives. However, subjective evaluation is costly in terms of money and time, and objective evaluation is unclear regarding the correlation to subjective evaluation scores. In this study, we construct RELATE, an open-sourced dataset that subjectively evaluates the relevance. Also, we benchmark a model for automatically predicting the subjective evaluation score from synthesized audio. Our model outperforms a conventional CLAPScore model, and that trend extends to many sound categories.

Title: Towards Universal Shared Control in Teleoperation Without Haptic Feedback
Authors: Max Grobbel, Tristan Schneider, Sören Hohmann
Abstract: Teleoperation with non-haptic VR controllers deprives human operators of critical motion feedback. We address this by embedding a multi-objective optimization problem that converts user input into collision-free UR5e joint trajectories while actively suppressing liquid slosh in a glass. The controller maintains 13 ms average planning latency, confirming real-time performance and motivating the augmentation of this teleoperation approach to further objectives.

Title: Efficient Interleaved Speech Modeling through Knowledge Distillation
Authors: Mohammadmahdi Nouriborji, Morteza Rohanian
Abstract: Current speech language models exceed the size and latency constraints of many deployment environments. We build compact, expressive speech generation models through layer-aligned distillation, matching hidden states, attention maps, and softened logits to compress large multimodal transformers by 3x with minimal loss in performance. We introduce TinyWave, a family of 2B-parameter models for speech-to-speech and interleaved speech-text generation, trained on 50,000 hours of public audio. TinyWave supports (i) speech-only generation using phonetic or expressive tokens and (ii) mixed speech-text continuations. Evaluation on Libri-Light shows TinyWave within 1.4 normalized perplexity points of its teacher. Accuracy on spoken StoryCloze and SALMon reaches 93-97% of the teacher's performance, outperforming size-matched baselines. These models are optimized for deployment on commodity hardware, enabling applications in real-time conversational agents, assistive technologies, and low-resource environments. We release models, training code, and evaluation scripts to support reproducible research on compact, expressive speech generation.

Title: How Long Can I Transmit? A Mobility Aware mmWave-based UAV Communication Framework
Authors: Shawon Mitra, Subhojit Sarkar, Sasthi C. Ghosh
Abstract: One primary focus of next generation wireless communication networks is the millimeterwave (mmWave) spectrum, typically considered in the 30 GHz to 300 GHz frequency range. Despite their promise of high data rates, mmWaves suffer from severe attenuation while passing through obstacles. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been proposed to offset this limitation on account of their additional degrees of freedom, which can be leveraged to provide line of sight (LoS) transmission paths. While some prior works have proposed analytical frameworks to compute the LoS probability for static ground users and a UAV, the same is lacking for mobile users on the ground. In this paper, we consider the popular Manhattan point line process (MPLP) to model an urban environment, within which a ground user moves with a known velocity for a small time interval along the roads. We derive an expression for the expected duration of LoS between a static UAV in the air and a mobile ground user, and validate the same through simulations. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed analysis, we propose a simple user association algorithm that greedily assigns the UAVs to users with the highest expected LoS time, and show that it outperforms the existing benchmark schemes that assign the users to the nearest UAVs with LoS without considering the user mobility.

Title: Data-Driven Predictive Planning and Control for Aerial 3D Inspection with Back-face Elimination
Authors: Savvas Papaioannou, Panayiotis Kolios, Christos G. Panayiotou, Marios M. Polycarpou
Abstract: Automated inspection with Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) is a transformative capability set to revolutionize various application domains. However, this task is inherently complex, as it demands the seamless integration of perception, planning, and control which existing approaches often treat separately. Moreover, it requires accurate long-horizon planning to predict action sequences, in contrast to many current techniques, which tend to be myopic. To overcome these limitations, we propose a 3D inspection approach that unifies perception, planning, and control within a single data-driven predictive control framework. Unlike traditional methods that rely on known UAS dynamic models, our approach requires only input-output data, making it easily applicable to off-the-shelf black-box UASs. Our method incorporates back-face elimination, a visibility determination technique from 3D computer graphics, directly into the control loop, thereby enabling the online generation of accurate, long-horizon 3D inspection trajectories.

Title: Scaling Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Symbolic Piano Performance
Authors: Louis Bradshaw, Honglu Fan, Alexander Spangher, Stella Biderman, Simon Colton
Abstract: We study the capabilities of generative autoregressive transformer models trained on large amounts of symbolic solo-piano transcriptions. After first pretraining on approximately 60,000 hours of music, we use a comparatively smaller, high-quality subset, to finetune models to produce musical continuations, perform symbolic classification tasks, and produce general-purpose contrastive MIDI embeddings by adapting the SimCLR framework to symbolic music. When evaluating piano continuation coherence, our generative model outperforms leading symbolic generation techniques and remains competitive with proprietary audio generation models. On MIR classification benchmarks, frozen representations from our contrastive model achieve state-of-the-art results in linear probe experiments, while direct finetuning demonstrates the generalizability of pretrained representations, often requiring only a few hundred labeled examples to specialize to downstream tasks.

Title: Emergent musical properties of a transformer under contrastive self-supervised learning
Authors: Yuexuan Kong, Gabriel Meseguer-Brocal, Vincent Lostanlen, Mathieu Lagrange, Romain Hennequin
Abstract: In music information retrieval (MIR), contrastive self-supervised learning for general-purpose representation models is effective for global tasks such as automatic tagging. However, for local tasks such as chord estimation, it is widely assumed that contrastively trained general-purpose self-supervised models are inadequate and that more sophisticated SSL is necessary; e.g., masked modeling. Our paper challenges this assumption by revealing the potential of contrastive SSL paired with a transformer in local MIR tasks. We consider a lightweight vision transformer with one-dimensional patches in the time--frequency domain (ViT-1D) and train it with simple contrastive SSL through normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy loss (NT-Xent). Although NT-Xent operates only over the class token, we observe that, potentially thanks to weight sharing, informative musical properties emerge in ViT-1D's sequence tokens. On global tasks, the temporal average of class and sequence tokens offers a performance increase compared to the class token alone, showing useful properties in the sequence tokens. On local tasks, sequence tokens perform unexpectedly well, despite not being specifically trained for. Furthermore, high-level musical features such as onsets emerge from layer-wise attention maps and self-similarity matrices show different layers capture different musical dimensions. Our paper does not focus on improving performance but advances the musical interpretation of transformers and sheds light on some overlooked abilities of contrastive SSL paired with transformers for sequence modeling in MIR.

Title: Dimension and model reduction approaches for linear Bayesian inverse problems with rank-deficient prior covariances
Authors: Josie König, Elizabeth Qian, Melina A. Freitag
Abstract: Bayesian inverse problems use observed data to update a prior probability distribution for an unknown state or parameter of a scientific system to a posterior distribution conditioned on the data. In many applications, the unknown parameter is high-dimensional, making computation of the posterior expensive due to the need to sample in a high-dimensional space and the need to evaluate an expensive high-dimensional forward model relating the unknown parameter to the data. However, inverse problems often exhibit low-dimensional structure due to the fact that the available data are only informative in a low-dimensional subspace of the parameter space. Dimension reduction approaches exploit this structure by restricting inference to the low-dimensional subspace informed by the data, which can be sampled more efficiently. Further computational cost reductions can be achieved by replacing expensive high-dimensional forward models with cheaper lower-dimensional reduced models. In this work, we propose new dimension and model reduction approaches for linear Bayesian inverse problems with rank-deficient prior covariances, which arise in many practical inference settings. The dimension reduction approach is applicable to general linear Bayesian inverse problems whereas the model reduction approaches are specific to the problem of inferring the initial condition of a linear dynamical system. We provide theoretical approximation guarantees as well as numerical experiments demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approaches.

Title: StreamFlow: Streaming Flow Matching with Block-wise Guided Attention Mask for Speech Token Decoding
Authors: Dake Guo, Jixun Yao, Linhan Ma, Wang He, Lei Xie
Abstract: Recent advancements in discrete token-based speech generation have highlighted the importance of token-to-waveform generation for audio quality, particularly in real-time interactions. Traditional frameworks integrating semantic tokens with flow matching (FM) struggle with streaming capabilities due to their reliance on a global receptive field. Additionally, directly implementing token-by-token streaming speech generation often results in degraded audio quality. To address these challenges, we propose StreamFlow, a novel neural architecture that facilitates streaming flow matching with diffusion transformers (DiT). To mitigate the long-sequence extrapolation issues arising from lengthy historical dependencies, we design a local block-wise receptive field strategy. Specifically, the sequence is first segmented into blocks, and we introduce block-wise attention masks that enable the current block to receive information from the previous or subsequent block. These attention masks are combined hierarchically across different DiT-blocks to regulate the receptive field of DiTs. Both subjective and objective experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to non-streaming methods while surpassing other streaming methods in terms of speech quality, all the while effectively managing inference time during long-sequence generation. Furthermore, our method achieves a notable first-packet latency of only 180 ms.\footnote{Speech samples: this https URL}

Title: WaRA: Wavelet Low Rank Adaptation
Authors: Moein Heidari, Yasamin Medghalchi, Mahdi Khoursha, Reza Rezaeian, Ilker Hacihaliloglu
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has gained widespread adoption across various applications. Among PEFT techniques, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its extensions have emerged as particularly effective, allowing efficient model adaptation while significantly reducing computational overhead. However, existing approaches typically rely on global low-rank factorizations, which overlook local or multi-scale structure, failing to capture complex patterns in the weight updates. To address this, we propose WaRA, a novel PEFT method that leverages wavelet transforms to decompose the weight update matrix into a multi-resolution representation. By performing low-rank factorization in the wavelet domain and reconstructing updates through an inverse transform, WaRA obtains compressed adaptation parameters that harness multi-resolution analysis, enabling it to capture both coarse and fine-grained features while providing greater flexibility and sparser representations than standard LoRA. Through comprehensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that WaRA performs superior on diverse vision tasks, including image generation, classification, and semantic segmentation, significantly enhancing generated image quality while reducing computational complexity. Although WaRA was primarily designed for vision tasks, we further showcase its effectiveness in language tasks, highlighting its broader applicability and generalizability. The code is publicly available at \href{GitHub}{this https URL}.

Title: Suboptimality analysis of receding horizon quadratic control with unknown linear systems and its applications in learning-based control
Authors: Shengling Shi, Anastasios Tsiamis, Bart De Schutter
Abstract: This work analyzes how the trade-off between the modeling error, the terminal value function error, and the prediction horizon affects the performance of a nominal receding-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) controller. By developing a novel perturbation result of the Riccati difference equation, a novel performance upper bound is obtained and suggests that for many cases, the prediction horizon can be either one or infinity to improve the control performance, depending on the relative difference between the modeling error and the terminal value function error. The result also shows that when an infinite horizon is desired, a finite prediction horizon that is larger than the controllability index can be sufficient for achieving a near-optimal performance, revealing a close relation between the prediction horizon and controllability. The obtained suboptimality performance upper bound is applied to provide novel sample complexity and regret guarantees for nominal receding-horizon LQ controllers in a learning-based setting. We show that an adaptive prediction horizon that increases as a logarithmic function of time is beneficial for regret minimization.

Title: Gaussian Process-Based Nonlinear Moving Horizon Estimation
Authors: Tobias M. Wolff, Victor G. Lopez, Matthias A. Müller
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel Gaussian process-based moving horizon estimation (MHE) framework for unknown nonlinear systems. On the one hand, we approximate the system dynamics by the posterior means of the learned Gaussian processes (GPs). On the other hand, we exploit the posterior variances of the Gaussian processes to design the weighting matrices in the MHE cost function and account for the uncertainty in the learned system dynamics. The data collection and the tuning of the hyperparameters are done offline. We prove robust stability of the GP-based MHE scheme using a Lyapunov-based proof technique. Furthermore, as additional contribution, we derive a sufficient condition under which incremental input/output-to-state stability (a nonlinear detectability notion) is preserved when approximating the system dynamics using, e.g., machine learning techniques. Finally, we illustrate the performance of the GP-based MHE scheme in two simulation case studies and show how the chosen weighting matrices can lead to an improved performance compared to standard cost functions.

Title: Consensus seeking in diffusive multidimensional networks with a repeated interaction pattern and time-delays
Authors: Hoang Huy Vu, Quyen Ngoc Nguyen, Tuynh Van Pham, Chuong Van Nguyen, Minh Hoang Trinh
Abstract: This paper studies a consensus problem in multidimensional networks having the same agent-to-agent interaction pattern under both intra- and cross-layer time delays. Several conditions for the agents to asymptotically reach a consensus are derived, which involve the overall network's structure, the local interacting pattern, and the assumptions specified on the time delays. The validity of these conditions is proved by direct eigenvalue evaluation and supported by numerical simulations.

Title: Zak-OTFS to Integrate Sensing the I/O Relation and Data Communication
Authors: Muhammad Ubadah, Saif Khan Mohammed, Ronny Hadani, Shachar Kons, Ananthanarayanan Chockalingam, Robert Calderbank
Abstract: The Zak-OTFS input/output (I/O) relation is predictable and non-fading when the delay and Doppler periods are greater than the effective channel delay and Doppler spreads, a condition which we refer to as the crystallization condition. The filter taps can simply be read off from the response to a single Zak-OTFS point (impulse) pulsone waveform, and the I/O relation can be reconstructed for a sampled system that operates under finite duration and bandwidth constraints. Predictability opens up the possibility of a model-free mode of operation. The time-domain realization of a Zak-OTFS point pulsone is a pulse train modulated by a tone, hence the name, pulsone. The Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of a pulsone is about $15$ dB, and we describe a general method for constructing a spread pulsone for which the time-domain realization has a PAPR of about 6dB. We construct the spread pulsone by applying a type of discrete spreading filter to a Zak-OTFS point pulsone. The self-ambiguity function of the point pulsone is supported on the period lattice ${\Lambda}_{p}$, and by applying a discrete chirp filter, we obtain a spread pulsone with a self-ambiguity function that is supported on a rotated lattice ${\Lambda^*}$. We show that if the channel satisfies the crystallization conditions with respect to ${\Lambda^*}$ then the effective DD domain filter taps can simply be read off from the cross-ambiguity between the channel response to the spread pulsone and the transmitted spread pulsone. If, in addition, the channel satisfies the crystallization conditions with respect to the period lattice ${\Lambda}_{p}$, then in an OTFS frame consisting of a spread pilot pulsone and point data pulsones, after cancelling the received signal corresponding to the spread pulsone, we can recover the channel response to any data pulsone.

Title: Robust and tractable multidimensional exponential analysis
Authors: H. N. Mhaskar, S. Kitimoon, Raghu G. Raj
Abstract: Motivated by a number of applications in signal processing, we study the following question. Given samples of a multidimensional signal of the form $$ f(\boldsymbol\ell)=\sum_{k=1}^K a_k\exp(-i\langle \boldsymbol\ell, \mathbf{w}_k\rangle), \quad \mathbf{w}_1,\cdots,\mathbf{w}_k\in\mathbb{R}^q, \ \boldsymbol\ell\in \mathbb{Z}^q, \ |\boldsymbol\ell| <n, $$ determine the values of the number $K$ of components, and the parameters $a_k$ and $\mathbf{w}_k$'s. We note that the the number of samples of $f$ in the above equation is $(2n-1)^q$. We develop an algorithm to recuperate these quantities accurately using only a subsample of size $\mathcal{O}(qn)$ of this data. For this purpose, we use a novel localized kernel method to identify the parameters, including the number $K$ of signals. Our method is easy to implement, and is shown to be stable under a very low SNR range. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our resulting algorithm using 2 and 3 dimensional examples from the literature, and show substantial improvements over state-of-the-art techniques including Prony based, MUSIC and ESPRIT approaches.

Title: Learning Li-ion battery health and degradation modes from data with aging-aware circuit models
Authors: Zihao Zhou, Antti Aitio, David Howey
Abstract: Non-invasive estimation of Li-ion battery state-of-health from operational data is valuable for battery applications, but remains challenging. Pure model-based methods may suffer from inaccuracy and long-term instability of parameter estimates, whereas pure data-driven methods rely heavily on training data quality and quantity, causing lack of generality when extrapolating to unseen cases. We apply an aging-aware equivalent circuit model for health estimation, combining the flexibility of data-driven techniques within a model-based approach. A simplified electrical model with voltage source and resistor incorporates Gaussian process regression to learn capacity fade over time and also the dependence of resistance on operating conditions and time. The approach was validated against two datasets and shown to give accurate performance with less than 1% relative root mean square error (RMSE) in capacity and less than 2% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Critically, we show that the open circuit voltage versus state-of-charge function must be accurately known, and any inaccuracies or changes in this over time strongly influence the inferred resistance. However, this feature (or bug) may also be used to estimate in operando differential voltage curves from operational data.

Abstract: Pediatric central nervous system tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children. The five-year survival rate for high-grade glioma in children is less than 20%. The development of new treatments is dependent upon multi-institutional collaborative clinical trials requiring reproducible and accurate centralized response assessment. We present the results of the BraTS-PEDs 2023 challenge, the first Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge focused on pediatric brain tumors. This challenge utilized data acquired from multiple international consortia dedicated to pediatric neuro-oncology and clinical trials. BraTS-PEDs 2023 aimed to evaluate volumetric segmentation algorithms for pediatric brain gliomas from magnetic resonance imaging using standardized quantitative performance evaluation metrics employed across the BraTS 2023 challenges. The top-performing AI approaches for pediatric tumor analysis included ensembles of nnU-Net and Swin UNETR, Auto3DSeg, or nnU-Net with a self-supervised framework. The BraTSPEDs 2023 challenge fostered collaboration between clinicians (neuro-oncologists, neuroradiologists) and AI/imaging scientists, promoting faster data sharing and the development of automated volumetric analysis techniques. These advancements could significantly benefit clinical trials and improve the care of children with brain tumors.

Title: BIRA: A Spherical Bistatic Radar Reflectivity Measurement System
Authors: Carsten Andrich, Tobias F. Nowack, Alexander Ihlow, Sebastian Giehl, Maximilian Engelhardt, Gerd Sommerkorn, Andreas Schwind, Willi Hofmann, Christian Bornkessel, Matthias A. Hein, Reiner S. Thomä
Abstract: The upcoming 6G mobile communication standard will offer a revolutionary new feature: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) reuses mobile communication signals to realize multi-static radar for various applications including localization. Consequently, applied ISAC propagation research necessitates to evolve from classical monostatic radar cross section (RCS) measurement of static targets on to bistatic radar reflectivity characterization of dynamic objects. Here, we introduce our Bistatic Radar (BIRA) measurement facility for independent spherical positioning of two probes with sub-millimeter accuracy on a diameter of up to 7 m and with almost continuous frequency coverage from 0.7 up to 260 GHz. Currently, BIRA is the only bistatic measurement facility capable of unrestricted ISAC research: In addition to vector network analysis, it employs advanced wideband transceiver technology with an instantaneous bandwidth of up to 4 GHz. These transceivers grant BIRA the unique capability to characterize dynamic targets in both Doppler and range, while also significantly accelerating measurements on static objects. Additionally, the installation is capable of spherical near-field antenna measurements over these wide frequency ranges.

Title: Iterative approach to reconstructing neural disparity fields from light-field data
Authors: Ligen Shi, Chang Liu, Xing Zhao, Jun Qiu
Abstract: This study proposes a neural disparity field (NDF) that establishes an implicit, continuous representation of scene disparity based on a neural field and an iterative approach to address the inverse problem of NDF reconstruction from light-field data. NDF enables seamless and precise characterization of disparity variations in three-dimensional scenes and can discretize disparity at any arbitrary resolution, overcoming the limitations of traditional disparity maps that are prone to sampling errors and interpolation inaccuracies. The proposed NDF network architecture utilizes hash encoding combined with multilayer perceptrons to capture detailed disparities in texture levels, thereby enhancing its ability to represent the geometric information of complex scenes. By leveraging the spatial-angular consistency inherent in light-field data, a differentiable forward model to generate a central view image from the light-field data is developed. Based on the forward model, an optimization scheme for the inverse problem of NDF reconstruction using differentiable propagation operators is established. Furthermore, an iterative solution method is adopted to reconstruct the NDF in the optimization scheme, which does not require training datasets and applies to light-field data captured by various acquisition methods. Experimental results demonstrate that high-quality NDF can be reconstructed from light-field data using the proposed method. High-resolution disparity can be effectively recovered by NDF, demonstrating its capability for the implicit, continuous representation of scene disparities.

Title: Practical Challenges for Reliable RIS Deployment in Heterogeneous Multi-Operator Multi-Band Networks
Authors: Mehdi Monemi, Mehdi Rasti, Arthur S. de Sena, Mohammad Amir Fallah, Matti Latva-Aho, Marco Di Renzo
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been introduced as arrays of nearly passive elements with software-tunable electromagnetic properties to dynamically manipulate the reflection/transmission of radio signals. Research works in this area are focused on two applications, namely {\it user-assist} RIS aiming at tuning the RIS to enhance the quality-of-service (QoS) of target users, and the {\it malicious} RIS aiming for an attacker to degrade the QoS at victim receivers through generating {\it intended} destructive interference. While both user-assist and malicious RIS applications have been explored extensively, the impact of RIS deployments on imposing {\it unintended} interference on various wireless user-equipments (EUs) remains underexplored. This paper investigates the challenges of integrating RISs into multi-carrier, multi-user, and multi-operator networks. We discuss how RIS deployments intended to benefit specific users can negatively impact other users served at various carrier frequencies through different network operators. While not an ideal solution, we discuss how ultra-narrowband metasurfaces can be incorporated into the manufacturing of RISs to mitigate some challenges of RIS deployment in wireless networks. We also present a simulation scenario to illuminate some practical challenges associated with the deployment of RISs in shared public environments.

Title: Performance Analysis of Joint Antenna Selection and Precoding Methods in Multi-user Massive MISO
Authors: Xiuxiu Ma, Abla Kammoun, Mohamed-Slim Alouini, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri
Abstract: This paper presents a performance analysis of two distinct techniques for antenna selection and precoding in downlink multi-user massive multiple-input single-output systems with limited dynamic range power amplifiers. Both techniques are derived from the original formulation of the regularized-zero forcing precoder, designed as the solution to minimizing a regularized distortion. Based on this, the first technique, called the $\ell_1$-norm precoder, adopts an $\ell_1$-norm regularization term to encourage sparse solutions, thereby enabling antenna selection. The second technique, termed the thresholded $\ell_1$-norm precoder, involves post-processing the precoder solution obtained from the first method by applying an entry-wise thresholding operation. This work conducts a precise performance analysis to compare these two techniques. The analysis leverages the Gaussian min-max theorem which is effective for examining the asymptotic behavior of optimization problems without explicit solutions. While the analysis of the $\ell_1$-norm precoder follows the conventional Gaussian min-max theorem framework, understanding the thresholded $\ell_1$-norm precoder is more complex due to the non-linear behavior introduced by the thresholding operation. To address this complexity, we develop a novel Gaussian min-max theorem tailored to these scenarios. We provide precise asymptotic behavior analysis of the precoders, focusing on metrics such as received signal-to-noise and distortion ratio and bit error rate. Our analysis demonstrates that the thresholded $\ell_1$-norm precoder can offer superior performance when the threshold parameter is carefully selected. Simulations confirm that the asymptotic results are accurate for systems equipped with hundreds of antennas at the base station, serving dozens of user terminals.

Title: Ring Artifacts Removal Based on Implicit Neural Representation of Sinogram Data
Authors: Ligen Shi, Xu Jiang, YunZe Liu, Chang Liu, Ping Yang, Shifeng Guo, Xing Zhao
Abstract: Inconsistent responses of X-ray detector elements lead to stripe artifacts in the sinogram data, which manifest as ring artifacts in the reconstructed CT images, severely degrading image quality. This paper proposes a method for correcting stripe artifacts in the sinogram data. The proposed method leverages implicit neural representation (INR) to correct defective pixel response values using implicit continuous functions and simultaneously learns stripe features in the angular direction of the sinogram data. These two components are combined within an optimization constraint framework, achieving unsupervised iterative correction of stripe artifacts in the projection domain. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques in removing ring artifacts while maintaining the clarity of CT images.

Title: Segment as You Wish -- Free-Form Language-Based Segmentation for Medical Images
Authors: Longchao Da, Rui Wang, Xiaojian Xu, Parminder Bhatia, Taha Kass-Hout, Hua Wei, Cao Xiao
Abstract: Medical imaging is crucial for diagnosing a patient's health condition, and accurate segmentation of these images is essential for isolating regions of interest to ensure precise diagnosis and treatment planning. Existing methods primarily rely on bounding boxes or point-based prompts, while few have explored text-related prompts, despite clinicians often describing their observations and instructions in natural language. To address this gap, we first propose a RAG-based free-form text prompt generator, that leverages the domain corpus to generate diverse and realistic descriptions. Then, we introduce FLanS, a novel medical image segmentation model that handles various free-form text prompts, including professional anatomy-informed queries, anatomy-agnostic position-driven queries, and anatomy-agnostic size-driven queries. Additionally, our model also incorporates a symmetry-aware canonicalization module to ensure consistent, accurate segmentations across varying scan orientations and reduce confusion between the anatomical position of an organ and its appearance in the scan. FLanS is trained on a large-scale dataset of over 100k medical images from 7 public datasets. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the model's superior language understanding and segmentation precision, along with a deep comprehension of the relationship between them, outperforming SOTA baselines on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.

Title: A Global Coordinate-Free Approach to Invariant Contraction on Homogeneous Manifolds
Authors: Akash Harapanahalli, Samuel Coogan
Abstract: In this work, we provide a global condition for contraction with respect to an invariant Riemannian metric on reductive homogeneous spaces. Using left-invariant frames, vector fields on the manifold are horizontally lifted to the ambient Lie group, where the Levi-Civita connection is globally characterized as a real matrix multiplication. By linearizing in these left-invariant frames, we characterize contraction using matrix measures on real square matrices, avoiding the use of local charts. Applying this global condition, we provide a necessary condition for a prescribed subset of the manifold to possibly admit a contracting system, which accounts for the underlying geometry of the invariant metric. Applied to the sphere, this condition implies that no great circle can be contained in a contraction region. Finally, we apply our results to compute reachable sets for an attitude control problem.

Title: Pixel super-resolved virtual staining of label-free tissue using diffusion models
Authors: Yijie Zhang, Luzhe Huang, Nir Pillar, Yuzhu Li, Hanlong Chen, Aydogan Ozcan
Abstract: Virtual staining of tissue offers a powerful tool for transforming label-free microscopy images of unstained tissue into equivalents of histochemically stained samples. This study presents a diffusion model-based super-resolution virtual staining approach utilizing a Brownian bridge process to enhance both the spatial resolution and fidelity of label-free virtual tissue staining, addressing the limitations of traditional deep learning-based methods. Our approach integrates novel sampling techniques into a diffusion model-based image inference process to significantly reduce the variance in the generated virtually stained images, resulting in more stable and accurate outputs. Blindly applied to lower-resolution auto-fluorescence images of label-free human lung tissue samples, the diffusion-based super-resolution virtual staining model consistently outperformed conventional approaches in resolution, structural similarity and perceptual accuracy, successfully achieving a super-resolution factor of 4-5x, increasing the output space-bandwidth product by 16-25-fold compared to the input label-free microscopy images. Diffusion-based super-resolved virtual tissue staining not only improves resolution and image quality but also enhances the reliability of virtual staining without traditional chemical staining, offering significant potential for clinical diagnostics.

Title: Identification and Clustering of Unseen Ragas in Indian Art Music
Authors: Parampreet Singh, Adwik Gupta, Aakarsh Mishra, Vipul Arora
Abstract: Raga classification in Indian Art Music is an open-set problem where unseen classes may appear during testing. However, traditional approaches often treat it as a closed set problem, rejecting the possibility of encountering unseen classes. In this work, we try to tackle this problem by first employing an Uncertainty-based Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection, given a set containing known and unknown classes. Next, for the audio samples identified as OOD, we employ Novel Class Discovery (NCD) approach to cluster them into distinct unseen Raga classes. We achieve this by harnessing information from labelled data and further applying contrastive learning on unlabelled data. With thorough analysis, we demonstrate the influence of different components of the loss function on clustering performance and examine how varying openness affects the NCD task in hand.

Title: Quantifying the benefit of load uncertainty reduction for the design of district energy systems under grid constraints using the Value of Information
Authors: Max Langtry, Ruchi Choudhary
Abstract: Load uncertainty must be accounted for during design to ensure building energy systems can meet energy demands during operation. Reducing building load uncertainty allows for improved designs with less compromise to be identified, reducing the cost of decarbonizing energy usage. However, the building monitoring required to reduce load uncertainty is costly. This study uses Value of Information analysis (VoI) to quantify the economic benefit of practical building monitoring for supporting energy system design decisions, and determine if its benefits outweigh its cost. An extension of the VoI framework, termed 'On-Policy' VoI, is proposed, which admits complex decision making tasks where decision policies are required. This is applied to a case study district energy system design problem, where a Linear Program model is used to size solar-battery systems and grid connection capacity under uncertain building loads, modelled using historic electricity metering data. Load uncertainty is found to significantly impact both system operating costs ($\pm$30%) and the optimal system design ($\pm$20%). However, using building monitoring data to improve the design of the district reduces overall costs by less than 1.5% on average. As this is less than the cost of measurement, using monitoring is not economically worthwhile in this case. This provides the first numerical evidence to support the sufficiency of using standard building load profiles for energy system design. Further, reducing only uncertainty in mean load is found to provide most of the available decision support benefit, meaning using hourly measurement data provides little benefit for energy retrofit design.

Title: A behavioral approach for LPV data-driven representations
Authors: Chris Verhoek, Ivan Markovsky, Sofie Haesaert, Roland Tóth
Abstract: In this paper, we present a data-driven representation for linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems, which can be used for direct data-driven analysis and control of such systems. Specifically, we use the behavioral approach to develop a data-driven representation of the finite-horizon behavior of LPV systems for which there exists a kernel representation with shifted-affine scheduling dependence. Moreover, we provide a necessary and sufficient rank-based test on the available data that concludes whether the data fully represents the finite-horizon LPV behavior. Using the proposed data-driven representation, we also solve the data-driven simulation problem for LPV systems. Through multiple examples, we demonstrate that the results in this paper allow us to formulate a novel set of direct data-driven analysis and control methods for LPV systems, which are also applicable for LPV embeddings of nonlinear systems.

Title: Asymptotic Analysis of One-bit Quantized Box-Constrained Precoding in Large-Scale Multi-User Systems
Authors: Xiuxiu Ma, Abla Kammoun, Mohamed-Slim Alouini, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri
Abstract: This paper addresses the design of multi-antenna precoding strategies, considering hardware limitations such as low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs), which necessitate the quantization of transmitted signals. The typical approach starts with optimizing a precoder, followed by a quantization step to meet hardware requirements. This study analyzes the performance of a quantization scheme applied to the box-constrained regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoder in the asymptotic regime, where the number of antennas and users grows proportionally. The box constraint, initially designed to cope with low-dynamic range amplifiers, is used here to control quantization noise rather than for amplifier compatibility. A significant challenge in analyzing the quantized precoder is that the input to the quantization operation does not follow a Gaussian distribution, making traditional methods such as Bussgang's decomposition unsuitable. To overcome this, the paper extends the Gordon's inequality and introduces a novel Gaussian Min-Max Theorem to model the distribution of the channel-distorted precoded signal. The analysis derives the tight lower bound for the signal-to-distortion-plus-noise ratio (SDNR) and the bit error rate (BER), showing that optimal tuning of the amplitude constraint improves performance.

Title: Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation Over-the-Air in OFDM Systems
Authors: Biao Dong, Bin Cao, Qinyu Zhang
Abstract: This work is concerned with integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC) in uplink orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, wherein multiple devices perform target sensing and over-the-air computation (AirComp) simultaneously. We aim to minimize the computational mean squared error (MSE) by jointly optimizing the transmitting vector and the aggregation vector. To tackle the non-convexity of this problem, we develop a two-phase iterative algorithm. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Title: Assessing workflow impact and clinical utility of AI-assisted brain aneurysm detection: a multi-reader study
Authors: Tommaso Di Noto, Sofyan Jankowski, Francesco Puccinelli, Guillaume Marie, Sebastien Tourbier, Yasser Aleman-Gomez, Oscar Esteban, Ricardo Corredor-Jerez, Guillaume Saliou, Patric Hagmann, Meritxell Bach Cuadra, Jonas Richiardi
Abstract: Despite the plethora of AI-based algorithms developed for anomaly detection in radiology, subsequent integration into clinical setting is rarely evaluated. In this work, we assess the applicability and utility of an AI-based model for brain aneurysm detection comparing the performance of two readers with different levels of experience (2 and 13 years). We aim to answer the following questions: 1) Do the readers improve their performance when assisted by the AI algorithm? 2) How much does the AI algorithm impact routine clinical workflow? We reuse and enlarge our open-access, Time-Of-Flight Magnetic Resonance Angiography dataset (N=460). We use 360 subjects for training/validating our algorithm and 100 as unseen test set for the reading session. Even though our model reaches state-of-the-art results on the test set (sensitivity=74%, false positive rate=1.6), we show that neither the junior nor the senior reader significantly increase their sensitivity (p=0.59, p=1, respectively). In addition, we find that reading time for both readers is significantly higher in the "AI-assisted" setting than in the "Unassisted" (+15 seconds, on average; p=3x10^(-4) junior, p=3x10^(-5) senior). The confidence reported by the readers is unchanged across the two settings, indicating that the AI assistance does not influence the certainty of the diagnosis. Our findings highlight the importance of clinical validation of AI algorithms in a clinical setting involving radiologists. This study should serve as a reminder to the community to always examine the real-word effectiveness and workflow impact of proposed algorithms.

Title: MedSegNet10: A Publicly Accessible Network Repository for Split Federated Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Chamani Shiranthika, Zahra Hafezi Kafshgari, Hadi Hadizadeh, Parvaneh Saeedi
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) have shown significant promise in healthcare, particularly in medical image segmentation, which is crucial for accurate disease diagnosis and treatment planning. Despite their potential, challenges such as data privacy concerns, limited annotated data, and inadequate training data persist. Decentralized learning approaches such as federated learning (FL), split learning (SL), and split federated learning (SplitFed/SFL) address these issues effectively. This paper introduces "MedSegNet10," a publicly accessible repository designed for medical image segmentation using split-federated learning. MedSegNet10 provides a collection of pre-trained neural network architectures optimized for various medical image types, including microscopic images of human blastocysts, dermatoscopic images of skin lesions, and endoscopic images of lesions, polyps, and ulcers, with applications extending beyond these examples. By leveraging SplitFed's benefits, MedSegNet10 allows collaborative training on privately stored, horizontally split data, ensuring privacy and integrity. This repository supports researchers, practitioners, trainees, and data scientists, aiming to advance medical image segmentation while maintaining patient data privacy.

Title: Identification of additive multivariable continuous-time systems
Authors: Maarten van der Hulst, Rodrigo González, Koen Classens, Nic Dirkx, Jeroen van de Wijdeven, Tom Oomen
Abstract: Multivariable parametric models are critical for designing, controlling, and optimizing the performance of engineered systems. The main aim of this paper is to develop a parametric identification strategy that delivers accurate and physically relevant models of multivariable systems using time-domain data. The introduced approach adopts an additive model structure, providing a parsimonious and interpretable representation of many physical systems, and applies a refined instrumental variable-based estimation algorithm. The developed identification method enables the estimation of multivariable parametric additive models in continuous time and is applicable to both open- and closed-loop systems. The performance of the estimator is demonstrated through numerical simulations and experimentally validated on a flexible beam system.

Title: The Cesàro Value Iteration
Authors: Jonas Mair, Lukas Schwenkel, Matthias A. Müller, Frank Allgöwer
Abstract: In this paper, we consider undiscouted infinitehorizon optimal control for deterministic systems with an uncountable state and input space. We specifically address the case when the classic value iteration does not converge. For such systems, we use the Ces`aro mean to define the infinite-horizon optimal control problem and the corresponding infinite-horizon value function. Moreover, for this value function, we introduce the Cesàro value iteration and prove its convergence for the special case of systems with periodic optimal operating behavior. For this instance, we also show that the Cesàro value function recovers the undiscounted infinite-horizon optimal cost, if the latter is well-defined.

Title: Controlling Complex Systems
Authors: Marco Coraggio, Davide Salzano, Mario di Bernardo
Abstract: This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of controlling collective behavior in complex systems comprising large ensembles of interacting dynamical agents. Building upon traditional control theory's foundation in individual systems, we introduce tools designed to address the unique challenges of coordinating networks that exhibit emergent phenomena, including consensus, synchronization, and pattern formation. We analyze how local agent interactions generate macroscopic behaviors and investigate the fundamental role of network topology in determining system dynamics. Inspired by natural systems, we emphasize control strategies that achieve global coordination through localized interventions while considering practical implementation challenges. The chapter concludes by presenting novel frameworks for managing very large agent ensembles and leveraging interacting networks for control purposes.

Title: ESC-MVQ: End-to-End Semantic Communication With Multi-Codebook Vector Quantization
Authors: Junyong Shin, Yongjeong Oh, Jinsung Park, Joohyuk Park, Yo-Seb Jeon
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel end-to-end digital semantic communication framework based on multi-codebook vector quantization (VQ), referred to as ESC-MVQ. Unlike prior approaches that rely on end-to-end training with a specific power or modulation scheme, often under a particular channel condition, ESC-MVQ models a channel transfer function as parallel binary symmetric channels (BSCs) with trainable bit-flip probabilities. Building on this model, ESC-MVQ jointly trains multiple VQ codebooks and their associated bit-flip probabilities with a single encoder-decoder pair. To maximize inference performance when deploying ESC-MVQ in digital communication systems, we devise an optimal communication strategy that jointly optimizes codebook assignment, adaptive modulation, and power allocation. To this end, we develop an iterative algorithm that selects the most suitable VQ codebook for semantic features and flexibly allocates power and modulation schemes across the transmitted symbols. Simulation results demonstrate that ESC-MVQ, using a single encoder-decoder pair, outperforms existing digital semantic communication methods in both performance and memory efficiency, offering a scalable and adaptive solution for realizing digital semantic communication in diverse channel conditions.

Title: A Deep Learning-Based Supervised Transfer Learning Framework for DOA Estimation with Array Imperfections
Authors: Bo Zhou, Kaijie Xu, Yinghui Quan, Mengdao Xing
Abstract: In practical scenarios, processes such as sensor design, manufacturing, and installation will introduce certain errors. Furthermore, mutual interference occurs when the sensors receive signals. These defects in array systems are referred to as array imperfections, which can significantly degrade the performance of Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation. In this study, we propose a deep-learning based transfer learning approach, which effectively mitigates the degradation of deep-learning based DOA estimation performance caused by array imperfections. In the proposed approach, we highlight three major contributions. First, we propose a Vision Transformer (ViT) based method for DOA estimation, which achieves excellent performance in scenarios with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and limited snapshots. Second, we introduce a transfer learning framework that extends deep learning models from ideal simulation scenarios to complex real-world scenarios with array imperfections. By leveraging prior knowledge from ideal simulation data, the proposed transfer learning framework significantly improves deep learning-based DOA estimation performance in the presence of array imperfections, without the need for extensive real-world data. Finally, we incorporate visualization and evaluation metrics to assess the performance of DOA estimation algorithms, which allow for a more thorough evaluation of algorithms and further validate the proposed method.

Title: Theoretical Grid-Forming Extreme of Inverters
Authors: Qianxi Tang, Li Peng
Abstract: What are the theoretical and physical limits of a grid-forming inverter? This letter proposes that the extreme grid-forming ability of inverters is limited by their dc-side, ac-side, circuit topology dynamics, but not control. While many papers focus on how to improve grid-forming inverters stability, power sharing, inertia emulation, fault response, few, if any, formally define the fundamental theoretical limits or extremes of grid-forming behavior. It seems that the grid-forming can be improved endlessly. No physical system can support a grid indefinitely without limitations, especially under increasing levels of disturbance or uncertainty. Therefore, this boundary is explicitly shown by a mathematical expression in this letter. Consequently, the results show that relatively low dc-side voltage and high active power injection could damage the grid-forming ability. Poor consideration of dc-side, ac-side, and circuit topology dynamics in real practice will cause jeopardizing oscillation even by the theoretical best grid-forming control strategy.

Title: MFA-KWS: Effective Keyword Spotting with Multi-head Frame-asynchronous Decoding
Authors: Yu Xi, Haoyu Li, Xiaoyu Gu, Yidi Jiang, Kai Yu
Abstract: Keyword spotting (KWS) is essential for voice-driven applications, demanding both accuracy and efficiency. Traditional ASR-based KWS methods, such as greedy and beam search, explore the entire search space without explicitly prioritizing keyword detection, often leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose an effective keyword-specific KWS framework by introducing a streaming-oriented CTC-Transducer-combined frame-asynchronous system with multi-head frame-asynchronous decoding (MFA-KWS). Specifically, MFA-KWS employs keyword-specific phone-synchronous decoding for CTC and replaces conventional RNN-T with Token-and-Duration Transducer to enhance both performance and efficiency. Furthermore, we explore various score fusion strategies, including single-frame-based and consistency-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of MFA-KWS, which achieves state-of-the-art results on both fixed keyword and arbitrary keywords datasets, such as Snips, MobvoiHotwords, and LibriKWS-20, while exhibiting strong robustness in noisy environments. Among fusion strategies, the consistency-based CDC-Last method delivers the best performance. Additionally, MFA-KWS achieves a 47% to 63% speed-up over the frame-synchronous baselines across various datasets. Extensive experimental results confirm that MFA-KWS is an effective and efficient KWS framework, making it well-suited for on-device deployment.

Title: From Alignment to Advancement: Bootstrapping Audio-Language Alignment with Synthetic Data
Authors: Chun-Yi Kuan, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) have recently made great strides in understanding and processing audio inputs. These models are typically adapted from text-based large language models (LLMs) through additional training on audio-related tasks. However, this adaptation process presents two major limitations. First, ALLMs often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where crucial textual capabilities like instruction-following are lost after training on audio data. In some cases, models may even hallucinate sounds that are not present in the input audio, raising concerns about reliability. Second, achieving cross-modal alignment between audio and language typically relies on large collections of task-specific question-answer pairs for instruction tuning, making it resource-intensive. To address these issues, previous works have leveraged the backbone LLMs to synthesize general-purpose, caption-style alignment data. In this paper, we propose a data generation framework that produces contrastive-like training data, designed to enhance ALLMs' ability to differentiate between present and absent sounds. We further extend our approach to multi-audio scenarios, enabling the model to either explain differences between audio inputs or produce unified captions that describe all inputs, thereby enhancing audio-language alignment. We refer to the entire ALLM training framework as bootstrapping audio-language alignment via synthetic data generation from backbone LLMs (BALSa). Experimental results indicate that our method effectively mitigates audio hallucinations while reliably maintaining strong performance on audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks, as well as instruction-following skills. Moreover, incorporating multi-audio training further enhances the model's comprehension and reasoning capabilities. Overall, BALSa offers an efficient and scalable approach to developing ALLMs.

Authors: Jiachen Zhong, Yiting Wang, Di Zhu, Ziwei Wang
Abstract: Lung cancer remains one of the most prevalent and fatal diseases worldwide, demanding accurate and timely diagnosis and treatment. Recent advancements in large AI models have significantly enhanced medical image understanding and clinical decision-making. This review systematically surveys the state-of-the-art in applying large AI models to lung cancer screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. We categorize existing models into modality-specific encoders, encoder-decoder frameworks, and joint encoder architectures, highlighting key examples such as CLIP, BLIP, Flamingo, BioViL-T, and GLoRIA. We further examine their performance in multimodal learning tasks using benchmark datasets like LIDC-IDRI, NLST, and MIMIC-CXR. Applications span pulmonary nodule detection, gene mutation prediction, multi-omics integration, and personalized treatment planning, with emerging evidence of clinical deployment and validation. Finally, we discuss current limitations in generalizability, interpretability, and regulatory compliance, proposing future directions for building scalable, explainable, and clinically integrated AI systems. Our review underscores the transformative potential of large AI models to personalize and optimize lung cancer care.

Title: Adaptive event-triggered robust tracking control of soft robots
Authors: Renjie Ma, Ziyao Qu, Zhijian Hu, Dong Zhao, Marios M. Polycarpou
Abstract: Soft robots manufactured with flexible materials can be highly compliant and adaptive to their surroundings, which facilitates their application in areas such as dexterous manipulation and environmental exploration. This paper aims at investigating the tracking control problem for soft robots under uncertainty such as unmodeled dynamics and external disturbance. First, we establish a novel switching function and design the compensated tracking error dynamics by virtue of the command filter. Then, based on the backstepping methodology, the virtual controllers and the adaptive logic estimating the supremum of uncertainty impacts are developed for synthesizing an event-triggered control strategy. In addition, the uniformed finite-time stability certification is derived for different scenarios of the switching function. Finally, we perform a case study of a soft robot to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.

Title: Score-based Generative Diffusion Models to Synthesize Full-dose FDG Brain PET from MRI in Epilepsy Patients
Authors: Jiaqi Wu, Jiahong Ouyang, Farshad Moradi, Mohammad Mehdi Khalighi, Greg Zaharchuk
Abstract: Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET to evaluate patients with epilepsy is one of the most common applications for simultaneous PET/MRI, given the need to image both brain structure and metabolism, but is suboptimal due to the radiation dose in this young population. Little work has been done synthesizing diagnostic quality PET images from MRI data or MRI data with ultralow-dose PET using advanced generative AI methods, such as diffusion models, with attention to clinical evaluations tailored for the epilepsy population. Here we compared the performance of diffusion- and non-diffusion-based deep learning models for the MRI-to-PET image translation task for epilepsy imaging using simultaneous PET/MRI in 52 subjects (40 train/2 validate/10 hold-out test). We tested three different models: 2 score-based generative diffusion models (SGM-Karras Diffusion [SGM-KD] and SGM-variance preserving [SGM-VP]) and a Transformer-Unet. We report results on standard image processing metrics as well as clinically relevant metrics, including congruency measures (Congruence Index and Congruency Mean Absolute Error) that assess hemispheric metabolic asymmetry, which is a key part of the clinical analysis of these images. The SGM-KD produced the best qualitative and quantitative results when synthesizing PET purely from T1w and T2 FLAIR images with the least mean absolute error in whole-brain specific uptake value ratio (SUVR) and highest intraclass correlation coefficient. When 1% low-dose PET images are included in the inputs, all models improve significantly and are interchangeable for quantitative performance and visual quality. In summary, SGMs hold great potential for pure MRI-to-PET translation, while all 3 model types can synthesize full-dose FDG-PET accurately using MRI and ultralow-dose PET.

Title: Symmetric Sliding-Mode Control of Grid-Forming Inverters With Controllable Region Under AC and DC Sides Varying
Authors: Qianxi Tang, Li Peng
Abstract: Conventional grid-forming (GFM) controls often entangle voltage formation with power flow and dc-source dynamics, which can degrade voltage tracking performance and stability under grid disturbances, load transients, and dc-side perturbations. To address this issue, a symmetric sliding-mode control (SSMC) method is developed and its explicit voltage controllable region is derived. It illustrates how much ac-side power dynamics and dc-link voltage varying can be decoupled from the voltage regulation task, which helps predict when the entangling appears. While conventional sliding-mode controls address voltage-tracking error through complex sliding surface designs, repetitive correction techniques or special reaching laws, this work identifies that the error at power-line frequency primarily stem from the asymmetry property of inverters with the delay effect and the computational inaccuracy. Guided by this insight, a symmetric compensation structure is proposed, which avoids added design complexity and directly mitigates low-frequency voltage tracking errors. Furthermore, the control design is supported by a physical and quantitative explanation, aiding in parameter tuning. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves faster tracking responses-on the order of hundreds of microseconds-while maintaining robust and more accurate tracking under both dc-link voltage and ac-side current variations. Conventional grid-forming and classical sliding-mode controllers, which handle these disturbances separately, cannot match this combined speed and robustness. Furthermore, the voltage controllability analysis is explicitly verified.

Title: CMI-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Music Instruction Following
Authors: Yinghao Ma, Siyou Li, Juntao Yu, Emmanouil Benetos, Akira Maezawa
Abstract: Recent advances in audio-text large language models (LLMs) have opened new possibilities for music understanding and generation. However, existing benchmarks are limited in scope, often relying on simplified tasks or multi-choice evaluations that fail to reflect the complexity of real-world music analysis. We reinterpret a broad range of traditional MIR annotations as instruction-following formats and introduce CMI-Bench, a comprehensive music instruction following benchmark designed to evaluate audio-text LLMs on a diverse set of music information retrieval (MIR) tasks. These include genre classification, emotion regression, emotion tagging, instrument classification, pitch estimation, key detection, lyrics transcription, melody extraction, vocal technique recognition, instrument performance technique detection, music tagging, music captioning, and (down)beat tracking: reflecting core challenges in MIR research. Unlike previous benchmarks, CMI-Bench adopts standardized evaluation metrics consistent with previous state-of-the-art MIR models, ensuring direct comparability with supervised approaches. We provide an evaluation toolkit supporting all open-source audio-textual LLMs, including LTU, Qwen-audio, SALMONN, MusiLingo, etc. Experiment results reveal significant performance gaps between LLMs and supervised models, along with their culture, chronological and gender bias, highlighting the potential and limitations of current models in addressing MIR tasks. CMI-Bench establishes a unified foundation for evaluating music instruction following, driving progress in music-aware LLMs.

Abstract: In the field of speaker diarization, the development of technology is constrained by two problems: insufficient data resources and poor generalization ability of deep learning models. To address these two problems, firstly, we propose an automated method for constructing speaker diarization datasets, which generates more accurate pseudo-labels for massive data through the combination of audio and video. Relying on this method, we have released Multi-modal, Multi-scenario and Multi-language Speaker Diarization (M3SD) datasets. This dataset is derived from real network videos and is highly diverse. Our dataset and code have been open-sourced at this https URL.

Title: MDR-DeePC: Model-Inspired Distributionally Robust Data-Enabled Predictive Control
Authors: Shihao Li, Jiachen Li, Christopher Martin, Soovadeep Bakshi, Dongmei Chen
Abstract: This paper presents a Model-Inspired Distributionally Robust Data-enabled Predictive Control (MDR-DeePC) framework for systems with partially known and uncertain dynamics. The proposed method integrates model-based equality constraints for known dynamics with a Hankel matrix-based representation of unknown dynamics. A distributionally robust optimization problem is formulated to account for parametric uncertainty and stochastic disturbances. Simulation results on a triple-mass-spring-damper system demonstrate improved disturbance rejection, reduced output oscillations, and lower control cost compared to standard DeePC. The results validate the robustness and effectiveness of MDR-DeePC, with potential for real-time implementation pending further benchmarking.

Title: Fusing Radiomic Features with Deep Representations for Gestational Age Estimation in Fetal Ultrasound Images
Authors: Fangyijie Wang, Yuan Liang, Sourav Bhattacharjee, Abey Campbell, Kathleen M. Curran, Guénolé Silvestre
Abstract: Accurate gestational age (GA) estimation, ideally through fetal ultrasound measurement, is a crucial aspect of providing excellent antenatal care. However, deriving GA from manual fetal biometric measurements depends on the operator and is time-consuming. Hence, automatic computer-assisted methods are demanded in clinical practice. In this paper, we present a novel feature fusion framework to estimate GA using fetal ultrasound images without any measurement information. We adopt a deep learning model to extract deep representations from ultrasound images. We extract radiomic features to reveal patterns and characteristics of fetal brain growth. To harness the interpretability of radiomics in medical imaging analysis, we estimate GA by fusing radiomic features and deep representations. Our framework estimates GA with a mean absolute error of 8.0 days across three trimesters, outperforming current machine learning-based methods at these gestational ages. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness of our framework across different populations in diverse geographical regions. Our code is publicly available on \href{this https URL}.

Title: Identifiability and Maximum Likelihood Estimation for System Identification of Networks of Dynamical Systems
Authors: Anders Hansson, João Victor Galvão da Mata, Martin S. Andersen
Abstract: In this paper we investigate identifiability and maximum likelihood estimation for direct system identification of networks of dynamical systems. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for network identifiability in terms of Gröbner bases. We show that the maximum likelihood approach is both consistent and efficient, which is in contrast to existing prediction error approaches. Moreover, our approach has wider applicability, i.e., it is applicable whenever network identifiability holds. Finally, we show that we can formulate the maximum likelihood problem without the use of a predictor, which is the key to numerically being able to solve it efficiently.

Title: ThinkSound: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models for Audio Generation and Editing
Authors: Huadai Liu, Jialei Wang, Kaicheng Luo, Wen Wang, Qian Chen, Zhou Zhao, Wei Xue
Abstract: While end-to-end video-to-audio generation has greatly improved, producing high-fidelity audio that authentically captures the nuances of visual content remains challenging. Like professionals in the creative industries, such generation requires sophisticated reasoning about items such as visual dynamics, acoustic environments, and temporal relationships. We present ThinkSound, a novel framework that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to enable stepwise, interactive audio generation and editing for videos. Our approach decomposes the process into three complementary stages: foundational foley generation that creates semantically coherent soundscapes, interactive object-centric refinement through precise user interactions, and targeted editing guided by natural language instructions. At each stage, a multimodal large language model generates contextually aligned CoT reasoning that guides a unified audio foundation model. Furthermore, we introduce AudioCoT, a comprehensive dataset with structured reasoning annotations that establishes connections between visual content, textual descriptions, and sound synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that ThinkSound achieves state-of-the-art performance in video-to-audio generation across both audio metrics and CoT metrics and excels in out-of-distribution Movie Gen Audio benchmark.

Title: Dehazing Light Microscopy Images with Guided Conditional Flow Matching: finding a sweet spot between fidelity and realism
Authors: Anirban Ray, Ashesh, Florian Jug
Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is a major driver of scientific progress in the life sciences. Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering out-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as widefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data. Computational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to cheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off tells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high PSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID. Existing methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or produce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In this work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light microscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to find a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the realism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the conditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a hazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on 5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion and perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 7 baselines, achieving a consistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with calibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated predictions. Note that our method does not need an explicit degradation operator to exist, making it easily applicable on real microscopy data. All data used for training and evaluation and our code will be publicly available under a permissive license.

Title: Acousto-optic reconstruction of exterior sound field based on concentric circle sampling with circular harmonic expansion
Authors: Phuc Duc Nguyen, Kenji Ishikawa, Noboru Harada, Takehiro Moriya
Abstract: Acousto-optic sensing provides an alternative approach to traditional microphone arrays by shedding light on the interaction of light with an acoustic field. Sound field reconstruction is a fascinating and advanced technique used in acousto-optics sensing. Current challenges in sound-field reconstruction methods pertain to scenarios in which the sound source is located within the reconstruction area, known as the exterior problem. Existing reconstruction algorithms, primarily designed for interior scenarios, often exhibit suboptimal performance when applied to exterior cases. This paper introduces a novel technique for exterior sound-field reconstruction. The proposed method leverages concentric circle sampling and a two-dimensional exterior sound-field reconstruction approach based on circular harmonic extensions. To evaluate the efficacy of this approach, both numerical simulations and practical experiments are conducted. The results highlight the superior accuracy of the proposed method when compared to conventional reconstruction methods, all while utilizing a minimal amount of measured projection data.

Title: KnowSafe: Combined Knowledge and Data Driven Hazard Mitigation in Artificial Pancreas Systems
Authors: Xugui Zhou, Maxfield Kouzel, Chloe Smith, Homa Alemzadeh
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in anomaly detection and run-time monitoring to improve the safety and security of cyber-physical systems (CPS). However, less attention has been paid to hazard mitigation. This paper proposes a combined knowledge and data driven approach, KnowSafe, for the design of safety engines that can predict and mitigate safety hazards resulting from safety-critical malicious attacks or accidental faults targeting a CPS controller. We integrate domain-specific knowledge of safety constraints and context-specific mitigation actions with machine learning (ML) techniques to estimate system trajectories in the far and near future, infer potential hazards, and generate optimal corrective actions to keep the system safe. Experimental evaluation on two realistic closed-loop testbeds for artificial pancreas systems (APS) and a real-world clinical trial dataset for diabetes treatment demonstrates that KnowSafe outperforms the state-of-the-art by achieving higher accuracy in predicting system state trajectories and potential hazards, a low false positive rate, and no false negatives. It also maintains the safe operation of the simulated APS despite faults or attacks without introducing any new hazards, with a hazard mitigation success rate of 92.8%, which is at least 76% higher than solely rule-based (50.9%) and data-driven (52.7%) methods.

Title: Deep Multi-Manifold Transformation Based Multivariate Time Series Fault Detection
Authors: Hong Liu, Xiuxiu Qiu, Yiming Shi, Miao Xu, Zelin Zang, Zhen Lei
Abstract: Unsupervised fault detection in multivariate time series plays a vital role in ensuring the stable operation of complex systems. Traditional methods often assume that normal data follow a single Gaussian distribution and identify anomalies as deviations from this distribution. {\color{black} However, this simplified assumption fails to capture the diversity and structural complexity of real-world time series, which can lead to misjudgments and reduced detection performance in practical applications. To address this issue, we propose a new method that combines a neighborhood-driven data augmentation strategy with a multi-manifold representation learning framework.} By incorporating information from local neighborhoods, the augmentation module can simulate contextual variations of normal data, enhancing the model's adaptability to distributional changes. In addition, we design a structure-aware feature learning approach that encourages natural clustering of similar patterns in the feature space while maintaining sufficient distinction between different operational states. Extensive experiments on several public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in terms of both accuracy and robustness, showing strong potential for generalization and real-world deployment.

Title: MedLeak: Multimodal Medical Data Leakage in Secure Federated Learning with Crafted Models
Authors: Shanghao Shi, Md Shahedul Haque, Abhijeet Parida, Chaoyu Zhang, Marius George Linguraru, Y.Thomas Hou, Syed Muhammad Anwar, Wenjing Lou
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows participants to collaboratively train machine learning models while keeping their data local, making it ideal for collaborations among healthcare institutions on sensitive data. However, in this paper, we propose a novel privacy attack called MedLeak, which allows a malicious FL server to recover high-quality site-specific private medical data from the client model updates. MedLeak works by introducing an adversarially crafted model during the FL training process. Honest clients, unaware of the insidious changes in the published models, continue to send back their updates as per the standard FL protocol. Leveraging a novel analytical method, MedLeak can efficiently recover private client data from the aggregated parameter updates, eliminating costly optimization. In addition, the scheme relies solely on the aggregated updates, thus rendering secure aggregation protocols ineffective, as they depend on the randomization of intermediate results for security while leaving the final aggregated results unaltered. We implement MedLeak on medical image datasets (MedMNIST, COVIDx CXR-4, and Kaggle Brain Tumor MRI), as well as a medical text dataset (MedAbstract). The results demonstrate that our attack achieves high recovery rates and strong quantitative scores on both image and text datasets. We also thoroughly evaluate MedLeak across different attack parameters, providing insights into key factors that influence attack performance and potential defenses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the recovered data can support downstream tasks such as disease classification with minimal performance loss. Our findings validate the need for enhanced privacy measures in FL systems, particularly for safeguarding sensitive medical data against powerful model inversion attacks.

Title: Generalized Ellipsoids
Authors: Amir Ali Ahmadi, Abraar Chaudhry, Cemil Dibek
Abstract: We introduce a family of symmetric convex bodies called generalized ellipsoids of degree $d$ (GE-$d$s), with ellipsoids corresponding to the case of $d=0$. Generalized ellipsoids (GEs) retain many geometric, algebraic, and algorithmic properties of ellipsoids. We show that the conditions that the parameters of a GE must satisfy can be checked in strongly polynomial time, and that one can search for GEs of a given degree by solving a semidefinite program whose size grows only linearly with dimension. We give an example of a GE which does not have a second-order cone representation, but show that every GE has a semidefinite representation whose size depends linearly on both its dimension and degree. In terms of expressiveness, we prove that for any integer $m\geq 2$, every symmetric full-dimensional polytope with $2m$ facets and every intersection of $m$ co-centered ellipsoids can be represented exactly as a GE-$d$ with $d \leq 2m-3$. Using this result, we show that every symmetric convex body can be approximated arbitrarily well by a GE-$d$ and we quantify the quality of the approximation as a function of the degree $d$. Finally, we present applications of GEs to several areas, such as time-varying portfolio optimization, stability analysis of switched linear systems, robust-to-dynamics optimization, and robust polynomial regression.

Title: METEOR: Melody-aware Texture-controllable Symbolic Orchestral Music Generation via Transformer VAE
Authors: Dinh-Viet-Toan Le, Yi-Hsuan Yang
Abstract: Re-orchestration is the process of adapting a music piece for a different set of instruments. By altering the original instrumentation, the orchestrator often modifies the musical texture while preserving a recognizable melodic line and ensures that each part is playable within the technical and expressive capabilities of the chosen instruments. In this work, we propose METEOR, a model for generating Melody-aware Texture-controllable re-Orchestration with a Transformer-based variational auto-encoder (VAE). This model performs symbolic instrumental and textural music style transfers with a focus on melodic fidelity and controllability. We allow bar- and track-level controllability of the accompaniment with various textural attributes while keeping a homophonic texture. With both subjective and objective evaluations, we show that our model outperforms style transfer models on a re-orchestration task in terms of generation quality and controllability. Moreover, it can be adapted for a lead sheet orchestration task as a zero-shot learning model, achieving performance comparable to a model specifically trained for this task.

Title: NatureLM-audio: an Audio-Language Foundation Model for Bioacoustics
Authors: David Robinson, Marius Miron, Masato Hagiwara, Benno Weck, Sara Keen, Milad Alizadeh, Gagan Narula, Matthieu Geist, Olivier Pietquin
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) prompted with text and audio have achieved state-of-the-art performance across various auditory tasks, including speech, music, and general audio, showing emergent abilities on unseen tasks. However, their potential has yet to be fully demonstrated in bioacoustics tasks, such as detecting animal vocalizations in large recordings, classifying rare and endangered species, and labeling context and behavior -- tasks that are crucial for conservation, biodiversity monitoring, and animal behavior studies. In this work, we present NatureLM-audio, the first audio-language foundation model specifically designed for bioacoustics. Our training dataset consists of carefully curated text-audio pairs spanning bioacoustics, speech, and music, designed to address the field's limited availability of annotated data. We demonstrate successful transfer of learned representations from music and speech to bioacoustics, and our model shows promising generalization to unseen taxa and tasks. We evaluate NatureLM-audio on a novel benchmark (BEANS-Zero) and it sets a new state of the art on several bioacoustics tasks, including zero-shot classification of unseen species. To advance bioacoustics research, we release our model weights, benchmark data, and open-source the code for training and benchmark data generation and model training.

Title: FreeCodec: A disentangled neural speech codec with fewer tokens
Authors: Youqiang Zheng, Weiping Tu, Yueteng Kang, Jie Chen, Yike Zhang, Li Xiao, Yuhong Yang, Long Ma
Abstract: Neural speech codecs have gained great attention for their outstanding reconstruction with discrete token representations. It is a crucial component in generative tasks such as speech coding and large language models (LLM). However, most works based on residual vector quantization perform worse with fewer tokens due to low coding efficiency for modeling complex coupled information. In this paper, we propose a neural speech codec named FreeCodec which employs a more effective encoding framework by decomposing intrinsic properties of speech into different components: 1) a global vector is extracted as the timbre information, 2) a prosody encoder with a long stride level is used to model the prosody information, 3) the content information is from a content encoder. Using different training strategies, FreeCodec achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction and disentanglement scenarios. Results from subjective and objective experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods.

Title: FLOAT: Generative Motion Latent Flow Matching for Audio-driven Talking Portrait
Authors: Taekyung Ki, Dongchan Min, Gyeongsu Chae
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of diffusion-based generative models, portrait image animation has achieved remarkable results. However, it still faces challenges in temporally consistent video generation and fast sampling due to its iterative sampling nature. This paper presents FLOAT, an audio-driven talking portrait video generation method based on flow matching generative model. Instead of a pixel-based latent space, we take advantage of a learned orthogonal motion latent space, enabling efficient generation and editing of temporally consistent motion. To achieve this, we introduce a transformer-based vector field predictor with an effective frame-wise conditioning mechanism. Additionally, our method supports speech-driven emotion enhancement, enabling a natural incorporation of expressive motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art audio-driven talking portrait methods in terms of visual quality, motion fidelity, and efficiency.

Title: Interaction Identification of a Heterogeneous NDS with Quadratic-Bilinear Subsystems
Authors: Tong Zhou, Yubing Li
Abstract: This paper attacks time-domain identification for interaction parameters of a heterogeneous networked dynamic system (NDS), with each of its subsystems being described by a continuous-time descriptor quadratic-bilinear time-invariant (QBTI) model. The obtained results can also be applied to parameter estimations for a lumped QBTI system. No restrictions are put on the sampling rate. Explicit formulas are derived respectively for the transient and steady-state responses of the NDS, provided that the probing signal is generated by a linear time invariant (LTI) system. Some relations have been derived between the NDS steady-state response and its frequency domain input-output mappings. These relations reveal that the value of some NDS associated generalized TFMs can in principle be estimated at almost any interested point of the imaginary axis from time-domain input-output experimental data, as well as its derivatives and a right tangential interpolation along an arbitrary direction. Based on these relations, an estimation algorithm is suggested respectively for the parameters of the NDS and the values of these generalized TFMs. A numerical example is included to illustrate characteristics of the suggested estimation algorithms.

Title: DisCoPatch: Taming Adversarially-driven Batch Statistics for Improved Out-of-Distribution Detection
Authors: Francisco Caetano, Christiaan Viviers, Luis A. Zavala-Mondragón, Peter H. N. de With, Fons van der Sommen
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection holds significant importance across many applications. While semantic and domain-shift OOD problems are well-studied, this work focuses on covariate shifts - subtle variations in the data distribution that can degrade machine learning performance. We hypothesize that detecting these subtle shifts can improve our understanding of in-distribution boundaries, ultimately improving OOD detection. In adversarial discriminators trained with Batch Normalization (BN), real and adversarial samples form distinct domains with unique batch statistics - a property we exploit for OOD detection. We introduce DisCoPatch, an unsupervised Adversarial Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework that harnesses this mechanism. During inference, batches consist of patches from the same image, ensuring a consistent data distribution that allows the model to rely on batch statistics. DisCoPatch uses the VAE's suboptimal outputs (generated and reconstructed) as negative samples to train the discriminator, thereby improving its ability to delineate the boundary between in-distribution samples and covariate shifts. By tightening this boundary, DisCoPatch achieves state-of-the-art results in public OOD detection benchmarks. The proposed model not only excels in detecting covariate shifts, achieving 95.5% AUROC on ImageNet-1K(-C) but also outperforms all prior methods on public Near-OOD (95.0%) benchmarks. With a compact model size of 25MB, it achieves high OOD detection performance at notably lower latency than existing methods, making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world OOD detection applications. The code is publicly available.

Title: Drivetrain simulation using variational autoencoders
Authors: Pallavi Sharma, Jorge-Humberto Urrea-Quintero, Bogdan Bogdan, Adrian-Dumitru Ciotec, Laura Vasilie, Henning Wessels, Matteo Skull
Abstract: This work proposes variational autoencoders (VAEs) to predict a vehicle's jerk signals from torque demand in the context of limited real-world drivetrain datasets. We implement both unconditional and conditional VAEs, trained on experimental data from two variants of a fully electric SUV with differing torque and drivetrain configurations. The VAEs synthesize jerk signals that capture characteristics from multiple drivetrain scenarios by leveraging the learned latent space. A performance comparison with baseline physics-based and hybrid models confirms the effectiveness of the VAEs, without requiring detailed system parametrization. Unconditional VAEs generate realistic jerk signals without prior system knowledge, while conditional VAEs enable the generation of signals tailored to specific torque inputs. This approach reduces the dependence on costly and time-intensive real-world experiments and extensive manual modeling. The results support the integration of generative models such as VAEs into drivetrain simulation pipelines, both for data augmentation and for efficient exploration of complex operational scenarios, with the potential to streamline validation and accelerate vehicle development.

Title: Semantic-Aware Adaptive Video Streaming Using Latent Diffusion Models for Wireless Networks
Authors: Zijiang Yan, Jianhua Pei, Hongda Wu, Hina Tabassum, Ping Wang
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Semantic Communication (SemCom) framework for real-time adaptive-bitrate video streaming by integrating Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) within the FFmpeg techniques. This solution addresses the challenges of high bandwidth usage, storage inefficiencies, and quality of experience (QoE) degradation associated with traditional Constant Bitrate Streaming (CBS) and Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABS). The proposed approach leverages LDMs to compress I-frames into a latent space, offering significant storage and semantic transmission savings without sacrificing high visual quality. While retaining B-frames and P-frames as adjustment metadata to support efficient refinement of video reconstruction at the user side, the proposed framework further incorporates state-of-the-art denoising and Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) techniques. These techniques mitigate semantic ambiguity and restore temporal coherence between frames, even in noisy wireless communication environments. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method achieves high-quality video streaming with optimized bandwidth usage, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in terms of QoE and resource efficiency. This work opens new possibilities for scalable real-time video streaming in 5G and future post-5G networks.

Title: Efficient malicious information detection method based on set partitioning for large-scale Internet of Things
Authors: Yuhan Suo, Runqi Chai, Kaiyuan Chen, Senchun Chai, Wannian Liang, Yuanqing Xia
Abstract: With the large-scale integration of Internet of Things (IoT) into enterprise information management systems, organizations are pursuing digital transformation that hinges on real-time data insights-and yet face escalating security and governance risks. Detecting and responding to threats at scale without impairing system efficiency has therefore become a critical information-management and decision-support challenge for today's executives. This paper develops a distributed, gain-based anomaly-detection framework tailored to IoT-enabled enterprise systems, underpinned by an optimized sensor-subset partitioning strategy. Starting from the perspective of set partitioning strategies, this study analyzes the key factor that contributes to the performance differences between distributed and centralized algorithms. By examining the gain mutual influence of sensor subsets, an optimal set partitioning strategy is designed to minimize inter-subset mutual influence while enhancing intra-subset correlation. To further reduce the computational cost of gain updates, a suboptimal partitioning strategy based on Grassmann distance is proposed, improving the efficiency of selecting suspicious sensors. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that this approach effectively reduces the computational cost of gain updates while maintaining detection performance. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing attack detection performance.

Title: Controlled Invariance in Fully Actuated Max-plus Linear Systems with Precedence Semimodules
Authors: Davide Zorzenon, Jörg Raisch
Abstract: Given a max-plus linear system and a semimodule, the problem of computing the maximal controlled invariant subsemimodule is still open to this day. In this paper, we consider this problem for the specific class of fully actuated systems and constraints in the form of precedence semimodules. The assumption of full actuation corresponds to the existence of an input for each component of the system state. A precedence semimodule is the set of solutions of inequalities typically used to represent time-window constraints. We prove that, in this setting, it is possible to (i) compute the maximal controlled invariant subsemimodule and (ii) decide the convergence of a fixed-point algorithm introduced by R.D. Katz in strongly polynomial time.

Title: Optimal Beamforming for Multi-Target Multi-User ISAC Exploiting Prior Information: How Many Sensing Beams Are Needed?
Authors: Jiayi Yao, Shuowen Zhang
Abstract: This paper studies a multi-target multi-user integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system where a multi-antenna base station (BS) communicates with multiple single-antenna users in the downlink and senses the unknown and random angle information of multiple targets based on their reflected echo signals at the BS receiver as well as their prior probability information. We focus on a general beamforming structure with both communication beams and dedicated sensing beams, whose design is highly non-trivial as more sensing beams provide more flexibility in sensing, but introduce extra interference to communication. To resolve this trade-off, we first characterize the periodic posterior Cramér-Rao bound (PCRB) as a lower bound of the mean-cyclic error (MCE) in multi-target sensing. Then, we optimize the beamforming to minimize the maximum periodic PCRB among all targets to ensure fairness, subject to individual communication rate constraints at multiple users. Despite the non-convexity of this problem, we propose a general construction method for the optimal solution by leveraging semi-definite relaxation (SDR), and derive a general bound on the number of sensing beams needed. Moreover, we unveil specific structures of the optimal solution in various cases, where tighter bounds on the number of sensing beams needed are derived (e.g., no or at most one sensing beam is needed under stringent rate constraints or with homogeneous targets). Next, we study the beamforming optimization to minimize the sum periodic PCRB under user rate constraints. By applying SDR, we propose a general construction method for the optimal solution and its specific structures which yield lower computational complexities. We derive a general bound and various tighter bounds on the number of sensing beams needed. Numerical results validate our analysis and effectiveness of our proposed beamforming designs.

Title: Wi-Fi 6 Cross-Technology Interference Detection and Mitigation by OFDMA: an Experimental Study
Authors: Thijs Havinga, Xianjun Jiao, Wei Liu, Baiheng Chen, Adnan Shahid, Ingrid Moerman
Abstract: Cross-Technology Interference (CTI) poses challenges for the performance and robustness of wireless networks. There are opportunities for better cooperation if the spectral occupation and technology of the interference can be detected. Namely, this information can help the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) scheduler in IEEE 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) to efficiently allocate resources to multiple users inthe frequency domain. This work shows that a single Channel State Information (CSI) snapshot, which is used for packet demodulation in the receiver, is enough to detect and classify the type of CTI on low-cost Wi-Fi 6 hardware. We show the classification accuracy of a small Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for different Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) with simulated data, as well as using a wired and over-the-air test with a professional wireless connectivity tester, while running the inference on the low-cost device. Furthermore, we use openwifi, a full-stack Wi-Fi transceiver running on software-defined radio (SDR) available in the w-iLab.t testbed, as Access Point (AP) to implement a CTI-aware multi-user OFDMA scheduler when the clients send CTI detection feedback to the AP. We show experimentally that it can fully mitigate the 35% throughput loss caused by CTI when the AP applies the appropriate scheduling.

Title: Modular Distributed Nonconvex Learning with Error Feedback
Authors: Guido Carnevale, Nicola Bastianello
Abstract: In this paper, we design a novel distributed learning algorithm using stochastic compressed communications. In detail, we pursue a modular approach, merging ADMM and a gradient-based approach, benefiting from the robustness of the former and the computational efficiency of the latter. Additionally, we integrate a stochastic integral action (error feedback) enabling almost sure rejection of the compression error. We analyze the resulting method in nonconvex scenarios and guarantee almost sure asymptotic convergence to the set of stationary points of the problem. This result is obtained using system-theoretic tools based on stochastic timescale separation. We corroborate our findings with numerical simulations in nonconvex classification.

Authors: Gaya Cocca, Paolo Frasca, Chiara Ravazzi
Abstract: Popularity dynamics in social media depend on a complex interplay of social influence between users and popularity-based recommendations that are provided by the platforms. In this work, we introduce a discrete-time dynamical system to model the evolution of popularity on social media. Our model generalizes the well-known Friedkin-Johnsen model to a set of influencers vying for popularity. We study the asymptotic behavior of this model and illustrate it with numerical examples. Our results highlight the interplay of social influence, past popularity, and content quality in determining the popularity of influencers.

Title: Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks based Video Enhancement
Authors: Kağan Çetin, Hacer Akça, Ömer Nezih Gerek
Abstract: This study introduces an enhanced approach to video super-resolution by extending ordinary Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) structure to handle spatio-temporal data. While SRGAN has proven effective for single-image enhancement, its design does not account for the temporal continuity required in video processing. To address this, a modified framework that incorporates 3D Non-Local Blocks is proposed, which is enabling the model to capture relationships across both spatial and temporal dimensions. An experimental training pipeline is developed, based on patch-wise learning and advanced data degradation techniques, to simulate real-world video conditions and learn from both local and global structures and details. This helps the model generalize better and maintain stability across varying video content while maintaining the general structure besides the pixel-wise correctness. Two model variants-one larger and one more lightweight-are presented to explore the trade-offs between performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate improved temporal coherence, sharper textures, and fewer visual artifacts compared to traditional single-image methods. This work contributes to the development of practical, learning-based solutions for video enhancement tasks, with potential applications in streaming, gaming, and digital restoration.

Title: Spotlight-TTS: Spotlighting the Style via Voiced-Aware Style Extraction and Style Direction Adjustment for Expressive Text-to-Speech
Authors: Nam-Gyu Kim, Deok-Hyeon Cho, Seung-Bin Kim, Seong-Whan Lee
Abstract: Recent advances in expressive text-to-speech (TTS) have introduced diverse methods based on style embedding extracted from reference speech. However, synthesizing high-quality expressive speech remains challenging. We propose Spotlight-TTS, which exclusively emphasizes style via voiced-aware style extraction and style direction adjustment. Voiced-aware style extraction focuses on voiced regions highly related to style while maintaining continuity across different speech regions to improve expressiveness. We adjust the direction of the extracted style for optimal integration into the TTS model, which improves speech quality. Experimental results demonstrate that Spotlight-TTS achieves superior performance compared to baseline models in terms of expressiveness, overall speech quality, and style transfer capability. Our audio samples are publicly available.

Title: Video-Guided Text-to-Music Generation Using Public Domain Movie Collections
Authors: Haven Kim, Zachary Novack, Weihan Xu, Julian McAuley, Hao-Wen Dong
Abstract: Despite recent advancements in music generation systems, their application in film production remains limited, as they struggle to capture the nuances of real-world filmmaking, where filmmakers consider multiple factors-such as visual content, dialogue, and emotional tone-when selecting or composing music for a scene. This limitation primarily stems from the absence of comprehensive datasets that integrate these elements. To address this gap, we introduce Open Screen Soundtrack Library (OSSL), a dataset consisting of movie clips from public domain films, totaling approximately 36.5 hours, paired with high-quality soundtracks and human-annotated mood information. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset in improving the performance of pre-trained models on film music generation tasks, we introduce a new video adapter that enhances an autoregressive transformer-based text-to-music model by adding video-based conditioning. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively enhances MusicGen-Medium in terms of both objective measures of distributional and paired fidelity, and subjective compatibility in mood and genre. To facilitate reproducibility and foster future work, we publicly release the dataset, code, and demo.

Title: Double Entendre: Robust Audio-Based AI-Generated Lyrics Detection via Multi-View Fusion
Authors: Markus Frohmann, Gabriel Meseguer-Brocal, Markus Schedl, Elena V. Epure
Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-based music generation tools is revolutionizing the music industry but also posing challenges to artists, copyright holders, and providers alike. This necessitates reliable methods for detecting such AI-generated content. However, existing detectors, relying on either audio or lyrics, face key practical limitations: audio-based detectors fail to generalize to new or unseen generators and are vulnerable to audio perturbations; lyrics-based methods require cleanly formatted and accurate lyrics, unavailable in practice. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel, practically grounded approach: a multimodal, modular late-fusion pipeline that combines automatically transcribed sung lyrics and speech features capturing lyrics-related information within the audio. By relying on lyrical aspects directly from audio, our method enhances robustness, mitigates susceptibility to low-level artifacts, and enables practical applicability. Experiments show that our method, DE-detect, outperforms existing lyrics-based detectors while also being more robust to audio perturbations. Thus, it offers an effective, robust solution for detecting AI-generated music in real-world scenarios. Our code is available at this https URL.

Abstract: Non-fixed flexible antenna architectures, such as fluid antenna system (FAS), movable antenna (MA), and pinching antenna, have garnered significant interest in recent years. Among them, rotatable antenna (RA) is a promising antenna architecture that exploits additional spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) to enhance the communication performance. To fully obtain the performance gain provided by RAs, accurate channel state information (CSI) is essential for adjusting the orientation/boresight of each antenna. In this letter, we propose an efficient channel estimation scheme for RA communication systems, where the base station (BS) can sequentially and adaptively adjust the orientations of RAs to enrich the environmental observations from diverse angular perspectives, thereby enhancing the channel estimation accuracy. The proposed scheme includes two main procedures that are conducted alternately during each channel training period. Specifically, the first procedure is to estimate the CSI with given RAs' orientations, involving the angle-of-arrivals (AoAs) information and path gains. Then, based on the estimated CSI, the second procedure adjusts the RAs' orientations to maximize the effective channel gain. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed channel estimation method outperforms other benchmark schemes.
