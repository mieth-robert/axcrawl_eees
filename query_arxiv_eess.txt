Title: Scaling and Distilling Transformer Models for sEMG
Authors: Nicholas Mehlman, Jean-Christophe Gagnon-Audet, Michael Shvartsman, Kelvin Niu, Alexander H. Miller, Shagun Sodhani
Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) signals offer a promising avenue for developing innovative human-computer interfaces by providing insights into muscular activity. However, the limited volume of training data and computational constraints during deployment have restricted the investigation of scaling up the model size for solving sEMG tasks. In this paper, we demonstrate that vanilla transformer models can be effectively scaled up on sEMG data and yield improved cross-user performance up to 110M parameters, surpassing the model size regime investigated in other sEMG research (usually <10M parameters). We show that >100M-parameter models can be effectively distilled into models 50x smaller with minimal loss of performance (<1.5% absolute). This results in efficient and expressive models suitable for complex real-time sEMG tasks in real-world environments.

Title: Efficient handover based on Near-field and Far-field RIS for seamless connectivity
Authors: Atiquzzaman Mondal, Waheeb Tashan, Ayat Al-Olaimat, HÃ¼seyin Arslan
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) is becoming a transformative technology for the upcoming 6G communication networks, providing a way for smartly maneuvering the electromagnetic waves to enhance coverage and connectivity. This paper presents an efficient handover (HO) management scheme leveraging RIS in the Fresnel region i.e., in both the near-field (NF) and far-field (FF) regions to reduce signaling overhead and optimize mobility management. For this, we analyzed the signal strength variations in the considered RIS-aided networks, considering the radiative NF and FF regions, and derive the probability density function (PDF) of the RIS-UE distance in the NF region to quantify RIS reflection gains along the user equipment (UE) trajectory. We propose a new HO algorithm incorporating several HO categories like hard handover (HHO), soft handover (SHO), RIS-aided cell breathing (RIS-CB), and RIS-aided ping-pong avoidance (RIS-PP) strategies. The proposed algorithm uses bit error rate (BER) as a key parameter to predict the minimization of unnecessary HOs by using RIS-aided pathways to retain connectivity with the serving base station (BS), which minimizes the requirement for frequent target BS searching and ultimately optimizes the HO. By restricting measurement reports and HO requests, the suggested method improves spectrum efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE), especially in crowded cellular networks. Numerical results highlight significant reductions in HO rates and signaling load, ensuring seamless connectivity and improved quality of service (QoS) in 6G systems.

Title: Tiny Noise-Robust Voice Activity Detector for Voice Assistants
Authors: Hamed Jafarzadeh Asl, Mahsa Ghazvini Nejad, Amin Edraki, Masoud Asgharian, Vahid Partovi Nia
Abstract: Voice Activity Detection (VAD) in the presence of background noise remains a challenging problem in speech processing. Accurate VAD is essential in automatic speech recognition, voice-to-text, conversational agents, etc, where noise can severely degrade the performance. A modern application includes the voice assistant, specially mounted on Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) devices such as cell phones, smart glasses, earbuds, etc, where the voice signal includes background noise. Therefore, VAD modules must remain light-weight due to their practical on-device limitation. The existing models often struggle with low signal-to-noise ratios across diverse acoustic environments. A simple VAD often detects human voice in a clean environment, but struggles to detect the human voice in noisy conditions. We propose a noise-robust VAD that comprises a light-weight VAD, with data pre-processing and post-processing added modules to handle the background noise. This approach significantly enhances the VAD accuracy in noisy environments and requires neither a larger model, nor fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a notable improvement compared to baselines, particularly in environments with high background noise interference. This modified VAD additionally improving clean speech detection.

Title: Toward Trusted Onboard AI: Advancing Small Satellite Operations using Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Cannon Whitney, Joseph Melville
Abstract: A RL (Reinforcement Learning) algorithm was developed for command automation onboard a 3U CubeSat. This effort focused on the implementation of macro control action RL, a technique in which an onboard agent is provided with compiled information based on live telemetry as its observation. The agent uses this information to produce high-level actions, such as adjusting attitude to solar pointing, which are then translated into control algorithms and executed through lower-level instructions. Once trust in the onboard agent is established, real-time environmental information can be leveraged for faster response times and reduced reliance on ground control. The approach not only focuses on developing an RL algorithm for a specific satellite but also sets a precedent for integrating trusted AI into onboard systems. This research builds on previous work in three areas: (1) RL algorithms for issuing high-level commands that are translated into low-level executable instructions; (2) the deployment of AI inference models interfaced with live operational systems, particularly onboard spacecraft; and (3) strategies for building trust in AI systems, especially for remote and autonomous applications. Existing RL research for satellite control is largely limited to simulation-based experiments; in this work, these techniques are tailored by constructing a digital twin of a specific spacecraft and training the RL agent to issue macro actions in this simulated environment. The policy of the trained agent is copied to an isolated environment, where it is fed compiled information about the satellite to make inference predictions, thereby demonstrating the RL algorithm's validity on orbit without granting it command authority. This process enables safe comparison of the algorithm's predictions against actual satellite behavior and ensures operation within expected parameters.

Title: Optimal Planning for Enhancing the Resilience of Modern Distribution Systems Against Cyberattacks
Authors: Armita Khashayardoost, Ahmad Mohammad Saber, Deepa Kundur
Abstract: The increasing integration of IoT-connected devices in smart grids has introduced new vulnerabilities at the distribution level. Of particular concern is the potential for cyberattacks that exploit high-wattage IoT devices, such as EV chargers, to manipulate local demand and destabilize the grid. While previous studies have primarily focused on such attacks at the transmission level, this paper investigates their feasibility and impact at the distribution level. We examine how cyberattackers can target voltage-sensitive nodes, especially those exposed by the presence of high-consumption devices, to cause voltage deviation and service disruption. Our analysis demonstrates that conventional grid protections are insufficient against these intelligent, localized attacks. To address this, we propose resilience strategies using distributed generation (DGs), exploring their role in preemptive planning. This research highlights the urgent need for distribution-level cyber resilience planning in smart grids.

Title: Safe and Efficient Data-driven Connected Cruise Control
Authors: Haosong Xiao, Chaozhe R. He
Abstract: In this paper, we design a safe and efficient cruise control for the connected automated vehicle with access to motion information from multiple vehicles ahead via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. Position and velocity data collected from a chain of human-driven vehicles are systematically leveraged to design a connected cruise controller that smoothly responds to traffic perturbations while maximizing energy efficiency. A safety filter derived from a control barrier function provides the safety guarantee. We investigate the proposed control design's energy performance against real traffic datasets and quantify the safety filter's energy impact. It is shown that optimally utilizing V2V connectivity reduces energy consumption by more than 10\% compared to standard non-connected adaptive cruise control. Meanwhile, interesting interplays between safety filter and energy efficiency design are highlighted, revealing future research directions.

Title: Deep Learning for Gradient and BCG Artifacts Removal in EEG During Simultaneous fMRI
Authors: K. A. Shahriar, E. H. Bhuiyan, Q. Luo, M. E. H. Chowdhury, X. J. Zhou
Abstract: Simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording combines high temporal and spatial resolution for tracking neural activity. However, its usefulness is greatly limited by artifacts from magnetic resonance (MR), especially gradient artifacts (GA) and ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts, which interfere with the EEG signal. To address this issue, we used a denoising autoencoder (DAR), a deep learning framework designed to reduce MR-related artifacts in EEG recordings. Using paired data that includes both artifact-contaminated and MR-corrected EEG from the CWL EEG-fMRI dataset, DAR uses a 1D convolutional autoencoder to learn a direct mapping from noisy to clear signal segments. Compared to traditional artifact removal methods like principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), average artifact subtraction (AAS), and wavelet thresholding, DAR shows better performance. It achieves a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 0.0218 $\pm$ 0.0152, a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.8885 $\pm$ 0.0913, and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of 14.63 dB. Statistical analysis with paired t-tests confirms that these improvements are significant (p<0.001; Cohen's d>1.2). A leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation protocol shows that the model generalizes well, yielding an average RMSE of 0.0635 $\pm$ 0.0110 and an SSIM of 0.6658 $\pm$ 0.0880 across unseen subjects. Additionally, saliency-based visualizations demonstrate that DAR highlights areas with dense artifacts, which makes its decisions easier to interpret. Overall, these results position DAR as a potential and understandable solution for real-time EEG artifact removal in simultaneous EEG-fMRI applications.

Title: Design and Experimental Validation of UAV Swarm-Based Phased Arrays with MagSafe- and LEGO-Inspired RF Connectors
Authors: Bidya Debnath, Mst Mostary Begum, Prashant Neupant, Brooke E. Molen, Junming Diao
Abstract: This paper presents a novel UAV swarm-based phased array antenna system that leverages MagSafe- and LEGO-inspired radio frequency (RF) connectors to address key challenges in distributed phased arrays, including inter-element oscillator synchronization, localization, phase coherence, and positional accuracy. The proposed non-threaded, hands-free connectors enable precise inter-element spacing and establish a continuous, low-loss RF signal propagation path during mid-flight docking. A multi-stage optimization of the RF connector achieves a compact form factor, DC-to-RF bandwidth, and a measured insertion loss as low as 0.2\,dB. The system architecture offers scalability in gain and frequency by adjusting the array element density per UAV and UAV dimensions. Experimental results from both stationary and in-flight tests of two UAV-based phased array prototypes align closely with simulations, demonstrating robust beam steering to multiple directions. This work delivers a practical, scalable, and low-complexity platform that enables rapid deployment for next-generation airborne communications, radar, and remote sensing applications.

Title: A Segmentation Framework for Accurate Diagnosis of Amyloid Positivity without Structural Images
Authors: Penghan Zhu, Shurui Mei, Shushan Chen, Xiaobo Chu, Shanbo He, Ziyi Liu
Abstract: This study proposes a deep learning-based framework for automated segmentation of brain regions and classification of amyloid positivity using positron emission tomography (PET) images alone, without the need for structural MRI or CT. A 3D U-Net architecture with four layers of depth was trained and validated on a dataset of 200 F18-florbetapir amyloid-PET scans, with an 130/20/50 train/validation/test split. Segmentation performance was evaluated using Dice similarity coefficients across 30 brain regions, with scores ranging from 0.45 to 0.88, demonstrating high anatomical accuracy, particularly in subcortical structures. Quantitative fidelity of PET uptake within clinically relevant regions. Precuneus, prefrontal cortex, gyrus rectus, and lateral temporal cortex was assessed using normalized root mean square error, achieving values as low as 0.0011. Furthermore, the model achieved a classification accuracy of 0.98 for amyloid positivity based on regional uptake quantification, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.99. These results highlight the model's potential for integration into PET only diagnostic pipelines, particularly in settings where structural imaging is not available. This approach reduces dependence on coregistration and manual delineation, enabling scalable, reliable, and reproducible analysis in clinical and research applications. Future work will focus on clinical validation and extension to diverse PET tracers including C11 PiB and other F18 labeled compounds.

Title: Robust Filtering and Learning in State-Space Models: Skewness and Heavy Tails Via Asymmetric Laplace Distribution
Authors: Yifan Yu, Shengjie Xiu, Daniel P. Palomar
Abstract: State-space models are pivotal for dynamic system analysis but often struggle with outlier data that deviates from Gaussian distributions, frequently exhibiting skewness and heavy tails. This paper introduces a robust extension utilizing the asymmetric Laplace distribution, specifically tailored to capture these complex characteristics. We propose an efficient variational Bayes algorithm and a novel single-loop parameter estimation strategy, significantly enhancing the efficiency of the filtering, smoothing, and parameter estimation processes. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our methods provide consistently robust performance across various noise settings without the need for manual hyperparameter adjustments. In stark contrast, existing models generally rely on specific noise conditions and necessitate extensive manual tuning. Moreover, our approach uses far fewer computational resources, thereby validating the model's effectiveness and underscoring its potential for practical applications in fields such as robust control and financial modeling.

Title: Whole-brain Transferable Representations from Large-Scale fMRI Data Improve Task-Evoked Brain Activity Decoding
Authors: Yueh-Po Peng, Vincent K.M. Cheung, Li Su
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in neuroscience is to decode mental states from brain activity. While functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers a non-invasive approach to capture brain-wide neural dynamics with high spatial precision, decoding from fMRI data -- particularly from task-evoked activity -- remains challenging due to its high dimensionality, low signal-to-noise ratio, and limited within-subject data. Here, we leverage recent advances in computer vision and propose STDA-SwiFT, a transformer-based model that learns transferable representations from large-scale fMRI datasets via spatial-temporal divided attention and self-supervised contrastive learning. Using pretrained voxel-wise representations from 995 subjects in the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we show that our model substantially improves downstream decoding performance of task-evoked activity across multiple sensory and cognitive domains, even with minimal data preprocessing. We demonstrate performance gains from larger receptor fields afforded by our memory-efficient attention mechanism, as well as the impact of functional relevance in pretraining data when fine-tuning on small samples. Our work showcases transfer learning as a viable approach to harness large-scale datasets to overcome challenges in decoding brain activity from fMRI data.

Title: Green One-Bit Quantized Precoding in Cell-Free Massive MIMO
Authors: Salih GÃ¼mÃ¼sbuÄa, Ozan Alp Topal, Ãzlem TuÄfe Demir
Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) is expected to be one of the key technologies in sixth-generation (6G) and beyond wireless communications, offering enhanced spectral efficiency for cell-edge user equipments by employing joint transmission and reception with a large number of antennas distributed throughout the region. However, high-resolution RF chains associated with these antennas significantly increase power consumption. To address this issue, the use of low-resolution analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters (ADCs/DACs) has emerged as a promising approach to balance power efficiency and performance in massive MIMO networks. In this work, we propose a novel quantized precoding algorithm tailored for cell-free massive MIMO systems, where the proposed method dynamically deactivates unnecessary antennas based on the structure of each symbol vector, thereby enhancing energy efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing methods such as squared-infinity norm Douglas-Rachford splitting (SQUID) and regularized zero forcing (RZF), achieving superior performance while effectively reducing power consumption.

Title: Towards Blind Bitstream-corrupted Video Recovery via a Visual Foundation Model-driven Framework
Authors: Tianyi Liu, Kejun Wu, Chen Cai, Yi Wang, Kim-Hui Yap, Lap-Pui Chau
Abstract: Video signals are vulnerable in multimedia communication and storage systems, as even slight bitstream-domain corruption can lead to significant pixel-domain degradation. To recover faithful spatio-temporal content from corrupted inputs, bitstream-corrupted video recovery has recently emerged as a challenging and understudied task. However, existing methods require time-consuming and labor-intensive annotation of corrupted regions for each corrupted video frame, resulting in a large workload in practice. In addition, high-quality recovery remains difficult as part of the local residual information in corrupted frames may mislead feature completion and successive content recovery. In this paper, we propose the first blind bitstream-corrupted video recovery framework that integrates visual foundation models with a recovery model, which is adapted to different types of corruption and bitstream-level prompts. Within the framework, the proposed Detect Any Corruption (DAC) model leverages the rich priors of the visual foundation model while incorporating bitstream and corruption knowledge to enhance corruption localization and blind recovery. Additionally, we introduce a novel Corruption-aware Feature Completion (CFC) module, which adaptively processes residual contributions based on high-level corruption understanding. With VFM-guided hierarchical feature augmentation and high-level coordination in a mixture-of-residual-experts (MoRE) structure, our method suppresses artifacts and enhances informative residuals. Comprehensive evaluations show that the proposed method achieves outstanding performance in bitstream-corrupted video recovery without requiring a manually labeled mask sequence. The demonstrated effectiveness will help to realize improved user experience, wider application scenarios, and more reliable multimedia communication and storage systems.

Title: Assessing Value of Renewable-based VPP Versus Electrical Storage: Multi-market Participation Under Different Scheduling Regimes and Uncertainties
Authors: Hadi Nemati, Ignacio Egido, Pedro SÃ¡nchez-MartÃ­n, Ãlvaro Ortega
Abstract: This paper compares the participation of Renewable-only Virtual Power Plants (RVPPs) and grid-scale Electrical Storage Systems (ESSs) in energy and reserve markets, evaluating their technical performance, market strategies, and economic outcomes. To ensure a fair comparison, scheduling is analyzed over representative sample days that capture seasonal operating regimes, and the associated uncertainties are explicitly modeled. Two-stage robust optimization frameworks are employed: the RVPP model addresses price, generation, and demand uncertainties, whereas the ESS model considers price uncertainty only. In addition, an algorithm is proposed for sizing the ESS so that its market performance matches that of the RVPP. Simulations cover both favorable and unfavorable scenarios, reflecting seasonal energy limits for dispatchable resources, varying forecast errors for nondispatchable resources, and alternative uncertainty-management strategies. The results provide operators with quantitative guidance on the relative value of each approach.

Title: PINN and GNN-based RF Map Construction for Wireless Communication Systems
Authors: Lizhou Liu, Xiaohui Chen, Zihan Tang, Mengyao Ma, Wenyi Zhang
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) map is a promising technique for capturing the characteristics of multipath signal propagation, offering critical support for channel modeling, coverage analysis, and beamforming in wireless communication networks. This paper proposes a novel RF map construction method based on a combination of physics-informed neural network (PINN) and graph neural network (GNN). The PINN incorporates physical constraints derived from electromagnetic propagation laws to guide the learning process, while the GNN models spatial correlations among receiver locations. By parameterizing multipath signals into received power, delay, and angle of arrival (AoA), and integrating both physical priors and spatial dependencies, the proposed method achieves accurate prediction of multipath parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that the method enables high-precision RF map construction under sparse sampling conditions and delivers robust performance in both indoor and complex outdoor environments, outperforming baseline methods in terms of generalization and accuracy.

Title: Learned Off-aperture Encoding for Wide Field-of-view RGBD Imaging
Authors: Haoyu Wei, Xin Liu, Yuhui Liu, Qiang Fu, Wolfgang Heidrich, Edmund Y. Lam, Yifan Peng
Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) designed imaging systems integrate coded optical designs with decoding algorithms to enhance imaging fidelity for diverse visual tasks. However, existing E2E designs encounter significant challenges in maintaining high image fidelity at wide fields of view, due to high computational complexity, as well as difficulties in modeling off-axis wave propagation while accounting for off-axis aberrations. In particular, the common approach of placing the encoding element into the aperture or pupil plane results in only a global control of the wavefront. To overcome these limitations, this work explores an additional design choice by positioning a DOE off-aperture, enabling a spatial unmixing of the degrees of freedom and providing local control over the wavefront over the image plane. Our approach further leverages hybrid refractive-diffractive optical systems by linking differentiable ray and wave optics modeling, thereby optimizing depth imaging quality and demonstrating system versatility. Experimental results reveal that the off-aperture DOE enhances the imaging quality by over 5 dB in PSNR at a FoV of approximately $45^\circ$ when paired with a simple thin lens, outperforming traditional on-aperture systems. Furthermore, we successfully recover color and depth information at nearly $28^\circ$ FoV using off-aperture DOE configurations with compound optics. Physical prototypes for both applications validate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed method.

Title: The Risks and Detection of Overestimated Privacy Protection in Voice Anonymisation
Authors: Michele Panariello, Sarina Meyer, Pierre Champion, Xiaoxiao Miao, Massimiliano Todisco, Ngoc Thang Vu, Nicholas Evans
Abstract: Voice anonymisation aims to conceal the voice identity of speakers in speech recordings. Privacy protection is usually estimated from the difficulty of using a speaker verification system to re-identify the speaker post-anonymisation. Performance assessments are therefore dependent on the verification model as well as the anonymisation system. There is hence potential for privacy protection to be overestimated when the verification system is poorly trained, perhaps with mismatched data. In this paper, we demonstrate the insidious risk of overestimating anonymisation performance and show examples of exaggerated performance reported in the literature. For the worst case we identified, performance is overestimated by 74% relative. We then introduce a means to detect when performance assessment might be untrustworthy and show that it can identify all overestimation scenarios presented in the paper. Our solution is openly available as a fork of the 2024 VoicePrivacy Challenge evaluation toolkit.

Title: Exploration of Low-Cost but Accurate Radar-Based Human Motion Direction Determination
Authors: Weicheng Gao
Abstract: This work is completed on a whim after discussions with my junior colleague. The motion direction angle affects the micro-Doppler spectrum width, thus determining the human motion direction can provide important prior information for downstream tasks such as gait recognition. However, Doppler-Time map (DTM)-based methods still have room for improvement in achieving feature augmentation and motion determination simultaneously. In response, a low-cost but accurate radar-based human motion direction determination (HMDD) method is explored in this paper. In detail, the radar-based human gait DTMs are first generated, and then the feature augmentation is achieved using feature linking model. Subsequently, the HMDD is implemented through a lightweight and fast Vision Transformer-Convolutional Neural Network hybrid model structure. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through open-source dataset. The open-source code of this work is released at: this https URL.

Title: Fundamental Limits of Rigid Body Localization
Authors: Niclas FÃ¼hrling, Ivan Alexander Morales Sandoval, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, Gonzalo Seco-Granados, David GonzÃ¡lez G., Osvaldo Gonsa
Abstract: We consider a novel approach to formulate the CramÃ©r-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for the rigid body localization (RBL) problem, which allows us to assess the fundamental accuracy limits on the estimation of the translation and rotation of a rigid body with respect to a known reference. To that end, we adopt an information-centric construction of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), which allows to capture the contribution of each measurement towards the FIM, both in terms of input measurement types, as well as of their error distributions. Taking advantage of this approach, we derive a generic framework for the CRLB formulation, which is applicable to any type of rigid body localization scenario, extending the conventional FIM formulation suitable for point targets to the case of a rigid body whose location include both translation vector and the rotation matrix (or alternative the rotation angles), with respect to a reference. Closed-form expressions for all CRLBs are given, including the bound incorporating an orthonormality constraint onto the rotation matrix. Numerical results illustrate that the derived expression correctly lower-bounds the errors of estimated localization parameters obtained via various related state-of-the-art (SotA) estimators, revealing their accuracies and suggesting that SotA RBL algorithms can still be improved.

Title: Modeling Multi-Level Hearing Loss for Speech Intelligibility Prediction
Authors: Xiajie Zhou, Candy Olivia Mawalim, Masashi Unoki
Abstract: The diverse perceptual consequences of hearing loss severely impede speech communication, but standard clinical audiometry, which is focused on threshold-based frequency sensitivity, does not adequately capture deficits in frequency and temporal resolution. To address this limitation, we propose a speech intelligibility prediction method that explicitly simulates auditory degradations according to hearing loss severity by broadening cochlear filters and applying low-pass modulation filtering to temporal envelopes. Speech signals are subsequently analyzed using the spectro-temporal modulation (STM) representations, which reflect how auditory resolution loss alters the underlying modulation structure. In addition, normalized cross-correlation (NCC) matrices quantify the similarity between the STM representations of clean speech and speech in noise. These auditory-informed features are utilized to train a Vision Transformer-based regression model that integrates the STM maps and NCC embeddings to estimate speech intelligibility scores. Evaluations on the Clarity Prediction Challenge corpus show that the proposed method outperforms the Hearing-Aid Speech Perception Index v2 (HASPI v2) in both mild and moderate-to-severe hearing loss groups, with a relative root mean squared error reduction of 16.5% for the mild group and a 6.1% reduction for the moderate-to-severe group. These results highlight the importance of explicitly modeling listener-specific frequency and temporal resolution degradations to improve speech intelligibility prediction and provide interpretability in auditory distortions.

Title: A k-space approach to modeling multi-channel parametric array loudspeaker systems
Authors: Tao Zhuang, Longbiao He, Feng Niu, Jia-Xin Zhong, Jing Lu
Abstract: Multi-channel parametric array loudspeaker (MCPAL) systems offer enhanced flexibility and promise for generating highly directional audio beams in real-world applications. However, efficient and accurate prediction of their generated sound fields remains a major challenge due to the complex nonlinear behavior and multi-channel signal processing involved. To overcome this obstacle, we propose a k-space approach for modeling arbitrary MCPAL systems arranged on a baffled planar surface. In our method, the linear ultrasound field is first solved using the angular spectrum approach, and the quasilinear audio sound field is subsequently computed efficiently in k-space. By leveraging three-dimensional fast Fourier transforms, our approach not only achieves high computational and memory efficiency but also maintains accuracy without relying on the paraxial approximation. For typical configurations studied, the proposed method demonstrates a speed-up of more than four orders of magnitude compared to the direct integration method. Our proposed approach paved the way for simulating and designing advanced MCPAL systems.

Title: trAIce3D: A Prompt-Driven Transformer Based U-Net for Semantic Segmentation of Microglial Cells from Large-Scale 3D Microscopy Images
Authors: MohammadAmin Alamalhoda, Arsalan Firoozi, Alessandro Venturino, Sandra Siegert
Abstract: The shape of a cell contains essential information about its function within the biological system. Segmenting these structures from large-scale 3D microscopy images is challenging, limiting clinical insights especially for microglia, immune-associated cells involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Existing segmentation methods mainly focus on cell bodies, struggle with overlapping structures, perform poorly on noisy images, require hyperparameter tuning for each new dataset, or rely on tedious semi-automated approaches. We introduce trAIce3D, a deep-learning architecture designed for precise microglia segmentation, capturing both somas and branches. It employs a two-stage approach: first, a 3D U-Net with vision transformers in the encoder detects somas using a sliding-window technique to cover the entire image. Then, the same architecture, enhanced with cross-attention blocks in skip connections, refines each soma and its branches by using soma coordinates as a prompt and a 3D window around the target cell as input. Training occurs in two phases: self-supervised Soma Segmentation, followed by prompt-based Branch Segmentation, leveraging pre-trained weights from the first phase. Trained and evaluated on a dataset of 41,230 microglial cells, trAIce3D significantly improves segmentation accuracy and generalization, enabling scalable analysis of complex cellular morphologies. While optimized for microglia, its architecture can extend to other intricate cell types, such as neurons and astrocytes, broadening its impact on neurobiological research.

Title: Safe Deployment of Offline Reinforcement Learning via Input Convex Action Correction
Authors: Alex Durkin, Jasper Stolte, Matthew Jones, Raghuraman Pitchumani, Bei Li, Christian Michler, Mehmet MercangÃ¶z
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) offers a promising framework for developing control strategies in chemical process systems using historical data, without the risks or costs of online experimentation. This work investigates the application of offline RL to the safe and efficient control of an exothermic polymerisation continuous stirred-tank reactor. We introduce a Gymnasium-compatible simulation environment that captures the reactor's nonlinear dynamics, including reaction kinetics, energy balances, and operational constraints. The environment supports three industrially relevant scenarios: startup, grade change down, and grade change up. It also includes reproducible offline datasets generated from proportional-integral controllers with randomised tunings, providing a benchmark for evaluating offline RL algorithms in realistic process control tasks. We assess behaviour cloning and implicit Q-learning as baseline algorithms, highlighting the challenges offline agents face, including steady-state offsets and degraded performance near setpoints. To address these issues, we propose a novel deployment-time safety layer that performs gradient-based action correction using input convex neural networks (PICNNs) as learned cost models. The PICNN enables real-time, differentiable correction of policy actions by descending a convex, state-conditioned cost surface, without requiring retraining or environment interaction. Experimental results show that offline RL, particularly when combined with convex action correction, can outperform traditional control approaches and maintain stability across all scenarios. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of integrating offline RL with interpretable and safety-aware corrections for high-stakes chemical process control, and lay the groundwork for more reliable data-driven automation in industrial systems.

Title: Distributed Average Consensus in Wireless Multi-Agent Systems with Over-the-Air Aggregation
Authors: Themistoklis Charalambous, Zheng Chen, Christoforos N. Hadjicostis
Abstract: In this paper, we address the average consensus problem of multi-agent systems over wireless networks. We propose a distributed average consensus algorithm by invoking the concept of over-the-air aggregation, which exploits the signal superposition property of wireless multiple-access channels. The proposed algorithm deploys a modified version of the well-known Ratio Consensus algorithm with an additional normalization step for compensating for the arbitrary channel coefficients. We show that, when the noise level at the receivers is negligible, the algorithm converges asymptotically to the average for time-invariant and time-varying channels. Numerical simulations corroborate the validity of our results.

Title: A Multi-Scale Spatial Attention Network for Near-field MIMO Channel Estimation
Authors: Zhiming Zhu, Shu Xu, Jiexin Zhang, Chunguo Li, Yongming Huang, Luxi Yang
Abstract: The deployment of extremely large-scale array (ELAA) brings higher spectral efficiency and spatial degree of freedom, but triggers issues on near-field channel estimation. Existing near-field channel estimation schemes primarily exploit sparsity in the transform domain. However, these schemes are sensitive to the transform matrix selection and the stopping criteria. Inspired by the success of deep learning (DL) in far-field channel estimation, this paper proposes a novel spatial-attention-based method for reconstructing extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) channel. Initially, the spatial antenna correlations of near-field channels are analyzed as an expectation over the angle-distance space, which demonstrate correlation range of an antenna element varies with its position. Due to the strong correlation between adjacent antenna elements, interactions of inter-subchannel are applied to describe inherent correlation of near-field channels instead of inter-element. Subsequently, a multi-scale spatial attention network (MsSAN) with the inter-subchannel correlation learning capabilities is proposed tailed to near-field MIMO channel estimation. We employ the multi-scale architecture to refine the subchannel size in MsSAN. Specially, we inventively introduce the sum of dot products as spatial attention (SA) instead of cross-covariance to weight subchannel features at different scales in the SA module. Simulation results are presented to validate the proposed MsSAN achieves remarkable the inter-subchannel correlation learning capabilities and outperforms others in terms of near-field channel reconstruction.

Title: A Dual-Feature Extractor Framework for Accurate Back Depth and Spine Morphology Estimation from Monocular RGB Images
Authors: Yuxin Wei, Yue Zhang, Moxin Zhao, Chang Shi, Jason P.Y. Cheung, Teng Zhang, Nan Meng
Abstract: Scoliosis is a prevalent condition that impacts both physical health and appearance, with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) being the most common form. Currently, the main AIS assessment tool, X-rays, poses significant limitations, including radiation exposure and limited accessibility in poor and remote areas. To address this problem, the current solutions are using RGB images to analyze spine morphology. However, RGB images are highly susceptible to environmental factors, such as lighting conditions, compromising model stability and generalizability. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel pipeline to accurately estimate the depth information of the unclothed back, compensating for the limitations of 2D information, and then estimate spine morphology by integrating both depth and surface information. To capture the subtle depth variations of the back surface with precision, we design an adaptive multiscale feature learning network named Grid-Aware Multiscale Adaptive Network (GAMA-Net). This model uses dual encoders to extract both patch-level and global features, which are then interacted by the Patch-Based Hybrid Attention (PBHA) module. The Adaptive Multiscale Feature Fusion (AMFF) module is used to dynamically fuse information in the decoder. As a result, our depth estimation model achieves remarkable accuracy across three different evaluation metrics, with scores of nearly 78.2%, 93.6%, and 97.5%, respectively. To further validate the effectiveness of the predicted depth, we integrate both surface and depth information for spine morphology estimation. This integrated approach enhances the accuracy of spine curve generation, achieving an impressive performance of up to 97%.

Title: Malleability-Resistant Encrypted Control System with Disturbance Compensation and Real-Time Attack Detection
Authors: Naoki Aizawa, Keita Emura, Kiminao Kogiso
Abstract: This study proposes an encrypted PID control system with a disturbance observer (DOB) using a keyed-homomorphic encryption (KHE) scheme, aiming to achieve control performance while providing resistance to malleability-based attacks. The controller integrates a DOB with a PID structure to compensate for modeling uncertainties by estimating and canceling external disturbances. To enhance security, the system is designed to output error symbols when ciphertexts are falsified during decryption or evaluation, enabling real-time detection of malleability-based signal or parameter falsification. To validate the proposed method, we conduct stage positioning control experiments and attack detection tests using an industrial linear stage. The results show that the encrypted DOB-based PID controller outperforms a conventional encrypted PID controller in terms of tracking accuracy. Furthermore, the system successfully detects two types of malleability-based attacks: one that destabilizes the control system, and another that degrades its performance. The primary contributions of this study are: (i) the implementation of a KHE-based encrypted DOB-PID controller, (ii) the improvement of control performance under uncertainties, and (iii) the experimental demonstration of attack detection capabilities in encrypted control systems.

Title: Compressive Near-Field Wideband Channel Estimation for THz Extremely Large-scale MIMO Systems
Authors: Jionghui Wang, Hongwei Wang, Jun Fang, Lingxiang Li, Zhi Chen
Abstract: We consider the channel acquisition problem for a wideband terahertz (THz) communication system, where an extremely large-scale array is deployed to mitigate severe path attenuation. In channel modeling, we account for both the near-field spherical wavefront and the wideband beam-splitting phenomena, resulting in a wideband near-field channel. We propose a frequency-independent orthogonal dictionary that generalizes the standard discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix by introducing an additional parameter to capture the near-field property. This dictionary enables the wideband near-field channel to be efficiently represented with a two-dimensional (2D) block-sparse structure. Leveraging this specific sparse structure, the wideband near-field channel estimation problem can be effectively addressed within a customized compressive sensing framework. Numerical results demonstrate the significant advantages of our proposed 2D block-sparsity-aware method over conventional polar-domain-based approaches for near-field wideband channel estimation.

Title: Foundations for Energy-Aware Zero-Energy Devices: From Energy Sensing to Adaptive Protocols
Authors: Onel L. A. LÃ³pez, Mateen Ashraf, Samer Nasser, Gabriel M. de Jesus, Ritesh Kumar Singh, Miltiadis C. Filippou, Jeroen Famaey
Abstract: Zero-energy devices (ZEDs) are key enablers of sustainable Internet of Things networks by operating solely on harvested ambient energy. Their limited and dynamic energy budget calls for protocols that are energy-aware and intelligently adaptive. However, designing effective energy-aware protocols for ZEDs requires theoretical models that realistically reflect device constraints. Indeed, existing approaches often oversimplify key aspects such as energy information (EI) acquisition, task-level variability, and energy storage dynamics, limiting their practical relevance and transferability. This article addresses this gap by offering a structured overview of the key modeling components, trade-offs, and limitations involved in energy-aware ZED protocol design. For this, we dissect EI acquisition methods and costs, characterize core operational tasks, analyze energy usage models and storage constraints, and review representative protocol strategies. Moreover, we offer design insights and guidelines on how ZED operation protocols can leverage EI, often illustrated through selected in-house examples. Finally, we outline key research directions to inspire more efficient and scalable protocol solutions for future ZEDs.

Title: Of Good Demons and Bad Angels: Guaranteeing Safe Control under Finite Precision
Authors: Samuel Teuber, Debasmita Lohar, Bernhard Beckert
Abstract: As neural networks (NNs) become increasingly prevalent in safety-critical neural network-controlled cyber-physical systems (NNCSs), formally guaranteeing their safety becomes crucial. For these systems, safety must be ensured throughout their entire operation, necessitating infinite-time horizon verification. To verify the infinite-time horizon safety of NNCSs, recent approaches leverage Differential Dynamic Logic (dL). However, these dL-based guarantees rely on idealized, real-valued NN semantics and fail to account for roundoff errors introduced by finite-precision implementations. This paper bridges the gap between theoretical guarantees and real-world implementations by incorporating robustness under finite-precision perturbations -- in sensing, actuation, and computation -- into the safety verification. We model the problem as a hybrid game between a good Demon, responsible for control actions, and a bad Angel, introducing perturbations. This formulation enables formal proofs of robustness w.r.t. a given (bounded) perturbation. Leveraging this bound, we employ state-of-the-art mixed-precision fixed-point tuners to synthesize sound and efficient implementations, thus providing a complete end-to-end solution. We evaluate our approach on case studies from the automotive and aeronautics domains, producing efficient NN implementations with rigorous infinite-time horizon safety guarantees.

Title: Cluster Synchronization and Phase Cohesiveness of Kuramoto Oscillators via Mean-phase Feedback Control and Pacemakers
Authors: Ryota Kokubo, Rui Kato, Hideaki Ishii
Abstract: Brain networks typically exhibit characteristic synchronization patterns where several synchronized clusters coexist. On the other hand, neurological disorders are considered to be related to pathological synchronization such as excessive synchronization of large populations of neurons. Motivated by these phenomena, this paper presents two approaches to control the cluster synchronization and the cluster phase cohesiveness of Kuramoto oscillators. One is based on feeding back the mean phases to the clusters, and the other is based on the use of pacemakers. First, we show conditions on the feedback gains and the pacemaker weights for the network to achieve cluster synchronization. Then, we propose a method to find optimal feedback gains through convex optimization. Second, we show conditions on the feedback gains and the pacemaker weights for the network to achieve cluster phase cohesiveness. A numerical example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Title: Optimizing Federated Learning Configurations for MRI Prostate Segmentation and Cancer Detection: A Simulation Study
Authors: Ashkan Moradi, Fadila Zerka, Joeran S. Bosma, Mohammed R. S. Sunoqrot, Bendik S. Abrahamsen, Derya Yakar, Jeroen Geerdink, Henkjan Huisman, Tone Frost Bathen, Mattijs Elschot
Abstract: Purpose: To develop and optimize a federated learning (FL) framework across multiple clients for biparametric MRI prostate segmentation and clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) detection. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was conducted using Flower FL to train a nnU-Net-based architecture for MRI prostate segmentation and csPCa detection, using data collected from January 2010 to August 2021. Model development included training and optimizing local epochs, federated rounds, and aggregation strategies for FL-based prostate segmentation on T2-weighted MRIs (four clients, 1294 patients) and csPCa detection using biparametric MRIs (three clients, 1440 patients). Performance was evaluated on independent test sets using the Dice score for segmentation and the Prostate Imaging: Cancer Artificial Intelligence (PI-CAI) score, defined as the average of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and average precision, for csPCa detection. P-values for performance differences were calculated using permutation testing. Results: The FL configurations were independently optimized for both tasks, showing improved performance at 1 epoch 300 rounds using FedMedian for prostate segmentation and 5 epochs 200 rounds using FedAdagrad, for csPCa detection. Compared with the average performance of the clients, the optimized FL model significantly improved performance in prostate segmentation and csPCa detection on the independent test set. The optimized FL model showed higher lesion detection performance compared to the FL-baseline model, but no evidence of a difference was observed for prostate segmentation. Conclusions: FL enhanced the performance and generalizability of MRI prostate segmentation and csPCa detection compared with local models, and optimizing its configuration further improved lesion detection performance.

Title: Pathology Foundation Models are Scanner Sensitive: Benchmark and Mitigation with Contrastive ScanGen Loss
Authors: Gianluca Carloni, Biagio Brattoli, Seongho Keum, Jongchan Park, Taebum Lee, Chang Ho Ahn, Sergio Pereira
Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) has shown great potential in mining actionable insights from Whole Slide Images (WSIs). Deep Learning (DL) has been at the center of modern CPath, and while it delivers unprecedented performance, it is also known that DL may be affected by irrelevant details, such as those introduced during scanning by different commercially available scanners. This may lead to scanner bias, where the model outputs for the same tissue acquired by different scanners may vary. In turn, it hinders the trust of clinicians in CPath-based tools and their deployment in real-world clinical practices. Recent pathology Foundation Models (FMs) promise to provide better domain generalization capabilities. In this paper, we benchmark FMs using a multi-scanner dataset and show that FMs still suffer from scanner bias. Following this observation, we propose ScanGen, a contrastive loss function applied during task-specific fine-tuning that mitigates scanner bias, thereby enhancing the models' robustness to scanner variations. Our approach is applied to the Multiple Instance Learning task of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation prediction from H\&E-stained WSIs in lung cancer. We observe that ScanGen notably enhances the ability to generalize across scanners, while retaining or improving the performance of EGFR mutation prediction.

Title: Derivative Estimation from Coarse, Irregular, Noisy Samples: An MLE-Spline Approach
Authors: Konstantin E. Avrachenkov, Leonid B. Freidovich
Abstract: We address numerical differentiation under coarse, non-uniform sampling and Gaussian noise. A maximum-likelihood estimator with $L_2$-norm constraint on a higher-order derivative is obtained, yielding spline-based solution. We introduce a non-standard parameterization of quadratic splines and develop recursive online algorithms. Two formulations -- quadratic and zero-order -- offer tradeoff between smoothness and computational speed. Simulations demonstrate superior performance over high-gain observers and super-twisting differentiators under coarse sampling and high noise, benefiting systems where higher sampling rates are impractical.

Title: Deployment of Objects with a Soft Everting Robot
Authors: Ethan DeVries, Jack Ferlazzo, Mustafa Ugur, Laura H. Blumenschein
Abstract: Soft everting robots present significant advantages over traditional rigid robots, including enhanced dexterity, improved environmental interaction, and safe navigation in unpredictable environments. While soft everting robots have been widely demonstrated for exploration type tasks, their potential to move and deploy payloads in such tasks has been less investigated, with previous work focusing on sensors and tools for the robot. Leveraging the navigation capabilities, and deployed body, of the soft everting robot to deliver payloads in hazardous areas, e.g. carrying a water bottle to a person stuck under debris, would represent a significant capability in many applications. In this work, we present an analysis of how soft everting robots can be used to deploy larger, heavier payloads through the inside of the robot. We analyze both what objects can be deployed and what terrain features they can be carried through. Building on existing models, we present methods to quantify the effects of payloads on robot growth and self-support, and develop a model to predict payload slip. We then experimentally quantify payload transport using soft everting robot with a variety of payload shapes, sizes, and weights and though a series of tasks: steering, vertical transport, movement through holes, and movement across gaps. Overall, the results show that we can transport payloads in a variety of shapes and up to 1.5kg in weight and that we can move through circular apertures with as little as 0.01cm clearance around payloads, carry out discrete turns up to 135 degrees, and move across unsupported gaps of 1.15m in length.

Title: Quantum-Inspired Audio Unlearning: Towards Privacy-Preserving Voice Biometrics
Authors: Shreyansh Pathak, Sonu Shreshtha, Richa Singh, Mayank Vatsa
Abstract: The widespread adoption of voice-enabled authentication and audio biometric systems have significantly increased privacy vulnerabilities associated with sensitive speech data. Compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR's right to be forgotten and India's DPDP Act necessitates targeted and efficient erasure of individual-specific voice signatures from already-trained biometric models. Existing unlearning methods designed for visual data inadequately handle the sequential, temporal, and high-dimensional nature of audio signals, leading to ineffective or incomplete speaker and accent erasure. To address this, we introduce QPAudioEraser, a quantum-inspired audio unlearning framework. Our our-phase approach involves: (1) weight initialization using destructive interference to nullify target features, (2) superposition-based label transformations that obscure class identity, (3) an uncertainty-maximizing quantum loss function, and (4) entanglement-inspired mixing of correlated weights to retain model knowledge. Comprehensive evaluations with ResNet18, ViT, and CNN architectures across AudioMNIST, Speech Commands, LibriSpeech, and Speech Accent Archive datasets validate QPAudioEraser's superior performance. The framework achieves complete erasure of target data (0% Forget Accuracy) while incurring minimal impact on model utility, with a performance degradation on retained data as low as 0.05%. QPAudioEraser consistently surpasses conventional baselines across single-class, multi-class, sequential, and accent-level erasure scenarios, establishing the proposed approach as a robust privacy-preserving solution.

Title: Large Language Model-Based Framework for Explainable Cyberattack Detection in Automatic Generation Control Systems
Authors: Muhammad Sharshar, Ahmad Mohammad Saber, Davor Svetinovic, Amr M. Youssef, Deepa Kundur, Ehab F. El-Saadany
Abstract: The increasing digitization of smart grids has improved operational efficiency but also introduced new cybersecurity vulnerabilities, such as False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) targeting Automatic Generation Control (AGC) systems. While machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in detecting such attacks, their opaque decision-making limits operator trust and real-world applicability. This paper proposes a hybrid framework that integrates lightweight ML-based attack detection with natural language explanations generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Classifiers such as LightGBM achieve up to 95.13% attack detection accuracy with only 0.004 s inference latency. Upon detecting a cyberattack, the system invokes LLMs, including GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo, and GPT-4o mini, to generate human-readable explanation of the event. Evaluated on 100 test samples, GPT-4o mini with 20-shot prompting achieved 93% accuracy in identifying the attack target, a mean absolute error of 0.075 pu in estimating attack magnitude, and 2.19 seconds mean absolute error (MAE) in estimating attack onset. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively balances real-time detection with interpretable, high-fidelity explanations, addressing a critical need for actionable AI in smart grid cybersecurity.

Title: Decoding Neural Signatures of Semantic Evaluations in Depression and Suicidality
Authors: Woojae Jeong, Aditya Kommineni, Kleanthis Avramidis, Colin McDaniel, Donald Berry, Myzelle Hughes, Thomas McGee, Elsi Kaiser, Dani Byrd, Assal Habibi, B. Rael Cahn, Idan A. Blank, Kristina Lerman, Dimitrios Pantazis, Sudarsana R. Kadiri, Takfarinas Medani, Shrikanth Narayanan, Richard M. Leahy
Abstract: Depression and suicidality profoundly impact cognition and emotion, yet objective neurophysiological biomarkers remain elusive. We investigated the spatiotemporal neural dynamics underlying affective semantic processing in individuals with varying levels of clinical severity of depression and suicidality using multivariate decoding of electroencephalography (EEG) data. Participants (N=137) completed a sentence evaluation task involving emotionally charged self-referential statements while EEG was recorded. We identified robust, neural signatures of semantic processing, with peak decoding accuracy between 300-600 ms -- a window associated with automatic semantic evaluation and conflict monitoring. Compared to healthy controls, individuals with depression and suicidality showed earlier onset, longer duration, and greater amplitude decoding responses, along with broader cross-temporal generalization and increased activation of frontocentral and parietotemporal components. These findings suggest altered sensitivity and impaired disengagement from emotionally salient content in the clinical groups, advancing our understanding of the neurocognitive basis of mental health and providing a principled basis for developing reliable EEG-based biomarkers of depression and suicidality.

Title: A Two-Step Learning Framework for Enhancing Sound Event Localization and Detection
Authors: Hogeon Yu
Abstract: Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) is crucial in spatial audio processing, enabling systems to detect sound events and estimate their 3D directions. Existing SELD methods use single- or dual-branch architectures: single-branch models share SED and DoA representations, causing optimization conflicts, while dual-branch models separate tasks but limit information exchange. To address this, we propose a two-step learning framework. First, we introduce a tracwise reordering format to maintain temporal consistency, preventing event reassignments across tracks. Next, we train SED and DoA networks to prevent interference and ensure task-specific feature learning. Finally, we effectively fuse DoA and SED features to enhance SELD performance with better spatial and event representation. Experiments on the 2023 DCASE challenge Task 3 dataset validate our framework, showing its ability to overcome single- and dual-branch limitations and improve event classification and localization.

Title: Resilient State Recovery using Prior Measurement Support Information
Authors: Yu Zheng, Olugbenga Moses Anubi, Warren E. Dixon
Abstract: Resilient state recovery of cyber-physical systems has attracted much research attention due to the unique challenges posed by the tight coupling between communication, computation, and the underlying physics of such systems. By modeling attacks as additive adversary signals to a sparse subset of measurements, this resilient recovery problem can be formulated as an error correction problem. To achieve exact state recovery, most existing results require less than $50\%$ of the measurement nodes to be compromised, which limits the resiliency of the estimators. In this paper, we show that observer resiliency can be further improved by incorporating data-driven prior information. We provide an analytical bridge between the precision of prior information and the resiliency of the estimator. By quantifying the relationship between the estimation error of the weighted $\ell_1$ observer and the precision of the support prior. This quantified relationship provides guidance for the estimator's weight design to achieve optimal resiliency. Several numerical simulations and an application case study are presented to validate the theoretical claims.

Title: Prediction of acoustic field in 1-D uniform duct with varying mean flow and temperature using neural networks
Authors: D. Veerababu, Prasanta K. Ghosh
Abstract: Neural networks constrained by the physical laws emerged as an alternate numerical tool. In this paper, the governing equation that represents the propagation of sound inside a one-dimensional duct carrying a heterogeneous medium is derived. The problem is converted into an unconstrained optimization problem and solved using neural networks. Both the acoustic state variables: acoustic pressure and particle velocity are predicted and validated with the traditional Runge-Kutta solver. The effect of the temperature gradient on the acoustic field is studied. Utilization of machine learning techniques such as transfer learning and automatic differentiation for acoustic applications is demonstrated.

Title: End-to-end image compression and reconstruction with ultrahigh speed and ultralow energy enabled by opto-electronic computing processor
Authors: Yuhang Wang, Ang Li, Yihang Shao, Qiang Li, Yang Zhao, Shilong Pan
Abstract: The rapid development of AR/VR, remote sensing, satellite radar, and medical equipment has created an imperative demand for ultra efficient image compression and reconstruction that exceed the capabilities of electronic processors. For the first time, we demonstrate an end to end image compression and reconstruction approach using an optoelectronic computing processor,achieving orders of magnitude higher speed and lower energy consumption than electronic counterparts. At its core is a 32X32 silicon photonic computing chip, which monolithically integrates 32 high speed modulators, 32 detectors, and a programmable photonic matrix core, copackaged with all necessary control electronics (TIA, ADC, DAC, FPGA etc.). Leveraging the photonic matrix core programmability, the processor generates trainable compressive matrices, enabling adjustable image compression ratios (from 2X to 256X) to meet diverse application needs. Deploying a custom lightweight photonic integrated circuit oriented network (LiPICO-Net) enables high quality reconstruction of compressed images. Our approach delivers an end to end latency of only 49.5ps/pixel while consuming only less than 10.6nJ/pixel-both metrics representing 2-3 orders of magnitude improvement compared with classical models running on state-of-the-art GPUs. We validate the system on a 130 million-pixel aerial imagery, enabling real time compression where electronic systems falter due to power and latency constraints. This work not only provides a transformative solution for massive image processing but also opens new avenues for photonic computing applications.

Title: Set Invariance with Probability One for Controlled Diffusion: Score-based Approach
Authors: Wenqing Wang, Alexis M.H. Teter, Murat Arcak, Abhishek Halder
Abstract: Given a controlled diffusion and a connected, bounded, Lipschitz set, when is it possible to guarantee controlled set invariance with probability one? In this work, we answer this question by deriving the necessary and sufficient conditions for the same in terms of gradients of certain log-likelihoods -- a.k.a. score vector fields -- for two cases: given finite time horizon and infinite time horizon. The deduced conditions comprise a score-based test that provably certifies or falsifies the existence of Markovian controllers for given controlled set invariance problem data. Our results are constructive in the sense when the problem data passes the proposed test, we characterize all controllers guaranteeing the desired set invariance. When the problem data fails the proposed test, there does not exist a controller that can accomplish the desired set invariance with probability one. The computation in the proposed tests involve solving certain Dirichlet boundary value problems, and in the finite horizon case, can also account for additional constraint of hitting a target subset at the terminal time. We illustrate the results using several semi-analytical and numerical examples.

Title: Safety Evaluation of Motion Plans Using Trajectory Predictors as Forward Reachable Set Estimators
Authors: Kaustav Chakraborty, Zeyuan Feng, Sushant Veer, Apoorva Sharma, Wenhao Ding, Sever Topan, Boris Ivanovic, Marco Pavone, Somil Bansal
Abstract: The advent of end-to-end autonomy stacks - often lacking interpretable intermediate modules - has placed an increased burden on ensuring that the final output, i.e., the motion plan, is safe in order to validate the safety of the entire stack. This requires a safety monitor that is both complete (able to detect all unsafe plans) and sound (does not flag safe plans). In this work, we propose a principled safety monitor that leverages modern multi-modal trajectory predictors to approximate forward reachable sets (FRS) of surrounding agents. By formulating a convex program, we efficiently extract these data-driven FRSs directly from the predicted state distributions, conditioned on scene context such as lane topology and agent history. To ensure completeness, we leverage conformal prediction to calibrate the FRS and guarantee coverage of ground-truth trajectories with high probability. To preserve soundness in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios or under predictor failure, we introduce a Bayesian filter that dynamically adjusts the FRS conservativeness based on the predictor's observed performance. We then assess the safety of the ego vehicle's motion plan by checking for intersections with these calibrated FRSs, ensuring the plan remains collision-free under plausible future behaviors of others. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset show our approach significantly improves soundness while maintaining completeness, offering a practical and reliable safety monitor for learned autonomy stacks.

Title: MoirÃ© Zero: An Efficient and High-Performance Neural Architecture for MoirÃ© Removal
Authors: Seungryong Lee, Woojeong Baek, Younghyun Kim, Eunwoo Kim, Haru Moon, Donggon Yoo, Eunbyung Park
Abstract: MoirÃ© patterns, caused by frequency aliasing between fine repetitive structures and a camera sensor's sampling process, have been a significant obstacle in various real-world applications, such as consumer photography and industrial defect inspection. With the advancements in deep learning algorithms, numerous studies-predominantly based on convolutional neural networks-have suggested various solutions to address this issue. Despite these efforts, existing approaches still struggle to effectively eliminate artifacts due to the diverse scales, orientations, and color shifts of moirÃ© patterns, primarily because the constrained receptive field of CNN-based architectures limits their ability to capture the complex characteristics of moirÃ© patterns. In this paper, we propose MZNet, a U-shaped network designed to bring images closer to a 'Moire-Zero' state by effectively removing moirÃ© patterns. It integrates three specialized components: Multi-Scale Dual Attention Block (MSDAB) for extracting and refining multi-scale features, Multi-Shape Large Kernel Convolution Block (MSLKB) for capturing diverse moirÃ© structures, and Feature Fusion-Based Skip Connection for enhancing information flow. Together, these components enhance local texture restoration and large-scale artifact suppression. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MZNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on high-resolution datasets and delivers competitive results on lower-resolution dataset, while maintaining a low computational cost, suggesting that it is an efficient and practical solution for real-world applications.

Title: TopoLiDM: Topology-Aware LiDAR Diffusion Models for Interpretable and Realistic LiDAR Point Cloud Generation
Authors: Jiuming Liu, Zheng Huang, Mengmeng Liu, Tianchen Deng, Francesco Nex, Hao Cheng, Hesheng Wang
Abstract: LiDAR scene generation is critical for mitigating real-world LiDAR data collection costs and enhancing the robustness of downstream perception tasks in autonomous driving. However, existing methods commonly struggle to capture geometric realism and global topological consistency. Recent LiDAR Diffusion Models (LiDMs) predominantly embed LiDAR points into the latent space for improved generation efficiency, which limits their interpretable ability to model detailed geometric structures and preserve global topological consistency. To address these challenges, we propose TopoLiDM, a novel framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with diffusion models under topological regularization for high-fidelity LiDAR generation. Our approach first trains a topological-preserving VAE to extract latent graph representations by graph construction and multiple graph convolutional layers. Then we freeze the VAE and generate novel latent topological graphs through the latent diffusion models. We also introduce 0-dimensional persistent homology (PH) constraints, ensuring the generated LiDAR scenes adhere to real-world global topological structures. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset demonstrate TopoLiDM's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving improvements of 22.6% lower Frechet Range Image Distance (FRID) and 9.2% lower Minimum Matching Distance (MMD). Notably, our model also enables fast generation speed with an average inference time of 1.68 samples/s, showcasing its scalability for real-world applications. We will release the related codes at this https URL.

Title: DACA-Net: A Degradation-Aware Conditional Diffusion Network for Underwater Image Enhancement
Authors: Chang Huang, Jiahang Cao, Jun Ma, Kieren Yu, Cong Li, Huayong Yang, Kaishun Wu
Abstract: Underwater images typically suffer from severe colour distortions, low visibility, and reduced structural clarity due to complex optical effects such as scattering and absorption, which greatly degrade their visual quality and limit the performance of downstream visual perception tasks. Existing enhancement methods often struggle to adaptively handle diverse degradation conditions and fail to leverage underwater-specific physical priors effectively. In this paper, we propose a degradation-aware conditional diffusion model to enhance underwater images adaptively and robustly. Given a degraded underwater image as input, we first predict its degradation level using a lightweight dual-stream convolutional network, generating a continuous degradation score as semantic guidance. Based on this score, we introduce a novel conditional diffusion-based restoration network with a Swin UNet backbone, enabling adaptive noise scheduling and hierarchical feature refinement. To incorporate underwater-specific physical priors, we further propose a degradation-guided adaptive feature fusion module and a hybrid loss function that combines perceptual consistency, histogram matching, and feature-level contrast. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method effectively restores underwater images with superior colour fidelity, perceptual quality, and structural details. Compared with SOTA approaches, our framework achieves significant improvements in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visual assessments.

Authors: Pablo Picazo-Martinez, Carlos Barroso-FernÃ¡ndez, Alejandro Calvillo-Fernandez, Milan Groshev, Carlos J. Bernardos, Antonio de la Oliva, Alain Mourad
Abstract: This paper presents a novel multiband passive sensing system that leverages IEEE 802.11bf Wi-Fi signals for environmental sensing, focusing on both sub-7 GHz and millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands. By combining Channel State Information (CSI) from multiple bands, the system enhances accuracy and reliability in detecting human presence, movement, and activities in indoor environments. Utilizing a novel model, called MILAGRO, the system demonstrates robust performance across different scenarios, including monitoring human presence in workspaces and tracking movement in corridors. Experimental results show high accuracy (95-100%), with improved performance by integrating multiband data. The system also addresses key security concerns associated with passive sensing, proposing measures to mitigate potential risks. This work advances the use of Wi-Fi for passive sensing by reducing reliance on active sensing infrastructure and extending the capabilities of low-cost, non-intrusive environmental monitoring.

Title: Adaptive Duration Model for Text Speech Alignment
Authors: Junjie Cao
Abstract: Speech-to-text alignment is a critical component of neural text to-speech (TTS) models. Autoregressive TTS models typically use an attention mechanism to learn these alignments on-line. However, these alignments tend to be brittle and often fail to generalize to long utterances and out-of-domain text, leading to missing or repeating words. Most non-autoregressive end to-end TTS models rely on durations extracted from external sources, using additional duration models for alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel duration prediction framework that can give compromising phoneme-level duration distribution with given text. In our experiments, the proposed duration model has more precise prediction and condition adaptation ability compared to previous baseline models. Numerically, it has roughly a 11.3 percents immprovement on alignment accuracy, and makes the performance of zero-shot TTS models more robust to the mismatch between prompt audio and input audio.

Title: Next Tokens Denoising for Speech Synthesis
Authors: Yanqing Liu, Ruiqing Xue, Chong Zhang, Yufei Liu, Gang Wang, Bohan Li, Yao Qian, Lei He, Shujie Liu, Sheng Zhao
Abstract: While diffusion and autoregressive (AR) models have significantly advanced generative modeling, they each present distinct limitations. AR models, which rely on causal attention, cannot exploit future context and suffer from slow generation speeds. Conversely, diffusion models struggle with key-value (KV) caching. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Dragon-FM, a novel text-to-speech (TTS) design that unifies AR and flow-matching. This model processes 48 kHz audio codec tokens in chunks at a compact 12.5 tokens per second rate. This design enables AR modeling across chunks, ensuring global coherence, while parallel flow-matching within chunks facilitates fast iterative denoising. Consequently, the proposed model can utilize KV-cache across chunks and incorporate future context within each chunk. Furthermore, it bridges continuous and discrete feature modeling, demonstrating that continuous AR flow-matching can predict discrete tokens with finite scalar quantizers. This efficient codec and fast chunk-autoregressive architecture also makes the proposed model particularly effective for generating extended content. Experiment for demos of our work} on podcast datasets demonstrate its capability to efficiently generate high-quality zero-shot podcasts.

Title: Ambiguity-Aware Segmented Estimation of Mutual Coupling in Large RIS: Algorithm and Experimental Validation
Authors: Philipp del Hougne
Abstract: Optimizing a real-life RIS-parametrized wireless channel with a physics-consistent multiport-network model necessitates prior remote estimation of the mutual coupling (MC) between RIS elements. The number of MC parameters grows quadratically with the number of RIS elements, posing scalability challenges. Because of inevitable ambiguities, independently estimated segments of the MC matrix cannot be easily stitched together. Here, by carefully handling the ambiguities, we achieve a separation of the full estimation problem into three sequentially treated sets of smaller problems. We partition the RIS elements into groups. First, we estimate the MC for one group as well as the characteristics of the available loads. Second, we separately estimate the MC for each of the remaining groups, in each case with partial overlap with an already characterized group. Third, we separately estimate the MC between each distinct pair of groups. Full parallelization is feasible within the second and third sets of problems, and the third set of problems can furthermore benefit from efficient initialization. We experimentally validate our algorithm for a 4x4 MIMO channel parametrized by a 100-element RIS inside a rich-scattering environment. Our experimentally calibrated 5867-parameter multiport-network model achieves an accuracy of 40.5 dB, whereas benchmark models with limited or no MC awareness only reach 17.0 dB and 13.8 dB, respectively. Based on the experimentally calibrated models, we optimize the RIS for five wireless performance indicators. Experimental measurements with the optimized RIS configurations demonstrate only moderate benefits of MC awareness in RIS optimization in terms of the achieved performance. However, we observe that limited or no MC awareness markedly erodes the reliability of model-based predictions of the expected performance.

Authors: Felix Kronenwett, Georg Maier, Thomas Laengle
Abstract: Sensor-based sorting systems enable the physical separation of a material stream into two fractions. The sorting decision is based on the image data evaluation of the sensors used and is carried out using actuators. Various process parameters must be set depending on the properties of the material stream, the dimensioning of the system, and the required sorting accuracy. However, continuous verification and re-adjustment are necessary due to changing requirements and material stream compositions. In this paper, we introduce an approach for optimizing, recurrently monitoring and adjusting the process parameters of a sensor-based sorting system. Based on Bayesian Optimization, Gaussian process regression models are used as surrogate models to achieve specific requirements for system behavior with the uncertainties contained therein. This method minimizes the number of necessary experiments while simultaneously considering two possible optimization targets based on the requirements for both material output streams. In addition, uncertainties are considered during determining sorting accuracies in the model calculation. We evaluated the method with three example process parameters.

Title: Bayesian Optimization applied for accelerated Virtual Validation of the Autonomous Driving Function
Authors: Satyesh Shanker Awasthi, Mohammed Irshadh Ismaaeel Sathyamangalam Imran, Stefano Arrigoni, Francesco Braghin
Abstract: Rigorous Verification and Validation (V&V) of Autonomous Driving Functions (ADFs) is paramount for ensuring the safety and public acceptance of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). Current validation relies heavily on simulation to achieve sufficient test coverage within the Operational Design Domain (ODD) of a vehicle, but exhaustively exploring the vast parameter space of possible scenarios is computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work introduces a framework based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) to accelerate the discovery of critical scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework on an Model Predictive Controller (MPC)-based motion planner, showing that it identifies hazardous situations, such as off-road events, using orders of magnitude fewer simulations than brute-force Design of Experiments (DoE) methods. Furthermore, this study investigates the scalability of the framework in higher-dimensional parameter spaces and its ability to identify multiple, distinct critical regions within the ODD of the motion planner used as the case study .

Title: Morph: ChirpTransformer-based Encoder-decoder Co-design for Reliable LoRa Communication
Authors: Yidong Ren, Maolin Gan, Chenning Li, Shakhrul Iman Siam, Mi Zhang, Shigang Chen, Zhichao Cao
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Morph, a LoRa encoder-decoder co-design to enhance communication reliability while improving its computation efficiency in extremely-low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) situations. The standard LoRa encoder controls 6 Spreading Factors (SFs) to tradeoff SNR tolerance with data rate. SF-12 is the maximum SF providing the lowest SNR tolerance on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) LoRa nodes. In Morph, we develop an SF-configuration based encoder to mimic the larger SFs beyond SF-12 while it is compatible with COTS LoRa nodes. Specifically, we manipulate four SF configurations of a Morph symbol to encode 2-bit data. Accordingly, we recognize the used SF configuration of the symbol for data decoding. We leverage a Deep Neural Network (DNN) decoder to fully capture multi-dimensional features among diverse SF configurations to maximize the SNR gain. Moreover, we customize the input size, neural network structure, and training method of the DNN decoder to improve its efficiency, reliability, and generalizability. We implement Morph with COTS LoRa nodes and a USRP N210, then evaluate its performance on indoor and campus-scale testbeds. Results show that we can reliably decode data at -28.8~dB SNR, which is 6.4~dB lower than the standard LoRa with SF-12 chirps. In addition, the computation efficiency of our DNN decoder is about 3x higher than state-of-the-art.

Title: Age of Estimates: When to Submit Jobs to a Markov Machine to Maximize Revenue
Authors: Sahan Liyanaarachchi, Sennur Ulukus
Abstract: With the dawn of AI factories ushering a new era of computing supremacy, development of strategies to effectively track and utilize the available computing resources is garnering utmost importance. These computing resources are often modeled as Markov sources, which oscillate between free and busy states, depending on their internal load and external utilization, and are commonly referred to as Markov machines (MMs). Most of the prior work solely focuses on the problem of tracking these MMs, while often assuming a rudimentary decision process that governs their utilization. Our key observation is that the ultimate goal of tracking a MM is to properly utilize it. In this work, we consider the problem of maximizing the utility of a MM, where the utility is defined as the average revenue generated by the MM. Assuming a Poisson job arrival process and a query-based sampling procedure to sample the state of the MM, we find the optimal times to submit the available jobs to the MM so as to maximize the average revenue generated per unit job. We show that, depending on the parameters of the MM, the optimal policy is in the form of either a \emph{threshold policy} or a \emph{switching policy} based on the \emph{age of our estimate} of the state of the MM.

Title: Beyond Image Prior: Embedding Noise Prior into Conditional Denoising Transformer
Authors: Yuanfei Huang, Hua Huang
Abstract: Existing learning-based denoising methods typically train models to generalize the image prior from large-scale datasets, suffering from the variability in noise distributions encountered in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a new perspective on the denoising challenge by highlighting the distinct separation between noise and image priors. This insight forms the basis for our development of conditional optimization framework, designed to overcome the constraints of traditional denoising framework. To this end, we introduce a Locally Noise Prior Estimation (LoNPE) algorithm, which accurately estimates the noise prior directly from a single raw noisy image. This estimation acts as an explicit prior representation of the camera sensor's imaging environment, distinct from the image prior of scenes. Additionally, we design an auxiliary learnable LoNPE network tailored for practical application to sRGB noisy images. Leveraging the estimated noise prior, we present a novel Conditional Denoising Transformer (Condformer), by incorporating the noise prior into a conditional self-attention mechanism. This integration allows the Condformer to segment the optimization process into multiple explicit subspaces, significantly enhancing the model's generalization and flexibility. Extensive experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance over current state-of-the-art methods.

Title: A reference frame-based microgrid primary control for ensuring global convergence to a periodic orbit
Authors: Xinyuan Jiang, Constantino M. Lagoa, Daning Huang, Yan Li
Abstract: Power systems with a high penetration of renewable generation are vulnerable to frequency oscillation and voltage instability. Traditionally, the stability of power systems is considered either in terms of local stability or as an angle oscillator synchronization problem with the simplifying assumption that the dynamics of the amplitudes are on much shorter time scales. Without this assumption, however, the steady state being studied is essentially a limit cycle with the convergence of its orbit in question. In this paper, we present a method to analyze the orbital stability of a microgrid and propose a voltage controller for the inverter-interfaced renewable generators. The main hurdle to the problem lies in the constant terms in the rotating internal reference frames of each generator. We extend the shifted passivity of port-Hamiltonian systems to the analysis of limit cycles and prove that, if the system is shifted passive without considering these constant terms, then the periodic orbit is globally attractive. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first global stability result for non-nominal steady states of the microgrid in the full state space, which provides new insights into the synchronization phenomenon where the dissipativity of the system ensures convergence. The proposed controller is verified with a test microgrid, demonstrating its stability and transient smoothness compared to the standard droop control.

Title: Mutual Coupling-Aware Channel Estimation and Beamforming for RIS-Assisted Communications
Authors: Pinjun Zheng, Simon Tarboush, Hadi Sarieddeen, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri
Abstract: This work studies the problems of channel estimation and beamforming for active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication, incorporating the mutual coupling (MC) effect through an electromagnetically consistent model. We first demonstrate that MC can be incorporated into a compressed sensing (CS) formulation, albeit with an increase in the dimensionality of the sensing matrix. To overcome this increased complexity, we propose a two-stage strategy. Initially, a low-complexity MC-unaware CS estimation is performed to obtain a coarse channel estimate, which is then used to implement a dictionary reduction (DR) for the MC-aware estimation, effectively reducing the dimensionality of the sensing matrices. This method achieves estimation accuracy close to the direct MC-aware CS method with less overall computational complexity. Furthermore, we consider the joint optimization of RIS configuration, base station precoding, and user combining in a single-user MIMO system. We employ an alternating optimization strategy to optimize these three beamformers. The primary challenge lies in optimizing the RIS configuration, as the MC effect renders the problem non-convex and intractable. To address this, we propose a novel algorithm based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) and the Neumann series expansion. Within the SCA framework, we propose a surrogate function that rigorously satisfies both convexity and equal-gradient conditions to update the iteration direction. Numerical results validate our proposal, demonstrating that the proposed channel estimation and beamforming methods effectively manage the MC in RIS, achieving higher spectral efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Title: Koopman-based control using sum-of-squares optimization: Improved stability guarantees and data efficiency
Authors: Robin StrÃ¤sser, Julian Berberich, Frank AllgÃ¶wer
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel controller design approach for unknown nonlinear systems using the Koopman operator. In particular, we use the recently proposed stability- and certificate-oriented extended dynamic mode decomposition (SafEDMD) architecture to generate a data-driven bilinear surrogate model with certified error bounds. Then, by accounting for the obtained error bounds in a controller design based on the bilinear system, one can guarantee closed-loop stability for the true nonlinear system. While existing approaches over-approximate the bilinearity of the surrogate model, thus introducing conservatism and providing only local guarantees, we explicitly account for the bilinearity by using sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization in the controller design. More precisely, we parametrize a rational controller stabilizing the error-affected bilinear surrogate model and, consequently, the underlying nonlinear system. The resulting SOS optimization problem provides explicit data-driven controller design conditions for unknown nonlinear systems based on semidefinite programming. Our approach significantly reduces conservatism by establishing a larger region of attraction and improved data efficiency. The proposed method is evaluated using numerical examples, demonstrating its advantages over existing approaches.

Title: Uncovering the role of semantic and acoustic cues in normal and dichotic listening
Authors: Sai Samrat Kankanala, Akshara Soman, Sriram Ganapathy
Abstract: Speech comprehension is an involuntary task for the healthy human brain, yet the understanding of the mechanisms underlying this brain functionality remains obscure. In this paper, we aim to quantify the role of acoustic and semantic information streams in complex listening conditions. We propose a paradigm to understand the encoding of the speech cues in electroencephalogram (EEG) data, by designing a match-mismatch (MM) classification task. The MM task involves identifying whether the stimulus (speech) and response (EEG) correspond to each other. We build a multimodal deep-learning based sequence model STEM, which is input with acoustic stimulus (speech envelope), semantic stimulus (textual representations of speech), and the neural response (EEG data). We perform extensive experiments on two separate conditions, i) natural passive listening and, ii) a dichotic listening requiring auditory attention. Using the MM task as the analysis framework, we observe that - a) speech perception is fragmented based on word boundaries, b) acoustic and semantic cues offer similar levels of MM task performance in natural listening conditions, and c) semantic cues offer significantly improved MM classification over acoustic cues in dichotic listening task. The comparison of the STEM with previously proposed MM models shows significant performance improvements for the proposed approach. The analysis and understanding from this study allows the quantification of the roles played by acoustic and semantic cues in diverse listening tasks and in providing further evidences of right-ear advantage in dichotic listening.

Title: Unsupervised Multi-Parameter Inverse Solving for Reducing Ring Artifacts in 3D X-Ray CBCT
Authors: Qing Wu, Hongjiang Wei, Jingyi Yu, Yuyao Zhang
Abstract: Ring artifacts are prevalent in 3D cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) due to non-ideal responses of X-ray detectors, substantially affecting image quality and diagnostic reliability. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) ring artifact reduction (RAR) methods rely on supervised learning with large-scale paired CT datasets. While effective in-domain, supervised methods tend to struggle to fully capture the physical characteristics of ring artifacts, leading to pronounced performance drops in complex real-world acquisitions. Moreover, their scalability to 3D CBCT is limited by high memory demands. In this work, we propose Riner, a new unsupervised RAR method. Based on a theoretical analysis of ring artifact formation, we reformulate RAR as a multi-parameter inverse problem, where the non-ideal responses of X-ray detectors are parameterized as solvable physical variables. Using a new differentiable forward model, Riner can jointly learn the implicit neural representation of artifact-free images and estimate the physical parameters directly from CT measurements, without external training data. Additionally, Riner is memory-friendly due to its ray-based optimization, enhancing its usability in large-scale 3D CBCT. Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets show Riner outperforms existing SOTA supervised methods.

Title: Generalized and Efficient 2D Gaussian Splatting for Arbitrary-scale Super-Resolution
Authors: Du Chen, Liyi Chen, Zhengqiang Zhang, Lei Zhang
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INR) have been successfully employed for Arbitrary-scale Super-Resolution (ASR). However, INR-based models need to query the multi-layer perceptron module numerous times and render a pixel in each query, resulting in insufficient representation capability and low computational efficiency. Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown its advantages over INR in both visual quality and rendering speed in 3D tasks, which motivates us to explore whether GS can be employed for the ASR task. However, directly applying GS to ASR is exceptionally challenging because the original GS is an optimization-based method through overfitting each single scene, while in ASR we aim to learn a single model that can generalize to different images and scaling factors. We overcome these challenges by developing two novel techniques. Firstly, to generalize GS for ASR, we elaborately design an architecture to predict the corresponding image-conditioned Gaussians of the input low-resolution image in a feed-forward manner. Each Gaussian can fit the shape and direction of an area of complex textures, showing powerful representation capability. Secondly, we implement an efficient differentiable 2D GPU/CUDA-based scale-aware rasterization to render super-resolved images by sampling discrete RGB values from the predicted continuous Gaussians. Via end-to-end training, our optimized network, namely GSASR, can perform ASR for any image and unseen scaling factors. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Title: Clinical Utility of Foundation Segmentation Models in Musculoskeletal MRI: Biomarker Fidelity and Predictive Outcomes
Authors: Gabrielle Hoyer, Michelle W Tong, Rupsa Bhattacharjee, Valentina Pedoia, Sharmila Majumdar
Abstract: Effective segmentation is fundamental for quantitative medical imaging; however, foundation segmentation models remain insufficiently evaluated for accuracy and biomarker fidelity across the diverse anatomical contexts and imaging protocols encountered in musculoskeletal (MSK) MRI. We evaluate three widely used segmentation models (SAM, SAM2, MedSAM) across eleven MSK MRI datasets spanning the knee, hip, spine, shoulder, and thigh. Our framework assesses both zero-shot and finetuned performance, with attention to segmentation accuracy, generalizability across imaging protocols, and reliability of derived quantitative biomarkers. Finetuned models showed consistent agreement with expert measurements for biomarkers including cartilage thickness, disc height, muscle volume, and compositional T1rho/T2 values. Automated prompting through the AutoLabel system enabled scalable segmentation, with moderate trade-offs in accuracy. As proof of concept, we applied the validated system to (i) a three-stage knee MRI triage cascade and (ii) a longitudinal landmark model that predicts total knee replacement and incident osteoarthritis. The framework offers a transparent method for benchmarking segmentation tools and connecting model performance to clinical imaging priorities.

Title: Skull-stripping induces shortcut learning in MRI-based Alzheimer's disease classification
Authors: Christian Tinauer, Maximilian Sackl, Rudolf Stollberger, Reinhold Schmidt, Stefan Ropele, Christian Langkammer
Abstract: Objectives:  High classification accuracy of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from structural MRI has been achieved using deep neural networks, yet the specific image features contributing to these decisions remain unclear. In this study, the contributions of T1-weighted (T1w) gray-white matter texture, volumetric information, and preprocessing -- particularly skull-stripping -- were systematically assessed. Methods: A dataset of 990 matched T1w MRIs from AD patients and cognitively normal controls from the ADNI database were used. Preprocessing was varied through skull-stripping and intensity binarization to isolate texture and shape contributions. A 3D convolutional neural network was trained on each configuration, and classification performance was compared using exact McNemar tests with discrete Bonferroni-Holm correction. Feature relevance was analyzed using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, image similarity metrics, and spectral clustering of relevance maps. Results: Despite substantial differences in image content, classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity remained stable across preprocessing conditions. Models trained on binarized images preserved performance, indicating minimal reliance on gray-white matter texture. Instead, volumetric features -- particularly brain contours introduced through skull-stripping -- were consistently used by the models. Conclusions: This behavior reflects a shortcut learning phenomenon, where preprocessing artifacts act as potentially unintended cues. The resulting Clever Hans effect emphasizes the critical importance of interpretability tools to reveal hidden biases and to ensure robust and trustworthy deep learning in medical imaging.

Title: AVSim -- Realistic Simulation Framework for Airborne and Vector-Borne Disease Dynamics

Abstract: Computational disease modeling plays a crucial role in understanding and controlling the transmission of infectious diseases. While agent-based models (ABMs) provide detailed insights into individual dynamics, accurately replicating human motion remains challenging due to its complex, multi-factorial nature. Most existing frameworks fail to model realistic human motion, leading to oversimplified and less realistic behavior modeling. Furthermore, many current models rely on synthetic assumptions and fail to account for realistic environmental structures, transportation systems, and behavioral heterogeneity across occupation groups. To address these limitations, we introduce AVSim, an agent-based simulation framework designed to model airborne and vector-borne disease dynamics under realistic conditions. A distinguishing feature of AVSim is its ability to accurately model the dual nature of human mobility (both the destinations individuals visit and the duration of their stay) by utilizing GPS traces from real-world participants, characterized by occupation. This enables a significantly more granular and realistic representation of human movement compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, spectral clustering combined with graph-theoretic analysis is used to uncover latent behavioral patterns within occupations, enabling fine-grained modeling of agent behavior. We validate the synthetic human mobility patterns against ground-truth GPS data and demonstrate AVSim's capabilities via simulations of COVID-19 and dengue. The results highlight AVSim's capacity to trace infection pathways, identify high-risk zones, and evaluate interventions such as vaccination, quarantine, and vector control with occupational and geographic specificity.

Title: CleanMel: Mel-Spectrogram Enhancement for Improving Both Speech Quality and ASR
Authors: Nian Shao, Rui Zhou, Pengyu Wang, Xian Li, Ying Fang, Yujie Yang, Xiaofei Li
Abstract: In this work, we propose CleanMel, a single-channel Mel-spectrogram denoising and dereverberation network for improving both speech quality and automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance. The proposed network takes as input the noisy and reverberant microphone recording and predicts the corresponding clean Mel-spectrogram. The enhanced Mel-spectrogram can be either transformed to the speech waveform with a neural vocoder or directly used for ASR. The proposed network is composed of interleaved cross-band and narrow-band processing in the Mel-frequency domain, for learning the full-band spectral pattern and the narrow-band properties of signals, respectively. Compared to linear-frequency domain or time-domain speech enhancement, the key advantage of Mel-spectrogram enhancement is that Mel-frequency presents speech in a more compact way and thus is easier to learn, which will benefit both speech quality and ASR. Experimental results on five English and one Chinese datasets demonstrate a significant improvement in both speech quality and ASR performance achieved by the proposed this http URL and audio examples of our model are available online.

Title: MAVFlow: Preserving Paralinguistic Elements with Conditional Flow Matching for Zero-Shot AV2AV Multilingual Translation
Authors: Sungwoo Cho, Jeongsoo Choi, Sungnyun Kim, Se-Young Yun
Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-speech (TTS) models, audio-visual-to-audio-visual (AV2AV) translation still faces a critical challenge: maintaining speaker consistency between the original and translated vocal and facial features. To address this issue, we propose a conditional flow matching (CFM) zero-shot audio-visual renderer that utilizes strong dual guidance from both audio and visual modalities. By leveraging multimodal guidance with CFM, our model robustly preserves speaker-specific characteristics and enhances zero-shot AV2AV translation abilities. For the audio modality, we enhance the CFM process by integrating robust speaker embeddings with x-vectors, which serve to bolster speaker consistency. Additionally, we convey emotional nuances to the face rendering module. The guidance provided by both audio and visual cues remains independent of semantic or linguistic content, allowing our renderer to effectively handle zero-shot translation tasks for monolingual speakers in different languages. We empirically demonstrate that the inclusion of high-quality mel-spectrograms conditioned on facial information not only enhances the quality of the synthesized speech but also positively influences facial generation, leading to overall performance improvements in LSE and FID score.

Title: Performance Analysis of Communication Signals for Localization in Underwater Sensor Networks
Authors: Ashwani Koul, Gustaf Hendeby, Isaac Skog
Abstract: Efficient localization in underwater sensor networks faces challenges due to limited bandwidth, energy constraints, and hardware complexity. Traditional systems separate sensing and communication, often resulting in inefficient resource usage. To address this, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged, leveraging shared waveforms for both functions. This paper investigates the feasibility of using communication-centric waveforms for underwater localization. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of super-permutated frequency shift keying and multiple frequency shift keying signals using a Cramer-Rao lower bound framework in a simplified bistatic scenario. Simulations incorporate temporally correlated autoregressive AR(1) noise and varying signal-to-noise ratio levels to assess localization accuracy. A comparative analysis with a traditional sonar waveform, linear frequency modulated signal, highlights the potential of communication signals for dual-purpose ISAC applications in bistatic sonar configurations in underwater environments.

Title: Automated MRI Tumor Segmentation using hybrid U-Net with Transformer and Efficient Attention
Authors: Syed Haider Ali, Asrar Ahmad, Muhammad Ali, Asifullah Khan, Nadeem Shaukat
Abstract: Cancer is an abnormal growth with potential to invade locally and metastasize to distant organs. Accurate auto-segmentation of the tumor and surrounding normal tissues is required for radiotherapy treatment plan optimization. Recent AI-based segmentation models are generally trained on large public datasets, which lack the heterogeneity of local patient populations. While these studies advance AI-based medical image segmentation, research on local datasets is necessary to develop and integrate AI tumor segmentation models directly into hospital software for efficient and accurate oncology treatment planning and execution. This study enhances tumor segmentation using computationally efficient hybrid UNet-Transformer models on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets acquired from a local hospital under strict privacy protection. We developed a robust data pipeline for seamless DICOM extraction and preprocessing, followed by extensive image augmentation to ensure model generalization across diverse clinical settings, resulting in a total dataset of 6080 images for training. Our novel architecture integrates UNet-based convolutional neural networks with a transformer bottleneck and complementary attention modules, including efficient attention, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and ResNeXt blocks. To accelerate convergence and reduce computational demands, we used a maximum batch size of 8 and initialized the encoder with pretrained ImageNet weights, training the model on dual NVIDIA T4 GPUs via checkpointing to overcome Kaggle's runtime limits. Quantitative evaluation on the local MRI dataset yielded a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.764 and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.736, demonstrating competitive performance despite limited data and underscoring the importance of site-specific model development for clinical deployment.

Title: DMCIE: Diffusion Model with Concatenation of Inputs and Errors to Improve the Accuracy of the Segmentation of Brain Tumors in MRI Images
Authors: Sara Yavari, Rahul Nitin Pandya, Jacob Furst
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans is essential for reliable clinical diagnosis and effective treatment planning. Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in image generation and segmentation tasks. This paper introduces a novel approach to corrective segmentation based on diffusion models. We propose DMCIE (Diffusion Model with Concatenation of Inputs and Errors), a novel framework for accurate brain tumor segmentation in multi-modal MRI scans. We employ a 3D U-Net to generate an initial segmentation mask, from which an error map is generated by identifying the differences between the prediction and the ground truth. The error map, concatenated with the original MRI images, are used to guide a diffusion model. Using multimodal MRI inputs (T1, T1ce, T2, FLAIR), DMCIE effectively enhances segmentation accuracy by focusing on misclassified regions, guided by the original inputs. Evaluated on the BraTS2020 dataset, DMCIE outperforms several state-of-the-art diffusion-based segmentation methods, achieving a Dice Score of 93.46 and an HD95 of 5.94 mm. These results highlight the effectiveness of error-guided diffusion in producing precise and reliable brain tumor segmentations.

Title: Controllable joint noise reduction and hearing loss compensation using a differentiable auditory model
Authors: Philippe Gonzalez, Torsten Dau, Tobias May
Abstract: Deep learning-based hearing loss compensation (HLC) seeks to enhance speech intelligibility and quality for hearing impaired listeners using neural networks. One major challenge of HLC is the lack of a ground-truth target. Recent works have used neural networks to emulate non-differentiable auditory peripheral models in closed-loop frameworks, but this approach lacks flexibility. Alternatively, differentiable auditory models allow direct optimization, yet previous studies focused on individual listener profiles, or joint noise reduction (NR) and HLC without balancing each task. This work formulates NR and HLC as a multi-task learning problem, training a system to simultaneously predict denoised and compensated signals from noisy speech and audiograms using a differentiable auditory model. Results show the system achieves similar objective metric performance to systems trained for each task separately, while being able to adjust the balance between NR and HLC during inference.

Title: Chirp-Permuted AFDM: A New Degree of Freedom for Next-Generation Versatile Waveform Design
Authors: Hyeon Seok Rou, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu
Abstract: We present a novel multicarrier waveform, termed chirp-permuted affine frequency division multiplexing (CP-AFDM), which introduces a unique chirp-permutation domain on top of the chirp subcarriers of the conventional AFDM. Rigorous analysis of the signal model and waveform properties, supported by numerical simulations, demonstrates that the proposed CP-AFDM preserves all core characteristics of affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) - including robustness to doubly-dispersive channels, peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), and full delay-Doppler representation - while further enhancing ambiguity function resolution and peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSLR) in the Doppler domain. These improvements establish CP-AFDM as a highly attractive candidate for emerging sixth generation (6G) use cases demanding both reliability and sensing-awareness. Moreover, by exploiting the vast degree of freedom in the chirp-permutation domain, two exemplary multifunctional applications are introduced: an index modulation (IM) technique over the permutation domain which achieves significant spectral efficiency gains, and a physical-layer security scheme that ensures practically perfect security through permutation-based keying, without requiring additional transmit energy or signaling overhead.

Title: Minimum Attention Control (MAC) in a Receding Horizon Framework with Applications
Authors: Ganesh Teja Theertham, Santhosh Kumar Varanasi, Phanindra Jampana
Abstract: Minimum Attention Control (MAC) is a control technique that provides minimal input changes to meet the control objective. Mathematically, the zero norm of the input changes is used as a constraint for the given control objective and minimized with respect to the process dynamics. In this paper, along with the zero norm constraint, stage costs are also considered for reference tracking in a receding horizon framework. For this purpose, the optimal inputs of the previous horizons are also considered in the optimization problem of the current horizon. An alternating minimization algorithm is applied to solve the optimization problem (Minimum Attention Model Predictive Control (MAMPC)). The outer step of the optimization is a quadratic program, while the inner step, which solves for sparsity, has an analytical solution. The proposed algorithm is implemented on two case studies: a four-tank system with slow dynamics and a fuel cell stack with fast dynamics. A detailed comparative study of the proposed algorithm with standard MPC indicates sparse control actions with a tradeoff in the tracking error.

Title: Swing Leg Motion Strategy for Heavy-load Legged Robot Based on Force Sensing
Authors: Ze Fu, Yinghui Li, Weizhong Guo
Abstract: The heavy-load legged robot has strong load carrying capacity and can adapt to various unstructured terrains. But the large weight results in higher requirements for motion stability and environmental perception ability. In order to utilize force sensing information to improve its motion performance, in this paper, we propose a finite state machine model for the swing leg in the static gait by imitating the movement of the elephant. Based on the presence or absence of additional terrain information, different trajectory planning strategies are provided for the swing leg to enhance the success rate of stepping and save energy. The experimental results on a novel quadruped robot show that our method has strong robustness and can enable heavy-load legged robots to pass through various complex terrains autonomously and smoothly.

Title: Mmm whatcha say? Uncovering distal and proximal context effects in first and second-language word perception using psychophysical reverse correlation
Authors: Paige TuttÃ¶sÃ­, H. Henny Yeung, Yue Wang, Fenqi Wang, Guillaume Denis, Jean-Julien Aucouturier, Angelica Lim
Abstract: Acoustic context effects, where surrounding changes in pitch, rate or timbre influence the perception of a sound, are well documented in speech perception, but how they interact with language background remains unclear. Using a reverse-correlation approach, we systematically varied the pitch and speech rate in phrases around different pairs of vowels for second language (L2) speakers of English (/i/-/I/) and French (/u/-/y/), thus reconstructing, in a data-driven manner, the prosodic profiles that bias their perception. Testing English and French speakers (n=25), we showed that vowel perception is in fact influenced by conflicting effects from the surrounding pitch and speech rate: a congruent proximal effect 0.2s pre-target and a distal contrastive effect up to 1s before; and found that L1 and L2 speakers exhibited strikingly similar prosodic profiles in perception. We provide a novel method to investigate acoustic context effects across stimuli, timescales, and acoustic domain.

Title: Estimation of Multi-Component Flow in the Kidney with Multi-b-value Spectral Diffusion
Authors: Mira M. Liu, Thomas Gladytz, Jonathan Dyke, Ian Bolger, Jonas Jasse, Sergio Calle, Tanner Crews, Surya Seshan, Steven Salvatore, Isaac Stillman, Thangamani Muthukumar, Bachir Taouli, Samira Farouk, Octavia Bane, Sara Lewis
Abstract: Purpose: Examine the theory and potential clinical application of estimated intravoxel flow of separated perfusion, tubular flow, and diffusion from multi-b-value DWI in kidney allografts. Methods: Multi-b-value DWI (9 b-values; 0-800 s/mm2) from a kidney cortex is simulated with anisotropic and non-Gaussian (i.e. anomalous) vascular, tubular, and tissue components and analyzed with a Bayesian biexponential, least-squares triexponential, and spectral diffusion MRI. Comparison and application of biexponential, triexponential, and spectral diffusion fD is demonstrated in a two-center study of 54 kidney allografts patients (21F/33M, 48.8 SD 10.5years) and compared to fibrosis (Banff 2017 interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy score 0-6 from clinical biopsies of the renal cortex), impaired kidney function (CKD-EPI 2021 eGFR<45ml/min/1.73m2), and proteinuria. Results: Spectral diffusion fD demonstrated strong correlation to input fD of the simulated anisotropic and anomalous components. It agreed with both three-component diffusion and two-component diffusion. fD showed similar or improved agreement and correlation to input compared to individual parameters, and similar or improved agreement to corresponding bi- and triexponential models. In kidney allografts, spectral diffusion fD showed higher allograft fibrosis score had higher fD_tissue, impaired allograft function showed reduced fD_tubule, and fD_vascular negatively correlated with proteinuria across diagnostic groups of function and fibrosis. Conclusions: Spectral diffusion MRI with multi-Gaussian fD as a flow proxy separated different anomalous and anisotropic diffusion components of perfusion, tubular flow, and tissue diffusion and may hold clinical value in diffusion MRI of kidney pathophysiology.

Title: Addressing Representation Collapse in Vector Quantized Models with One Linear Layer
Authors: Yongxin Zhu, Bocheng Li, Yifei Xin, Zhihua Xia, Linli Xu
Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) is essential for discretizing continuous representations in unsupervised learning but suffers from representation collapse, causing low codebook utilization and limiting scalability. Existing solutions often rely on complex optimizations or reduce latent dimensionality, which compromises model capacity and fails to fully solve the problem. We identify the root cause as disjoint codebook optimization, where only a few code vectors are updated via gradient descent. To fix this, we propose \textbf{Sim}ple\textbf{VQ}, which reparameterizes code vectors through a learnable linear transformation layer over a latent basis, optimizing the \textit{entire linear space} rather than nearest \textit{individual code vectors}. Although the multiplication of two linear matrices is equivalent to applying a single linear layer, this simple approach effectively prevents collapse. Extensive experiments on image and audio tasks demonstrate that SimVQ improves codebook usage, is easy to implement, and generalizes well across modalities and architectures.

Title: Free-Gate: Planning, Control And Policy Composition via Free Energy Gating
Authors: Francesca Rossi, Ãmiland GarrabÃ©, Giovanni Russo
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimally composing a set of primitives to tackle planning and control tasks. To address this problem, we introduce a free energy computational model for planning and control via policy composition: Free-Gate. Within Free-Gate, control primitives are combined via a gating mechanism that minimizes variational free energy. This composition problem is formulated as a finite-horizon optimal control problem, which we prove remains convex even when the cost is not convex in states/actions and the environment is nonlinear, stochastic and non-stationary. We develop an algorithm that computes the optimal primitives composition and demonstrate its effectiveness via in-silico and hardware experiments on an application involving robot navigation in an environment with obstacles. The experiments highlight that Free-Gate enables the robot to navigate to the destination despite only having available simple motor primitives that, individually, could not fulfill the task.

Title: Coordinated vehicle dispatching and charging scheduling for an electric ride-hailing fleet under charging congestion and dynamic prices
Authors: Tai-Yu Ma, Richard D. Connors, Francesco Viti
Abstract: Effective utilization of charging station capacity plays an important role in enhancing the profitability of ride-hailing systems using electric vehicles. Existing studies assume constant energy prices and uncapacitated charging stations or do not explicitly consider vehicle queueing at charging stations, resulting in over-optimistic charging infrastructure utilization. In this study, we develop a dynamic charging scheduling method (named CongestionAware) that anticipates vehicles' energy needs and coordinates their charging operations with real-time energy prices to avoid long waiting time at charging stations and increase the total profit of the system. A sequential mixed integer linear programming model is proposed to devise vehicles' day-ahead charging plans based on their experienced charging waiting times and energy consumption. The obtained charging plans are adapted within the day in response to vehicles' energy needs and charging station congestion. The developed charging policy is tested using NYC yellow taxi data in a Manhattan-like study area with a fleet size of 100 vehicles given the scenarios of 3000 and 4000 customers per day. The computational results show that our CongestionAware policy outperforms different benchmark policies with up to +15.06% profit and +19.16% service rate for 4000 customers per day. Sensitivity analysis is conducted with different system parameters and managerial insights are discussed.

Title: ECG-Byte: A Tokenizer for End-to-End Generative Electrocardiogram Language Modeling
Authors: William Han, Chaojing Duan, Michael A. Rosenberg, Emerson Liu, Ding Zhao
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional versatility across domains, including applications to electrocardiograms (ECGs). A growing body of work focuses on generating text from multi-channeled ECG signals and corresponding textual prompts. Existing approaches often involve a two-stage process: pretraining an ECG-specific encoder with a self-supervised learning (SSL) objective, followed by finetuning an LLM for natural language generation (NLG) using encoder-derived features. However, these methods face two key limitations: inefficiency due to multi-stage training and challenges in interpreting encoder-generated features. To overcome these issues, we propose ECG-Byte, an adapted byte pair encoding (BPE) tokenizer pipeline for autoregressive language modeling of ECGs. ECG-Byte compresses and encodes ECG signals into tokens, enabling direct end-to-end LLM training by combining ECG and text tokens. This approach enhances interpretability, as ECG tokens can be directly mapped back to the original signals. Leveraging ECG-Byte, we achieve competitive NLG performance while training 3 times faster and using just 48\% of the data required by traditional two-stage methods.

Title: Unsupervised Learning in Echo State Networks for Input Reconstruction
Authors: Taiki Yamada, Yuichi Katori, Kantaro Fujiwara
Abstract: Echo state networks (ESNs) are a class of recurrent neural networks in which only the readout layer is trainable, while the recurrent and input layers are fixed. This architectural constraint enables computationally efficient processing of time-series data. Traditionally, the readout layer in ESNs is trained using supervised learning with target outputs. In this study, we focus on input reconstruction (IR), where the readout layer is trained to reconstruct the input time series fed into the ESN. We show that IR can be achieved through unsupervised learning (UL), without access to supervised targets, provided that the ESN parameters are known a priori and satisfy invertibility conditions. This formulation allows applications relying on IR, such as dynamical system replication and noise filtering, to be reformulated within the UL framework via straightforward integration with existing algorithms. Our results suggest that prior knowledge of ESN parameters can reduce reliance on supervision, thereby establishing a new principle: not only by fixing part of the network parameters but also by exploiting their specific values. Furthermore, our UL-based algorithms for input reconstruction and related tasks are suitable for autonomous processing, offering insights into how analogous computational mechanisms might operate in the brain in principle. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the mathematical foundations of ESNs and their relevance to models in computational neuroscience.

Title: OpenEarthSensing: Large-Scale Fine-Grained Benchmark for Open-World Remote Sensing
Authors: Xiang Xiang, Zhuo Xu, Yao Deng, Qinhao Zhou, Yifan Liang, Ke Chen, Qingfang Zheng, Yaowei Wang, Xilin Chen, Wen Gao
Abstract: The advancement of remote sensing, including satellite systems, facilitates the continuous acquisition of remote sensing imagery globally, introducing novel challenges for achieving open-world tasks. Deployed models need to continuously adjust to a constant influx of new data, which frequently exhibits diverse shifts from the data encountered during the training phase. To effectively handle the new data, models are required to detect semantic shifts, adapt to covariate shifts, and continuously update their parameters without forgetting learned knowledge, as has been considered in works on a variety of open-world tasks. However, existing studies are typically conducted within a single dataset to simulate realistic conditions, with a lack of large-scale benchmarks capable of evaluating multiple open-world tasks. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{OpenEarthSensing (OES)}, a large-scale fine-grained benchmark for open-world remote sensing. OES includes 189 scene and object categories, covering the vast majority of potential semantic shifts that may occur in the real world. Additionally, to provide a more comprehensive testbed for evaluating the generalization performance, OES encompasses five data domains with significant covariate shifts, including two RGB satellite domains, one RGB aerial domain, one multispectral RGB domain, and one infrared domain. We evaluate the baselines and existing methods for diverse tasks on OES, demonstrating that it serves as a meaningful and challenging benchmark for open-world remote sensing. The proposed dataset OES is available at this https URL.

Title: Design, Dynamic Modeling and Control of a 2-DOF Robotic Wrist Actuated by Twisted and Coiled Actuators
Authors: Yunsong Zhang, Xinyu Zhou, Feitian Zhang
Abstract: Artificial muscle-driven modular soft robots exhibit significant potential for executing complex tasks. However, their broader applicability remains constrained by the lack of dynamic model-based control strategies tailored for multi-degree-of-freedom (DOF) configurations. This paper presents a novel design of a 2-DOF robotic wrist, envisioned as a fundamental building block for such advanced robotic systems. The wrist module is actuated by twisted and coiled actuators (TCAs) and utilizes a compact 3RRRR parallel mechanism to achieve a lightweight structure with enhanced motion capability. A comprehensive Lagrangian dynamic model is developed to capture the module's complex nonlinear behavior. Leveraging this model, a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) is designed to ensure accurate trajectory tracking. A physical prototype of the robotic wrist is fabricated, and extensive experiments are performed to validate its motion performance and the fidelity of the proposed dynamic model. Subsequently, comparative evaluations between the NMPC and a conventional PID controller are conducted under various operating conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the dynamic model-based control approach in managing the motion of TCA-driven robotic wrists. Finally, to illustrate its practical utility and integrability, the wrist module is incorporated into a multi-segment soft robotic arm, where it successfully executes a trajectory tracking task.

Title: Exploring Textual Semantics Diversity for Image Transmission in Semantic Communication Systems using Visual Language Model
Authors: Peishan Huang, Dong Li
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid development of machine learning has brought reforms and challenges to traditional communication systems. Semantic communication has appeared as an effective strategy to effectively extract relevant semantic signals semantic segmentation labels and image features for image transmission. However, the insufficient number of extracted semantic features of images will potentially result in a low reconstruction accuracy, which hinders the practical applications and still remains challenging for solving. In order to fill this gap, this letter proposes a multi-text transmission semantic communication (Multi-SC) system, which uses the visual language model (VLM) to assist in the transmission of image semantic signals. Unlike previous image transmission semantic communication systems, the proposed system divides the image into multiple blocks and extracts multiple text information from the image using a modified large language and visual assistant (LLaVA), and combines semantic segmentation tags with semantic text for image recovery. Simulation results show that the proposed text semantics diversity scheme can significantly improve the reconstruction accuracy compared with related works.

Title: Text-Driven Voice Conversion via Latent State-Space Modeling
Authors: Wen Li, Sofia Martinez, Priyanka Shah
Abstract: Text-driven voice conversion allows customization of speaker characteristics and prosodic elements using textual descriptions. However, most existing methods rely heavily on direct text-to-speech training, limiting their flexibility in controlling nuanced style elements or timbral features. In this paper, we propose a novel \textbf{Latent State-Space} approach for text-driven voice conversion (\textbf{LSS-VC}). Our method treats each utterance as an evolving dynamical system in a continuous latent space. Drawing inspiration from mamba, which introduced a state-space model for efficient text-driven \emph{image} style transfer, we adapt a loosely related methodology for \emph{voice} style transformation. Specifically, we learn a voice latent manifold where style and content can be manipulated independently by textual style prompts. We propose an adaptive cross-modal fusion mechanism to inject style information into the voice latent representation, enabling interpretable and fine-grained control over speaker identity, speaking rate, and emphasis. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms recent baselines in both subjective and objective quality metrics, while offering smoother transitions between styles, reduced artifacts, and more precise text-based style control.

Title: Quantum Meets SAR: A Novel Range-Doppler Algorithm for Next-Gen Earth Observation
Authors: Khalil Al Salahat, Mohamad El Moussawi, Ali J. Ghandour
Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) plays a vital role in remote sensing due to its ability to capture high-resolution images regardless of weather conditions or daylight. However, to transform the raw SAR signals into interpretable imagery, advanced data processing techniques are essential. A widely used technique for this purpose is the Range Doppler Algorithm (RDA), which takes advantage of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to convert signals into the frequency domain for further processing. However, the computational cost of this approach becomes significant when dealing with large datasets. This paper presents a Quantum Range Doppler Algorithm (QRDA) that utilizes the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) to accelerate processing compared to the classical FFT. Furthermore, it introduces a quantum implementation of the Range Cell Migration Correction (RCMC) in the Fourier domain, a critical step in the RDA pipeline that realigns the received echoes so that the energy from a target is concentrated in a single range bin across all azimuth positions. The performance of the quantum RCMC is evaluated and compared against its classical counterpart, demonstrating the potential of quantum computing in advanced SAR imaging.

Title: BERSting at the Screams: A Benchmark for Distanced, Emotional and Shouted Speech Recognition
Authors: Paige TuttÃ¶sÃ­, Mantaj Dhillon, Luna Sang, Shane Eastwood, Poorvi Bhatia, Quang Minh Dinh, Avni Kapoor, Yewon Jin, Angelica Lim
Abstract: Some speech recognition tasks, such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), are approaching or have reached human performance in many reported metrics. Yet, they continue to struggle in complex, real-world, situations, such as with distanced speech. Previous challenges have released datasets to address the issue of distanced ASR, however, the focus remains primarily on distance, specifically relying on multi-microphone array systems. Here we present the B(asic) E(motion) R(andom phrase) S(hou)t(s) (BERSt) dataset. The dataset contains almost 4 hours of English speech from 98 actors with varying regional and non-native accents. The data was collected on smartphones in the actors homes and therefore includes at least 98 different acoustic environments. The data also includes 7 different emotion prompts and both shouted and spoken utterances. The smartphones were places in 19 different positions, including obstructions and being in a different room than the actor. This data is publicly available for use and can be used to evaluate a variety of speech recognition tasks, including: ASR, shout detection, and speech emotion recognition (SER). We provide initial benchmarks for ASR and SER tasks, and find that ASR degrades both with an increase in distance and shout level and shows varied performance depending on the intended emotion. Our results show that the BERSt dataset is challenging for both ASR and SER tasks and continued work is needed to improve the robustness of such systems for more accurate real-world use.

Title: Distributionally Robust LQG with Kullback-Leibler Ambiguity Sets
Authors: Marta Fochesato, Lucia Falconi, Mattia Zorzi, Augusto Ferrante, John Lygeros
Abstract: The Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller is known to be inherently fragile to model misspecifications common in real-world situations. We consider discrete-time partially observable stochastic linear systems and provide a robustification of the standard LQG against distributional uncertainties on the process and measurement noise. Our distributionally robust formulation specifies the admissible perturbations by defining a relative entropy based ambiguity set individually for each time step along a finite-horizon trajectory, and minimizes the worst-case cost across all admissible distributions. We prove that the optimal control policy is still linear, as in standard LQG, and derive a computational scheme grounded on iterative best response that provably converges to the set of saddle points. Finally, we consider the case of endogenous uncertainty captured via decision-dependent ambiguity sets and we propose an approximation scheme based on dynamic programming.

Title: I Know You're Listening: Adaptive Voice for HRI
Authors: Paige TuttÃ¶sÃ­
Abstract: While the use of social robots for language teaching has been explored, there remains limited work on a task-specific synthesized voices for language teaching robots. Given that language is a verbal task, this gap may have severe consequences for the effectiveness of robots for language teaching tasks. We address this lack of L2 teaching robot voices through three contributions: 1. We address the need for a lightweight and expressive robot voice. Using a fine-tuned version of Matcha-TTS, we use emoji prompting to create an expressive voice that shows a range of expressivity over time. The voice can run in real time with limited compute resources. Through case studies, we found this voice more expressive, socially appropriate, and suitable for long periods of expressive speech, such as storytelling. 2. We explore how to adapt a robot's voice to physical and social ambient environments to deploy our voices in various locations. We found that increasing pitch and pitch rate in noisy and high-energy environments makes the robot's voice appear more appropriate and makes it seem more aware of its current environment. 3. We create an English TTS system with improved clarity for L2 listeners using known linguistic properties of vowels that are difficult for these listeners. We used a data-driven, perception-based approach to understand how L2 speakers use duration cues to interpret challenging words with minimal tense (long) and lax (short) vowels in English. We found that the duration of vowels strongly influences the perception for L2 listeners and created an "L2 clarity mode" for Matcha-TTS that applies a lengthening to tense vowels while leaving lax vowels unchanged. Our clarity mode was found to be more respectful, intelligible, and encouraging than base Matcha-TTS while reducing transcription errors in these challenging tense/lax minimal pairs.

Title: Delay-Doppler Diversity Analysis of ODDM Modulation in Satellite Communication Systems
Authors: Yu Liu, Cunhua Pan, Tantao Gong, Yinlu Wang, Ming Chen
Abstract: Orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM) modulation offers a promising solution to the problem of severe Doppler effects in low earth orbit (LEO) satellites communications. It has been suggested in the recent literature that ODDM modulation can extract full delay-Doppler (DD) diversity, yet a rigorous analysis has not been presented. In this paper, we present a formal analysis of the DD diversity achieved by ODDM modulation along with supporting simulations. Specifically, the analysis and simulations reveal that the asymptotic DD diversity order of ODDM modulation is one, and this order is achieved at lower bit error rate (BER) values for increased frame sizes. We also present low-complexity detector for ODDM modulation based on the Orthogonal approximate message passing (OAMP) algorithm, and show that this detector extracts full DD diversity with the reduced complexity.

Title: BENYO-S2ST-Corpus-1: A Bilingual English-to-Yoruba Direct Speech-to-Speech Translation Corpus
Authors: Emmanuel Adetiba, Abdultaofeek Abayomi, Raymond J. Kala, Ayodele H. Ifijeh, Oluwatobi E. Dare, Olabode Idowu-Bismark, Gabriel O. Sobola, Joy N. Adetiba, Monsurat Adepeju Lateef, Heather Cole-Lewis
Abstract: There is a major shortage of Speech-to-Speech Translation (S2ST) datasets for high resource-to-low resource language pairs such as English-to-Yoruba. Thus, in this study, we curated the Bilingual English-to-Yoruba Speech-to-Speech Translation Corpus Version 1 (BENYO-S2ST-Corpus-1). The corpus is based on a hybrid architecture we developed for large-scale direct S2ST corpus creation at reduced cost. To achieve this, we leveraged non speech-to-speech Standard Yoruba (SY) real-time audios and transcripts in the YORULECT Corpus as well as the corresponding Standard English (SE) transcripts. YORULECT Corpus is small scale(1,504) samples, and it does not have paired English audios. Therefore, we generated the SE audios using pre-trained AI models (i.e. Facebook MMS). We also developed an audio augmentation algorithm named AcoustAug based on three latent acoustic features to generate augmented audios from the raw audios of the two languages. BENYO-S2ST-Corpus-1 has 12,032 audio samples per language, which gives a total of 24,064 sample size. The total audio duration for the two languages is 41.20 hours. This size is quite significant. Beyond building S2ST models, BENYO-S2ST-Corpus-1 can be used to build pretrained models or improve existing ones. The created corpus and Coqui framework were used to build a pretrained Yoruba TTS model (named YoruTTS-1.5) as a proof of concept. The YoruTTS-1.5 gave a F0 RMSE value of 63.54 after 1,000 epochs, which indicates moderate fundamental pitch similarity with the reference real-time audio. Ultimately, the corpus architecture in this study can be leveraged by researchers and developers to curate datasets for multilingual high-resource-to-low-resource African languages. This will bridge the huge digital divides in translations among high and low-resource language pairs. BENYO-S2ST-Corpus-1 and YoruTTS-1.5 are publicly available at (this https URL).

Title: Compression Method for Deep Diagonal State Space Model Based on $H^2$ Optimal Reduction
Authors: Hiroki Sakamoto, Kazuhiro Sato
Abstract: Deep learning models incorporating linear SSMs have gained attention for capturing long-range dependencies in sequential data. However, their large parameter sizes pose challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. In this study, we propose an efficient parameter reduction method for these models by applying $H^{2}$ model order reduction techniques from control theory to their linear SSM components. In experiments, the LRA benchmark results show that the model compression based on our proposed method outperforms an existing method using the Balanced Truncation, while successfully reducing the number of parameters in the SSMs to $1/32$ without sacrificing the performance of the original models.

Title: Spatial Language Likelihood Grounding Network for Bayesian Fusion of Human-Robot Observations
Authors: Supawich Sitdhipol, Waritwong Sukprasongdee, Ekapol Chuangsuwanich, Rina Tse
Abstract: Fusing information from human observations can help robots overcome sensing limitations in collaborative tasks. However, an uncertainty-aware fusion framework requires a grounded likelihood representing the uncertainty of human inputs. This paper presents a Feature Pyramid Likelihood Grounding Network (FP-LGN) that grounds spatial language by learning relevant map image features and their relationships with spatial relation semantics. The model is trained as a probability estimator to capture aleatoric uncertainty in human language using three-stage curriculum learning. Results showed that FP-LGN matched expert-designed rules in mean Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) and demonstrated greater robustness with lower standard deviation. Collaborative sensing results demonstrated that the grounded likelihood successfully enabled uncertainty-aware fusion of heterogeneous human language observations and robot sensor measurements, achieving significant improvements in human-robot collaborative task performance.

Title: The Importance of Facial Features in Vision-based Sign Language Recognition: Eyes, Mouth or Full Face?
Authors: Dinh Nam Pham, Eleftherios Avramidis
Abstract: Non-manual facial features play a crucial role in sign language communication, yet their importance in automatic sign language recognition (ASLR) remains underexplored. While prior studies have shown that incorporating facial features can improve recognition, related work often relies on hand-crafted feature extraction and fails to go beyond the comparison of manual features versus the combination of manual and facial features. In this work, we systematically investigate the contribution of distinct facial regionseyes, mouth, and full faceusing two different deep learning models (a CNN-based model and a transformer-based model) trained on an SLR dataset of isolated signs with randomly selected classes. Through quantitative performance and qualitative saliency map evaluation, we reveal that the mouth is the most important non-manual facial feature, significantly improving accuracy. Our findings highlight the necessity of incorporating facial features in ASLR.

Title: Efficient Pain Recognition via Respiration Signals: A Single Cross-Attention Transformer Multi-Window Fusion Pipeline
Authors: Stefanos Gkikas, Ioannis Kyprakis, Manolis Tsiknakis
Abstract: Pain is a complex condition affecting a large portion of the population. Accurate and consistent evaluation is essential for individuals experiencing pain, and it supports the development of effective and advanced management strategies. Automatic pain assessment systems provide continuous monitoring and support clinical decision-making, aiming to reduce distress and prevent functional decline. This study has been submitted to the \textit{Second Multimodal Sensing Grand Challenge for Next-Gen Pain Assessment (AI4PAIN)}. The proposed method introduces a pipeline that leverages respiration as the input signal and incorporates a highly efficient cross-attention transformer alongside a multi-windowing strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that respiration is a valuable physiological modality for pain assessment. Moreover, experiments revealed that compact and efficient models, when properly optimized, can achieve strong performance, often surpassing larger counterparts. The proposed multi-window approach effectively captures both short-term and long-term features, as well as global characteristics, thereby enhancing the model's representational capacity.
