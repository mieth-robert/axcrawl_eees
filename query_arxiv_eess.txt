Title: Application of Graph Based Vision Transformers Architectures for Accurate Temperature Prediction in Fiber Specklegram Sensors
Authors: Abhishek Sebastian
Abstract: Fiber Specklegram Sensors (FSS) are highly effective for environmental monitoring, particularly for detecting temperature variations. However, the nonlinear nature of specklegram data presents significant challenges for accurate temperature prediction. This study investigates the use of transformer-based architectures, including Vision Transformers (ViTs), Swin Transformers, and emerging models such as Learnable Importance Non-Symmetric Attention Vision Transformers (LINA-ViT) and Multi-Adaptive Proximity Vision Graph Attention Transformers (MAP-ViGAT), to predict temperature from specklegram data over a range of 0 to 120 Celsius. The results show that ViTs achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.15, outperforming traditional models such as CNNs. GAT-ViT and MAP-ViGAT variants also demonstrated competitive accuracy, highlighting the importance of adaptive attention mechanisms and graph-based structures in capturing complex modal interactions and phase shifts in specklegram data. Additionally, this study incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, including attention maps and saliency maps, to provide insights into the decision-making processes of the transformer models, improving interpretability and transparency. These findings establish transformer architectures as strong benchmarks for optical fiber-based temperature sensing and offer promising directions for industrial monitoring and structural health assessment applications.

Title: Fully Differentiable dMRI Streamline Propagation in PyTorch
Authors: Jongyeon Yoon, Elyssa M. McMaster, Michael E. Kim, Gaurav Rudravaram, Kurt G. Schilling, Bennett A. Landman, Daniel Moyer
Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides a distinctive means to probe the microstructural architecture of living tissue, facilitating applications such as brain connectivity analysis, modeling across multiple conditions, and the estimation of macrostructural features. Tractography, which emerged in the final years of the 20th century and accelerated in the early 21st century, is a technique for visualizing white matter pathways in the brain using dMRI. Most diffusion tractography methods rely on procedural streamline propagators or global energy minimization methods. Although recent advancements in deep learning have enabled tasks that were previously challenging, existing tractography approaches are often non-differentiable, limiting their integration in end-to-end learning frameworks. While progress has been made in representing streamlines in differentiable frameworks, no existing method offers fully differentiable propagation. In this work, we propose a fully differentiable solution that retains numerical fidelity with a leading streamline algorithm. The key is that our PyTorch-engineered streamline propagator has no components that block gradient flow, making it fully differentiable. We show that our method matches standard propagators while remaining differentiable. By translating streamline propagation into a differentiable PyTorch framework, we enable deeper integration of tractography into deep learning workflows, laying the foundation for a new category of macrostructural reasoning that is not only computationally robust but also scientifically rigorous.

Title: Ein Fenster zur gleichzeitigen Messung der Uebertragungsfunktion eines realen Systems und des Leistungsdichtespektrums des ueberlagerten Rauschens am Systemausgang (Teil 1)
Authors: Helmut Repp
Abstract: There is already a method known from the literature with which it is possible to measure both the transfer function and the noise power spectral density of the superimposed noise at the output of a disturbed, time-invariant, real system with nonlinearities in one measurement. By using a suitable window, the frequency selectivity of the measurement of the power spectral density of the superimposed noise can be noticeably improved without significantly increasing the computational complexity of the method. The unbiasedness and consistency of the measurement method with a suitable window are proven. The measurement of the power spectral density of a zero-mean, stationary process without measuring the transfer function is investigated as a special case for both real-valued and complex-valued signals. It is derived which requirements a suitable window should meet and how it can be calculated with high numerical accuracy. -- Es gibt bereits eine aus der Literatur bekannte Methode mit der es moeglich ist in einer Messung sowohl die Uebertragungsfunktion als auch das Rauschleistungsdichtespektrum des ueberlagerten Rauschens am Ausgang eines gestoerten, zeitinvarianten, realen Systems mit Nichtlinearitaeten zu messen. Durch den Einsatz eines geeigneten Fensters kann die Frequenzselektivitaet der Messung des Leistungsdichtespektrums der Stoerung deutlich verbessert werden, ohne den Aufwand der Berechnungen des Verfahrens nennenswert zu erhoehen. Die Erwartungstreue und die Konsistenz des Messverfahren mit Fensterung wird gezeigt. Die Messung des Leistungsdichtespektrums eines mittelwertfreien, stationaeren Prozesses ohne Messung der Uebertragungsfunktion wird als Sonderfall sowohl fuer reellwertige, als auch fuer komplexwertige Signale untersucht. Es wird hergeleitet, welche Forderungen ein geeignetes Fenster erfuellen sollte und wie es sich numerisch hochgenau berechnen laesst.

Title: Lightweight Foundation Model for Wireless Time Series Downstream Tasks on Edge Devices
Authors: Mohammad Cheraghinia, Eli De Poorter, Jaron Fontaine, Kwang Soon Kim, Merouane Debbah, Adnan Shahid
Abstract: While machine learning is widely used to optimize wireless networks, training a separate model for each task in communication and localization is becoming increasingly unsustainable due to the significant costs associated with training and deployment. Foundation models offer a more scalable alternative by enabling a single model to be adapted across multiple tasks through fine-tuning with limited samples. However, current foundation models mostly rely on large-scale Transformer architectures, resulting in computationally intensive models unsuitable for deployment on typical edge devices. This paper presents a lightweight foundation model based on simple Multi-Layer-Perceptron (MLP) encoders that independently process input patches. Our model supports 4 types of downstream tasks (long-range technology recognition, short-range technology recognition, modulation recognition and line-of-sight-detection) from multiple input types (IQ and CIR) and different sampling rates. We show that, unlike Transformers, which can exhibit performance drops as downstream tasks are added, our MLP model maintains robust generalization performance, achieving over 97% accurate fine-tuning results for previously unseen data classes. These results are achieved despite having only 21K trainable parameters, allowing an inference time of 0.33 ms on common edge devices, making the model suitable for constrained real-time deployments.

Title: A $μ$-Analysis and Synthesis Framework for Partial Integral Equations using IQCs
Authors: Thijs Lenssen, Aleksandr Talitckii, Matthew Peet, Amritam Das
Abstract: We develop a $\mu$-analysis and synthesis framework for infinite-dimensional systems that leverages the Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQCs) to compute the structured singular value's upper bound. The methodology formulates robust stability and performance conditions jointly as Linear Partial Integral Inequalities within the Partial Integral Equation framework, establishing connections between IQC multipliers and $\mu$-theory. Computational implementation via PIETOOLS enables computational tools that practically applicable to spatially distributed infinite dimensional systems. Illustrations with the help of Partial and Delay Differential Equations validate the effectiveness of the framework, showing a significant reduction in conservatism compared to unstructured methods and providing systematic tools for stability-performance trade-off analysis.

Title: How much can we save? Upper bound cost and emissions benefits from commercial and industrial load flexibility
Authors: Akshay K. Rao, Fletcher T. Chapin, Erin Musabandesu, Adhithyan Sakthivelu, Carson Tucker, Daly Wettermark, Meagan S. Mauter
Abstract: Load shifting by commercial and industrial power consumers reduces costs and Scope 2 emissions for the consumer and the grid. Incentivizing this behavior requires tools for valuing flexibility amidst the heterogeneity in load characteristics across diverse sectors and the spatiotemporal variation in electricity prices and emissions factors. This work presents a top-down approach to screen and broadly understand the benefits of flexibility based on system uptime, power capacity (PC), energy capacity (EC), and round- trip efficiency (RTE). Depending on the region and season, cost savings from flexibility range from 0 to over 100% and emissions savings are generally bounded between 5-40%. We also find the magnitude and cost of emissions abatement from flexibility is highly variable and, in some cases, up to four orders of magnitude less than regional renewable energy credits or common investing or policy benchmarks like the social cost of carbon. While the value of flexibility is highly dynamic, estimating savings as a function of load characteristics and incentives can inform heuristic design of new systems, siting strategies, comparison of flexibility to other decarbonization options, and new avenues for incentivizing flexibility.

Title: Ein Fenster zur gleichzeitigen Messung der Uebertragungsfunktion eines realen Systems und des Leistungsdichtespektrums des ueberlagerten Rauschens am Systemausgang (Teil 2)
Authors: Helmut Repp
Abstract: The method described in the first part for frequency-selectively measuring the transfer function and the noise power spectral density of the superimposed noise at the output of a disturbed, real system with nonlinearities using windowing was limited to time-invariant systems with stationary and zero-mean processes. Here, we investigate how this measurement method can be extended so that all correlations existing between the input and output signals can also be measured using windowing for a periodically time-varying system disturbed by a cyclostationary noise process. An extended version of the window construction algorithm presented in the first part is introduced, in which some degrees of freedom not used there can be used to appropriately influence the properties of the window sequence depending on the application. -- Das im ersten Teil beschriebene Verfahren die Uebertragungsfunktion und das Rauschleistungsdichtespektrum des ueberlagerten Rauschens am Ausgang eines gestoerten, realen Systems mit Nichtlinearitaeten mit Hilfe der Fensterung frequenzselektiv zu vermessen beschraenkte sich auf zeitinvariante Systeme mit stationaeren und mittelwertfreien Prozessen. Hier wird untersucht, wie dieses Messverfahren zu erweitern ist, so dass man damit auch alle Korrelationen, die zwischen Ein- und Ausgangssignal bestehen, bei einem periodisch zeitvarianten System, das von einem zyklostationaeren Rauschprozess gestoert wird, mit einer Fensterung messen kann. Es wird eine erweiterte Variante des im ersten Teil vorgestellten Algorithmus zur Konstruktion des Fensters angegeben, bei der einige dort nicht genutzte Freiheitsgrade dazu verwendet werden koennen, die Eigenschaften der Fensterfolge je nach Applikation geeignet zu beeinflussen.

Title: Quality-Controlled Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations with Identity-Based Transfer Learning and MAMBA Fusion
Authors: Zanxu Wang, Homayoon Beigi
Abstract: This paper addresses data quality issues in multimodal emotion recognition in conversation (MERC) through systematic quality control and multi-stage transfer learning. We implement a quality control pipeline for MELD and IEMOCAP datasets that validates speaker identity, audio-text alignment, and face detection. We leverage transfer learning from speaker and face recognition, assuming that identity-discriminative embeddings capture not only stable acoustic and Facial traits but also person-specific patterns of emotional expression. We employ RecoMadeEasy(R) engines for extracting 512-dimensional speaker and face embeddings, fine-tune MPNet-v2 for emotion-aware text representations, and adapt these features through emotion-specific MLPs trained on unimodal datasets. MAMBA-based trimodal fusion achieves 64.8% accuracy on MELD and 74.3% on IEMOCAP. These results show that combining identity-based audio and visual embeddings with emotion-tuned text representations on a quality-controlled subset of data yields consistent competitive performance for multimodal emotion recognition in conversation and provides a basis for further improvement on challenging, low-frequency emotion classes.

Title: DustNet: A Wireless Network of Ultrasonic Neural Implants
Authors: Jade Pinkenburg, Changuk Lee, Mohammad Meraj Ghanbari, Cem Yalcin, Miguel Montalban, Rikky Muller
Abstract: Spatially distributed peripheral nerve recordings can be used to reconstruct motor intention and improve natural control of prosthetics in patients with limb deficiencies. However, many existing clinical solutions rely on percutaneous wires to access peripheral nerves; these sites are prone to infection and electrode degradation, preventing chronic use. To enable longterm recording of deeply-seated peripheral nerves, this paper presents DustNet: a network of ultrasonically-powered neural recording implants capable of supporting up to 8 simultaneously recording nodes over a single ultrasound link. To enable high throughput multi-implant communication, DustNet implements a time-division multiple-access (TDMA) protocol with up to 16-level amplitude modulation of the ultrasound backscatter that achieves up to 4x higher data rates than traditional on-off keying methods. Each neural implant consists of a 0.7x0.7x0.7 mm^3 piezoceramic transducer, a 10 nF off-chip capacitor, and an IC mounted on a flexible PCB. The implant IC was fabricated in a 28nm CMOS process and occupies an area of 0.43 mm^2. System functionality was verified within FDA power limits at 90mm depth, achieving a maximum data rate of 400 kb/s at 2 MHz ultrasound carrier frequency, with each implant transmitting uplink data at 50 kb/s and dissipating just 7 {\mu}W of power

Title: An Interpretable Federated Learning Control Framework Design for Smart Grid Resilience
Authors: Ibrahim Shahbaz, Eman Hammad, Abdallah Farraj
Abstract: Power systems remain highly vulnerable to disturbances and cyber-attacks, underscoring the need for resilient and adaptive control strategies. In this work, we investigate a data-driven Federated Learning Control (FLC) framework for transient stability resilience under cyber-physical disturbances. The FLC employs interpretable neural controllers based on the Chebyshev Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (ChebyKAN), trained on a shared centralized control policy and deployed for distributed execution. Simulation results on the IEEE 39-bus New England system show that the proposed FLC consistently achieves faster stabilization than distributed baselines at moderate control levels (10\%--60\%), highlighting its potential as a scalable, resilient, and interpretable learning-based control solution for modern power grids.

Title: WiCo-MG: Wireless Channel Foundation Model for Multipath Generation via Synesthesia of Machines
Authors: Zengrui Han, Lu Bai, Xuesong Cai, Xiang Cheng
Abstract: Precise modeling of channel multipath is essential for understanding wireless propagation environments and optimizing communication systems. In particular, sixth-generation (6G) artificial intelligence (AI)-native communication systems demand massive and high-quality multipath channel data to enable intelligent model training and performance optimization. In this paper, we propose a wireless channel foundation model (WiCo) for multipath generation (WiCo-MG) via Synesthesia of Machines (SoM). To provide a solid training foundation for WiCo-MG, a new synthetic intelligent sensing-communication dataset for uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV)-to-ground (U2G) communications is constructed. To overcome the challenges of cross-modal alignment and mapping, a two-stage training framework is proposed. In the first stage, sensing images are embedded into discrete-continuous SoM feature spaces, and multipath maps are embedded into a sensing-initialized discrete SoM space to align the representations. In the second stage, a mixture of shared and routed experts (S-R MoE) Transformer with frequency-aware expert routing learns the mapping from sensing to channel SoM feature spaces, enabling decoupled and adaptive multipath generation. Experimental results demonstrate that WiCo-MG achieves state-of-the-art in-distribution generation performance and superior out-of-distribution generalization, reducing NMSE by more than 2.59 dB over baselines, while exhibiting strong scalability in model and dataset growth and extensibility to new multipath parameters and tasks. Owing to higher accuracy, stronger generalization, and better scalability, WiCo-MG is expected to enable massive and high-fidelity channel data generation for the development of 6G AI-native communication systems.

Title: WiCo-PG: Wireless Channel Foundation Model for Pathloss Map Generation via Synesthesia of Machines
Authors: Mingran Sun, Lu Bai, Ziwei Huang, Xuesong Cai, Xiang Cheng, Jianjun Wu
Abstract: A wireless channel foundation model for pathloss map generation (WiCo-PG) via Synesthesia of Machines (SoM) is developed for the first time. Considering sixth-generation (6G) uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV)-to-ground (U2G) scenarios, a new multi-modal sensing-communication dataset is constructed for WiCo-PG pre-training, including multiple U2G scenarios, diverse flight altitudes, and diverse frequency bands. Based on the constructed dataset, the proposed WiCo-PG enables cross-modal pathloss map generation by leveraging RGB images from different scenarios and flight altitudes. In WiCo-PG, a novel network architecture designed for cross-modal pathloss map generation based on dual vector quantized generative adversarial networks (VQGANs) and Transformer is proposed. Furthermore, a novel frequency-guided shared-routed mixture of experts (S-R MoE) architecture is designed for cross-modal pathloss map generation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed WiCo-PG achieves improved pathloss map generation accuracy through pre-training with a normalized mean squared error (NMSE) of 0.012, outperforming the large language model (LLM)-based scheme, i.e., LLM4PG, and the conventional deep learning-based scheme by more than 6.98 dB. The enhanced generality of the proposed WiCo-PG can further outperform the LLM4PG by at least 1.37 dB using 2.7% samples in few-shot generalization.

Title: Inverse optimal design of input-to-state stabilizing homogeneous controllers for nonlinear homogeneous systems
Authors: Kaixin Lu, Ziliang Lyu, Haoyong Yu
Abstract: This work studies the inverse optimality of input-to-state stabilizing controllers with input-output stability guarantees for nonlinear homogeneous systems. We formulate a new inverse optimal control problem, where the cost functional incorporates penalties on the output, in addition to the state, control and disturbance as in current related works. One benefit of penalizing the output is that the resulting inverse optimal controllers can ensure both input-to-state stability and input-output stability. We propose a technique for constructing the corresponding meaningful cost functional by using homogeneity properties, and provide sufficient conditions on solving the inverse optimal gain assignment problem. We show that homogeneous stabilizability of homogeneous systems in the case without disturbance is sufficient for the solvability of inverse optimal gain assignment problem for homogeneous systems.

Title: Image Denoising Using Transformed L1 (TL1) Regularization via ADMM
Authors: Nabiha Choudhury, Jianqing Jia, Yifei Lou
Abstract: Total variation (TV) regularization is a classical tool for image denoising, but its convex $\ell_1$ formulation often leads to staircase artifacts and loss of contrast. To address these issues, we introduce the Transformed $\ell_1$ (TL1) regularizer applied to image gradients. In particular, we develop a TL1-regularized denoising model and solve it using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), featuring a closed-form TL1 proximal operator and an FFT-based image update under periodic boundary conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior denoising performance, effectively suppressing noise while preserving edges and enhancing image contrast.

Title: The Triple-C Paradigm: Cooperative, Complementary, and Competitive Modes for TBS-HAPS-LEO Integration
Authors: Eros Kuikel, Sidrah Javed, Baha Eddine Youcef Belmekki, Yunfei Chen, Ning Wang, Mohamed-Slim Alouini
Abstract: The growing demands of ubiquitous and resilient global coverage have pushed existing networks to their operational limits, making it increasingly difficult to meet all requirements on their own. Integrating \emph{Terrestrial Base Stations (TBS), High Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS)} and \emph{Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO)} satellites is envisioned as a promising solution, yet the coordination across these heterogeneous platforms remains an open challenge. This paper proposes a novel unifying \emph{Triple-C framework: Cooperation, Complementarity, and Competition}, that systematically defines the TBS-HAPS-LEO interaction to deliver seamless resilient and scalable connectivity. For each C, we detail the architectural methodology, required pre-requisites, and measurable deliverables that govern when and how the three layers should collaborate, complement each other, or contend. We further identify the enabling technologies across physical, logical, and cognitive layers to operationalize the proposed 3C paradigm. A rich portfolio of use cases and targeted applications demonstrates how this technological leap will make such integration both feasible and impactful. Comprehensive performance analysis and emulation results quantify the trade-offs of such integrated networks. In addition, we examine the economical, environmental, safety, privacy, standardization, and regulatory implications that shape the real-world implementation of the proposed framework. eventually, we provide the gap analysis, outline key technical/non-technical challenges, and a road-map of future research directions needed to unlock the full potential of Cooperation, Complementarity, and Competition operations in TBS-HAPS-LEO integrated networks.

Title: Enhancing Physical Layer Security in MIMO Systems Assisted by Beyond-Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces
Authors: Weijie Xiong, Jingran Lin, Cunhua Pan, Yilong Zeng, Qiang Li
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) hold significant promise for enhancing physical layer security (PLS). However, conventional RISs are typically modeled using diagonal scattering matrices, capturing only independent reflections from each reflecting element, which limits their flexibility in channel manipulation. In contrast, beyond-diagonal RISs (BD-RISs) employ non-diagonal scattering matrices enabled by active and tunable inter-element connections through a shared impedance network. This architecture significantly enhances channel shaping capabilities, creating new opportunities for advanced PLS techniques. This paper investigates PLS in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system assisted by BD-RISs, where a multi-antenna transmitter sends confidential information to a multi-antenna legitimate user while a multi-antenna eavesdropper attempts interception. To maximize the secrecy rate (SR), we formulate it as a non-convex optimization problem by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and BD-RIS REs under power and structural constraints. To solve this problem, we first introduce an auxiliary variable to decouple BD-RIS constraints. We then propose a low-complexity penalty product Riemannian conjugate gradient descent (P-PRCGD) method, which combines the augmented Lagrangian (AL) approach with the product manifold gradient descent (PMGD) method to obtain a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution. Simulation results confirm that BD-RIS-assisted systems significantly outperform conventional RIS-assisted systems in PLS performance.

Title: Constant-Modulus Secure Analog Beamforming for an IRS-Assisted Communication System with Large-Scale Antenna Array
Authors: Weijie Xiong, Jingran Lin, Zhiling Xiao, Qiang Li
Abstract: Physical layer security (PLS) is an important technology in wireless communication systems to safeguard communication privacy and security between transmitters and legitimate users. The integration of large-scale antenna arrays (LSAA) and intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance PLS. However, LSAA requires a dedicated radio frequency (RF) chain for each antenna element, and IRS comprises hundreds of reflecting micro-antennas, leading to increased hardware costs and power consumption. To address this, cost-effective solutions like constant modulus analog beamforming (CMAB) have gained attention. This paper investigates PLS in IRS-assisted communication systems with a focus on jointly designing the CMAB at the transmitter and phase shifts at the IRS to maximize the secrecy rate. The resulting secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem is non-convex. To solve the problem efficiently, we propose two algorithms: (1) the time-efficient Dinkelbach-BSUM algorithm, which reformulates the fractional problem into a series of quadratic programs using the Dinkelbach method and solves them via block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM), and (2) the product manifold conjugate gradient descent (PMCGD) algorithm, which provides a better solution at the cost of slightly higher computational time by transforming the problem into an unconstrained optimization on a Riemannian product manifold and solving it using the conjugate gradient descent (CGD) algorithm. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and highlight their distinct advantages.

Title: Joint Analog Beamforming and Antenna Position Design for Secure Communication systems With Movable Antennas
Authors: Weijie Xiong, Kai Zhong, Zhiling Xiao, Jingran Lin, Qiang Li
Abstract: Movable antennas (MA) are a novel technology that allows for the flexible adjustment of antenna positions within a specified region, thereby enhancing the performance of wireless communication systems. In this paper, we explore the use of MA to improve physical layer security in an analog beamforming (AB) communication system. Our goal is to maximize the secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the transmit AB and MA position, subject to constant modulus (CM) constraints on the AB and position constraints for the MA. The resulting problem is non-convex, and we propose a penalty product manifold (PPM) method to solve it efficiently. Specifically, we convert the inequality constraints related to MA position into a penalty function using smoothing techniques, thereby reformulating the problem as an unconstrained optimization on the product manifold space (PMS). We then derive a parallel conjugate gradient descent (PCGD) algorithm to update both the AB and MA position on the PMS. This method is efficient, providing an analytical solution at each step and ensuring convergence to a KKT point. Simulation results show that the MA system achieves a higher secrecy rate than systems with fixed-position antennas.

Title: Position Optimization for Two-layer Movable Antenna Systems
Authors: Liujia Yao, Changsheng You, Chao Zhou, Beixiong Zheng, Weidong Mei
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) is a promising technology for improving the performance of wireless communication systems by providing new degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) in antenna position optimization. However, existing works on MA systems have mostly considered element-wise single-layer MA (SL-MA) arrays, where all the MAs move within the given movable region, hence inevitably incurring high control complexity and hardware cost in practice. To address this issue, we propose in this letter a new two-layer MA array (TL-MA), where the positions of MAs are jointly determined by the large-scale movement of multiple subarrays and the small-scale fine-tuning of per-subarray MAs. In particular, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum-rate of the TL-MA-aided communication system by jointly optimizing the subarray-positions, per-subarray (relative) MA positions, and receive beamforming. To solve this non-convex problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO)-based particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, which alternately optimizes the positions of subarrays and per-subarray MAs, given the optimal receive beamforming. Numerical results verify that the proposed TL-MA significantly reduces the sum-displacement of MA motors (i.e., the total moving distances of all motors) of element-wise SL-MA, while achieving comparable rate performance.

Title: Nonholonomic Robot Parking by Feedback -- Part I: Modular Strict CLF Designs
Authors: Velimir Todorovski, Kwang Hak Kim, Alessandro Astolfi, Miroslav Krstic
Abstract: It has been known in the robotics literature since about 1995 that, in polar coordinates, the nonholonomic unicycle is asymptotically stabilizable by smooth feedback, even globally. We introduce a modular design framework that selects the forward velocity to decouple the radial coordinate, allowing the steering subsystem to be stabilized independently. Within this structure, we develop families of feedback laws using passivity, backstepping, and integrator forwarding. Each law is accompanied by a strict control Lyapunov function, including barrier variants that enforce angular constraints. These strict CLFs provide constructive class KL convergence estimates and enable eigenvalue assignment at the target equilibrium. The framework generalizes and extends prior modular and nonmodular approaches, while preparing the ground for inverse optimal and adaptive redesigns in the sequel paper.

Title: CASTELLA: Long Audio Dataset with Captions and Temporal Boundaries
Authors: Hokuto Munakata, Takehiro Imamura, Taichi Nishimura, Tatsuya Komatsu
Abstract: We introduce CASTELLA, a human-annotated audio benchmark for the task of audio moment retrieval (AMR). Although AMR has various useful potential applications, there is still no established benchmark with real-world data. The early study of AMR trained the model with solely synthetic datasets. Moreover, the evaluation is based on annotated dataset of fewer than 100 samples. This resulted in less reliable reported performance. To ensure performance for applications in real-world environments, we present CASTELLA, a large-scale manually annotated AMR dataset. CASTELLA consists of 1,009, 213, and 640 audio recordings for train, valid, and test split, respectively, which is 24 times larger than the previous dataset. We also establish a baseline model for AMR using CASTELLA. Our experiments demonstrate that a model fine-tuned on CASTELLA after pre-training on the synthetic data outperformed a model trained solely on the synthetic data by 10.4 points in Recall1@0.7. CASTELLA is publicly available in this https URL.

Title: Auden-Voice: General-Purpose Voice Encoder for Speech and Language Understanding
Authors: Mingyue Huo, Wei-Cheng Tseng, Yiwen Shao, Hao Zhang, Dong Yu
Abstract: Human voice encodes both identity and paralinguistic cues, yet encoders in large audio-language models (LALMs) rarely balance both aspects. In this work, we present a study toward building a general-purpose voice encoder that captures nuanced voice cues. Through a comprehensive evaluation, we find that multi-task training yields the most balanced representations, whereas contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) primarily improves retrieval without enhancing paralinguistic understanding. Our final encoder, Auden-Voice, also demonstrates strong performance when integrated with LLMs. The code and training recipes will be released with the audio understanding toolkit Auden.

Title: Multimodal Wireless Foundation Models
Authors: Ahmed Aboulfotouh, Hatem Abou-Zeid
Abstract: Wireless foundation models (WFMs) have recently demonstrated promising capabilities, jointly performing multiple wireless functions and adapting effectively to new environments. However, while current WFMs process only one modality, depending on the task and operating conditions, the most informative modality changes and no single modality is best for all tasks. WFMs should therefore be designed to accept multiple modalities to enable a broader and more diverse range of tasks and scenarios. In this work, we propose and build the first multimodal wireless foundation model capable of processing both raw IQ streams and image-like wireless modalities (e.g., spectrograms and CSI) and performing multiple tasks across both. We introduce masked wireless modeling for the multimodal setting, a self-supervised objective and pretraining recipe that learns a joint representation from IQ streams and image-like wireless modalities. We evaluate the model on five tasks across both modality families: image-based (human activity sensing, RF signal classification, 5G NR positioning) and IQ-based (RF device fingerprinting, interference detection/classification). The multimodal WFM is competitive with single-modality WFMs, and in several cases surpasses their performance. Our results demonstrates the strong potential of developing multimodal WFMs that support diverse wireless tasks across different modalities. We believe this provides a concrete step toward both AI-native 6G and the vision of joint sensing, communication, and localization.

Title: Spectrum and Orthogonality of Orthogonal Delay-Doppler Division Multiplexing Modulation Waveforms
Authors: Akram Shafie, Jun Tong, Jinhong Yuan, Taka Sakurai, Paul Fitzpatrick, Yuting Fang, Yixuan Xie
Abstract: Orthogonal delay-Doppler (DD) division multiplexing (ODDM) modulation has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for ensuring reliable communications in doubly-selective channels. This work investigates the spectra and orthogonality characteristics of analog (direct) and approximate digital implementations of ODDM systems. We first determine the time and frequency domain representations of the basis functions for waveform in analog and approximate digital ODDM systems. Thereafter, we derive their power spectral densities and show that while the spectrum of analog ODDM waveforms exhibits a step-wise behavior in its transition regions, the spectrum of approximate digital ODDM waveforms is confined to that of the ODDM sub-pulse. Next, we prove the orthogonality characteristics of approximate digital ODDM waveforms and show that, unlike analog ODDM waveforms, the approximate digital ODDM waveforms satisfy orthogonality without the need of additional time domain resources. Additionally, we examine the similarities and differences that implementations of approximate digital ODDM share with the other variants of DD modulations, focusing on the domain changes the symbols undergo, the type of pulse shaping and windowing used, and the domains and the sequence in which they are performed. Finally, we present numerical results to validate our findings and draw further insights.

Title: Theoretical Bounds on Parallel Imaging Implicit Data Crimes in an MRI Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space
Authors: Evan Frenklak, Yamin Arefeen, Jonathan I Tamir
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) diagnoses and manages a wide range of diseases, yet long scan times drive high costs and limit accessibility. AI methods have demonstrated substantial potential for reducing scan times, but despite rapid progress, clinical translation of AI often fails. One particular class of failure modes, referred to as implicit data crimes, are a result of hidden biases introduced when MRI datasets incompletely model the MRI physics of the acquisition. Previous work identified data crimes resulting from algorithmic completion of k-space with parallel imaging and drew on simulation to demonstrate the resulting downstream biases. This work proposes a mathematical framework to re-characterize the problem as one of error reduction during interpolation between sets of evaluation coordinates. We establish a generalized matrix-based definition of the reconstruction error upper bound as a function of the input sampling pattern. Experiments on relevant sampling pattern structures demonstrate the relevance of the framework and suggest future directions for analysis of data crimes.

Title: Space-Time-Frequency Synthetic Integrated Sensing and Communication Networks
Authors: Henglin Pu, Xuefeng Wang, Lu Su, Husheng Li
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) promises high spectral and power efficiencies by sharing waveforms, spectrum, and hardware across sensing and data links. Yet commercial cellular networks struggle to deliver fine angular, range, and Doppler resolution due to limited aperture, bandwidth, and coherent observation time. In this paper, we propose a space-time-frequency synthetic ISAC architecture that fuses observations from distributed transmitters and receivers across time intervals and frequency bands. We develop a unified signal model for multistatic and monostatic configurations, derive Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for the estimations of position and velocity. The analysis shows how spatial diversity, multiband operation, and observation scheduling impact the Fisher information. We also compare the estimation performance between a concentrated maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and a two stage information fusion (TSIF) method that first estimates per-path delay and radial speed and then fuses them by solving a weighted nonlinear least-squares problem via the Gauss-Newton algorithm. Numerical results show that MLE approaches the CRLB in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, while the two stage method remains competitive at moderate to high SNR but degrades at low SNR. A central finding is that fully synthesized network processing is essential, as estimations by individual base stations (BSs) followed by fusion are consistently inferior and unstable at low SNR. This framework offers a practical guidance for upgrading existing communication infrastructure into dense sensing networks.

Title: Nonholonomic Robot Parking by Feedback -- Part II: Nonmodular, Inverse Optimal, Adaptive, Prescribed/Fixed-Time and Safe Designs
Authors: Kwang Hak Kim, Velimir Todorovski, Miroslav Krstić
Abstract: For the unicycle system, we provide constructive methods for the design of feedback laws that have one or more of the following properties: being nonmodular and globally exponentially stabilizing, inverse optimal, robust to arbitrary decrease or increase of input coefficients, adaptive, prescribed/fixed-time stabilizing, and safe (ensuring the satisfaction of state constraints). Our nonmodular backstepping feedbacks are implementable with either unidirectional or bidirectional velocity actuation. Thanks to constructing families of strict CLFs for the unicycle, we introduce a general design framework and families of feedback laws for the unicycle, which are inverse optimal with respect to meaningful costs. These inverse optimal feedback laws are endowed with robustness to actuator uncertainty and arbitrarily low input saturation due to the unicycle's driftlessness. Besides ensuring robustness to unknown input coefficients, we also develop adaptive laws for these unknown coefficients, enabling the achievement of good transient performance with lower initial control effort. Additionally, we develop controllers that achieve stabilization within a user-specified time horizon using two systematic methods: time-dilated prescribed-time design with smooth-in-time convergence to zero of both the states and the inputs and homogeneity-based fixed-time control that provides an explicit bound on the settling time. Finally, with a nonovershooting design we guarantee strictly forward motion without curb violation. This article, along with its Part I, lays a broad constructive design foundation for stabilization of the nonholonomic unicycle.

Title: Theoretical and Empirical Study of Spatial Power Focusing Effect for Sparse Arrays at Terahertz Band
Authors: Yongchao He, Taihao Zhang, Cunhua Pan, Hong Ren, Xianzhe Chen, Tian Qiu, Bingchang Hua, Jiangzhou Wang
Abstract: This work investigates the spatial power focusing effect for large-scale sparse arrays at terahertz (THz) band, combining theoretical analysis with experimental validation. Specifically, based on a Green's function channel model, we analyze the power distribution along the $z$-axis, deriving a closed-form expression to characterize the focusing effect. Furthermore, the factors influencing the focusing effect, including phase noise and positional deviations, are theoretically analyzed and numerically simulated. Finally, a 300 GHz measurement platform based on a vector network analyzer (VNA) is constructed for experimental validation. The measurement results demonstrate close consistence with theoretical simulation results, confirming the spatial power focusing effect for sparse arrays.

Title: Computing Sound and Accurate Upper and Lower Bounds on Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Value Functions
Authors: Ihab Tabbara, Eliya Badr, Hussein Sibai
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a fundamental tool for safety verification and control synthesis for nonlinear-control systems. Classical HJ reachability analysis methods discretize the continuous state space and solve the HJ partial differential equation over a grid, but these approaches do not account for discretization errors and can under-approximate backward reachable sets, which represent unsafe sets of states. We present a framework for computing sound upper and lower bounds on the HJ value functions via value iteration over grids. Additionally, we develop a refinement algorithm that splits cells that were not possible to classify as safe or unsafe given the computed bounds. This algorithm enables computing accurate over-approximations of backward reachable sets even when starting from coarse grids. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our method in two case studies.

Title: Transient Stability Analysis of Grid-Forming Converters with Current Limiting Considering Asymmetrical Grid Faults
Authors: Seongyeon Kim, Ki-Hyun Kim, Shenghui Cui, Jae-Jung Jung
Abstract: Under asymmetrical faults, analyzing the transient stability of grid-forming voltage-source converters (GFM-VSCs) becomes essential because their behavior fundamentally differs from that under symmetrical faults. When current limiting is activated under asymmetrical faults, the point-of-common-coupling voltage of a GFM-VSC contains both positive- and negative-sequence components, and the interaction between these components generates a non-negligible negative-sequence-driven active power. However, the transient stability of GFM-VSCs under asymmetrical faults has not been sufficiently investigated, and the influence of negative-sequence-driven active power remains unclear. Accordingly, this letter derives the P-{\delta} curve of a GFM-VSC with an elliptical current limiter under asymmetrical faults by explicitly accounting for negative-sequence effects. This enables a more accurate transient stability assessment when extending conventional symmetrical-fault analyses to asymmetrical conditions. The theoretical analysis is validated by the agreement between the derived P-{\delta} curve and both simulation and experimental results.

Title: Formulation and Experimental Validation of Price-Based Control of Flexible Prosumers in Distribution Grids with the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
Authors: Plouton Grammatikos, Ali Mohamed Ali, Fabrizio Sossan
Abstract: This paper describes a method for computing price signals for prosumers, incentivizing them to adjust their consumption according to the constraints of the distribution grids to which they are connected, thereby preventing voltage violations and line congestion. The proposed method leverages an interpretation of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), which enables the extraction of a price signal to coordinate the operations of prosumers and the distribution grid's constraints while limiting the sharing of sensitive information among them. The method can be used by Distribution System Operators (DSOs) to dynamically adjust a pre-existing retail electricity tariff (e.g., a constant or time-of-use tariff), thereby triggering grid-support actions from prosumers. The method is validated experimentally in a 9-node low-voltage distribution grid laboratory with real components (lines and controllable power converters). The experiments validate the algorithm's performance in terms of convergence and operational efficiency, demonstrating its viability in a real-life setting.

Title: Techno-Economic Modelling and Component Sizing in Renewable Energy Communities: A Participant Perspective
Authors: Vishal Kachhad, Amit Joshi, Luigi Glielmo
Abstract: This article proposes an optimization problem formulation to find the optimal sizes of Photovoltaics (PV) and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) for individual participants within the context of the Renewable Energy Community (REC). An optimization problem considered the dynamic nature of electricity pricing, solar irradiation levels, financial aspects such as capital investment, and operational and maintenance expenditures of PV and BESS. The analysis also considered replacement costs and the efficiency of charging and discharging the BESS unit. We employed Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) to determine the optimal system size that maximizes the Net Present Value (NPV) of individual participants. Furthermore, in this study, we used daily representative signals for each season of the year to reduce simulation runtime. The Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) was used to extract these signals. Then, these representative signals obtained were used in the optimization problem formulation to reduce simulation time and extend our analysis to a wider planning horizon. In addition, the study introduced fairness by applying the individual marginal contribution method to distribute incentives equitably among REC participants, ensuring that each member benefited from their contribution. A simulation study was conducted using a real demand dataset of five houses located in Roseto Valfortore, a small town and commune in the Foggia Province of the Apulia region in southern Italy, to demonstrate the practical relevance and usefulness of the ideas discussed. Ultimately, the goal of the article was to empower the REC with the knowledge necessary to make informed decisions and shape the future of sustainable energy.

Title: Spatially Consistent Air-to-Ground Channel Modeling and Simulation via 3D Shadow Projections
Authors: Evgenii Vinogradov, Aymen Fakhreddine, Abdul Saboor, Sergi Abadal, Sofie Pollin
Abstract: We present an approach for spatially-consistent semi-deterministic Air-to-Ground (A2G) channel modeling in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-assisted networks. We use efficient 3D building shadow projections to determine Line-of-Sight (LOS) regions, enabling fast generation of LOS maps. By integrating LOS-aware deterministic path loss with stochastic shadow fading, the approach produces spatially consistent A2G radio maps suitable for environment- and mobility-aware channel evaluation and performance prediction. Simulation results in ITU-compliant Manhattan grid environments demonstrate the model's ability to reflect key urban propagation characteristics, such as LOS blockage patterns and outage behavior. The proposed approach provides an efficient alternative to ray tracing or fully stochastic models, with particular relevance for user mobility, link planning, and radio map generation in 6G non-terrestrial networks.

Title: Enabling NLOS Imaging Capabilities at the Initial Access of 6G Base Stations
Authors: Davide Tornielli Bellini, Dario Tagliaferri, Pietro Grassi, Davide Scazzoli, Stefano Tebaldini, Umberto Spagnolini
Abstract: Sensing in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) is one of the major challenges for integrated sensing and communication systems. Existing countermeasures for NLOS either use prior knowledge on the environment to characterize all the multiple bounces or deploy anomalous reflectors in the environment to enable communication infrastructure to ''\textit{see behind the corner}''. This work addresses the integration of monostatic NLOS imaging functionalities into the initial access (IA) procedure of a next generation base station (BS), by means of a non-reconfigurable modular reflector. During standard-compliant IA, the BS sweeps a narrow beam using a pre-defined dedicated codebook to achieve the beam alignment with users. We introduce the imaging functionality by enhancing such codebook with imaging-specific entries that are jointly designed with the angular configuration of the modular reflector to enable high-resolution imaging of a region in NLOS by \textit{coherently} processing all the echoes at the BS. We derive closed-form expressions for the near-field (NF) spatial resolution, as well as for the \textit{effective aperture} (i.e., the portion of the reflector that actively contributes to improve image resolution). The problem of imaging of moving targets in NLOS is also addressed, and we propose a maximum-likelihood estimation for target's velocity in NF and related theoretical bound. Further, we discuss and quantify the inherent communication-imaging performance trade-offs and related system design challenges through numerical simulations. Finally, the proposed imaging method employing modular reflectors is validated both numerically and experimentally, showing the effectiveness of our concept.

Title: Pinching-Antenna System-Assisted Localization: A Stochastic Geometry Perspective
Authors: Jiajun He, Xidong Mu, Hien Quoc Ngo, Michail Matthaiou
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel localization framework underpinned by a pinching-antenna (PA) system, in which the target location is estimated using received signal strength (RSS) measurements obtained from downlink signals transmitted by the PAs. To develop a comprehensive analytical framework, we employ stochastic geometry to model the spatial distribution of the PAs, enabling tractable and insightful network-level performance analysis. Closed-form expressions for target localizability and the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) distribution are analytically derived, enabling the evaluation of the fundamental limits of PA-assisted localization systems without extensive simulations. Furthermore, the proposed framework provides practical guidance for selecting the optimal waveguide number to maximize localization performance. Numerical results also highlight the superiority of the PA-assisted approach over conventional fixed-antenna systems in terms of the CRLB.

Title: Division-based Receiver-agnostic RFF Identification in WiFi Systems
Authors: Xuan Yang, Dongming Li, Dong Wei, Meng Zhang
Abstract: In physical-layer security schemes, radio frequency fingerprint (RFF) identification of WiFi devices is susceptible to receiver differences, which can significantly degrade classification performance when a model is trained on one receiver but tested on another. In this paper, we propose a division-based receiver-agnostic RFF extraction method for WiFi systems, which removes the receivers' effects by dividing different preambles in the frequency domain. The proposed method requires only a single receiver for training and does not rely on additional calibration or stacking processes. First, for flat fading channel scenarios, the legacy short training field (L-STF) and legacy long training field (L-LTF) of the unknown device are divided by those of the reference device in the frequency domain. The receiver-dependent effects can be eliminated with the requirement of only a single receiver for training, and the higher-dimensional RFF features can be extracted. Second, for frequency-selective fading channel scenarios, the high-throughput long training field (HT-LTF) is divided by the L-LTF in the frequency domain. Only a single receiver is required for training and the higher-dimensional RFF features that are both channel-invariant and receiver-agnostic are extracted. Finally, simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively mitigate the impacts of channel variations and receiver differences. The classification results show that, even when training on a single receiver and testing on a different one, the proposed method achieves classification accuracy improvements of 15.5% and 28.45% over the state-of-the-art approach in flat fading and frequency-selective fading channel scenarios, respectively.

Title: On the Contraction of Excitable Systems
Authors: Alessandro Cecconi, Michelangelo Bin, Lorenzo Marconi, Rodolphe Sepulchre
Abstract: We analyze contraction in conductance-based excitable systems and link it to reliable spike timing. For a Hodgkin-Huxley neuron with synaptic input, we prove the unforced dynamics is incrementally exponentially stable on a compact physiological set. With impulsive inputs, contraction persists under an average dwell-time condition, and for periodic spike trains we derive an explicit lower bound on the inter-impulse period. In the high-rate limit the synapse is effectively held open, the conductance is nearly constant, and self-sustained limit-cycle oscillations can arise, so contraction no longer holds. This continuous-time view explains when spike times extracted by an event detector remain robust across trials, and simulations confirm both regimes.

Title: Robust H-infinity control and worst-case search in constrained parametric space
Authors: Ervan Kassarian, Francesco Sanfedino, Daniel Alazard, Andrea Marrazza
Abstract: Standard H-infinity/H2 robust control and analysis tools operate on uncertain parameters assumed to vary independently within prescribed bounds. This paper extends their capabilities in the presence of constraints coupling these parameters and restricting the parametric space. Focusing on the worst-case search, we demonstrate -- based on the theory of upper-C1 functions -- the validity of using standard, readily available smooth optimization algorithms to address this nonsmooth constrained optimization problem. Accordingly, we propose to explore the parametric space with either Monte-Carlo sampling or particle swarm optimization, and to subsequently perform local exploitation with Sequential Quadratic Programming to compute Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points. This worst-case search then enables robust controller synthesis: as in the state-of-art algorithm for standard robust control, identified worst-case configurations are iteratively added to an active set on which a non-smooth multi-models optimization of the controller is performed. The methodology is illustrated on a satellite benchmark with flexible appendages, of order 50 with 43 uncertain parameters. We show that the proposed method largely outperforms Monte-Carlo sampling alone, is able to reliably detect even rare worst-case configurations in minutes on a standard laptop, and that the robust controller optimization converges with less than 10 active configurations. Even in the unconstrained case, the proposed framework complements traditional methods, as it scales to plants with many parameters and states and explores the entire parametric space, albeit without formal guarantees of global optimality.

Title: Collision Resolution in RFID Systems Using Antenna Arrays and Mix Source Separation
Authors: Mohamed Siala, Noura Sellami
Abstract: In this letter, we propose an efficient mix source separation algorithm for collision resolution in radio frequency identification (RFID) systems equipped with an antenna array at the reader. We first introduce an approach that exploits the zero constant modulus (ZCM) criterion to separate colliding tags through gradient descent, without using pilot symbols. We show that the ZCM characteristic, considered alone, in the design of the objective function can lead to significant ambiguities in the determination of the beamformers used in the recovery of tag messages. To address this limitation, we propose a more sophisticated approach, relying on a hybrid objective function, incorporating a new ambiguity-raising criterion in addition to the ZCM criterion.

Title: A Review of Machine Learning for Cavitation Intensity Recognition in Complex Industrial Systems
Authors: Yu Sha, Ningtao Liu, Haofeng Liu, Junqi Tao, Zhenxing Niu, Guojun Huang, Yao Yao, Jiaqi Liang, Moxian Qian, Horst Stoecker, Domagoj Vnucec, Andreas Widl, Kai Zhou
Abstract: Cavitation intensity recognition (CIR) is a critical technology for detecting and evaluating cavitation phenomena in hydraulic machinery, with significant implications for operational safety, performance optimization, and maintenance cost reduction in complex industrial systems. Despite substantial research progress, a comprehensive review that systematically traces the development trajectory and provides explicit guidance for future research is still lacking. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a thorough review and analysis of hundreds of publications on intelligent CIR across various types of mechanical equipment from 2002 to 2025, summarizing its technological evolution and offering insights for future development. The early stages are dominated by traditional machine learning approaches that relied on manually engineered features under the guidance of domain expert knowledge. The advent of deep learning has driven the development of end-to-end models capable of automatically extracting features from multi-source signals, thereby significantly improving recognition performance and robustness. Recently, physical informed diagnostic models have been proposed to embed domain knowledge into deep learning models, which can enhance interpretability and cross-condition generalization. In the future, transfer learning, multi-modal fusion, lightweight network architectures, and the deployment of industrial agents are expected to propel CIR technology into a new stage, addressing challenges in multi-source data acquisition, standardized evaluation, and industrial implementation. The paper aims to systematically outline the evolution of CIR technology and highlight the emerging trend of integrating deep learning with physical knowledge. This provides a significant reference for researchers and practitioners in the field of intelligent cavitation diagnosis in complex industrial systems.

Title: Multimodal Optical Imaging Platform for Quantitative Burn Assessment
Authors: Nathaniel Hanson, Mateusz Wolak, Jonathan Richardson, Patrick Walker, David M. Burmeister, Chakameh Jafari
Abstract: Accurate assessment of burn severity at injury onset remains a major clinical challenge due to the lack of objective methods for detecting subsurface tissue damage. This limitation is critical in battlefield and mass-casualty settings, where rapid and reliable evaluation of burn depth is essential for triage and surgical decision-making. We present a multimodal optical imaging framework that establishes the foundation for a compact, low-size, weight, and power (low-SWaP) field-deployable device for quantitative burn assessment. The system integrates broadband hyperspectral imaging (VSWIR, 400 -- 2100 nm) with laser speckle contrast imaging to jointly evaluate biochemical composition and microvascular perfusion. Using short-wave infrared (SWIR, >1000 nm) wavelengths, we developed and validated novel deep-tissue parameters linked to water, lipid, and collagen absorption features that enhance burn-tissue separability and burn severity classification. We implemented and validated unsupervised learning methods for spectral feature extraction, band down-selection, and clustering against histology, establishing a foundation for a rugged, data-driven device for early quantitative burn evaluation in austere environments.

Title: Randomized Power Transmission with Optimized Level Selection Probabilities in Uncoordinated Uplink NOMA
Authors: Noura Sellami, Mohamed Siala
Abstract: We consider uncoordinated random uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems using a set of predetermined power levels. We propose to optimize the probabilities of selection of power levels in order to minimize performance metrics as block error probability (BLEP) or bit error probability (BEP). When the multiuser detection algorithm at the BS treats at most two colliding users' packets, our optimization problem is a quadratic programming problem. For more colliding users' packets, we solve the problem iteratively. Our solution is original because it applies to any multiuser detection algorithm and any set of power levels.

Title: Uncoordinated Cooperative OFDM Multi-Hop UAV Relay Networks Using Virtual Channels Based on All-Pass Filters
Authors: Noura Sellami, Mohamed Siala
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient transmission scheme for autonomous cooperative Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) based multi-hop Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) relay networks. These systems often suffer from destructive interference at the destination node due to uncoordinated transmissions of common packets by cooperating UAVs. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of virtual transmit channels at each UAV, implemented using truncated all-pass filters (APFs). This approach ensures that all subcarriers benefit from comparable transmit powers, guaranteeing excellent performance when a single UAV is transmitting. In scenarios where multiple UAVs cooperate without coordination, the inherent randomness of the generated virtual channels facilitates cooperative diversity, effectively mitigating destructive interference. We further integrate this method with the distributed randomized space-time block coding (STBC) scheme to enhance transmission reliability. Additionally, we propose efficient algorithms for estimating the composite channels that combine both the true propagation channels and the virtual channels. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme significantly outperforms the classical phase dithering scheme across various scenarios.

Title: Event-based Data Format Standard (EVT+)
Authors: Jonah P. Sengupta, Mohammad Imran Vakil, Thanh M. Dang, Ian Pardee, Paul Coen, Olivia Aul
Abstract: Event-based Sensing (EBS) hardware is quickly proliferating while finding foothold in many commercial, industrial, and defense applications. At present, there are a handful of technologically mature systems which produce data streams with diverse output formats. In the near future it is anticipated there will be vendors who offer new sensor hardware which could also yield unique data schema that are not aligned to past efforts. Thus, due to the relative nascent nature of the technology and its potential for widespread use in a variety of applications, it is an opportune time to define a standard for this class of sensors' output data. The intent of this document is to identify and provide a standard for the collected EBS streaming data. The main objective of the standard is to be sensor agnostic, incorporate some of the current sensor configurations and modalities, and account for the developing configurations and modalities. The intent is also to leave enough place holders and space in the standard for future variations that may develop as EBS technology matures.

Title: Fast and Certified Bounding of Security-Constrained DCOPF via Interval Bound Propagation
Authors: Eren Tekeler, Xiangru Zhong, Huan Zhang, Samuel Chevalier
Abstract: Security-Constrained DC Optimal Power Flow (SC DCOPF) is an important tool for transmission system operators, enabling economically efficient and physically secure dispatch decisions. Although CPU-based commercial solvers (e.g., Gurobi) can efficiently solve SC-DCOPF problems with a reasonable number of security constraints, their performance degrades rapidly as both system size and the number of contingencies grow into thousands, leading to a significant computational burden. This introduces a bottleneck for system operators who seek timely decision-making across a wide range of potential threats. In this paper, we design a computational graph representation of the SC-DCOPF-based market-clearing problem, inspired by the third ARPA-E Grid Optimization Competition (GO3). We are able to quickly bound the optimal solution of large-scale SC-DCOPF problems using a GPU-accelerated Neural Network verification tool called Interval Bound Propagation (IBP). Using IBP, we compute certified bounds with a maximum gap of 6.53% for instances up to 617 buses, while demonstrating scalability on challenging systems up to 8,316 buses with a runtime of approximately 0.07 seconds. These results demonstrate that IBP can provide high-quality solution bounds at very fast speeds, and it can help identify infeasibility drivers in challenging SC-DCOPF instances.

Title: Economic Linear Quadratic MPC With Non-Unique Optimal Solutions
Authors: Mario Zanon
Abstract: Asymptotic stability in economic receding horizon control can be obtained under a strict dissipativity assumption, related to positive-definiteness of a so-called rotated cost, and through the use of suitable terminal cost and constraints. In the linear-quadratic case, a common assumption is that the rotated cost is positive definite. The positive semi-definite case has received surprisingly little attention, and the connection to the standard dissipativity assumption has not been investigated. In this paper, we fill this gap by connecting existing results in economic model predictive control with the stability results for the semi-definite case, the properties of the constrained generalized discrete algebraic Riccati equation, and of two optimal control problems. Moreover, we extend recent results relating exponential stability to the choice of terminal cost in the absence of terminal constraints.

Abstract: Data-driven methods for electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation are rapidly progressing. Large datasets have enabled advances in artificial intelligence (AI) based ECG analysis, yet limitations in annotation quality, size, and scope remain major challenges. Here we present CODE-II, a large-scale real-world dataset of 2,735,269 12-lead ECGs from 2,093,807 adult patients collected by the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais (TNMG), Brazil. Each exam was annotated using standardized diagnostic criteria and reviewed by cardiologists. A defining feature of CODE-II is a set of 66 clinically meaningful diagnostic classes, developed with cardiologist input and routinely used in telehealth practice. We additionally provide an open available subset: CODE-II-open, a public subset of 15,000 patients, and the CODE-II-test, a non-overlapping set of 8,475 exams reviewed by multiple cardiologists for blinded evaluation. A neural network pre-trained on CODE-II achieved superior transfer performance on external benchmarks (PTB-XL and CPSC 2018) and outperformed alternatives trained on larger datasets.

Title: Joint Semantic-Channel Coding and Modulation for Token Communications
Authors: Jingkai Ying, Zhijin Qin, Yulong Feng, Liejun Wang, Xiaoming Tao
Abstract: In recent years, the Transformer architecture has achieved outstanding performance across a wide range of tasks and modalities. Token is the unified input and output representation in Transformer-based models, which has become a fundamental information unit. In this work, we consider the problem of token communication, studying how to transmit tokens efficiently and reliably. Point cloud, a prevailing three-dimensional format which exhibits a more complex spatial structure compared to image or video, is chosen to be the information source. We utilize the set abstraction method to obtain point tokens. Subsequently, to get a more informative and transmission-friendly representation based on tokens, we propose a joint semantic-channel and modulation (JSCCM) scheme for the token encoder, mapping point tokens to standard digital constellation points (modulated tokens). Specifically, the JSCCM consists of two parallel Point Transformer-based encoders and a differential modulator which combines the Gumel-softmax and soft quantization methods. Besides, the rate allocator and channel adapter are developed, facilitating adaptive generation of high-quality modulated tokens conditioned on both semantic information and channel conditions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms both joint semantic-channel coding and traditional separate coding, achieving over 1dB gain in reconstruction and more than 6x compression ratio in modulated symbols.

Title: OBHS: An Optimized Block Huffman Scheme for Real-Time Audio Compression
Authors: Muntahi Safwan Mahfi, Md. Manzurul Hasan, Gahangir Hossain
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OBHS (Optimized Block Huffman Scheme), a novel lossless audio compression algorithm tailored for real-time streaming applications. OBHS leverages block-wise Huffman coding with canonical code representation and intelligent fallback mechanisms to achieve high compression ratios while maintaining low computational complexity. Our algorithm partitions audio data into fixed-size blocks, constructs optimal Huffman trees for each block, and employs canonical codes for efficient storage and transmission. Experimental results demonstrate that OBHS attains compression ratios of up to 93.6% for silence-rich audio and maintains competitive performance across various audio types, including pink noise, tones, and real-world recordings. With a linear time complexity of O(n) for n audio samples, OBHS effectively balances compression efficiency and computational demands, making it highly suitable for resource-constrained real-time audio streaming scenarios.

Title: Fine-tuning Pre-trained Audio Models for COVID-19 Detection: A Technical Report
Authors: Daniel Oliveira de Brito, Letícia Gabriella de Souza, Marcelo Matheus Gauy, Marcelo Finger, Arnaldo Candido Junior
Abstract: This technical report investigates the performance of pre-trained audio models on COVID-19 detection tasks using established benchmark datasets. We fine-tuned Audio-MAE and three PANN architectures (CNN6, CNN10, CNN14) on the Coswara and COUGHVID datasets, evaluating both intra-dataset and cross-dataset generalization. We implemented a strict demographic stratification by age and gender to prevent models from exploiting spurious correlations between demographic characteristics and COVID-19 status. Intra-dataset results showed moderate performance, with Audio-MAE achieving the strongest result on Coswara (0.82 AUC, 0.76 F1-score), while all models demonstrated limited performance on Coughvid (AUC 0.58-0.63). Cross-dataset evaluation revealed severe generalization failure across all models (AUC 0.43-0.68), with Audio-MAE showing strong performance degradation (F1-score 0.00-0.08). Our experiments demonstrate that demographic balancing, while reducing apparent model performance, provides more realistic assessment of COVID-19 detection capabilities by eliminating demographic leakage - a confounding factor that inflate performance metrics. Additionally, the limited dataset sizes after balancing (1,219-2,160 samples) proved insufficient for deep learning models that typically require substantially larger training sets. These findings highlight fundamental challenges in developing generalizable audio-based COVID-19 detection systems and underscore the importance of rigorous demographic controls for clinically robust model evaluation.

Title: Reconstruction of three-dimensional shapes of normal and disease-related erythrocytes from partial observations using multi-fidelity neural networks
Authors: Haizhou Wen, He Li, Zhen Li
Abstract: Reconstruction of 3D erythrocyte or red blood cell (RBC) morphology from partial observations, such as microscope images, is essential for understanding the physiology of RBC aging and the pathology of various RBC disorders. In this study, we propose a multi-fidelity neural network (MFNN) approach to fuse high-fidelity cross-sections of an RBC, with a morphologically similar low-fidelity reference 3D RBC shape to recover its full 3D surface. The MFNN predictor combines a convolutional neural network trained on low-fidelity reference RBC data with a feedforward neural network that captures nonlinear morphological correlations, and augments training with surface area and volume constraints for regularization in the low-fidelity branch. This approach is theoretically grounded by a topological homeomorphism between a sphere and 3D RBC surfaces, with training data generated by dissipative particle dynamics simulations of stomatocyte-discocyte-echinocyte transformation. Benchmarking across diverse RBC shapes observed in normal and aged populations, our results show that the MFNN predictor can reconstruct complex RBC morphologies with over 95% coordinate accuracy when provided with at least two orthogonal cross-sections. It is observed that informative oblique cross-sections intersecting spicule tips of echinocytes improve both local and global feature reconstruction, highlighting the value of feature-aware sampling. Our study further evaluates the influence of sampling strategies, shape dissimilarity, and noise, showing enhanced robustness under physically constrained training. Altogether, these results demonstrate the capability of MFNN to reconstruct the 3D shape of normal and aged RBCs from partial cross-sections as observed in conventional microscope images, which could facilitate the quantitative analysis of RBC morphological parameters in normal and disease-related RBC samples.

Title: GeoShield: Byzantine Fault Detection and Recovery for Geo-Distributed Real-Time Cyber-Physical Systems
Authors: Yifan Cai, Linh Thi Xuan Phan
Abstract: Large-scale cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as railway control systems and smart grids, consist of geographically distributed subsystems that are connected via unreliable, asynchronous inter-region networks. Their scale and distribution make them especially vulnerable to faults and attacks. Unfortunately, existing fault-tolerant methods either consume excessive resources or provide only eventual guarantees, making them unsuitable for real-time resource-constrained CPS. We present GeoShield, a resource-efficient solution for defending geo-distributed CPS against Byzantine faults. GeoShield leverages the property that CPS are designed to tolerate brief disruptions and maintain safety, as long as they recover (i.e., resume normal operations or transition to a safe mode) within a bounded amount of time following a fault. Instead of masking faults, it detects them and recovers the system within bounded time, thus guaranteeing safety with much fewer resources. GeoShield introduces protocols for Byzantine fault-resilient network measurement and inter-region omission fault detection that proactively detect malicious message delays, along with recovery mechanisms that guarantee timely recovery while maximizing operational robustness. It is the first bounded-time recovery solution that operates effectively under unreliable networks without relying on trusted hardware. Evaluations using real-world case studies show that it significantly outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and resource efficiency.

Title: Aligning Generative Music AI with Human Preferences: Methods and Challenges
Authors: Dorien Herremans, Abhinaba Roy
Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI for music have achieved remarkable fidelity and stylistic diversity, yet these systems often fail to align with nuanced human preferences due to the specific loss functions they use. This paper advocates for the systematic application of preference alignment techniques to music generation, addressing the fundamental gap between computational optimization and human musical appreciation. Drawing on recent breakthroughs including MusicRL's large-scale preference learning, multi-preference alignment frameworks like diffusion-based preference optimization in DiffRhythm+, and inference-time optimization techniques like Text2midi-InferAlign, we discuss how these techniques can address music's unique challenges: temporal coherence, harmonic consistency, and subjective quality assessment. We identify key research challenges including scalability to long-form compositions, reliability amongst others in preference modelling. Looking forward, we envision preference-aligned music generation enabling transformative applications in interactive composition tools and personalized music services. This work calls for sustained interdisciplinary research combining advances in machine learning, music-theory to create music AI systems that truly serve human creative and experiential needs.

Title: Fourier-KAN-Mamba: A Novel State-Space Equation Approach for Time-Series Anomaly Detection
Authors: Xiancheng Wang, Lin Wang, Rui Wang, Zhibo Zhang, Minghang Zhao
Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection plays a critical role in numerous real-world applications, including industrial monitoring and fault diagnosis. Recently, Mamba-based state-space models have shown remarkable efficiency in long-sequence modeling. However, directly applying Mamba to anomaly detection tasks still faces challenges in capturing complex temporal patterns and nonlinear dynamics. In this paper, we propose Fourier-KAN-Mamba, a novel hybrid architecture that integrates Fourier layer, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), and Mamba selective state-space model. The Fourier layer extracts multi-scale frequency features, KAN enhances nonlinear representation capability, and a temporal gating control mechanism further improves the model's ability to distinguish normal and anomalous patterns. Extensive experiments on MSL, SMAP, and SWaT datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches. Keywords: time-series anomaly detection, state-space model, Mamba, Fourier transform, Kolmogorov-Arnold Network

Title: Data-driven Prediction of Species-Specific Plant Responses to Spectral-Shifting Films from Leaf Phenotypic and Photosynthetic Traits
Authors: Jun Hyeun Kang, Jung Eek Son, Tae In Ahn
Abstract: The application of spectral-shifting films in greenhouses to shift green light to red light has shown variable growth responses across crop species. However, the yield enhancement of crops under altered light quality is related to the collective effects of the specific biophysical characteristics of each species. Considering only one attribute of a crop has limitations in understanding the relationship between sunlight quality adjustments and crop growth performance. Therefore, this study aims to comprehensively link multiple plant phenotypic traits and daily light integral considering the physiological responses of crops to their growth outcomes under SF using artificial intelligence. Between 2021 and 2024, various leafy, fruiting, and root crops were grown in greenhouses covered with either PEF or SF, and leaf reflectance, leaf mass per area, chlorophyll content, daily light integral, and light saturation point were measured from the plants cultivated in each condition. 210 data points were collected, but there was insufficient data to train deep learning models, so a variational autoencoder was used for data augmentation. Most crop yields showed an average increase of 22.5% under SF. These data were used to train several models, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, XGBoost, and feedforward neural network (FFNN), aiming to binary classify whether there was a significant effect on yield with SF application. The FFNN achieved a high classification accuracy of 91.4% on a test dataset that was not used for training. This study provide insight into the complex interactions between leaf phenotypic and photosynthetic traits, environmental conditions, and solar spectral components by improving the ability to predict solar spectral shift effects using SF.

Title: KrawtchoukNet: A Unified GNN Solution for Heterophily and Over-smoothing with Adaptive Bounded Polynomials
Authors: Huseyin Goksu
Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based on polynomial filters, such as ChebyNet, suffer from two critical limitations: 1) performance collapse on "heterophilic" graphs and 2) performance collapse at high polynomial degrees (K), known as over-smoothing. Both issues stem from the static, low-pass nature of standard filters. In this work, we propose `KrawtchoukNet`, a GNN filter based on the discrete Krawtchouk polynomials. We demonstrate that `KrawtchoukNet` provides a unified solution to both problems through two key design choices. First, by fixing the polynomial's domain N to a small constant (e.g., N=20), we create the first GNN filter whose recurrence coefficients are \textit{inherently bounded}, making it exceptionally robust to over-smoothing (achieving SOTA results at K=10). Second, by making the filter's shape parameter p learnable, the filter adapts its spectral response to the graph data. We show this adaptive nature allows `KrawtchoukNet` to achieve SOTA performance on challenging heterophilic benchmarks (Texas, Cornell), decisively outperforming standard GNNs like GAT and APPNP.

Title: LaguerreNet: Advancing a Unified Solution for Heterophily and Over-smoothing with Adaptive Continuous Polynomials
Authors: Huseyin Goksu
Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) suffer from two critical limitations: poor performance on "heterophilic" graphs and performance collapse at high polynomial degrees (K), known as over-smoothing. Both issues stem from the static, low-pass nature of standard filters (e.g., ChebyNet). While adaptive polynomial filters, such as the discrete MeixnerNet, have emerged as a potential unified solution, their extension to the continuous domain and stability with unbounded coefficients remain open questions. In this work, we propose `LaguerreNet`, a novel GNN filter based on continuous Laguerre polynomials. `LaguerreNet` learns the filter's spectral shape by making its core alpha parameter trainable, thereby advancing the adaptive polynomial approach. We solve the severe O(k^2) numerical instability of these unbounded polynomials using a `LayerNorm`-based stabilization technique. We demonstrate experimentally that this approach is highly effective: 1) `LaguerreNet` achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging heterophilic benchmarks. 2) It is exceptionally robust to over-smoothing, with performance peaking at K=10, an order of magnitude beyond where ChebyNet collapses.

Title: NMPC-based Motion Planning with Adaptive Weighting for Dynamic Object Interception
Authors: Chen Cai, Saksham Kohli, Steven Liu
Abstract: Catching fast-moving objects serves as a benchmark for robotic agility, posing significant coordination challenges for cooperative manipulator systems holding a catcher, particularly due to inherent closed-chain constraints. This paper presents a nonlinear model predictive control (MPC)-based motion planner that bridges high-level interception planning with real-time joint space control, enabling dynamic object interception for systems comprising two cooperating arms. We introduce an Adaptive- Terminal (AT) MPC formulation featuring cost shaping, which contrasts with a simpler Primitive-Terminal (PT) approach relying heavily on terminal penalties for rapid convergence. The proposed AT formulation is shown to effectively mitigate issues related to actuator power limit violations frequently encountered with the PT strategy, yielding trajectories and significantly reduced control effort. Experimental results on a robotic platform with two cooperative arms, demonstrating excellent real time performance, with an average planner cycle computation time of approximately 19 ms-less than half the 40 ms system sampling time. These results indicate that the AT formulation achieves significantly improved motion quality and robustness with minimal computational overhead compared to the PT baseline, making it well-suited for dynamic, cooperative interception tasks.

Title: Cartan meets Cramér-Rao
Authors: Sunder Ram Krishnan
Abstract: This paper develops a jet bundle and Cartan geometric foundation for the curvature-aware refinements of the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) introduced in our earlier work. We show that the extrinsic corrections to variance bounds, previously derived from the second fundamental form of the square root embedding $s_\theta=\sqrt{f(\cdot;\theta)}\in L^2(\mu)$ for model density $f(\cdot;\theta)$ with scalar parameter $\theta$, admit an intrinsic formulation within the Cartan prolongation framework. Starting from the canonical contact forms and total derivative on the finite jet bundle $J^m(\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R})$, we construct the Cartan distribution and the associated Ehresmann connection, whose non-integrability and torsion encode the geometric source of curvature corrections in statistical estimation. In the statistical jet bundle $E=\mathbb{R}\times L^2(\mu)$, we point out that the condition for an estimator error to lie in the span of derivatives of $s_\theta$ up to order $m$ is equivalent to the square root map satisfying a linear differential equation of order~$m$. The corresponding submanifold of $J^m(E)$ defined by this equation represents the locus of $m$-th order efficient models, and the prolonged section must form an integral curve of the restricted Cartan vector field. This establishes a one-to-one correspondence between algebraic projection conditions underlying CRB and Bhattacharyya-type bounds and geometric integrability conditions for the statistical section in the jet bundle hierarchy. The resulting framework links variance bounds, curvature, and estimator efficiency through the geometry of Cartan distributions, offering a new differential equation and connection-theoretic interpretation of higher-order information inequalities.

Title: GPU-Accelerated Dynamic Programming for Multistage Stochastic Energy Storage Arbitrage
Authors: Thomas Lee, Andy Sun
Abstract: We develop a GPU-accelerated dynamic programming (DP) method for valuing, operating, and bidding energy storage under multistage stochastic electricity prices. Motivated by computational limitations in existing models, we formulate DP backward induction entirely in tensor-based algebraic operations that map naturally onto massively parallel GPU hardware. Our method accommodates general, potentially non-concave payoff structures, by combining a discretized DP formulation with a convexification procedure that produces market-feasible, monotonic price-quantity bid curves. Numerical experiments using ISO-NE real-time prices demonstrate up to a 100x speedup by the proposed GPU-based DP method relative to CPU computation, and an 8,000x speedup compared to a commercial MILP solver, while retaining sub-0.3% optimality gaps compared to exact benchmarks.

Title: Assessing Power Flow Controllability via Variable Line Reactance
Authors: Eric Haag, Yuhao Chen, Giri Venkataramanan, Manish K. Singh
Abstract: The rapid growth of large data center loads and inverter-based generation is increasing the stress on transmission networks, while expanding grid capacity at the required pace remains challenging. Power flow controllers (PFCs) that adjust effective line reactances to redistribute flows are often viewed as an interim solution to improve transmission network utilization. Traditional flexibility metrics and analysis approaches for PFCs focus on a limited number of operating points and contingencies. Towards gaining system-wide insights, this paper introduces a framework to quantify network flow controllability- the extent to which line flows can be reshaped through reactance adjustments. We derive analytical results demonstrating that installing PFCs on all lines enables complete controllability of feasible flow patterns. Building on these, we conduct empirical studies on the IEEE 39-bus system to examine how controllability varies with the number of PFCs and their reactance adjustment range. These analyses employ a mixed-integer linear program to optimize the siting and sizing of PFCs. Finally, we validate findings under AC power flow physics using an optimization routine that steers flows toward desired setpoints.

Title: DeepContrast: Deep Tissue Contrast Enhancement using Synthetic Data Degradations and OOD Model Predictions
Authors: Nuno Pimpão Martins, Yannis Kalaidzidis, Marino Zerial, Florian Jug
Abstract: Microscopy images are crucial for life science research, allowing detailed inspection and characterization of cellular and tissue-level structures and functions. However, microscopy data are unavoidably affected by image degradations, such as noise, blur, or others. Many such degradations also contribute to a loss of image contrast, which becomes especially pronounced in deeper regions of thick samples. Today, best performing methods to increase the quality of images are based on Deep Learning approaches, which typically require ground truth (GT) data during training. Our inability to counteract blurring and contrast loss when imaging deep into samples prevents the acquisition of such clean GT data. The fact that the forward process of blurring and contrast loss deep into tissue can be modeled, allowed us to propose a new method that can circumvent the problem of unobtainable GT data. To this end, we first synthetically degraded the quality of microscopy images even further by using an approximate forward model for deep tissue image degradations. Then we trained a neural network that learned the inverse of this degradation function from our generated pairs of raw and degraded images. We demonstrated that networks trained in this way can be used out-of-distribution (OOD) to improve the quality of less severely degraded images, e.g. the raw data imaged in a microscope. Since the absolute level of degradation in such microscopy images can be stronger than the additional degradation introduced by our forward model, we also explored the effect of iterative predictions. Here, we observed that in each iteration the measured image contrast kept improving while detailed structures in the images got increasingly removed. Therefore, dependent on the desired downstream analysis, a balance between contrast improvement and retention of image details has to be found.

Title: Exploiting Target Location Distribution in MIMO Radar: PCRB vs. PSBP for Transmit Beampattern Design
Authors: Lingyun Xu, Bowen Wang, Huiyong Li, Ziyang Cheng
Abstract: This paper investigates the issue of how to exploit prior target location distribution for multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radar transmit beampattern design. We consider a MIMO radar aiming to estimate the random angular location parameters of a point target, whose prior distribution information can be exploited by the radar. First, we establish the models of the MIMO radar system and the target location distribution. Based on the considered models, we propose the first category of target location distribution exploitation methods by analyzing the radar direction-of-angle (DoA) estimation performance and deriving a general form of posterior Cramer-Rao bound (PCRB) as the lower bound of the mean square error of DoA estimation. Following this, to investigate the potential of leveraging prior information from two distinct perspectives, thereby providing deeper insights into the estimation process, we proposed the second category of target location distribution exploitation methods by introducing a novel radar metric, probability scaled beampattern (PSBP), from the perspective of radar beampattern. To compare the two methods, we formulate the PCRB and PSBP oriented radar transmit beampattern design problems and propose corresponding low complexity and convergence-guaranteed algorithms to tackle them. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted in different scenarios to provide a comprehensive evaluation and comparison of the radar performance.

Title: RN-SDEs: Limited-Angle CT Reconstruction with Residual Null-Space Diffusion Stochastic Differential Equations
Authors: Jiaqi Guo, Santiago Lopez-Tapia, Wing Shun Li, Yunnan Wu, Marcelo Carignano, Martin Kröger, Vinayak P. Dravid, Igal Szleifer, Vadim Backman, Aggelos K. Katsaggelos
Abstract: Computed tomography is a widely used imaging modality with applications ranging from medical imaging to material analysis. One major challenge arises from the lack of scanning information at certain angles, leading to distorted CT images with artifacts. This results in an ill-posed problem known as the Limited Angle Computed Tomography (LACT) reconstruction problem. To address this problem, we propose Residual Null-Space Diffusion Stochastic Differential Equations (RN-SDEs), which are a variant of diffusion models that characterize the diffusion process with mean-reverting (MR) stochastic differential equations. To demonstrate the generalizability of RN-SDEs, our experiments are conducted on two different LACT datasets, i.e., ChromSTEM and C4KC-KiTS. Through extensive experiments, we show that by leveraging learned Mean-Reverting SDEs as a prior and emphasizing data consistency using Range-Null Space Decomposition (RNSD) based rectification, RN-SDEs can restore high-quality images from severe degradation and achieve state-of-the-art performance in most LACT tasks. Additionally, we present a quantitative comparison of computational complexity and runtime efficiency, highlighting the superior effectiveness of our proposed approach.

Title: Scene-wide Acoustic Parameter Estimation
Authors: Ricardo Falcon-Perez, Ruohan Gao, Gregor Mueckl, Sebastia V. Amengual Gari, Ishwarya Ananthabhotla
Abstract: For augmented (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications, accurate estimates of the acoustic characteristics of a scene are critical for creating a sense of immersion. However, directly estimating Room-impulse Responses (RIRs) from scene geometry is often a challenging, data-expensive task. We propose a method to instead infer spatially-distributed acoustic parameters (such as C50, T60, etc) for an entire scene from lightweight information readily available in an AR/VR context. We consider an image-to-image translation task to transform a 2D floormap, conditioned on a calibration RIR measurement, into 2D heatmaps of acoustic parameters. Moreover, we show that the method also works for directionally-dependent (i.e. beamformed) parameter prediction. We introduce and release a 1000-room, complex-scene dataset to study the task, and demonstrate improvements over strong statistical baselines.

Title: DiffOP: Reinforcement Learning of Optimization-Based Control Policies via Implicit Policy Gradients
Authors: Yuexin Bian, Jie Feng, Yuanyuan Shi
Abstract: Real-world control systems require policies that are not only high-performing but also interpretable and robust. A promising direction toward this goal is model-based control, which learns system dynamics and cost functions from historical data and then uses these models to inform decision-making. Building on this paradigm, we introduce DiffOP, a novel framework for learning optimization-based control policies defined implicitly through optimization control problems. Without relying on value function approximation, DiffOP jointly learns the cost and dynamics models and directly optimizes the actual control costs using policy gradients. To enable this, we derive analytical policy gradients by applying implicit differentiation to the underlying optimization problem and integrating it with the standard policy gradient framework. Under standard regularity conditions, we establish that DiffOP converges to an $\epsilon$-stationary point within $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ iterations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DiffOP through experiments on nonlinear control tasks and power system voltage control with constraints. The code is available at this https URL.

Title: Abnormality Prediction and Forecasting of Laboratory Values from Electrocardiogram Signals Using Multimodal Deep Learning
Authors: Juan Miguel Lopez Alcaraz, Nils Strodthoff
Abstract: This study investigates the feasibility of using electrocardiogram (ECG) data combined with basic patient metadata to estimate and monitor prompt laboratory abnormalities. We use the MIMIC-IV dataset to train multimodal deep learning models on ECG waveforms, demographics, biometrics, and vital signs. Our model is a structured state space classifier with late fusion for metadata. We frame the task as individual binary classifications per abnormality and evaluate performance using AUROC. The models achieve strong performance, with AUROCs above 0.70 for 24 lab values in abnormality prediction and up to 24 in abnormality forecasting, across cardiac, renal, hematological, metabolic, immunological, and coagulation categories. NTproBNP (>353 pg/mL) is best predicted (AUROC > 0.90). Other values with AUROC > 0.85 include Hemoglobin (>17.5 g/dL), Albumin (>5.2 g/dL), and Hematocrit (>51%). Our findings show ECG combined with clinical data enables prompt abnormality prediction and forecasting of lab abnormalities, offering a non-invasive, cost-effective alternative to traditional testing. This can support early intervention and enhanced patient monitoring. ECG and clinical data can help estimate and monitor abnormal lab values, potentially improving care while reducing reliance on invasive and costly procedures.

Title: Minimizing Conservatism in Safety-Critical Control for Input-Delayed Systems via Adaptive Delay Estimation
Authors: Yitaek Kim, Ersin Das, Jeeseop Kim, Aaron D. Ames, Joel W. Burdick, Christoffer Sloth
Abstract: Input delays affect systems such as teleoperation and wirelessly autonomous connected vehicles, and may lead to safety violations. One promising way to ensure safety in the presence of delay is to employ control barrier functions (CBFs), and extensions thereof that account for uncertainty: delay adaptive CBFs (DaCBFs). This paper proposes an online adaptive safety control framework for reducing the conservatism of DaCBFs. The main idea is to reduce the maximum delay estimation error bound so that the state prediction error bound is monotonically non-increasing. To this end, we first leverage the estimation error bound of a disturbance observer to bound the state prediction error. Second, we design two nonlinear programs to update the maximum delay estimation error bound satisfying the prediction error bound, and subsequently update the maximum state prediction error bound used in DaCBFs. The proposed method ensures the maximum state prediction error bound is monotonically non-increasing, yielding less conservatism in DaCBFs. We verify the proposed method in an automated connected truck application, showing that the proposed method reduces the conservatism of DaCBFs.

Title: 6D Rigid Body Localization and Velocity Estimation via Gaussian Belief Propagation
Authors: Niclas Führling, Volodymyr Vizitiv, Kuranage Roche Rayan Ranasinghe, Hyeon Seok Rou, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, David González G., Osvaldo Gonsa
Abstract: We propose a novel message-passing solution to the sixth-dimensional (6D) moving rigid body localization (RBL) problem, in which the three-dimensional (3D) translation vector and rotation angles, as well as their corresponding translational and angular velocities, are all estimated by only utilizing the relative range and Doppler measurements between the "anchor" sensors located at an 3D (rigid body) observer and the "target" sensors of another rigid body. The proposed method is based on a bilinear Gaussian belief propagation (GaBP) framework, employed to estimate the absolute sensor positions and velocities using a range- and Doppler-based received signal model, which is then utilized in the reconstruction of the RBL transformation model, linearized under a small-angle approximation. The method further incorporates a second bivariate GaBP designed to directly estimate the 3D rotation angles and translation vectors, including an interference cancellation (IC) refinement stage to improve the angle estimation performance, followed by the estimation of the angular and the translational velocities. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified via simulations, which confirms its improved performance compared to equivalent state-of-the-art (SotA) techniques.

Title: Explainable and externally validated machine learning for neurocognitive diagnosis via electrocardiograms
Authors: Juan Miguel Lopez Alcaraz, Ebenezer Oloyede, David Taylor, Wilhelm Haverkamp, Nils Strodthoff
Abstract: Background: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis has emerged as a promising tool for detecting physiological changes linked to non-cardiac disorders. Given the close connection between cardiovascular and neurocognitive health, ECG abnormalities may be present in individuals with co-occurring neurocognitive conditions. This highlights the potential of ECG as a biomarker to improve detection, therapy monitoring, and risk stratification in patients with neurocognitive disorders, an area that remains underexplored. Methods: We aim to demonstrate the feasibility to predict neurocognitive disorders from ECG features across diverse patient populations. We utilized ECG features and demographic data to predict neurocognitive disorders defined by ICD-10 codes, focusing on dementia, delirium, and Parkinson's disease. Internal and external validations were performed using the MIMIC-IV and ECG-View datasets. Predictive performance was assessed using AUROC scores, and Shapley values were used to interpret feature contributions. Results: Significant predictive performance was observed for disorders within the neurcognitive disorders. Significantly, the disorders with the highest predictive performance is F03: Dementia, with an internal AUROC of 0.848 (95% CI: 0.848-0.848) and an external AUROC of 0.865 (0.864-0.965), followed by G30: Alzheimer's, with an internal AUROC of 0.809 (95% CI: 0.808-0.810) and an external AUROC of 0.863 (95% CI: 0.863-0.864). Feature importance analysis revealed both known and novel ECG correlates. ECGs hold promise as non-invasive, explainable biomarkers for selected neurocognitive disorders. This study demonstrates robust performance across cohorts and lays the groundwork for future clinical applications, including early detection and personalized monitoring.

Title: Style Content Decomposition-based Data Augmentation for Domain Generalizable Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Zhiqiang Shen, Peng Cao, Jinzhu Yang, Osmar R. Zaiane, Zhaolin Chen
Abstract: Due to domain shifts across diverse medical imaging modalities, learned segmentation models often suffer significant performance degradation during deployment. We posit that these domain shifts can generally be categorized into two main components: 1) "style" shifts, referring to global disparities in image properties such as illumination, contrast, and color; and 2) "content" shifts, which involve local discrepancies in anatomical structures. To address the domain shifts in medical image segmentation, we first factorize an image into style codes and content maps, explicitly modeling the "style" and "content" components. Building on this, we introduce a Style-Content decomposition-based data augmentation algorithm (StyCona), which performs augmentation on both the global style and local content of source-domain images, enabling the training of a well-generalized model for domain generalizable medical image segmentation. StyCona is a simple yet effective plug-and-play module that substantially improves model generalization without requiring additional training parameters or modifications to segmentation model architectures. Experiments on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and fundus photography segmentation tasks, with single and multiple target domains respectively, demonstrate the effectiveness of StyCona and its superiority over state-of-the-art domain generalization methods.

Title: TVC: Tokenized Video Compression with Ultra-Low Bit Rate
Authors: Lebin Zhou, Cihan Ruan, Nam Ling, Zhenghao Chen, Wei Wang, Wei Jiang
Abstract: Tokenized visual representations have shown promise in image compression, yet their extension to video remains underexplored due to the challenges posed by complex temporal dynamics and stringent bit rate constraints. In this paper, we present tokenized video compression (TVC), a token-based dual-stream framework designed to operate effectively at ultra-low bit rates. TVC leverages the Cosmos video tokenizer to extract both discrete and continuous token streams. The discrete tokens are partially masked using a strategic masking scheme and then compressed losslessly with a discrete checkerboard context model to reduce transmission overhead. The masked tokens are reconstructed by a decoder-only Transformer with spatiotemporal token prediction. In parallel, the continuous tokens are quantized and compressed using a continuous checkerboard context model, providing complementary continuous information at ultra-low bit rates. At the decoder side, the two streams are fused with a ControlNet-based multi-scale integration module, ensuring high perceptual quality alongside stable fidelity in reconstruction. Overall, this work illustrates the practicality of tokenized video compression and points to new directions for semantics-aware, token-native approaches.

Title: Operator learning for energy-efficient building ventilation control with computational fluid dynamics simulation of a real-world classroom
Authors: Yuexin Bian, Oliver Schmidt, Yuanyuan Shi
Abstract: Energy-efficient ventilation control plays a vital role in reducing building energy consumption while ensuring occupant health and comfort. While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations provide detailed and physically accurate representation of indoor airflow, their high computational cost limits their use in real-time building control. In this work, we present a neural operator learning framework that combines the physical accuracy of CFD with the computational efficiency of machine learning to enable building ventilation control with the high-fidelity fluid dynamics models. Our method jointly optimizes the airflow supply rates and vent angles to reduce energy use and adhere to air quality constraints. We train an ensemble of neural operator transformer models to learn the mapping from building control actions to airflow fields using high-resolution CFD data. This learned neural operator is then embedded in an optimization-based control framework for building ventilation control. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significant energy savings compared to maximum airflow rate control, rule-based control, as well as data-driven control methods using spatially averaged CO2 prediction and deep learning based reduced order model, while consistently maintaining safe indoor air quality. These results highlight the practicality and scalability of our method in maintaining energy efficiency and indoor air quality in real-world buildings.

Title: The stability of generalized phase retrieval problem over compact groups
Authors: Tal Amir, Tamir Bendory, Nadav Dym, Dan Edidin
Abstract: The generalized phase retrieval problem over compact groups aims to recover a set of matrices -- representing an unknown signal -- from their associated Gram matrices. This framework generalizes the classical phase retrieval problem, which reconstructs a signal from the magnitudes of its Fourier transform, to a richer setting involving non-abelian compact groups. In this broader context, the unknown phases in Fourier space are replaced by unknown orthogonal matrices that arise from the action of a compact group on a finite-dimensional vector space. This problem is primarily motivated by advances in electron microscopy to determining the 3D structure of biological macromolecules from highly noisy observations. To capture realistic assumptions from machine learning and signal processing, we model the signal as belonging to one of several broad structural families: a generic linear subspace, a sparse representation in a generic basis, the output of a generic ReLU neural network, or a generic low-dimensional manifold. Our main result shows that, for a prior of sufficiently low dimension, the generalized phase retrieval problem not only admits a unique solution (up to inherent group symmetries), but also satisfies a bi-Lipschitz property. This implies robustness to both noise and model mismatch -- an essential requirement for practical use, especially when measurements are severely corrupted by noise. These findings provide theoretical support for a wide class of scientific problems under modern structural assumptions, and they offer strong foundations for developing robust algorithms in high-noise regimes.

Title: Bridging the Modality Gap: Softly Discretizing Audio Representation for LLM-based Automatic Speech Recognition
Authors: Mu Yang, Szu-Jui Chen, Jiamin Xie, John Hansen
Abstract: One challenge of integrating speech input with large language models (LLMs) stems from the discrepancy between the continuous nature of audio data and the discrete token-based paradigm of LLMs. To mitigate this gap, we propose a method for integrating vector quantization (VQ) into LLM-based automatic speech recognition (ASR). Using the LLM embedding table as the VQ codebook, the VQ module aligns the continuous representations from the audio encoder with the discrete LLM inputs, enabling the LLM to operate on a discretized audio representation that better reflects the linguistic structure. We further create a soft "discretization" of the audio representation by updating the codebook and performing a weighted sum over the codebook embeddings. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves upon the LLM-based ASR baseline, particularly in out-of-domain conditions. This work highlights the potential of soft discretization as a modality bridge in LLM-based ASR.

Title: Efficient and Generalizable Speaker Diarization via Structured Pruning of Self-Supervised Models
Authors: Jiangyu Han, Petr Pálka, Marc Delcroix, Federico Landini, Johan Rohdin, Jan Cernocký, Lukáš Burget
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) models such as WavLM have substantially advanced speaker diarization by providing rich contextual speech representations. However, the high computational and memory costs of these models hinder deployment in real-time and resource-constrained scenarios. This work presents a systematic study on compressing SSL-based diarization models through structured pruning guided by knowledge distillation. We investigate pruning objectives that target both model parameters and computational complexity, and analyze alternative strategies, showing that a simple overall pruning approach provides the best balance between efficiency and accuracy. Our method achieves up to 80% model size reduction and 4x faster inference without performance degradation. Comprehensive experiments across eight public diarization datasets demonstrate that the pruned models consistently match or surpass the performance of their uncompressed counterparts. Furthermore, we show strong out-of-domain generalization on the CHiME-6 dataset, achieving accuracy comparable to the top systems in the CHiME-7 challenge without any domain adaptation. These results highlight that structured pruning, when guided by distillation, can yield efficient and generalizable diarization systems suitable for real-world applications.

Title: Efficient Discovery of Actual Causality in Stochastic Systems
Authors: Arshia Rafieioskouei, Kenneth Rogale, Borzoo Bonakdarpour
Abstract: Identifying the actual cause of events in engineered systems is a fundamental challenge in system analysis. Finding such causes becomes more challenging in the presence of noise and stochastic behavior in real-world systems. In this paper, we adopt the notion of probabilistic actual causality by Fenton-Glynn, which is a probabilistic extension of Halpern and Pearl's actual causality, and propose a novel method to formally reason about causal effect of events in stochastic systems. We (1) formulate the discovery of probabilistic actual causes in computing systems as an SMT problem, and (2) address the scalability challenges by introducing an abstraction-refinement technique that improves efficiency by up to 95%. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through three case studies, identifying probabilistic actual causes of safety violations in (1) the Mountain Car problem, (2) the Lunar Lander benchmark, and (3) MPC controller for an F-16 autopilot simulator.

Title: Constructed Realities? Technical and Contextual Anomalies in a High-Profile Image
Authors: Matthias Wjst
Abstract: This study offers a forensic assessment of a widely circulated photograph featuring Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, Virginia Giuffre, and Ghislaine Maxwell - an image that has played a pivotal role in public discourse and legal narratives. By comparing multiple published versions, many inconsistencies emerge, including irregularities in lighting, posture, and physical interaction, which are more compatible with digital compositing than with an unaltered snapshot. Because no original print is available and -crucially- because a verifiable audit trail cannot be demanded for a potentially fabricated image, definitive conclusions remain unattainable. Even so, the technical and contextual anomalies indicate that the photograph may have been deliberately constructed. In the absence of further evidence, it remains an unresolved yet symbolically charged artifact within a complex story of abuse, memory, and contested truth.

Title: Density control of multi-agent swarms via bio-inspired leader-follower plasticity
Authors: Gian Carlo Maffettone, Alain Boldini, Mario di Bernardo, Maurizio Porfiri
Abstract: The design of control systems for the spatial self-organization of mobile agents is an open challenge across several engineering domains, including swarm robotics and synthetic biology. Here, we propose a bio-inspired leader-follower solution, which is aware of energy constraints of mobile agents and is apt to deal with large swarms. Akin to many natural systems, control objectives are formulated for the entire collective, and leaders and followers are allowed to plastically switch their role in time. We frame a density control problem, modeling the agents' population via a system of nonlinear partial differential equations. This approach allows for a compact description that inherently avoids the curse of dimensionality and improves analytical tractability. We derive analytical guarantees for the existence of desired steady-state solutions and their local stability for one-dimensional and higher-dimensional problems. We numerically validate our control methodology, offering support to the effectiveness, robustness, and versatility of our proposed bio-inspired control strategy.

Title: On Beamforming for Transmitter Location Privacy in MIMO Systems
Authors: Umair Ali Khan, Lester Ho, Holger Claussen, Mark F. Flanagan, Chinmoy Kundu
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a beamforming framework to ensure transmitter location privacy against sensing-capable MIMO receivers. We propose a novel privacy metric called the direction-of-arrival obfuscation power ratio (DoA-OPR) to design the transmit beamformer. The design approach reshapes the angular power distribution observed at the receiver so that a false direction appears dominant without nulling the line-of-sight (LoS) component. We derive closed-form bounds on the feasible range of DoA-OPR via generalized eigenvalue analysis and formulate an achievable rate-maximization problem under the DoA-OPR constraint. The resulting problem is non-convex but can be efficiently solved using semidefinite relaxation, eigenmode selection, and optimal power allocation. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed DoA-OPR-based beamformer achieves a trade-off between location privacy and communication rate. The proposed design attains higher achievable rates than existing LoS-nulling approaches while maintaining comparable location privacy. A suboptimal design strategy is also proposed with reduced complexity. It achieves a near-optimal communication rate with a reduction of nearly 85%.

Title: The Role of Radiographic Knee Alignment in Total Knee Replacement Outcomes and Opportunities for Artificial Intelligence-Driven Assessment
Authors: Zhisen Hu, Dominic Cullen, David S. Johnson, Aleksei Tiulpin, Timothy F. Cootes, Claudia Lindner
Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most widespread and burdensome health problems [1-4]. Total knee replacement (TKR) may be offered as treatment for end-stage knee OA. Nevertheless, TKR is an invasive procedure involving prosthesis implantation at the knee joint, and around 10% of patients are dissatisfied following TKR [5,6]. Dissatisfaction is often assessed through patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) [7], which are usually completed by patients and assessed by health professionals to evaluate the condition of TKR patients. In clinical practice, predicting poor TKR outcomes in advance could help optimise patient selection and improve management strategies. Radiographic knee alignment is an important biomarker for predicting TKR outcomes and long-term joint health. Abnormalities such as femoral or tibial deformities can directly influence surgical planning, implant selection, and postoperative recovery [8,9]. Traditional alignment measurement is manual, time-consuming, and requires long-leg radiographs, which are not always undertaken in clinical practice. Instead, standard anteroposterior (AP) knee radiographs are often the main imaging modality. Automated methods for alignment assessment in standard knee radiographs are potentially clinically valuable for improving efficiency in the knee OA treatment pathway.

Title: Rotatable Antenna Aided Mixed Near-Field and Far-Field Communications in the Upper Mid-Band: Interference Analysis and Joint Optimization
Authors: Yunpu Zhang, Changsheng You, Hing Cheung So, Dusit Niyato, Yonina C. Eldar
Abstract: In this paper, we propose to leverage rotatable antennas (RAs) for improving the communication performance in mixed near-field and far-field communication systems by exploiting a new spatial degree-of-freedom (DoF) offered by antenna rotation to mitigate complex near-field interference and mixed-field interference. Specifically, we investigate a modular RA-enabled mixed-field downlink communication system, where a base station (BS) consisting of multiple RA subarrays communicates with multiple near-field users in the presence of several legacy far-field users. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum-rate of the near-field users by jointly optimizing the power allocation and rotation angles of all subarrays at the BS. To gain useful insights into the effect of RAs on mixed-field communications, we first analyze a special case where all subarrays share the same rotation angle and obtain closed-form expressions for the rotation-aware normalized near-field interference and the rotation-aware normalized mixed-field interference using the Fresnel integrals. We then analytically reveal that array rotation effectively suppresses both interference types, thereby significantly enhancing mixed-field communication performance. For the general case involving subarray-wise rotation, we propose an efficient double-layer algorithm to obtain a high-quality solution, where the inner layer optimizes power allocation using the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique, while the outer layer determines the rotation angles of all subarrays via particle swarm optimization (PSO). Finally, numerical results highlight the significant performance gains achieved by RAs over conventional fixed-antenna systems and demonstrate the effectiveness of our developed joint design compared to benchmark schemes.

Title: Electromagnetic Quantitative Inversion for Translationally Moving Targets via Phase Correlation Registration of Back-Projection Images
Authors: Yitao Lin, Dahai Dai, Shilong Sun, Yuchen Wu, Bo Pang
Abstract: A novel electromagnetic quantitative inversion scheme for translationally moving targets via phase correlation registration of back-projection (BP) images is proposed. Based on a time division multiplexing multiple-input multiple-output (TDM-MIMO) radar architecture, the scheme first achieves high-precision relative positioning of the target, then applies relative motion compensation to perform iterative inversion on multi-cycle MIMO measurement data, thereby reconstructing the target's electromagnetic parameters. As a general framework compatible with other mainstream inversion algorithms, we exemplify our approach by incorporating the classical cross-correlated contrast source inversion (CC-CSI) into iterative optimization step of the scheme, resulting in a new algorithm termed RMC-CC-CSI. Numerical and experimental results demonstrate that RMC-CC-CSI offers accelerated convergence, enhanced reconstruction fidelity, and improved noise immunity over conventional CC-CSI for stationary targets despite increased computational cost.

Title: Artifacts Are Not Noise: Embodied Resonance and the 70% Signal Loss in Conventional EEG
Authors: Ahmed Gamal Eldin
Abstract: Current AI systems excel at pattern recognition but fail at causal reasoning. We argue this is not an engineering limitation but reveals something fundamental about the nature of understanding itself. We propose that causal cognition requires a specific physical architecture: stochastic, coupled oscillators with whole-system coordination. To test this, we analyzed high-density EEG (64 channels, 10 subjects, 500 plus trials) from a P300 target recognition task. We computed the Kuramoto Order Parameter (R) to measure global phase synchronization and compared it to standard voltage (ERP) and coherence (ITC) metrics. Four findings establish the framework. Phase and voltage are globally independent (r of 0.048) yet strongly trial-coupled (r of 0.590), proving R captures hidden cognitive structure. Voltage precedes phase by 293 ms, revealing sequential computation. Frequency decomposition shows Theta (169 ms), Alpha (286 ms), and Beta (777 ms) cascade. Our metric is distinct from standard ITC (r of 0.155). Then we tested the standard assumption. Conventional artifact rejection removes eye movements, muscle activity, and autonomic signals before analysis. The standard model assumes cognition is neural activity plus noise. We ran the identical analysis with and without rejection. Removing artifacts reduced the trial-level correlation threefold (from 0.590 to 0.195). Target discrimination reversed sign (from positive 0.6 percent to negative 0.4 percent). What we discard as noise is 70 percent of the signal. This falsifies the standard model. Cognition is not isolated neural computation. It is whole-body phase synchronization spanning neural, muscular, and autonomic systems. For AI, the implications are direct: embodied sensorimotor integration is not optional. It is the substrate that makes understanding possible.

Title: A Geometry Map-Based Site-Specific Propagation Channel Model for Urban Scenarios
Authors: Junzhe Song, Ruisi He, Mi Yang, Zhengyu Zhang, Shuaiqi Gao, Xiaoying Zhang, Bo Ai
Abstract: With the rapid deployments of 5G and 6G networks, accurate modeling of urban radio propagation has become critical for system design and network planning. However, conventional statistical or empirical models fail to fully capture the influence of detailed geometric features on site-specific channel variances in dense urban environments. In this paper, we propose a geometry map-based propagation channel model that directly extracts key parameters from a 3D geometry map and incorporates the Uniform Theory of Diffraction (UTD) to recursively compute multiple diffraction fields, thereby enabling accurate prediction of site-specific large-scale path loss and time-varying Doppler characteristics in urban scenarios. A well-designed identification algorithm is developed to efficiently detect buildings that significantly affect signal propagation. The proposed model is validated using urban measurement data, showing excellent agreement of path loss in both line-of-sight (LOS) and nonline-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. In particular, for NLOS scenarios with complex diffractions, it outperforms the 3GPP and simplified models, reducing the RMSE by 7.1 dB and 3.18 dB, respectively. Doppler analysis further demonstrates its accuracy in capturing time-varying propagation characteristics, confirming the scalability and generalization of the model in urban environments.

Title: Agentic AI Systems in Electrical Power Systems Engineering: Current State-of-the-Art and Challenges
Authors: Soham Ghosh, Gaurav Mittal
Abstract: Agentic AI systems have recently emerged as a critical and transformative approach in artificial intelligence, offering capabilities that extend far beyond traditional AI agents and contemporary generative AI models. This rapid evolution necessitates a clear conceptual and taxonomical understanding to differentiate this new paradigm. Our paper addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review that establishes a precise definition and taxonomy for "agentic AI," with the aim of distinguishing it from previous AI paradigms. The concepts are gradually introduced, starting with a highlight of its diverse applications across the broader field of engineering. The paper then presents four detailed, state-of-the-art use case applications specifically within electrical engineering. These case studies demonstrate practical impact, ranging from an advanced agentic framework for streamlining complex power system studies and benchmarking to a novel system developed for survival analysis of dynamic pricing strategies in battery swapping stations. Finally, to ensure robust deployment, the paper provides detailed failure mode investigations. From these findings, we derive actionable recommendations for the design and implementation of safe, reliable, and accountable agentic AI systems, offering a critical resource for researchers and practitioners.

Title: Optimal Control of Nonlinear Systems with Unknown Dynamics
Authors: Wenjian Hao, Paulo C. Heredia, Shaoshuai Mou
Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven method to find a closed-loop optimal controller, which minimizes a specified infinite-horizon cost function for systems with unknown dynamics. Suppose the closed-loop optimal controller can be parameterized by a given class of functions, hereafter referred to as the policy. The proposed method introduces a novel gradient estimation framework, which approximates the gradient of the cost function with respect to the policy parameters via integrating the Koopman operator with the classical concept of actor-critic. This enables the policy parameters to be tuned iteratively using gradient descent to achieve an optimal controller, leveraging the linearity of the Koopman operator. The convergence analysis of the proposed framework is provided. The control performance of the proposed method is evaluated through simulations compared with classical optimal control methods that usually assume the dynamics are known.

Title: UniAV: Unified Audio-Visual Perception for Multi-Task Video Event Localization
Authors: Tiantian Geng, Teng Wang, Jinming Duan, Yanfu Zhang, Weili Guan, Feng Zheng, Ling shao
Abstract: Video event localization tasks include temporal action localization (TAL), sound event detection (SED) and audio-visual event localization (AVEL). Existing methods tend to over-specialize on individual tasks, neglecting the equal importance of these different events for a complete understanding of video content. In this work, we aim to develop a unified framework to solve TAL, SED and AVEL tasks together to facilitate holistic video understanding. However, it is challenging since different tasks emphasize distinct event characteristics and there are substantial disparities in existing task-specific datasets (size/domain/duration). It leads to unsatisfactory results when applying a naive multi-task strategy. To tackle the problem, we introduce UniAV, a Unified Audio-Visual perception network to effectively learn and share mutually beneficial knowledge across tasks and modalities. Concretely, we propose a unified audio-visual encoder to derive generic representations from multiple temporal scales for videos from all tasks. Meanwhile, task-specific experts are designed to capture the unique knowledge specific to each task. Besides, instead of using separate prediction heads, we develop a novel unified language-aware classifier by utilizing semantic-aligned task prompts, enabling our model to flexibly localize various instances across tasks with an impressive open-set ability to localize novel categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniAV, with its unified architecture, significantly outperforms both single-task models and the naive multi-task baseline across all three tasks. It achieves superior or on-par performances compared to the state-of-the-art task-specific methods on ActivityNet 1.3, DESED and UnAV-100 benchmarks.

Title: Robust Adaptive Safe Robotic Grasping with Tactile Sensing
Authors: Yitaek Kim, Jeeseop Kim, Albert H. Li, Aaron D. Ames, Christoffer Sloth
Abstract: Robotic grasping requires safe force interaction to prevent a grasped object from being damaged or slipping out of the hand. In this vein, this paper proposes an integrated framework for grasping with formal safety guarantees based on Control Barrier Functions. We first design contact force and force closure constraints, which are enforced by a safety filter to accomplish safe grasping with finger force control. For sensory feedback, we develop a technique to estimate contact point, force, and torque from tactile sensors at each finger. We verify the framework with various safety filters in a numerical simulation under a two-finger grasping scenario. We then experimentally validate the framework by grasping multiple objects, including fragile lab glassware, in a real robotic setup, showing that safe grasping can be successfully achieved in the real world. We evaluate the performance of each safety filter in the context of safety violation and conservatism, and find that disturbance observer-based control barrier functions provide superior performance for safety guarantees with minimum conservatism.

Title: OODTE: A Differential Testing Engine for the ONNX Optimizer
Authors: Nikolaos Louloudakis, Ajitha Rajan
Abstract: With over 760 stars on GitHub and being part of the official ONNX repository, the ONNX Optimizer is the default tool for applying graph-based optimizations to ONNX models. Despite its widespread use, its ability to maintain model accuracy during optimization has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we present OODTE, a utility designed to automatically and comprehensively evaluate the correctness of the ONNX Optimizer. OODTE adopts a straightforward yet powerful differential testing and evaluation methodology, which can be readily adapted for use with other compiler optimizers. Specifically, OODTE takes a collection of ONNX models, applies optimizations, and executes both the original and optimized versions across a user-defined input set, automatically capturing any issues encountered during optimization. When discrepancies in accuracy arise, OODTE iteratively isolates the responsible optimization pass by repeating the process at a finer granularity. We applied OODTE to 130 well-known models from the official ONNX Model Hub, spanning diverse tasks including classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, text summarization, question answering, and sentiment analysis. Our evaluation revealed that 9.2% of the model instances either caused the optimizer to crash or led to the generation of invalid models using default optimization strategies. Additionally, 30% of classification models and 16.6% of object detection and segmentation models exhibited differing outputs across original and optimized versions, whereas models focused on text-related tasks were generally robust to optimization. OODTE uncovered 15 issues-14 previously unknown-affecting 9 of 47 optimization passes and the optimizer overall. All issues were reported to the ONNX Optimizer team. OODTE offers a simple but effective framework for validating AI model optimizers, applicable beyond the ONNX ecosystem.

Title: MelodySim: Measuring Melody-aware Music Similarity for Plagiarism Detection
Authors: Tongyu Lu, Charlotta-Marlena Geist, Jan Melechovsky, Abhinaba Roy, Dorien Herremans
Abstract: We propose MelodySim, a melody-aware music similarity model and dataset for plagiarism detection. First, we introduce a novel method to construct a dataset focused on melodic similarity. By augmenting Slakh2100, an existing MIDI dataset, we generate variations of each piece while preserving the melody through modifications such as note splitting, arpeggiation, minor track dropout, and re-instrumentation. A user study confirms that positive pairs indeed contain similar melodies, while other musical tracks are significantly changed. Second, we develop a segment-wise melodic-similarity detection model that uses a MERT encoder and applies a triplet neural network to capture melodic similarity. The resulting decision matrix highlights where plagiarism might occur. The experiments show that our model is able to outperform baseline models in detecting similar melodic fragments on the MelodySim test set.

Title: Stochastically Structured Reservoir Computers for Financial and Economic System Identification
Authors: Lendy Banegas, Fredy Vides
Abstract: This paper introduces a methodology for identifying and simulating financial and economic systems using stochastically structured reservoir computers (SSRCs). The framework combines structure-preserving embeddings with graph-informed coupling matrices to model inter-agent dynamics while enhancing interpretability. A constrained optimization scheme guarantees compliance with both stochastic and structural constraints. Two empirical case studies, a nonlinear stochastic dynamic model and regional inflation network dynamics, demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in capturing complex nonlinear patterns and enabling interpretable predictive analysis under uncertainty.

Title: Threshold dynamics in time-delay systems: polynomial $β$-control in a pressing process and connections to blow-up
Authors: Masato Kimura, Hirotaka Kuma, Yikan Liu, Kazunori Matsui, Masahiro Yamamoto, Zhenxing Yang
Abstract: This paper addresses a press control problem in straightening machines with small time delays due to system communication. To handle this, we propose a generalized $\beta$-control method, which replaces conventional linear velocity control with a polynomial of degree $\beta \ge 1$. The resulting model is a delay differential equation (DDE), for which we derive basic properties through nondimensionalization and analysis. Numerical experiments suggest the existence of a threshold initial velocity separating overshoot and non-overshoot dynamics, which we formulate as a conjecture. Based on this, we design a control algorithm under velocity constraints and confirm its effectiveness. We also highlight a connection between threshold behavior and finite-time blow-up in DDEs. This study provides a practical control strategy and contributes new insights into threshold dynamics and blow-up phenomena in delay systems.

Title: Self-Supervised Temporal Super-Resolution of Energy Data using Generative Adversarial Transformer
Authors: Xuanhao Mu, Gökhan Demirel, Yuzhe Zhang, Jianlei Liu, Thorsten Schlachter, Veit Hagenmeyer
Abstract: To bridge the temporal granularity gap in energy network design and operation based on Energy System Models, resampling of time series is required. While conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue, this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling tasks by 10%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application scenario is improved by 13%.

Title: Solving Imaging Inverse Problems Using Plug-and-Play Denoisers: Regularization and Optimization Perspectives
Authors: Hong Ye Tan, Subhadip Mukherjee, Junqi Tang
Abstract: Inverse problems lie at the heart of modern imaging science, with broad applications in areas such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and microscopy. Recent years have witnessed a paradigm shift in solving imaging inverse problems, where data-driven regularizers are used increasingly, leading to remarkably high-fidelity reconstruction. A particularly notable approach for data-driven regularization is to use learned image denoisers as implicit priors in iterative image reconstruction algorithms. This chapter presents a comprehensive overview of this powerful and emerging class of algorithms, commonly referred to as plug-and-play (PnP) methods. We begin by providing a brief background on image denoising and inverse problems, followed by a short review of traditional regularization strategies. We then explore how proximal splitting algorithms, such as the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and proximal gradient descent (PGD), can naturally accommodate learned denoisers in place of proximal operators, and under what conditions such replacements preserve convergence. The role of Tweedie's formula in connecting optimal Gaussian denoisers and score estimation is discussed, which lays the foundation for regularization-by-denoising (RED) and more recent diffusion-based posterior sampling methods. We discuss theoretical advances regarding the convergence of PnP algorithms, both within the RED and proximal settings, emphasizing the structural assumptions that the denoiser must satisfy for convergence, such as non-expansiveness, Lipschitz continuity, and local homogeneity. We also address practical considerations in algorithm design, including choices of denoiser architecture and acceleration strategies.

Title: Uniform Sampling from the Reachable Set Using Optimal Transport
Authors: Karthik Elamvazhuthi, Sachin Shivakumar
Abstract: Estimating the reachable set of a dynamical system is a fundamental problem in control theory, particularly when control inputs are bounded. Direct simulation using randomly sampled admissible controls often leads to trajectories that cluster near attractors, resulting in poor coverage of the reachable set. To achieve a more uniform distribution of terminal states, we formulate the problem within an Optimal Transport (OT) framework. In this setting, the goal is to steer the system so that the final state distribution, determined by the chosen controls and initial conditions, matches a desired target distribution. Enforcing this condition exactly is not possible since the reachable set is not known. So we introduce an $L_2$-norm based regularization of the terminal distribution that relaxes the constraint while promoting uniform coverage. The resulting formulation can be approximated by a finite-dimensional, particle-based optimal control problem with kernel-coupled terminal cost. We show that this approach converges to the original formulation and demonstrate through numerical examples that it provides significantly more uniform reachable-set sampling than random control strategies.

Title: Retrieval Augmented Generation based context discovery for ASR
Authors: Dimitrios Siskos, Stavros Papadopoulos, Pablo Peso Parada, Jisi Zhang, Karthikeyan Saravanan, Anastasios Drosou
Abstract: This work investigates retrieval augmented generation as an efficient strategy for automatic context discovery in context-aware Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system, in order to improve transcription accuracy in the presence of rare or out-of-vocabulary terms. However, identifying the right context automatically remains an open challenge. This work proposes an efficient embedding-based retrieval approach for automatic context discovery in ASR. To contextualize its effectiveness, two alternatives based on large language models (LLMs) are also evaluated: (1) large language model (LLM)-based context generation via prompting, and (2) post-recognition transcript correction using LLMs. Experiments on the TED-LIUMv3, Earnings21 and SPGISpeech demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces WER by up to 17% (percentage difference) relative to using no-context, while the oracle context results in a reduction of up to 24.1%.

Title: Flexibility aggregation via set projection for distribution grids with multiple interconnections
Authors: Maísa Beraldo Bandeira, Alexander Engelmann, Timm Faulwasser
Abstract: With the increasing number of flexible energy devices in distribution grids, coordination between Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and Distribution System Operators (DSOs) becomes critical for optimal system operation. One form of coordination is to solve the overall system operation problem in a hierarchical way, computing Feasible Operational Regions (FORs) for the interconnection between TSO/DSO. Most methods for computing FORs rely on the assumption of only one interconnection point between TSO and DSOs, which is often violated in practice. In this work, we propose a method for computing FORs in distribution grids with multiple interconnection points to the transmission grid. We test our method in a grid with two interconnecting points and analyze the properties of the resulting high-dimensional FOR from a power systems perspective.

Authors: Chao Yan, Boyong Wu, Peng Yang, Pengfei Tan, Guoqiang Hu, Li Xie, Yuxin Zhang, Xiangyu (Tony)Zhang, Fei Tian, Xuerui Yang, Xiangyu Zhang, Daxin Jiang, Shuchang Zhou, Gang Yu
Abstract: We present Step-Audio-EditX, the first open-source LLM-based audio model excelling at expressive and iterative audio editing encompassing emotion, speaking style, and paralinguistics alongside robust zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities. Our core innovation lies in leveraging only large-margin synthetic data, which circumvents the need for embedding-based priors or auxiliary modules. This large-margin learning approach enables both iterative control and high expressivity across voices, and represents a fundamental pivot from the conventional focus on representation-level disentanglement. Evaluation results demonstrate that Step-Audio-EditX surpasses both MiniMax-2.6-hd and Doubao-Seed-TTS-2.0 in emotion editing and other fine-grained control tasks.

Title: Optimizing the flight path for a scouting Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle
Authors: Raghav Adhikari, Sachet Khatiwada, Suman Poudel
Abstract: Post-disaster situations pose unique navigation challenges. One of those challenges is the unstructured nature of the environment, which makes it hard to layout paths for rescue vehicles. We propose the use of Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in such scenario to perform reconnaissance across the environment. To accomplish this, we propose an optimization-based approach to plan a path for the UAV at optimal height where the sensors of the UAV can cover the most area and collect data with minimum uncertainty.
