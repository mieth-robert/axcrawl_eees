Title: JaneEye: A 12-nm 2K-FPS 18.9-$μ$J/Frame Event-based Eye Tracking Accelerator
Authors: Tao Han, Ang Li, Qinyu Chen, Chang Gao
Abstract: Eye tracking has become a key technology for gaze-based interactions in Extended Reality (XR). However, conventional frame-based eye-tracking systems often fall short of XR's stringent requirements for high accuracy, low latency, and energy efficiency. Event cameras present a compelling alternative, offering ultra-high temporal resolution and low power consumption. In this paper, we present JaneEye, an energy-efficient event-based eye-tracking hardware accelerator designed specifically for wearable devices, leveraging sparse, high-temporal-resolution event data. We introduce an ultra-lightweight neural network architecture featuring a novel ConvJANET layer, which simplifies the traditional ConvLSTM by retaining only the forget gate, thereby halving computational complexity without sacrificing temporal modeling capability. Our proposed model achieves high accuracy with a pixel error of 2.45 on the 3ET+ dataset, using only 17.6K parameters, with up to 1250 Hz event frame rate. To further enhance hardware efficiency, we employ custom linear approximations of activation functions (hardsigmoid and hardtanh) and fixed-point quantization. Through software-hardware co-design, our 12-nm ASIC implementation operates at 400 MHz, delivering an end-to-end latency of 0.5 ms (equivalent to 2000 Frames Per Second (FPS)) at an energy efficiency of 18.9 $\mu$J/frame. JaneEye sets a new benchmark in low-power, high-performance eye-tracking solutions suitable for integration into next-generation XR wearables.

Title: An Efficient Quality Metric for Video Frame Interpolation Based on Motion-Field Divergence
Authors: Conall Daly, Darren Ramsook, Anil Kokaram
Abstract: Video frame interpolation is a fundamental tool for temporal video enhancement, but existing quality metrics struggle to evaluate the perceptual impact of interpolation artefacts effectively. Metrics like PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS ignore temporal coherence. State-of-the-art quality metrics tailored towards video frame interpolation, like FloLPIPS, have been developed but suffer from computational inefficiency that limits their practical application. We present $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$, a novel full-reference quality metric that enhances PSNR through motion divergence weighting, a technique adapted from archival film restoration where it was developed to detect temporal inconsistencies. Our approach highlights singularities in motion fields which is then used to weight image errors. Evaluation on the BVI-VFI dataset (180 sequences across multiple frame rates, resolutions and interpolation methods) shows $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$ achieves statistically significant improvements: +0.09 Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient over FloLPIPS, while being 2.5$\times$ faster and using 4$\times$ less memory. Performance remains consistent across all content categories and are robust to the motion estimator used. The efficiency and accuracy of $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$ enables fast quality evaluation and practical use as a loss function for training neural networks for video frame interpolation tasks. An implementation of our metric is available at this http URL.

Title: A Control Theory inspired Exploration Method for a Linear Bandit driven by a Linear Gaussian Dynamical System
Authors: Jonathan Gornet, Yilin Mo, Bruno Sinopoli
Abstract: The paper introduces a linear bandit environment where the reward is the output of a known Linear Gaussian Dynamical System (LGDS). In this environment, we address the fundamental challenge of balancing exploration -- gathering information about the environment -- and exploitation -- selecting to the action with the highest predicted reward. We propose two algorithms, Kalman filter Upper Confidence Bound (Kalman-UCB) and Information filter Directed Exploration Action-selection (IDEA). Kalman-UCB uses the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty. IDEA selects actions that maximize the combination of the predicted reward and a term that quantifies how much an action minimizes the error of the Kalman filter state prediction, which depends on the LGDS property called observability. IDEA is motivated by applications such as hyperparameter optimization in machine learning. A major problem encountered in hyperparameter optimization is the large action spaces, which hinder the performance of methods inspired by principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty as they need to explore each action to lower reward prediction uncertainty. To predict if either Kalman-UCB or IDEA will perform better, a metric based on the LGDS properties is provided. This metric is validated with numerical results across a variety of randomly generated environments.

Title: Robust Data-Driven Control for Nonlinear Systems Using their Digital Twins and Quadratic Funnels
Authors: Shiva Shakeri, Mehran Mesbahi
Abstract: This paper examines a robust data-driven approach for the safe deployment of systems with nonlinear dynamics using their imperfect digital twins. Our contribution involves proposing a method that fuses the digital twin's nominal trajectory with online, data-driven uncertainty quantification to synthesize robust tracking controllers. Specifically, we derive data-driven bounds to capture the deviations of the actual system from its prescribed nominal trajectory informed via its digital twin. Subsequently, the dataset is used in the synthesis of quadratic funnels -- robust positive invariant tubes around the nominal trajectory -- via linear matrix inequalities built on the time-series data. The resulting controller guarantees constraint satisfaction while adapting to the true system behavior through a segmented learning strategy, where each segment's controller is synthesized using uncertainty information from the previous segment. This work establishes a systematic framework for obtaining safety certificates in learning-based control of nonlinear systems with imperfect models.

Title: Satellite Assignment Policy Learning for Coexistence in LEO Networks
Authors: Jeong Min Kong, Ian P. Roberts
Abstract: Unlike in terrestrial cellular networks, certain frequency bands for low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems have thus far been allocated on a non-exclusive basis. In this context, systems that launch their satellites earlier (referred to as primary systems) are given spectrum access priority over those that launch later, known as secondary systems. For a secondary system to function, it is expected to either coordinate with primary systems or ensure that it does not cause excessive interference to primary ground users. Reliably meeting this interference constraint requires real-time knowledge of the receive beams of primary users, which in turn depends on the primary satellite-to-primary user associations. However, in practice, primary systems have thus far not publicly disclosed their satellite assignment policies; therefore, it becomes essential for secondary systems to develop methods to infer such policies. Assuming there is limited historical data indicating which primary satellites have served which primary users, we propose an end-to-end graph structure learning-based algorithm for learning highest elevation primary satellite assignment policies, that, upon deployment, can directly map the primary satellite coordinates into assignment decisions for the primary users. Simulation results show that our method can outperform the best baseline, achieving approximately a 15% improvement in prediction accuracy.

Title: Delay-Augmented Stacked Intelligent Surfaces: Potential, Challenges, and Opportunities
Authors: Hibatallah Alwazani, Omran Abbas, Loic Markley, Anas Chaaban
Abstract: Stacked intelligent surfaces (SIS)s have been proposed recently as an enabling technology for Holographic Multiple Input Multiple Output (HMIMO) and Ultra-massive MIMO (umMIMO) technologies. Their utility can extend beyond spatial wave-domain processing of signals if they are enhanced with strategically-tuned symbol-duration level delays to enable temporal processing as well. In this work, we introduce the idea of a delay-augmented SIS (DA-SIS). We shed light on the feasibility of realizing delay units in an SIS. Then, we discuss the relevance of the proposed DA-SIS and present a use case that illustrates its potential, wherein the DA-SIS serves as an analog equalizer that aids in eliminating multi-path-induced inter-symbol-interference (ISI). We show how the number of elements affect the equalization process using the bit error rate (BER) as a metric, and demonstrate the potential of the DA-SIS in equalization via comparing with digital equalizers as a benchmark. Finally, we present opportunities and future research directions that can be undertaken to bring this idea to fruition.

Title: A Drone-mounted Magnetometer System for Automatic Interference Removal and Landmine Detection
Authors: Alex Paul Hoffmann, Matthew G. Finley, Eftyhia Zesta, Mark B. Moldwin, Lauro V. Ojeda
Abstract: Landmines have been extensively used in conflict zones as an indiscriminate weapon to control military movements, often remaining active long after hostilities have ended. Their presence poses a persistent danger to civilians, hindering post-war recovery efforts, causing injuries or death, and restricting access to essential land for agriculture and infrastructure. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) equipped with magnetometers are commonly used to detect remnant hidden landmines but come with significant technical challenges due to magnetic field interference from UAV electronics such as motors. We propose the use of a frame-mounted UAV-borne two-magnetometer payload to perform a two-step automated interference removal and landmine detection analysis. The first step removes interference via the Wavelet-Adaptive Interference Cancellation for Underdetermined Platform (WAIC-UP) method designed for spaceflight magnetometers. The second method uses the Rapid Unsupervised Detection of Events (RUDE) algorithm to detect landmine signatures. This two-step WAIC-UP/RUDE approach with multiple magnetometers achieves high-fidelity ordinance detection at a low computational cost and simplifies the design of magnetic survey payloads. We validate the method through a Monte Carlo simulation of randomized landmine placements in a 10 x 10 m square grid and drone motor interference. Additionally, we assess the efficacy of the algorithm by varying the drone's altitude, examining its performance at different heights above the ground.

Title: A New Partial State-Feedback IDA-PBC for Two-Dimensional Nonlinear Systems: Application to Power Converters with Experimental Results
Authors: Rafael Cisneros, Leyan Fang, Wei He, Romeo Ortega
Abstract: In this paper we propose a variation of the widely popular Interconnection-and-Damping-Assigment Passivity-Based Control (IDA-PBC) based on Poincare's Lemma to design output feedback globally stabilizing controllers for two dimensional systems. The procedure is constructive and, in comparison with the classical IDA-PBC, whose application is often stymied by the need to solve the (infamous) matching partial differential equation (PDE), in this new method the PDE is replaced by an ordinary differential equation, whose solution is far simpler. The procedure is then applied for the design of voltage-feedback controllers for the three most typical DC-to-DC power converter topologies: the Buck, Boost and Buck-Boost. It is assumed that these converters feed an uncertain load, which is characterized by a static relation between its voltage and current. In the case when the load consists of the parallel connection of a resistive term and a constant power load we propose an adaptive version of the design, adding an identification scheme for the load parameters. This allows the controller to regulate the converter output when the load varies-that is a typical scenario in these applications. Extensive numerical simulations and experimental results validate the approach.

Title: Meta-Learning-Driven Resource Optimization in Full-Duplex ISAC with Movable Antennas
Authors: Ali Amhaz, Shreya Khisa, Mohamed Elhattab, Chadi Assi, Sanaa Sharafeddine
Abstract: This paper investigates a full-duplex (FD) scenario where a base station (BS) equipped with movable antennas (MAs) simultaneously provides communication services to a set of downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) users while also enabling sensing functionalities for target detection, thereby supporting integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology. Additionally, a receiving BS, also equipped with MAs (denoted as BS R), is responsible for capturing the reflected echo. To optimize this setup, we formulate an optimization problem aimed at maximizing the signal-to-noise and interference ratio (SINR) of the captured echo. This is achieved by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming vectors at the FD BS, the receiving beamforming vectors at both the FD BS and BS R, the UL users' transmit power, and the MAs' positions at both BSs, all while satisfying the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for both sensing and communication. Given the non-convex nature of the problem and the high coupling between the variables, we employ a gradient-based meta-learning (GML) approach tailored for large-scale optimization. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed meta-learning approach, achieving results within 99% of the optimal solution. Furthermore, the MA-based scheme outperforms several benchmark approaches, highlighting its advantages in practical ISAC applications.

Title: Comparative Field Deployment of Reinforcement Learning and Model Predictive Control for Residential HVAC
Authors: Ozan Baris Mulayim, Elias N. Pergantis, Levi D. Reyes Premer, Bingqing Chen, Guannan Qu, Kevin J. Kircher, Mario Bergés
Abstract: Advanced control strategies like Model Predictive Control (MPC) offer significant energy savings for HVAC systems but often require substantial engineering effort, limiting scalability. Reinforcement Learning (RL) promises greater automation and adaptability, yet its practical application in real-world residential settings remains largely undemonstrated, facing challenges related to safety, interpretability, and sample efficiency. To investigate these practical issues, we performed a direct comparison of an MPC and a model-based RL controller, with each controller deployed for a one-month period in an occupied house with a heat pump system in West Lafayette, Indiana. This investigation aimed to explore scalability of the chosen RL and MPC implementations while ensuring safety and comparability. The advanced controllers were evaluated against each other and against the existing controller. RL achieved substantial energy savings (22\% relative to the existing controller), slightly exceeding MPC's savings (20\%), albeit with modestly higher occupant discomfort. However, when energy savings were normalized for the level of comfort provided, MPC demonstrated superior performance. This study's empirical results show that while RL reduces engineering overhead, it introduces practical trade-offs in model accuracy and operational robustness. The key lessons learned concern the difficulties of safe controller initialization, navigating the mismatch between control actions and their practical implementation, and maintaining the integrity of online learning in a live environment. These insights pinpoint the essential research directions needed to advance RL from a promising concept to a truly scalable HVAC control solution.

Title: A Robust Neural Control Design for Multi-drone Slung Payload Manipulation with Control Contraction Metrics
Authors: Xinyuan Liang, Longhao Qian, Yi Lok Lo, Hugh H.T. Liu
Abstract: This paper presents a robust neural control design for a three-drone slung payload transportation system to track a reference path under external disturbances. The control contraction metric (CCM) is used to generate a neural exponentially converging baseline controller while complying with control input saturation constraints. We also incorporate the uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE) technique to dynamically compensate for persistent disturbances. The proposed framework yields a modularized design, allowing the controller and estimator to perform their individual tasks and achieve a zero trajectory tracking error if the disturbances meet certain assumptions. The stability and robustness of the complete system, incorporating both the CCM controller and the UDE compensator, are presented. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the capability of the proposed control design to follow complicated trajectories under external disturbances.

Title: Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning with Anytime Safety Guarantees via Robust Safe Gradient Flow
Authors: Pol Mestres, Arnau Marzabal, Jorge Cortés
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of solving constrained reinforcement learning (RL) problems with anytime guarantees, meaning that the algorithmic solution must yield a constraint-satisfying policy at every iteration of its evolution. Our design is based on a discretization of the Robust Safe Gradient Flow (RSGF), a continuous-time dynamics for anytime constrained optimization whose forward invariance and stability properties we formally characterize. The proposed strategy, termed RSGF-RL, is an off-policy algorithm which uses episodic data to estimate the value functions and their gradients and updates the policy parameters by solving a convex quadratically constrained quadratic program. Our technical analysis combines statistical analysis, the theory of stochastic approximation, and convex analysis to determine the number of episodes sufficient to ensure that safe policies are updated to safe policies and to recover from an unsafe policy, both with an arbitrary user-specified probability, and to establish the asymptotic convergence to the set of KKT points of the RL problem almost surely. Simulations on a navigation example and the cart-pole system illustrate the superior performance of RSGF-RL with respect to the state of the art.

Title: Probabilistic Control Barrier Functions: Safety in Probability for Discrete-Time Stochastic Systems
Authors: Pol Mestres, Blake Werner, Ryan K. Cosner, Aaron D. Ames
Abstract: Control systems operating in the real world face countless sources of unpredictable uncertainties. These random disturbances can render deterministic guarantees inapplicable and cause catastrophic safety failures. To overcome this, this paper proposes a method for designing safe controllers for discrete-time stochastic systems that retain probabilistic guarantees of safety. To do this we modify the traditional notion of a control barrier function (CBF) to explicitly account for these stochastic uncertainties and call these new modified functions probabilistic CBFs. We show that probabilistic CBFs can be used to design controllers that guarantee safety over a finite number of time steps with a prescribed probability. Next, by leveraging various uncertainty quantification methods, such as concentration inequalities, the scenario approach, and conformal prediction, we provide a variety of sufficient conditions that result in computationally tractable controllers with tunable probabilistic guarantees across a plethora of practical scenarios. Finally, we showcase the applicability of our results in simulation and hardware for the control of a quadruped robot.

Title: A Scalable Design Approach to Resilient Architectures for Interconnected Cyber-Physical Systems: Safety Guarantees under Multiple Attacks
Authors: Eman Badr, Abdullah Al Maruf
Abstract: Complex, interconnected cyber-physical systems (CPS) are increasingly prevalent in domains such as power systems. Cyber-resilient architectures have been proposed to recover compromised cyber components of CPS. Recent works have studied tuning the recovery times of such architectures to guarantee safety in single-system settings. Extending these designs to interconnected CPS is more challenging, since solutions must account for attacks on multiple subsystems that can occur in any order and potentially infinite possible temporal overlap. This paper aims to address the aforementioned challenge by developing a scalable framework to assign resilient architectures and to inform the tuning of their recovery times. Our approach introduces a scalar index that quantifies the impact of each subsystem on safety under compromised input. These indices aggregate linearly across subsystems, enabling scalable analysis under arbitrary attack orderings and temporal overlaps. We establish a linear inequality relating each subsystem's index and recovery time that guarantees safety and guides resilient architecture assignment. We also propose a segmentation-based approach to strengthen the previously derived conditions. We then present algorithms to compute the proposed indices and to find a cost-optimal architecture assignment with a safety guarantee. We validate the framework through a case study on temperature regulation in interconnected rooms under different attack scenarios.

Title: Stability and Robustness of Time-Varying Opinion Dynamics: A Graph-Theoretic Approach
Authors: M. Hossein Abedinzadeh, Emrah Akyol
Abstract: We study the stability of opinion dynamics in the time-varying Friedkin-Johnsen (TVFJ) model, which captures both persistent individual biases and adaptive social influence. We introduce two temporal structures, defected temporal graphs (DTGs) and weakly defected temporal graphs (WDTGs), that serve as graph-theoretic certificates linking stubborn influence and temporal connectivity to contraction of the state-transition matrix. Using these tools, we prove asymptotic stability of TVFJ dynamics under infinitely recurring DTGs, exponential stability in semi-periodic defected networks, and asymptotic stability of a trust-based extension under the weaker condition of recurring WDTGs. We also establish boundedness of the omega-limit set, showing that long-run opinions remain within the convex hull of innate beliefs, and characterize the limit set for periodically switching systems via a p-LTI decomposition with the tight bound that the size of the omega-limit set is at most p. Finally, we show that exponential stability persists under bounded perturbations, ensuring robustness in noisy or imperfect networks. These results unify algebraic contraction tests with interpretable graph-based reasoning, providing scalable and resilient tools for analyzing opinion formation in evolving social and human-AI networks.

Title: The Analysis and Performance of LODC-OFDM Signal in Nonlinear Rydberg Atomic Sensor
Authors: Hao Wu, Xinyuan Yao, Rui Ni, Chen Gong
Abstract: Rydberg atomic sensors have been seen as novel radio frequency (RF) measurements and the high sensitivity to a large range of frequencies makes it attractive for communications reception. However, the signal sensing process in Rydberg system involves sequential transduction from electromagnetic waves to optical signals and finally to electrical signals. The unipolar characteristic of the optical interface inherently restricts conventional OFDM reception. Therefore, adopting unipolar OFDM schemes, inspired by optical communication systems, becomes essential for compatible signal transmission. In this work, we investigate the amplitude modulation-to-amplitude modulation (AM-AM) characteristics of Rydberg atomic sensors, establishing an empirical approximation function. Building on the direct current-biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) framework, we propose a novel local oscillator direct current-biased OFDM (LODC-OFDM) scheme specifically optimized for Rydberg-based sensing, effectively addressing the broadband OFDM reception challenge. Then, we adopt Bussgang theorem to analyze the nonlinear distortion of LODC-OFDM signals and the results in closed-form solutions are derived for AM/AM curves approximated by Taylor series expansion and for the ideal pre-distortion case. In real experiments, the experimental and theoretical results fit well.

Title: Median2Median: Zero-shot Suppression of Structured Noise in Images
Authors: Jianxu Wang, Ge Wang
Abstract: Image denoising is a fundamental problem in computer vision and medical imaging. However, real-world images are often degraded by structured noise with strong anisotropic correlations that existing methods struggle to remove. Most data-driven approaches rely on large datasets with high-quality labels and still suffer from limited generalizability, whereas existing zero-shot methods avoid this limitation but remain effective only for independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise. To address this gap, we propose Median2Median (M2M), a zero-shot denoising framework designed for structured noise. M2M introduces a novel sampling strategy that generates pseudo-independent sub-image pairs from a single noisy input. This strategy leverages directional interpolation and generalized median filtering to adaptively exclude values distorted by structured artifacts. To further enlarge the effective sampling space and eliminate systematic bias, a randomized assignment strategy is employed, ensuring that the sampled sub-image pairs are suitable for Noise2Noise training. In our realistic simulation studies, M2M performs on par with state-of-the-art zero-shot methods under i.i.d. noise, while consistently outperforming them under correlated noise. These findings establish M2M as an efficient, data-free solution for structured noise suppression and mark the first step toward effective zero-shot denoising beyond the strict i.i.d. assumption.

Title: SEP Analysis of 1-Bit Quantized SIMO Systems with QPSK over Fading Channels
Authors: Amila Ravinath, Minhua Ding, Bikshapathi Gouda, Italo Atzeni, Antti Tölli
Abstract: The average symbol error probability (SEP) of a 1-bit quantized single-input multiple-output (SIMO) system is analyzed under Rayleigh fading channels and quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulation. Previous studies have partially characterized the diversity gain for selection combining (SC). In this paper, leveraging a novel analytical method, an exact analytical SEP expression is derived for a 1-bit quantized SIMO system employing QPSK modulation at the transmitter and maximum ratio combining (MRC) at the receiver. The corresponding diversity and coding gains of a SIMO-MRC system are also determined. Furthermore, the diversity and coding gains of a 1-bit quantized SIMO-SC system are quantified for an arbitrary number of receive antennas, thereby extending and complementing prior results.

Title: 3D 8-Ary Noise Modulation Using Bayesian- and Kurtosis-based Detectors
Authors: Hadi Zayyani, Felipe A. P. de Figueiredo, Mohammad Salman, Rausley A. A. de Souza
Abstract: This paper presents a novel three-dimensional (3D) 8-ary noise modulation scheme that introduces a new dimension: the mixture probability of a Mixture of Gaussian (MoG) distribution. This proposed approach utilizes the dimensions of mean and variance, in addition to the new probability dimension. Within this framework, each transmitted symbol carries three bits, each corresponding to a distinct sub-channel. For detection, a combination of specialized detectors is employed: a simple threshold based detector for the first sub-channel bit (modulated by the mean), a Maximum-Likelihood (ML) detector for the second sub-channel bit (modulated by the variance), a Kurtosis-based, Jarque-Bera (JB) test, and Bayesian Hypothesis (BHT)-based detectors for the third bit (modulated by the MoG probability). The Kurtosis- and JB-based detectors specifically distinguish between Gaussian (or near-Gaussian) and non-Gaussian MoG distributions by leveraging higher-order statistical measures. The Bit Error Probabilities (BEPs) are derived for the threshold-, Kurtosis-, and BHT-based detectors. The optimum threshold for the Kurtosis-based detector is also derived in a tractable manner. Simulation results demonstrate that a comparably low BEP is achieved for the third sub-channel bit relative to existing two-dimensional (2D) schemes. Simultaneously, the proposed scheme increases the data rate by a factor of 1.5 and 3 compared to the Generalized Quadratic noise modulator and the classical binary KLJN noise modulator, respectively. Furthermore, the Kurtosis-based detector offers a low-complexity solution, achieving an acceptable BEP of approximately 0.06.

Title: Exactly or Approximately Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Estimation According to Wasserstein Radii Being Small or Large
Authors: Xiao Ding, Enbin Song, Dunbiao Niu, Zhujun Cao, Qingjiang Shi
Abstract: This paper primarily considers the robust estimation problem under Wasserstein distance constraints on the parameter and noise distributions in the linear measurement model with additive noise, which can be formulated as an infinite-dimensional nonconvex minimax problem. We prove that the existence of a saddle point for this problem is equivalent to that for a finite-dimensional minimax problem, and give a counterexample demonstrating that the saddle point may not exist. Motivated by this observation, we present a verifiable necessary and sufficient condition whose parameters can be derived from a convex problem and its dual. Additionally, we also introduce a simplified sufficient condition, which intuitively indicates that when the Wasserstein radii are small enough, the saddle point always exists. In the absence of the saddle point, we solve an finite-dimensional nonconvex minimax problem, obtained by restricting the estimator to be linear. Its optimal value establishes an upper bound on the robust estimation problem, while its optimal solution yields a robust linear estimator. Numerical experiments are also provided to validate our theoretical results.

Title: Composite Generalized Quadratic Noise Modulation via Signal Addition: Towards Higher Dimensional Noise Modulations
Authors: Hadi Zayyani, Mohammad Salman, Felipe A. P. de Figueiredo, Rausley A. A. de Souza
Abstract: This letter proposes superposing two Generalized Quadratic Noise Modulators (GQNM) by simply adding their outputs. It creates a 16-ary noise modulator that resembles QAM modulators in classical communication. It modulates the information bits on four different means and four different variances. It could also be applied to reach higher-order modulations than 16-ary schemes by adding the outputs of more than two modulators, which is not discussed in detail in this letter and left for future work. By selecting the parameters necessary for satisfying the theoretical distinguishability conditions provided in the paper, we can reach better performances in comparison to the Kirchhoff-Law Johnson Noise (KLJN) modulator and the GQNM modulator, which is verified by the simulations. The better result in terms of smaller Bit Error Probability (BEP) is achieved by increasing the complexity in the modulator, the transmitter, and the detectors in the receiver.

Title: Closed-form Single UAV-aided Emitter Localization and Trajectory Design Using Doppler and TOA Measurements
Authors: Samaneh Motie, Hadi Zayyani, Mohammad Salman, Hasan Abu Hilal
Abstract: In this paper, a single Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicle (UAV)-aided localization algorithm which uses both Doppler and Time of Arrival (ToA) measurements is presented. In contrast to Doppler-based localization algorithms which are based on non-convex functions, exploiting ToA measurements in a Least-Square (LS) Doppler-based cost function, leads to a quadratic convex function whose minimizer lies on a line. Utilizing the ToA measurements in addition to the linear equation of minimizer, a closed form solution is obtained for the emitter location using a constrained LS optimization. In addition, a trajectory design of the UAV is provided which has also closed-form solution. Simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in comparison to some others in the literature.

Title: Performance Optimization for Movable Antenna Enhanced MISO-OFDM Systems
Authors: Ruixi Feng, Weidong Mei, Lele Lu, Xin Wei, Zhi Chen, Zhen Gao, Boyu Ning
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) technology offers a flexible approach to enhancing wireless channel conditions by adjusting antenna positions within a designated region. While most existing works focus on narrowband MA systems, this paper investigates MA position optimization for an MA-enhanced multiple-input single-output (MISO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system. This problem appears to be particularly challenging due to the frequency-flat nature of MA positioning, which should accommodate the channel conditions across different subcarriers. To overcome this challenge, we discretize the movement region into a multitude of sampling points, thereby converting the continuous position optimization problem into a discrete point selection problem. Although this problem is combinatorial, we develop an efficient partial enumeration algorithm to find the optimal solution using a branch-and-bound framework, where a graph-theoretic method is incorporated to effectively prune suboptimal solutions. In the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, a simplified graph-based algorithm is also proposed to obtain the optimal MA positions without the need for enumeration. Simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs), while narrowband-based antenna position optimization can achieve near-optimal performance.

Title: Joint Optimization of Speaker and Spoof Detectors for Spoofing-Robust Automatic Speaker Verification
Authors: Oğuzhan Kurnaz, Jagabandhu Mishra, Tomi H. Kinnunen, Cemal Hanilçi
Abstract: Spoofing-robust speaker verification (SASV) combines the tasks of speaker and spoof detection to authenticate speakers under adversarial settings. Many SASV systems rely on fusion of speaker and spoof cues at embedding, score or decision levels, based on independently trained subsystems. In this study, we respect similar modularity of the two subsystems, by integrating their outputs using trainable back-end classifiers. In particular, we explore various approaches for directly optimizing the back-end for the recently-proposed SASV performance metric (a-DCF) as a training objective. Our experiments on the ASVspoof 5 dataset demonstrate two important findings: (i) nonlinear score fusion consistently improves a-DCF over linear fusion, and (ii) the combination of weighted cosine scoring for speaker detection with SSL-AASIST for spoof detection achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing min a-DCF to 0.196 and SPF-EER to 7.6%. These contributions highlight the importance of modular design, calibrated integration, and task-aligned optimization for advancing robust and interpretable SASV systems.

Title: NGGAN: Noise Generation GAN Based on the Practical Measurement Dataset for Narrowband Powerline Communications
Authors: Ying-Ren Chien, Po-Heng Chou, You-Jie Peng, Chun-Yuan Huang, Hen-Wai Tsao, Yu Tsao
Abstract: Capturing comprehensive statistics of nonperiodic asynchronous impulsive noise is a critical issue in enhancing impulse noise processing for narrowband powerline communication (NB-PLC) transceivers. However, existing mathematical noise generative models capture only some of the characteristics of additive noise. Therefore, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN), called the noise-generation GAN (NGGAN), that learns the complicated characteristics of practically measured noise samples for data augmentation. To closely match the statistics of complicated noise in NB-PLC systems, we measured the NB-PLC noise via the analog coupling and bandpass filtering circuits of a commercial NB-PLC modem to build a realistic dataset. Specifically, the NGGAN design approaches based on the practically measured dataset are as follows: (i) we design the length of input signals that the NGGAN model can fit to facilitate cyclo-stationary noise generation. (ii) Wasserstein distance is used as a loss function to enhance the similarity between the generated noise and the training dataset and ensure that the sample diversity is sufficient for various applications. (iii) To measure the similarity performance of the GAN-based models based on mathematical and practically measured datasets, we perform quantitative and qualitative analyses. The training datasets include (1) a piecewise spectral cyclo-stationary Gaussian model (PSCGM), (2) a frequency-shift (FRESH) filter, and (3) practical measurements from NB-PLC systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed NGGAN trained using waveform characteristics is closer to the practically measured dataset in terms of the quality of the generated noise.

Title: A TSO-DSO Coordination Framework via Analytical Representation and Monetization of PQV-Based Distribution System Flexibility
Authors: Burak Dindar, Can Berk Saner, Hüseyin Kemal Çakmak, Veit Hagenmeyer
Abstract: As the role of distribution system (DS) flexibility in transmission system operator (TSO) network management becomes increasingly vital, data privacy concerns hinder seamless interoperability. The notion of the feasible operating region (FOR), defined in the PQ domain, has emerged as a promising privacy-preserving approach. However, effectively leveraging FOR in TSO operations remains challenging due to three key factors: its accurate determination in large-scale, meshed DS networks; its tractable analytical representation; and its economic valuation. In the present paper, we propose a novel AC optimal power flow (OPF)-based method to construct a three-dimensional PQV-FOR, explicitly accounting for voltage variability and diverse flexibility-providing unit (FPU) characteristics. The construction process employs a two-stage sampling strategy that combines bounding box projection and Fibonacci direction techniques to efficiently capture the FOR. We then introduce an implicit polynomial fitting approach to analytically represent the FOR. Furthermore, we derive a quadratic cost function over the PQV domain to monetize the FOR. Thus, the proposed framework enables single-round TSO-DSO coordination: the DSO provides an analytical FOR and cost model; the TSO determines operating point at the point of common coupling (PCC) within the FOR-based AC-OPF; and the DSO computes FPU dispatch by solving its local OPF, without computationally intensive disaggregation or iterative coordination. Case studies on meshed DS with up to 533 buses, integrated into TS, demonstrates the method's efficiency compared to standard AC-OPF. On average, the proposed approach yields negligible cost deviations of at most 0.058% across test cases, while reducing computation times by up to 58.11%.

Title: SLAP: Learning Speaker and Health-Related Representations from Natural Language Supervision
Authors: Angelika Ando, Auguste Crabeil, Adrien Lesage, Rachid Riad
Abstract: Speech encodes paralinguistic information such as demographics, voice quality, and health. Yet no audio foundation model supports zero-shot or out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to these tasks. We introduce SLAP (Speaker contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining), the first model aligning speech with natural language descriptions of speaker and health metadata through contrastive learning. SLAP combines a Vision Transformer audio encoder with text encoders, trained on more than 3400 hours across 9 datasets with diverse speaker annotations. We evaluated on 38 binary classification tasks spanning demographics, voice characteristics, and clinical assessments across 14 datasets in 7 languages. SLAP achieves 62.9% average F1 in zero-shot evaluation, a 48% relative improvement over CLAP (42.4%), while demonstrating strong OOD generalization to unseen languages and clinical populations. When fine-tuned with linear probing, SLAP reaches 69.3% F1 overall and achieves best-in-class performance on health tasks (57.9% F1), surpassing larger foundation models.

Title: GFSR-Net: Guided Focus via Segment-Wise Relevance Network for Interpretable Deep Learning in Medical Imaging
Authors: Jhonatan Contreras, Thomas Bocklitz
Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in medical image analysis, however its adoption in clinical practice is limited by a lack of interpretability. These models often make correct predictions without explaining their reasoning. They may also rely on image regions unrelated to the disease or visual cues, such as annotations, that are not present in real-world conditions. This can reduce trust and increase the risk of misleading diagnoses. We introduce the Guided Focus via Segment-Wise Relevance Network (GFSR-Net), an approach designed to improve interpretability and reliability in medical imaging. GFSR-Net uses a small number of human annotations to approximate where a person would focus within an image intuitively, without requiring precise boundaries or exhaustive markings, making the process fast and practical. During training, the model learns to align its focus with these areas, progressively emphasizing features that carry diagnostic meaning. This guidance works across different types of natural and medical images, including chest X-rays, retinal scans, and dermatological images. Our experiments demonstrate that GFSR achieves comparable or superior accuracy while producing saliency maps that better reflect human expectations. This reduces the reliance on irrelevant patterns and increases confidence in automated diagnostic tools.

Title: Clustering of Acoustic Environments with Variational Autoencoders for Hearing Devices
Authors: Luan Vinícius Fiorio, Ivana Nikoloska, Wim van Houtum, Ronald M. Aarts
Abstract: Particularly in hearing devices, the environmental context is taken into account for audio processing, often through classification. Traditional acoustic environment classification relies on classical algorithms, which are unable to extract meaningful representations of high-dimensionality data, or on supervised learning, being limited by the availability of labels. Knowing that human-imposed labels do not always reflect the true structure of acoustic scenes, we explore the (unsupervised) clustering of acoustic environments using variational autoencoders (VAEs), presenting a structured latent space suitable for the task. We propose a VAE model for categorical latent clustering employing a Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization with a time-context windowing scheme, tailored for real-world hearing device scenarios. Additionally, general adaptations on VAE architectures for audio clustering are also proposed. The approaches are validated through the clustering of spoken digits, a simpler task where labels are meaningful, and urban soundscapes, which recordings present strong overlap in time and frequency. While all variational methods succeeded when clustering spoken digits, only the proposed model achieved effective clustering performance on urban acoustic scenes, given its categorical nature.

Title: Wearable and Ultra-Low-Power Fusion of EMG and A-Mode US for Hand-Wrist Kinematic Tracking
Authors: Giusy Spacone, Sebastian Frey, Mattia Orlandi, Pierangelo Maria Rapa, Victor Kartsch, Simone Benatti, Luca Benini, Andrea Cossettini
Abstract: Hand gesture recognition based on biosignals has shown strong potential for developing intuitive human-machine interaction strategies that closely mimic natural human behavior. In particular, sensor fusion approaches have gained attention for combining complementary information and overcoming the limitations of individual sensing modalities, thereby enabling more robust and reliable systems. Among them, the fusion of surface electromyography (EMG) and A-mode ultrasound (US) is very promising. However, prior solutions rely on power-hungry platforms unsuitable for multi-day use and are limited to discrete gesture classification. In this work, we present an ultra-low-power (sub-50 mW) system for concurrent acquisition of 8-channel EMG and 4-channel A-mode US signals, integrating two state-of-the-art platforms into fully wearable, dry-contact armbands. We propose a framework for continuous tracking of 23 degrees of freedom (DoFs), 20 for the hand and 3 for the wrist, using a kinematic glove for ground-truth labeling. Our method employs lightweight encoder-decoder architectures with multi-task learning to simultaneously estimate hand and wrist joint angles. Experimental results under realistic sensor repositioning conditions demonstrate that EMG-US fusion achieves a root mean squared error of $10.6^\circ\pm2.0^\circ$, compared to $12.0^\circ\pm1^\circ$ for EMG and $13.1^\circ\pm2.6^\circ$ for US, and a R$^2$ score of $0.61\pm0.1$, with $0.54\pm0.03$ for EMG and $0.38\pm0.20$ for US.

Title: Coordinated Car-following Using Distributed MPC
Authors: Di Shen, Qi Dai, Suzhou Huang
Abstract: Within the modeling framework of Markov games, we propose a series of algorithms for coordinated car-following using distributed model predictive control (DMPC). Instead of tracking prescribed feasible trajectories, driving policies are solved directly as outcomes of the DMPC optimization given the driver's perceivable states. The coordinated solutions are derived using the best response dynamics via iterated self-play, and are facilitated by direct negotiation using inter-agent or agent-infrastructure communication. These solutions closely approximate either Nash equilibrium or centralized optimization. By re-parameterizing the action sequence in DMPC as a curve along the planning horizon, we are able to systematically reduce the original DMPC to very efficient grid searches such that the optimal solution to the original DMPC can be well executed in real-time. Within our modeling framework, it is natural to cast traffic control problems as mechanism design problems, in which all agents are endogenized on an equal footing with full incentive compatibility. We show how traffic efficiency can be dramatically improved while keeping stop-and-go phantom waves tamed at high vehicle densities. Our approach can be viewed as an alternative way to formulate coordinated adaptive cruise control (CACC) without an explicit platooning (or with all vehicles in the traffic system treated as a single extended platoon). We also address the issue of linear stability of the associated discrete-time traffic dynamics and demonstrate why it does not always tell the full story about the traffic stability.

Title: Computing on Dirty Paper: Interference-Free Integrated Communication and Computing
Authors: Kuranage Roche Rayan Ranasinghe, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, David González G., Carlo Fischione
Abstract: Inspired by Costa's pioneering work on dirty paper coding (DPC), this paper proposes a novel scheme for integrated communication and computing (ICC), named Computing on Dirty Paper, whereby the transmission of discrete data symbols for communication, and over-the-air computation (AirComp) of nomographic functions can be achieved simultaneously over common multiple-access channels. In particular, the proposed scheme allows for the integration of communication and computation in a manner that is asymptotically interference-free, by precanceling the computing symbols at the transmitters (TXs) using DPC principles. A simulation-based assessment of the proposed ICC scheme under a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) setup is also offered, including the evaluation of performance for data detection, and of mean-squared-error (MSE) performance for function computation, over a block of symbols. The results validate the proposed method and demonstrate its ability to significantly outperform state-of-the-art (SotA) ICC schemes in terms of both bit error rate (BER) and MSE.

Title: Joint Jammer Mitigation and Data Detection
Authors: Gian Marti, Christoph Studer
Abstract: Multi-antenna (or MIMO) processing is a promising solution to the problem of jammer mitigation. Existing methods mitigate the jammer based on an estimate of its spatial signature that is acquired through a dedicated training phase. This strategy has two main drawbacks: (i) it reduces the communication rate since no data can be transmitted during the training phase and (ii) it can be evaded by smart or multi-antenna jammers that do not transmit during the training phase or that dynamically change their subspace through time-varying beamforming. To address these drawbacks, we propose Joint jammer Mitigation and data Detection (JMD), a novel paradigm for MIMO jammer mitigation. The core idea of JMD is to estimate and remove the jammer interference subspace jointly with detecting the legitimate transmit data over multiple time slots. Doing so removes the need for a dedicated and rate-reducing training period while being able to mitigate smart and dynamic multi-antenna jammers. We provide two JMD-type algorithms, SANDMAN and MAED, that differ in the way they estimate the channels of the legitimate transmitters and achieve different complexity-performance tradeoffs. Extensive simulations demonstrate the efficacy of JMD for jammer mitigation.

Title: A Secure Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing for Wireless Communication Systems
Authors: Ping Wang, Zulin Wang, Yuanhan Ni, Qu Luo, Yuanfang Ma, Xiaosi Tian, Pei Xiao
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) has garnered significant attention due to its superior performance in high-mobility scenarios, coupled with multiple waveform parameters that provide greater degrees of freedom for system design. This paper introduces a novel secure affine frequency division multiplexing (SE-AFDM) system, which advances prior designs by dynamically varying an AFDM pre-chirp parameter to enhance physical-layer security. In the SE-AFDM system, the pre-chirp parameter is dynamically generated from a codebook controlled by a long-period pseudo-noise (LPPN) sequence. Instead of applying spreading in the data domain, our parameter-domain spreading approach provides additional security while maintaining reliability and high spectrum efficiency. We also propose a synchronization framework to solve the problem of reliably and rapidly synchronizing the time-varying parameter in fast time-varying channels. The theoretical derivations prove that unsynchronized eavesdroppers cannot eliminate the nonlinear impact of the time-varying parameter and further provide useful guidance for codebook design. Simulation results demonstrate the security advantages of the proposed SE-AFDM system in high-mobility scenarios, while our hardware prototype validates the effectiveness of the proposed synchronization framework.

Title: Joint DOA and Attitude Sensing Based on Tri-Polarized Continuous Aperture Array
Authors: Haonan Si, Zhaolin Wang, Xiansheng Guo, Jin Zhang, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: This paper investigates joint direction-of-arrival (DOA) and attitude sensing using tri-polarized continuous aperture arrays (CAPAs). By employing electromagnetic (EM) information theory, the spatially continuous received signals in tri-polarized CAPA are modeled, thereby enabling accurate DOA and attitude estimation. To facilitate subspace decomposition for continuous operators, an equivalent continuous-discrete transformation technique is developed. Moreover, both self- and cross-covariances of tri-polarized signals are exploited to construct a tri-polarized spectrum, significantly enhancing DOA estimation performance. Theoretical analyses reveal that the identifiability of attitude information fundamentally depends on the availability of prior target snapshots. Accordingly, two attitude estimation algorithms are proposed: one capable of estimating partial attitude information without prior knowledge, and the other achieving full attitude estimation when such knowledge is available. Numerical results demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed framework.

Title: MSRepaint: Multiple Sclerosis Repaint with Conditional Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model for Bidirectional Lesion Filling and Synthesis
Authors: Jinwei Zhang, Lianrui Zuo, Yihao Liu, Hang Zhang, Samuel W. Remedios, Bennett A. Landman, Peter A. Calabresi, Shiv Saidha, Scott D. Newsome, Dzung L. Pham, Jerry L. Prince, Ellen M. Mowry, Aaron Carass
Abstract: In multiple sclerosis, lesions interfere with automated magnetic resonance imaging analyses such as brain parcellation and deformable registration, while lesion segmentation models are hindered by the limited availability of annotated training data. To address both issues, we propose MSRepaint, a unified diffusion-based generative model for bidirectional lesion filling and synthesis that restores anatomical continuity for downstream analyses and augments segmentation through realistic data generation. MSRepaint conditions on spatial lesion masks for voxel-level control, incorporates contrast dropout to handle missing inputs, integrates a repainting mechanism to preserve surrounding anatomy during lesion filling and synthesis, and employs a multi-view DDIM inversion and fusion pipeline for 3D consistency with fast inference. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of MSRepaint across multiple tasks. For lesion filling, we evaluate both the accuracy within the filled regions and the impact on downstream tasks including brain parcellation and deformable registration. MSRepaint outperforms the traditional lesion filling methods FSL and NiftySeg, and achieves accuracy on par with FastSurfer-LIT, a recent diffusion model-based inpainting method, while offering over 20 times faster inference. For lesion synthesis, state-of-the-art MS lesion segmentation models trained on MSRepaint-synthesized data outperform those trained on CarveMix-synthesized data or real ISBI challenge training data across multiple benchmarks, including the MICCAI 2016 and UMCL datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate that MSRepaint's unified bidirectional filling and synthesis capability, with full spatial control over lesion appearance, enables high-fidelity simulation of lesion evolution in longitudinal MS progression.

Title: Event-triggered control and communication for single-master multi-slave teleoperation systems with Try-Once-Discard protocol
Authors: Yuling Li, Chenxi Li, Kun Liu, Jie Dong, Rolf Johansson
Abstract: Single-master multi-slave (SMMS) teleoperation systems can perform multiple tasks remotely in a shorter time, cover large-scale areas, and adapt more easily to single-point failures, thereby effectively encompassing a broader range of applications. As the number of slave manipulators sharing a communication network increases, the limitation of communication bandwidth becomes critical. To alleviate bandwidth usage, the Try-Once-Discard (TOD) scheduling protocol and event-triggered mechanisms are often employed separately. In this paper, we combine both strategies to optimize network bandwidth and energy consumption for SMMS teleoperation systems. Specifically, we propose event-triggered control and communication schemes for a class of SMMS teleoperation systems using the TOD scheduling protocol. Considering dynamic uncertainties, the unavailability of relative velocities, and time-varying delays, we develop adaptive controllers with virtual observers based on event-triggered schemes to achieve master-slave synchronization. Stability criteria for the SMMS teleoperation systems under these event-triggered control and communication schemes are established, demonstrating that Zeno behavior is excluded. Finally, experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

Title: Cooperative Guidance for Aerial Defense in Multiagent Systems
Authors: Shivam Bajpai, Abhinav Sinha, Shashi Ranjan Kumar
Abstract: This paper addresses a critical aerial defense challenge in contested airspace, involving three autonomous aerial vehicles -- a hostile drone (the pursuer), a high-value drone (the evader), and a protective drone (the defender). We present a cooperative guidance framework for the evader-defender team that guarantees interception of the pursuer before it can capture the evader, even under highly dynamic and uncertain engagement conditions. Unlike traditional heuristic, optimal control, or differential game-based methods, we approach the problem within a time-constrained guidance framework, leveraging true proportional navigation based approach that ensures robust and guaranteed solutions to the aerial defense problem. The proposed strategy is computationally lightweight, scalable to a large number of agent configurations, and does not require knowledge of the pursuer's strategy or control laws. From arbitrary initial geometries, our method guarantees that key engagement errors are driven to zero within a fixed time, leading to a successful mission. Extensive simulations across diverse and adversarial scenarios confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy and its relevance for real-time autonomous defense in contested airspace environments.

Title: Sensing-Secure ISAC: Ambiguity Function Engineering for Impairing Unauthorized Sensing
Authors: Kawon Han, Kaitao Meng, Christos Masouros
Abstract: The deployment of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) brings along unprecedented vulnerabilities to authorized sensing, necessitating the development of secure solutions. Sensing parameters are embedded within the target-reflected signal leaked to unauthorized passive radar sensing eavesdroppers (Eve), implying that they can silently extract sensory information without prior knowledge of the information data. To overcome this limitation, we propose a sensing-secure ISAC framework that ensures secure target detection and estimation for the legitimate system, while obfuscating unauthorized sensing without requiring any prior knowledge of Eve. By introducing artificial imperfections into the ambiguity function (AF) of ISAC signals, we introduce artificial targets into Eve's range profile which increase its range estimation ambiguity. In contrast, the legitimate sensing receiver (Alice) can suppress these AF artifacts using mismatched filtering, albeit at the expense of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss. Employing an OFDM signal, a structured subcarrier power allocation scheme is designed to shape the secure autocorrelation function (ACF), inserting periodic peaks to mislead Eve's range estimation and degrade target detection performance. To quantify the sensing security, we introduce peak sidelobe level (PSL) and integrated sidelobe level (ISL) as key performance metrics. Then, we analyze the three-way trade-offs between communication, legitimate sensing, and sensing security, highlighting the impact of the proposed sensing-secure ISAC signaling on system performance. We formulate a convex optimization problem to maximize ISAC performance while guaranteeing a certain sensing security level. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed sensing-secure ISAC signaling, demonstrating its ability to degrade Eve's target estimation while preserving Alice's performance.

Title: Unlocking Symbol-Level Precoding Efficiency Through Tensor Equivariant Neural Network
Authors: Jinshuo Zhang, Yafei Wang, Xinping Yi, Wenjin Wang, Shi Jin, Symeon Chatzinotas, Björn Ottersten
Abstract: Although symbol-level precoding (SLP) based on constructive interference (CI) exploitation offers performance gains, its high complexity remains a bottleneck. This paper addresses this challenge with an end-to-end deep learning (DL) framework with low inference complexity that leverages the structure of the optimal SLP solution in the closed-form and its inherent tensor equivariance (TE), where TE denotes that a permutation of the input induces the corresponding permutation of the output. Building upon the computationally efficient model-based formulations, as well as their known closed-form solutions, we analyze their relationship with linear precoding (LP) and investigate the corresponding optimality condition. We then construct a mapping from the problem formulation to the solution and prove its TE, based on which the designed networks reveal a specific parameter-sharing pattern that delivers low computational complexity and strong generalization. Leveraging these, we propose the backbone of the framework with an attention-based TE module, achieving linear computational complexity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such a framework is also applicable to imperfect CSI scenarios, where we design a TE-based network to map the CSI, statistics, and symbols to auxiliary variables. Simulation results show that the proposed framework captures substantial performance gains of optimal SLP, while achieving an approximately 80-times speedup over conventional methods and maintaining strong generalization across user numbers and symbol block lengths.

Title: SpurBreast: A Curated Dataset for Investigating Spurious Correlations in Real-world Breast MRI Classification
Authors: Jong Bum Won, Wesley De Neve, Joris Vankerschaver, Utku Ozbulak
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in medical imaging, yet their real-world deployment remains challenging due to spurious correlations, where models can learn non-clinical features instead of meaningful medical patterns. Existing medical imaging datasets are not designed to systematically study this issue, largely due to restrictive licensing and limited supplementary patient data. To address this gap, we introduce SpurBreast, a curated breast MRI dataset that intentionally incorporates spurious correlations to evaluate their impact on model performance. Analyzing over 100 features involving patient, device, and imaging protocol, we identify two dominant spurious signals: magnetic field strength (a global feature influencing the entire image) and image orientation (a local feature affecting spatial alignment). Through controlled dataset splits, we demonstrate that DNNs can exploit these non-clinical signals, achieving high validation accuracy while failing to generalize to unbiased test data. Alongside these two datasets containing spurious correlations, we also provide benchmark datasets without spurious correlations, allowing researchers to systematically investigate clinically relevant and irrelevant features, uncertainty estimation, adversarial robustness, and generalization strategies. Models and datasets are available at this https URL.

Title: Recurrent Control Barrier Functions: A Path Towards Nonparametric Safety Verification
Authors: Jixian Liu, Enrique Mallada
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of complex dynamical systems often relies on Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) Reachability Analysis or Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). Both methods require computing a function that characterizes a safe set that can be made (control) invariant. However, the computational burden of solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (for HJ Reachability) or large-scale semidefinite programs (for CBFs) makes finding such functions challenging. In this paper, we introduce the notion of Recurrent Control Barrier Functions (RCBFs), a novel class of CBFs that leverages a recurrent property of the trajectories, i.e., coming back to a safe set, for safety verification. Under mild assumptions, we show that the RCBF condition holds for the signed-distance function, turning function design into set identification. Notably, the resulting set need not be invariant to certify safety. We further propose a data-driven nonparametric method to compute safe sets that is massively parallelizable and trades off conservativeness against computational cost.

Title: Detection and Identification of Sensor Attacks Using Data
Authors: Takumi Shinohara, Karl H. Johansson, Henrik Sandberg
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate data-driven attack detection and identification in a model-free setting. Unlike existing studies, we consider the case where the available output data include malicious false-data injections. We aim to detect and identify such attacks solely from the compromised data. We address this problem in two scenarios: (1) when the system operator is aware of the system's sparse observability condition, and (2) when the data are partially clean (i.e., attack-free). In both scenarios, we derive conditions and algorithms for detecting and identifying attacks using only the compromised data. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework via numerical simulations on a three-inertia system.

Title: Measurement-Guided Consistency Model Sampling for Inverse Problems
Authors: Amirreza Tanevardi, Pooria Abbas Rad Moghadam, Sajjad Amini
Abstract: Diffusion models have become powerful generative priors for solving inverse imaging problems, but their reliance on slow multi-step sampling limits practical deployment. Consistency models address this bottleneck by enabling high-quality generation in a single or only a few steps, yet their direct adaptation to inverse problems is underexplored. In this paper, we present a modified consistency sampling approach tailored for inverse problem reconstruction: the sampler's stochasticity is guided by a measurement-consistency mechanism tied to the measurement operator, which enforces fidelity to the acquired measurements while retaining the efficiency of consistency-based generation. Experiments on Fashion-MNIST and LSUN Bedroom datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in perceptual and pixel-level metrics, including Fréchet Inception Distance, Kernel Inception Distance, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and structural similarity index measure, compared to baseline consistency sampling, yielding competitive or superior reconstructions with only a handful of steps.

Title: Computing Control Lyapunov-Barrier Functions: Softmax Relaxation and Smooth Patching with Formal Guarantees
Authors: Jun Liu, Maxwell Fitzsimmons
Abstract: We present a computational framework for synthesizing a single smooth Lyapunov function that certifies both asymptotic stability and safety. We show that the existence of a strictly compatible pair of control barrier and control Lyapunov functions (CBF-CLF) guarantees the existence of such a function on the exact safe set certified by the barrier. To maximize the certifiable safe domain while retaining differentiability, we employ a log-sum-exp (softmax) relaxation of the nonsmooth maximum barrier, together with a counterexample-guided refinement that inserts half-space cuts until a strict barrier condition is verifiable. We then patch the softmax barrier with a CLF via an explicit smooth bump construction, which is always feasible under the strict compatibility condition. All conditions are formally verified using a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver, enabled by a reformulation of Farkas' lemma for encoding strict compatibility. On benchmark systems, including a power converter, we show that the certified safe stabilization regions obtained with the proposed approach are often less conservative than those achieved by state-of-the-art sum-of-squares (SOS) compatible CBF-CLF designs.

Title: Game-theoretic Social Distancing in Competitive Bi-Virus SIS Epidemics
Authors: Benjamin Catalano, Keith Paarporn, Sebin Gracy
Abstract: Numerous elements drive the spread of infectious diseases in complex real-world networks. Of particular interest is social behaviors that evolve in tandem with the spread of disease. Moreover, recent studies highlight the importance of understanding how multiple strains spread simultaneously through a population (e.g. Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2). In this paper, we propose a bi-virus SIS epidemic model coupled with a game-theoretic social distancing behavior model. The behaviors are governed by replicator equations from evolutionary game theory. The prevalence of each strain impacts the choice of an individual to social distance, and, in turn, their behavior affects the spread of each virus in the SIS model. Our analysis identifies equilibria of the system and their local stability properties, which reveal several isolated fixed points with varying levels of social distancing. We find that endemic co-existence is possible only when the reproduction numbers of both strains are equal. Assuming the reproduction number for each virus is the same, we identify suitable parameter regimes that give rise to lines of coexistence equilibria. Moreover, we also identify conditions for local exponential stability of said lines of equilibria. We illustrate our findings with several numerical simulations.

Title: Generating Differentially Private Networks with a Modified Erdős-Rényi Model
Authors: Huaiyuan Rao, Calvin Hawkins, Alexander Benvenuti, Matthew Hale
Abstract: Differential privacy has been used to privately calculate numerous network properties, but existing approaches often require the development of a new privacy mechanism for each property of interest. Therefore, we present a framework for generating entire networks in a differentially private way. Differential privacy is immune to post-processing, which allows for any network property to be computed and analyzed for a private output network, without weakening its protections. We consider undirected networks and develop a differential privacy mechanism that takes in a sensitive network and outputs a private network by randomizing its edge set. We prove that this mechanism does provide differential privacy to a network's edge set, though it induces a complex distribution over the space of output graphs. We then develop an equivalent privacy implementation using a modified Erdős-Rényi model that constructs an output graph edge by edge, and it is efficient and easily implementable, even on large complex networks. Experiments implement $\varepsilon$-differential privacy with $\varepsilon=2.5$ when computing graph Laplacian spectra, and these results show the proposed mechanism incurs $49.34\%$ less error than the current state of the art.

Title: Development and Evaluation of an AI-Driven Telemedicine System for Prenatal Healthcare
Authors: Juan Barrientos, Michaelle Pérez, Douglas González, Favio Reyna, Julio Fajardo, Andrea Lara
Abstract: Access to obstetric ultrasound is often limited in low-resource settings, particularly in rural areas of low- and middle-income countries. This work proposes a human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence (AI) system designed to assist midwives in acquiring diagnostically relevant fetal images using blind sweep protocols. The system incorporates a classification model along with a web-based platform for asynchronous specialist reviews. By identifying key frames in blind sweep studies, the AI system allows specialists to concentrate on interpretation rather than having to review entire videos. To evaluate its performance, blind sweep videos captured by a small group of soft-trained midwives using a low-cost Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) device were analyzed. The system demonstrated promising results in identifying standard fetal planes from sweeps made by non-experts. A field evaluation indicated good usability and a low cognitive workload, suggesting that it has the potential to expand access to prenatal imaging in underserved regions.

Title: Do Bias Benchmarks Generalise? Evidence from Voice-based Evaluation of Gender Bias in SpeechLLMs
Authors: Shree Harsha Bokkahalli Satish, Gustav Eje Henter, Éva Székely
Abstract: Recent work in benchmarking bias and fairness in speech large language models (SpeechLLMs) has relied heavily on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) formats. The model is tasked to choose between stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or neutral/irrelevant answers given an input speech prompt and an optional text prompt. Such MCQA benchmarks implicitly assume that model performance is consistent across other MCQA tasks, voices, and other task formats such as more realistic, long-form evaluations. In this paper, we probe that assumption. We fine-tune three SpeechLLMs using LoRA adapters to induce specific MCQA behaviours: preference for stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or neutral/uncertain answers. We then evaluate whether these behaviours generalise to another, distinct MCQA benchmark, and more critically to long-form, creative generation tasks. Our results show that performance on MCQA bias benchmarks fails to reliably predict performances across other MCQA benchmarks, and more importantly across long-form tasks. We conclude that current MCQA bias benchmarks show limited evidence of cross-task generalisation in the speech domain, and also propose an evaluation suite for measuring behaviour transferability in future models and benchmarks.

Title: Safe Reinforcement Learning-Based Vibration Control: Overcoming Training Risks with LQR Guidance
Authors: Rohan Vitthal Thorat, Juhi Singh, Rajdip Nayek
Abstract: Structural vibrations induced by external excitations pose significant risks, including safety hazards for occupants, structural damage, and increased maintenance costs. While conventional model-based control strategies, such as Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), effectively mitigate vibrations, their reliance on accurate system models necessitates tedious system identification. This tedious system identification process can be avoided by using a model-free Reinforcement learning (RL) method. RL controllers derive their policies solely from observed structural behaviour, eliminating the requirement for an explicit structural model. For an RL controller to be truly model-free, its training must occur on the actual physical system rather than in simulation. However, during this training phase, the RL controller lacks prior knowledge and it exerts control force on the structure randomly, which can potentially harm the structure. To mitigate this risk, we propose guiding the RL controller using a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. While LQR control typically relies on an accurate structural model for optimal performance, our observations indicate that even an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model outperforms the uncontrolled scenario. Motivated by this finding, we introduce a hybrid control framework that integrates both LQR and RL controllers. In this approach, the LQR policy is derived from a randomly selected model and its parameters. As this LQR policy does not require knowledge of the true or an approximate structural model the overall framework remains model-free. This hybrid approach eliminates dependency on explicit system models while minimizing exploration risks inherent in naive RL implementations. As per our knowledge, this is the first study to address the critical training safety challenge of RL-based vibration control and provide a validated solution.

Title: Ovi: Twin Backbone Cross-Modal Fusion for Audio-Video Generation
Authors: Chetwin Low, Weimin Wang, Calder Katyal
Abstract: Audio-video generation has often relied on complex multi-stage architectures or sequential synthesis of sound and visuals. We introduce Ovi, a unified paradigm for audio-video generation that models the two modalities as a single generative process. By using blockwise cross-modal fusion of twin-DiT modules, Ovi achieves natural synchronization and removes the need for separate pipelines or post hoc alignment. To facilitate fine-grained multimodal fusion modeling, we initialize an audio tower with an architecture identical to that of a strong pretrained video model. Trained from scratch on hundreds of thousands of hours of raw audio, the audio tower learns to generate realistic sound effects, as well as speech that conveys rich speaker identity and emotion. Fusion is obtained by jointly training the identical video and audio towers via blockwise exchange of timing (via scaled-RoPE embeddings) and semantics (through bidirectional cross-attention) on a vast video corpus. Our model enables cinematic storytelling with natural speech and accurate, context-matched sound effects, producing movie-grade video clips. All the demos, code and model weights are published at this https URL

Title: Integrated Security Mechanisms for Weight Protection in Memristive Crossbar Arrays
Authors: Muhammad Faheemur Rahman, Wayne Burleson
Abstract: Memristive crossbar arrays enable in-memory computing by performing parallel analog computations directly within memory, making them well-suited for machine learning, neural networks, and neuromorphic systems. However, despite their advantages, non-volatile memristors are vulnerable to security threats (such as adversarial extraction of stored weights when the hardware is compromised. Protecting these weights is essential since they represent valuable intellectual property resulting from lengthy and costly training processes using large, often proprietary, datasets. As a solution we propose two security mechanisms: Keyed Permutor and Watermark Protection Columns; where both safeguard critical weights and establish verifiable ownership (even in cases of data leakage). Our approach integrates efficiently with existing memristive crossbar architectures without significant design modifications. Simulations across 45nm, 22nm, and 7nm CMOS nodes, using a realistic interconnect model and a large RF dataset, show that both mechanisms offer robust protection with under 10% overhead in area, delay and power. We also present initial experiments employing the widely known MNIST dataset; further highlighting the feasibility of securing memristive in-memory computing systems with minimal performance trade-offs.

Title: DeMuon: A Decentralized Muon for Matrix Optimization over Graphs
Authors: Chuan He, Shuyi Ren, Jingwei Mao, Erik G. Larsson
Abstract: In this paper, we propose DeMuon, a method for decentralized matrix optimization over a given communication topology. DeMuon incorporates matrix orthogonalization via Newton-Schulz iterations-a technique inherited from its centralized predecessor, Muon-and employs gradient tracking to mitigate heterogeneity among local functions. Under heavy-tailed noise conditions and additional mild assumptions, we establish the iteration complexity of DeMuon for reaching an approximate stochastic stationary point. This complexity result matches the best-known complexity bounds of centralized algorithms in terms of dependence on the target tolerance. To the best of our knowledge, DeMuon is the first direct extension of Muon to decentralized optimization over graphs with provable complexity guarantees. We conduct preliminary numerical experiments on decentralized transformer pretraining over graphs with varying degrees of connectivity. Our numerical results demonstrate a clear margin of improvement of DeMuon over other popular decentralized algorithms across different network topologies.

Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are a powerful tool for ensuring the safety of autonomous systems, yet applying them to nonholonomic robots in cluttered, dynamic environments remains an open challenge. State-of-the-art methods often rely on collision-cone or velocity-obstacle constraints which, by only considering the angle of the relative velocity, are inherently conservative and can render the CBF-based quadratic program infeasible, particularly in dense scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a Dynamic Parabolic Control Barrier Function (DPCBF) that defines the safe set using a parabolic boundary. The parabola's vertex and curvature dynamically adapt based on both the distance to an obstacle and the magnitude of the relative velocity, creating a less restrictive safety constraint. We prove that the proposed DPCBF is valid for a kinematic bicycle model subject to input constraints. Extensive comparative simulations demonstrate that our DPCBF-based controller significantly enhances navigation success rates and QP feasibility compared to baseline methods. Our approach successfully navigates through dense environments with up to 100 dynamic obstacles, scenarios where collision cone-based methods fail due to infeasibility.

Title: Touching the tumor boundary: A pilot study on ultrasound based virtual fixtures for breast-conserving surgery
Authors: Laura Connolly, Tamas Ungi, Adnan Munawar, Anton Deguet, Chris Yeung, Russell H. Taylor, Parvin Mousavi, Gabor Fichtinger Keyvan Hashtrudi-Zaad
Abstract: Purpose: Delineating tumor boundaries during breast-conserving surgery is challenging as tumors are often highly mobile, non-palpable, and have irregularly shaped borders. To address these challenges, we introduce a cooperative robotic guidance system that applies haptic feedback for tumor localization. In this pilot study, we aim to assess if and how this system can be successfully integrated into breast cancer care. Methods: A small haptic robot is retrofitted with an electrocautery blade to operate as a cooperatively controlled surgical tool. Ultrasound and electromagnetic navigation are used to identify the tumor boundaries and position. A forbidden region virtual fixture is imposed when the surgical tool collides with the tumor boundary. We conducted a study where users were asked to resect tumors from breast simulants both with and without the haptic guidance. We then assess the results of these simulated resections both qualitatively and quantitatively. Results: Virtual fixture guidance is shown to improve resection margins. On average, users find the task to be less mentally demanding, frustrating, and effort intensive when haptic feedback is available. We also discovered some unanticipated impacts on surgical workflow that will guide design adjustments and training protocol moving forward. Conclusion: Our results suggest that virtual fixtures can help localize tumor boundaries in simulated breast-conserving surgery. Future work will include an extensive user study to further validate these results and fine-tune our guidance system.

Title: RealClass: A Framework for Classroom Speech Simulation with Public Datasets and Game Engines
Authors: Ahmed Adel Attia, Jing Liu, Carol Espy Wilson
Abstract: The scarcity of large-scale classroom speech data has hindered the development of AI-driven speech models for education. Classroom datasets remain limited and not publicly available, and the absence of dedicated classroom noise or Room Impulse Response (RIR) corpora prevents the use of standard data augmentation techniques. In this paper, we introduce a scalable methodology for synthesizing classroom noise and RIRs using game engines, a versatile framework that can extend to other domains beyond the classroom. Building on this methodology, we present RealClass, a dataset that combines a synthesized classroom noise corpus with a classroom speech dataset compiled from publicly available corpora. The speech data pairs a children's speech corpus with instructional speech extracted from YouTube videos to approximate real classroom interactions in clean conditions. Experiments on clean and noisy speech show that RealClass closely approximates real classroom speech, making it a valuable asset in the absence of abundant real classroom speech.

Title: Density-Ratio Weighted Behavioral Cloning: Learning Control Policies from Corrupted Datasets
Authors: Shriram Karpoora Sundara Pandian, Ali Baheri
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy optimization from fixed datasets, making it suitable for safety-critical applications where online exploration is infeasible. However, these datasets are often contaminated by adversarial poisoning, system errors, or low-quality samples, leading to degraded policy performance in standard behavioral cloning (BC) and offline RL methods. This paper introduces Density-Ratio Weighted Behavioral Cloning (Weighted BC), a robust imitation learning approach that uses a small, verified clean reference set to estimate trajectory-level density ratios via a binary discriminator. These ratios are clipped and used as weights in the BC objective to prioritize clean expert behavior while down-weighting or discarding corrupted data, without requiring knowledge of the contamination mechanism. We establish theoretical guarantees showing convergence to the clean expert policy with finite-sample bounds that are independent of the contamination rate. A comprehensive evaluation framework is established, which incorporates various poisoning protocols (reward, state, transition, and action) on continuous control benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that Weighted BC maintains near-optimal performance even at high contamination ratios outperforming baselines such as traditional BC, batch-constrained Q-learning (BCQ) and behavior regularized actor-critic (BRAC).

Title: Adversarial Social Influence: Modeling Persuasion in Contested Social Networks
Authors: Renukanandan Tumu, Cristian Ioan Vasile, Victor Preciado, Rahul Mangharam
Abstract: We present the Social Influence Game (SIG), a framework for modeling adversarial persuasion in social networks with an arbitrary number of competing players. Our goal is to provide a tractable and interpretable model of contested influence that scales to large systems while capturing the structural leverage points of networks. Each player allocates influence from a fixed budget to steer opinions that evolve under DeGroot dynamics, and we prove that the resulting optimization problem is a difference-of-convex program. To enable scalability, we develop an Iterated Linear (IL) solver that approximates player objectives with linear programs. In experiments on random and archetypical networks, IL achieves solutions within 7% of nonlinear solvers while being over 10x faster, scaling to large social networks. This paper lays a foundation for asymptotic analysis of contested influence in complex networks.

Title: Pose Estimation of a Thruster-Driven Bioinspired Multi-Link Robot
Authors: Nicholas B. Andrews, Yanhao Yang, Sofya Akhetova, Kristi A. Morgansen, Ross L. Hatton
Abstract: This work demonstrates pose (position and shape) estimation for a free-floating, bioinspired multi-link robot with unactuated joints, link-mounted thrusters for control, and a single gyroscope per link, resulting in an underactuated, minimally sensed platform. Through a proof-of-concept hardware experiment and offline Kalman filter analysis, we show that the robot's pose can be reliably estimated. State estimation is performed using an unscented Kalman filter augmented with Gaussian process residual learning to compensate for non-zero-mean, non-Gaussian noise. We further show that a filter trained on a multi-gait dataset (forward, backward, left, right, and turning) performs comparably to one trained on a larger forward-gait-only dataset when both are evaluated on the same forward-gait test trajectory. These results reveal overlap in the gait input space, which can be exploited to reduce training data requirements while enhancing the filter's generalizability across multiple gaits.

Title: CardioRAG: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework for Multimodal Chagas Disease Detection
Authors: Zhengyang Shen, Xuehao Zhai, Hua Tu, Mayue Shi
Abstract: Chagas disease affects nearly 6 million people worldwide, with Chagas cardiomyopathy representing its most severe complication. In regions where serological testing capacity is limited, AI-enhanced electrocardiogram (ECG) screening provides a critical diagnostic alternative. However, existing machine learning approaches face challenges such as limited accuracy, reliance on large labeled datasets, and more importantly, weak integration with evidence-based clinical diagnostic indicators. We propose a retrieval-augmented generation framework, CardioRAG, integrating large language models with interpretable ECG-based clinical features, including right bundle branch block, left anterior fascicular block, and heart rate variability metrics. The framework uses variational autoencoder-learned representations for semantic case retrieval, providing contextual cases to guide clinical reasoning. Evaluation demonstrated high recall performance of 89.80%, with a maximum F1 score of 0.68 for effective identification of positive cases requiring prioritized serological testing. CardioRAG provides an interpretable, clinical evidence-based approach particularly valuable for resource-limited settings, demonstrating a pathway for embedding clinical indicators into trustworthy medical AI systems.

Title: Bi-Virus SIS Epidemic Propagation under Mutation and Game-theoretic Protection Adoption
Authors: Urmee Maitra, Ashish R. Hota, Vaibhav Srivastava
Abstract: We study a bi-virus susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model in which individuals are either susceptible or infected with one of two virus strains, and consider mutation-driven transitions between strains. The general case of bi-directional mutation is first analyzed, where we characterize the disease-free equilibrium and establish its global asymptotic stability, as well as the existence, uniqueness, and stability of an endemic equilibrium. We then present a game-theoretic framework where susceptible individuals strategically choose whether to adopt protection or remain unprotected, to maximize their instantaneous payoffs. We derive Nash strategies under bi-directional mutation, and subsequently consider the special case of unidirectional mutation. In the latter case, we show that coexistence of both strains is impossible when mutation occurs from the strain with lower reproduction number and transmission rate to the other strain. Furthermore, we fully characterize the stationary Nash equilibrium (SNE) in the setting permitting coexistence, and examine how mutation rates influence protection adoption and infection prevalence at the SNE. Numerical simulations corroborate the analytical results, demonstrating that infection levels decrease monotonically with higher protection adoption, and highlight the impact of mutation rates and protection cost on infection state trajectories.

Title: NPN: Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space for Imaging Inverse Problems
Authors: Roman Jacome, Romario Gualdrón-Hurtado, Leon Suarez, Henry Arguello
Abstract: Imaging inverse problems aims to recover high-dimensional signals from undersampled, noisy measurements, a fundamentally ill-posed task with infinite solutions in the null-space of the sensing operator. To resolve this ambiguity, prior information is typically incorporated through handcrafted regularizers or learned models that constrain the solution space. However, these priors typically ignore the task-specific structure of that null-space. In this work, we propose \textit{Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space} (NPN), a novel class of regularization that, instead of enforcing structural constraints in the image domain, promotes solutions that lie in a low-dimensional projection of the sensing matrix's null-space with a neural network. Our approach has two key advantages: (1) Interpretability: by focusing on the structure of the null-space, we design sensing-matrix-specific priors that capture information orthogonal to the signal components that are fundamentally blind to the sensing process. (2) Flexibility: NPN is adaptable to various inverse problems, compatible with existing reconstruction frameworks, and complementary to conventional image-domain priors. We provide theoretical guarantees on convergence and reconstruction accuracy when used within plug-and-play methods. Empirical results across diverse sensing matrices demonstrate that NPN priors consistently enhance reconstruction fidelity in various imaging inverse problems, such as compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, with plug-and-play methods, unrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models.

Title: Next-Generation AI-Native Wireless Communications: MCMC-Based Receiver Architectures for Unified Processing
Authors: Xingyu Zhou, Le Liang, Jing Zhang, Chao-Kai Wen, Shi Jin
Abstract: The multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receiver processing is a key technology for current and next-generation wireless communications. However, it faces significant challenges related to complexity and scalability as the number of antennas increases. Artificial intelligence (AI), a cornerstone of next-generation wireless networks, offers considerable potential for addressing these challenges. This paper proposes an AI-driven, universal MIMO receiver architecture based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Unlike existing AI-based methods that treat receiver processing as a black box, our MCMC-based approach functions as a generic Bayesian computing engine applicable to various processing tasks, including channel estimation, symbol detection, and channel decoding. This method enhances the interpretability, scalability, and flexibility of receivers in diverse scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed approach integrates these tasks into a unified probabilistic framework, thereby enabling overall performance optimization. This unified framework can also be seamlessly combined with data-driven learning methods to facilitate the development of fully intelligent communication receivers.

Title: Geometric Backstepping Control of Omnidirectional Tiltrotors Incorporating Servo-Rotor Dynamics for Robustness against Sudden Disturbances
Authors: Jaewoo Lee, Dongjae Lee, Jinwoo Lee, Hyungyu Lee, Yeonjoon Kim, H. Jin Kim
Abstract: This work presents a geometric backstepping controller for a variable-tilt omnidirectional multirotor that explicitly accounts for both servo and rotor dynamics. Considering actuator dynamics is essential for more effective and reliable operation, particularly during aggressive flight maneuvers or recovery from sudden disturbances. While prior studies have investigated actuator-aware control for conventional and fixed-tilt multirotors, these approaches rely on linear relationships between actuator input and wrench, which cannot capture the nonlinearities induced by variable tilt angles. In this work, we exploit the cascade structure between the rigid-body dynamics of the multirotor and its nonlinear actuator dynamics to design the proposed backstepping controller and establish exponential stability of the overall system. Furthermore, we reveal parametric uncertainty in the actuator model through experiments, and we demonstrate that the proposed controller remains robust against such uncertainty. The controller was compared against a baseline that does not account for actuator dynamics across three experimental scenarios: fast translational tracking, rapid rotational tracking, and recovery from sudden disturbance. The proposed method consistently achieved better tracking performance, and notably, while the baseline diverged and crashed during the fastest translational trajectory tracking and the recovery experiment, the proposed controller maintained stability and successfully completed the tasks, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness.

Title: TalkPlay-Tools: Conversational Music Recommendation with LLM Tool Calling
Authors: Seungheon Doh, Keunwoo Choi, Juhan Nam
Abstract: While the recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have successfully enabled generative recommenders with natural language interactions, their recommendation behavior is limited, leaving other simpler yet crucial components such as metadata or attribute filtering underutilized in the system. We propose an LLM-based music recommendation system with tool calling to serve as a unified retrieval-reranking pipeline. Our system positions an LLM as an end-to-end recommendation system that interprets user intent, plans tool invocations, and orchestrates specialized components: boolean filters (SQL), sparse retrieval (BM25), dense retrieval (embedding similarity), and generative retrieval (semantic IDs). Through tool planning, the system predicts which types of tools to use, their execution order, and the arguments needed to find music matching user preferences, supporting diverse modalities while seamlessly integrating multiple database filtering methods. We demonstrate that this unified tool-calling framework achieves competitive performance across diverse recommendation scenarios by selectively employing appropriate retrieval methods based on user queries, envisioning a new paradigm for conversational music recommendation systems.

Title: Emotional Text-To-Speech Based on Mutual-Information-Guided Emotion-Timbre Disentanglement
Authors: Jianing Yang, Sheng Li, Takahiro Shinozaki, Yuki Saito, Hiroshi Saruwatari
Abstract: Current emotional Text-To-Speech (TTS) and style transfer methods rely on reference encoders to control global style or emotion vectors, but do not capture nuanced acoustic details of the reference speech. To this end, we propose a novel emotional TTS method that enables fine-grained phoneme-level emotion embedding prediction while disentangling intrinsic attributes of the reference speech. The proposed method employs a style disentanglement method to guide two feature extractors, reducing mutual information between timbre and emotion features, and effectively separating distinct style components from the reference speech. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline TTS systems in generating natural and emotionally rich speech. This work highlights the potential of disentangled and fine-grained representations in advancing the quality and flexibility of emotional TTS systems.

Title: Dual-Mode Magnetic Continuum Robot for Targeted Drug Delivery
Authors: Wendu Zhang, Heng Wang, Shuangyi Wang, Yuanrui Huang
Abstract: Magnetic continuum robots (MCRs) enable minimally invasive navigation through tortuous anatomical channels, yet axially magnetized designs have largely been limited to bending-only motion. To expand deformation capabilities, this paper presents a simple assembly that embeds permanent magnets radially within the catheter wall, allowing a single externally steered permanent magnet to independently induce either bending or torsion. A physics-based formulation together with finite-element analysis establishes the actuation principles, and benchtop experiments validate decoupled mode control under practical fields. Building on this, a dual-layer blockage mechanism consisting of outer grooves and inner plates leverages torsional shear to achieve on-demand drug release. Finally, an in-phantom intervention experiment demonstrates end-to-end operation: lumen following by bending for target approach, followed by twist-activated release at the site. The resulting compact, cable-free platform combines versatile deformation with precise payload delivery, indicating strong potential for next-generation, site-specific therapies.

Title: Robust MPC for Large-scale Linear Systems
Authors: Georg Schildbach
Abstract: State-of-the-art approaches of Robust Model Predictive Control (MPC) are restricted to linear systems of relatively small scale, i.e., with no more than about 5 states. The main reason is the computational burden of determining a robust positively invariant (RPI) set, whose complexity suffers from the curse of dimensionality. The recently proposed approach of Deadbeat Robust Model Predictive Control (DRMPC) is the first that does not rely on an RPI set. Yet it comes with the full set of essential system theoretic guarantees. DRMPC is hence a viable option, in particular, for large-scale systems. This paper introduces a detailed design procedure for DRMPC. It is shown that the optimal control problem generated for DRMPC has exactly the same computational complexity as Nominal MPC. A numerical study validates its applicability to randomly generated large-scale linear systems of various dimensions.

Title: SingMOS-Pro: An Comprehensive Benchmark for Singing Quality Assessment
Authors: Yuxun Tang, Lan Liu, Wenhao Feng, Yiwen Zhao, Jionghao Han, Yifeng Yu, Jiatong Shi, Qin Jin
Abstract: Singing voice generation progresses rapidly, yet evaluating singing quality remains a critical challenge. Human subjective assessment, typically in the form of listening tests, is costly and time consuming, while existing objective metrics capture only limited perceptual aspects. In this work, we introduce SingMOS-Pro, a dataset for automatic singing quality assessment. Building on our preview version SingMOS, which provides only overall ratings, SingMOS-Pro expands annotations of the additional part to include lyrics, melody, and overall quality, offering broader coverage and greater diversity. The dataset contains 7,981 singing clips generated by 41 models across 12 datasets, spanning from early systems to recent advances. Each clip receives at least five ratings from professional annotators, ensuring reliability and consistency. Furthermore, we explore how to effectively utilize MOS data annotated under different standards and benchmark several widely used evaluation methods from related tasks on SingMOS-Pro, establishing strong baselines and practical references for future research. The dataset can be accessed at this https URL.

Title: HRTFformer: A Spatially-Aware Transformer for Personalized HRTF Upsampling in Immersive Audio Rendering
Authors: Xuyi Hu, Jian Li, Shaojie Zhang, Stefan Goetz, Lorenzo Picinali, Ozgur B. Akan, Aidan O. T. Hogg
Abstract: Personalized Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) are starting to be introduced in many commercial immersive audio applications and are crucial for realistic spatial audio rendering. However, one of the main hesitations regarding their introduction is that creating personalized HRTFs is impractical at scale due to the complexities of the HRTF measurement process. To mitigate this drawback, HRTF spatial upsampling has been proposed with the aim of reducing measurements required. While prior work has seen success with different machine learning (ML) approaches, these models often struggle with long-range spatial consistency and generalization at high upsampling factors. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based architecture for HRTF upsampling, leveraging the attention mechanism to better capture spatial correlations across the HRTF sphere. Working in the spherical harmonic (SH) domain, our model learns to reconstruct high-resolution HRTFs from sparse input measurements with significantly improved accuracy. To enhance spatial coherence, we introduce a neighbor dissimilarity loss that promotes magnitude smoothness, yielding more realistic upsampling. We evaluate our method using both perceptual localization models and objective spectral distortion metrics. Experiments show that our model surpasses leading methods by a substantial margin in generating realistic, high-fidelity HRTFs.

Title: MelCap: A Unified Single-Codebook Neural Codec for High-Fidelity Audio Compression
Authors: Jingyi Li, Zhiyuan Zhao, Yunfei Liu, Lijian Lin, Ye Zhu, Jiahao Wu, Qiuqiang Kong, Yu Li
Abstract: Neural audio codecs have recently emerged as powerful tools for high-quality and low-bitrate audio compression, leveraging deep generative models to learn latent representations of audio signals. However, existing approaches either rely on a single quantizer that only processes speech domain, or on multiple quantizers that are not well suited for downstream tasks. To address this issue, we propose MelCap, a unified "one-codebook-for-all" neural codec that effectively handles speech, music, and general sound. By decomposing audio reconstruction into two stages, our method preserves more acoustic details than previous single-codebook approaches, while achieving performance comparable to mainstream multi-codebook methods. In the first stage, audio is transformed into mel-spectrograms, which are compressed and quantized into compact single tokens using a 2D tokenizer. A perceptual loss is further applied to mitigate the over-smoothing artifacts observed in spectrogram reconstruction. In the second stage, a Vocoder recovers waveforms from the mel discrete tokens in a single forward pass, enabling real-time decoding. Both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that MelCap achieves quality on comparable to state-of-the-art multi-codebook codecs, while retaining the computational simplicity of a single-codebook design, thereby providing an effective representation for downstream tasks.

Title: Automated Defect Detection for Mass-Produced Electronic Components Based on YOLO Object Detection Models
Authors: Wei-Lung Mao, Chun-Chi Wang, Po-Heng Chou, Yen-Ting Liu
Abstract: Since the defect detection of conventional industry components is time-consuming and labor-intensive, it leads to a significant burden on quality inspection personnel and makes it difficult to manage product quality. In this paper, we propose an automated defect detection system for the dual in-line package (DIP) that is widely used in industry, using digital camera optics and a deep learning (DL)-based model. The two most common defect categories of DIP are examined: (1) surface defects, and (2) pin-leg defects. However, the lack of defective component images leads to a challenge for detection tasks. To solve this problem, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a suitable-sized dataset for training and testing. Four varieties of the YOLO model are investigated (v3, v4, v7, and v9), both in isolation and with the ConSinGAN augmentation. The proposed YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN is superior to the other YOLO versions in accuracy of 95.50\%, detection time of 285 ms, and is far superior to threshold-based approaches. In addition, the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is developed, and the associated sensor architecture is described. The proposed automated defect detection can be easily established with numerous types of defects or insufficient defect data.

Title: Exploring Resolution-Wise Shared Attention in Hybrid Mamba-U-Nets for Improved Cross-Corpus Speech Enhancement
Authors: Nikolai Lund Kühne, Jesper Jensen, Jan Østergaard, Zheng-Hua Tan
Abstract: Recent advances in speech enhancement have shown that models combining Mamba and attention mechanisms yield superior cross-corpus generalization performance. At the same time, integrating Mamba in a U-Net structure has yielded state-of-the-art enhancement performance, while reducing both model size and computational complexity. Inspired by these insights, we propose RWSA-MambaUNet, a novel and efficient hybrid model combining Mamba and multi-head attention in a U-Net structure for improved cross-corpus performance. Resolution-wise shared attention (RWSA) refers to layerwise attention-sharing across corresponding time- and frequency resolutions. Our best-performing RWSA-MambaUNet model achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on two out-of-domain test sets. Notably, our smallest model surpasses all baselines on the out-of-domain DNS 2020 test set in terms of PESQ, SSNR, and ESTOI, and on the out-of-domain EARS-WHAM_v2 test set in terms of SSNR, ESTOI, and SI-SDR, while using less than half the model parameters and a fraction of the FLOPs.

Title: Multi-bit Audio Watermarking
Authors: Luca A. Lanzendörfer, Kyle Fearne, Florian Grötschla, Roger Wattenhofer
Abstract: We present Timbru, a post-hoc audio watermarking model that achieves state-of-the-art robustness and imperceptibility trade-offs without training an embedder-detector model. Given any 44.1 kHz stereo music snippet, our method performs per-audio gradient optimization to add imperceptible perturbations in the latent space of a pretrained audio VAE, guided by a combined message and perceptual loss. The watermark can then be extracted using a pretrained CLAP model. We evaluate 16-bit watermarking on MUSDB18-HQ against AudioSeal, WavMark, and SilentCipher across common filtering, noise, compression, resampling, cropping, and regeneration attacks. Our approach attains the best average bit error rates, while preserving perceptual quality, demonstrating an efficient, dataset-free path to imperceptible audio watermarking.

Title: SPARC: Spine with Prismatic and Revolute Compliance for Quadruped Robot
Authors: Yue Wang
Abstract: We present SPARC, a compact, open-source 3-DoF sagittal-plane spine module that combines revolute (pitch) and prismatic (axial) motion with programmable task-space impedance for quadruped robots. The system integrates three torque-controlled actuators, a custom 1 kHz control board, and a protected power unit in a 1.26 kg package, enabling closed-loop stiffness and damping shaping along x, z, and theta. We develop an RNEA-based computed-acceleration controller with smooth Stribeck friction compensation to render spring-damper behavior without explicit inertia shaping. Bench experiments validate the approach. Quasi-static push-pull tests show linear force-displacement characteristics with commanded horizontal stiffness spanning 300-700 N/m and <= 1.5% relative error (R^2 >= 0.992, narrow 95% CIs). Dynamic displace-and-release trials confirm mass-spring-damper responses over multiple damping settings, with small, interpretable phase deviations due to configuration-dependent inertia and low-speed friction effects. A task-space PD controller produces roughly linear stiffness but with greater variability and coupling sensitivity. SPARC provides a portable platform for systematic studies of spine compliance in legged locomotion and will be released with complete hardware and firmware resources.

Title: Reducing Discomfort in Driving Simulators: Motion Cueing for Motion Sickness Mitigation
Authors: Varun Kotian, Vishrut Jain, Andrea Michelle Rios Lazcano, Daan Marinus Pool, Riender Happee, Barys Shyrokau
Abstract: Driving simulators are increasingly used in research and development. However, simulators often cause motion sickness due to downscaled motion and unscaled veridical visuals. In this paper, a motion cueing algorithm is proposed that reduces motion sickness as predicted by the subjective vertical conflict (SVC) model using model predictive control (MPC). Both sensory conflict and specific force errors are penalised in the cost function, allowing the algorithm to jointly optimise fidelity and comfort. Human-in-the-loop experiments were conducted to compare four simulator motion settings: two variations of our MPC-based algorithm, one focused on pure specific force tracking and the second compromising specific force tracking and motion sickness minimisation, as well as reference adaptive washout and no motion cases. The experiments were performed on a hexapod driving simulator with participants exposed to passive driving. Experimental motion sickness results closely matched the sickness model predictions. As predicted by the model, the no motion condition yielded the lowest sickness levels. However, it was rated lowest in terms of fidelity. The compromise solution reduced sickness by over 50% (average MISC level 3 to 1.5) compared to adaptive washout and the algorithm focusing on specific force tracking, without any significant reduction in fidelity rating. The proposed approach for developing MCA that takes into account both the simulator dynamics and time evolution of motion sickness offers a significant advancement in achieving an optimal control of motion sickness and specific force recreation in driving simulators, supporting broader simulator use.

Lips, Francesco Ciompi, Frédérique Meeuwsen, Jeroen van der Laak
Abstract: Automated semantic segmentation of whole-slide images (WSIs) stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) is essential for large-scale artificial intelligence-based biomarker analysis in breast cancer. However, existing public datasets for breast cancer segmentation lack the morphological diversity needed to support model generalizability and robust biomarker validation across heterogeneous patient cohorts. We introduce BrEast cancEr hisTopathoLogy sEgmentation (BEETLE), a dataset for multiclass semantic segmentation of H&E-stained breast cancer WSIs. It consists of 587 biopsies and resections from three collaborating clinical centers and two public datasets, digitized using seven scanners, and covers all molecular subtypes and histological grades. Using diverse annotation strategies, we collected annotations across four classes - invasive epithelium, non-invasive epithelium, necrosis, and other - with particular focus on morphologies underrepresented in existing datasets, such as ductal carcinoma in situ and dispersed lobular tumor cells. The dataset's diversity and relevance to the rapidly growing field of automated biomarker quantification in breast cancer ensure its high potential for reuse. Finally, we provide a well-curated, multicentric external evaluation set to enable standardized benchmarking of breast cancer segmentation models.

Title: Stream RAG: Instant and Accurate Spoken Dialogue Systems with Streaming Tool Usage

Abstract: End-to-end speech-in speech-out dialogue systems are emerging as a powerful alternative to traditional ASR-LLM-TTS pipelines, generating more natural, expressive responses with significantly lower latency. However, these systems remain prone to hallucinations due to limited factual grounding. While text-based dialogue systems address this challenge by integrating tools such as web search and knowledge graph APIs, we introduce the first approach to extend tool use directly into speech-in speech-out systems. A key challenge is that tool integration substantially increases response latency, disrupting conversational flow. To mitigate this, we propose Streaming Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Streaming RAG), a novel framework that reduces user-perceived latency by predicting tool queries in parallel with user speech, even before the user finishes speaking. Specifically, we develop a post-training pipeline that teaches the model when to issue tool calls during ongoing speech and how to generate spoken summaries that fuse audio queries with retrieved text results, thereby improving both accuracy and responsiveness. To evaluate our approach, we construct AudioCRAG, a benchmark created by converting queries from the publicly available CRAG dataset into speech form. Experimental results demonstrate that our streaming RAG approach increases QA accuracy by up to 200% relative (from 11.1% to 34.2% absolute) and further enhances user experience by reducing tool use latency by 20%. Importantly, our streaming RAG approach is modality-agnostic and can be applied equally to typed input, paving the way for more agentic, real-time AI assistants.

Title: LLM-Enhanced, Data-Driven Personalized and Equitable Clinician Scheduling: A Predict-then-Optimize Approach
Authors: Anjali Jha, Wanqing Chen, Maxim Eckmann, Ian Stockwell, Jianwu Wang, Kai Sun
Abstract: Clinician scheduling remains a persistent challenge due to limited clinical resources and fluctuating demands. This complexity is especially acute in large academic anesthesiology departments as physicians balance responsibilities across multiple clinical sites with conflicting priorities. Further, scheduling must account for individual clinical and lifestyle preferences to ensure job satisfaction and well-being. Traditional approaches, often based on statistical or rule-based optimization models, rely on structured data and explicit domain knowledge. However, these methods often overlook unstructured information, e.g., free-text notes from routinely administered clinician well-being surveys and scheduling platforms. These notes may reveal implicit and underutilized clinical resources. Neglecting such information can lead to misaligned schedules, increased burnout, overlooked staffing flexibility, and suboptimal utilization of available resources. To address this gap, we propose a predict-then-optimize framework that integrates classification-based clinician availability predictions with a mixed-integer programming schedule optimization model. Large language models (LLMs) are employed to extract actionable preferences and implicit constraints from unstructured schedule notes, enhancing the reliability of availability predictions. These predictions then inform the schedule optimization considering four objectives: first, ensuring clinical full-time equivalent compliance, second, reducing workload imbalances by enforcing equitable proportions of shift types, third, maximizing clinician availability for assigned shifts, and fourth, schedule consistency. By combining the interpretive power of LLMs with the rigor of mathematical optimization, our framework provides a robust, data-driven solution that enhances operational efficiency while supporting equity and clinician well-being.

Title: Variational Secret Common Randomness Extraction
Authors: Xinyang Li, Vlad C. Andrei, Peter J. Gu, Yiqi Chen, Ullrich J. Mönich, Holger Boche
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of extracting common randomness (CR) or secret keys from correlated random sources observed by two legitimate parties, Alice and Bob, through public discussion in the presence of an eavesdropper, Eve. We propose a practical two-stage CR extraction framework. In the first stage, the variational probabilistic quantization (VPQ) step is introduced, where Alice and Bob employ probabilistic neural network (NN) encoders to map their observations into discrete, nearly uniform random variables (RVs) with high agreement probability while minimizing information leakage to Eve. This is realized through a variational learning objective combined with adversarial training. In the second stage, a secure sketch using code-offset construction reconciles the encoder outputs into identical secret keys, whose secrecy is guaranteed by the VPQ objective. As a representative application, we study physical layer key (PLK) generation. Beyond the traditional methods, which rely on the channel reciprocity principle and require two-way channel probing, thus suffering from large protocol overhead and being unsuitable in high mobility scenarios, we propose a sensing-based PLK generation method for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, where paired range-angle (RA) maps measured at Alice and Bob serve as correlated sources. The idea is verified through both end-to-end simulations and real-world software-defined radio (SDR) measurements, including scenarios where Eve has partial knowledge about Bob's position. The results demonstrate the feasibility and convincing performance of both the proposed CR extraction framework and sensing-based PLK generation method.

Title: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Streaming Full-Duplex End-to-End Spoken Dialogue Systems
Authors: Siddhant Arora, Jinchuan Tian, Hayato Futami, Jiatong Shi, Yosuke Kashiwagi, Emiru Tsunoo, Shinji Watanabe
Abstract: Most end-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue systems (SDS) rely on voice activity detection (VAD) for turn-taking, but VAD fails to distinguish between pauses and turn completions. Duplex SDS models address this by predicting output continuously, including silence tokens, thus removing the need for explicit VAD. However, they often have complex dual-channel architecture and lag behind cascaded models in semantic reasoning. To overcome these challenges, we propose SCoT: a Streaming Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework for Duplex SDS, alternating between processing fixed-duration user input and generating responses in a blockwise manner. Using frame-level alignments, we create intermediate targets-aligned user transcripts and system responses for each block. Experiments show that our approach produces more coherent and interpretable responses than existing duplex methods while supporting lower-latency and overlapping interactions compared to turn-by-turn systems.

Title: SoundReactor: Frame-level Online Video-to-Audio Generation
Authors: Koichi Saito, Julian Tanke, Christian Simon, Masato Ishii, Kazuki Shimada, Zachary Novack, Zhi Zhong, Akio Hayakawa, Takashi Shibuya, Yuki Mitsufuji
Abstract: Prevailing Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation models operate offline, assuming an entire video sequence or chunks of frames are available beforehand. This critically limits their use in interactive applications such as live content creation and emerging generative world models. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task of frame-level online V2A generation, where a model autoregressively generates audio from video without access to future video frames. Furthermore, we propose SoundReactor, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first simple yet effective framework explicitly tailored for this task. Our design enforces end-to-end causality and targets low per-frame latency with audio-visual synchronization. Our model's backbone is a decoder-only causal transformer over continuous audio latents. For vision conditioning, it leverages grid (patch) features extracted from the smallest variant of the DINOv2 vision encoder, which are aggregated into a single token per frame to maintain end-to-end causality and efficiency. The model is trained through a diffusion pre-training followed by consistency fine-tuning to accelerate the diffusion head decoding. On a benchmark of diverse gameplay videos from AAA titles, our model successfully generates semantically and temporally aligned, high-quality full-band stereo audio, validated by both objective and human evaluations. Furthermore, our model achieves low per-frame waveform-level latency (26.3ms with the head NFE=1, 31.5ms with NFE=4) on 30FPS, 480p videos using a single H100. Demo samples are available at this https URL.

Title: On the (almost) Global Exponential Convergence of the Overparameterized Policy Optimization for the LQR Problem
Authors: Moh Kamalul Wafi, Arthur Castello B. de Oliveira, Eduardo D. Sontag
Abstract: In this work we study the convergence of gradient methods for nonconvex optimization problems -- specifically the effect of the problem formulation to the convergence behavior of the solution of a gradient flow. We show through a simple example that, surprisingly, the gradient flow solution can be exponentially or asymptotically convergent, depending on how the problem is formulated. We then deepen the analysis and show that a policy optimization strategy for the continuous-time linear quadratic regulator (LQR) (which is known to present only asymptotic convergence globally) presents almost global exponential convergence if the problem is overparameterized through a linear feed-forward neural network (LFFNN). We prove this qualitative improvement always happens for a simplified version of the LQR problem and derive explicit convergence rates for the gradient flow. Finally, we show that both the qualitative improvement and the quantitative rate gains persist in the general LQR through numerical simulations.

Title: Product Digital Twin Supporting End-of-life Phase of Electric Vehicle Batteries Utilizing Product-Process-Resource Asset Network
Authors: Sara Strakosova, Petr Novak, Petr Kadera
Abstract: In the context of the circular economy, products in their end-of-life phase should be either remanufactured or recycled. Both of these processes are crucial for sustainability and environmental conservation. However, manufacturers often do not support these processes enough by not sharing relevant data. This paper proposes use of a digital twin technology, which is capable to help optimizing the disassembly processes to reduce ecological impact and enhance sustainability. The proposed approach is demonstrated through a disassembly use-case of the product digital twin of an electric vehicle battery. By utilizing product digital twins, challenges associated with the disassembly of electric vehicle batteries can be solved flexibly and efficiently for various battery types. As a backbone for the product digital twin representation, the paper uses the paradigm of product-process-resource asset networks (PAN). Such networks enable to model relevant relationships across products, production resources, manufacturing processes, and specific production operations that have to be done in the manufacturing phase of a product. This paper introduces a Bi-Flow Product-Process-Resource Asset Network (Bi-PAN) representation, which extends the PAN paradigm to cover not only the manufacturing, but also the remanufacturing/recycling phase.

Title: Go witheFlow: Real-time Emotion Driven Audio Effects Modulation
Authors: Edmund Dervakos, Spyridon Kantarelis, Vassilis Lyberatos, Jason Liartis, Giorgos Stamou
Abstract: Music performance is a distinctly human activity, intrinsically linked to the performer's ability to convey, evoke, or express emotion. Machines cannot perform music in the human sense; they can produce, reproduce, execute, or synthesize music, but they lack the capacity for affective or emotional experience. As such, music performance is an ideal candidate through which to explore aspects of collaboration between humans and machines. In this paper, we introduce the witheFlow system, designed to enhance real-time music performance by automatically modulating audio effects based on features extracted from both biosignals and the audio itself. The system, currently in a proof-of-concept phase, is designed to be lightweight, able to run locally on a laptop, and is open-source given the availability of a compatible Digital Audio Workstation and sensors.

Title: EvolveCaptions: Empowering DHH Users Through Real-Time Collaborative Captioning
Authors: Liang-Yuan Wu, Dhruv Jain
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems often fail to accurately transcribe speech from Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) individuals, especially during real-time conversations. Existing personalization approaches typically require extensive pre-recorded data and place the burden of adaptation on the DHH speaker. We present EvolveCaptions, a real-time, collaborative ASR adaptation system that supports in-situ personalization with minimal effort. Hearing participants correct ASR errors during live conversations. Based on these corrections, the system generates short, phonetically targeted prompts for the DHH speaker to record, which are then used to fine-tune the ASR model. In a study with 12 DHH and six hearing participants, EvolveCaptions reduced Word Error Rate (WER) across all DHH users within one hour of use, using only five minutes of recording time on average. Participants described the system as intuitive, low-effort, and well-integrated into communication. These findings demonstrate the promise of collaborative, real-time ASR adaptation for more equitable communication.

Title: High-Fidelity Speech Enhancement via Discrete Audio Tokens
Authors: Luca A. Lanzendörfer, Frédéric Berdoz, Antonis Asonitis, Roger Wattenhofer
Abstract: Recent autoregressive transformer-based speech enhancement (SE) methods have shown promising results by leveraging advanced semantic understanding and contextual modeling of speech. However, these approaches often rely on complex multi-stage pipelines and low sampling rate codecs, limiting them to narrow and task-specific speech enhancement. In this work, we introduce DAC-SE1, a simplified language model-based SE framework leveraging discrete high-resolution audio representations; DAC-SE1 preserves fine-grained acoustic details while maintaining semantic coherence. Our experiments show that DAC-SE1 surpasses state-of-the-art autoregressive SE methods on both objective perceptual metrics and in a MUSHRA human evaluation. We release our codebase and model checkpoints to support further research in scalable, unified, and high-quality speech enhancement.

Title: Joint Channel and Semantic-aware Grouping for Effective Collaborative Edge Inference
Authors: Mateus P. Mota, Mattia Merluzzi, Emilio Calvanese Strinati
Abstract: We focus on collaborative edge inference over wireless, which enables multiple devices to cooperate to improve inference performance in the presence of corrupted data. Exploiting a key-query mechanism for selective information exchange (or, group formation for collaboration), we recall the effect of wireless channel impairments in feature communication. We argue and show that a disjoint approach, which only considers either the semantic relevance or channel state between devices, performs poorly, especially in harsh propagation conditions. Based on these findings, we propose a joint approach that takes into account semantic information relevance and channel states when grouping devices for collaboration, by making the general attention weights dependent of the channel information. Numerical simulations show the superiority of the joint approach against local inference on corrupted data, as well as compared to collaborative inference with disjoint decisions that either consider application or physical layer parameters when forming groups.

Title: Authentication Security of PRF GNSS Ranging
Authors: Jason Anderson
Abstract: This work derives the authentication security of pseudorandom function (PRF) GNSS ranging under multiple GNSS spoofing models, including the Security Code Estimation and Replay (SCER) spoofer. When GNSS ranging codes derive from a PRF utilizing a secret known only to the broadcaster, the spoofer cannot predict the ranging code before broadcast. Therefore, PRF ranging can be used to establish trust in the GNSS pseudoranges and the resulting receiver position, navigation, and timing (PNT) solution. I apply the methods herein to Galileo's Signal Authentication Service (SAS) utilizing the encrypted Galileo E6-C signal to compute that, at most, 400 ms of Galileo E6-C data to assert 128-bit authentication security under non-SCER models. For the SCER adversary, I predict the adversary's needed receiving radio equipment to break authentication security. One can use this work to design a PRF GNSS ranging protocol to meet useful authentication security requirements by computing the probability of missed detection.

Title: Collaborative Edge Inference via Semantic Grouping under Wireless Channel Constraints
Authors: Mateus P. Mota, Mattia Merluzzi, Emilio Calvanese Strinati
Abstract: In this paper, we study the framework of collaborative inference, or edge ensembles. This framework enables multiple edge devices to improve classification accuracy by exchanging intermediate features rather than raw observations. However, efficient communication strategies are essential to balance accuracy and bandwidth limitations. Building upon a key-query mechanism for selective information exchange, this work extends collaborative inference by studying the impact of channel noise in feature communication, the choice of intermediate collaboration points, and the communication-accuracy trade-off across tasks. By analyzing how different collaboration points affect performance and exploring communication pruning, we show that it is possible to optimize accuracy while minimizing resource usage. We show that the intermediate collaboration approach is robust to channel errors and that the query transmission needs a higher degree of reliability than the data transmission itself.

Title: How to Combat Reactive and Dynamic Jamming Attacks with Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Yalin E. Sagduyu, Tugba Erpek, Kemal Davaslioglu, Sastry Kompella
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of mitigating reactive jamming, where a jammer adopts a dynamic policy of selecting channels and sensing thresholds to detect and jam ongoing transmissions. The transmitter-receiver pair learns to avoid jamming and optimize throughput over time (without prior knowledge of channel conditions or jamming strategies) by using reinforcement learning (RL) to adapt transmit power, modulation, and channel selection. Q-learning is employed for discrete jamming-event states, while Deep Q-Networks (DQN) are employed for continuous states based on received power. Through different reward functions and action sets, the results show that RL can adapt rapidly to spectrum dynamics and sustain high rates as channels and jamming policies change over time.

Title: SUPER-Net: Trustworthy Image Segmentation via Uncertainty Propagation in Encoder-Decoder Networks
Authors: Giuseppina Carannante, Nidhal C.Bouaynaya, Dimah Dera, Hassan M. Fathallah-Shaykh, Ghulam Rasool
Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) holds great promise in reshaping the industry owing to its precision, efficiency, and objectivity. However, the brittleness of DL models to noisy and out-of-distribution inputs is ailing their deployment in sensitive fields. Current models often lack uncertainty quantification, providing only point estimates. We propose SUPER-Net, a Bayesian framework for trustworthy image segmentation via uncertainty propagation. Using Taylor series approximations, SUPER-Net propagates the mean and covariance of the model's posterior distribution across nonlinear layers. It generates two outputs simultaneously: the segmented image and a pixel-wise uncertainty map, eliminating the need for expensive Monte Carlo sampling. SUPER-Net's performance is extensively evaluated on MRI and CT scans under various noisy and adversarial conditions. Results show that SUPER-Net outperforms state-of-the-art models in robustness and accuracy. The uncertainty map identifies low-confidence areas affected by noise or attacks, allowing the model to self-assess segmentation reliability, particularly when errors arise from noise or adversarial examples.

Title: Cyber-physical WebAssembly: Secure Hardware Interfaces and Pluggable Drivers
Authors: Michiel Van Kenhove, Maximilian Seidler, Friedrich Vandenberghe, Warre Dujardin, Wouter Hennen, Arne Vogel, Merlijn Sebrechts, Tom Goethals, Filip De Turck, Bruno Volckaert
Abstract: The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT), edge, and embedded devices in the past decade has introduced numerous challenges in terms of security and configuration management. Simultaneously, advances in cloud-native development practices have greatly enhanced the development experience and facilitated quicker updates, thereby enhancing application security. However, applying these advances to IoT, edge, and embedded devices remains a complex task, primarily due to the heterogeneous environments and the need to support devices with extended lifespans. WebAssembly and the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) has emerged as a promising technology to bridge this gap. As WebAssembly becomes more popular on IoT, edge, and embedded devices, there is a growing demand for hardware interface support in WebAssembly programs. This work presents WASI proposals and proof-of-concept implementations to enable hardware interaction with I2C and USB, which are two commonly used protocols in IoT, directly from WebAssembly applications. This is achieved by running the device drivers within WebAssembly as well. A thorough evaluation of the proof of concepts shows that WASI-USB introduces a minimal overhead of at most 8% compared to native operating system USB APIs. However, the results show that runtime initialization overhead can be significant in low-latency applications.

Title: Antenna Coding Empowered by Pixel Antennas
Authors: Shanpu Shen, Kai-Kit Wong, Ross Murch
Abstract: Pixel antennas, based on discretizing a continuous radiation surface into small elements called pixels, are a flexible reconfigurable antenna technology. By controlling the connections between pixels via switches, the characteristics of pixel antennas can be adjusted to enhance the wireless channel. Inspired by this, we propose a novel technique denoted antenna coding empowered by pixel antennas. We first derive a physical and electromagnetic based communication model for pixel antennas using microwave multiport network theory and beamspace channel representation. With the model, we optimize the antenna coding to maximize the channel gain in a single-input single-output (SISO) pixel antenna system and develop a codebook design for antenna coding to reduce the computational complexity. We analyze the average channel gain of SISO pixel antenna system and derive the corresponding upper bound. In addition, we jointly optimize the antenna coding and transmit signal covariance matrix to maximize the channel capacity in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) pixel antenna system. Simulation results show that using pixel antennas can enhance the average channel gain by up to 5.4 times and channel capacity by up to 3.1 times, demonstrating the significant potential of pixel antennas as a new dimension to design and optimize wireless communication systems.

Title: Sliced Distribution Matching based on Cumulative Distribution Functions with Applications to Control
Authors: Alexandros E. Tzikas, Arec Jamgochian, Nazim Kemal Ure, Mykel J. Kochenderfer, Stephen P. Boyd
Abstract: Computing the similarity between two probability distributions is a recurring theme across control. We introduce a unified family of distances between the probability distributions of two random variables that is based on the discrepancy between the cumulative distribution functions of random linear one-dimensional projections of the random variables. Our proposed distance is interpretable, computationally simple, and admits a differentiable approximation. We establish asymptotic theoretical guarantees for sample-based estimators of the distance. We empirically study the use of the distance in a two-sample test and demonstrate its ability to distinguish different distributions. Finally, we show that the distance allows for simple gradient-based solutions in control by studying distribution steering and ergodic control.

Title: A Fractional-Order Nonlinear Backstepping Controller Design for Current-Controlled Maglev System
Authors: Dorukhan Astekin, Fatih Adıgüzel
Abstract: The magnetic levitation system (Maglev) is a nonlinear system by which an object is suspended with no support other than magnetic fields. The main control perspective of the Maglev system is to levitate a steel ball in air by the electromagnetic force. However, the Maglev system has highly nonlinear dynamics which is inconvenient in the sense of sensitive control/regulation of its nonlinear dynamics. In this paper, the nonlinear backstepping controller based on the fractional-order derivative is proposed for the control of the nonlinear current-controlled Maglev system. After, the system dynamics and fractional-order backstepping controller design are given, the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is proved by employing the Lyapunov theory. Some computer-based numerical experiments are carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller for the control of Maglev system.

Title: On the Standard Performance Criteria for Applied Control Design: PID, MPC or Machine Learning Controller?
Authors: Pouria Sarhadi
Abstract: The traditional control theory and its application to basic and complex systems have reached an advanced level of maturity. This includes aerial, marine, and ground vehicles, as well as robotics, chemical, transportation, and electrical systems widely used in our daily lives. The emerging era of data-driven methods, Large Language Models (LLMs), and AI-based controllers does not indicate a weakness in well-established control theory. Instead, it aims to reduce dependence on models and uncertainties, address increasingly complex systems, and potentially achieve decision-making capabilities comparable to human-level performance. This revolution integrates knowledge from computer science, machine learning, biology, and classical control, producing promising algorithms that are yet to demonstrate widespread real-world applicability. Despite the maturity of control theory and the presence of various performance criteria, there is still a lack of standardised metrics for testing, evaluation, Verification and Validation ($V\&V$) of algorithms. This gap can lead to algorithms that, while optimal in certain aspects, may fall short of practical implementation, sparking debates within the literature. For a controller to succeed in real-world applications, it must satisfy three key categories of performance metrics: tracking quality, control effort (energy consumption), and robustness. This paper rather takes an applied perspective, proposing and consolidating standard performance criteria for testing and analysing control systems, intended for researchers and students. The proposed framework ensures the post-design applicability of a black-box algorithm, aligning with modern data analysis and $V\&V$ perspectives to prevent resource allocation to systems with limited impact or imprecise claims.

Title: Data-Driven Stabilization of Unknown Linear-Threshold Network Dynamics
Authors: Xuan Wang, Duy Duong-Tran, Jorge Cortés
Abstract: This paper studies the data-driven control of unknown linear-threshold network dynamics to stabilize the state to a reference value. We consider two types of controllers: (i) a state feedback controller with feed-forward reference input and (ii) an augmented feedback controller with error integration. The first controller features a simpler structure and is easier to design, while the second offers improved performance in the presence of system parameter changes and disturbances. Our design strategy employs state-input datasets to construct data-based representations of the closed-loop dynamics. Since these representations involve linear threshold functions, we rewrite them as switched linear systems, and formulate the design problem as that of finding a common controller for all the resulting modes. This gives rise to a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) whose solutions corresponds to the controller gain matrices. We analyze the computational complexity of solving the LMIs and propose a simplified, sufficient set of conditions that scales linearly with the system state. Simulations on two case studies involving regulation of firing rate dynamics in rodent brains and of arousal level dynamics in humans demonstrate the effectiveness of the controller designs.

Title: Learning Low-Dimensional Embeddings for Black-Box Optimization
Authors: Riccardo Busetto, Manas Mejari, Marco Forgione, Alberto Bemporad, Dario Piga
Abstract: When gradient-based methods are impractical, black-box optimization (BBO) provides a valuable alternative. However, BBO often struggles with high-dimensional problems and limited trial budgets. In this work, we propose a novel approach based on meta-learning to pre-compute a reduced-dimensional manifold where optimal points lie for a specific class of optimization problems. When optimizing a new problem instance sampled from the class, black-box optimization is carried out in the reduced-dimensional space, effectively reducing the effort required for finding near-optimal solutions.

Title: Reconstructing Brain Causal Dynamics for Subject and Task Fingerprints using fMRI Time-series Data
Authors: Dachuan Song, Li Shen, Duy Duong-Tran, Xuan Wang
Abstract: Purpose: Recently, there has been a revived interest in system neuroscience causation models, driven by their unique capability to unravel complex relationships in multi-scale brain networks. In this paper, we present a novel method that leverages causal dynamics to achieve effective fMRI-based subject and task fingerprinting. Methods: By applying an implicit-explicit discretization scheme, we develop a two-timescale linear state-space model. Through data-driven identification of its parameters, the model captures causal signatures, including directed interactions among brain regions from a spatial perspective, and disentangled fast and slow dynamic modes of brain activity from a temporal perspective. These causal signatures are then integrated with: (i) a modal decomposition and projection method for model-based subject identification, and (ii) a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for learning-based task classification. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of the brain reachability landscape as a novel visualization tool, which quantitatively characterizes the maximum possible activation levels of brain regions under various fMRI tasks. Results: We evaluate the proposed approach using the Human Connectome Project dataset and demonstrate its advantage over non-causality-based methods. The obtained causal signatures are visualized and demonstrate clear biological relevance with established understandings of brain function. Conclusion: We verified the feasibility and effectiveness of utilizing brain causal signatures for subject and task fingerprinting. Additionally, our work paves the way for further studies on causal fingerprints with potential applications in both healthy controls and neurodegenerative diseases.

Title: Path Integral Bottleneck: An Algorithm-Agnostic Framework of Computation and Control
Authors: Justin Ting, Jing Shuang Li
Abstract: Executing a control sequence requires computation. While this is a simple observation, developing a framework that relates a controller's required computation to its ability to successfully control a system (e.g. lower control cost) is challenging, especially when the controller appears on alternative compute platforms (e.g. biological neural networks). More specifically, we want a framework where, given an observed closed-loop trajectory, we can quantify the computation effort needed to produce that trajectory. To enable effective comparisons of closed-loop systems across alternative compute platforms, we present the Path Integral Bottleneck (PI-IB), a method to produce an analytical, algorithm-agnostic description of the compute-control relationship. With the PI-IB framework, we can plot tradeoffs between performance and computation effort for any given plant description and control cost function. Simulations of the cart-pole reveal fundamental control-compute tradeoffs, exposing regions where the task performance-per-compute is higher than others.

Title: AI-Driven Radio Propagation Prediction in Automated Warehouses using Variational Autoencoders
Authors: Rahul Gulia, Amlan Ganguly, Andres Kwasinski, Michael E. Kuhl, Ehsan Rashedi, Clark Hochgraf
Abstract: The next decade will usher in a profound transformation of wireless communication, driven by the ever-increasing demand for data-intensive applications and the rapid adoption of emerging technologies. To fully unlock the potential of 5G and beyond, substantial advancements are required in signal processing techniques, innovative network architectures, and efficient spectrum utilization strategies. These advancements facilitate seamless integration of emerging technologies, driving industrial digital transformation and connectivity. This paper introduces a novel Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based framework, Wireless Infrastructure for Smart Warehouses using VAE (WISVA), designed for accurate indoor radio propagation modeling in automated Industry 4.0 environments such as warehouses and factory floors operating within 5G wireless bands. The research delves into the meticulous creation of training data tensors, capturing complex electromagnetic (EM) wave behaviors influenced by diverse obstacles, and outlines the architecture and training methodology of the proposed VAE model. The model's robustness and adaptability are showcased through its ability to predict signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) heatmaps across various scenarios, including denoising tasks, validation datasets, extrapolation to unseen configurations, and previously unencountered warehouse layouts. Compelling reconstruction error heatmaps are presented, highlighting the superior accuracy of WISVA compared to traditional autoencoder models. The paper also analyzes the model's performance in handling complex smart warehouse environments, demonstrating its potential as a key enabler for optimizing wireless infrastructure in Industry 4.0.

Title: A Tutorial on MRI Reconstruction: From Modern Methods to Clinical Implications
Authors: Tolga Çukur, Salman U. H. Dar, Valiyeh Ansarian Nezhad, Yohan Jun, Tae Hyung Kim, Shohei Fujita, Berkin Bilgic
Abstract: MRI is an indispensable clinical tool, offering a rich variety of tissue contrasts to support broad diagnostic and research applications. Clinical exams routinely acquire multiple structural sequences that provide complementary information for differential diagnosis, while research protocols often incorporate advanced functional, diffusion, spectroscopic, and relaxometry sequences to capture multidimensional insights into tissue structure and composition. However, these capabilities come at the cost of prolonged scan times, which reduce patient throughput, increase susceptibility to motion artifacts, and may require trade-offs in image quality or diagnostic scope. Over the last two decades, advances in image reconstruction algorithms--alongside improvements in hardware and pulse sequence design--have made it possible to accelerate acquisitions while preserving diagnostic quality. Central to this progress is the ability to incorporate prior information to regularize the solutions to the reconstruction problem. In this tutorial, we overview the basics of MRI reconstruction and highlight state-of-the-art approaches, beginning with classical methods that rely on explicit hand-crafted priors, and then turning to deep learning methods that leverage a combination of learned and crafted priors to further push the performance envelope. We also explore the translational aspects and eventual clinical implications of these methods. We conclude by discussing future directions to address remaining challenges in MRI reconstruction. The tutorial is accompanied by a Python toolbox (this https URL) to demonstrate select methods discussed in the article.

Title: On the Gaussian Limit of the Output of IIR Filters
Authors: Yashaswini Murthy, Bassam Bamieh, R. Srikant
Abstract: We study the asymptotic distribution of the output of a stable Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system driven by a non-Gaussian stochastic input. Motivated by longstanding heuristics in the stochastic describing function method, we rigorously characterize when the output process becomes approximately Gaussian, even when the input is not. Using the Wasserstein-1 distance as a quantitative measure of non-Gaussianity, we derive upper bounds on the distance between the appropriately scaled output and a standard normal distribution. These bounds are obtained via Stein's method and depend explicitly on the system's impulse response and the dependence structure of the input process. We show that when the dominant pole of the system approaches the edge of stability and the input satisfies one of the following conditions: (i) independence, (ii) positive correlation with a real and positive dominant pole, or (iii) sufficient correlation decay, the output converges to a standard normal distribution at rate $O(1/\sqrt{t})$. We also present counterexamples where convergence fails, thereby motivating the stated assumptions. Our results provide a rigorous foundation for the widespread observation that outputs of low-pass LTI systems tend to be approximately Gaussian.

Title: Instantaneous Polarimetry with Zak-OTFS
Authors: Nishant Mehrotra, Sandesh Rao Mattu, Robert Calderbank
Abstract: Polarimetry, which is the ability to measure the scattering response of the environment across orthogonal polarizations, is fundamental to enhancing wireless communication and radar system performance. In this paper, we utilize the Zak-OTFS modulation to enable instantaneous polarimetry within a single transmission frame. We transmit a Zak-OTFS carrier waveform and a spread carrier waveform mutually unbiased to it simultaneously over orthogonal polarizations. The mutual unbiasedness of the two waveforms enables the receiver to estimate the full polarimetric response of the scattering environment from a single received frame. Unlike existing methods for instantaneous polarimetry with computational complexity quadratic in the time-bandwidth product, the proposed method enables instantaneous polarimetry at near-linear complexity in the time-bandwidth product. Via numerical simulations, we show ideal polarimetric target detection and parameter estimation results with the proposed method, with improvements in performance and computational complexity over comparable baselines.

Title: UltraUPConvNet: A UPerNet- and ConvNeXt-Based Multi-Task Network for Ultrasound Tissue Segmentation and Disease Prediction
Authors: Zhi Chen, Le Zhang
Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is widely used in clinical practice due to its cost-effectiveness, mobility, and safety. However, current AI research often treats disease prediction and tissue segmentation as two separate tasks and their model requires substantial computational overhead. In such a situation, we introduce UltraUPConvNet, a computationally efficient universal framework designed for both ultrasound image classification and segmentation. Trained on a large-scale dataset containing more than 9,700 annotations across seven different anatomical regions, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on certain datasets with lower computational overhead.

Title: Target Detection in Two-Channel Passive Radars with Inter-Receiver Collaboration
Authors: Nandan Sriranga, Haodong Yang, Venkata Gandikota, Pramod K. Varshney
Abstract: We address target detection in a single Delay-Doppler cell using spatially distributed two-channel passive radars. An unknown illuminator of opportunity (IO) is assumed to emit a waveform lying in a known low-dimensional subspace (e.g., OFDM). Each receiver transforms its reference and surveillance signals onto the IO subspace after noise-whitening, to obtain cross-correlation (CC) measurements. To save bandwidth, receivers collaboratively exchange and linearly combine the CC output, and only a subset transmits them to a fusion center (FC) over a multiple-access channel (MAC). Collaboration weights are designed using the moments of the FC measurement to enhance detection performance.

Title: Improving Virtual Contrast Enhancement using Longitudinal Data
Authors: Pierre Fayolle, Alexandre Bône, Noëlie Debs, Philippe Robert, Pascal Bourdon, Remy Guillevin, David Helbert
Abstract: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are widely used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to enhance lesion detection and characterisation, particularly in the field of neuro-oncology. Nevertheless, concerns regarding gadolinium retention and accumulation in brain and body tissues, most notably for diseases that require close monitoring and frequent GBCA injection, have led to the need for strategies to reduce dosage. In this study, a deep learning framework is proposed for the virtual contrast enhancement of full-dose post-contrast T1-weighted MRI images from corresponding low-dose acquisitions. The contribution of the presented model is its utilisation of longitudinal information, which is achieved by incorporating a prior full-dose MRI examination from the same patient. A comparative evaluation against a non-longitudinal single session model demonstrated that the longitudinal approach significantly improves image quality across multiple reconstruction metrics. Furthermore, experiments with varying simulated contrast doses confirmed the robustness of the proposed method. These results emphasize the potential of integrating prior imaging history into deep learning-based virtual contrast enhancement pipelines to reduce GBCA usage without compromising diagnostic utility, thus paving the way for safer, more sustainable longitudinal monitoring in clinical MRI practice.

Title: Learning Time-Graph Frequency Representation for Monaural Speech Enhancement
Authors: Tingting Wang, Tianrui Wang, Meng Ge, Qiquan Zhang, Xi Shao
Abstract: The Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) has recently demonstrated promising results in speech enhancement. However, existing GFT-based speech enhancement approaches often employ fixed graph topologies to build the graph Fourier basis, whose the representation lacks the adaptively and flexibility. In addition, they suffer from the numerical errors and instability introduced by matrix inversion in GFT based on both Singular Value Decomposition (GFT-SVD) and Eigen Vector Decomposition (GFT-EVD). Motivated by these limitations, this paper propose a simple yet effective learnable GFT-SVD framework for speech enhancement. Specifically, we leverage graph shift operators to construct a learnable graph topology and define a learnable graph Fourier basis by the singular value matrices using 1-D convolution (Conv-1D) neural layer. This eliminates the need for matrix inversion, thereby avoiding the associated numerical errors and stability problem.

Title: A Novel State-Centric Necessary Condition for Time-Optimal Control of Controllable Linear Systems Based on Augmented Switching Laws (Extended Version)
Authors: Yunan Wang, Chuxiong Hu, Yujie Lin, Zeyang Li, Shize Lin, Suqin He
Abstract: Most existing necessary conditions for optimal control based on adjoining methods require both state and costate information, yet the unobservability of costates for a given feasible trajectory impedes the determination of optimality in practice. This paper establishes a novel theoretical framework for time-optimal control of controllable linear systems with a single input, proposing the augmented switching law (ASL) that represents the input control and the feasibility in a compact form. Given a feasible trajectory, the perturbed trajectory under the constraints of ASL is guaranteed to be feasible, resulting in a novel state-centric necessary condition without dependence on costate information. A first-order necessary condition is proposed that the Jacobian matrix of the ASL is not of full row rank, which also results in a potential approach to optimizing a given feasible trajectory with the preservation of arc structures. The proposed necessary condition is applied to high-order chain-of-integrator systems with full box constraints, contributing to some theoretical results challenging to reason by costate-based conditions.

Title: NeRAF: 3D Scene Infused Neural Radiance and Acoustic Fields
Authors: Amandine Brunetto, Sascha Hornauer, Fabien Moutarde
Abstract: Sound plays a major role in human perception. Along with vision, it provides essential information for understanding our surroundings. Despite advances in neural implicit representations, learning acoustics that align with visual scenes remains a challenge. We propose NeRAF, a method that jointly learns acoustic and radiance fields. NeRAF synthesizes both novel views and spatialized room impulse responses (RIR) at new positions by conditioning the acoustic field on 3D scene geometric and appearance priors from the radiance field. The generated RIR can be applied to auralize any audio signal. Each modality can be rendered independently and at spatially distinct positions, offering greater versatility. We demonstrate that NeRAF generates high-quality audio on SoundSpaces and RAF datasets, achieving significant performance improvements over prior methods while being more data-efficient. Additionally, NeRAF enhances novel view synthesis of complex scenes trained with sparse data through cross-modal learning. NeRAF is designed as a Nerfstudio module, providing convenient access to realistic audio-visual generation.

Title: PAGURI: a user experience study of creative interaction with text-to-music models
Authors: Francesca Ronchini, Luca Comanducci, Gabriele Perego, Fabio Antonacci
Abstract: In recent years, text-to-music models have been the biggest breakthrough in automatic music generation. While they are unquestionably a showcase of technological progress, it is not clear yet how they can be realistically integrated into the artistic practice of musicians and music practitioners. This paper aims to address this question via Prompt Audio Generation User Research Investigation (PAGURI), a user experience study where we leverage recent text-to-music developments to study how musicians and practitioners interact with these systems, evaluating their satisfaction levels. We developed an online tool through which users can generate music samples and/or apply recently proposed personalization techniques based on fine-tuning to allow the text-to-music model to generate sounds closer to their needs and preferences. Using semi-structured interviews, we analyzed different aspects related to how participants interacted with the proposed tool to understand the current effectiveness and limitations of text-to-music models in enhancing users' creativity. Our research centers on user experiences to uncover insights that can guide the future development of TTM models and their role in AI-driven music creation. Additionally, they offered insightful perspectives on potential system improvements and their integration into their music practices. The results obtained through the study reveal the pros and cons of the use of TTMs for creative endeavors. Participants recognized the system's creative potential and appreciated the usefulness of its personalization features. However, they also identified several challenges that must be addressed before TTMs are ready for real-world music creation, particularly issues of prompt ambiguity, limited controllability, and integration into existing workflows.

Title: Kapitza-Inspired Stabilization of Non-Foster Circuits via Time Modulations
Authors: Antonio Alex-Amor, Grigorii Ptitcyn, Nader Engheta
Abstract: With his formal analysis in 1951, the physicist Pyotr Kapitza demonstrated that an inverted pendulum with an externally vibrating base can be stable in its upper position, thus overcoming the force of gravity. Kapitza's work is an example that an originally unstable system can become stable after a minor perturbation of its properties or initial conditions is applied. Inspired by his ideas, we show how non-Foster circuits can be stabilized with the application of external \textit{electrical vibration}, i.e., time modulations. Non-Foster circuits are highly appreciated in the engineering community since their bandwidth characteristics are not limited by passive-circuits bounds. Unfortunately, non-Foster circuits are usually unstable and they must be stabilized prior to operation. Here, we focus on the study of non-Foster $L(t)C$ circuits with time-varying inductors and time-invariant negative capacitors. We find an intrinsic connection between Kapitza's inverted pendulum and non-Foster $L(t)C$ resonators. Moreover, we show how positive time-varying modulations of $L(t)>0$ can overcome and stabilize non-Foster negative capacitances $C<0$. These findings open up an alternative manner of stabilizing electric circuits with the use of time modulations, and lay the groundwork for application of, what we coin \textit{Vibrational Electromagnetics}, in more complex media.

Title: Continuous Wrist Control on the Hannes Prosthesis: a Vision-based Shared Autonomy Framework
Authors: Federico Vasile, Elisa Maiettini, Giulia Pasquale, Nicolò Boccardo, Lorenzo Natale
Abstract: Most control techniques for prosthetic grasping focus on dexterous fingers control, but overlook the wrist motion. This forces the user to perform compensatory movements with the elbow, shoulder and hip to adapt the wrist for grasping. We propose a computer vision-based system that leverages the collaboration between the user and an automatic system in a shared autonomy framework, to perform continuous control of the wrist degrees of freedom in a prosthetic arm, promoting a more natural approach-to-grasp motion. Our pipeline allows to seamlessly control the prosthetic wrist to follow the target object and finally orient it for grasping according to the user intent. We assess the effectiveness of each system component through quantitative analysis and finally deploy our method on the Hannes prosthetic arm. Code and videos: this https URL.

Title: Audio-Enhanced Vision-Language Modeling with Latent Space Broadening for High Quality Data Expansion
Authors: Yu Sun, Yin Li, Ruixiao Sun, Chunhui Liu, Fangming Zhou, Ze Jin, Linjie Wang, Xiang Shen, Zhuolin Hao, Hongyu Xiong
Abstract: Transformer-based multimodal models are widely used in industrial-scale recommendation, search, and advertising systems for content understanding and relevance ranking. Enhancing labeled training data quality and cross-modal fusion significantly improves model performance, influencing key metrics such as quality view rates and ad revenue. High-quality annotations are crucial for advancing content modeling, yet traditional statistical-based active learning (AL) methods face limitations: they struggle to detect overconfident misclassifications and are less effective in distinguishing semantically similar items in deep neural networks. Additionally, audio information plays an increasing role, especially in short-video platforms, yet most pre-trained multimodal architectures primarily focus on text and images. While training from scratch across all three modalities is possible, it sacrifices the benefits of leveraging existing pre-trained visual-language (VL) and audio models. To address these challenges, we propose kNN-based Latent Space Broadening (LSB) to enhance AL efficiency and Vision-Language Modeling with Audio Enhancement (VLMAE), a mid-fusion approach integrating audio into VL models. This system deployed in production systems, leading to significant business gains.

Title: Robust Capacity Expansion Modelling for Renewable Energy Systems
Authors: Sebastian Kebrich, Felix Engelhardt, David Franzmann, Christina Büsing, Jochen Linßen, Heidi Heinrichs
Abstract: Future greenhouse gas neutral energy systems will be dominated by renewable energy technologies whose energy output and utilisation is subject to uncertain weather conditions. This work proposes an algorithm for capacity expansion planning if only uncertain data is available for a year's operative parameters. When faced with multiple possible operating years, the quality of a solution derived on a single operating year's data is evaluated for all years, and the optimisation problem is iteratively modified whenever supply gaps are detected. These modifications lead to solutions with sufficient back-up capacity to overcome periods of cold dark lulls, and sufficient total annual energy supply across all years. A computational study on an energy system model of Germany for 40 different operating years shows that the iterative algorithm finds solutions that guarantee security of supply for all considered years increasing the total annual cost by 1.6-2.9% compared to a lower bound. Results also underline the importance of assessing the feasibility of energy system models using atypical time-series, combining dark lull and cold period effects.

Title: AdGT: Decentralized Gradient Tracking with Tuning-free Per-Agent Stepsize
Authors: Diyako Ghaderyan, Stefan Werner
Abstract: In decentralized optimization, the choice of stepsize plays a critical role in algorithm performance. A common approach is to use a shared stepsize across all agents to ensure convergence. However, selecting an optimal stepsize often requires careful tuning, which can be time-consuming and may lead to slow convergence, especially when there is significant variation in the smoothness (L-smoothness) of local objective functions across agents. Individually tuning stepsizes per agent is also impractical, particularly in large-scale networks. To address these limitations, we propose AdGT, an adaptive gradient tracking method that enables each agent to adjust its stepsize based on the smoothness of its local objective. We prove that AdGT achieves linear convergence to the global optimal solution. Through numerical experiments, we compare AdGT with fixed-stepsize gradient tracking methods and demonstrate its superior performance. Additionally, we compare AdGT with adaptive gradient descent (AdGD) in a centralized setting and observe that fully adaptive stepsizes offer greater benefits in decentralized networks than in centralized ones.

Title: Time-o1: Time-Series Forecasting Needs Transformed Label Alignment
Authors: Hao Wang, Licheng Pan, Zhichao Chen, Xu Chen, Qingyang Dai, Lei Wang, Haoxuan Li, Zhouchen Lin
Abstract: Training time-series forecast models presents unique challenges in designing effective learning objectives. Existing methods predominantly utilize the temporal mean squared error, which faces two critical challenges: (1) label autocorrelation, which leads to bias from the label sequence likelihood; (2) excessive amount of tasks, which increases with the forecast horizon and complicates optimization. To address these challenges, we propose Time-o1, a transformation-augmented learning objective tailored for time-series forecasting. The central idea is to transform the label sequence into decorrelated components with discriminated significance. Models are then trained to align the most significant components, thereby effectively mitigating label autocorrelation and reducing task amount. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Time-o1 achieves state-of-the-art performance and is compatible with various forecast models. Code is available at this https URL.

Title: MambAttention: Mamba with Multi-Head Attention for Generalizable Single-Channel Speech Enhancement
Authors: Nikolai Lund Kühne, Jesper Jensen, Jan Østergaard, Zheng-Hua Tan
Abstract: With the advent of new sequence models like Mamba and xLSTM, several studies have shown that these models match or outperform state-of-the-art models in single-channel speech enhancement, automatic speech recognition, and self-supervised audio representation learning. However, prior research has demonstrated that sequence models like LSTM and Mamba tend to overfit to the training set. To address this issue, previous works have shown that adding self-attention to LSTMs substantially improves generalization performance for single-channel speech enhancement. Nevertheless, neither the concept of hybrid Mamba and time-frequency attention models nor their generalization performance have been explored for speech enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid architecture, MambAttention, which combines Mamba and shared time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalizable single-channel speech enhancement. To train our model, we introduce VoiceBank+Demand Extended (VB-DemandEx), a dataset inspired by VoiceBank+Demand but with more challenging noise types and lower signal-to-noise ratios. Trained on VB-DemandEx, our proposed MambAttention model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art LSTM-, xLSTM-, Mamba-, and Conformer-based systems of similar complexity across all reported metrics on two out-of-domain datasets: DNS 2020 and EARS-WHAM_v2, while matching their performance on the in-domain dataset VB-DemandEx. Ablation studies highlight the role of weight sharing between the time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalization performance. Finally, we explore integrating the shared time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules with LSTM and xLSTM, which yields a notable performance improvement on the out-of-domain datasets. However, our MambAttention model remains superior on both out-of-domain datasets across all reported evaluation metrics.

Title: Phase Noise Tolerance for Low-Pilot-Overhead OFDM Terahertz Links Beyond 64-QAM
Authors: Bowen Liu, Takasumi Tanabe
Abstract: THz wireless communications have garnered significant attention due to their unprecedented data rates enabled by the abundant untapped spectrum. However, advanced modulation formats beyond 64-QAM remain largely unexplored, as phase errors introduced during up/down-conversion severely limit system performance. Particularly, OFDM transmission is highly susceptible to aggravated ICI induced by phase noise, undermining the orthogonality of subcarriers. While PLLs and pilot-assisted compensation can mitigate phase errors, excessive pilot overhead compromises spectral efficiency and energy consumption, and white phase noise remains unrecoverable. Therefore, quantifying phase noise tolerance is essential for practical physical layer protocols. Here, we reveal the impact of phase noise in a 64-QAM, 2048-subcarrier OFDM THz transmission system. 3{\sigma}-error estimation is proposed to quantify phase noise tolerance, indicating an intuitive EVM threshold of approximately 5%. This threshold further delineates the trade-offs among phase noise levels, SNR requirements, and pilot overhead. Moreover, by benchmarking representative oscillators with distinct phase noise spectra, microring resonators (MRRs) are identified as indispensable enablers for low-pilot-overhead OFDM THz links operating beyond 64-QAM.

Title: SpeechWeave: Diverse Multilingual Synthetic Text & Audio Data Generation Pipeline for Training Text to Speech Models
Authors: Karan Dua, Puneet Mittal, Ranjeet Gupta, Hitesh Laxmichand Patel
Abstract: High-quality Text-to-Speech (TTS) model training requires extensive and diverse text and speech data. It is challenging to procure such data from real sources due to issues of domain specificity, licensing, and scalability. Large language models (LLMs) can certainly generate textual data, but they create repetitive text with insufficient variation in the prompt during the generation process. Another important aspect in TTS training data is text normalization. Tools for normalization might occasionally introduce anomalies or overlook valuable patterns, and thus impact data quality. Furthermore, it is also impractical to rely on voice artists for large scale speech recording in commercial TTS systems with standardized voices. To address these challenges, we propose SpeechWeave, a synthetic speech data generation pipeline that is capable of automating the generation of multilingual, domain-specific datasets for training TTS models. Our experiments reveal that our pipeline generates data that is 10-48% more diverse than the baseline across various linguistic and phonetic metrics, along with speaker-standardized speech audio while generating approximately 97% correctly normalized text. Our approach enables scalable, high-quality data generation for TTS training, improving diversity, normalization, and voice consistency in the generated datasets.

Title: Quantifying Phase Noise Tolerance for Single-Carrier M-QAM Terahertz Wireless Communications with Advantages of Photonic Approaches
Authors: Bowen Liu, Takasumi Tanabe
Abstract: Terahertz wireless communications offer abundant untapped spectrum and are regarded as a promising playground for next-generation high-throughput links. Yet oscillator phase noise becomes the dominant impairment at such high frequencies, severely limiting the reliability of high-order QAM transmission. While photonic approaches, such as microcombs, are known to realize ultralow phase noise, the quantitative level of suppression required to sustain reliable high-order QAM transmission has not been clarified. Here, phase noise is reconstructed from measured spectra and embedded into a single-carrier link model to evaluate its impact. Distinct distortion mechanisms are identified, with slow common phase error and instantaneous phase jitter, where the latter remains as the residual impairment after carrier phase recovery. We further adopt the 3{\sigma} error criterion, which maps residual distortions onto the constellation, providing a clear and practical indicator of system robustness. The results indicate that modest improvements in oscillator stability translate into significant BER gains without proportional power increase. These findings provide intuitive tolerance of phase noise in M-QAM systems and emphasize the importance of integrating low-noise photonic oscillators such as microcombs.

Title: World Model for AI Autonomous Navigation in Mechanical Thrombectomy
Authors: Harry Robertshaw, Han-Ru Wu, Alejandro Granados, Thomas C Booth
Abstract: Autonomous navigation for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) remains a critical challenge due to the complexity of vascular anatomy and the need for precise, real-time decision-making. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches have demonstrated potential in automating endovascular navigation, but current methods often struggle with generalization across multiple patient vasculatures and long-horizon tasks. We propose a world model for autonomous endovascular navigation using TD-MPC2, a model-based RL algorithm. We trained a single RL agent across multiple endovascular navigation tasks in ten real patient vasculatures, comparing performance against the state-of-the-art Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) method. Results indicate that TD-MPC2 significantly outperforms SAC in multi-task learning, achieving a 65% mean success rate compared to SAC's 37%, with notable improvements in path ratio. TD-MPC2 exhibited increased procedure times, suggesting a trade-off between success rate and execution speed. These findings highlight the potential of world models for improving autonomous endovascular navigation and lay the foundation for future research in generalizable AI-driven robotic interventions.
