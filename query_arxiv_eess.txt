Title: ES-HPC-MPC: Exponentially Stable Hybrid Perception Constrained MPC for Quadrotor with Suspended Payloads
Authors: Luis F. Recalde, Mrunal Sarvaiya, Giuseppe Loianno, Guanrui Li
Abstract: Aerial transportation using quadrotors with cable-suspended payloads holds great potential for applications in disaster response, logistics, and infrastructure maintenance. However, their hybrid and underactuated dynamics pose significant control and perception challenges. Traditional approaches often assume a taut cable condition, limiting their effectiveness in real-world applications where slack-to-taut transitions occur due to disturbances. We introduce ES-HPC-MPC, a model predictive control framework that enforces exponential stability and perception-constrained control under hybrid dynamics. Our method leverages Exponentially Stabilizing Control Lyapunov Functions (ES-CLFs) to enforce stability during the tasks and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to maintain the payload within the onboard camera's field of view (FoV). We validate our method through both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating stable trajectory tracking and reliable payload perception. We validate that our method maintains stability and satisfies perception constraints while tracking dynamically infeasible trajectories and when the system is subjected to hybrid mode transitions caused by unexpected disturbances.

Title: Artificial Intelligence Augmented Medical Imaging Reconstruction in Radiation Therapy
Authors: Di Xu
Abstract: Efficiently acquired and precisely reconstructed imaging are crucial to the success of modern radiation therapy (RT). Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are two common modalities for providing RT treatment planning and delivery guidance/monitoring. In recent decades, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful and widely adopted technique across various fields, valued for its efficiency and convenience enabled by implicit function definition and data-driven feature representation learning. Here, we present a series of AI-driven medical imaging reconstruction frameworks for enhanced radiotherapy, designed to improve CT image reconstruction quality and speed, refine dual-energy CT (DECT) multi-material decomposition (MMD), and significantly accelerate 4D MRI acquisition.

Title: Data-Importance-Aware Power Allocation for Adaptive Real-Time Communication in Computer Vision Applications
Authors: Chunmei Xu, Yi Ma, Rahim Tafazolli, Jiangzhou Wang
Abstract: Life-transformative applications such as immersive extended reality are revolutionizing wireless communications and computer vision (CV). This paper presents a novel framework for importance-aware adaptive data transmissions, designed specifically for real-time CV applications where task-specific fidelity is critical. A novel importance-weighted mean square error (IMSE) metric is introduced as a task-oriented measure of reconstruction quality, considering sub-pixel-level importance (SP-I) and semantic segment-level importance (SS-I) models. To minimize IMSE under total power constraints, data-importance-aware waterfilling approaches are proposed to optimally allocate transmission power according to data importance and channel conditions, prioritizing sub-streams with high importance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approaches significantly outperform margin-adaptive waterfilling and equal power allocation strategies. The data partitioning that combines both SP-I and SS-I models is shown to achieve the most significant improvements, with normalized IMSE gains exceeding $7\,$dB and $10\,$dB over the baselines at high SNRs ($>10\,$dB). These substantial gains highlight the potential of the proposed framework to enhance data efficiency and robustness in real-time CV applications, especially in bandwidth-limited and resource-constrained environments.

Title: Exploring the Effects of Load Altering Attacks on Load Frequency Control through Python and RTDS
Authors: Michał Forystek, Andrew D. Syrmakesis, Alkistis Kontou, Panos Kotsampopoulos, Nikos D. Hatziargyriou, Charalambos Konstantinou
Abstract: The modern power grid increasingly depends on advanced information and communication technology (ICT) systems to enhance performance and reliability through real-time monitoring, intelligent control, and bidirectional communication. However, ICT integration also exposes the grid to cyber-threats. Load altering attacks (LAAs), which use botnets of high-wattage devices to manipulate load profiles, are a notable threat to grid stability. While previous research has examined LAAs, their specific impact on load frequency control (LFC), critical for maintaining nominal frequency during load fluctuations, still needs to be explored. Even minor frequency deviations can jeopardize grid operations. This study bridges the gap by analyzing LAA effects on LFC through simulations of static and dynamic scenarios using Python and RTDS. The results highlight LAA impacts on frequency stability and present an eigenvalue-based stability assessment for dynamic LAAs (DLAAs), identifying key parameters influencing grid resilience.

Title: Beyond Global Metrics: A Fairness Analysis for Interpretable Voice Disorder Detection Systems
Authors: Mariel Estevez, Cyntia Bonomi, Dayana Ribas, Alfonso Ortega, Luciana Ferrer
Abstract: We conducted a comprehensive analysis of an Automatic Voice Disorders Detection (AVDD) system using existing voice disorder datasets with available demographic metadata. The study involved analysing system performance across various demographic groups, particularly focusing on gender and age-based cohorts. Performance evaluation was based on multiple metrics, including normalised costs and cross-entropy. We employed calibration techniques trained separately on predefined demographic groups to address group-dependent miscalibration. Analysis revealed significant performance disparities across groups despite strong global metrics. The system showed systematic biases, misclassifying healthy speakers over 55 as having a voice disorder and speakers with disorders aged 14-30 as healthy. Group-specific calibration improved posterior probability quality, reducing overconfidence. For young disordered speakers, low severity scores were identified as contributing to poor system performance. For older speakers, age-related voice characteristics and potential limitations in the pretrained Hubert model used as feature extractor likely affected results. The study demonstrates that global performance metrics are insufficient for evaluating AVDD system performance. Group-specific analysis may unmask problems in system performance which are hidden within global metrics. Further, group-dependent calibration strategies help mitigate biases, resulting in a more reliable indication of system confidence. These findings emphasize the need for demographic-specific evaluation and calibration in voice disorder detection systems, while providing a methodological framework applicable to broader biomedical classification tasks where demographic metadata is available.

Title: Sample Efficient Algorithms for Linear System Identification under Noisy Observations
Authors: Yuyang Zhang, Xinhe Zhang, Jia Liu, Na Li
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on learning linear dynamical systems under noisy observations. In this setting, existing algorithms either yield biased parameter estimates, or suffer from large sample complexities. To address these issues, we adapt the instrumental variable method and the bias compensation method, originally proposed for error-in-variables models, to our setting and provide refined non-asymptotic analysis. Under mild conditions, our algorithms achieve superior sample complexities that match the best-known sample complexity for learning a fully observable system without observation noise.

Title: SIFT-50M: A Large-Scale Multilingual Dataset for Speech Instruction Fine-Tuning
Authors: Prabhat Pandey, Rupak Vignesh Swaminathan, K V Vijay Girish, Arunasish Sen, Jian Xie, Grant P. Strimel, Andreas Schwarz
Abstract: We introduce SIFT (Speech Instruction Fine-Tuning), a 50M-example dataset designed for instruction fine-tuning and pre-training of speech-text large language models (LLMs). SIFT-50M is built from publicly available speech corpora, which collectively contain 14K hours of speech, and leverages LLMs along with off-the-shelf expert models. The dataset spans five languages, encompassing a diverse range of speech understanding as well as controllable speech generation instructions. Using SIFT-50M, we train SIFT-LLM, which outperforms existing speech-text LLMs on instruction-following benchmarks while achieving competitive performance on foundational speech tasks. To support further research, we also introduce EvalSIFT, a benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate the instruction-following capabilities of speech-text LLMs.

Title: Multi-Modal Brain Tumor Segmentation via 3D Multi-Scale Self-attention and Cross-attention
Authors: Yonghao Huang, Leiting Chen, Chuan Zhou
Abstract: Due to the success of CNN-based and Transformer-based models in various computer vision tasks, recent works study the applicability of CNN-Transformer hybrid architecture models in 3D multi-modality medical segmentation tasks. Introducing Transformer brings long-range dependent information modeling ability in 3D medical images to hybrid models via the self-attention mechanism. However, these models usually employ fixed receptive fields of 3D volumetric features within each self-attention layer, ignoring the multi-scale volumetric lesion features. To address this issue, we propose a CNN-Transformer hybrid 3D medical image segmentation model, named TMA-TransBTS, based on an encoder-decoder structure. TMA-TransBTS realizes simultaneous extraction of multi-scale 3D features and modeling of long-distance dependencies by multi-scale division and aggregation of 3D tokens in a self-attention layer. Furthermore, TMA-TransBTS proposes a 3D multi-scale cross-attention module to establish a link between the encoder and the decoder for extracting rich volume representations by exploiting the mutual attention mechanism of cross-attention and multi-scale aggregation of 3D tokens. Extensive experimental results on three public 3D medical segmentation datasets show that TMA-TransBTS achieves higher averaged segmentation results than previous state-of-the-art CNN-based 3D methods and CNN-Transform hybrid 3D methods for the segmentation of 3D multi-modality brain tumors.

Title: Leveraging Large Self-Supervised Time-Series Models for Transferable Diagnosis in Cross-Aircraft Type Bleed Air System
Authors: Yilin Wang, Peixuan Lei, Xuyang Wang, Liangliang Jiang, Liming Xuan, Wei Cheng, Honghua Zhao, Yuanxiang Li
Abstract: Bleed Air System (BAS) is critical for maintaining flight safety and operational efficiency, supporting functions such as cabin pressurization, air conditioning, and engine anti-icing. However, BAS malfunctions, including overpressure, low pressure, and overheating, pose significant risks such as cabin depressurization, equipment failure, or engine damage. Current diagnostic approaches face notable limitations when applied across different aircraft types, particularly for newer models that lack sufficient operational data. To address these challenges, this paper presents a self-supervised learning-based foundation model that enables the transfer of diagnostic knowledge from mature aircraft (e.g., A320, A330) to newer ones (e.g., C919). Leveraging self-supervised pretraining, the model learns universal feature representations from flight signals without requiring labeled data, making it effective in data-scarce scenarios. This model enhances both anomaly detection and baseline signal prediction, thereby improving system reliability. The paper introduces a cross-model dataset, a self-supervised learning framework for BAS diagnostics, and a novel Joint Baseline and Anomaly Detection Loss Function tailored to real-world flight data. These innovations facilitate efficient transfer of diagnostic knowledge across aircraft types, ensuring robust support for early operational stages of new models. Additionally, the paper explores the relationship between model capacity and transferability, providing a foundation for future research on large-scale flight signal models.

Title: Ray-Based Characterization of the AMPLE Model from 0.85 to 5 GHz
Authors: Lingyou Zhou, Xin Dong, Kehai Qiu, Gang Yu, Jie Zhang, Jiliang Zhang
Abstract: In this paper, we characterize the adaptive multiple path loss exponent (AMPLE) radio propagation model under urban macrocell (UMa) and urban microcell (UMi) scenarios from 0.85-5 GHz using Ranplan Professional. We first enhance the original AMPLE model by introducing an additional frequency coefficient to support path loss prediction across multiple carrier frequencies. By using measurement-validated Ranplan Professional simulator, we simulate four cities and validate the simulations for further path loss model characterization. Specifically, we extract the close-in (CI) model parameters from the simulations and compare them with parameters extracted from measurements in other works. Under the ray-based model characterization, we compare the AMPLE model with the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) path loss model, the CI model, the alpha-beta-gamma (ABG) model, and those with simulation calibrations. In addition to standard performance metrics, we introduce the prediction-measurement difference error (PMDE) to assess overall prediction alignment with measurement, and mean simulation time per data point to evaluate model complexity. The results show that the AMPLE model outperforms existing models while maintaining similar model complexity.

Title: HARQ-based Quantized Average Consensus over Unreliable Directed Network Topologies
Authors: Neofytos Charalampous, Evagoras Makridis, Apostolos I. Rikos, Themistoklis Charalambous
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm (herein called HARQ-QAC) that enables nodes to calculate the average of their initial states by exchanging quantized messages over a directed communication network. In our setting, we assume that our communication network consists of unreliable communication links (i.e., links suffering from packet drops). For countering link unreliability our algorithm leverages narrowband error-free feedback channels for acknowledging whether a packet transmission between nodes was successful. Additionally, we show that the feedback channels play a crucial role in enabling our algorithm to exhibit finite-time convergence. We analyze our algorithm and demonstrate its operation via an example, where we illustrate its operational advantages. Finally, simulations corroborate that our proposed algorithm converges to the average of the initial quantized values in a finite number of steps, despite the packet losses. This is the first quantized consensus algorithm in the literature that can handle packet losses and converge to the average. Additionally, the use of the retransmission mechanism allows for accelerating the convergence.

Title: Hybrid Beamforming for RIS-Assisted Multiuser Fluid Antenna Systems
Authors: Jiangong Chen, Yue Xiao, Zhendong Peng, Jing Zhu, Xia Lei, Christos Masouros, Kai-Kit Wong
Abstract: Recent advances in reconfigurable antennas have led to the new concept of the fluid antenna system (FAS) for shape and position flexibility, as another degree of freedom for wireless communication enhancement. This paper explores the integration of a transmit FAS array for hybrid beamforming (HBF) into a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted communication architecture for multiuser communications in the downlink, corresponding to the downlink RIS-assisted multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) FAS model (Tx RIS-assisted-MISO-FAS). By considering Rician channel fading, we formulate a sum-rate maximization optimization problem to alternately optimize the HBF matrix, the RIS phase-shift matrix, and the FAS position. Due to the strong coupling of multiple optimization variables, the multi-fractional summation in the sum-rate expression, the modulus-1 limitation of analog phase shifters and RIS, and the antenna position variables appearing in the exponent, this problem is highly non-convex, which is addressed through the block coordinate descent (BCD) framework in conjunction with semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and majorization-minimization (MM) methods. To reduce the computational complexity, we then propose a low-complexity grating-lobe (GL)-based telescopic-FAS (TFA) with multiple delicately deployed RISs under the sub-connected HBF architecture and the line-of-sight (LoS)-dominant channel condition, to allow closed-form solutions for the HBF and TFA position. Our simulation results illustrate that the former optimization scheme significantly enhances the achievable rate of the proposed system, while the GL-based TFA scheme also provides a considerable gain over conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems, requiring statistical channel state information (CSI) only and with low computational complexity.

Title: seg2med: a segmentation-based medical image generation framework using denoising diffusion probabilistic models
Authors: Zeyu Yang, Zhilin Chen, Yipeng Sun, Anika Strittmatter, Anish Raj, Ahmad Allababidi, Johann S. Rink, Frank G. Zöllner
Abstract: In this study, we present seg2med, an advanced medical image synthesis framework that uses Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) to generate high-quality synthetic medical images conditioned on anatomical masks from TotalSegmentator. The framework synthesizes CT and MR images from segmentation masks derived from real patient data and XCAT digital phantoms, achieving a Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of 0.94 +/- 0.02 for CT and 0.89 +/- 0.04 for MR images compared to ground-truth images of real patients. It also achieves a Feature Similarity Index Measure (FSIM) of 0.78 +/- 0.04 for CT images from XCAT. The generative quality is further supported by a Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) of 3.62 for CT image generation. Additionally, seg2med can generate paired CT and MR images with consistent anatomical structures and convert images between CT and MR modalities, achieving SSIM values of 0.91 +/- 0.03 for MR-to-CT and 0.77 +/- 0.04 for CT-to-MR conversion. Despite the limitations of incomplete anatomical details in segmentation masks, the framework shows strong performance in cross-modality synthesis and multimodal imaging. seg2med also demonstrates high anatomical fidelity in CT synthesis, achieving a mean Dice coefficient greater than 0.90 for 11 abdominal organs and greater than 0.80 for 34 organs out of 59 in 58 test cases. The highest Dice of 0.96 +/- 0.01 was recorded for the right scapula. Leveraging the TotalSegmentator toolkit, seg2med enables segmentation mask generation across diverse datasets, supporting applications in clinical imaging, data augmentation, multimodal synthesis, and diagnostic algorithm development.

Title: Complexity-Scalable Near-Optimal Transceiver Design for Massive MIMO-BICM Systems
Authors: Jie Yang, Wanchen Hu, Yi Jiang, Shuangyang Li, Xin Wang, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng, Giuseppe Caire
Abstract: Future wireless networks are envisioned to employ multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmissions with large array sizes, and therefore, the adoption of complexity-scalable transceiver becomes important. In this paper, we propose a novel complexity-scalable transceiver design for MIMO systems exploiting bit-interleaved coded modulation (termed MIMO-BICM systems). The proposed scheme leverages the channel bidiagonalization decomposition (CBD), based on which an optimization framework for the precoder and post-processor is developed for maximizing the mutual information (MI) with finite-alphabet inputs. Particularly, we unveil that the desired precoder and post-processor behave distinctively with respect to the operating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), where the equivalent channel condition number (ECCN) serves as an effective indicator for the overall achievable rate performance. Specifically, at low SNRs, diagonal transmission with a large ECCN is advantageous, while at high SNRs, uniform subchannel gains with a small ECCN are preferred. This allows us to further propose a low-complexity generalized parallel CBD design (GP-CBD) based on Givens rotation according to a well-approximated closed-form performance metric on the achievable rates that takes into account the insights from the ECCN. Numerical results validate the superior performance of the proposed scheme in terms of achievable rate and bit error rate (BER), compared to state-of-the-art designs across various modulation and coding schemes (MCSs).

Title: Asymptotic stabilization under homomorphic encryption: A re-encryption free method
Authors: Shuai Feng, Qian Ma, Junsoo Kim, Shengyuan Xu
Abstract: In this paper, we propose methods to encrypted a pre-given dynamic controller with homomorphic encryption, without re-encrypting the control inputs. We first present a preliminary result showing that the coefficients in a pre-given dynamic controller can be scaled up into integers by the zooming-in factor in dynamic quantization, without utilizing re-encryption. However, a sufficiently small zooming-in factor may not always exist because it requires that the convergence speed of the pre-given closed-loop system should be sufficiently fast. Then, as the main result, we design a new controller approximating the pre-given dynamic controller, in which the zooming-in factor is decoupled from the convergence rate of the pre-given closed-loop system. Therefore, there always exist a (sufficiently small) zooming-in factor of dynamic quantization scaling up all the controller's coefficients to integers, and a finite modulus preventing overflow in cryptosystems. The process is asymptotically stable and the quantizer is not saturated.

Title: Channel Estimation for mmWave Pinching-Antenna Systems
Authors: Gui Zhou, Vasilis Papanikolaou, Zhiguo Ding, Robert Schober
Abstract: The full potential of pinching-antenna systems (PAS) can be unblocked if pinching antennas can be accurately activated at positions tailored for the serving users', which means that acquiring accurate channel state information (CSI) at arbitrary positions along the waveguide is essential for the precise placement of antennas. In this work, we propose an innovative channel estimation scheme for millimeter-wave (mmWave) PAS. The proposed approach requires activating only a small number of pinching antennas, thereby limiting antenna switching and pilot overhead. Specifically, a base station (BS) equipped with a waveguide selectively activates subarrays located near and far from the feed point, each comprising a small number of pinching antennas. This configuration effectively emulates a large-aperture array, enabling high-accuracy estimation of multipath propagation parameters, including angles, delays, and path gains. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accurate CSI estimation and data rates while effectively reducing hardware switching and pilot overhead.

Title: Macroscale Molecular Communication in IoT-based Pipeline Inspection and Monitoring Applications: Preliminary Experiment and Mathematical Model
Authors: Muneer M. Al-Zubi, Mohamed-Slim Alouini
Abstract: Today, pipeline networks serve as critical infrastructure for transporting materials such as water, gas, and oil. Modern technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), sensor nodes, and inspection robots enable efficient pipeline monitoring and inspection. They can help detect and monitor various conditions and defects in pipelines such as cracks, corrosion, leakage, pressure, flow, and temperature. Since most pipelines are buried underground, wireless communication links suffer from significant attenuation and noise due to harsh environmental conditions. In such systems, communication links are required between the sensor nodes as well as between the external control/monitoring unit or sensor node and the inspection robot inside the pipeline. In this paper, we propose a macroscale molecular communication (MC) system in the IoT-based pipeline inspection and monitoring networks to address this challenge. We develop a mathematical model and implement a preliminary experimental testbed to validate the system and demonstrate its feasibility by transmitting and reconstructing binary sequences using volatile organic compound (VOC) as an information signal. We examined the impact of various system parameters including airflow carrier velocity, released VOC velocity, emission duration, and bit duration. Results indicate that these parameters significantly influence the received molecular signal, emphasizing the need for optimal configuration. This work serves as a preliminary step for further research on the application of MC in IoT-based pipeline inspection and monitoring systems.

Title: Computationally Efficient Signal Detection with Unknown Bandwidths
Authors: Ali Rasteh, Sundeep Rangan
Abstract: Signal detection in environments with unknown signal bandwidth and time intervals is a basic problem in adversarial and spectrum-sharing scenarios. This paper addresses the problem of detecting signals occupying unknown degrees of freedom from non-coherent power measurements where the signal is constrained to an interval in one dimension or hypercube in multiple dimensions. A Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) is derived, resulting in a straightforward metric involving normalized average signal energy on each candidate signal set. We present bounds on false alarm and missed detection probabilities, demonstrating their dependence on signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and signal set sizes. To overcome the inherent computational complexity of exhaustive searches, we propose a computationally efficient binary search method, reducing the complexity from O(N2) to O(N) for one-dimensional cases. Simulations indicate that the method maintains performance near exhaustive searches and achieves asymptotic consistency, with interval-of-overlap converging to one under constant SNR as measurement size increases. The simulation studies also demonstrate superior performance and reduced complexity compared to contemporary neural network-based approaches, specifically outperforming custom-trained U-Net models in spectrum detection tasks.

Title: A New OTFS-Based Index Modulation System for 6G and Beyond: OTFS-Based Code Index Modulation
Authors: Burak Ahmet Ozden, Erdogan Aydin, Emir Aslandogan, Haci Ilhan, Ertugrul Basar, Miaowen Wen, Marco Di Renzo
Abstract: This paper proposes the orthogonal time frequency space-based code index modulation (OTFS-CIM) scheme, a novel wireless communication system that combines OTFS modulation, which enhances error performance in high-mobility Rayleigh channels, with CIM technique, which improves spectral and energy efficiency, within a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) architecture. The proposed system is evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations for various system parameters. Results show that increasing the modulation order degrades performance, while more receive antennas enhance it. Comparative analyses of error performance, throughput, spectral efficiency, and energy saving demonstrate that OTFS-CIM outperforms traditional OTFS and OTFS-based spatial modulation (OTFS-SM) systems. Also, the proposed OTFS-CIM system outperforms benchmark systems in many performance metrics under high-mobility scenarios, making it a strong candidate for sixth generation (6G) and beyond.

Title: Orthogonal Time-Frequency Space (OTFS) Aided Media-Based Modulation System For 6G and Beyond Wireless Communications Networks
Authors: Burak Ahmet Ozden, Murat Kaymaz, Erdogan Aydin, Emir Aslandogan, Haci Ilhan, Ertugrul Basar, Miaowen Wen, Marco Di Renzo
Abstract: This paper proposes a new orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS)-based index modulation system called OTFS-aided media-based modulation (MBM) scheme (OTFS-MBM), which is a promising technique for high-mobility wireless communication systems. The OTFS technique transforms information into the delay-Doppler domain, providing robustness against channel variations, while the MBM system utilizes controllable radio frequency (RF) mirrors to enhance spectral efficiency. The combination of these two techniques offers improved bit error rate (BER) performance compared to conventional OTFS and OTFS-based spatial modulation (OTFS-SM) systems. The proposed system is evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations over high-mobility Rayleigh channels for various system parameters. Comparative throughput, spectral efficiency, and energy efficiency analyses are presented, and it is shown that OTFS-MBM outperforms traditional OTFS and OTFS-SM techniques. The proposed OTFS-MBM scheme stands out as a viable solution for sixth generation (6G) and next-generation wireless networks, enabling reliable communication in dynamic wireless environments.

Title: DiTSE: High-Fidelity Generative Speech Enhancement via Latent Diffusion Transformers
Authors: Heitor R. Guimarães, Jiaqi Su, Rithesh Kumar, Tiago H. Falk, Zeyu Jin
Abstract: Real-world speech recordings suffer from degradations such as background noise and reverberation. Speech enhancement aims to mitigate these issues by generating clean high-fidelity signals. While recent generative approaches for speech enhancement have shown promising results, they still face two major challenges: (1) content hallucination, where plausible phonemes generated differ from the original utterance; and (2) inconsistency, failing to preserve speaker's identity and paralinguistic features from the input speech. In this work, we introduce DiTSE (Diffusion Transformer for Speech Enhancement), which addresses quality issues of degraded speech in full bandwidth. Our approach employs a latent diffusion transformer model together with robust conditioning features, effectively addressing these challenges while remaining computationally efficient. Experimental results from both subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate that DiTSE achieves state-of-the-art audio quality that, for the first time, matches real studio-quality audio from the DAPS dataset. Furthermore, DiTSE significantly improves the preservation of speaker identity and content fidelity, reducing hallucinations across datasets compared to state-of-the-art enhancers.

Title: Modeling Scrap Composition in Electric Arc and Basic Oxygen Furnaces
Authors: Yiqing Zhou, Karsten Naert, Dirk Nuyens
Abstract: This article aims to determine the composition of scrap (recycled material) used in an Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) or basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) based on the assumption of mass balance. Accurate knowledge of this composition can increase the usage of recycled material to produce steel, reducing the need for raw ore extraction and minimizing environmental impact by conserving natural resources and lowering carbon emissions. The study develops two models to describe the behavior of elements in the EAF or BOF process. A linear state space model is used for elements transferring completely from scrap to steel, while a non-linear state space model is applied to elements moving into both steel and slag. The Kalman filter and unscented Kalman filter are employed to approximate these models, respectively. Importantly, the models leverage only data already collected as part of the standard production process, avoiding the need for additional measurements that are often costly. This article outlines the formulation of both models, the algorithms used, and discusses the hyperparameters involved. We provide practical suggestions on how to choose appropriate hyperparameters based on expert knowledge and historical data. The models are applied to real BOF data. Cu and Cr are chosen as examples for linear and non-linear models, respectively. The results show that both models can reconstruct the composition of scrap for these elements. The findings provide valuable insights for improving process control and ensuring product quality in steelmaking.

Title: Wavefront Estimation From a Single Measurement: Uniqueness and Algorithms
Authors: Nicholas Chimitt, Ali Almuallem, Qi Guo, Stanley H. Chan
Abstract: Wavefront estimation is an essential component of adaptive optics where the goal is to recover the underlying phase from its Fourier magnitude. While this may sound identical to classical phase retrieval, wavefront estimation faces more strict requirements regarding uniqueness as adaptive optics systems need a unique phase to compensate for the distorted wavefront. Existing real-time wavefront estimation methodologies are dominated by sensing via specialized optical hardware due to their high speed, but they often have a low spatial resolution. A computational method that can perform both fast and accurate wavefront estimation with a single measurement can improve resolution and bring new applications such as real-time passive wavefront estimation, opening the door to a new generation of medical and defense applications. In this paper, we tackle the wavefront estimation problem by observing that the non-uniqueness is related to the geometry of the pupil shape. By analyzing the source of ambiguities and breaking the symmetry, we present a joint optics-algorithm approach by co-designing the shape of the pupil and the reconstruction neural network. Using our proposed lightweight neural network, we demonstrate wavefront estimation of a phase of size $128\times 128$ at $5,200$ frames per second on a CPU computer, achieving an average Strehl ratio up to $0.98$ in the noiseless case. We additionally test our method on real measurements using a spatial light modulator. Code is available at this https URL.

Title: Computationally iterative methods for salt-and-pepper denoising
Authors: Jianwei Ke
Abstract: Image restoration refers to the process of reconstructing noisy, destroyed, or missing parts of an image, which is an ill-posed inverse problem. A specific regularization term and image degradation are typically assumed to achieve well-posedness. Based on the underlying assumption, an image restoration problem can be modeled as a linear or non-linear optimization problem with or without regularization, which can be solved by iterative methods. In this work, we propose two different iterative methods by linearizing a system of non-linear equations and coupling them with a two-phase iterative framework. The qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate the correctness and efficiency of the proposed methods.

Title: Deep Mismatch Channel Estimation in IRS based 6G Communication
Authors: Swapnil Saha, Md. Forkan Uddin
Abstract: We propose a channel estimation protocol to determine the uplink channel state information (CSI) at the base station for an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) based wireless communication. More specifically, we develop a channel estimation scheme in a multi-user system with high estimation accuracy and low computational complexity. One of the state-of-the-art approaches to channel estimation is the deep learning-based approach. However, the data-driven model often experiences high computational complexity and, thus, is slow to channel estimation. Inspired by the success of utilizing domain knowledge to build effective data-driven models, the proposed scheme uses the high channel correlation property to train a shallow deep learning model. More specifically, utilizing the one coherent channel estimation, the model predicts the subsequent channel coherence CSI. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and spectral efficiency (SE) via simulation. The proposed scheme can estimate the CSI with reasonable success of lower NMSE, higher SE, and lower estimation time than existing schemes.

Title: Appointed-Time Fault-Tolerant Control for Flexible Hypersonic Vehicles with Unmeasurable States Independent of Initial Errors
Authors: Tianlong Zhao, Fei Hao
Abstract: This article aims to derive a practical tracking control algorithm for flexible air-breathing hypersonic vehicles (FAHVs) with lumped disturbances, unmeasurable states and actuator failures. Based on the framework of the backstepping technique, an appointed-time fault-tolerant protocol independent of initial errors is proposed. Firstly, a new type of a state observer is constructed to reconstruct the unmeasurable states. Then, an error transformation function is designed to achieve prescribed performance control that does not depend on the initial tracking error. To deal with the actuator failures, practical fixed-time neural network observers are established to provide the estimation of the lumped disturbances. Finally, the proposed control strategy can ensure the practical fixed-time convergence of the closed-loop system, thereby greatly enhancing the transient performance. The proposed method addresses the challenges of ensuring real-time measurement accuracy for angle of attack and flight path angle in hypersonic vehicles, coupled with potential sudden actuator failures, effectively overcoming the drawback of prescribed performance control that requires knowledge of initial tracking errors. Some simulation results are provided to demonstrate the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed strategy

Title: Predicting ulcer in H&E images of inflammatory bowel disease using domain-knowledge-driven graph neural network
Authors: Ruiwen Ding, Lin Li, Rajath Soans, Tosha Shah, Radha Krishnan, Marc Alexander Sze, Sasha Lukyanov, Yash Deshpande, Antong Chen
Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves chronic inflammation of the digestive tract, with treatment options often burdened by adverse effects. Identifying biomarkers for personalized treatment is crucial. While immune cells play a key role in IBD, accurately identifying ulcer regions in whole slide images (WSIs) is essential for characterizing these cells and exploring potential therapeutics. Multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches have advanced WSI analysis but they lack spatial context awareness. In this work, we propose a weakly-supervised model called DomainGCN that employs a graph convolution neural network (GCN) and incorporates domain-specific knowledge of ulcer features, specifically, the presence of epithelium, lymphocytes, and debris for WSI-level ulcer prediction in IBD. We demonstrate that DomainGCN outperforms various state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods and show the added value of domain knowledge.

Authors: Zhaoyang Ming, Shanpu Shen, Junhui Rao, Zan Li, Jichen Zhang, Chi Yuk Chiu, Ross Murch
Abstract: A hybrid transmitting and reflecting beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) design is proposed. Operating in the same aperture, frequency band and polarization, the proposed BD-RIS features independent beam steering control of its reflected and transmitted waves. In addition it provides a hybrid mode with both reflected and transmitted waves using tunable power splitting between beams. The BD-RIS comprises two phase reconfigurable antenna arrays interconnected by an array of tunable two-port power splitters. The two-port power splitter in each BD-RIS cell is built upon a varactor in parallel with a bias inductor to exert tunable impedance variations on transmission lines. Provided with variable reverse DC voltages, the two-port power splitter can control the power ratio of S11 over S21 from -20 dB to 20 dB, thus allowing tunable power splitting. Each antenna is 2-bit phase reconfigurable with 200 MHz bandwidth at 2.4 GHz so that each cell of BD-RIS can also achieve independent reflection and transmission phase control. To characterize and optimize the electromagnetic response of the proposed BD-RIS design, a Thévenin equivalent model and corresponding analytical method is provided. A BD-RIS with 4 by 4 cells was also prototyped and tested. Experiments show that in reflection and transmission mode, the fabricated BD-RIS can realize beam steering in reflection and transmission space, respectively. It is also verified that when operating in hybrid mode, the BD-RIS enables independent beam steering of the reflected and transmitted waves. This work helps fill the gap between realizing practical hardware design and establishing an accurate physical model for the hybrid transmitting and reflecting BD-RIS, enabling hybrid transmitting and reflecting BD-RIS assisted wireless communications.

Title: Millimeter-Wave Joint Radar and Communications With an RIS-Integrated Array
Authors: Steven Rivetti, Ozlem Tugfe Demir, Emil Bjornson, Mikael Skoglund
Abstract: In the context of the joint radar and communications (JRC) framework, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) emerged as a promising technology for their ability to shape the propagation environment by adjusting their phase-shift coefficients. However, achieving perfect synchronization and effective collaboration between access points (APs) and RISs is crucial to successful operation. This paper investigates the performance of a bistatic JRC network operating in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency band, where the receiving AP is equipped with an RIS-integrated array. This system simultaneously serves multiple UEs while estimating the position of a target with limited prior knowledge of its position. To achieve this, we optimize both the power allocation of the transmitted waveform and the RIS phase-shift matrix to minimize the position error bound (PEB) of the target. At the same time, we ensure that the UEs achieve an acceptable level of spectral efficiency. The numerical results show that an RIS-integrated array, even with a small number of receiving antennas, can achieve high localization accuracy. Additionally, optimized phase-shifts significantly improve the localization accuracy in comparison to a random phase-shift configuration.

Title: HBS -- Hardware Build System: A Tcl-based, minimal common abstraction approach for build system for hardware designs
Authors: Michał Kruszewski
Abstract: Build systems become an indispensable part of the software implementation and deployment process. New programming languages are released with the build system integrated into the language tools, for example, Go, Rust, or Zig. However, in the hardware description domain, no official build systems have been released with the predominant Hardware Description Languages (HDL) such as VHDL or SystemVerilog. Moreover, hardware design projects are often multilanguage. The paper proposes a new build system for the hardware description domain. The system is called the Hardware Build System (HBS). The main goals of the system include simplicity, readability, a minimal number of dependencies, and ease of integration with the existing Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools. The system proposes a novel, minimal common abstraction approach, whose particular implications are described in the article. All the core functionalities are implemented in Tcl. Only the EDA tool's independent features, such as dependency graph generation, are implemented in a Python wrapper.

Title: OmniMamba4D: Spatio-temporal Mamba for longitudinal CT lesion segmentation
Authors: Justin Namuk Kim, Yiqiao Liu, Rajath Soans, Keith Persson, Sarah Halek, Michal Tomaszewski, Jianda Yuan, Gregory Goldmacher, Antong Chen
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of longitudinal CT scans is important for monitoring tumor progression and evaluating treatment responses. However, existing 3D segmentation models solely focus on spatial information. To address this gap, we propose OmniMamba4D, a novel segmentation model designed for 4D medical images (3D images over time). OmniMamba4D utilizes a spatio-temporal tetra-orientated Mamba block to effectively capture both spatial and temporal features. Unlike traditional 3D models, which analyze single-time points, OmniMamba4D processes 4D CT data, providing comprehensive spatio-temporal information on lesion progression. Evaluated on an internal dataset comprising of 3,252 CT scans, OmniMamba4D achieves a competitive Dice score of 0.682, comparable to state-of-the-arts (SOTA) models, while maintaining computational efficiency and better detecting disappeared lesions. This work demonstrates a new framework to leverage spatio-temporal information for longitudinal CT lesion segmentation.

Title: Nonlinear Online Optimization for Vehicle-Home-Grid Integration including Household Load Prediction and Battery Degradation
Authors: Francesco Popolizio, Torsten Wik, Chih Feng Lee, Changfu Zou
Abstract: This paper investigates the economic impact of vehicle-home-grid integration, by proposing an online energy management algorithm that optimizes energy flows between an electric vehicle (EV), a household, and the electrical grid. The algorithm leverages vehicle-to-home (V2H) for self-consumption and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) for energy trading, adapting to real-time conditions through a hybrid long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network for accurate household load prediction, alongside a comprehensive nonlinear battery degradation model accounting for both cycle and calendar aging. Simulation results reveal significant economic advantages: compared to smart unidirectional charging, the proposed method yields an annual economic benefit of up to EUR 3046.81, despite a modest 1.96% increase in battery degradation. Even under unfavorable market conditions, where V2G energy selling generates no revenue, V2H alone ensures yearly savings of EUR 425.48. A systematic sensitivity analysis investigates how variations in battery capacity, household load, and price ratios affect economic outcomes, confirming the consistent benefits of bidirectional energy exchange. These findings highlight the potential of EVs as active energy nodes, enabling sustainable energy management and cost-effective battery usage in real-world conditions.

Title: Quantum Manifold Optimization: A Design Framework for Future Communications Systems
Authors: Getuar Rexhepi, Hyeon Seok Rou, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu
Abstract: Inspired by recent developments in various areas of science relevant to quantum computing, we introduce quantum manifold optimization (QMO) as a promising framework for solving constrained optimization problems in next-generation wireless communication systems. We begin by showing how classical wireless design problems - such as pilot design in cell-free (CF)-massive MIMO (mMIMO), beamformer optimization in gigantic multiple input multiple output (MIMO), and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) phase tuning - naturally reside on structured manifolds like the Stiefel, Grassmannian, and oblique manifolds, with the latter novelly formulated in this work. Then, we demonstrate how these problems can be reformulated as trace-based quantum expectation values over variationally-encoded quantum states. While theoretical in scope, the work lays a foundation for a new class of quantum optimization algorithms with broad application to the design of future beyond-sixth-generation (B6G) systems.

Title: Simultaneous Input and State Estimation under Output Quantization: A Gaussian Mixture approach
Authors: Rodrigo A. González, Angel L. Cedeño
Abstract: Simultaneous Input and State Estimation (SISE) enables the reconstruction of unknown inputs and internal states in dynamical systems, with applications in fault detection, robotics, and control. While various methods exist for linear systems, extensions to systems with output quantization are scarce, and formal connections to limit Kalman filters in this context are lacking. This work addresses these gaps by proposing a novel SISE algorithm for linear systems with quantized output measurements that is based on a Gaussian mixture model formulation. The observation model is represented as a Gaussian sum density, leading to closed-form recursive equations in the form of a Gaussian sum filter. In the absence of input prior knowledge, the recursions converge to a limit-case SISE algorithm, implementable as a bank of linear SISE filters running in parallel. A simulation example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Title: Learning-based decentralized control with collision avoidance for multi-agent systems
Authors: Omayra Yago Nieto, Alexandre Anahory Simoes, Juan I. Giribet, Leonardo J. Colombo
Abstract: In this paper, we present a learning-based tracking controller based on Gaussian processes (GP) for collision avoidance of multi-agent systems where the agents evolve in the special Euclidean group in the space SE(3). In particular, we use GPs to estimate certain uncertainties that appear in the dynamics of the agents. The control algorithm is designed to learn and mitigate these uncertainties by using GPs as a learning-based model for the predictions. In particular, the presented approach guarantees that the tracking error remains bounded with high probability. We present some simulation results to show how the control algorithm is implemented.

Title: Enhanced Filterless Multi-Color VLC via QCT
Authors: Idris Cinemre, Serkan Vela, Gokce Hacioglu
Abstract: Color shift keying (CSK) in visible light communication (VLC) often suffers from filter-induced crosstalk and reduced brightness. This paper proposes using quartered composite transform (QCT) with multi-color light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to improve both illumination and communication. The proposd DC-biased QCT scheme eliminates receiver optical filters, thereby removing crosstalk and significantly increasing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Simulations demonstrate QCT maintains high illumination quality (CRI 79.72, CCT 3462 K) while achieving over double the average illuminance compared to CSK under the same power budget. QCT also shows better bit error rate (BER) performance in low-to-moderate SNR regimes and has ability to convert multi-tap frequency-selective channel into an equivalent single-tap flat-fading channel to mitigate inter-symbol interference (ISI), proving a promising technique for brighter, high-performance, filter-less VLC.

Title: Hybrid Lyapunov and Barrier Function-Based Control with Stabilization Guarantees
Authors: Hugo Matias, Daniel Silvestre
Abstract: Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) can be combined, typically by means of Quadratic Programs (QPs), to design controllers that achieve performance and safety objectives. However, a significant limitation of this framework is the introduction of asymptotically stable equilibrium points besides the minimizer of the CLF, leading to deadlock situations even for simple systems and bounded convex unsafe sets. To address this problem, we propose a hybrid CLF-CBF control framework with global asymptotic stabilization and safety guarantees, offering a more flexible and systematic design methodology compared to current alternatives available in the literature. We further extend this framework to higher-order systems via a recursive procedure based on a joint CLF-CBF backstepping approach. The proposed solution is assessed through several simulation examples.

Title: Robust Output-Feedback MPC for Nonlinear Systems with Applications to Robotic Exploration
Authors: Scott Brown, Mohammad Khajenejad, Aamodh Suresh, Sonia Martinez
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for robust output-feedback model predictive control (MPC) for a class of nonlinear discrete-time systems. We propose a novel interval-valued predictor which, given an initial estimate of the state, produces intervals which are guaranteed to contain the future trajectory of the system. By parameterizing the control input with an initial stabilizing feedback term, we are able to reduce the width of the predicted state intervals compared to existing methods. We demonstrate this through a numerical comparison where we show that our controller performs better in the presence of large amounts of noise. Finally, we present a simulation study of a robot navigation scenario, where we incorporate a time-varying entropy term into the cost function in order to autonomously explore an uncertain area.

Title: Computationally Efficient State and Model Estimation via Interval Observers for Partially Unknown Systems
Authors: Mohammad Khajenejad, Zeyuan Jin
Abstract: This paper addresses the synthesis of interval observers for partially unknown nonlinear systems subject to bounded noise, aiming to simultaneously estimate system states and learn a model of the unknown dynamics. Our approach leverages Jacobian sign-stable (JSS) decompositions, tight decomposition functions for nonlinear systems, and a data-driven over-approximation framework to construct interval estimates that provably enclose the true augmented states. By recursively computing tight and tractable bounds for the unknown dynamics based on current and past interval framers, we systematically integrate these bounds into the observer design. Additionally, we formulate semi-definite programs (SDP) for observer gain synthesis, ensuring input-to-state stability and optimality of the proposed framework. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the computational efficiency of our approach compared to a method previously proposed by the authors.

Title: Research and Experimental Validation for 3GPP ISAC Channel Modeling Standardization
Authors: Yuxiang Zhang, Jianhua Zhang, Jiwei Zhang, Yuanpeng Pei, Yameng Liu, Lei Tian, Tao Jiang, Guangyi Liu
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is considered a key technology in 6G networks. An accurate sensing channel model is crucial for the design and sensing performance evaluation of ISAC systems. The widely used Geometry-Based Stochastic Model (GBSM), typically applied in standardized channel modeling, mainly focuses on the statistical fading characteristics of the channel. However, it fails to capture the characteristics of targets in ISAC systems, such as their positions and velocities, as well as the impact of the targets on the background. To address this issue, this paper proposes an extended GBSM (E-GBSM) sensing channel model that incorporates newly discovered channel characteristics into a unified modeling framework. In this framework, the sensing channel is divided into target and background channels. For the target channel, the model introduces a concatenated modeling approach, while for the background channel, a parameter called the power control factor is introduced to assess impact of the target on the background channel, making the modeling framework applicable to both mono-static and bi-static sensing modes. To validate the proposed model's effectiveness, measurements of target and background channels are conducted in both indoor and outdoor scenarios, covering various sensing targets such as metal plates, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, human bodies, UAVs, and vehicles. The experimental results provide important theoretical support and empirical data for the standardization of ISAC channel modeling.

Title: Finite-Precision Conjugate Gradient Method for Massive MIMO Detection
Authors: Yiming Fang, Li Chen, Changsheng You, Dingzhu Wen, Pengcheng Zhu
Abstract: The implementation of the conjugate gradient (CG) method for massive MIMO detection is computationally challenging, especially for a large number of users and correlated channels. In this paper, we propose a low computational complexity CG detection from a finite-precision perspective. First, we develop a finite-precision CG (FP-CG) detection to mitigate the computational bottleneck of each CG iteration and provide the attainable accuracy, convergence, and computational complexity analysis to reveal the impact of finite-precision arithmetic. A practical heuristic is presented to select suitable precisions. Then, to further reduce the number of iterations, we propose a joint finite-precision and block-Jacobi preconditioned CG (FP-BJ-CG) detection. The corresponding performance analysis is also provided. Finally, simulation results validate the theoretical insights and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed detection.

Title: CKMImageNet: A Dataset for AI-Based Channel Knowledge Map Towards Environment-Aware Communication and Sensing
Authors: Zijian Wu, Di Wu, Shen Fu, Yuelong Qiu, Yong Zeng
Abstract: With the increasing demand for real-time channel state information (CSI) in sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication networks, channel knowledge map (CKM) emerges as a promising technique, offering a site-specific database that enables environment-awareness and significantly enhances communication and sensing performance by leveraging a priori wireless channel knowledge. However, efficient construction and utilization of CKMs require high-quality, massive, and location-specific channel knowledge data that accurately reflects the real-world environments. Inspired by the great success of ImageNet dataset in advancing computer vision and image understanding in artificial intelligence (AI) community, we introduce CKMImageNet, a dataset developed to bridge AI and environment-aware wireless communications and sensing by integrating location-specific channel knowledge data, high-fidelity environmental maps, and their visual representations. CKMImageNet supports a wide range of AI-driven approaches for CKM construction with spatially consistent and location-specific channel knowledge data, including both supervised and unsupervised, as well as discriminative and generative AI methods.

Title: Modelling & Steady State Compliance Testing of an Improved Time Synchronized Phasor Measurement Unit Based on IEEE Standard C37.118.1
Authors: Nisarg Trivedi
Abstract: Synchrophasor technology is an emerging and developing technology for monitoring and control of wide area measurement systems (WAMS). In an elementary WAMS, two identical phasors measured at two different locations have difference in the phase angles measured since their reference waveforms are not synchronized with each other. Phasor measurement units (PMUs) measure input phasors with respect to a common reference wave based on the atomic clock pulses received from global positioning system (GPS) satellites, eliminating variation in the measured phase angles due to distant locations of the measurement nodes. This has found tremendous applications in quick fault detection, fault location analysis, accurate current, voltage, frequency and phase angle measurements in WAMS. Commercially available PMU models are often proven to be expensive for research and development as well as for grid integration projects. This research article proposes an economic PMU model optimized for accurate steadystate performance based on recursive discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and provides results and detailed analysis of the proposed PMU model as per the steady state compliance specifications of IEEE standard C37.118.1. Results accurate up to 13 digits after decimal point are obtained through the developed PMU model for both nominal and off-nominal frequency inputs in steady state.

Title: Markov Clustering based Fully Automated Nonblocking Hierarchical Supervisory Control of Large-Scale Discrete-Event Systems
Authors: Yingying Liu, Zhaojian Cai, Kai Cai
Abstract: In this paper we revisit the abstraction-based approach to synthesize a hierarchy of decentralized supervisors and coordinators for nonblocking control of large-scale discrete-event systems (DES), and augment it with a new clustering method for automatic and flexible grouping of relevant components during the hierarchical synthesis process. This method is known as Markov clustering, which not only automatically performs grouping but also allows flexible tuning the sizes of the resulting clusters using a single parameter. Compared to the existing abstraction-based approach that lacks effective grouping method for general cases, our proposed approach based on Markov clustering provides a fully automated and effective hierarchical synthesis procedure applicable to general large-scale DES. Moreover, it is proved that the resulting hierarchy of supervisors and coordinators collectively achieves global nonblocking (and maximally permissive) controlled behavior under the same conditions as those in the existing abstraction-based approach. Finally, a benchmark case study is conducted to empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Title: Fusing Bluetooth with Pedestrian Dead Reckoning: A Floor Plan-Assisted Positioning Approach
Authors: Wenxuan Pan, Yang Yang, Mingzhe Chen, Dong Wei, Caili Guo, Shiwen Mao
Abstract: Floor plans can provide valuable prior information that helps enhance the accuracy of indoor positioning systems. However, existing research typically faces challenges in efficiently leveraging floor plan information and applying it to complex indoor layouts. To fully exploit information from floor plans for positioning, we propose a floor plan-assisted fusion positioning algorithm (FP-BP) using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR). In the considered system, a user holding a smartphone walks through a positioning area with BLE beacons installed on the ceiling, and can locate himself in real time. In particular, FP-BP consists of two phases. In the offline phase, FP-BP programmatically extracts map features from a stylized floor plan based on their binary masks, and constructs a mapping function to identify the corresponding map feature of any given position on the map. In the online phase, FP-BP continuously computes BLE positions and PDR results from BLE signals and smartphone sensors, where a novel grid-based maximum likelihood estimation (GML) algorithm is introduced to enhance BLE positioning. Then, a particle filter is used to fuse them and obtain an initial estimate. Finally, FP-BP performs post-position correction to obtain the final position based on its specific map feature. Experimental results show that FP-BP can achieve a real-time mean positioning accuracy of 1.19 m, representing an improvement of over 28% compared to existing floor plan-fused baseline algorithms.

Title: A Novel Radar Constant False Alarm Rate Detection Algorithm Based on VAMP Deep Unfolding
Authors: Haoyun Zhang, Chengyang Zhang, Xueqian Wang, Gang Li, Xiao-Ping Zhang
Abstract: The combination of deep unfolding with vector approximate message passing (VAMP) algorithm, results in faster convergence and higher sparse recovery accuracy than traditional compressive sensing approaches. However, deep unfolding alters the parameters in traditional VAMP algorithm, resulting in the unattainable distribution parameter of the recovery error of non-sparse noisy estimation via traditional VAMP, which hinders the utilization of VAMP deep unfolding in constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection in sub-Nyquist radar system. Based on VAMP deep unfolding, we provide a parameter convergence detector (PCD) to estimate the recovery error distribution parameter and implement CFAR detection. Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, both the sparse solution and non-sparse noisy estimation are utilized to estimate the distribution parameter and implement CFAR detection in PCD, which leverages both the VAMP distribution property and the improved sparse recovery accuracy provided by deep unfolding. Simulation results indicate that PCD offers improved false alarm rate control performance and higher target detection rate.

Title: Parameter Convergence Detector Based on VAMP Deep Unfolding: A Novel Radar Constant False Alarm Rate Detection Algorithm
Authors: Haoyun Zhang, Jianghong Han, Xueqian Wang, Gang Li, Xiao-Ping Zhang
Abstract: The sub-Nyquist radar framework exploits the sparsity of signals, which effectively alleviates the pressure on system storage and transmission bandwidth. Compressed sensing (CS) algorithms, such as the VAMP algorithm, are used for sparse signal processing in the sub-Nyquist radar framework. By combining deep unfolding techniques with VAMP, faster convergence and higher accuracy than traditional CS algorithms are achieved. However, deep unfolding disrupts the parameter constrains in traditional VAMP algorithm, leading to the distribution of non-sparse noisy estimation in VAMP deep unfolding unknown, and its distribution parameter unable to be obtained directly using method of traditional VAMP, which prevents the application of VAMP deep unfolding in radar constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection. To address this problem, we explore the distribution of the non-sparse noisy estimation and propose a parameter convergence detector (PCD) to achieve CFAR detection based on VAMP deep unfolding. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, PCD leverages not only the sparse solution, but also the non-sparse noisy estimation, which is used to iteratively estimate the distribution parameter and served as the test statistic in detection process. In this way, the proposed algorithm takes advantage of both the enhanced sparse recovery accuracy from deep unfolding and the distribution property of VAMP, thereby achieving superior CFAR detection performance. Additionally, the PCD requires no information about the power of AWGN in the environment, which is more suitable for practical application. The convergence performance and effectiveness of the proposed PCD are analyzed based on the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem. Numerical simulations and practical data experiments demonstrate that PCD can achieve better false alarm control and target detection performance.

Title: Fully-Adaptive and Semi-Adaptive Frequency Sweep Algorithm Exploiting Loewner-State Model for EM Simulation of Multiport Systems
Authors: Shilpa T. N., Rakesh Sinha
Abstract: This paper employs a fully adaptive and semi-adaptive frequency sweep algorithm using the Loewner matrix-based state model for the electromagnetic simulation. The proposed algorithms use two Loewner matrix models with different or the same orders with small frequency perturbation for adaptive frequency selection. The error between the two models is calculated in each iteration, and the next frequency points are selected to minimize maximum error. With the help of memory, the algorithm terminates when the error between the model and the simulation result is reached within the specified error tolerance. In the fully adaptive frequency sweep algorithm, the method starts with the minimum and maximum frequency of simulation. In the semi-adaptive algorithm, a novel approach has been proposed to determine the initial number of frequency points necessary for system interpolation based on the electrical size of the structure. The proposed algorithms have been compared with the Stoer-Bulirsch algorithm and Pradovera's minimal sampling algorithm for electromagnetic simulation. Four examples are presented using MATLAB R2024b. The results show that the proposed methods offer better performance in terms of speed, accuracy and the requirement of the minimum number of frequency samples. The proposed method shows remarkable consistency with full-wave simulation data, and the algorithm can be effectively applicable to electromagnetic simulations.

Title: Diversity Analysis for Indoor Terahertz Communication Systems under Small-Scale Fading
Authors: Almutasem Bellah Enad, Jihad Fahs, Hakim Jemaa, Hadi Sarieddeen, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri
Abstract: Harnessing diversity is fundamental to wireless communication systems, particularly in the terahertz (THz) band, where severe path loss and small-scale fading pose significant challenges to system reliability and performance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive diversity analysis for indoor THz communication systems, accounting for the combined effects of path loss and small-scale fading, with the latter modeled as an $\alpha-\mu$ distribution to reflect THz indoor channel conditions. We derive closed-form expressions for the bit error rate (BER) as a function of the reciprocal of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and propose an asymptotic expression. Furthermore, we validate these expressions through extensive simulations, which show strong agreement with the theoretical analysis, confirming the accuracy and robustness of the proposed methods. Our results show that the diversity order in THz systems is primarily determined by the combined effects of the number of independent paths, the severity of fading, and the degree of channel frequency selectivity, providing clear insights into how diversity gains can be optimized in high-frequency wireless networks.

Title: Progressive Transfer Learning for Multi-Pass Fundus Image Restoration
Authors: Uyen Phan, Ozer Can Devecioglu, Serkan Kiranyaz, Moncef Gabbouj
Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of vision impairment, making its early diagnosis through fundus imaging critical for effective treatment planning. However, the presence of poor quality fundus images caused by factors such as inadequate illumination, noise, blurring and other motion artifacts yields a significant challenge for accurate DR screening. In this study, we propose progressive transfer learning for multi pass restoration to iteratively enhance the quality of degraded fundus images, ensuring more reliable DR screening. Unlike previous methods that often focus on a single pass restoration, multi pass restoration via PTL can achieve a superior blind restoration performance that can even improve most of the good quality fundus images in the dataset. Initially, a Cycle GAN model is trained to restore low quality images, followed by PTL induced restoration passes over the latest restored outputs to improve overall quality in each pass. The proposed method can learn blind restoration without requiring any paired data while surpassing its limitations by leveraging progressive learning and fine tuning strategies to minimize distortions and preserve critical retinal features. To evaluate PTL's effectiveness on multi pass restoration, we conducted experiments on DeepDRiD, a large scale fundus imaging dataset specifically curated for diabetic retinopathy detection. Our result demonstrates state of the art performance, showcasing PTL's potential as a superior approach to iterative image quality restoration.

Title: Uniform Planar Array Based Weighted Cooperative Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio Networks
Authors: Charith Dissanayake, Saman Atapattu, Prathapasinghe Dharmawansa, Jing Fu, Sumei Sun, Kandeepan Sithamparanathan
Abstract: Cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) is essential for improving the spectrum efficiency and reliability of cognitive radio applications. Next-generation wireless communication networks increasingly employ uniform planar arrays (UPA) due to their ability to steer beamformers towards desired directions, mitigating interference and eavesdropping. However, the application of UPA-based CSS in cognitive radio remains largely unexplored. This paper proposes a multi-beam UPA-based weighted CSS (WCSS) framework to enhance detection reliability, applicable to various cognitive radio networks, including cellular, vehicular, and satellite communications. We first propose a weighting factor for commonly used energy detection (ED) and eigenvalue detection (EVD) techniques, based on the spatial variation of signal strengths resulting from UPA antenna beamforming. We then analytically characterize the performance of both weighted ED and weighted EVD by deriving closed-form expressions for false alarm and detection probabilities. Our numerical results, considering both static and dynamic user behaviors, demonstrate the superiority of WCSS in enhancing sensing performance compared to uniformly weighted detectors.

Title: Frequency Hopping Waveform Design for Secure Integrated Sensing and Communications
Authors: Ali Khandan Boroujeni, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, Stefan Köpsell, Ghazal Bagheri, Kuranage Roche Rayan Ranasinghe, Rafael F. Schaefer
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive approach to enhance the security, privacy, and sensing capabilities of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems by leveraging random frequency agility (RFA) and random pulse repetition interval (PRI) agility (RPA) techniques. The combination of these techniques, which we refer to collectively as random frequency and PRI agility (RFPA), with channel reciprocity-based key generation (CRKG) obfuscates both Doppler frequency and PRIs, significantly hindering the chances that passive adversaries can successfully estimate radar parameters. In addition, a hybrid information embedding method integrating amplitude shift keying (ASK), phase shift keying (PSK), index modulation (IM), and spatial modulation (SM) is incorporated to increase the achievable bit rate of the system significantly. Next, a sparse-matched filter receiver design is proposed to efficiently decode the embedded information with a low bit error rate (BER). Finally, a novel RFPA-based secret generation scheme using CRKG ensures secure code creation without a coordinating authority. The improved range and velocity estimation and reduced clutter effects achieved with the method are demonstrated via the evaluation of the ambiguity function (AF) of the proposed waveforms.

Title: Learning to Beamform for Cooperative Localization and Communication: A Link Heterogeneous GNN-Based Approach
Authors: Lixiang Lian, Chuanqi Bai, Yihan Xu, Huanyu Dong, Rui Cheng, Shunqing Zhang
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a key enabler for next-generation wireless networks, supporting advanced applications such as high-precision localization and environment reconstruction. Cooperative ISAC (CoISAC) further enhances these capabilities by enabling multiple base stations (BSs) to jointly optimize communication and sensing performance through coordination. However, CoISAC beamforming design faces significant challenges due to system heterogeneity, large-scale problem complexity, and sensitivity to parameter estimation errors. Traditional deep learning-based techniques fail to exploit the unique structural characteristics of CoISAC systems, thereby limiting their ability to enhance system performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Link-Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (LHGNN) for joint beamforming in CoISAC systems. Unlike conventional approaches, LHGNN models communication and sensing links as heterogeneous nodes and their interactions as edges, enabling the capture of the heterogeneous nature and intricate interactions of CoISAC systems. Furthermore, a graph attention mechanism is incorporated to dynamically adjust node and link importance, improving robustness to channel and position estimation errors. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed attention-enhanced LHGNN achieves superior communication rates while maintaining sensing accuracy under power constraints. The proposed method also exhibits strong robustness to communication channel and position estimation error.

Title: Parametric Near-Field MMSE Channel Estimation for sub-THz XL-MIMO Systems
Authors: Wen-Xuan Long, Marco Moretti, Michele Morelli, Luca Sanguinetti, Rui Chen
Abstract: Accurate channel estimation is essential for reliable communication in sub-THz extremely large (XL) MIMO systems. Deploying XL-MIMO in high-frequency bands not only increases the number of antennas, but also fundamentally alters channel propagation characteristics, placing the user equipments (UE) in the radiative near-field of the base station. This paper proposes a parametric estimation method using the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm to extract UE location data from uplink pilot signals. These parameters are used to reconstruct the spatial correlation matrix, followed by an approximation of the minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimator. Numerical results show that the proposed method outperforms the least-squares (LS) estimator in terms of the normalized mean-square error (NMSE), even without prior UE location knowledge.

Title: Joint Localization and Synchronization in Downlink Distributed MIMO
Authors: Sauradeep Dey, Musa Furkan Keskin, Dario Tagliaferri, Gonzalo Seco-Granados, Henk Wymeersch
Abstract: We investigate joint localization and synchronization in the downlink of a distributed multiple-input-multiple-output (D-MIMO) system, aiming to estimate the position and phase offset of a single-antenna user equipment (UE) using downlink transmissions of multiple phase-synchronized, multi-antenna access points (APs). We propose two transmission protocols: sequential (P1) and simultaneous (P2) AP transmissions, together with the ML estimators that either leverage (coherent estimator) or disregard phase information (non-coherent estimator). Simulation results reveal that downlink D-MIMO holds significant potential for high-accuracy localization while showing that P2 provides superior localization performance and reduced transmission latency.

We explore the consequences of gradient properties for the analysis and design of neuromorphic circuits.

Title: Exploiting Structure in MIMO Scaled Graph Analysis
Authors: Timo de Groot, Tom Oomen, Sebastiaan van den Eijnden
Abstract: Scaled graphs offer a graphical tool for analysis of nonlinear feedback systems. Although recently substantial progress has been made in scaled graph analysis, at present their use in multivariable feedback systems is limited by conservatism. In this paper, we aim to reduce this conservatism by introducing multipliers and exploit system structure in the analysis with scaled graphs. In particular, we use weighted inner products to arrive at a weighted scaled graph and combine this with a commutation property to formulate a stability result for multivariable feedback systems. We present a method for computing the weighted scaled graph of Lur'e systems based on solving sets of linear matrix inequalities, and demonstrate a significant reduction in conservatism through an example.

Abstract: The fault characteristics of inverter-based resources (IBRs) are different from conventional synchronous generators. The fault response of IBRs is non-linear due to saturation states and mainly determined by fault ride through (FRT) strategies of the associated voltage source converter (VSC). This results in prohibitively large solution times for power flows considering these short circuit characteristics, especially when the power system states change fast due to uncertainty in IBR generations. To overcome this, a phasor-domain steady state (SS) short circuit (SC) solver for IBR dominated power systems is proposed in this paper, and subsequently the developed IBR models are incorporated with a novel Jacobian-based Power Flow (PF) solver. In this multiphase PF solver, any power system components can be modeled by considering their original non-linear or linear mathematical representations. Moreover, two novel FRT strategies are proposed to fully utilize the converter capacity and to comply with IEEE-2800 2022 std and German grid code. The results are compared with the Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) simulation on the IEEE 34 test network and the 120 kV EPRI benchmark system. The developed IBR sequence domain PF model demonstrates more accurate behavior compared to the classical IBR generator model. The error in calculating the short circuit current with the proposed SC solver is less than 3%, while achieving significant speed improvements of three order of magnitudes.

Title: A moving horizon estimator for aquifer thermal energy storages
Authors: Johannes van Randenborgh, Moritz Schulze Darup
Abstract: Aquifer thermal energy storages (ATES) represent groundwater saturated aquifers that store thermal energy in the form of heated or cooled groundwater. Combining two ATES, one can harness excess thermal energy from summer (heat) and winter (cold) to support the building's heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) technology. In general, a dynamic operation of ATES throughout the year is beneficial to avoid using fossil fuel-based HVAC technology and maximize the ``green use'' of ATES. Model predictive control (MPC) with an appropriate system model may become a crucial control approach for ATES systems. Consequently, the MPC model should reflect spatial temperature profiles around ATES' boreholes to predict extracted groundwater temperatures accurately. However, meaningful predictions require the estimation of the current state of the system, as measurements are usually only at the borehole of the ATES. In control, this is often realized by model-based observers. Still, observing the state of an ATES system is non-trivial, since the model is typically hybrid. We show how to exploit the specific structure of the hybrid ATES model and design an easy-to-solve moving horizon estimator based on a quadratic program.

Title: Simulation and Experimental Validation of Optical Camera Communication
Authors: Srivathsan Chakaravarthi Narasimman, Arokiaswami Alphones
Abstract: While simulation tools for visible light communication (VLC) with photo detectors (PDs) have been widely investigated, similar tools for optical camera communication (OCC) with complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensors are lacking in this regard. Camera based VLC systems have much lower data rates owing to camera exposure times. Among the few extant OCC simulation tools, none allow for simulation of images when exposure time is greater than the signal period. An accurate simulation of the OCC system can be used to improve the data rate and quality of performance. We propose a simple simulation technique for OCC which allows to test for system performance at frequencies beyond the camera shutter speed. This will allow much needed data rate improvement by operating at the actual frequency a decoding algorithm ceases detection instead of the exposure limit used now. We have tested the accuracy of simulation by comparing the detection success rates of simulated images with experimental images. The proposed simulation technique was shown to be accurate through experimental validation for two different cameras.

Title: Towards contrast- and pathology-agnostic clinical fetal brain MRI segmentation using SynthSeg
Authors: Ziyao Shang, Misha Kaandorp, Kelly Payette, Marina Fernandez Garcia, Roxane Licandro, Georg Langs, Jordina Aviles Verdera, Jana Hutter, Bjoern Menze, Gregor Kasprian, Meritxell Bach Cuadra, Andras Jakab
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has played a crucial role in fetal neurodevelopmental research. Structural annotations of MR images are an important step for quantitative analysis of the developing human brain, with Deep learning providing an automated alternative for this otherwise tedious manual process. However, segmentation performances of Convolutional Neural Networks often suffer from domain shift, where the network fails when applied to subjects that deviate from the distribution with which it is trained on. In this work, we aim to train networks capable of automatically segmenting fetal brain MRIs with a wide range of domain shifts pertaining to differences in subject physiology and acquisition environments, in particular shape-based differences commonly observed in pathological cases. We introduce a novel data-driven train-time sampling strategy that seeks to fully exploit the diversity of a given training dataset to enhance the domain generalizability of the trained networks. We adapted our sampler, together with other existing data augmentation techniques, to the SynthSeg framework, a generator that utilizes domain randomization to generate diverse training data, and ran thorough experimentations and ablation studies on a wide range of training/testing data to test the validity of the approaches. Our networks achieved notable improvements in the segmentation quality on testing subjects with intense anatomical abnormalities (p < 1e-4), though at the cost of a slighter decrease in performance in cases with fewer abnormalities. Our work also lays the foundation for future works on creating and adapting data-driven sampling strategies for other training pipelines.

Title: Tx and Rx IQ Imbalance Compensation for JCAS in 5G NR
Authors: Andreas Meingassner, Oliver Lang, Moritz Tockner, Bernhard Plaimer, Matthias Wagner, Günther Lindorfer, Michael Hofstadler, Mario Huemer
Abstract: Beside traditional communications, joint communications and sensing (JCAS) is gaining increasing relevance as a key enabler for next-generation wireless systems. The ability to accurately transmit and receive data is the basis for high-speed communications and precise sensing, where a fundamental requirement is an accurate in-phase (I) and quadrature-phase (Q) modulation. For sensing, imperfections in IQ modulation lead to two critical issues in the range-Doppler-map (RDM) in form of an increased noise floor and the presence of ghost objects, degrading the accuracy and reliability of the information in the RDM. This paper presents a low-complex estimation and compensation method to mitigate the IQ imbalance effects. This is achieved by utilizing, amongst others, the leakage signal, which is the direct signal from the transmitter to the receiver path, and is typically the strongest signal component in the RDM. The parameters of the IQ imbalance suppression structure are estimated based on a mixed complex-/real-valued bilinear filter approach, that considers IQ imbalance in the transmitter and the receiver of the JCAS-capable user equipment (UE). The UE uses a 5G New Radio (NR)-compliant orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform with the system configuration assumed to be predefined from the communication side. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, simulations are conducted, illustrating the performance in the suppression of IQ imbalance introduced distortions in the RDM.

Title: Pseudo-Autoregressive Neural Codec Language Models for Efficient Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech Synthesis
Authors: Yifan Yang, Shujie Liu, Jinyu Li, Yuxuan Hu, Haibin Wu, Hui Wang, Jianwei Yu, Lingwei Meng, Haiyang Sun, Yanqing Liu, Yan Lu, Kai Yu, Xie Chen
Abstract: Recent zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) systems face a common dilemma: autoregressive (AR) models suffer from slow generation and lack duration controllability, while non-autoregressive (NAR) models lack temporal modeling and typically require complex designs. In this paper, we introduce a novel pseudo-autoregressive (PAR) codec language modeling approach that unifies AR and NAR modeling. Combining explicit temporal modeling from AR with parallel generation from NAR, PAR generates dynamic-length spans at fixed time steps. Building on PAR, we propose PALLE, a two-stage TTS system that leverages PAR for initial generation followed by NAR refinement. In the first stage, PAR progressively generates speech tokens along the time dimension, with each step predicting all positions in parallel but only retaining the left-most span. In the second stage, low-confidence tokens are iteratively refined in parallel, leveraging the global contextual information. Experiments demonstrate that PALLE, trained on LibriTTS, outperforms state-of-the-art systems trained on large-scale data, including F5-TTS, E2-TTS, and MaskGCT, on the LibriSpeech test-clean set in terms of speech quality, speaker similarity, and intelligibility, while achieving up to ten times faster inference speed.

Title: The Communication and Computation Trade-off in Wireless Semantic Communications
Authors: Xuyang Chen, Chong Huang, Gaojie Chen, Daquan Feng, Pei Xiao
Abstract: Semantic communications have emerged as a crucial research direction for future wireless communication networks. However, as wireless systems become increasingly complex, the demands for computation and communication resources in semantic communications continue to grow rapidly. This paper investigates the trade-off between computation and communication in wireless semantic communications, taking into consideration transmission task delay and performance constraints within the semantic communication framework. We propose a novel tradeoff metric to analyze the balance between computation and communication in semantic transmissions and employ the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to minimize this metric, thereby reducing the cost associated with balancing computation and communication. Through simulations, we analyze the tradeoff between computation and communication and demonstrate the effectiveness of optimizing this trade-off metric.

Title: Reactive power flow optimization in AC drive systems
Authors: Sanjay Chandrasekaran, Catalin Arghir, Pieder Joerg, Florian Doerfler, Silvia Mastellone
Abstract: This paper explores a limit avoidance approach in the case of input (modulation) and output (current) constraints with the aim of enhancing system availability of AC drives. Drawing on the observation that, in a certain range of reactive power, there exists a trade-off between current and modulation magnitude, we exploit this freedom and define a constrained optimization problem. We propose two approaches, one in the form of an activation-function which drives the reactive power set-point towards safety, and an approach which uses online feedback optimization to set the reactive power dynamically. Both methods compromise reactive power tracking accuracy for increased system robustness. Through a high fidelity simulation, we compare the benefits of the two methods, highlighting their effectiveness in industrial applications.

Title: A 10.8mW Mixed-Signal Simulated Bifurcation Ising Solver using SRAM Compute-In-Memory with 0.6us Time-to-Solution
Authors: Alana Marie Dee, Sajjad Moazeni
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are funda- mental for various fields ranging from finance to wireless net- works. This work presents a simulated bifurcation (SB) Ising solver in CMOS for NP-hard optimization problems. Analog domain computing led to a superior implementation of this algorithm as inherent and injected noise is required in SB Ising solvers. The architecture novelties include the use of SRAM compute-in-memory (CIM) to accelerate bifurcation as well as the generation and injection of optimal decaying noise in the analog domain. We propose a novel 10-T SRAM cell capable of performing ternary multiplication. When measured with 60- node, 50% density, random, binary MAXCUT graphs, this all- to-all connected Ising solver reliably achieves above 93% of the ground state solution in 0.6us with 10.8mW average power in TSMC 180nm CMOS. Our chip achieves an order of magnitude improvement in time-to-solution and power compared to previously proposed Ising solvers in CMOS and other platforms.

Title: Model Order Reduction of Linear Systems via $(γ,δ)$-Similarity
Authors: Shivam Bajaj, Carolyn L. Beck, Vijay Gupta
Abstract: Model order reduction aims to determine a low-order approximation of high-order models with least possible approximation errors. For application to physical systems, it is crucial that the reduced order model (ROM) is robust to any disturbance that acts on the full order model (FOM) -- in the sense that the output of the ROM remains a good approximation of that of the FOM, even in the presence of such disturbances. In this work, we present a framework for model order reduction for a class of continuous-time linear systems that ensures this property for any $L_2$ disturbance. Apart from robustness to disturbances in this sense, the proposed framework also displays other desirable properties for model order reduction: (1) a provable bound on the error defined as the $L_2$ norm of the difference between the output of the ROM and FOM, (2) preservation of stability, (3) compositionality properties and a provable error bound for arbitrary interconnected systems, (4) a provable bound on the output of the FOM when the controller designed for the ROM is used with the FOM, and finally, (5) compatibility with existing approaches such as balanced truncation and moment matching. Property (4) does not require computation of any gap metric and property (5) is beneficial as existing approaches can also be equipped with some of the preceding properties. The theoretical results are corroborated on numerical case studies, including on a building model.

Title: Bayesian Analysis of Interpretable Aging across Thousands of Lithium-ion Battery Cycles
Authors: Marc D. Berliner, Minsu Kim, Xiao Cui, Vivek N. Lam, Patrick A. Asinger, Martin Z. Bazant, William C. Chueh, Richard D. Braatz
Abstract: The Doyle-Fuller-Newman (DFN) model is a common mechanistic model for lithium-ion batteries. The reaction rate constant and diffusivity within the DFN model are key parameters that directly affect the movement of lithium ions, thereby offering explanations for cell aging. This work investigates the ability to uniquely estimate each electrode's diffusion coefficients and reaction rate constants of 95 Tesla Model 3 cells with a nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (NCA) cathode and silicon oxide--graphite (LiC$_\text{6}$--SiO$_{\text{x}}$) anode. The parameters are estimated at intermittent diagnostic cycles over the lifetime of each cell. The four parameters are estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for uncertainty quantification (UQ) for a total of 7776 cycles at discharge C-rates of C/5, 1C, and 2C. While one or more anode parameters are uniquely identifiable over every cell's lifetime, cathode parameters become identifiable at mid- to end-of-life, indicating measurable resistive growth in the cathode. The contribution of key parameters to the state of health (SOH) is expressed as a power law. This model for SOH shows a high consistency with the MCMC results performed over the overall lifespan of each cell. Our approach suggests that effective diagnosis of aging can be achieved by predicting the trajectories of the parameters contributing to cell aging. As such, extending our analysis with more physically accurate models building on DFN may lead to more identifiable parameters and further improved aging predictions.

Title: Pinching-Antenna System (PASS) Enhanced Covert Communications
Authors: Hao Jiang, Zhaolin Wang, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: A Pinching-Antenna SyStem (PASS)-assisted convert communication framework is proposed. PASS utilizes dielectric waveguides with freely positioned pinching antennas (PAs) to establish strong line-of-sight links. Capitalizing on this high reconfigurable flexibility of antennas, the potential of PASS for covert communications is investigated. 1)~For the single-waveguide single-PA (SWSP) scenario, a closed-form optimal PA position that maximizes the covert rate is first derived. Subsequently, a one-dimensional power search is employed to enable low-complexity optimization for covert communications. With antenna mobility on a scale of meters, PASS can deal with the challenging situation of the eavesdropper enjoying better channel conditions than the legal user. 2)~For the multi-waveguide multi-PA (MWMP) scenario, the positions of multiple PAs are optimized to enable effective pinching beamforming, thereby enhancing the covert rate. To address the resultant multimodal joint transmit and pinching beamforming problem, a twin particle swarm optimization (TwinPSO) approach is proposed. Numerical results demonstrate that: i)~the proposed approaches can effectively resolve the optimization problems; ii)~PASS achieves a higher covert rate than conventional fixed-position antenna architectures; and iii)~with enhanced flexibility, the MWMP setup outperforms the SWSP counterpart.

Title: Layered Multirate Control of Constrained Linear Systems
Authors: Charis Stamouli, Anastasios Tsiamis, Manfred Morari, George J. Pappas
Abstract: Layered control architectures have been a standard paradigm for efficiently managing complex constrained systems. A typical architecture consists of: i) a higher layer, where a low-frequency planner controls a simple model of the system, and ii) a lower layer, where a high-frequency tracking controller guides a detailed model of the system toward the output of the higher-layer model. A fundamental problem in this layered architecture is the design of planners and tracking controllers that guarantee both higher- and lower-layer system constraints are satisfied. Toward addressing this problem, we introduce a principled approach for layered multirate control of linear systems subject to output and input constraints. Inspired by discrete-time simulation functions, we propose a streamlined control design that guarantees the lower-layer system tracks the output of the higher-layer system with computable precision. Using this design, we derive conditions and present a method for propagating the constraints of the lower-layer system to the higher-layer system. The propagated constraints are integrated into the design of an arbitrary planner that can handle higher-layer system constraints. Our framework ensures that the output constraints of the lower-layer system are satisfied at all high-level time steps, while respecting its input constraints at all low-level time steps. We apply our approach in a scenario of motion planning, highlighting its critical role in ensuring collision avoidance.

Title: Rotatable Antenna-Enabled Secure Wireless Communication
Authors: Liang Dai, Beixiong Zheng, Qingjie Wu
Abstract: Rotatable antenna (RA) is a promising technology that exploits new spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) to improve wireless communication and sensing performance. In this letter, we investigate an RA-enabled secure communication system where confidential information is transmitted from an RA-based access point (AP) to a single-antenna legitimate user in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. We aim to maximize the achievable secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and the deflection angles of all RAs. Accordingly, we propose an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution in an iterative manner, where the generalized Rayleigh quotient-based beamforming is applied and the RAs' deflection angles are optimized by the successive convex approximation (SCA). Simulation results show that the proposed RA-enabled secure communication system achieves significant improvement in achievable secrecy rate as compared to various benchmark schemes.

Title: Dynamic Topic Analysis in Academic Journals using Convex Non-negative Matrix Factorization Method
Authors: Yang Yang, Tong Zhang, Jian Wu, Lijie Su
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models, academic topic identification and topic evolution analysis are crucial for enhancing AI's understanding capabilities. Dynamic topic analysis provides a powerful approach to capturing and understanding the temporal evolution of topics in large-scale datasets. This paper presents a two-stage dynamic topic analysis framework that incorporates convex optimization to improve topic consistency, sparsity, and interpretability. In Stage 1, a two-layer non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) model is employed to extract annual topics and identify key terms. In Stage 2, a convex optimization algorithm refines the dynamic topic structure using the convex NMF (cNMF) model, further enhancing topic integration and stability. Applying the proposed method to IEEE journal abstracts from 2004 to 2022 effectively identifies and quantifies emerging research topics, such as COVID-19 and digital twins. By optimizing sparsity differences in the clustering feature space between traditional and emerging research topics, the framework provides deeper insights into topic evolution and ranking analysis. Moreover, the NMF-cNMF model demonstrates superior stability in topic consistency. At sparsity levels of 0.4, 0.6, and 0.9, the proposed approach improves topic ranking stability by 24.51%, 56.60%, and 36.93%, respectively.

Title: Analogical Learning for Cross-Scenario Generalization: Framework and Application to Intelligent Localization
Authors: Zirui Chen, Zhaoyang Zhang, Ziqing Xing, Ridong Li, Zhaohui Yang, Richeng Jin, Chongwen Huang, Yuzhi Yang, Mérouane Debbah
Abstract: Existing learning models often exhibit poor generalization when deployed across diverse scenarios. It is mainly due to that the underlying reference frame of the data varies with the deployment environment and settings. However, despite the data of each scenario has its distinct reference frame, its generation generally follows the same underlying physical rule. Based on these findings, this article proposes a brand-new universal deep learning framework named analogical learning (AL), which provides a highly efficient way to implicitly retrieve the reference frame information associated with a scenario and then to make accurate prediction by relative analogy across scenarios. Specifically, an elegant bipartite neural network architecture called Mateformer is designed, the first part of which calculates the relativity within multiple feature spaces between the input data and a small amount of embedded data from the current scenario, while the second part uses these relativity to guide the nonlinear analogy. We apply AL to the typical multi-scenario learning problem of intelligent wireless localization in cellular networks. Extensive experiments show that AL achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, stable transferability and robust adaptation to new scenarios without any tuning, and outperforming conventional methods with a precision improvement of nearly two orders of magnitude.

Title: A Graph-Enhanced DeepONet Approach for Real-Time Estimating Hydrogen-Enriched Natural Gas Flow under Variable Operations
Authors: Sicheng Liu, Hongchang Huang, Bo Yang, Mingxuan Cai, Xu Yang, Xinping Guan
Abstract: Blending green hydrogen into natural gas presents a promising approach for renewable energy integration and fuel decarbonization. Accurate estimation of hydrogen fraction in hydrogen-enriched natural gas (HENG) pipeline networks is crucial for operational safety and efficiency, yet it remains challenging due to complex dynamics. While existing data-driven approaches adopt end-to-end architectures for HENG flow state estimation, their limited adaptability to varying operational conditions hinders practical applications. To this end, this study proposes a graph-enhanced DeepONet framework for the real-time estimation of HENG flow, especially hydrogen fractions. First, a dual-network architecture, called branch network and trunk network, is employed to characterize operational conditions and sparse sensor measurements to estimate the HENG state at targeted locations and time points. Second, a graph-enhance branch network is proposed to incorporate pipeline topology, improving the estimation accuracy in large-scale pipeline networks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior estimation accuracy for HCNG flow under varying operational conditions compared to conventional approaches.

Title: Anti-Slip AI-Driven Model-Free Control with Global Exponential Stability in Skid-Steering Robots
Authors: Mehdi Heydari Shahna, Pauli Mustalahti, Jouni Mattila
Abstract: Undesired lateral and longitudinal wheel slippage can disrupt a mobile robot's heading angle, traction, and, eventually, desired motion. This issue makes the robotization and accurate modeling of heavy-duty machinery very challenging because the application primarily involves off-road terrains, which are susceptible to uneven motion and severe slippage. As a step toward robotization in skid-steering heavy-duty robot (SSHDR), this paper aims to design an innovative robust model-free control system developed by neural networks to strongly stabilize the robot dynamics in the presence of a broad range of potential wheel slippages. Before the control design, the dynamics of the SSHDR are first investigated by mathematically incorporating slippage effects, assuming that all functional modeling terms of the system are unknown to the control system. Then, a novel tracking control framework to guarantee global exponential stability of the SSHDR is designed as follows: 1) the unknown modeling of wheel dynamics is approximated using radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs); and 2) a new adaptive law is proposed to compensate for slippage effects and tune the weights of the RBFNNs online during execution. Simulation and experimental results verify the proposed tracking control performance of a 4,836 kg SSHDR operating on slippery terrain.

Title: Spatial Audio Processing with Large Language Model on Wearable Devices
Authors: Ayushi Mishra, Yang Bai, Priyadarshan Narayanasamy, Nakul Garg, Nirupam Roy
Abstract: Integrating spatial context into large language models (LLMs) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, particularly in wearable devices. In this work, we present a novel system architecture that incorporates spatial speech understanding into LLMs, enabling contextually aware and adaptive applications for wearable technologies. Our approach leverages microstructure-based spatial sensing to extract precise Direction of Arrival (DoA) information using a monaural microphone. To address the lack of existing dataset for microstructure-assisted speech recordings, we synthetically create a dataset called OmniTalk by using the LibriSpeech dataset. This spatial information is fused with linguistic embeddings from OpenAI's Whisper model, allowing each modality to learn complementary contextual representations. The fused embeddings are aligned with the input space of LLaMA-3.2 3B model and fine-tuned with lightweight adaptation technique LoRA to optimize for on-device processing. SING supports spatially-aware automatic speech recognition (ASR), achieving a mean error of $25.72^\circ$-a substantial improvement compared to the 88.52$^\circ$ median error in existing work-with a word error rate (WER) of 5.3. SING also supports soundscaping, for example, inference how many people were talking and their directions, with up to 5 people and a median DoA error of 16$^\circ$. Our system demonstrates superior performance in spatial speech understanding while addressing the challenges of power efficiency, privacy, and hardware constraints, paving the way for advanced applications in augmented reality, accessibility, and immersive experiences.

Title: Rethinking Few-Shot Fusion: Granular Ball Priors Enable General-Purpose Deep Image Fusion
Authors: Minjie Deng, Yan Wei, Hao Zhai, An Wu, Yuncan Ouyang, Qianyao Peng
Abstract: In image fusion tasks, due to the lack of real fused images as priors, most deep learning-based fusion methods obtain global weight features from original images in large-scale data pairs to generate images that approximate real fused images. However, unlike previous studies, this paper utilizes Granular Ball adaptation to extract features in the brightness space as priors for deep networks, enabling the fusion network to converge quickly and complete the fusion task. This leads to few-shot training for a general image fusion network, and based on this, we propose the GBFF fusion method. According to the information expression division of pixel pairs in the original fused image, we classify pixel pairs with significant performance as the positive domain and non-significant pixel pairs as the boundary domain. We perform split inference in the brightness space using Granular Ball adaptation to compute weights for pixels that express information to varying degrees, generating approximate supervision images that provide priors for the neural network in the structural brightness space. Additionally, the extracted global saliency features also adaptively provide priors for setting the loss function weights of each image in the network, guiding the network to converge quickly at both global and pixel levels alongside the supervised images, thereby enhancing the expressiveness of the fused images. Each modality only used 10 pairs of images as the training set, completing the fusion task with a limited number of iterations. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the algorithm and theory, and qualitative and quantitative comparisons with SOTA methods show that this approach is highly competitive in terms of fusion time and image expressiveness.

Title: Towards On-Device Learning and Reconfigurable Hardware Implementation for Encoded Single-Photon Signal Processing
Authors: Zhenya Zang, Xingda Li, David Day Uei Li
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) enhance the accuracy and efficiency of reconstructing key parameters from time-resolved photon arrival signals recorded by single-photon detectors. However, the performance of conventional backpropagation-based DNNs is highly dependent on various parameters of the optical setup and biological samples under examination, necessitating frequent network retraining, either through transfer learning or from scratch. Newly collected data must also be stored and transferred to a high-performance GPU server for retraining, introducing latency and storage overhead. To address these challenges, we propose an online training algorithm based on a One-Sided Jacobi rotation-based Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OSOS-ELM). We fully exploit parallelism in executing OSOS-ELM on a heterogeneous FPGA with integrated ARM cores. Extensive evaluations of OSOS-ELM and OSELM demonstrate that both achieve comparable accuracy across different network dimensions (i.e., input, hidden, and output layers), while OSOS-ELM proves to be more hardware-efficient. By leveraging the parallelism of OSOS-ELM, we implement a holistic computing prototype on a Xilinx ZCU104 FPGA, which integrates a multi-core CPU and programmable logic fabric. We validate our approach through three case studies involving single-photon signal analysis: sensing through fog using commercial single-photon LiDAR, fluorescence lifetime estimation in FLIM, and blood flow index reconstruction in DCS, all utilizing one-dimensional data encoded from photonic signals. From a hardware perspective, we optimize the OSOS-ELM workload by employing multi-tasked processing on ARM CPU cores and pipelined execution on the FPGA's logic fabric. We also implement our OSOS-ELM on the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX GPU to comprehensively investigate its computing performance on another type of heterogeneous computing platform.

Title: InterQ: A DQN Framework for Optimal Intermittent Control
Authors: Shubham Aggarwal, Dipankar Maity, Tamer Başar
Abstract: In this letter, we explore the communication-control co-design of discrete-time stochastic linear systems through reinforcement learning. Specifically, we examine a closed-loop system involving two sequential decision-makers: a scheduler and a controller. The scheduler continuously monitors the system's state but transmits it to the controller intermittently to balance the communication cost and control performance. The controller, in turn, determines the control input based on the intermittently received information. Given the partially nested information structure, we show that the optimal control policy follows a certainty-equivalence form. Subsequently, we analyze the qualitative behavior of the scheduling policy. To develop the optimal scheduling policy, we propose InterQ, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm which uses a deep neural network to approximate the Q-function. Through extensive numerical evaluations, we analyze the scheduling landscape and further compare our approach against two baseline strategies: (a) a multi-period periodic scheduling policy, and (b) an event-triggered policy. The results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms both baselines. The open source implementation can be found at this https URL.

Title: Nonconvex Obstacle Avoidance using Efficient Sampling-Based Distance Functions
Authors: Paul Lutkus, Michelle S. Chong, Lars Lindemann
Abstract: We consider nonconvex obstacle avoidance where a robot described by nonlinear dynamics and a nonconvex shape has to avoid nonconvex obstacles. Obstacle avoidance is a fundamental problem in robotics and well studied in control. However, existing solutions are computationally expensive (e.g., model predictive controllers), neglect nonlinear dynamics (e.g., graph-based planners), use diffeomorphic transformations into convex domains (e.g., for star shapes), or are conservative due to convex overapproximations. The key challenge here is that the computation of the distance between the shapes of the robot and the obstacles is a nonconvex problem. We propose efficient computation of this distance via sampling-based distance functions. We quantify the sampling error and show that, for certain systems, such sampling-based distance functions are valid nonsmooth control barrier functions. We also study how to deal with disturbances on the robot dynamics in our setting. Finally, we illustrate our method on a robot navigation task involving an omnidirectional robot and nonconvex obstacles. We also analyze performance and computational efficiency of our controller as a function of the number of samples.

Title: Multi-Robot Coordination with Adversarial Perception
Authors: Rayan Bahrami, Hamidreza Jafarnejadsani
Abstract: This paper investigates the resilience of perception-based multi-robot coordination with wireless communication to online adversarial perception. A systematic study of this problem is essential for many safety-critical robotic applications that rely on the measurements from learned perception modules. We consider a (small) team of quadrotor robots that rely only on an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and the visual data measurements obtained from a learned multi-task perception module (e.g., object detection) for downstream tasks, including relative localization and coordination. We focus on a class of adversarial perception attacks that cause misclassification, mislocalization, and latency. We propose that the effects of adversarial misclassification and mislocalization can be modeled as sporadic (intermittent) and spurious measurement data for the downstream tasks. To address this, we present a framework for resilience analysis of multi-robot coordination with adversarial measurements. The framework integrates data from Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and the learned perception model for robust relative localization and state estimation in the presence of adversarially sporadic and spurious measurements. The framework allows for quantifying the degradation in system observability and stability in relation to the success rate of adversarial perception. Finally, experimental results on a multi-robot platform demonstrate the real-world applicability of our methodology for resource-constrained robotic platforms.

Title: Self-Supervised Autoencoder Network for Robust Heart Rate Extraction from Noisy Photoplethysmogram: Applying Blind Source Separation to Biosignal Analysis
Authors: Matthew B. Webster, Dongheon Lee, Joonnyong Lee
Abstract: Biosignals can be viewed as mixtures measuring particular physiological events, and blind source separation (BSS) aims to extract underlying source signals from mixtures. This paper proposes a self-supervised multi-encoder autoencoder (MEAE) to separate heartbeat-related source signals from photoplethysmogram (PPG), enhancing heart rate (HR) detection in noisy PPG data. The MEAE is trained on PPG signals from a large open polysomnography database without any pre-processing or data selection. The trained network is then applied to a noisy PPG dataset collected during the daily activities of nine subjects. The extracted heartbeat-related source signal significantly improves HR detection as compared to the original PPG. The absence of pre-processing and the self-supervised nature of the proposed method, combined with its strong performance, highlight the potential of BSS in biosignal analysis.

Title: Compliant Explicit Reference Governor for Contact Friendly Robotic Manipulators
Authors: Yaashia Gautam, Nataliya Nechyporenko, Chi-Hui Lin, Alessandro Roncone, Marco M. Nicotra
Abstract: This paper introduces the Compliant Explicit Reference Governor (C-ERG), an extension of the Explicit Reference Governor that allows the robot to operate safely while in contact with the environment. The C-ERG is an intermediate layer that can be placed between a high-level planner and a low-level controller: its role is to enforce operational constraints and to enable the smooth transition between free-motion and contact operations. The C-ERG ensures safety by limiting the total energy available to the robotic arm at the time of contact. In the absence of contact, however, the C-ERG does not penalize the system performance.

Title: Accurate Diagnosis of Respiratory Viruses Using an Explainable Machine Learning with Mid-Infrared Biomolecular Fingerprinting of Nasopharyngeal Secretions
Authors: Wenwen Zhang, Zhouzhuo Tang, Yingmei Feng, Xia Yu, Qi Jie Wang, Zhiping Lin
Abstract: Accurate identification of respiratory viruses (RVs) is critical for outbreak control and public health. This study presents a diagnostic system that combines Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) from nasopharyngeal secretions with an explainable Rotary Position Embedding-Sparse Attention Transformer (RoPE-SAT) model to accurately identify multiple RVs within 10 minutes. Spectral data (4000-00 cm-1) were collected, and the bio-fingerprint region (1800-900 cm-1) was employed for analysis. Standard normal variate (SNV) normalization and second-order derivation were applied to reduce scattering and baseline drift. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) was employed to generate saliency maps, highlighting spectral regions most relevant to classification and enhancing the interpretability of model outputs. Two independent cohorts from Beijing Youan Hospital, processed with different viral transport media (VTMs) and drying methods, were evaluated, with one including influenza B, SARS-CoV-2, and healthy controls, and the other including mycoplasma, SARS-CoV-2, and healthy controls. The model achieved sensitivity and specificity above 94.40% across both cohorts. By correlating model-selected infrared regions with known biomolecular signatures, we verified that the system effectively recognizes virus-specific spectral fingerprints, including lipids, Amide I, Amide II, Amide III, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates, and leverages their weighted contributions for accurate classification.

Title: Generation of Musical Timbres using a Text-Guided Diffusion Model
Authors: Weixuan Yuan, Qadeer Khan, Vladimir Golkov
Abstract: In recent years, text-to-audio systems have achieved remarkable success, enabling the generation of complete audio segments directly from text descriptions. While these systems also facilitate music creation, the element of human creativity and deliberate expression is often limited. In contrast, the present work allows composers, arrangers, and performers to create the basic building blocks for music creation: audio of individual musical notes for use in electronic instruments and DAWs. Through text prompts, the user can specify the timbre characteristics of the audio. We introduce a system that combines a latent diffusion model and multi-modal contrastive learning to generate musical timbres conditioned on text descriptions. By jointly generating the magnitude and phase of the spectrogram, our method eliminates the need for subsequently running a phase retrieval algorithm, as related methods do. Audio examples, source code, and a web app are available at this https URL

Title: AMNet: An Acoustic Model Network for Enhanced Mandarin Speech Synthesis
Authors: Yubing Cao, Yinfeng Yu, Yongming Li, Liejun Wang
Abstract: This paper presents AMNet, an Acoustic Model Network designed to improve the performance of Mandarin speech synthesis by incorporating phrase structure annotation and local convolution modules. AMNet builds upon the FastSpeech 2 architecture while addressing the challenge of local context modeling, which is crucial for capturing intricate speech features such as pauses, stress, and intonation. By embedding a phrase structure parser into the model and introducing a local convolution module, AMNet enhances the model's sensitivity to local information. Additionally, AMNet decouples tonal characteristics from phonemes, providing explicit guidance for tone modeling, which improves tone accuracy and pronunciation. Experimental results demonstrate that AMNet outperforms baseline models in subjective and objective evaluations. The proposed model achieves superior Mean Opinion Scores (MOS), lower Mel Cepstral Distortion (MCD), and improved fundamental frequency fitting $F0 (R^2)$, confirming its ability to generate high-quality, natural, and expressive Mandarin speech.

Title: Conformal Calibration: Ensuring the Reliability of Black-Box AI in Wireless Systems
Authors: Osvaldo Simeone, Sangwoo Park, Matteo Zecchin
Abstract: AI is poised to revolutionize telecommunication networks by boosting efficiency, automation, and decision-making. However, the black-box nature of most AI models introduces substantial risk, possibly deterring adoption by network operators. These risks are not addressed by the current prevailing deployment strategy, which typically follows a best-effort train-and-deploy paradigm. This paper reviews conformal calibration, a general framework that moves beyond the state of the art by adopting computationally lightweight, advanced statistical tools that offer formal reliability guarantees without requiring further training or fine-tuning. Conformal calibration encompasses pre-deployment calibration via uncertainty quantification or hyperparameter selection; online monitoring to detect and mitigate failures in real time; and counterfactual post-deployment performance analysis to address "what if" diagnostic questions after deployment. By weaving conformal calibration into the AI model lifecycle, network operators can establish confidence in black-box AI models as a dependable enabling technology for wireless systems.

Title: Efficient Implementation of Reinforcement Learning over Homomorphic Encryption
Authors: Jihoon Suh, Takashi Tanaka
Abstract: We investigate encrypted control policy synthesis over the cloud. While encrypted control implementations have been studied previously, we focus on the less explored paradigm of privacy-preserving control synthesis, which can involve heavier computations ideal for cloud outsourcing. We classify control policy synthesis into model-based, simulator-driven, and data-driven approaches and examine their implementation over fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) for privacy enhancements. A key challenge arises from comparison operations (min or max) in standard reinforcement learning algorithms, which are difficult to execute over encrypted data. This observation motivates our focus on Relative-Entropy-regularized reinforcement learning (RL) problems, which simplifies encrypted evaluation of synthesis algorithms due to their comparison-free structures. We demonstrate how linearly solvable value iteration, path integral control, and Z-learning can be readily implemented over FHE. We conduct a case study of our approach through numerical simulations of encrypted Z-learning in a grid world environment using the CKKS encryption scheme, showing convergence with acceptable approximation error. Our work suggests the potential for secure and efficient cloud-based reinforcement learning.

Title: Graph-Based Prediction Models for Data Debiasing
Authors: Dongze Wu, Hanyang Jiang, Yao Xie
Abstract: Bias in data collection, arising from both under-reporting and over-reporting, poses significant challenges in critical applications such as healthcare and public safety. In this work, we introduce Graph-based Over- and Under-reporting Debiasing (GROUD), a novel graph-based optimization framework that debiases reported data by jointly estimating the true incident counts and the associated reporting bias probabilities. By modeling the bias as a smooth signal over a graph constructed from geophysical or feature-based similarities, our convex formulation not only ensures a unique solution but also comes with theoretical recovery guarantees under certain assumptions. We validate GROUD on both challenging simulated experiments and real-world datasets -- including Atlanta emergency calls and COVID-19 vaccine adverse event reports -- demonstrating its robustness and superior performance in accurately recovering debiased counts. This approach paves the way for more reliable downstream decision-making in systems affected by reporting irregularities.

Title: Expressivity of Quadratic Neural ODEs
Authors: Joshua Hanson, Maxim Raginsky
Abstract: This work focuses on deriving quantitative approximation error bounds for neural ordinary differential equations having at most quadratic nonlinearities in the dynamics. The simple dynamics of this model form demonstrates how expressivity can be derived primarily from iteratively composing many basic elementary operations, versus from the complexity of those elementary operations themselves. Like the analog differential analyzer and universal polynomial DAEs, the expressivity is derived instead primarily from the "depth" of the model. These results contribute to our understanding of what depth specifically imparts to the capabilities of deep learning architectures.

Title: Ensemble-Enhanced Graph Autoencoder with GAT and Transformer-Based Encoders for Robust Fault Diagnosis
Authors: Moirangthem Tiken Singh
Abstract: Fault classification in industrial machinery is vital for enhancing reliability and reducing downtime, yet it remains challenging due to the variability of vibration patterns across diverse operating conditions. This study introduces a novel graph-based framework for fault classification, converting time-series vibration data from machinery operating at varying horsepower levels into a graph representation. We utilize Shannon's entropy to determine the optimal window size for data segmentation, ensuring each segment captures significant temporal patterns, and employ Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to define graph edges based on segment similarity. A Graph Auto Encoder (GAE) with a deep graph transformer encoder, decoder, and ensemble classifier is developed to learn latent graph representations and classify faults across various categories. The GAE's performance is evaluated on the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) dataset, with cross-dataset generalization assessed on the HUST dataset. Results show that GAE achieves a mean F1-score of 0.99 on the CWRU dataset, significantly outperforming baseline models-CNN, LSTM, RNN, GRU, and Bi-LSTM (F1-scores: 0.94-0.97, p < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test for Bi-LSTM: p < 0.05) -- particularly in challenging classes (e.g., Class 8: 0.99 vs. 0.71 for Bi-LSTM). Visualization of dataset characteristics reveals that datasets with amplified vibration patterns and diverse fault dynamics enhance generalization. This framework provides a robust solution for fault diagnosis under varying conditions, offering insights into dataset impacts on model performance.

Title: PLS-Assisted Offloading for Edge Computing-Enabled Post-Quantum Security in Resource-Constrained Devices
Authors: Hamid Amiriara, Mahtab Mirmohseni, Rahim Tafazolli
Abstract: With the advent of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standards, it has become imperative for resource-constrained devices (RCDs) in the Internet of Things (IoT) to adopt these quantum-resistant protocols. However, the high computational overhead and the large key sizes associated with PQC make direct deployment on such devices impractical. To address this challenge, we propose an edge computing-enabled PQC framework that leverages a physical-layer security (PLS)-assisted offloading strategy, allowing devices to either offload intensive cryptographic tasks to a post-quantum edge server (PQES) or perform them locally. Furthermore, to ensure data confidentiality within the edge domain, our framework integrates two PLS techniques: offloading RCDs employ wiretap coding to secure data transmission, while non-offloading RCDs serve as friendly jammers by broadcasting artificial noise to disrupt potential eavesdroppers. Accordingly, we co-design the computation offloading and PLS strategy by jointly optimizing the device transmit power, PQES computation resource allocation, and offloading decisions to minimize overall latency under resource constraints. Numerical results demonstrate significant latency reductions compared to baseline schemes, confirming the scalability and efficiency of our approach for secure PQC operations in IoT networks.

Title: Structure-Accurate Medical Image Translation based on Dynamic Frequency Balance and Knowledge Guidance
Authors: Jiahua Xu, Dawei Zhou, Lei Hu, Zaiyi Liu, Nannan Wang, Xinbo Gao
Abstract: Multimodal medical images play a crucial role in the precise and comprehensive clinical diagnosis. Diffusion model is a powerful strategy to synthesize the required medical images. However, existing approaches still suffer from the problem of anatomical structure distortion due to the overfitting of high-frequency information and the weakening of low-frequency information. Thus, we propose a novel method based on dynamic frequency balance and knowledge guidance. Specifically, we first extract the low-frequency and high-frequency components by decomposing the critical features of the model using wavelet transform. Then, a dynamic frequency balance module is designed to adaptively adjust frequency for enhancing global low-frequency features and effective high-frequency details as well as suppressing high-frequency noise. To further overcome the challenges posed by the large differences between different medical modalities, we construct a knowledge-guided mechanism that fuses the prior clinical knowledge from a visual language model with visual features, to facilitate the generation of accurate anatomical structures. Experimental evaluations on multiple datasets show the proposed method achieves significant improvements in qualitative and quantitative assessments, verifying its effectiveness and superiority.

Title: Enhancing Wide-Angle Image Using Narrow-Angle View of the Same Scene
Authors: Hussain Md. Safwan, Mahbub Islam Mahim, Fawwaz Mohammed Amin
Abstract: A common dilemma while photographing a scene is whether to capture it in wider angle, allowing more of the scene to be covered but in lesser details or to click in narrow angle that captures better details but leaves out portions of the scene. We propose a novel method in this paper that infuses wider shots with finer quality details that is usually associated with an image captured by the primary lens by capturing the same scene using both narrow and wide field of view (FoV) lenses. We do so by training a GAN-based model to learn to extract the visual quality parameters from a narrow angle shot and to transfer these to the corresponding wide-angle image of the scene. We have mentioned in details the proposed technique to isolate the visual essence of an image and to transfer it into another image. We have also elaborately discussed our implementation details and have presented the results of evaluation over several benchmark datasets and comparisons with contemporary advancements in the field.

Title: FSSUAVL: A Discriminative Framework using Vision Models for Federated Self-Supervised Audio and Image Understanding
Authors: Yasar Abbas Ur Rehman, Kin Wai Lau, Yuyang Xie, Ma Lan, JiaJun Shen
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that vision models can effectively learn multimodal audio-image representations when paired. However, the challenge of enabling deep models to learn representations from unpaired modalities remains unresolved. This issue is especially pertinent in scenarios like Federated Learning (FL), where data is often decentralized, heterogeneous, and lacks a reliable guarantee of paired data. Previous attempts tackled this issue through the use of auxiliary pretrained encoders or generative models on local clients, which invariably raise computational cost with increasing number modalities. Unlike these approaches, in this paper, we aim to address the task of unpaired audio and image recognition using \texttt{FSSUAVL}, a single deep model pretrained in FL with self-supervised contrastive learning (SSL). Instead of aligning the audio and image modalities, \texttt{FSSUAVL} jointly discriminates them by projecting them into a common embedding space using contrastive SSL. This extends the utility of \texttt{FSSUAVL} to paired and unpaired audio and image recognition tasks. Our experiments with CNN and ViT demonstrate that \texttt{FSSUAVL} significantly improves performance across various image- and audio-based downstream tasks compared to using separate deep models for each modality. Additionally, \texttt{FSSUAVL}'s capacity to learn multimodal feature representations allows for integrating auxiliary information, if available, to enhance recognition accuracy.

Title: Mixture-of-Shape-Experts (MoSE): End-to-End Shape Dictionary Framework to Prompt SAM for Generalizable Medical Segmentation
Authors: Jia Wei, Xiaoqi Zhao, Jonghye Woo, Jinsong Ouyang, Georges El Fakhri, Qingyu Chen, Xiaofeng Liu
Abstract: Single domain generalization (SDG) has recently attracted growing attention in medical image segmentation. One promising strategy for SDG is to leverage consistent semantic shape priors across different imaging protocols, scanner vendors, and clinical sites. However, existing dictionary learning methods that encode shape priors often suffer from limited representational power with a small set of offline computed shape elements, or overfitting when the dictionary size grows. Moreover, they are not readily compatible with large foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM). In this paper, we propose a novel Mixture-of-Shape-Experts (MoSE) framework that seamlessly integrates the idea of mixture-of-experts (MoE) training into dictionary learning to efficiently capture diverse and robust shape priors. Our method conceptualizes each dictionary atom as a shape expert, which specializes in encoding distinct semantic shape information. A gating network dynamically fuses these shape experts into a robust shape map, with sparse activation guided by SAM encoding to prevent overfitting. We further provide this shape map as a prompt to SAM, utilizing the powerful generalization capability of SAM through bidirectional integration. All modules, including the shape dictionary, are trained in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate its effectiveness.

Title: Data-Driven Two-Stage Distributionally Robust Dispatch of Multi-Energy Microgrid
Authors: Xunhang Sun, Xiaoyu Cao, Bo Zeng, Miaomiao Li, Xiaohong Guan, Tamer Başar
Abstract: This paper studies adaptive distributionally robust dispatch (DRD) of the multi-energy microgrid under supply and demand uncertainties. A Wasserstein ambiguity set is constructed to support data-driven decision-making. By fully leveraging the special structure of worst-case expectation from the primal perspective, a novel and high-efficient decomposition algorithm under the framework of column-and-constraint generation is customized and developed to address the computational burden. Numerical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our DRD approach, and shed light on the interrelationship of it with the traditional dispatch approaches through stochastic programming and robust optimization schemes. Also, comparisons with popular algorithms in the literature for two-stage distributionally robust optimization verify the powerful capacity of our algorithm in computing the DRD problem.

Title: On Stochastic Performance Analysis of Secure Integrated Sensing and Communication Networks
Authors: Marziyeh Soltani, Mahtab Mirmohseni, Rahim Tafazolli
Abstract: This paper analyzes the stochastic security performance of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system in a downlink scenario. A base station (BS) transmits a multi-functional signal to simultaneously communicate with a user, sense a target angular location, and counteract eavesdropping threats. The system includes a passive single-antenna communication eavesdropper and a multi-antenna sensing eavesdropper attempting to infer the target location. The BS-user and BS-eavesdroppers channels follow Rayleigh fading, while the target azimuth angle is uniformly distributed. To evaluate the performance, we derive exact expressions for the secrecy ergodic rate and the ergodic Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB) for target localization at both the BS and the sensing eavesdropper. This involves computing the probability density functions (PDFs) of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and CRB, leveraging the central limit theorem for tractability. Numerical results validate our findings.

Title: SegOTA: Accelerating Over-the-Air Federated Learning with Segmented Transmission
Authors: Chong Zhang, Min Dong, Ben Liang, Ali Afana, Yahia Ahmed
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) with over-the-air computation efficiently utilizes the communication resources, but it can still experience significant latency when each device transmits a large number of model parameters to the server. This paper proposes the Segmented Over-The-Air (SegOTA) method for FL, which reduces latency by partitioning devices into groups and letting each group transmit only one segment of the model parameters in each communication round. Considering a multi-antenna server, we model the SegOTA transmission and reception process to establish an upper bound on the expected model learning optimality gap. We minimize this upper bound, by formulating the per-round online optimization of device grouping and joint transmit-receive beamforming, for which we derive efficient closed-form solutions. Simulation results show that our proposed SegOTA substantially outperforms the conventional full-model OTA approach and other common alternatives.

Title: Accelerating Ray Tracing-Based Wireless Channels Generation for Real-Time Network Digital Twins
Authors: Cláudio Modesto, Lucas Mozart, Pedro Batista, André Cavalcante, Aldebaro Klautau
Abstract: Ray tracing (RT) simulation is a widely used approach to enable modeling wireless channels in applications such as network digital twins. However, the computational cost to execute RT is proportional to factors such as the level of detail used in the adopted 3D scenario. This work proposes RT pre-processing algorithms that aim at simplifying the 3D scene without distorting the channel. It also proposes a post-processing method that augments a set of RT results to achieve an improved time resolution. These methods enable using RT in applications that use a detailed and photorealistic 3D scenario, while generating consistent wireless channels over time. Our simulation results with different 3D scenarios demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the simulation time by more than 50% without compromising the accuracy of the RT parameters.

Title: Score Matching Diffusion Based Feedback Control and Planning of Nonlinear Systems
Authors: Karthik Elamvazhuthi, Darshan Gadginmath, Fabio Pasqualetti
Abstract: We propose a novel control-theoretic framework that leverages principles from generative modeling -- specifically, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) -- to stabilize control-affine systems with nonholonomic constraints. Unlike traditional stochastic approaches, which rely on noise-driven dynamics in both forward and reverse processes, our method crucially eliminates the need for noise in the reverse phase, making it particularly relevant for control applications. We introduce two formulations: one where noise perturbs all state dimensions during the forward phase while the control system enforces time reversal deterministically, and another where noise is restricted to the control channels, embedding system constraints directly into the forward process. For controllable nonlinear drift-free systems, we prove that deterministic feedback laws can exactly reverse the forward process, ensuring that the system's probability density evolves correctly without requiring artificial diffusion in the reverse phase. Furthermore, for linear time-invariant systems, we establish a time-reversal result under the second formulation. By eliminating noise in the backward process, our approach provides a more practical alternative to machine learning-based denoising methods, which are unsuitable for control applications due to the presence of stochasticity. We validate our results through numerical simulations on benchmark systems, including a unicycle model in a domain with obstacles, a driftless five-dimensional system, and a four-dimensional linear system, demonstrating the potential for applying diffusion-inspired techniques in linear, nonlinear, and settings with state space constraints.

Title: Separate to Collaborate: Dual-Stream Diffusion Model for Coordinated Piano Hand Motion Synthesis
Authors: Zihao Liu, Mingwen Ou, Zunnan Xu, Jiaqi Huang, Haonan Han, Ronghui Li, Xiu Li
Abstract: Automating the synthesis of coordinated bimanual piano performances poses significant challenges, particularly in capturing the intricate choreography between the hands while preserving their distinct kinematic signatures. In this paper, we propose a dual-stream neural framework designed to generate synchronized hand gestures for piano playing from audio input, addressing the critical challenge of modeling both hand independence and coordination. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (i) a decoupled diffusion-based generation framework that independently models each hand's motion via dual-noise initialization, sampling distinct latent noise for each while leveraging a shared positional condition, and (ii) a Hand-Coordinated Asymmetric Attention (HCAA) mechanism suppresses symmetric (common-mode) noise to highlight asymmetric hand-specific features, while adaptively enhancing inter-hand coordination during denoising. The system operates hierarchically: it first predicts 3D hand positions from audio features and then generates joint angles through position-aware diffusion models, where parallel denoising streams interact via HCAA. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics.

Title: Digital Staining with Knowledge Distillation: A Unified Framework for Unpaired and Paired-But-Misaligned Data
Authors: Ziwang Xu, Lanqing Guo, Satoshi Tsutsui, Shuyan Zhang, Alex C. Kot, Bihan Wen
Abstract: Staining is essential in cell imaging and medical diagnostics but poses significant challenges, including high cost, time consumption, labor intensity, and irreversible tissue alterations. Recent advances in deep learning have enabled digital staining through supervised model training. However, collecting large-scale, perfectly aligned pairs of stained and unstained images remains difficult. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised deep learning framework for digital cell staining that reduces the need for extensive paired data using knowledge distillation. We explore two training schemes: (1) unpaired and (2) paired-but-misaligned settings. For the unpaired case, we introduce a two-stage pipeline, comprising light enhancement followed by colorization, as a teacher model. Subsequently, we obtain a student staining generator through knowledge distillation with hybrid non-reference losses. To leverage the pixel-wise information between adjacent sections, we further extend to the paired-but-misaligned setting, adding the Learning to Align module to utilize pixel-level information. Experiment results on our dataset demonstrate that our proposed unsupervised deep staining method can generate stained images with more accurate positions and shapes of the cell targets in both settings. Compared with competing methods, our method achieves improved results both qualitatively and quantitatively (e.g., NIQE and PSNR).We applied our digital staining method to the White Blood Cell (WBC) dataset, investigating its potential for medical applications.

Title: Passive Channel Charting: Locating Passive Targets using Wi-Fi Channel State Information
Authors: Florian Euchner, David Kellner, Phillip Stephan, Stephan ten Brink
Abstract: We propose passive channel charting, an extension of channel charting to passive target localization. As in conventional channel charting, we follow a dimensionality reduction approach to reconstruct a physically interpretable map of target positions from similarities in high-dimensional channel state information. We show that algorithms and neural network architectures developed in the context of channel charting with active mobile transmitters can be straightforwardly applied to the passive case, where we assume a scenario with static transmitters and receivers and a mobile target. We evaluate our method on a channel state information dataset collected indoors with a distributed setup of ESPARGOS Wi-Fi sensing antenna arrays. This scenario can be interpreted as either a multi-static or passive radar system. We demonstrate that passive channel charting outperforms a baseline based on classical triangulation in terms of localization accuracy. We discuss our results and highlight some unsolved issues related to the proposed concept.

Title: Towards Resilient Tracking in Autonomous Vehicles: A Distributionally Robust Input and State Estimation Approach
Authors: Kasra Azizi, Kumar Anurag, Wenbin Wan
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for the distributionally robust input and state estimation (DRISE) for autonomous vehicles operating under model uncertainties and measurement outliers. The proposed framework improves the input and state estimation (ISE) approach by integrating distributional robustness, enhancing the estimator's resilience and robustness to adversarial inputs and unmodeled dynamics. Moment-based ambiguity sets capture probabilistic uncertainties in both system dynamics and measurement noise, offering analytical tractability and efficiently handling uncertainties in mean and covariance. In particular, the proposed framework minimizes the worst-case estimation error, ensuring robustness against deviations from nominal distributions. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through simulations conducted in the CARLA autonomous driving simulator, demonstrating improved performance in state estimation accuracy and robustness in dynamic and uncertain environments.

Title: Turn-taking annotation for quantitative and qualitative analyses of conversation
Authors: Anneliese Kelterer, Barbara Schuppler
Abstract: This paper has two goals. First, we present the turn-taking annotation layers created for 95 minutes of conversational speech of the Graz Corpus of Read and Spontaneous Speech (GRASS), available to the scientific community. Second, we describe the annotation system and the annotation process in more detail, so other researchers may use it for their own conversational data. The annotation system was developed with an interdisciplinary application in mind. It should be based on sequential criteria according to Conversation Analysis, suitable for subsequent phonetic analysis, thus time-aligned annotations were made Praat, and it should be suitable for automatic classification, which required the continuous annotation of speech and a label inventory that is not too large and results in a high inter-rater agreement. Turn-taking was annotated on two layers, Inter-Pausal Units (IPU) and points of potential completion (PCOMP; similar to transition relevance places). We provide a detailed description of the annotation process and of segmentation and labelling criteria. A detailed analysis of inter-rater agreement and common confusions shows that agreement for IPU annotation is near-perfect, that agreement for PCOMP annotations is substantial, and that disagreements often are either partial or can be explained by a different analysis of a sequence which also has merit. The annotation system can be applied to a variety of conversational data for linguistic studies and technological applications, and we hope that the annotations, as well as the annotation system will contribute to a stronger cross-fertilization between these disciplines.

Title: Learning to Harmonize Cross-vendor X-ray Images by Non-linear Image Dynamics Correction
Authors: Yucheng Lu, Shunxin Wang, Dovile Juodelyte, Veronika Cheplygina
Abstract: In this paper, we explore how conventional image enhancement can improve model robustness in medical image analysis. By applying commonly used normalization methods to images from various vendors and studying their influence on model generalization in transfer learning, we show that the nonlinear characteristics of domain-specific image dynamics cannot be addressed by simple linear transforms. To tackle this issue, we reformulate the image harmonization task as an exposure correction problem and propose a method termed Global Deep Curve Estimation (GDCE) to reduce domain-specific exposure mismatch. GDCE performs enhancement via a pre-defined polynomial function and is trained with the help of a ``domain discriminator'', aiming to improve model transparency in downstream tasks compared to existing black-box methods.

Abstract: Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders continue to be a major challenge in industrial environments, leading to reduced workforce participation, increased healthcare costs, and long-term disability. This study introduces a human-sensitive robotic system aimed at reintegrating individuals with a history of musculoskeletal disorders into standard job roles, while simultaneously optimizing ergonomic conditions for the broader workforce. This research leverages reinforcement learning to develop a human-aware control strategy for collaborative robots, focusing on optimizing ergonomic conditions and preventing pain during task execution. Two RL approaches, Q-Learning and Deep Q-Network (DQN), were implemented and tested to personalize control strategies based on individual user characteristics. Although experimental results revealed a simulation-to-real gap, a fine-tuning phase successfully adapted the policies to real-world conditions. DQN outperformed Q-Learning by completing tasks faster while maintaining zero pain risk and safe ergonomic levels. The structured testing protocol confirmed the system's adaptability to diverse human anthropometries, underscoring the potential of RL-driven cobots to enable safer, more inclusive workplaces.

Title: Uncertainty Propagation in the Fast Fourier Transform
Authors: Luca Schmid, Charlotte Muth, Laurent Schmalen
Abstract: We address the problem of uncertainty propagation in the discrete Fourier transform by modeling the fast Fourier transform as a factor graph. Building on this representation, we propose an efficient framework for approximate Bayesian inference using belief propagation (BP) and expectation propagation, extending its applicability beyond Gaussian assumptions. By leveraging an appropriate BP message representation and a suitable schedule, our method achieves stable convergence with accurate mean and variance estimates. Numerical experiments in representative scenarios from communications demonstrate the practical potential of the proposed framework for uncertainty-aware inference in probabilistic systems operating across both time and frequency domain.

Title: Multi-Target Position Error Bound and Power Allocation Scheme for Cell-Free mMIMO-OTFS ISAC Systems
Authors: Yifei Fan, Shaochuan Wu, Haojie Wang, Mingjun Sun, Jianhe Wang
Abstract: This paper investigates multi-target position estimation in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF mMIMO) architectures, where orthogonal time frequency and space (OTFS) is used as an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) signal. Closed-form expressions for the Cramér-Rao lower bound and the positioning error bound (PEB) in multi-target position estimation are derived, providing quantitative evaluations of sensing performance. To enhance the overall performance of the ISAC system, a power allocation algorithm is developed to maximize the minimum user communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio while ensuring a specified sensing PEB requirement. The results validate the proposed PEB expression and its approximation, clearly illustrating the coordination gain enabled by ISAC. Further, the superiority of using the multi-static CF mMIMO architecture over traditional cellular ISAC is demonstrated, and the advantages of OTFS signals in high-mobility scenarios are highlighted.

Title: Adaptive Sensor Steering Strategy Using Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Data Acquisition in Digital Twins
Authors: Collins O. Ogbodo, Timothy J. Rogers, Mattia Dal Borgo, David J. Wagg
Abstract: This paper introduces a sensor steering methodology based on deep reinforcement learning to enhance the predictive accuracy and decision support capabilities of digital twins by optimising the data acquisition process. Traditional sensor placement techniques are often constrained by one-off optimisation strategies, which limit their applicability for online applications requiring continuous informative data assimilation. The proposed approach addresses this limitation by offering an adaptive framework for sensor placement within the digital twin paradigm. The sensor placement problem is formulated as a Markov decision process, enabling the training and deployment of an agent capable of dynamically repositioning sensors in response to the evolving conditions of the physical structure as represented by the digital twin. This ensures that the digital twin maintains a highly representative and reliable connection to its physical counterpart. The proposed framework is validated through a series of comprehensive case studies involving a cantilever plate structure subjected to diverse conditions, including healthy and damaged conditions. The results demonstrate the capability of the deep reinforcement learning agent to adaptively reposition sensors improving the quality of data acquisition and hence enhancing the overall accuracy of digital twins.

Title: PG-DPIR: An efficient plug-and-play method for high-count Poisson-Gaussian inverse problems
Authors: Maud Biquard, Marie Chabert, Florence Genin, Christophe Latry, Thomas Oberlin
Abstract: Poisson-Gaussian noise describes the noise of various imaging systems thus the need of efficient algorithms for Poisson-Gaussian image restoration. Deep learning methods offer state-of-the-art performance but often require sensor-specific training when used in a supervised setting. A promising alternative is given by plug-and-play (PnP) methods, which consist in learning only a regularization through a denoiser, allowing to restore images from several sources with the same network. This paper introduces PG-DPIR, an efficient PnP method for high-count Poisson-Gaussian inverse problems, adapted from DPIR. While DPIR is designed for white Gaussian noise, a naive adaptation to Poisson-Gaussian noise leads to prohibitively slow algorithms due to the absence of a closed-form proximal operator. To address this, we adapt DPIR for the specificities of Poisson-Gaussian noise and propose in particular an efficient initialization of the gradient descent required for the proximal step that accelerates convergence by several orders of magnitude. Experiments are conducted on satellite image restoration and super-resolution problems. High-resolution realistic Pleiades images are simulated for the experiments, which demonstrate that PG-DPIR achieves state-of-the-art performance with improved efficiency, which seems promising for on-ground satellite processing chains.

Title: Deep Learning-Based Automatic Diagnosis System for Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip
Authors: Yang Li, Leo Yan Li-Han, Hua Tian
Abstract: Objective: The clinical diagnosis of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) typically involves manually measuring key radiological angles -- Center-Edge (CE), Tonnis, and Sharp angles -- from pelvic radiographs, a process that is time-consuming and susceptible to variability. This study aims to develop an automated system that integrates these measurements to enhance the accuracy and consistency of DDH diagnosis. Methods and procedures: We developed an end-to-end deep learning model for keypoint detection that accurately identifies eight anatomical keypoints from pelvic radiographs, enabling the automated calculation of CE, Tonnis, and Sharp angles. To support the diagnostic decision, we introduced a novel data-driven scoring system that combines the information from all three angles into a comprehensive and explainable diagnostic output. Results: The system demonstrated superior consistency in angle measurements compared to a cohort of eight moderately experienced orthopedists. The intraclass correlation coefficients for the CE, Tonnis, and Sharp angles were 0.957 (95% CI: 0.952--0.962), 0.942 (95% CI: 0.937--0.947), and 0.966 (95% CI: 0.964--0.968), respectively. The system achieved a diagnostic F1 score of 0.863 (95% CI: 0.851--0.876), significantly outperforming the orthopedist group (0.777, 95% CI: 0.737--0.817, p = 0.005), as well as using clinical diagnostic criteria for each angle individually (p<0.001). Conclusion: The proposed system provides reliable and consistent automated measurements of radiological angles and an explainable diagnostic output for DDH, outperforming moderately experienced clinicians. Clinical impact: This AI-powered solution reduces the variability and potential errors of manual measurements, offering clinicians a more consistent and interpretable tool for DDH diagnosis.

Title: Label-free segmentation from cardiac ultrasound using self-supervised learning
Authors: Danielle L. Ferreira, Connor Lau, Zaynaf Salaymang, Rima Arnaout
Abstract: Segmentation and measurement of cardiac chambers is critical in cardiac ultrasound but is laborious and poorly reproducible. Neural networks can assist, but supervised approaches require the same laborious manual annotations. We built a pipeline for self-supervised (no manual labels) segmentation combining computer vision, clinical domain knowledge, and deep learning. We trained on 450 echocardiograms (93,000 images) and tested on 8,393 echocardiograms (4,476,266 images; mean 61 years, 51% female), using the resulting segmentations to calculate biometrics. We also tested against external images from an additional 10,030 patients with available manual tracings of the left ventricle. r2 between clinically measured and pipeline-predicted measurements were similar to reported inter-clinician variation and comparable to supervised learning across several different measurements (r2 0.56-0.84). Average accuracy for detecting abnormal chamber size and function was 0.85 (range 0.71-0.97) compared to clinical measurements. A subset of test echocardiograms (n=553) had corresponding cardiac MRIs, where MRI is the gold standard. Correlation between pipeline and MRI measurements was similar to that between clinical echocardiogram and MRI. Finally, the pipeline accurately segments the left ventricle with an average Dice score of 0.89 (95% CI [0.89]) in the external, manually labeled dataset. Our results demonstrate a manual-label free, clinically valid, and highly scalable method for segmentation from ultrasound, a noisy but globally important imaging modality.

Title: STLCCP: Efficient Convex Optimization-based Framework for Signal Temporal Logic Specifications
Authors: Yoshinari Takayama, Kazumune Hashimoto, Toshiyuki Ohtsuka
Abstract: Signal temporal logic (STL) is a powerful formalism for specifying various temporal properties in dynamical systems. However, existing methods, such as mixed-integer programming and nonlinear programming, often struggle to efficiently solve control problems with complex, long-horizon STL specifications. This study introduces \textit{STLCCP}, a novel convex optimization-based framework that leverages key structural properties of STL: monotonicity of the robustness function, its hierarchical tree structure, and correspondence between convexity/concavity in optimizations and conjunctiveness/disjunctiveness in specifications. The framework begins with a structure-aware decomposition of STL formulas, transforming the problem into an equivalent difference of convex (DC) programs. This is then solved sequentially as a convex quadratic program using an improved version of the convex-concave procedure (CCP). To further enhance efficiency, we develop a smooth approximation of the robustness function using a function termed the \textit{mellowmin} function, specifically tailored to the proposed framework. Numerical experiments on motion planning benchmarks demonstrate that \textit{STLCCP} can efficiently handle complex scenarios over long horizons, outperforming existing methods.

Title: Artificial Neural Network for Estimation of Physical Parameters of Sea Water using LiDAR Waveforms
Authors: Saad Ahmed Jamal
Abstract: Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) are fast emerging sensors in the field of Earth Observation. It is a remote sensing technology that utilizes laser beams to measure distances and create detailed three-dimensional representations of objects and environments. The potential of Full Waveform LiDAR is much greater than just height estimation and 3D reconstruction only. Overall shape of signal provides important information about properties of water body. However, the shape of FWL is unexplored as most LiDAR software work on point cloud by utilizing the maximum value within the waveform. Existing techniques in the field of LiDAR data analysis include depth estimation through inverse modeling and regression of logarithmic intensity and depth for approximating the attenuation coefficient. However, these methods suffer from limitations in accuracy. Depth estimation through inverse modeling provides only approximate values and does not account for variations in surface properties, while the regression approach for the attenuation coefficient is only able to generalize a value through several data points which lacks precision and may lead to significant errors in estimation. Additionally, there is currently no established modeling method available for predicting bottom reflectance. This research proposed a novel solution based on neural networks for parameter estimation in LIDAR data analysis. By leveraging the power of neural networks, the proposed solution successfully learned the inversion model, was able to do prediction of parameters such as depth, attenuation coefficient, and bottom reflectance. Performance of model was validated by testing it on real LiDAR data. In future, more data availability would enable more accuracy and reliability of such models.

Title: A Hybrid Algorithm for Iterative Adaptation of Feedforward Controllers: an Application on Electromechanical Switches
Authors: Eloy Serrano-Seco (1), Eduardo Moya-Lasheras (1), Edgar Ramirez-Laboreo (1) ((1) Universidad de Zaragoza)
Abstract: Electromechanical switching devices such as relays, solenoid valves, and contactors offer several technical and economic advantages that make them widely used in industry. However, uncontrolled operations result in undesirable impact-related phenomena at the end of the stroke. As a solution, different soft-landing controls have been proposed. Among them, feedforward control with iterative techniques that adapt its parameters is a solution when real-time feedback is not available. However, these techniques typically require a large number of operations to converge or are computationally intensive, which limits a real implementation. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for the iterative adaptation that is able to eventually adapt the search coordinate system and to reduce the search dimensional size in order to accelerate convergence. Moreover, it automatically toggles between a derivative-free and a gradient-based method to balance exploration and exploitation. To demonstrate the high potential of the proposal, each novel part of the algorithm is compared with a state-of-the-art approach via simulation.

Title: Joint semi-supervised and contrastive learning enables domain generalization and multi-domain segmentation
Authors: Alvaro Gomariz, Yusuke Kikuchi, Yun Yvonna Li, Thomas Albrecht, Andreas Maunz, Daniela Ferrara, Huanxiang Lu, Orcun Goksel
Abstract: Despite their effectiveness, current deep learning models face challenges with images coming from different domains with varying appearance and content. We introduce SegCLR, a versatile framework designed to segment images across different domains, employing supervised and contrastive learning simultaneously to effectively learn from both labeled and unlabeled data. We demonstrate the superior performance of SegCLR through a comprehensive evaluation involving three diverse clinical datasets of 3D retinal Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images, for the slice-wise segmentation of fluids with various network configurations and verification across 10 different network initializations. In an unsupervised domain adaptation context, SegCLR achieves results on par with a supervised upper-bound model trained on the intended target domain. Notably, we discover that the segmentation performance of SegCLR framework is marginally impacted by the abundance of unlabeled data from the target domain, thereby we also propose an effective domain generalization extension of SegCLR, known also as zero-shot domain adaptation, which eliminates the need for any target domain information. This shows that our proposed addition of contrastive loss in standard supervised training for segmentation leads to superior models, inherently more generalizable to both in- and out-of-domain test data. We additionally propose a pragmatic solution for SegCLR deployment in realistic scenarios with multiple domains containing labeled data. Accordingly, our framework pushes the boundaries of deep-learning based segmentation in multi-domain applications, regardless of data availability - labeled, unlabeled, or nonexistent.

Title: MmWave for Extended Reality: Open User Mobility Dataset, Characterisation, and Impact on Link Quality
Authors: Alexander Marinsek, Sam De Kunst, Gilles Callebaut, Lieven De Strycker, Liesbet Van der Perre
Abstract: User mobility in extended reality (XR) can have a major impact on millimeter-wave (mmWave) links and may require dedicated mitigation strategies to ensure reliable connections and avoid outage. The available prior art has predominantly focused on XR applications with constrained user mobility and limited impact on mmWave channels. We have performed dedicated experiments to extend the characterisation of relevant future XR use cases featuring a high degree of user mobility. To this end, we have carried out a tailor-made measurement campaign and conducted a characterisation of the collected tracking data, including the approximation of the data using statistical distributions. Moreover, we have provided an interpretation of the possible impact of the recorded mobility on mmWave technology. The dataset is made publicly accessible to provide a testing ground for wireless system design and to enable further XR mobility modelling.

Title: DASS: Distilled Audio State Space Models Are Stronger and More Duration-Scalable Learners
Authors: Saurabhchand Bhati, Yuan Gong, Leonid Karlinsky, Hilde Kuehne, Rogerio Feris, James Glass
Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as an alternative to Transformers for audio modeling due to their high computational efficiency with long inputs. While recent efforts on Audio SSMs have reported encouraging results, two main limitations remain: First, in 10-second short audio tagging tasks, Audio SSMs still underperform compared to Transformer-based models such as Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST). Second, although Audio SSMs theoretically support long audio inputs, their actual performance with long audio has not been thoroughly evaluated. To address these limitations, in this paper, 1) We applied knowledge distillation in audio space model training, resulting in a model called Knowledge Distilled Audio SSM (DASS). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first SSM that outperforms the Transformers on AudioSet and achieves an mAP of 48.9; and 2) We designed a new test called Audio Needle In A Haystack (Audio NIAH). We find that DASS, trained with only 10-second audio clips, can retrieve sound events in audio recordings up to 2.5 hours long, while the AST model fails when the input is just 50 seconds, demonstrating SSMs are indeed more duration scalable.

Title: Towards A Generalizable Pathology Foundation Model via Unified Knowledge Distillation
Authors: Jiabo Ma, Zhengrui Guo, Fengtao Zhou, Yihui Wang, Yingxue Xu, Jinbang Li, Fang Yan, Yu Cai, Zhengjie Zhu, Cheng Jin, Yi Lin, Xinrui Jiang, Chenglong Zhao, Danyi Li, Anjia Han, Zhenhui Li, Ronald Cheong Kin Chan, Jiguang Wang, Peng Fei, Kwang-Ting Cheng, Shaoting Zhang, Li Liang, Hao Chen
Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on large-scale datasets are revolutionizing the field of computational pathology (CPath). The generalization ability of foundation models is crucial for the success in various downstream clinical tasks. However, current foundation models have only been evaluated on a limited type and number of tasks, leaving their generalization ability and overall performance unclear. To address this gap, we established a most comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of off-the-shelf foundation models across six distinct clinical task types, encompassing a total of 72 specific tasks, including slide-level classification, survival prediction, ROI-tissue classification, ROI retrieval, visual question answering, and report generation. Our findings reveal that existing foundation models excel at certain task types but struggle to effectively handle the full breadth of clinical tasks. To improve the generalization of pathology foundation models, we propose a unified knowledge distillation framework consisting of both expert and self-knowledge distillation, where the former allows the model to learn from the knowledge of multiple expert models, while the latter leverages self-distillation to enable image representation learning via local-global alignment. Based on this framework, we curated a dataset of 96,000 whole slide images (WSIs) and developed a Generalizable Pathology Foundation Model (GPFM). This advanced model was trained on a substantial dataset comprising 190 million images extracted from approximately 72,000 publicly available slides, encompassing 34 major tissue types. Evaluated on the established benchmark, GPFM achieves an impressive average rank of 1.6, with 42 tasks ranked 1st, while the second-best model, UNI, attains an average rank of 3.7, with only 6 tasks ranked 1st.

Title: LEAD: Towards Learning-Based Equity-Aware Decarbonization in Ridesharing Platforms
Authors: Mahsa Sahebdel, Ali Zeynali, Noman Bashir, Prashant Shenoy, Mohammad Hajiesmaili
Abstract: Ridesharing platforms such as Uber, Lyft, and DiDi have grown in popularity due to their on-demand availability, ease of use, and commute cost reductions, among other benefits. However, not all ridesharing promises have panned out. Recent studies demonstrate that the expected drop in traffic congestion and reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have not materialized. This is primarily due to the substantial distances traveled by the ridesharing vehicles without passengers between rides, known as deadhead miles. Recent work has focused on reducing the impact of deadhead miles while considering additional metrics such as rider waiting time, GHG emissions from deadhead miles, or driver earnings. However, most prior studies consider these environmental and equity-based metrics individually despite them being interrelated. In this paper, we propose a Learning-based Equity-Aware Decarabonization approach, LEAD, for ridesharing platforms. LEAD targets minimizing emissions while ensuring that the driver's utility, defined as the difference between the trip distance and the deadhead miles, is fairly distributed. LEAD uses reinforcement learning to match riders with drivers based on the expected future utility of drivers and the expected carbon emissions of the platform without increasing the rider waiting times. Extensive experiments based on a real-world ridesharing dataset show that LEAD improves the defined notion of fairness by 150% when compared to emission-aware ride-assignment and reduces emissions by 14.6% while ensuring fairness within 28--52% of the fairness-focused baseline. It also reduces the rider wait time, by at least 32.1%, compared to a fairness-focused baseline.

Title: FLAMO: An Open-Source Library for Frequency-Domain Differentiable Audio Processing
Authors: Gloria Dal Santo, Gian Marco De Bortoli, Karolina Prawda, Sebastian J. Schlecht, Vesa Välimäki
Abstract: We present FLAMO, a Frequency-sampling Library for Audio-Module Optimization designed to implement and optimize differentiable linear time-invariant audio systems. The library is open-source and built on the frequency-sampling filter design method, allowing for the creation of differentiable modules that can be used stand-alone or within the computation graph of neural networks, simplifying the development of differentiable audio systems. It includes predefined filtering modules and auxiliary classes for constructing, training, and logging the optimized systems, all accessible through an intuitive interface. Practical application of these modules is demonstrated through two case studies: the optimization of an artificial reverberator and an active acoustics system for improved response coloration.

Title: Integrating Reinforcement Learning and Model Predictive Control with Applications to Microgrids
Authors: Caio Fabio Oliveira da Silva, Azita Dabiri, Bart De Schutter
Abstract: This work proposes an approach that integrates reinforcement learning and model predictive control (MPC) to solve finite-horizon optimal control problems in mixed-logical dynamical systems efficiently. Optimization-based control of such systems with discrete and continuous decision variables entails the online solution of mixed-integer linear programs, which suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Our approach aims to mitigate this issue by decoupling the decision on the discrete variables from the decision on the continuous variables. In the proposed approach, reinforcement learning determines the discrete decision variables and simplifies the online optimization problem of the MPC controller from a mixed-integer linear program to a linear program, significantly reducing the computational time. A fundamental contribution of this work is the definition of the decoupled Q-function, which plays a crucial role in making the learning problem tractable in a combinatorial action space. We motivate the use of recurrent neural networks to approximate the decoupled Q-function and show how they can be employed in a reinforcement learning setting. Simulation experiments on a microgrid system using real-world data demonstrate that the proposed method substantially reduces the online computation time of MPC while maintaining high feasibility and low suboptimality.

Title: EEG-based Decoding of Selective Visual Attention in Superimposed Videos
Authors: Yuanyuan Yao, Wout De Swaef, Simon Geirnaert, Alexander Bertrand
Abstract: Selective attention enables humans to efficiently process visual stimuli by enhancing important elements and filtering out irrelevant information. Locating visual attention is fundamental in neuroscience with potential applications in brain-computer interfaces. Conventional paradigms often use synthetic stimuli or static images, but visual stimuli in real life contain smooth and highly irregular dynamics. We show that these irregular dynamics can be decoded from electroencephalography (EEG) signals for selective visual attention decoding. To this end, we propose a free-viewing paradigm in which participants attend to one of two superimposed videos, each showing a center-aligned person performing a stage act. Superimposing ensures that the relative differences in the neural responses are not driven by differences in object locations. A stimulus-informed decoder is trained to extract EEG components correlated with the motion patterns of the attended object, and can detect the attended object in unseen data with significantly above-chance accuracy. This shows that the EEG responses to naturalistic motion are modulated by selective attention. Eye movements are also found to be correlated to the motion patterns in the attended video, despite the spatial overlap with the distractor. We further show that these eye movements do not dominantly drive the EEG-based decoding and that complementary information exists in EEG and gaze data. Moreover, our results indicate that EEG may also capture neural responses to unattended objects. To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore EEG-based selective visual attention decoding on natural videos, opening new possibilities for experiment design.

Title: Language-based Audio Moment Retrieval
Authors: Hokuto Munakata, Taichi Nishimura, Shota Nakada, Tatsuya Komatsu
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and design a new task called audio moment retrieval (AMR). Unlike conventional language-based audio retrieval tasks that search for short audio clips from an audio database, AMR aims to predict relevant moments in untrimmed long audio based on a text query. Given the lack of prior work in AMR, we first build a dedicated dataset, Clotho-Moment, consisting of large-scale simulated audio recordings with moment annotations. We then propose a DETR-based model, named Audio Moment DETR (AM-DETR), as a fundamental framework for AMR tasks. This model captures temporal dependencies within audio features, inspired by similar video moment retrieval tasks, thus surpassing conventional clip-level audio retrieval methods. Additionally, we provide manually annotated datasets to properly measure the effectiveness and robustness of our methods on real data. Experimental results show that AM-DETR, trained with Clotho-Moment, outperforms a baseline model that applies a clip-level audio retrieval method with a sliding window on all metrics, particularly improving Recall1@0.7 by 9.00 points. Our datasets and code are publicly available in this https URL.

Title: Calculation of time-optimal motion primitives for systems exhibiting oscillatory internal dynamics
Authors: Thomas Auer, Frank Woittennek
Abstract: An algorithm for planning near time-optimal trajectories for systems with an oscillatory internal dynamics has been developed in previous work. It is based on assembling a complete trajectory from motion primitives called jerk segments, which are the time-optimal solution to an optimization problem. To achieve the shortest overall transition time, it is advantageous to recompute these segments for different acceleration levels within the motion planning procedure. This publication presents a numerical calculation method enabling fast and reliable calculation. This is achieved by explicitly evaluating the optimality conditions that arise for the problem, and further by reducing the evaluation of these conditions to a line-search problem on a bounded interval. This reduction guarantees, that a valid solution if found after a fixed number of computational steps, making the calculation time constant and predictable. Furthermore, the algorithm does not rely on optimisation algorithms, which allowed its implementation on a laboratory system for measurements with the purpose of validating the approach.

Title: Secure Filtering against Spatio-Temporal False Data Attacks under Asynchronous Sampling
Authors: Zishuo Li, Anh Tung Nguyen, André M. H. Teixeira, Yilin Mo, Karl H. Johansson
Abstract: This paper addresses the secure state estimation problem for continuous linear time-invariant systems with non-periodic and asynchronous sampled measurements, where the sensors need to transmit not only measurements but also sampling time-stamps to the fusion center. This measurement and communication setup is well-suited for operating large-scale control systems and, at the same time, introduces new vulnerabilities that can be exploited by adversaries through (i) manipulation of measurements, (ii) manipulation of time-stamps, (iii) elimination of measurements, (iv) generation of completely new false measurements, or a combination of these attacks. To mitigate these attacks, we propose a decentralized estimation algorithm in which each sensor maintains its local state estimate asynchronously based on its measurements. The local states are synchronized through time prediction and fused after time-stamp alignment. In the absence of attacks, state estimates are proven to recover the optimal Kalman estimates by solving a weighted least square problem. In the presence of attacks, solving this weighted least square problem with the aid of $\ell_1$ regularization provides secure state estimates with uniformly bounded error under an observability redundancy assumption. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated using a benchmark example of the IEEE 14-bus system.

Title: CAPA: Continuous-Aperture Arrays for Revolutionizing 6G Wireless Communications
Authors: Yuanwei Liu, Chongjun Ouyang, Zhaolin Wang, Jiaqi Xu, Xidong Mu, Zhiguo Ding
Abstract: In this paper, a novel continuous-aperture array (CAPA)-based wireless communication architecture is proposed, which relies on an electrically large aperture with a continuous current distribution. First, an existing prototype of CAPA is reviewed, followed by the potential benefits and key motivations for employing CAPAs in wireless communications. Then, three practical hardware implementation approaches for CAPAs are introduced based on electronic, optical, and acoustic materials. Furthermore, several beamforming approaches are proposed to optimize the continuous current distributions of CAPAs, which are fundamentally different from those used for conventional spatially discrete arrays (SPDAs). Numerical results are provided to demonstrate their key features in low complexity and near-optimality. Based on these proposed approaches, the performance gains of CAPAs over SPDAs are revealed in terms of channel capacity as well as diversity-multiplexing gains. Finally, several open research problems in CAPA are highlighted.

Title: A Tensor-Structured Approach to Dynamic Channel Prediction for Massive MIMO Systems with Temporal Non-Stationarity
Authors: Hongwei Hou, Yafei Wang, Yiming Zhu, Xinping Yi, Wenjin Wang, Dirk T. M. Slock, Shi Jin
Abstract: In moderate- to high-mobility scenarios, CSI varies rapidly and becomes temporally non-stationary, leading to severe performance degradation in the massive MIMO transmissions. To address this issue, we propose a tensor-structured approach to dynamic channel prediction (TS-DCP) for massive MIMO systems with temporal non-stationarity, exploiting both dual-timescale and cross-domain correlations. Specifically, due to inherent spatial consistency, non-stationary channels over long-timescales can be approximated as stationary on short-timescales, decoupling complicated temporal correlations into more tractable dual-timescale ones. To exploit such property, we propose the sliding frame structure composed of multiple pilot OFDM symbols, which capture short-timescale correlations within frames by Doppler domain modeling and long-timescale correlations across frames by Markov/autoregressive processes. Building on this, we develop the Tucker-based spatial-frequency-temporal domain channel model, incorporating angle-delay-Doppler (ADD) domain channels and factor matrices parameterized by ADD domain grids. Furthermore, we model cross-domain correlations of ADD domain channels within each frame, induced by clustered scattering, through the Markov random field and tensor-coupled Gaussian distribution that incorporates high-order neighboring structures. Following these probabilistic models, we formulate the TS-DCP problem as variational free energy (VFE) minimization, and unify different inference rules through the structure design of trial beliefs. This formulation results in the dual-layer VFE optimization process and yields the online TS-DCP algorithm, where the computational complexity is reduced by exploiting tensor-structured operations. Numerical simulations demonstrate the significant superiority of the proposed algorithm over benchmarks in terms of channel prediction performance.

Title: CBraMod: A Criss-Cross Brain Foundation Model for EEG Decoding
Authors: Jiquan Wang, Sha Zhao, Zhiling Luo, Yangxuan Zhou, Haiteng Jiang, Shijian Li, Tao Li, Gang Pan
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique to measure and record brain electrical activity, widely used in various BCI and healthcare applications. Early EEG decoding methods rely on supervised learning, limited by specific tasks and datasets, hindering model performance and generalizability. With the success of large language models, there is a growing body of studies focusing on EEG foundation models. However, these studies still leave challenges: Firstly, most of existing EEG foundation models employ full EEG modeling strategy. It models the spatial and temporal dependencies between all EEG patches together, but ignores that the spatial and temporal dependencies are heterogeneous due to the unique structural characteristics of EEG signals. Secondly, existing EEG foundation models have limited generalizability on a wide range of downstream BCI tasks due to varying formats of EEG data, making it challenging to adapt to. To address these challenges, we propose a novel foundation model called CBraMod. Specifically, we devise a criss-cross transformer as the backbone to thoroughly leverage the structural characteristics of EEG signals, which can model spatial and temporal dependencies separately through two parallel attention mechanisms. And we utilize an asymmetric conditional positional encoding scheme which can encode positional information of EEG patches and be easily adapted to the EEG with diverse formats. CBraMod is pre-trained on a very large corpus of EEG through patch-based masked EEG reconstruction. We evaluate CBraMod on up to 10 downstream BCI tasks (12 public datasets). CBraMod achieves the state-of-the-art performance across the wide range of tasks, proving its strong capability and generalizability. The source code is publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Ultra-Low Complexity On-Orbit Compression for Remote Sensing Imagery via Block Modulated Imaging
Authors: Zhibin Wang, Yanxin Cai, Jiayi Zhou, Yangming Zhang, Tianyu Li, Wei Li, Xun Liu, Guoqing Wang, Yang Yang
Abstract: The growing field of remote sensing faces a challenge: the ever-increasing size and volume of imagery data are exceeding the storage and transmission capabilities of satellite platforms. Efficient compression of remote sensing imagery is a critical solution to alleviate these burdens on satellites. However, existing compression methods are often too computationally expensive for satellites. With the continued advancement of compressed sensing theory, single-pixel imaging emerges as a powerful tool that brings new possibilities for on-orbit image compression. However, it still suffers from prolonged imaging times and the inability to perform high-resolution imaging, hindering its practical application. This paper advances the study of compressed sensing in remote sensing image compression, proposing Block Modulated Imaging (BMI). By requiring only a single exposure, BMI significantly enhances imaging acquisition speeds. Additionally, BMI obviates the need for digital micromirror devices and surpasses limitations in image resolution. Furthermore, we propose a novel decoding network specifically designed to reconstruct images compressed under the BMI framework. Leveraging the gated 3D convolutions and promoting efficient information flow across stages through a Two-Way Cross-Attention module, our decoding network exhibits demonstrably superior reconstruction performance. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple renowned remote sensing datasets unequivocally demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. To further validate its practical applicability, we developed and tested a prototype of the BMI-based camera, which has shown promising potential for on-orbit image compression.

Title: Array Gain for Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)
Authors: Chongjun Ouyang, Zhaolin Wang, Yuanwei Liu, Zhiguo Ding
Abstract: Pinching antennas is a novel flexible-antenna technology, which can be realized by employing small dielectric particles on a waveguide. The aim of this letter is to characterize the array gain achieved by pinching-antenna systems (PASS). A closed-form upper bound on the array gain is derived by fixing the inter-antenna spacing. Asymptotic analyses of this bound are conducted by considering an infinitely large number of antennas, demonstrating the existence of an optimal number of antennas that maximizes the array gain. To approach this bound, an antenna position refinement method is introduced. The relationship between the array gain and inter-antenna spacing is further explored by incorporating the effect of mutual coupling. It is proven that there also exists an optimal inter-antenna spacing that maximizes the array gain. Numerical results demonstrate that by optimizing the number of antennas and inter-antenna spacing, PASS can achieve a significantly larger array gain than conventional-antenna systems.

Title: Distributed Prescribed-Time Observer for Nonlinear Systems in Block-Triangular Form
Authors: Vincent de Heij, M. Umar B. Niazi, Karl H. Johansson, Saeed Ahmed
Abstract: This paper proposes a distributed prescribed-time observer for nonlinear systems representable in a block-triangular observable canonical form. Using a weighted average of neighbor estimates exchanged over a strongly connected digraph, each observer estimates the system state despite the limited observability of local sensor measurements. The proposed design guarantees that distributed state estimation errors converge to zero at a user-specified convergence time, irrespective of observers' initial conditions. To achieve this prescribed-time convergence, distributed observers implement time-varying local output injection gains that monotonically increase and approach infinity at the prescribed time. The theoretical convergence is rigorously proven and validated through numerical simulations, where some implementation issues due to increasing gains have also been clarified.

Title: Machine learning-based hybrid dynamic modeling and economic predictive control of carbon capture process for ship decarbonization
Authors: Xuewen Zhang, Kuniadi Wandy Huang, Dat-Nguyen Vo, Minghao Han, Benjamin Decardi-Nelson, Xunyuan Yin
Abstract: Implementing carbon capture technology on-board ships holds promise as a solution to facilitate the reduction of carbon intensity in international shipping, as mandated by the International Maritime Organization. In this work, we address the energy-efficient operation of shipboard carbon capture processes by proposing a hybrid modeling-based economic predictive control scheme. Specifically, we consider a comprehensive shipboard carbon capture process that encompasses the ship engine system and the shipboard post-combustion carbon capture plant. To accurately and robustly characterize the dynamic behaviors of this shipboard plant, we develop a hybrid dynamic process model that integrates available imperfect physical knowledge with neural networks trained using process operation data. An economic model predictive control approach is proposed based on the hybrid model to ensure carbon capture efficiency while minimizing energy consumption required for the carbon capture process operation. The cross-entropy method is employed to efficiently solve the complex non-convex optimization problem associated with the proposed hybrid model-based economic model predictive control method. Extensive simulations, analyses, and comparisons are conducted to verify the effectiveness and illustrate the superiority of the proposed framework.

Title: Cross-Domain Continual Learning for Edge Intelligence in Wireless ISAC Networks
Authors: Jingzhi Hu, Xin Li, Zhou Su, Jun Luo
Abstract: In wireless networks with integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), edge intelligence (EI) is expected to be developed at edge devices (ED) for sensing user activities based on channel state information (CSI). However, due to the CSI being highly specific to users' characteristics, the CSI-activity relationship is notoriously domain dependent, essentially demanding EI to learn sufficient datasets from various domains in order to gain cross-domain sensing capability. This poses a crucial challenge owing to the EDs' limited resources, for which storing datasets across all domains will be a significant burden. In this paper, we propose the EdgeCL framework, enabling the EI to continually learn-then-discard each incoming dataset, while remaining resilient to catastrophic forgetting. We design a transformer-based discriminator for handling sequences of noisy and nonequispaced CSI samples. Besides, we propose a distilled core-set based knowledge retention method with robustness-enhanced optimization to train the discriminator, preserving its performance for previous domains while preventing future forgetting.

Title: Sparse Spectrahedral Shadows for State Estimation and Reachability Analysis: Set Operations, Validations and Order Reductions
Authors: Chengrui Wang, Haohao Qiu, Sibo Yao, James Lam
Abstract: Set representations are the foundation of various set-based approaches in state estimation, reachability analysis and fault diagnosis. In this paper, we investigate spectrahedral shadows, a class of nonlinear geometric objects previously studied in semidefinite programming and real algebraic geometry. We demonstrate spectrahedral shadows generalize traditional and emerging set representations like ellipsoids, zonotopes, constrained zonotopes and ellipsotopes. Analytical forms of set operations are provided including linear map, linear inverse map, Minkowski sum, intersection, Cartesian product, Minkowski-Firey Lp sum, convex hull, conic hull and polytopic map, all of which are implemented without approximation in polynomial time. In addition, we develop set validation and order reduction techniques for spectrahedral shadows, thereby establishing spectrahedral shadows as a set representation applicable to a range of set-based tasks.

Title: Multi-modal Contrastive Learning for Tumor-specific Missing Modality Synthesis
Authors: Minjoo Lim, Bogyeong Kang, Tae-Eui Kam
Abstract: Multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for providing complementary information about brain anatomy and pathology, leading to more accurate diagnoses. However, obtaining high-quality multi-modal MRI in a clinical setting is difficult due to factors such as time constraints, high costs, and patient movement artifacts. To overcome this difficulty, there is increasing interest in developing generative models that can synthesize missing target modality images from the available source ones. Therefore, our team, PLAVE, design a generative model for missing MRI that integrates multi-modal contrastive learning with a focus on critical tumor regions. Specifically, we integrate multi-modal contrastive learning, tailored for multiple source modalities, and enhance its effectiveness by selecting features based on entropy during the contrastive learning process. Additionally, our network not only generates the missing target modality images but also predicts segmentation outputs, simultaneously. This approach improves the generator's capability to precisely generate tumor regions, ultimately improving performance in downstream segmentation tasks. By leveraging a combination of contrastive, segmentation, and additional self-representation losses, our model effectively reflects target-specific information and generate high-quality target images. Consequently, our results in the Brain MR Image Synthesis challenge demonstrate that the proposed model excelled in generating the missing modality.

Title: Velocity-free task-space regulator for robot manipulators with external disturbances
Authors: Haiwen Wu, Bayu Jayawardhana, Dabo Xu
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of task-space robust regulation of robot manipulators subject to external disturbances. A velocity-free control law is proposed by combining the internal model principle and the passivity-based output-feedback control approach. The resulting controller not only ensures asymptotic convergence of the regulation error but also rejects unwanted external sinusoidal disturbances. The potential of the proposed method lies in its simplicity, intuitiveness, and straightforward gain selection criteria for the synthesis of multi-joint robot manipulator control systems.

Title: Opportunistic Routing in Wireless Communications via Learnable State-Augmented Policies
Authors: Sourajit Das, Kirtan Gopal Panda, Navid NaderiAlizadeh
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of packet-based information routing in large-scale wireless communication networks. The problem is framed as a constrained statistical learning task, where each network node operates using only local information. Opportunistic routing exploits the broadcast nature of wireless communication to dynamically select optimal forwarding nodes, enabling the information to reach the destination through multiple relay nodes simultaneously. To solve this, we propose a State-Augmentation (SA) based distributed optimization approach aimed at maximizing the total information handled by the source nodes in the network. The problem formulation leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which perform graph convolutions based on the topological connections between network nodes. Using an unsupervised learning paradigm, we extract routing policies from the GNN architecture, enabling optimal decisions for source nodes across various flows. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance when training a GNN-parameterized model, particularly when compared to baseline algorithms. Additionally, applying the method to real-world network topologies and wireless ad-hoc network test beds validates its effectiveness, highlighting the robustness and transferability of GNNs.

Title: Reconstruct Anything Model: a lightweight foundation model for computational imaging
Authors: Matthieu Terris, Samuel Hurault, Maxime Song, Julian Tachella
Abstract: Most existing learning-based methods for solving imaging inverse problems can be roughly divided into two classes: iterative algorithms, such as plug-and-play and diffusion methods, that leverage pretrained denoisers, and unrolled architectures that are trained end-to-end for specific imaging problems. Iterative methods in the first class are computationally costly and often provide suboptimal reconstruction performance, whereas unrolled architectures are generally specific to a single inverse problem and require expensive training. In this work, we propose a novel non-iterative, lightweight architecture that incorporates knowledge about the forward operator (acquisition physics and noise parameters) without relying on unrolling. Our model is trained to solve a wide range of inverse problems beyond denoising, including deblurring, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, inpainting, and super-resolution. The proposed model can be easily adapted to unseen inverse problems or datasets with a few fine-tuning steps (up to a few images) in a self-supervised way, without ground-truth references. Throughout a series of experiments, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance from medical imaging to low-photon imaging and microscopy.

Title: Accurate Control under Voltage Drop for Rotor Drones
Authors: Yuhang Liu, Jindou Jia, Zihan Yang, Kexin Guo
Abstract: This letter proposes an anti-disturbance control scheme for rotor drones to counteract voltage drop (VD) disturbance caused by voltage drop of the battery, which is a common case for long-time flight or aggressive maneuvers. Firstly, the refined dynamics of rotor drones considering VD disturbance are presented. Based on the dynamics, a voltage drop observer (VDO) is developed to accurately estimate the VD disturbance by decoupling the disturbance and state information of the drone, reducing the conservativeness of conventional disturbance observers. Subsequently, the control scheme integrates the VDO within the translational loop and a fixed-time sliding mode observer (SMO) within the rotational loop, enabling it to address force and torque disturbances caused by voltage drop of the battery. Sufficient real flight experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme under VD disturbance.

Title: Zero-Shot Denoising for Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy with Intensity-Guided Learning
Authors: Hao Chen, Julian Najera, Dagmawit Geresu, Meenal Datta, Cody Smith, Scott Howard
Abstract: Multimodal and multi-information microscopy techniques such as Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) extend the informational channels beyond intensity-based fluorescence microscopy but suffer from reduced image quality due to complex noise patterns. For FLIM, the intrinsic relationship between intensity and lifetime information means noise in each channel is a multivariate function across channels without necessarily sharing structural features. Based on this, we present a novel Zero-Shot Denoising Framework with an Intensity-Guided Learning approach. Our correlation-preserving strategy maintains important biological information that might be lost when channels are processed independently. Our framework implements separate processing paths for each channel and utilizes a pre-trained intensity denoising prior to guide the refinement of lifetime components across multiple channels. Through experiments on real-world FLIM-acquired biological samples, we show that our approach outperforms existing methods in both noise reduction and lifetime preservation, thereby enabling more reliable extraction of physiological and molecular information.

Title: Stability and Controllability of Revenue Systems via the Bode Approach
Authors: Yichuan Niu, Jianhui Chen
Abstract: In online revenue systems, e.g. an advertising system, budget pacing plays a critical role in ensuring that the spend aligns with desired financial objectives. Pacing systems dynamically control the velocity of spending to balance auction intensity, traffic fluctuations, and other stochastic variables. Current industry practices rely heavily on trial-and-error approaches, often leading to inefficiencies and instability. This paper introduces a principled methodology rooted in Classical Control Theory to address these challenges. By modeling the pacing system as a linear time-invariant (LTI) proxy and leveraging compensator design techniques using Bode methodology, we derive a robust controller to minimize pacing errors and enhance stability. The proposed methodology is validated through simulation and tested by our in-house auction system, demonstrating superior performance in achieving precise budget allocation while maintaining resilience to traffic and auction dynamics. Our findings bridge the gap between traditional control theory and modern advertising systems in modeling, simulation, and validation, offering a scalable and systematic approach to budget pacing optimization.

Title: Data-Driven Safety Verification using Barrier Certificates and Matrix Zonotopes
Authors: Mohammed Adib Oumer, Amr Alanwar, Majid Zamani
Abstract: Ensuring safety in cyber-physical systems (CPSs) is a critical challenge, especially when system models are difficult to obtain or cannot be fully trusted due to uncertainty, modeling errors, or environmental disturbances. Traditional model-based approaches rely on precise system dynamics, which may not be available in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose a data-driven safety verification framework that leverages matrix zonotopes and barrier certificates to verify system safety directly from noisy data. Instead of trusting a single unreliable model, we construct a set of models that capture all possible system dynamics that align with the observed data, ensuring that the true system model is always contained within this set. This model set is compactly represented using matrix zonotopes, enabling efficient computation and propagation of uncertainty. By integrating this representation into a barrier certificate framework, we establish rigorous safety guarantees without requiring an explicit system model. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in verifying safety for dynamical systems with unknown models, showcasing its potential for real-world CPS applications.

Title: Utilizing 5G NR SSB Blocks for Passive Detection and Localization of Low-Altitude Drones
Authors: Palatip Jopanya, Diana P. M. Osorio
Abstract: With the exponential growth of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) industry and a broad range of applications expected to appear in the coming years, the employment of traditional radar systems is becoming increasingly cumbersome for UAV supervision. Motivated by this emerging challenge, this paper investigates the feasibility of employing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems implemented over current and future wireless networks to perform this task. We propose a sensing mechanism based on the synchronization signal block (SSB) in the fifth-generation (5G) standard that performs sensing in a passive bistatic setting. By assuming planar arrays at the sensing nodes and according to the 5G standard, we consider that the SSB signal is sent in a grid of orthogonal beams that are multiplexed in time, with some of them pointing toward a surveillance region where low-altitude drones can be flying. The Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) is derived as the theoretical bound for range and velocity estimation. Our results demonstrate the potential of employing SSB signals for UAV-like target localization at low SNR.

Title: WaveNet-Volterra Neural Networks for Active Noise Control: A Fully Causal Approach
Authors: Lu Bai, Mengtong Li, Siyuan Lian, Kai Chen, Jing Lu
Abstract: Active Noise Control (ANC) systems are challenged by nonlinear distortions, which degrade the performance of traditional adaptive filters. While deep learning-based ANC algorithms have emerged to address nonlinearity, existing approaches often overlook critical limitations: (1) end-to-end Deep Neural Network (DNN) models frequently violate causality constraints inherent to real-time ANC applications; (2) many studies compare DNN-based methods against simplified or low-order adaptive filters rather than fully optimized high-order counterparts. In this letter, we propose a causality-preserving time-domain ANC framework that synergizes WaveNet with Volterra Neural Networks (VNNs), explicitly addressing system nonlinearity while ensuring strict causal operation. Unlike prior DNN-based approaches, our method is benchmarked against both state-of-the-art deep learning architectures and rigorously optimized high-order adaptive filters, including Wiener solutions. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance over existing DNN methods and traditional algorithms, revealing that prior claims of DNN superiority stem from incomplete comparisons with suboptimal traditional baselines.

Title: Probabilistic Position-Aided Beam Selection for mmWave MIMO Systems
Authors: Joseph K. Chege, Arie Yeredor, Martin Haardt
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems rely on highly directional beamforming to overcome severe path loss and ensure robust communication links. However, selecting the optimal beam pair efficiently remains a challenge due to the large search space and the overhead of conventional methods. This paper proposes a probabilistic position-aided beam selection approach that exploits the statistical dependence between user equipment (UE) positions and optimal beam indices. We model the underlying joint probability mass function (PMF) of the positions and the beam indices as a low-rank tensor and estimate its parameters from training data using Bayesian inference. The estimated model is then used to predict the best (or a list of the top) beam pair indices for new UE positions. The proposed method is evaluated using data generated from a state-of-the-art ray tracing simulator and compared with neural network-based and fingerprinting approaches. The results show that our approach achieves a high data rate with fewer training samples and a significantly reduced beam search space. These advantages render it a promising solution for practical mmWave MIMO deployments, reducing the beam search overhead while maintaining a reliable connectivity.

Title: InstructMPC: A Human-LLM-in-the-Loop Framework for Context-Aware Control
Authors: Ruixiang Wu, Jiahao Ai, Tongxin Li
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful control strategy widely utilized in domains like energy management, building control, and autonomous systems. However, its effectiveness in real-world settings is challenged by the need to incorporate context-specific predictions and expert instructions, which traditional MPC often neglects. We propose InstructMPC, a novel framework that addresses this gap by integrating real-time human instructions through a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce context-aware predictions for MPC. Our method employs a Language-to-Distribution (L2D) module to translate contextual information into predictive disturbance trajectories, which are then incorporated into the MPC optimization. Unlike existing context-aware and language-based MPC models, InstructMPC enables dynamic human-LLM interaction and fine-tunes the L2D module in a closed loop with theoretical performance guarantees, achieving a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T\log T})$ for linear dynamics when optimized via advanced fine-tuning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using a tailored loss function.

Title: Deep Neural Koopman Operator-based Economic Model Predictive Control of Shipboard Carbon Capture System
Authors: Minghao Han, Xunyuan Yin
Abstract: Shipboard carbon capture is a promising solution to help reduce carbon emissions in international shipping. In this work, we propose a data-driven dynamic modeling and economic predictive control approach within the Koopman framework. This integrated modeling and control approach is used to achieve safe and energy-efficient process operation of shipboard post-combustion carbon capture plants. Specifically, we propose a deep neural Koopman operator modeling approach, based on which a Koopman model with time-varying model parameters is established. This Koopman model predicts the overall economic operational cost and key system outputs, based on accessible partial state measurements. By leveraging this learned model, a constrained economic predictive control scheme is developed. Despite time-varying parameters involved in the formulated model, the formulated optimization problem associated with the economic predictive control design is convex, and it can be solved efficiently during online control implementations. Extensive tests are conducted on a high-fidelity simulation environment for shipboard post-combustion carbon capture processes. Four ship operational conditions are taken into account. The results show that the proposed method significantly improves the overall economic operational performance and carbon capture rate. Additionally, the proposed method guarantees safe operation by ensuring that hard constraints on the system outputs are satisfied.

Title: Filtering through a topological lens: homology for point processes on the time-frequency plane
Authors: Juan Manuel Miramont, Kin Aun Tan, Soumendu Sundar Mukherjee, Rémi Bardenet, Subhroshekhar Ghosh
Abstract: We introduce a very general approach to the analysis of signals from their noisy measurements from the perspective of Topological Data Analysis (TDA). While TDA has emerged as a powerful analytical tool for data with pronounced topological structures, here we demonstrate its applicability for general problems of signal processing, without any a-priori geometric feature. Our methods are well-suited to a wide array of time-dependent signals in different scientific domains, with acoustic signals being a particularly important application. We invoke time-frequency representations of such signals, focusing on their zeros which are gaining salience as a signal processing tool in view of their stability properties. Leveraging state-of-the-art topological concepts, such as stable and minimal volumes, we develop a complete suite of TDA-based methods to explore the delicate stochastic geometry of these zeros, capturing signals based on the disruption they cause to this rigid, hyperuniform spatial structure. Unlike classical spatial data tools, TDA is able to capture the full spectrum of the stochastic geometry of the zeros, thereby leading to powerful inferential outcomes that are underpinned by a principled statistical foundation. This is reflected in the power and versatility of our applications, which include competitive performance in processing. a wide variety of audio signals (esp. in low SNR regimes), effective detection and reconstruction of gravitational wave signals (a reputed signal processing challenge with non-Gaussian noise), and medical time series data from EEGs, indicating a wide horizon for the approach and methods introduced in this paper.

Title: Towards Simple Machine Learning Baselines for GNSS RFI Detection
Authors: Viktor Ivanov, Richard C. Wilson, Maurizio Scaramuzza
Abstract: Machine learning research in GNSS radio frequency interference (RFI) detection often lacks a clear empirical justification for the choice of deep learning architectures over simpler machine learning approaches. In this work, we argue for a change in research direction-from developing ever more complex deep learning models to carefully assessing their real-world effectiveness in comparison to interpretable and lightweight machine learning baselines. Our findings reveal that state-of-the-art deep learning models frequently fail to outperform simple, well-engineered machine learning methods in the context of GNSS RFI detection. Leveraging a unique large-scale dataset collected by the Swiss Air Force and Swiss Air-Rescue (Rega), and preprocessed by Swiss Air Navigation Services Ltd. (Skyguide), we demonstrate that a simple baseline model achieves 91\% accuracy in detecting GNSS RFI, outperforming more complex deep learning counterparts. These results highlight the effectiveness of pragmatic solutions and offer valuable insights to guide future research in this critical application domain.

Title: Secondary Safety Control for Systems with Sector Bounded Nonlinearities [Extended Version]
Authors: Yankai Lin, Michelle S. Chong, Carlos Murguia
Abstract: We consider the problem of safety verification and safety-aware controller synthesis for systems with sector bounded nonlinearities. We aim to keep the states of the system within a given safe set under potential actuator and sensor attacks. Specifically, we adopt the setup that a controller has already been designed to stabilize the plant. Using invariant sets and barrier certificate theory, we first give sufficient conditions to verify the safety of the closed-loop system under attacks. Furthermore, by using a subset of sensors that are assumed to be free of attacks, we provide a synthesis method for a secondary controller that enhances the safety of the system. The sufficient conditions to verify safety are derived using Lyapunov-based tools and the S-procedure. Using the projection lemma, the conditions are then formulated as linear matrix inequality (LMI) problems which can be solved efficiently. Lastly, our theoretical results are illustrated through numerical simulations.

Title: Delay Violation Probability and Effective Rate of Downlink NOMA over $α$-$μ$ Fading Channels
Authors: Vaibhav Kumar, Barry Cardiff, Shankar Prakriya, Mark F. Flanagan
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a potential candidate to further enhance the spectrum utilization efficiency in beyond fifth-generation (B5G) standards. However, there has been little attention on the quantification of the delay-limited performance of downlink NOMA systems. In this paper, we analyze the performance of a two-user downlink NOMA system over generalized {\alpha}-{\mu} fading in terms of delay violation probability (DVP) and effective rate (ER). In particular, we derive an analytical expression for an upper bound on the DVP and we derive the exact sum ER of the downlink NOMA system. We also derive analytical expressions for high and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) approximations to the sum ER, as well as a fundamental upper bound on the sum ER which represents the ergodic sum-rate for the downlink NOMA system. We also analyze the sum ER of a corresponding time-division-multiplexed orthogonal multiple access (OMA) system. Our results show that while NOMA consistently outperforms OMA over the practical SNR range, the relative gain becomes smaller in more severe fading conditions, and is also smaller in the presence a more strict delay quality-of-service (QoS) constraint.

Title: Seismic Facies Analysis: A Deep Domain Adaptation Approach
Authors: M Quamer Nasim, Tannistha Maiti, Ayush Srivastava, Tarry Singh, Jie Mei
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) can learn accurately from large quantities of labeled input data, but often fail to do so when labelled data are scarce. DNNs sometimes fail to generalize ontest data sampled from different input distributions. Unsupervised Deep Domain Adaptation (DDA)techniques have been proven useful when no labels are available, and when distribution shifts are observed in the target domain (TD). In the present study, experiments are performed on seismic images of the F3 block 3D dataset from offshore Netherlands (source domain; SD) and Penobscot 3D survey data from Canada (target domain; TD). Three geological classes from SD and TD that have similar reflection patterns are considered. A deep neural network architecture named EarthAdaptNet (EAN) is proposed to semantically segment the seismic images when few classes have data scarcity, and we use a transposed residual unit to replace the traditional dilated convolution in the decoder block. The EAN achieved a pixel-level accuracy >84% and an accuracy of ~70% for the minority classes, showing improved performance compared to existing architectures. In addition, we introduce the CORAL (Correlation Alignment) method to the EAN to create an unsupervised deep domain adaptation network (EAN-DDA) for the classification of seismic reflections from F3 and Penobscot, to demonstrate possible approaches when labelled data are unavailable. Maximum class accuracy achieved was ~99% for class 2 of Penobscot, with an overall accuracy>50%. Taken together, the EAN-DDA has the potential to classify target domain seismic facies classes with high accuracy.

Abstract: We consider policy gradient methods for stochastic optimal control problem in continuous time. In particular, we analyze the gradient flow for the control, viewed as a continuous time limit of the policy gradient method. We prove the global convergence of the gradient flow and establish a convergence rate under some regularity assumptions. The main novelty in the analysis is the notion of local optimal control function, which is introduced to characterize the local optimality of the iterate.

Title: Moment-based Density Elicitation with Applications in Probabilistic Loops
Authors: Andrey Kofnov, Ezio Bartocci, Efstathia Bura
Abstract: We propose the K-series estimation approach for the recovery of unknown univariate and multivariate distributions given knowledge of a finite number of their moments. Our method is directly applicable to the probabilistic analysis of systems that can be represented as probabilistic loops; i.e., algorithms that express and implement non-deterministic processes ranging from robotics to macroeconomics and biology to software and cyber-physical systems. K-series statically approximates the joint and marginal distributions of a vector of continuous random variables updated in a probabilistic non-nested loop with nonlinear assignments given a finite number of moments of the unknown density. Moreover, K-series automatically derives the distribution of the systems' random variables symbolically as a function of the loop iteration. K-series density estimates are accurate, easy and fast to compute. We demonstrate the feasibility and performance of our approach on multiple benchmark examples from the literature.

Authors: Jinzheng Zhao, Yong Xu, Xinyuan Qian, Davide Berghi, Peipei Wu, Meng Cui, Jianyuan Sun, Philip J.B. Jackson, Wenwu Wang
Abstract: Audio-visual speaker tracking has drawn increasing attention over the past few years due to its academic values and wide applications. Audio and visual modalities can provide complementary information for localization and tracking. With audio and visual information, the Bayesian-based filter and deep learning-based methods can solve the problem of data association, audio-visual fusion and track management. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive overview of audio-visual speaker tracking. To our knowledge, this is the first extensive survey over the past five years. We introduce the family of Bayesian filters and summarize the methods for obtaining audio-visual measurements. In addition, the existing trackers and their performance on the AV16.3 dataset are summarized. In the past few years, deep learning techniques have thrived, which also boost the development of audio-visual speaker tracking. The influence of deep learning techniques in terms of measurement extraction and state estimation is also discussed. Finally, we discuss the connections between audio-visual speaker tracking and other areas such as speech separation and distributed speaker tracking.

Title: Toward 6G Native-AI Network: Foundation Model based Cloud-Edge-End Collaboration Framework
Authors: Xiang Chen, Zhiheng Guo, Xijun Wang, Howard H. Yang, Chenyuan Feng, Shuangfeng Han, Xiaoyun Wang, Tony Q. S. Quek
Abstract: Future wireless communication networks are in a position to move beyond data-centric, device-oriented connectivity and offer intelligent, immersive experiences based on multi-agent collaboration, especially in the context of the thriving development of pre-trained foundation models (PFM) and the evolving vision of 6G native artificial intelligence (AI). Therefore, redefining modes of collaboration between devices and agents, and constructing native intelligence libraries become critically important in 6G. In this paper, we analyze the challenges of achieving 6G native AI from the perspectives of data, AI models, and operational paradigm. Then, we propose a 6G native AI framework based on foundation models, provide an integration method for the expert knowledge, present the customization for two kinds of PFM, and outline a novel operational paradigm for the native AI framework. As a practical use case, we apply this framework for orchestration, achieving the maximum sum rate within a cell-free massive MIMO system, and presenting preliminary evaluation results. Finally, we outline research directions for achieving native AI in 6G.

Title: HEAR: Hearing Enhanced Audio Response for Video-grounded Dialogue
Authors: Sunjae Yoon, Dahyun Kim, Eunseop Yoon, Hee Suk Yoon, Junyeong Kim, Chnag D. Yoo
Abstract: Video-grounded Dialogue (VGD) aims to answer questions regarding a given multi-modal input comprising video, audio, and dialogue history. Although there have been numerous efforts in developing VGD systems to improve the quality of their responses, existing systems are competent only to incorporate the information in the video and text and tend to struggle in extracting the necessary information from the audio when generating appropriate responses to the question. The VGD system seems to be deaf, and thus, we coin this symptom of current systems' ignoring audio data as a deaf response. To overcome the deaf response problem, Hearing Enhanced Audio Response (HEAR) framework is proposed to perform sensible listening by selectively attending to audio whenever the question requires it. The HEAR framework enhances the accuracy and audibility of VGD systems in a model-agnostic manner. HEAR is validated on VGD datasets (i.e., AVSD@DSTC7 and AVSD@DSTC8) and shows effectiveness with various VGD systems.

Title: Learning-based Observer for Coupled Disturbance
Authors: Jindou Jia, Meng Wang, Zihan Yang, Bin Yang, Yuhang Liu, Kexin Guo, Xiang Yu
Abstract: Achieving high-precision control for robotic systems is hindered by the low-fidelity dynamical model and external disturbances. Especially, the intricate coupling between internal uncertainties and external disturbances further exacerbates this challenge. This study introduces an effective and convergent algorithm enabling accurate estimation of the coupled disturbance via combining control and learning philosophies. Concretely, by resorting to Chebyshev series expansion, the coupled disturbance is firstly decomposed into an unknown parameter matrix and two known structures dependent on system state and external disturbance respectively. A regularized least squares algorithm is subsequently formalized to learn the parameter matrix using historical time-series data. Finally, a polynomial disturbance observer is specifically devised to achieve a high-precision estimation of the coupled disturbance by utilizing the learned portion. The proposed algorithm is evaluated through extensive simulations and real flight tests. We believe this work can offer a new pathway to integrate learning approaches into control frameworks for addressing longstanding challenges in robotic applications.

Title: Online-Score-Aided Federated Learning: Taming the Resource Constraints in Wireless Networks
Authors: Md-Ferdous Pervej, Minseok Choi, Andreas F. Molisch
Abstract: While federated learning (FL) is a widely popular distributed machine learning (ML) strategy that protects data privacy, time-varying wireless network parameters and heterogeneous configurations of the wireless devices pose significant challenges. Although the limited radio and computational resources of the network and the clients, respectively, are widely acknowledged, two critical yet often ignored aspects are (a) wireless devices can only dedicate a small chunk of their limited storage for the FL task and (b) new training samples may arrive in an online manner in many practical wireless applications. Therefore, we propose a new FL algorithm called online-score-aided federated learning (OSAFL), specifically designed to learn tasks relevant to wireless applications under these practical considerations. Since clients' local training steps differ under resource constraints, which may lead to client drift under statistically heterogeneous data distributions, we leverage normalized gradient similarities and exploit weighting clients' updates based on optimized scores that facilitate the convergence rate of the proposed OSAFL algorithm without incurring any communication overheads to the clients or requiring any statistical data information from them. Our extensive simulation results on two different datasets with four popular ML models validate the effectiveness of OSAFL compared to five modified state-of-the-art FL baselines.

Title: An Embedding is Worth a Thousand Noisy Labels
Authors: Francesco Di Salvo, Sebastian Doerrich, Ines Rieger, Christian Ledig
Abstract: The performance of deep neural networks scales with dataset size and label quality, rendering the efficient mitigation of low-quality data annotations crucial for building robust and cost-effective systems. Existing strategies to address label noise exhibit severe limitations due to computational complexity and application dependency. In this work, we propose WANN, a Weighted Adaptive Nearest Neighbor approach that builds on self-supervised feature representations obtained from foundation models. To guide the weighted voting scheme, we introduce a reliability score $\eta$, which measures the likelihood of a data label being correct. WANN outperforms reference methods, including a linear layer trained with robust loss functions, on diverse datasets of varying size and under various noise types and severities. WANN also exhibits superior generalization on imbalanced data compared to both Adaptive-NNs (ANN) and fixed k-NNs. Furthermore, the proposed weighting scheme enhances supervised dimensionality reduction under noisy labels. This yields a significant boost in classification performance with 10x and 100x smaller image embeddings, minimizing latency and storage requirements. Our approach, emphasizing efficiency and explainability, emerges as a simple, robust solution to overcome inherent limitations of deep neural network training.

Title: Consensus in Multiagent Systems under communication failure
Authors: Mohamed Bentaibi, Laura Caravenna, Jean-Paul A. Gauthier, Francesco Rossi
Abstract: We consider multi-agent systems with cooperative interactions and study the convergence to consensus in the case of time-dependent connections, with possible communication failure. We prove a new condition ensuring consensus: we define a graph in which directed arrows correspond to connection functions that converge (in the weak sense) to some function with a positive integral on all intervals of the form $[t,+\infty)$. If the graph has a node reachable from all other indices, i.e.~``globally reachable'', then the system converges to consensus. We show that this requirement generalizes some known sufficient conditions for convergence, such as Moreau's or the Persistent Excitation one. We also give a second new condition, transversal to the known ones: total connectedness of the undirected graph formed by the non-vanishing of limiting functions.

Title: Towards safe Bayesian optimization with Wiener kernel regression
Authors: Oleksii Molodchyk, Johannes Teutsch, Timm Faulwasser
Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a data-driven strategy for minimizing/maximizing black-box functions based on probabilistic surrogate models. In the presence of safety constraints, the performance of BO crucially relies on tight probabilistic error bounds related to the uncertainty surrounding the surrogate model. For the case of Gaussian Process surrogates and Gaussian measurement noise, we present a novel error bound based on the recently proposed Wiener kernel regression. We prove that under rather mild assumptions, the proposed error bound is tighter than bounds previously documented in the literature, leading to enlarged safety regions. We draw upon a numerical example to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed error bound in safe BO.

Title: LoFi: Vision-Aided Label Generator for Wi-Fi Localization and Tracking
Authors: Zijian Zhao, Tingwei Chen, Fanyi Meng, Zhijie Cai, Hang Li, Xiaoyang Li, Guangxu Zhu
Abstract: Data-driven Wi-Fi localization and tracking have shown great promise due to their lower reliance on specialized hardware compared to model-based methods. However, most existing data collection techniques provide only coarse-grained ground truth or a limited number of labeled points, significantly hindering the advancement of data-driven approaches. While systems like lidar can deliver precise ground truth, their high costs make them inaccessible to many users. To address these challenges, we propose LoFi, a vision-aided label generator for Wi-Fi localization and tracking. LoFi can generate ground truth position coordinates solely from 2D images, offering high precision, low cost, and ease of use. Utilizing our method, we have compiled a Wi-Fi tracking and localization dataset using the ESP32-S3 and a webcam, which will be open-sourced along with the code upon publication.

Title: Sketch2Sound: Controllable Audio Generation via Time-Varying Signals and Sonic Imitations
Authors: Hugo Flores García, Oriol Nieto, Justin Salamon, Bryan Pardo, Prem Seetharaman
Abstract: We present Sketch2Sound, a generative audio model capable of creating high-quality sounds from a set of interpretable time-varying control signals: loudness, brightness, and pitch, as well as text prompts. Sketch2Sound can synthesize arbitrary sounds from sonic imitations (i.e.,~a vocal imitation or a reference sound-shape). Sketch2Sound can be implemented on top of any text-to-audio latent diffusion transformer (DiT), and requires only 40k steps of fine-tuning and a single linear layer per control, making it more lightweight than existing methods like ControlNet. To synthesize from sketchlike sonic imitations, we propose applying random median filters to the control signals during training, allowing Sketch2Sound to be prompted using controls with flexible levels of temporal specificity. We show that Sketch2Sound can synthesize sounds that follow the gist of input controls from a vocal imitation while retaining the adherence to an input text prompt and audio quality compared to a text-only baseline. Sketch2Sound allows sound artists to create sounds with the semantic flexibility of text prompts and the expressivity and precision of a sonic gesture or vocal imitation.

Title: Hybrid Feedback Control for Global Navigation with Locally Optimal Obstacle Avoidance in n-Dimensional Spaces
Authors: Ishak Cheniouni, Soulaimane Berkane, Abdelhamid Tayebi
Abstract: We present a hybrid feedback control framework for autonomous robot navigation in n-dimensional Euclidean spaces cluttered with spherical obstacles. The proposed approach ensures safe navigation and global asymptotic stability (GAS) of the target location by dynamically switching between two operational modes: motion-to-destination and locally optimal obstacle-avoidance. It produces continuous velocity inputs, ensures collision-free trajectories and generates locally optimal obstacle avoidance maneuvers. Unlike existing methods, the proposed framework is compatible with range sensors, enabling navigation in both a priori known and unknown environments. Extensive simulations in 2D and 3D settings, complemented by experimental validation on a TurtleBot 4 platform, confirm the efficacy and robustness of the approach. Our results demonstrate shorter paths and smoother trajectories compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining computational efficiency and real-world feasibility.

Title: GRAMC: General-purpose and reconfigurable analog matrix computing architecture
Authors: Lunshuai Pan, Shiqing Wang, Pushen Zuo, Zhong Sun
Abstract: In-memory analog matrix computing (AMC) with resistive random-access memory (RRAM) represents a highly promising solution that solves matrix problems in one step. However, the existing AMC circuits each have a specific connection topology to implement a single computing function, lack of the universality as a matrix processor. In this work, we design a reconfigurable AMC macro for general-purpose matrix computations, which is achieved by configuring proper connections between memory array and amplifier circuits. Based on this macro, we develop a hybrid system that incorporates an on-chip write-verify scheme and digital functional modules, to deliver a general-purpose AMC solver for various applications.

Title: Bridging Impulse Control of Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes and Markov Decision Processes: Frameworks, Extensions, and Open Challenges
Authors: Alice Cleynen, Benoîte de Saporta, Orlane Rossini, Régis Sabbadin, Amélie Vernay
Abstract: Control theory plays a pivotal role in understanding and optimizing the behavior of complex dynamical systems across various scientific and engineering disciplines. Two key frameworks that have emerged for modeling and solving control problems in stochastic systems are piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs) and Markov decision processes (MDPs). Each framework has its unique strengths, and their intersection offers promising opportunities for tackling a broad class of problems, particularly in the context of impulse controls and decision-making in complex systems. The relationship between PDMPs and MDPs is a natural subject of exploration, as embedding impulse control problems for PDMPs into the MDP framework could open new avenues for their analysis and resolution. Specifically, this integration would allow leveraging the computational and theoretical tools developed for MDPs to address the challenges inherent in PDMPs. On the other hand, PDMPs can offer a versatile and simple paradigm to model continuous time problems that are often described as discrete-time MDPs parametrized by complex transition kernels. This transformation has the potential to bridge the gap between the two frameworks, enabling solutions to previously intractable problems and expanding the scope of both fields. This paper presents a comprehensive review of two research domains, illustrated through a recurring medical example. The example is revisited and progressively formalized within the framework of thevarious concepts and objects introduced

Title: Separate Source Channel Coding Is Still What You Need: An LLM-based Rethinking
Authors: Tianqi Ren, Rongpeng Li, Ming-min Zhao, Xianfu Chen, Guangyi Liu, Yang Yang, Zhifeng Zhao, Honggang Zhang
Abstract: Along with the proliferating research interest in Semantic Communication (SemCom), Joint Source Channel Coding (JSCC) has dominated the attention due to the widely assumed existence in efficiently delivering information semantics. %has emerged as a pivotal area of research, aiming to enhance the efficiency and reliability of information transmission through deep learning-based methods. Nevertheless, this paper challenges the conventional JSCC paradigm, and advocates for adoption of Separate Source Channel Coding (SSCC) to enjoy the underlying more degree of freedom for optimization. We demonstrate that SSCC, after leveraging the strengths of Large Language Model (LLM) for source coding and Error Correction Code Transformer (ECCT) complemented for channel decoding, offers superior performance over JSCC. Our proposed framework also effectively highlights the compatibility challenges between SemCom approaches and digital communication systems, particularly concerning the resource costs associated with the transmission of high precision floating point numbers. Through comprehensive evaluations, we establish that empowered by LLM-based compression and ECCT-enhanced error correction, SSCC remains a viable and effective solution for modern communication systems. In other words, separate source and channel coding is still what we need!

Title: BRIGHT: A globally distributed multimodal building damage assessment dataset with very-high-resolution for all-weather disaster response
Authors: Hongruixuan Chen, Jian Song, Olivier Dietrich, Clifford Broni-Bediako, Weihao Xuan, Junjue Wang, Xinlei Shao, Yimin Wei, Junshi Xia, Cuiling Lan, Konrad Schindler, Naoto Yokoya
Abstract: Disaster events occur around the world and cause significant damage to human life and property. Earth observation (EO) data enables rapid and comprehensive building damage assessment (BDA), an essential capability in the aftermath of a disaster to reduce human casualties and to inform disaster relief efforts. Recent research focuses on the development of AI models to achieve accurate mapping of unseen disaster events, mostly using optical EO data. However, solutions based on optical data are limited to clear skies and daylight hours, preventing a prompt response to disasters. Integrating multimodal (MM) EO data, particularly the combination of optical and SAR imagery, makes it possible to provide all-weather, day-and-night disaster responses. Despite this potential, the development of robust multimodal AI models has been constrained by the lack of suitable benchmark datasets. In this paper, we present a BDA dataset using veRy-hIGH-resoluTion optical and SAR imagery (BRIGHT) to support AI-based all-weather disaster response. To the best of our knowledge, BRIGHT is the first open-access, globally distributed, event-diverse MM dataset specifically curated to support AI-based disaster response. It covers five types of natural disasters and two types of man-made disasters across 14 regions worldwide, with a particular focus on developing countries where external assistance is most needed. The optical and SAR imagery in BRIGHT, with a spatial resolution between 0.3-1 meters, provides detailed representations of individual buildings, making it ideal for precise BDA. In our experiments, we have tested seven advanced AI models trained with our BRIGHT to validate the transferability and robustness. The dataset and code are available at this https URL. BRIGHT also serves as the official dataset for the 2025 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest.

Title: Towards Developing Socially Compliant Automated Vehicles: Advances, Expert Insights, and A Conceptual Framework
Authors: Yongqi Dong, Bart van Arem, Haneen Farah
Abstract: Automated Vehicles (AVs) hold promise for revolutionizing transportation by improving road safety, traffic efficiency, and overall mobility. Despite the steady advancement in high-level AVs in recent years, the transition to full automation entails a period of mixed traffic, where AVs of varying automation levels coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Making AVs socially compliant and understood by human drivers is expected to improve the safety and efficiency of mixed traffic. Thus, ensuring AVs' compatibility with HDVs and social acceptance is crucial for their successful and seamless integration into mixed traffic. However, research in this critical area of developing Socially Compliant AVs (SCAVs) remains sparse. This study carries out the first comprehensive scoping review to assess the current state of the art in developing SCAVs, identifying key concepts, methodological approaches, and research gaps. An informal expert interview was also conducted to discuss the literature review results and identify critical research gaps and expectations towards SCAVs. Based on the scoping review and expert interview input, a conceptual framework is proposed for the development of SCAVs. The conceptual framework is evaluated using an online survey targeting researchers, technicians, policymakers, and other relevant professionals worldwide. The survey results provide valuable validation and insights, affirming the significance of the proposed conceptual framework in tackling the challenges of integrating AVs into mixed-traffic environments. Additionally, future research perspectives and suggestions are discussed, contributing to the research and development agenda of SCAVs.

Title: Optimizing wheel loader performance -- an end-to-end approach
Authors: Koji Aoshima, Eddie Wadbro, Martin Servin
Abstract: Wheel loaders in mines and construction sites repeatedly load soil from a pile to load receivers. This task presents a challenging optimization problem since each loading's performance depends on the pile state, which depends on previous loadings. We investigate an end-to-end optimization approach considering future loading outcomes and transportation costs between the pile and load receivers. To predict the evolution of the pile state and the loading performance, we use world models that leverage deep neural networks trained on numerous simulated loading cycles. A look-ahead tree search optimizes the sequence of loading actions by evaluating the performance of thousands of action candidates, which expand into subsequent action candidates under the predicted pile states recursively. Test results demonstrate that, over a horizon of 15 sequential loadings, the look-ahead tree search is 6% more efficient than a greedy strategy, which always selects the action that maximizes the current single loading performance, and 14% more efficient than using a fixed loading controller optimized for the nominal case.

Title: UniForm: A Unified Multi-Task Diffusion Transformer for Audio-Video Generation
Authors: Lei Zhao, Linfeng Feng, Dongxu Ge, Rujin Chen, Fangqiu Yi, Chi Zhang, Xiao-Lei Zhang, Xuelong Li
Abstract: With the rise of diffusion models, audio-video generation has been revolutionized. However, most existing methods rely on separate modules for each modality, with limited exploration of unified generative architectures. In addition, many are confined to a single task and small-scale datasets. To address these limitations, we first propose UniForm, a unified multi-task diffusion transformer that jointly generates audio and visual modalities in a shared latent space. A single diffusion process models both audio and video, capturing the inherent correlations between sound and vision. Second, we introduce task-specific noise schemes and task tokens, enabling a single model to support multiple tasks, including text-to-audio-video, audio-to-video, and video-to-audio generation. Furthermore, by leveraging large language models and a large-scale text-audio-video combined dataset, UniForm achieves greater generative diversity than prior approaches. Extensive experiments show that UniForm achieves the state-of-the-art performance across audio-video generation tasks, producing content that is both well-aligned and close to real-world data distributions.

Abstract: Radiotherapy treatment for prostate cancer relies on computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for segmentation of target volumes and organs at risk (OARs). Manual segmentation of these volumes is regarded as the gold standard for ground truth in machine learning applications but to acquire such data is tedious and time-consuming. A publicly available clinical dataset is presented, comprising MRI- and synthetic CT (sCT) images, target and OARs segmentations, and radiotherapy dose distributions for 432 prostate cancer patients treated with MRI-guided radiotherapy. An extended dataset with 35 patients is also included, with the addition of deep learning (DL)-generated segmentations, DL segmentation uncertainty maps, and DL segmentations manually adjusted by four radiation oncologists. The publication of these resources aims to aid research within the fields of automated radiotherapy treatment planning, segmentation, inter-observer analyses, and DL model uncertainty investigation. The dataset is hosted on the AIDA Data Hub and offers a free-to-use resource for the scientific community, valuable for the advancement of medical imaging and prostate cancer radiotherapy research.

Title: Designing Neural Synthesizers for Low-Latency Interaction
Authors: Franco Caspe, Jordie Shier, Mark Sandler, Charalampos Saitis, Andrew McPherson
Abstract: Neural Audio Synthesis (NAS) models offer interactive musical control over high-quality, expressive audio generators. While these models can operate in real-time, they often suffer from high latency, making them unsuitable for intimate musical interaction. The impact of architectural choices in deep learning models on audio latency remains largely unexplored in the NAS literature. In this work, we investigate the sources of latency and jitter typically found in interactive NAS models. We then apply this analysis to the task of timbre transfer using RAVE, a convolutional variational autoencoder for audio waveforms introduced by Caillon et al. in 2021. Finally, we present an iterative design approach for optimizing latency. This culminates with a model we call BRAVE (Bravely Realtime Audio Variational autoEncoder), which is low-latency and exhibits better pitch and loudness replication while showing timbre modification capabilities similar to RAVE. We implement it in a specialized inference framework for low-latency, real-time inference and present a proof-of-concept audio plugin compatible with audio signals from musical instruments. We expect the challenges and guidelines described in this document to support NAS researchers in designing models for low-latency inference from the ground up, enriching the landscape of possibilities for musicians.

Title: EgoEvGesture: Gesture Recognition Based on Egocentric Event Camera
Authors: Luming Wang, Hao Shi, Xiaoting Yin, Kailun Yang, Kaiwei Wang, Jian Bai
Abstract: Egocentric gesture recognition is a pivotal technology for enhancing natural human-computer interaction, yet traditional RGB-based solutions suffer from motion blur and illumination variations in dynamic scenarios. While event cameras show distinct advantages in handling high dynamic range with ultra-low power consumption, existing RGB-based architectures face inherent limitations in processing asynchronous event streams due to their synchronous frame-based nature. Moreover, from an egocentric perspective, event cameras record data that includes events generated by both head movements and hand gestures, thereby increasing the complexity of gesture recognition. To address this, we propose a novel network architecture specifically designed for event data processing, incorporating (1) a lightweight CNN with asymmetric depthwise convolutions to reduce parameters while preserving spatiotemporal features, (2) a plug-and-play state-space model as context block that decouples head movement noise from gesture dynamics, and (3) a parameter-free Bins-Temporal Shift Module (BSTM) that shifts features along bins and temporal dimensions to fuse sparse events efficiently. We further establish the EgoEvGesture dataset, the first large-scale dataset for egocentric gesture recognition using event cameras. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 62.7% accuracy tested on unseen subjects with only 7M parameters, 3.1% higher than state-of-the-art approaches. Notable misclassifications in freestyle motions stem from high inter-personal variability and unseen test patterns differing from training data. Moreover, our approach achieved a remarkable accuracy of 97.0% on the DVS128 Gesture, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalization capability of our method on public datasets. The dataset and models are made available at this https URL.

Title: CTorch: PyTorch-Compatible GPU-Accelerated Auto-Differentiable Projector Toolbox for Computed Tomography
Authors: Xiao Jiang, Grace J. Grace, J. Webster Stayman
Abstract: This work introduces CTorch, a PyTorch-compatible, GPU-accelerated, and auto-differentiable projector toolbox designed to handle various CT geometries with configurable projector algorithms. CTorch provides flexible scanner geometry definition, supporting 2D fan-beam, 3D circular cone-beam, and 3D non-circular cone-beam geometries. Each geometry allows view-specific definitions to accommodate variations during scanning. Both flat- and curved-detector models may be specified to accommodate various clinical devices. CTorch implements four projector algorithms: voxel-driven, ray-driven, distance-driven (DD), and separable footprint (SF), allowing users to balance accuracy and computational efficiency based on their needs. All the projectors are primarily built using CUDA C for GPU acceleration, then compiled as Python-callable functions, and wrapped as PyTorch network module. This design allows direct use of PyTorch tensors, enabling seamless integration into PyTorch's auto-differentiation framework. These features make CTorch an flexible and efficient tool for CT imaging research, with potential applications in accurate CT simulations, efficient iterative reconstruction, and advanced deep-learning-based CT reconstruction.

Title: Online Convex Optimization and Integral Quadratic Constraints: A new approach to regret analysis
Authors: Fabian Jakob, Andrea Iannelli
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for analyzing dynamic regret of first-order constrained online convex optimization algorithms for strongly convex and Lipschitz-smooth objectives. Crucially, we provide a general analysis that is applicable to a wide range of first-order algorithms that can be expressed as an interconnection of a linear dynamical system in feedback with a first-order oracle. By leveraging Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQCs), we derive a semi-definite program which, when feasible, provides a regret guarantee for the online algorithm. For this, the concept of variational IQCs is introduced as the generalization of IQCs to time-varying monotone operators. Our bounds capture the temporal rate of change of the problem in the form of the path length of the time-varying minimizer and the objective function variation. In contrast to standard results in OCO, our results do not require nerither the assumption of gradient boundedness, nor that of a bounded feasible set. Numerical analyses showcase the ability of the approach to capture the dependence of the regret on the function class condition number.

Title: FUSION: Frequency-guided Underwater Spatial Image recOnstructioN
Authors: Jaskaran Singh Walia, Shravan Venkatraman, Pavithra LK
Abstract: Underwater images suffer from severe degradations, including color distortions, reduced visibility, and loss of structural details due to wavelength-dependent attenuation and scattering. Existing enhancement methods primarily focus on spatial-domain processing, neglecting the frequency domain's potential to capture global color distributions and long-range dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose FUSION, a dual-domain deep learning framework that jointly leverages spatial and frequency domain information. FUSION independently processes each RGB channel through multi-scale convolutional kernels and adaptive attention mechanisms in the spatial domain, while simultaneously extracting global structural information via FFT-based frequency attention. A Frequency Guided Fusion module integrates complementary features from both domains, followed by inter-channel fusion and adaptive channel recalibration to ensure balanced color distributions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets (UIEB, EUVP, SUIM-E) demonstrate that FUSION achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming existing methods in reconstruction fidelity (highest PSNR of 23.717 dB and SSIM of 0.883 on UIEB), perceptual quality (lowest LPIPS of 0.112 on UIEB), and visual enhancement metrics (best UIQM of 3.414 on UIEB), while requiring significantly fewer parameters (0.28M) and lower computational complexity, demonstrating its suitability for real-time underwater imaging applications.

Title: Probabilistic Reachable Set Estimation for Saturated Systems with Unbounded Additive Disturbances
Authors: Carlo Karam, Matteo Tacchi-Bénard, Mirko Fiacchini
Abstract: In this paper, we present an analytical approach for the synthesis of ellipsoidal probabilistic reachable sets of saturated systems subject to unbounded additive noise. Using convex optimization methods, we compute a contraction factor of the saturated error dynamics that allows us to tightly bound its evolution and therefore construct accurate reachable sets. The proposed approach is applicable to independent, zero mean disturbances with a known covariance. A numerical example illustrates the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed design.

Title: Efficient Simulation of Singularly Perturbed Systems Using a Stabilized Multirate Explicit Scheme
Authors: Yibo Shi, Cristian R. Rojas
Abstract: Singularly perturbed systems (SPSs) are prevalent in engineering applications, where numerically solving their initial value problems (IVPs) is challenging due to stiffness arising from multiple time scales. Classical explicit methods require impractically small time steps for stability, while implicit methods developed for SPSs are computationally intensive and less efficient for strongly nonlinear systems. This paper introduces a Stabilized Multirate Explicit Scheme (SMES) that stabilizes classical explicit methods without the need for small time steps or implicit formulations. By employing a multirate approach with variable time steps, SMES allows the fast dynamics to rapidly converge to their equilibrium manifold while slow dynamics evolve with larger steps. Analysis shows that SMES achieves numerical stability with significantly reduced computational effort and controlled error. Its effectiveness is illustrated with a numerical example.
