Title: Learning Hemodynamic Scalar Fields on Coronary Artery Meshes: A Benchmark of Geometric Deep Learning Models
Authors: Guido Nannini, Julian Suk, Patryk Rygiel, Simone Saitta, Luca Mariani, Riccardo Maranga, Andrea Baggiano, Gianluca Pontone, Alberto Redaelli
Abstract: Coronary artery disease, caused by the narrowing of coronary vessels due to atherosclerosis, is the leading cause of death worldwide. The diagnostic gold standard, fractional flow reserve (FFR), measures the trans-stenotic pressure ratio during maximal vasodilation but is invasive and costly. This has driven the development of virtual FFR (vFFR) using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate coronary flow. Geometric deep learning algorithms have shown promise for learning features on meshes, including cardiovascular research applications. This study empirically analyzes various backends for predicting vFFR fields in coronary arteries as CFD surrogates, comparing six backends for learning hemodynamics on meshes using CFD solutions as ground truth. The study has two parts: i) Using 1,500 synthetic left coronary artery bifurcations, models were trained to predict pressure-related fields for vFFR reconstruction, comparing different learning variables. ii) Using 427 patient-specific CFD simulations, experiments were repeated focusing on the best-performing learning variable from the synthetic dataset. Most backends performed well on the synthetic dataset, especially when predicting pressure drop over the manifold. Transformer-based backends outperformed others when predicting pressure and vFFR fields and were the only models achieving strong performance on patient-specific data, excelling in both average per-point error and vFFR accuracy in stenotic lesions. These results suggest geometric deep learning backends can effectively replace CFD for simple geometries, while transformer-based networks are superior for complex, heterogeneous datasets. Pressure drop was identified as the optimal network output for learning pressure-related fields.

Title: Dynamic-Aware Spatio-temporal Representation Learning for Dynamic MRI Reconstruction
Authors: Dayoung Baik, Jaejun Yoo
Abstract: Dynamic MRI reconstruction, one of inverse problems, has seen a surge by the use of deep learning techniques. Especially, the practical difficulty of obtaining ground truth data has led to the emergence of unsupervised learning approaches. A recent promising method among them is implicit neural representation (INR), which defines the data as a continuous function that maps coordinate values to the corresponding signal values. This allows for filling in missing information only with incomplete measurements and solving the inverse problem effectively. Nevertheless, previous works incorporating this method have faced drawbacks such as long optimization time and the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning. To address these issues, we propose Dynamic-Aware INR (DA-INR), an INR-based model for dynamic MRI reconstruction that captures the spatial and temporal continuity of dynamic MRI data in the image domain and explicitly incorporates the temporal redundancy of the data into the model structure. As a result, DA-INR outperforms other models in reconstruction quality even at extreme undersampling ratios while significantly reducing optimization time and requiring minimal hyperparameter tuning.

Title: Continual Test-Time Adaptation for Single Image Defocus Deblurring via Causal Siamese Networks
Authors: Shuang Cui, Yi Li, Jiangmeng Li, Xiongxin Tang, Bing Su, Fanjiang Xu, Hui Xiong
Abstract: Single image defocus deblurring (SIDD) aims to restore an all-in-focus image from a defocused one. Distribution shifts in defocused images generally lead to performance degradation of existing methods during out-of-distribution inferences. In this work, we gauge the intrinsic reason behind the performance degradation, which is identified as the heterogeneity of lens-specific point spread functions. Empirical evidence supports this finding, motivating us to employ a continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) paradigm for SIDD. However, traditional CTTA methods, which primarily rely on entropy minimization, cannot sufficiently explore task-dependent information for pixel-level regression tasks like SIDD. To address this issue, we propose a novel Siamese networks-based continual test-time adaptation framework, which adapts source models to continuously changing target domains only requiring unlabeled target data in an online manner. To further mitigate semantically erroneous textures introduced by source SIDD models under severe degradation, we revisit the learning paradigm through a structural causal model and propose Causal Siamese networks (CauSiam). Our method leverages large-scale pre-trained vision-language models to derive discriminative universal semantic priors and integrates these priors into Siamese networks, ensuring causal identifiability between blurry inputs and restored images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CauSiam effectively improves the generalization performance of existing SIDD methods in continuously changing domains.

Title: UNIR-Net: A Novel Approach for Restoring Underwater Images with Non-Uniform Illumination Using Synthetic Data
Authors: Ezequiel Perez-Zarate, Chunxiao Liu, Oscar Ramos-Soto, Diego Oliva, Marco Perez-Cisneros
Abstract: Enhancing underwater images with non-uniform illumination (NUI) is crucial for improving visibility and visual quality in marine environments, where image degradation is caused by significant absorption and scattering effects. However, traditional model-based methods are often ineffective at capturing the complex illumination variations present in such images, resulting in limited visual improvements. On the other hand, learning-based approaches have shown promising results but face challenges due to the lack of specific datasets designed to effectively address the non-uniform illumination problem. To overcome these challenges, the Underwater Non-uniform Illumination Restoration Network (UNIR-Net) is introduced, a novel method that integrates illumination enhancement and attention blocks, along with visual refinement and contrast correction modules. This approach is specifically designed to mitigate the scattering and absorption effects that cause light attenuation in underwater environments. Additionally, the Paired Underwater Non-uniform Illumination (PUNI) dataset is presented, a paired resource that facilitates the restoration of underwater images under non-uniform illumination conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on the PUNI dataset and the large-scale real-world Non-Uniform Illumination Dataset (NUID), which contains underwater images with non-uniform illumination, demonstrate the robust generalization ability of UNIR-Net. This method outperforms existing approaches in both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations. Furthermore, UNIR-Net not only significantly enhances the visual quality of images but also improves performance in advanced computer vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation in underwater environments, highlighting its broad applicability and potential impact.

Title: NeurOp-Diff:Continuous Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution via Neural Operator Diffusion
Authors: Zihao Xu, Yuzhi Tang, Bowen Xu, Qingquan Li
Abstract: Most publicly accessible remote sensing data suffer from low resolution, limiting their practical applications. To address this, we propose a diffusion model guided by neural operators for continuous remote sensing image super-resolution (NeurOp-Diff). Neural operators are used to learn resolution representations at arbitrary scales, encoding low-resolution (LR) images into high-dimensional features, which are then used as prior conditions to guide the diffusion model for denoising. This effectively addresses the artifacts and excessive smoothing issues present in existing super-resolution (SR) methods, enabling the generation of high-quality, continuous super-resolution images. Specifically, we adjust the super-resolution scale by a scaling factor s, allowing the model to adapt to different super-resolution magnifications. Furthermore, experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of NeurOp-Diff. Our code is available at this https URL.

Title: Self Pre-training with Adaptive Mask Autoencoders for Variable-Contrast 3D Medical Imaging
Authors: Badhan Kumar Das, Gengyan Zhao, Han Liu, Thomas J. Re, Dorin Comaniciu, Eli Gibson, Andreas Maier
Abstract: The Masked Autoencoder (MAE) has recently demonstrated effectiveness in pre-training Vision Transformers (ViT) for analyzing natural images. By reconstructing complete images from partially masked inputs, the ViT encoder gathers contextual information to predict the missing regions. This capability to aggregate context is especially important in medical imaging, where anatomical structures are functionally and mechanically linked to surrounding regions. However, current methods do not consider variations in the number of input images, which is typically the case in real-world Magnetic Resonance (MR) studies. To address this limitation, we propose a 3D Adaptive Masked Autoencoders (AMAE) architecture that accommodates a variable number of 3D input contrasts per subject. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset of 45,364 subjects was used for pretraining and a subset of 1648 training, 193 validation and 215 test subjects were used for finetuning. The performance demonstrates that self pre-training of this adaptive masked autoencoders can enhance the infarct segmentation performance by 2.8%-3.7% for ViT-based segmentation models.

Title: Relation U-Net
Authors: Sheng He, Rina Bao, P. Ellen Grant, Yangming Ou
Abstract: Towards clinical interpretations, this paper presents a new ''output-with-confidence'' segmentation neural network with multiple input images and multiple output segmentation maps and their pairwise relations. A confidence score of the test image without ground-truth can be estimated from the difference among the estimated relation maps. We evaluate the method based on the widely used vanilla U-Net for segmentation and our new model is named Relation U-Net which can output segmentation maps of the input images as well as an estimated confidence score of the test image without ground-truth. Experimental results on four public datasets show that Relation U-Net can not only provide better accuracy than vanilla U-Net but also estimate a confidence score which is linearly correlated to the segmentation accuracy on test images.

Title: persoDA: Personalized Data Augmentation forPersonalized ASR
Authors: Pablo Peso Parada, Spyros Fontalis, Md Asif Jalal, Karthikeyan Saravanan, Anastasios Drosou, Mete Ozay, Gil Ho Lee, Jungin Lee, Seokyeong Jung
Abstract: Data augmentation (DA) is ubiquitously used in training of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models. DA offers increased data variability, robustness and generalization against different acoustic distortions. Recently, personalization of ASR models on mobile devices has been shown to improve Word Error Rate (WER). This paper evaluates data augmentation in this context and proposes persoDA; a DA method driven by user's data utilized to personalize ASR. persoDA aims to augment training with data specifically tuned towards acoustic characteristics of the end-user, as opposed to standard augmentation based on Multi-Condition Training (MCT) that applies random reverberation and noises. Our evaluation with an ASR conformer-based baseline trained on Librispeech and personalized for VOICES shows that persoDA achieves a 13.9% relative WER reduction over using standard data augmentation (using random noise & reverberation). Furthermore, persoDA shows 16% to 20% faster convergence over MCT.

Title: Deep Distance Map Regression Network with Shape-aware Loss for Imbalanced Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Huiyu Li, Xiabi Liu, Said Boumaraf, Xiaopeng Gong, Donghai Liao, Xiaohong Ma
Abstract: Small object segmentation, like tumor segmentation, is a difficult and critical task in the field of medical image analysis. Although deep learning based methods have achieved promising performance, they are restricted to the use of binary segmentation mask. Inspired by the rigorous mapping between binary segmentation mask and distance map, we adopt distance map as a novel ground truth and employ a network to fulfill the computation of distance map. Specially, we propose a new segmentation framework that incorporates the existing binary segmentation network and a light weight regression network (dubbed as LR-Net). Thus, the LR-Net can convert the distance map computation into a regression task and leverage the rich information of distance maps. Additionally, we derive a shape-aware loss by employing distance maps as penalty map to infer the complete shape of an object. We evaluated our approach on MICCAI 2017 Liver Tumor Segmentation (LiTS) Challenge dataset and a clinical dataset. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the classification-based methods as well as other existing state-of-the-arts.

Title: Reducing real-time complexity via sub-control Lyapunov functions: from theory to experiments
Authors: Huu-Thinh Do, Franco Blanchini, Stefano Miani, Ionela Prodan
Abstract: The techniques to design control Lyapunov functions (CLF), along with a proper stabilizing feedback, possibly in the presence of constraints, often provide control laws that are too complex for proper implementation online, especially when an optimization problem is involved. In this work, we show how to acquire an alternative, computationally attractive feedback. Given a nominal CLF and a nominal state feedback, we say that a different positive definite function is a Sub-control Lyapunov function (SCLF) if its Lyapunov derivative is negative-definite and bounded above by the Lyapunov derivative of the nominal function with the nominal control. It turns out that if we consider a family of basis functions, then a SCLF can be computed by linear programming, with an infinite number of constraints. The idea is that although the offline computational burden to achieve the new controller and solve the linear program is considerable, the online computational burden is drastically reduced. Comprehensive simulations and experiments on drone control are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the study.

Title: Towards detecting the pathological subharmonic voicing with fully convolutional neural networks
Authors: Takeshi Ikuma, Melda Kunduk, Brad Story, Andrew J. McWhorter
Abstract: Many voice disorders induce subharmonic phonation, but voice signal analysis is currently lacking a technique to detect the presence of subharmonics reliably. Distinguishing subharmonic phonation from normal phonation is a challenging task as both are nearly periodic phenomena. Subharmonic phonation adds cyclical variations to the normal glottal cycles. Hence, the estimation of subharmonic period requires a wholistic analysis of the signals. Deep learning is an effective solution to this type of complex problem. This paper describes fully convolutional neural networks which are trained with synthesized subharmonic voice signals to classify the subharmonic periods. Synthetic evaluation shows over 98% classification accuracy, and assessment of sustained vowel recordings demonstrates encouraging outcomes as well as the areas for future improvements.

Title: Beyond Speaker Identity: Text Guided Target Speech Extraction
Authors: Mingyue Huo, Abhinav Jain, Cong Phuoc Huynh, Fanjie Kong, Pichao Wang, Zhu Liu, Vimal Bhat
Abstract: Target Speech Extraction (TSE) traditionally relies on explicit clues about the speaker's identity like enrollment audio, face images, or videos, which may not always be available. In this paper, we propose a text-guided TSE model StyleTSE that uses natural language descriptions of speaking style in addition to the audio clue to extract the desired speech from a given mixture. Our model integrates a speech separation network adapted from SepFormer with a bi-modality clue network that flexibly processes both audio and text clues. To train and evaluate our model, we introduce a new dataset TextrolMix with speech mixtures and natural language descriptions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively separates speech based not only on who is speaking, but also on how they are speaking, enhancing TSE in scenarios where traditional audio clues are absent.

Title: Cancer-Net PCa-Seg: Benchmarking Deep Learning Models for Prostate Cancer Segmentation Using Synthetic Correlated Diffusion Imaging
Authors: Jarett Dewbury, Chi-en Amy Tai, Alexander Wong
Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most prevalent cancer among men in the United States, accounting for nearly 300,000 cases, 29% of all diagnoses and 35,000 total deaths in 2024. Traditional screening methods such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been pivotal in diagnosis, but have faced limitations in specificity and generalizability. In this paper, we explore the potential of enhancing PCa lesion segmentation using a novel MRI modality called synthetic correlated diffusion imaging (CDI$^s$). We employ several state-of-the-art deep learning models, including U-Net, SegResNet, Swin UNETR, Attention U-Net, and LightM-UNet, to segment PCa lesions from a 200 CDI$^s$ patient cohort. We find that SegResNet achieved superior segmentation performance with a Dice-Sorensen coefficient (DSC) of $76.68 \pm 0.8$. Notably, the Attention U-Net, while slightly less accurate (DSC $74.82 \pm 2.0$), offered a favorable balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate the potential of deep learning models in improving PCa lesion segmentation using CDI$^s$ to enhance PCa management and clinical support.

Title: Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Resource Management in Integrated Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial Networks
Authors: Muhammad Ahmed Mohsin, Hassan Rizwan, Muhammad Umer, Sagnik Bhattacharya, Ahsan Bilal, John M. Cioffi
Abstract: Efficient spectrum allocation has become crucial as the surge in wireless-connected devices demands seamless support for more users and applications, a trend expected to grow with 6G. Innovations in satellite technologies such as SpaceX's Starlink have enabled non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) to work alongside terrestrial networks (TNs) and allocate spectrum based on regional demands. Existing spectrum sharing approaches in TNs use machine learning for interference minimization through power allocation and spectrum sensing, but the unique characteristics of NTNs like varying orbital dynamics and coverage patterns require more sophisticated coordination mechanisms. The proposed work uses a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) approach for efficient spectrum allocation across TN-NTN networks. DRL agents are present at each TN-NTN hierarchy that dynamically learn and allocate spectrum based on regional trends. This framework is 50x faster than the exhaustive search algorithm while achieving 95\% of optimum spectral efficiency. Moreover, it is 3.75x faster than multi-agent DRL, which is commonly used for spectrum sharing, and has a 12\% higher overall average throughput.

Title: Near-Field XL-MIMO Systems with Sparse UPAs
Authors: Xianzhe Chen, Hong Ren, Cunhua Pan
Abstract: This paper investigates a downlink near-field extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) communication system with sparse uniform planar arrays (UPAs). Based on the Green's function-based channel model, the paper focuses on the power distribution of the arrived signal near the focused point of the transmit sparse UPA. In the vicinity of the focused point, along the x-axis and z-axis directions, closed-form expressions for the power distributions are derived. Based on that, expressions for the width and length of the main lobe are obtained in closed form, both of which decrease as the antenna spacing increases. Furthermore, the paper introduces a crucial constraint on system parameters, under which effective degrees-of-freedom (EDoF) of XL-MIMO systems with sparse UPAs can be precisely estimated. Then, the paper proposes an algorithm to obtain a closed-form expression, which can estimate EDoF with high accuracy and low computational complexity. The numerical results verifies the correctness of the main results of this paper. Furthermore, the numerical results reveals the improvement in the performance of XL-MIMO systems with the use of sparse UPAs.

Title: Domain-conditioned and Temporal-guided Diffusion Modeling for Accelerated Dynamic MRI Reconstruction
Authors: Liping Zhang, Iris Yuwen Zhou, Sydney B. Montesi, Li Feng, Fang Liu
Abstract: Purpose: To propose a domain-conditioned and temporal-guided diffusion modeling method, termed dynamic Diffusion Modeling (dDiMo), for accelerated dynamic MRI reconstruction, enabling diffusion process to characterize spatiotemporal information for time-resolved multi-coil Cartesian and non-Cartesian data. Methods: The dDiMo framework integrates temporal information from time-resolved dimensions, allowing for the concurrent capture of intra-frame spatial features and inter-frame temporal dynamics in diffusion modeling. It employs additional spatiotemporal ($x$-$t$) and self-consistent frequency-temporal ($k$-$t$) priors to guide the diffusion process. This approach ensures precise temporal alignment and enhances the recovery of fine image details. To facilitate a smooth diffusion process, the nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithm is utilized during the reverse diffusion steps. The proposed model was tested on two types of MRI data: Cartesian-acquired multi-coil cardiac MRI and Golden-Angle-Radial-acquired multi-coil free-breathing lung MRI, across various undersampling rates. Results: dDiMo achieved high-quality reconstructions at various acceleration factors, demonstrating improved temporal alignment and structural recovery compared to other competitive reconstruction methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively. This proposed diffusion framework exhibited robust performance in handling both Cartesian and non-Cartesian acquisitions, effectively reconstructing dynamic datasets in cardiac and lung MRI under different imaging conditions. Conclusion: This study introduces a novel diffusion modeling method for dynamic MRI reconstruction.

The proposed condition allows the design of a safe controller synthesis that ensures system safety while avoiding the conservative bounds of safe probabilities. In particular, this study focuses on the design of CBFs that provide flexibility in the choice of functions to obtain tighter bounds on the safe probabilities. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

Title: Quantum-Enhanced Transformers for Robust Acoustic Scene Classification in IoT Environments
Authors: Minh K. Quan, Mayuri Wijayasundara, Sujeeva Setunge, Pubudu N. Pathirana
Abstract: The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices equipped with acoustic sensors necessitates robust acoustic scene classification (ASC) capabilities, even in noisy and data-limited environments. Traditional machine learning methods often struggle to generalize effectively under such conditions. To address this, we introduce Q-ASC, a novel Quantum-Inspired Acoustic Scene Classifier that leverages the power of quantum-inspired transformers. By integrating quantum concepts like superposition and entanglement, Q-ASC achieves superior feature learning and enhanced noise resilience compared to classical models. Furthermore, we introduce a Quantum Variational Autoencoder (QVAE) based data augmentation technique to mitigate the challenge of limited labeled data in IoT deployments. Extensive evaluations on the Tampere University of Technology (TUT) Acoustic Scenes 2016 benchmark dataset demonstrate that Q-ASC achieves remarkable accuracy between 68.3% and 88.5% under challenging conditions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by over 5% in the best case. This research paves the way for deploying intelligent acoustic sensing in IoT networks, with potential applications in smart homes, industrial monitoring, and environmental surveillance, even in adverse acoustic environments.

Title: Joint Transmission and Deblurring: A Semantic Communication Approach Using Events
Authors: Pujing Yang, Guangyi Zhang, Yunlong Cai, Lei Yu, Guanding Yu
Abstract: Deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) is emerging as a promising technology for effective image transmission. However, most existing approaches focus on transmitting clear images, overlooking real-world challenges such as motion blur caused by camera shaking or fast-moving objects. Motion blur often degrades image quality, making transmission and reconstruction more challenging. Event cameras, which asynchronously record pixel intensity changes with extremely low latency, have shown great potential for motion deblurring tasks. However, the efficient transmission of the abundant data generated by event cameras remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a novel JSCC framework for the joint transmission of blurry images and events, aimed at achieving high-quality reconstructions under limited channel bandwidth. This approach is designed as a deblurring task-oriented JSCC system. Since RGB cameras and event cameras capture the same scene through different modalities, their outputs contain both shared and domain-specific information. To avoid repeatedly transmitting the shared information, we extract and transmit their shared information and domain-specific information, respectively. At the receiver, the received signals are processed by a deblurring decoder to generate clear images. Additionally, we introduce a multi-stage training strategy to train the proposed model. Simulation results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing JSCC-based image transmission schemes, addressing motion blur effectively.

Title: PISCO: Self-Supervised k-Space Regularization for Improved Neural Implicit k-Space Representations of Dynamic MRI
Authors: Veronika Spieker, Hannah Eichhorn, Wenqi Huang, Jonathan K. Stelter, Tabita Catalan, Rickmer F. Braren, Daniel Rueckert, Francisco Sahli Costabal, Kerstin Hammernik, Dimitrios C. Karampinos, Claudia Prieto, Julia A. Schnabel
Abstract: Neural implicit k-space representations (NIK) have shown promising results for dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at high temporal resolutions. Yet, reducing acquisition time, and thereby available training data, results in severe performance drops due to overfitting. To address this, we introduce a novel self-supervised k-space loss function $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{PISCO}$, applicable for regularization of NIK-based reconstructions. The proposed loss function is based on the concept of parallel imaging-inspired self-consistency (PISCO), enforcing a consistent global k-space neighborhood relationship without requiring additional data. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on static and dynamic MR reconstructions show that integrating PISCO significantly improves NIK representations. Particularly for high acceleration factors (R$\geq$54), NIK with PISCO achieves superior spatio-temporal reconstruction quality compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, an extensive analysis of the loss assumptions and stability shows PISCO's potential as versatile self-supervised k-space loss function for further applications and architectures.

Title: Physical Layer Design for Ambient IoT
Authors: Rohit Singh, Anil Kumar Yerrapragada, Radha Krishna Ganti
Abstract: There is a growing demand for ultra low power and ultra low complexity devices for applications which require maintenance-free and battery-less operation. One way to serve such applications is through backscatter devices, which communicate using energy harvested from ambient sources such as radio waves transmitted by a reader. Traditional backscatter devices, such as RFID, are limited by range, interference, low connection density, and security issues. To address these problems, the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has started working on Ambient IoT (A-IoT). For the realization of A-IoT devices, various aspects ranging from physical layer design, to the protocol stack, to the device architecture should be standardized. In this paper, we provide an overview of the standardization efforts on the physical layer design for A-IoT devices. The various physical channels and signals are discussed, followed by link level simulations to compare the performance of various configurations of reader to device and device to reader channels.

Title: Power-Efficient RAN Intelligent Controllers Through Optimized KPI Monitoring
Authors: João Paulo S. H. Lima, George N. Katsaros, Konstantinos Nikitopoulos
Abstract: The Open Radio Access Network (RAN) paradigm envisions a more flexible, interoperable, and intelligent RAN ecosystem via new open interfaces and elements like the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC). However, the impact of these elements on Open RAN's power consumption remains heavily unexplored. This work for the first time evaluates the impact of Key Performance Indicator (KPI) monitoring on RIC's power consumption using real traffic and power measurements. By analyzing various RIC-RAN communication scenarios, we identify that RIC's power consumption can become a scalability bottleneck, particularly in large-scale deployments, even when RIC is limited to its core operational functionalities and without incorporating application-specific processes. In this context, also for the first time we explore potential power savings through the elimination of redundant KPI transmissions, extending existing techniques for identical subscription removal and KPI selection, achieving significant power consumption gains exceeding 87\% of the overall RIC power consumption.

Title: A Dataset Generation Toolbox for Dynamic Security Assessment: On the Role of the Security Boundary
Authors: Bastien Giraud, Lola Charles, Agnes Marjorie Nakiganda, Johanna Vorwerk, Spyros Chatzivasileiadis
Abstract: Dynamic security assessment (DSA) is crucial for ensuring the reliable operation of power systems. However, conventional DSA approaches are becoming intractable for future power systems, driving interest in more computationally efficient data-driven methods. Efficient dataset generation is a cornerstone of these methods. While importance and generic sampling techniques often focus on operating points near the system's security boundary, systematic methods for sampling in this region remain scarce. Furthermore, the impact of sampling near the security boundary on the performance of data-driven DSA methods has yet to be established. This paper highlights the critical role of accurately capturing security boundaries for effective security assessment. As such, we propose a novel method for generating a high number of samples close to the security boundary, considering both AC feasibility and small-signal stability. Case studies on the PGLib-OPF 39-bus and PGLib-OPF 162-bus systems demonstrate the importance of including boundary-adjacent operating points in training datasets while maintaining a balanced distribution of secure and insecure points.

Title: Multi-task deep-learning for sleep event detection and stage classification
Authors: Adriana Anido-Alonso, Diego Alvarez-Estevez
Abstract: Polysomnographic sleep analysis is the standard clinical method to accurately diagnose and treat sleep disorders. It is an intricate process which involves the manual identification, classification, and location of multiple sleep event patterns. This is complex, for which identification of different types of events involves focusing on different subsets of signals, resulting on an iterative time-consuming process entailing several visual analysis passes. In this paper we propose a multi-task deep-learning approach for the simultaneous detection of sleep events and hypnogram construction in one single pass. Taking as reference state-of-the-art methodology for object-detection in the field of Computer Vision, we reformulate the problem for the analysis of multi-variate time sequences, and more specifically for pattern detection in the sleep analysis scenario. We investigate the performance of the resulting method in identifying different assembly combinations of EEG arousals, respiratory events (apneas and hypopneas) and sleep stages, also considering different input signal montage configurations. Furthermore, we evaluate our approach using two independent datasets, assessing true-generalization effects involving local and external validation scenarios. Based on our results, we analyze and discuss our method's capabilities and its potential wide-range applicability across different settings and datasets.

Title: NL-COMM: Enhanced Video Streaming via Advanced Non-Linear Processing
Authors: Marcin Filo, George N. Katsaros, Chathura Jayawardena, Konstantinos Nikitopoulos
Abstract: With video streaming now accounting for the majority of internet traffic, wireless networks face increasing demands, especially in densely populated areas where limited spectral resources are shared among many devices. While multi-user (MU)-MIMO technology aims to improve spectral efficiency by enabling concurrent transmissions over the same frequency and time resources, traditional linear processing methods fall short of fully utilizing available channel capacity. These methods require a substantial number of antennas and RF chains, to support a much smaller number of MIMO streams, leading to increased power consumption and operational costs, even when the supported streams are of low rate. In this demo, we present NL-COMM, an advanced non-linear MIMO processing framework, demonstrated for the first time with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) user equipment (UEs) in a fully 3GPP-compliant environment. In addition, also for the first time, the audience will compare and assess the quality of live, over-the-air video transmission from four concurrently transmitting UE devices, alternating between current state-of-the-art MIMO detection algorithms and NL-COMM. Key gains of NL-COMM include improved stream quality, halving the number of required base station antennas without compromising stream quality compared to linear approaches, as well as achieving antenna overloading factors of 400\%.

Title: Design-Agnostic Distributed Timing Fault Injection Monitor With End-to-End Design Automation
Authors: Yan He, Yumin Su, Kaiyuan Yang
Abstract: Fault injection attacks induce hardware failures in circuits and exploit these faults to compromise the security of the system. It has been demonstrated that FIAs can bypass system security mechanisms, cause faulty outputs, and gain access to secret information. Certain types of FIAs can be mounted with little effort by tampering with clock signals and or the chip operating conditions. To mitigate such low cost, yet powerful attacks, we propose a fully synthesizable and distributable in situ fault injection monitor that employs a delay locked loop to track the pulsewidth of the clock. We further develop a fully automated design framework to optimize and implement the FIA monitors at any process node. Our design is fabricated and verified in 65 nm CMOS technology with a small footprint of 1500 um2. It can lock to clock frequencies from 2 MHz to 1.26 GHz while detecting all 12 types of possible clock glitches, as well as timing FIA injections via the supply voltage, electromagnetic signals, and chip temperature.

Title: A Non-autoregressive Model for Joint STT and TTS
Authors: Vishal Sunder, Brian Kingsbury, George Saon, Samuel Thomas, Slava Shechtman Hagai Aronowitz, Eric Fosler-Lussier, Luis Lastras
Abstract: In this paper, we take a step towards jointly modeling automatic speech recognition (STT) and speech synthesis (TTS) in a fully non-autoregressive way. We develop a novel multimodal framework capable of handling the speech and text modalities as input either individually or together. The proposed model can also be trained with unpaired speech or text data owing to its multimodal nature. We further propose an iterative refinement strategy to improve the STT and TTS performance of our model such that the partial hypothesis at the output can be fed back to the input of our model, thus iteratively improving both STT and TTS predictions. We show that our joint model can effectively perform both STT and TTS tasks, outperforming the STT-specific baseline in all tasks and performing competitively with the TTS-specific baseline across a wide range of evaluation metrics.

Title: Physical Layer Security in FAS-aided Wireless Powered NOMA Systems
Authors: Farshad Rostami Ghadi, Masoud Kaveh, Kai-Kit Wong, Diego Martin, Riku Jantti, Zheng Yan
Abstract: The rapid evolution of communication technologies and the emergence of sixth-generation (6G) networks have introduced unprecedented opportunities for ultra-reliable, low-latency, and energy-efficient communication. However, the integration of advanced technologies like non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and wireless powered communication networks (WPCNs) brings significant challenges, particularly in terms of energy constraints and security vulnerabilities. Traditional antenna systems and orthogonal multiple access schemes struggle to meet the increasing demands for performance and security in such environments. To address this gap, this paper investigates the impact of emerging fluid antenna systems (FAS) on the performance of physical layer security (PLS) in WPCNs. Specifically, we consider a scenario in which a transmitter, powered by a power beacon via an energy link, transmits confidential messages to legitimate FAS-aided users over information links while an external eavesdropper attempts to decode the transmitted signals. Additionally, users leverage the NOMA scheme, where the far user may also act as an internal eavesdropper. For the proposed model, we first derive the distributions of the equivalent channels at each node and subsequently obtain compact expressions for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and average secrecy capacity (ASC), using the Gaussian quadrature methods. Our results reveal that incorporating the FAS for NOMA users, instead of the TAS, enhances the performance of the proposed secure WPCN.

Title: Deep Self-Supervised Disturbance Mapping with the OPERA Sentinel-1 Radiometric Terrain Corrected SAR Backscatter Product
Authors: Harris Hardiman-Mostow, Charles Marshak, Alexander L. Handwerger
Abstract: Mapping land surface disturbances supports disaster response, resource and ecosystem management, and climate adaptation efforts. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an invaluable tool for disturbance mapping, providing consistent time-series images of the ground regardless of weather or illumination conditions. Despite SAR's potential for disturbance mapping, processing SAR data to an analysis-ready format requires expertise and significant compute resources, particularly for large-scale global analysis. In October 2023, NASA's Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA) project released the near-global Radiometric Terrain Corrected SAR backscatter from Sentinel-1 (RTC-S1) dataset, providing publicly available, analysis-ready SAR imagery. In this work, we utilize this new dataset to systematically analyze land surface disturbances. As labeling SAR data is often prohibitively time-consuming, we train a self-supervised vision transformer - which requires no labels to train - on OPERA RTC-S1 data to estimate a per-pixel distribution from the set of baseline imagery and assess disturbances when there is significant deviation from the modeled distribution. To test our model's capability and generality, we evaluate three different natural disasters - which represent high-intensity, abrupt disturbances - from three different regions of the world. Across events, our approach yields high quality delineations: F1 scores exceeding 0.6 and Areas Under the Precision-Recall Curve exceeding 0.65, consistently outperforming existing SAR disturbance methods. Our findings suggest that a self-supervised vision transformer is well-suited for global disturbance mapping and can be a valuable tool for operational, near-global disturbance monitoring, particularly when labeled data does not exist.

Title: Formalising the intentional stance 2: a coinductive approach
Authors: Simon McGregor, timorl, Nathaniel Virgo
Abstract: Given a stochastic process with inputs and outputs, how might its behaviour be related to pursuit of a goal? We model this using 'transducers', objects that capture only the external behaviour of a system and not its internal state. A companion paper summarises our results for cognitive scientists; the current paper gives formal definitions and proofs. To formalise the concept of a system that behaves as if it were pursuing a goal, we consider what happens when a transducer (a 'policy') is coupled to another transducer that comes equipped with a success condition (a 'teleo-environment'). An optimal policy is identified with a transducer that behaves as if it were perfectly rational in the pursuit of a goal; our framework also allows us to model constrained rationality. Optimal policies obey a version of Bellman's principle: a policy that's optimal in one time step will again be optimal in the next time step, but with respect to a different teleo-environment (obtained from the original one by a modified version of Bayesian filtering). This property sometimes also applies to the bounded-rational case; we give a sufficient condition. A policy is deterministic if and only if there exists a teleo-environment for which it is uniquely optimal among the set of all policies; we relate this to classical representation theorems from decision theory. This result need not hold in the bounded-rational case; we give an example related to the absent-minded driver problem. The formalism is defined using coinduction, following the style proposed by Czajka.

Title: Estimation-Aware Trajectory Optimization with Set-Valued Measurement Uncertainties
Authors: Aditya Deole, Mehran Mesbahi
Abstract: In this paper, we present an optimization-based framework for generating estimation-aware trajectories in scenarios where measurement (output) uncertainties are state-dependent and set-valued. The framework leverages the concept of regularity for set-valued output maps. Specifically, we demonstrate that, for output-regular maps, one can utilize a set-valued observability measure that is concave with respect to finite-horizon state trajectories. By maximizing this measure, optimized estimation-aware trajectories can be designed for a broad class of systems, including those with locally linearized dynamics. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we provide a representative example in the context of trajectory planning for vision-based estimation. We present an estimation-aware trajectory for an uncooperative target-tracking problem that uses a machine learning (ML)-based estimation module on an ego-satellite.

Title: Estimating Task-based Performance Bounds for Accelerated MRI Image Reconstruction Methods by Use of Learned-Ideal Observers
Authors: Kaiyan Li, Prabhat Kc, Hua Li, Kyle J. Myers, Mark A. Anastasio, Rongping Zeng
Abstract: Medical imaging systems are commonly assessed and optimized by the use of objective measures of image quality (IQ). The performance of the ideal observer (IO) acting on imaging measurements has long been advocated as a figure-of-merit to guide the optimization of imaging systems. For computed imaging systems, the performance of the IO acting on imaging measurements also sets an upper bound on task-performance that no image reconstruction method can transcend. As such, estimation of IO performance can provide valuable guidance when designing under-sampled data-acquisition techniques by enabling the identification of designs that will not permit the reconstruction of diagnostically inappropriate images for a specified task - no matter how advanced the reconstruction method is or how plausible the reconstructed images appear. The need for such analysis is urgent because of the substantial increase of medical device submissions on deep learning-based image reconstruction methods and the fact that they may produce clean images disguising the potential loss of diagnostic information when data is aggressively under-sampled. Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN) approximated IOs (CNN-IOs) was investigated for estimating the performance of data space IOs to establish task-based performance bounds for image reconstruction, under an X-ray computed tomographic (CT) context. In this work, the application of such data space CNN-IO analysis to multi-coil magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems has been explored. This study utilized stylized multi-coil sensitivity encoding (SENSE) MRI systems and deep-generated stochastic brain models to demonstrate the approach. Signal-known-statistically and background-known-statistically (SKS/BKS) binary signal detection tasks were selected to study the impact of different acceleration factors on the data space IO performance.

Title: Tessellated Linear Model for Age Prediction from Voice
Authors: Dareen Alharthi, Mahsa Zamani, Bhiksha Raj, Rita Singh
Abstract: Voice biometric tasks, such as age estimation require modeling the often complex relationship between voice features and the biometric variable. While deep learning models can handle such complexity, they typically require large amounts of accurately labeled data to perform well. Such data are often scarce for biometric tasks such as voice-based age prediction. On the other hand, simpler models like linear regression can work with smaller datasets but often fail to generalize to the underlying non-linear patterns present in the data. In this paper we propose the Tessellated Linear Model (TLM), a piecewise linear approach that combines the simplicity of linear models with the capacity of non-linear functions. TLM tessellates the feature space into convex regions and fits a linear model within each region. We optimize the tessellation and the linear models using a hierarchical greedy partitioning. We evaluated TLM on the TIMIT dataset on the task of age prediction from voice, where it outperformed state-of-the-art deep learning models.

Title: Delayed Fusion: Integrating Large Language Models into First-Pass Decoding in End-to-end Speech Recognition
Authors: Takaaki Hori, Martin Kocour, Adnan Haider, Erik McDermott, Xiaodan Zhuang
Abstract: This paper presents an efficient decoding approach for end-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E-ASR) with large language models (LLMs). Although shallow fusion is the most common approach to incorporate language models into E2E-ASR decoding, we face two practical problems with LLMs. (1) LLM inference is computationally costly. (2) There may be a vocabulary mismatch between the ASR model and the LLM. To resolve this mismatch, we need to retrain the ASR model and/or the LLM, which is at best time-consuming and in many cases not feasible. We propose "delayed fusion," which applies LLM scores to ASR hypotheses with a delay during decoding and enables easier use of pre-trained LLMs in ASR tasks. This method can reduce not only the number of hypotheses scored by the LLM but also the number of LLM inference calls. It also allows re-tokenizion of ASR hypotheses during decoding if ASR and LLM employ different tokenizations. We demonstrate that delayed fusion provides improved decoding speed and accuracy compared to shallow fusion and N-best rescoring using the LibriHeavy ASR corpus and three public LLMs, OpenLLaMA 3B & 7B and Mistral 7B.

Title: Knowledge Distillation for Image Restoration : Simultaneous Learning from Degraded and Clean Images
Authors: Yongheng Zhang, Danfeng Yan
Abstract: Model compression through knowledge distillation has seen extensive application in classification and segmentation tasks. However, its potential in image-to-image translation, particularly in image restoration, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a Simultaneous Learning Knowledge Distillation (SLKD) framework tailored for model compression in image restoration tasks. SLKD employs a dual-teacher, single-student architecture with two distinct learning strategies: Degradation Removal Learning (DRL) and Image Reconstruction Learning (IRL), simultaneously. In DRL, the student encoder learns from Teacher A to focus on removing degradation factors, guided by a novel BRISQUE extractor. In IRL, the student decoder learns from Teacher B to reconstruct clean images, with the assistance of a proposed PIQE extractor. These strategies enable the student to learn from degraded and clean images simultaneously, ensuring high-quality compression of image restoration models. Experimental results across five datasets and three tasks demonstrate that SLKD achieves substantial reductions in FLOPs and parameters, exceeding 80\%, while maintaining strong image restoration performance.

Title: Control Barrier Function-Based Safety Filters: Characterization of Undesired Equilibria, Unbounded Trajectories, and Limit Cycles
Authors: Pol Mestres, Yiting Chen, Emiliano Dall'anese, Jorge Cortés
Abstract: This paper focuses on safety filters designed based on Control Barrier Functions (CBFs): these are modifications of a nominal stabilizing controller typically utilized in safety-critical control applications to render a given subset of states forward invariant. The paper investigates the dynamical properties of the closed- loop systems, with a focus on characterizing undesirable behaviors that may emerge due to the use of CBF-based filters. These undesirable behaviors include unbounded trajectories, limit cycles, and undesired equilibria, which can be locally stable and even form a continuum. Our analysis offer the following contributions: (i) conditions under which trajectories remain bounded and (ii) conditions under which limit cycles do not exist; (iii) we show that undesired equilibria can be characterized by solving an algebraic equation, and (iv) we pro- vide examples that show that asymptotically stable undesired equilibria can exist for a large class of nominal controllers and design parameters of the safety filter (even for convex safe sets). Further, for the specific class of planar systems, (v) we provide explicit formulas for the total number of undesired equilibria and the proportion of saddle points and asymptotically stable equilibria, and (vi) in the case of linear planar systems, we present an exhaustive analysis of their global stability properties. Examples throughout the paper illustrate the results.

Title: LAVCap: LLM-based Audio-Visual Captioning using Optimal Transport
Authors: Kyeongha Rho, Hyeongkeun Lee, Valentio Iverson, Joon Son Chung
Abstract: Automated audio captioning is a task that generates textual descriptions for audio content, and recent studies have explored using visual information to enhance captioning quality. However, current methods often fail to effectively fuse audio and visual data, missing important semantic cues from each modality. To address this, we introduce LAVCap, a large language model (LLM)-based audio-visual captioning framework that effectively integrates visual information with audio to improve audio captioning performance. LAVCap employs an optimal transport-based alignment loss to bridge the modality gap between audio and visual features, enabling more effective semantic extraction. Additionally, we propose an optimal transport attention module that enhances audio-visual fusion using an optimal transport assignment map. Combined with the optimal training strategy, experimental results demonstrate that each component of our framework is effective. LAVCap outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the AudioCaps dataset, without relying on large datasets or post-processing. Code is available at this https URL.

Title: Robust UAV Path Planning with Obstacle Avoidance for Emergency Rescue
Authors: Junteng Mao, Ziye Jia, Hanzhi Gu, Chenyu Shi, Haomin Shi, Lijun He, Qihui Wu
Abstract: The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are efficient tools for diverse tasks such as electronic reconnaissance, agricultural operations and disaster relief. In the complex three-dimensional (3D) environments, the path planning with obstacle avoidance for UAVs is a significant issue for security assurance. In this paper, we construct a comprehensive 3D scenario with obstacles and no-fly zones for dynamic UAV trajectory. Moreover, a novel artificial potential field algorithm coupled with simulated annealing (APF-SA) is proposed to tackle the robust path planning problem. APF-SA modifies the attractive and repulsive potential functions and leverages simulated annealing to escape local minimum and converge to globally optimal solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that the effectiveness of APF-SA, enabling efficient autonomous path planning for UAVs with obstacle avoidance.

Title: RIS-Aided Fluid Antenna Array-Mounted UAV Networks
Authors: Li-Hsiang Shen, Yi-Hsuan Chiu
Abstract: This paper investigates reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) downlink networks with fluid antennas (FA), where RIS enables non-line-of-sight (NLoS) transmissions. Moreover, the FA is equipped on the UAV offering dynamic antenna position adjustment, enhancing spatial diversity besides UAV deployment. We aim at total downlink rate maximization while ensuring minimum user rate requirement. We consider joint optimization of active UAV beamforming, passive RIS beamforming, UAV deployment and FA position adjustment. To address the complex problem, we propose beamfomring for RIS/UAV and FA-UAV deployment (BRAUD) scheme by employing alternative optimization, successive convex approximation (SCA) and sequential rank-one constraint relaxation (SROCR) method for the decomposed subproblems. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of RIS-FA-UAV, achieving the highest rate among existing architectures without FA/UAV/RIS deployment and without proper beamforming. Moreover, BRAUD achieves the highest rate among benchmarks of drop-rank method, heuristic optimizations and conventional zero-forcing beamforming as well as random method.

Title: PAL: Prompting Analytic Learning with Missing Modality for Multi-Modal Class-Incremental Learning
Authors: Xianghu Yue, Yiming Chen, Xueyi Zhang, Xiaoxue Gao, Mengling Feng, Mingrui Lao, Huiping Zhuang, Haizhou Li
Abstract: Multi-modal class-incremental learning (MMCIL) seeks to leverage multi-modal data, such as audio-visual and image-text pairs, thereby enabling models to learn continuously across a sequence of tasks while mitigating forgetting. While existing studies primarily focus on the integration and utilization of multi-modal information for MMCIL, a critical challenge remains: the issue of missing modalities during incremental learning phases. This oversight can exacerbate severe forgetting and significantly impair model performance. To bridge this gap, we propose PAL, a novel exemplar-free framework tailored to MMCIL under missing-modality scenarios. Concretely, we devise modality-specific prompts to compensate for missing information, facilitating the model to maintain a holistic representation of the data. On this foundation, we reformulate the MMCIL problem into a Recursive Least-Squares task, delivering an analytical linear solution. Building upon these, PAL not only alleviates the inherent under-fitting limitation in analytic learning but also preserves the holistic representation of missing-modality data, achieving superior performance with less forgetting across various multi-modal incremental scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAL significantly outperforms competitive methods across various datasets, including UPMC-Food101 and N24News, showcasing its robustness towards modality absence and its anti-forgetting ability to maintain high incremental accuracy.

Title: Path Planning for a UAV Swarm Using Formation Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization
Authors: Van Truong Hoang, Manh Duong Phung
Abstract: This work addresses the path planning problem for a group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to maintain a desired formation during operation. Our approach formulates the problem as an optimization task by defining a set of fitness functions that not only ensure the formation but also include constraints for optimal and safe UAV operation. To optimize the fitness function and obtain a suboptimal path, we employ the teaching-learning-based optimization algorithm and then further enhance it with mechanisms such as mutation, elite strategy, and multi-subject combination. A number of simulations and experiments have been conducted to evaluate the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the algorithm successfully generates valid paths for the UAVs to fly in a triangular formation for an inspection task.

Title: Joint Antenna Selection and Beamforming Design for Active RIS-aided ISAC Systems
Authors: Wei Ma, Peichang Zhang, Junjie Ye, Rouyang Guan, Xiao-Peng Li, Lei Huang
Abstract: Active reconfigurable intelligent surface (A-RIS) aided integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system has been considered as a promising paradigm to improve spectrum efficiency. However, massive energy-hungry radio frequency (RF) chains hinder its large-scale deployment. To address this issue, an A-RIS-aided ISAC system with antenna selection (AS) is proposed in this work, where a target is sensed while multiple communication users are served with specifically selected antennas. Specifically, a cuckoo search-based scheme is first utilized to select the antennas associated with high-gain channels. Subsequently, with the properly selected antennas, the weighted sum-rate (WSR) of the system is optimized under the condition of radar probing power level, power budget for the A-RIS and transmitter. To solve the highly non-convex optimization problem, we develop an efficient algorithm based on weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) and fractional programming (FP). Simulation results show that the proposed AS scheme and the algorithm are effective, which reduce the number of RF chains without significant performance degradation.

Title: Artificial Intelligence, Ambient Backscatter Communication and Non-Terrestrial Networks: A 6G Commixture
Authors: Muhammad Ali Jamshed, Bushra Haq, Muhammad Ahmed Mohsin, Ali Nauman, Halim Yanikomeroglu
Abstract: The advent of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) represents a compelling response to the International Mobile Telecommunications 2030 (IMT-2030) framework, enabling the delivery of advanced, seamless connectivity that supports reliable, sustainable, and resilient communication systems. Nevertheless, the integration of NTN with Terrestrial Networks (TN) necessitates considerable alterations to the existing cellular infrastructure in order to address the challenges intrinsic to NTN implementation. Additionally, Ambient Backscatter Communication (AmBC), which utilizes ambient Radio Frequency (RF) signals to transmit data to the intended recipient by altering and reflecting these signals, exhibits considerable potential for the effective integration of NTN and TN. Furthermore, AmBC is constrained by its limitations regarding power, interference, and other related factors. In contrast, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within wireless networks demonstrates significant potential for predictive analytics through the use of extensive datasets. AI techniques enable the real-time optimization of network parameters, mitigating interference and power limitations in AmBC. These predictive models also enhance the adaptive integration of NTN and TN, driving significant improvements in network reliability and Energy Efficiency (EE). In this paper, we present a comprehensive examination of how the commixture of AI, AmBC, and NTN can facilitate the integration of NTN and TN. We also provide a thorough analysis indicating a marked enhancement in EE predicated on this triadic relationship.

Title: Dynamic Neural Style Transfer for Artistic Image Generation using VGG19
Authors: Kapil Kashyap, Mehak Garg, Sean Fargose, Sindhu Nair
Abstract: Throughout history, humans have created remark- able works of art, but artificial intelligence has only recently started to make strides in generating visually compelling art. Breakthroughs in the past few years have focused on using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to separate and manipulate the content and style of images, applying texture synthesis techniques. Nevertheless, a number of current techniques continue to encounter obstacles, including lengthy processing times, restricted choices of style images, and the inability to modify the weight ratio of styles. We proposed a neural style transfer system that can add various artistic styles to a desired image to address these constraints allowing flexible adjustments to style weight ratios and reducing processing time. The system uses the VGG19 model for feature extraction, ensuring high-quality, flexible stylization without compromising content integrity.

Title: HpC: A Calculus for Hybrid and Mobile Systems -- Full Version
Authors: Xiong Xu, Jean-Pierre Talpin, Shuling Wang, Hao Wu, Bohua Zhan, Xinxin Liu, Naijun Zhan
Abstract: Networked cybernetic and physical systems of the Internet of Things (IoT) immerse civilian and industrial infrastructures into an interconnected and dynamic web of hybrid and mobile devices. The key feature of such systems is the hybrid and tight coupling of mobile and pervasive discrete communications in a continuously evolving environment (discrete computations with predominant continuous dynamics). In the aim of ensuring the correctness and reliability of such heterogeneous infrastructures, we introduce the hybrid {\pi}-calculus (HpC), to formally capture both mobility, pervasiveness and hybridisation in infrastructures where the network topology and its communicating entities evolve continuously in the physical world. The {\pi}-calculus proposed by Robin Milner et al. is a process calculus that can model mobile communications and computations in a very elegant manner. The HpC we propose is a conservative extension of the classical {\pi}-calculus, i.e., the extension is ``minimal'', and yet describes mobility, time and physics of systems, while allowing to lift all theoretical results (e.g. bisimulation) to the context of that extension. We showcase the HpC by considering a realistic handover protocol among mobile devices.

Title: Multimodal Marvels of Deep Learning in Medical Diagnosis: A Comprehensive Review of COVID-19 Detection
Authors: Md Shofiqul Islama, Khondokar Fida Hasanc, Hasibul Hossain Shajeebd, Humayan Kabir Ranae, Md Saifur Rahmand, Md Munirul Hasanb, AKM Azadf, Ibrahim Abdullahg, Mohammad Ali Moni
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive review of the potential of multimodal deep learning (DL) in medical diagnosis, using COVID-19 as a case example. Motivated by the success of artificial intel- ligence applications during the COVID-19 pandemic, this research aims to uncover the capabilities of DL in disease screening, prediction, and classification, and to derive insights that enhance the resilience, sustainability, and inclusiveness of science, technology, and innovation systems. Adopting a systematic approach, we investigate the fundamental methodologies, data sources, preprocessing steps, and challenges encountered in various studies and implementations. We explore the architecture of deep learning models, emphasising their data-specific structures and underlying algorithms. Subsequently, we compare different deep learning strategies utilised in COVID-19 analysis, evaluating them based on methodology, data, performance, and prerequisites for future research. By examining diverse data types and diagnostic modalities, this research contributes to scientific understanding and knowledge of the multimodal application of DL and its effectiveness in diagnosis. We have implemented and analysed 11 deep learning models using COVID-19 image, text, and speech (ie, cough) data. Our analysis revealed that the MobileNet model achieved the highest accuracy of 99.97% for COVID-19 image data and 93.73% for speech data (i.e., cough). However, the BiGRU model demonstrated superior performance in COVID-19 text classification with an accuracy of 99.89%. The broader implications of this research suggest potential benefits for other domains and disciplines that could leverage deep learning techniques for image, text, and speech analysis.

Title: Intra-day Solar and Power Forecast for Optimization of Intraday Market Participation
Authors: Nelson Salazar-Peña, Adolfo Palma-Vergara, Mateo Montes, María Alejandra Vargas-Torres, Adriana Salinas, Andrés Velasco, Alejandra Tabares, Andrés González-Mancera
Abstract: The prediction of solar irradiance enhances reliability in photovoltaic (PV) solar plant generation and grid integration. In Colombia, PV plants face penalties if energy production deviates beyond governmental thresholds from intraday market offers. This research employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional-LSTM (Bi-LSTM) models, utilizing meteorological data from a PV plant in El Paso, Cesar, Colombia, to predict solar irradiance with a 6-hour horizon and 10-minute resolution. While Bi-LSTM showed superior performance, the LSTM model achieved comparable results with significantly reduced training time (6 hours versus 18 hours), making it computationally advantageous. The LSTM predictions were averaged to create an hourly resolution model, evaluated using Mean Absolute Error, Root-Mean-Square Error, Normalized Root-Mean-Square Error, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error metrics. Comparison with the Global Forecast System (GFS) revealed similar performance, with both models effectively capturing daily solar irradiance patterns. The forecast model integrates with an Object-Oriented power production model, enabling accurate energy offers in the intraday market while minimizing penalty costs.

Title: Metric Learning with Progressive Self-Distillation for Audio-Visual Embedding Learning
Authors: Donghuo Zeng, Kazushi Ikeda
Abstract: Metric learning projects samples into an embedded space, where similarities and dissimilarities are quantified based on their learned representations. However, existing methods often rely on label-guided representation learning, where representations of different modalities, such as audio and visual data, are aligned based on annotated labels. This approach tends to underutilize latent complex features and potential relationships inherent in the distributions of audio and visual data that are not directly tied to the labels, resulting in suboptimal performance in audio-visual embedding learning. To address this issue, we propose a novel architecture that integrates cross-modal triplet loss with progressive self-distillation. Our method enhances representation learning by leveraging inherent distributions and dynamically refining soft audio-visual alignments -- probabilistic alignments between audio and visual data that capture the inherent relationships beyond explicit labels. Specifically, the model distills audio-visual distribution-based knowledge from annotated labels in a subset of each batch. This self-distilled knowledge is used t

Title: SRE-Conv: Symmetric Rotation Equivariant Convolution for Biomedical Image Classification
Authors: Yuexi Du, Jiazhen Zhang, Tal Zeevi, Nicha C. Dvornek, John A. Onofrey
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are essential tools for computer vision tasks, but they lack traditionally desired properties of extracted features that could further improve model performance, e.g., rotational equivariance. Such properties are ubiquitous in biomedical images, which often lack explicit orientation. While current work largely relies on data augmentation or explicit modules to capture orientation information, this comes at the expense of increased training costs or ineffective approximations of the desired equivariance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel and efficient implementation of the Symmetric Rotation-Equivariant (SRE) Convolution (SRE-Conv) kernel, designed to learn rotation-invariant features while simultaneously compressing the model size. The SRE-Conv kernel can easily be incorporated into any CNN backbone. We validate the ability of a deep SRE-CNN to capture equivariance to rotation using the public MedMNISTv2 dataset (16 total tasks). SRE-Conv-CNN demonstrated improved rotated image classification performance accuracy on all 16 test datasets in both 2D and 3D images, all while increasing efficiency with fewer parameters and reduced memory footprint. The code is available at this https URL.

Title: Safe Control and Learning Using the Generalized Action Governor
Authors: Nan Li, Yutong Li, Ilya Kolmanovsky, Anouck Girard, H. Eric Tseng, Dimitar Filev
Abstract: This article introduces a general framework for safe control and learning based on the generalized action governor (AG). The AG is a supervisory scheme for augmenting a nominal closed-loop system with the ability of strictly handling prescribed safety constraints. In the first part of this article, we present a generalized AG methodology and analyze its key properties in a general setting. Then, we introduce tailored AG design approaches derived from the generalized methodology for linear and discrete systems. Afterward, we discuss the application of the generalized AG to facilitate safe online learning, which aims at safely evolving control parameters using real-time data to enhance control performance in uncertain systems. We present two safe learning algorithms based on, respectively, reinforcement learning and data-driven Koopman operator-based control integrated with the generalized AG to exemplify this application. Finally, we illustrate the developments with a numerical example.

Title: Modeling and Predictive Control for the Treatment of Hyperthyroidism
Authors: Tobias M. Wolff, Maylin Menzel, Johannes W. Dietrich, Matthias A. Müller
Abstract: In this work, we propose an approach to determine the dosages of antithyroid agents to treat hyperthyroid patients. Instead of relying on a trial-and-error approach as it is commonly done in clinical practice, we suggest to determine the dosages by means of a model predictive control (MPC) scheme. To this end, we first extend a mathematical model of the pituitary-thyroid feedback loop such that the intake of methimazole, a common antithyroid agent, can be considered. Second, based on the extended model, we develop an MPC scheme to determine suitable dosages. In numerical simulations, we consider scenarios in which (i) patients are affected by Graves' disease and take the medication orally and (ii) patients suffering from a life-threatening thyrotoxicosis, in which the medication is usually given intravenously. Our conceptual study suggests that determining the medication dosages by means of an MPC scheme could be a promising alternative to the currently applied trial-and-error approach.

Title: Key-Exchange Convolutional Auto-Encoder for Data Augmentation in Early Knee Osteoarthritis Detection
Authors: Zhe Wang, Aladine Chetouani, Mohamed Jarraya, Yung Hsin Chen, Yuhua Ru, Fang Chen, Fabian Bauer, Liping Zhang, Didier Hans, Rachid Jennane
Abstract: Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common musculoskeletal condition that significantly affects mobility and quality of life, particularly in elderly populations. However, training deep learning models for early KOA classification is often hampered by the limited availability of annotated medical datasets, owing to the high costs and labour-intensive nature of data labelling. Traditional data augmentation techniques, while useful, rely on simple transformations and fail to introduce sufficient diversity into the dataset. To address these challenges, we propose the Key-Exchange Convolutional Auto-Encoder (KECAE) as an innovative Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based data augmentation strategy for early KOA classification. Our model employs a convolutional autoencoder with a novel key-exchange mechanism that generates synthetic images by selectively exchanging key pathological features between X-ray images, which not only diversifies the dataset but also ensures the clinical validity of the augmented data. A hybrid loss function is introduced to supervise feature learning and reconstruction, integrating multiple components, including reconstruction, supervision, and feature separation losses. Experimental results demonstrate that the KECAE-generated data significantly improve the performance of KOA classification models, with accuracy gains of up to 1.98% across various standard and state-of-the-art architectures. Furthermore, a clinical validation study involving expert radiologists confirms the anatomical plausibility and diagnostic realism of the synthetic outputs. These findings highlight the potential of KECAE as a robust tool for augmenting medical datasets in early KOA detection.

Title: Confidence-Driven Deep Learning Framework for Early Detection of Knee Osteoarthritis
Authors: Zhe Wang, Aladine Chetouani, Yung Hsin Chen, Yuhua Ru, Fang Chen, Mohamed Jarraya, Fabian Bauer, Liping Zhang, Didier Hans, Rachid Jennane
Abstract: Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is a prevalent musculoskeletal disorder that severely impacts mobility and quality of life, particularly among older adults. Its diagnosis often relies on subjective assessments using the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading system, leading to variability in clinical evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a confidence-driven deep learning framework for early KOA detection, focusing on distinguishing KL-0 and KL-2 stages. The Siamese-based framework integrates a novel multi-level feature extraction architecture with a hybrid loss strategy. Specifically, multi-level Global Average Pooling (GAP) layers are employed to extract features from varying network depths, ensuring comprehensive feature representation, while the hybrid loss strategy partitions training samples into high-, medium-, and low-confidence subsets. Tailored loss functions are applied to improve model robustness and effectively handle uncertainty in annotations. Experimental results on the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves competitive accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, comparable to those of expert radiologists. Cohen's kappa values (k > 0.85)) confirm substantial agreement, while McNemar's test (p > 0.05) indicates no statistically significant differences between the model and radiologists. Additionally, Confidence distribution analysis reveals that the model emulates radiologists' decision-making patterns. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed approach to serve as an auxiliary diagnostic tool, enhancing early KOA detection and reducing clinical workload.

Title: Characterization of full-scale denial-of-service
Authors: Anindya Basu, Indrani Kar
Abstract: This article investigates the resilient control problem for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) with multiple sensors, where both sides of the communication channels are affected by Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. While previous work focused on characterizing Multi-Channel DoS (MCDoS), this study emphasizes the characterization of Full-Scale DoS (FSDoS). First, a partial observer technique is proposed to address the MCDoS condition. Then, an event-triggered control strategy is designed to handle FSDoS. Finally, the frequency and duration of FSDoS are analyzed to ensure the Input-to-State Stability (ISS) of the closed-loop system.

Title: VIS-MAE: An Efficient Self-supervised Learning Approach on Medical Image Segmentation and Classification
Authors: Zelong Liu, Andrew Tieu, Nikhil Patel, Georgios Soultanidis, Louisa Deyer, Ying Wang, Sean Huver, Alexander Zhou, Yunhao Mei, Zahi A. Fayad, Timothy Deyer, Xueyan Mei
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize diagnosis and segmentation in medical imaging. However, development and clinical implementation face multiple challenges including limited data availability, lack of generalizability, and the necessity to incorporate multi-modal data effectively. A foundation model, which is a large-scale pre-trained AI model, offers a versatile base that can be adapted to a variety of specific tasks and contexts. Here, we present VIsualization and Segmentation Masked AutoEncoder (VIS-MAE), novel model weights specifically designed for medical imaging. Specifically, VIS-MAE is trained on a dataset of 2.5 million unlabeled images from various modalities (CT, MR, PET,X-rays, and ultrasound), using self-supervised learning techniques. It is then adapted to classification and segmentation tasks using explicit labels. VIS-MAE has high label efficiency, outperforming several benchmark models in both in-domain and out-of-domain applications. In addition, VIS-MAE has improved label efficiency as it can achieve similar performance to other models with a reduced amount of labeled training data (50% or 80%) compared to other pre-trained weights. VIS-MAE represents a significant advancement in medical imaging AI, offering a generalizable and robust solution for improving segmentation and classification tasks while reducing the data annotation workload.

Title: Observability for Nonlinear Systems: Connecting Variational Dynamics, Lyapunov Exponents, and Empirical Gramians
Authors: Mohamad H. Kazma, Ahmad F. Taha
Abstract: Observability quantification is a key problem in dynamic network sciences. While it has been thoroughly studied for linear systems, observability quantification for nonlinear networks is less intuitive and more cumbersome. One common approach to quantify observability for nonlinear systems is via the Empirical Gramian (Empr-Gram) -- a generalized form of the Gramian of linear systems. In this paper, we produce three new results. First, we establish that a variational form of discrete-time autonomous nonlinear systems (computed via perturbing initial conditions) yields a so-called Variational Gramian (Var-Gram) that is equivalent to the classic Empr-Gram; the former being easier to compute than the latter. Via Lyapunov exponents derived from Lyapunov's direct method, the paper's second result derives connections between existing observability measures and Var-Gram. The third result demonstrates the applicability of these new notions for sensor selection/placement in nonlinear systems. Numerical case studies demonstrate these three developments and their merits.

Title: Swin transformers are robust to distribution and concept drift in endoscopy-based longitudinal rectal cancer assessment
Authors: Jorge Tapias Gomez, Aneesh Rangnekar, Hannah Williams, Hannah Thompson, Julio Garcia-Aguilar, Joshua Jesse Smith, Harini Veeraraghavan
Abstract: Endoscopic images are used at various stages of rectal cancer treatment starting from cancer screening, diagnosis, during treatment to assess response and toxicity from treatments such as colitis, and at follow up to detect new tumor or local regrowth (LR). However, subjective assessment is highly variable and can underestimate the degree of response in some patients, subjecting them to unnecessary surgery, or overestimate response that places patients at risk of disease spread. Advances in deep learning has shown the ability to produce consistent and objective response assessment for endoscopic images. However, methods for detecting cancers, regrowth, and monitoring response during the entire course of patient treatment and follow-up are lacking. This is because, automated diagnosis and rectal cancer response assessment requires methods that are robust to inherent imaging illumination variations and confounding conditions (blood, scope, blurring) present in endoscopy images as well as changes to the normal lumen and tumor during treatment. Hence, a hierarchical shifted window (Swin) transformer was trained to distinguish rectal cancer from normal lumen using endoscopy images. Swin as well as two convolutional (ResNet-50, WideResNet-50), and vision transformer (ViT) models were trained and evaluated on follow-up longitudinal images to detect LR on private dataset as well as on out-of-distribution (OOD) public colonoscopy datasets to detect pre/non-cancerous polyps. Color shifts were applied using optimal transport to simulate distribution shifts. Swin and ResNet models were similarly accurate in the in-distribution dataset. Swin was more accurate than other methods (follow-up: 0.84, OOD: 0.83) even when subject to color shifts (follow-up: 0.83, OOD: 0.87), indicating capability to provide robust performance for longitudinal cancer assessment.

Title: Carrier Aggregation Enabled MIMO-OFDM Integrated Sensing and Communication
Authors: Haotian Liu, Zhiqing Wei, Jinghui Piao, Huici Wu, Xingwang Li, Zhiyong Feng
Abstract: In the evolution towards the forthcoming era of sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication systems characterized by ubiquitous intelligence, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is in a phase of burgeoning development. However, the capabilities of communication and sensing within single frequency band fall short of meeting the escalating demands. To this end, this paper introduces a carrier aggregation (CA)-enabled multi-input multi-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) ISAC system fusing the sensing data on high and low-frequency bands by symbol-level fusion for ultimate communication experience and high-accuracy sensing. The challenges in sensing signal processing introduced by CA include the initial phase misalignment of the echo signals on high and low-frequency bands due to attenuation and radar cross section, and the fusion of the sensing data on high and low-frequency bands with different physical-layer parameters. To this end, the sensing signal processing is decomposed into two stages. In the first stage, the problem of initial phase misalignment of the echo signals on high and low-frequency bands is solved by the angle compensation, spatial filtering and cyclic cross-correlation operations. In the second stage, this paper realizes symbol-level fusion of the sensing data on high and low-frequency bands through sensing vector rearrangement and cyclic prefix adjustment operations, thereby obtaining high-precision sensing performance. Then, the closed-form communication mutual information (MI) and sensing Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the proposed ISAC system are derived to explore the theoretical performance bound with CA. Simulation results validate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed ISAC system.

Title: VBIM-Net: Variational Born Iterative Network for Inverse Scattering Problems
Authors: Ziqing Xing, Zhaoyang Zhang, Zirui Chen, Yusong Wang, Haoran Ma, Zhun Wei
Abstract: Recently, studies have shown the potential of integrating field-type iterative methods with deep learning (DL) techniques in solving inverse scattering problems (ISPs). In this article, we propose a novel Variational Born Iterative Network, namely, VBIM-Net, to solve the full-wave ISPs with significantly improved structural rationality and inversion quality. The proposed VBIM-Net emulates the alternating updates of the total electric field and the contrast in the variational Born iterative method (VBIM) by multiple layers of subnetworks. We embed the analytical calculation of the contrast variation into each subnetwork, converting the scattered field residual into an approximate contrast variation and then enhancing it by a U-Net, thus avoiding the requirement of matched measurement dimension and grid resolution as in existing approaches. The total field and contrast of each layer's output is supervised in the loss function of VBIM-Net, imposing soft physical constraints on the variables in the subnetworks, which benefits the model's performance. In addition, we design a training scheme with extra noise to enhance the model's stability. Extensive numerical results on synthetic and experimental data both verify the inversion quality, generalization ability, and robustness of the proposed VBIM-Net. This work may provide some new inspiration for the design of efficient field-type DL schemes.

Title: Geometric Distortion Guided Transformer for Omnidirectional Image Super-Resolution
Authors: Cuixin Yang, Rongkang Dong, Jun Xiao, Cong Zhang, Kin-Man Lam, Fei Zhou, Guoping Qiu
Abstract: As virtual and augmented reality applications gain popularity, omnidirectional image (ODI) super-resolution has become increasingly important. Unlike 2D plain images that are formed on a plane, ODIs are projected onto spherical surfaces. Applying established image super-resolution methods to ODIs, therefore, requires performing equirectangular projection (ERP) to map the ODIs onto a plane. ODI super-resolution needs to take into account geometric distortion resulting from ERP. However, without considering such geometric distortion of ERP images, previous deep-learning-based methods only utilize a limited range of pixels and may easily miss self-similar textures for reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce a novel Geometric Distortion Guided Transformer for Omnidirectional image Super-Resolution (GDGT-OSR). Specifically, a distortion modulated rectangle-window self-attention mechanism, integrated with deformable self-attention, is proposed to better perceive the distortion and thus involve more self-similar textures. Distortion modulation is achieved through a newly devised distortion guidance generator that produces guidance by exploiting the variability of distortion across latitudes. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic feature aggregation scheme to adaptively fuse the features from different self-attention modules. We present extensive experimental results on public datasets and show that the new GDGT-OSR outperforms methods in existing literature.

Title: CMRxRecon2024: A Multi-Modality, Multi-View K-Space Dataset Boosting Universal Machine Learning for Accelerated Cardiac MRI
Authors: Zi Wang, Fanwen Wang, Chen Qin, Jun Lyu, Cheng Ouyang, Shuo Wang, Yan Li, Mengyao Yu, Haoyu Zhang, Kunyuan Guo, Zhang Shi, Qirong Li, Ziqiang Xu, Yajing Zhang, Hao Li, Sha Hua, Binghua Chen, Longyu Sun, Mengting Sun, Qin Li, Ying-Hua Chu, Wenjia Bai, Jing Qin, Xiahai Zhuang, Claudia Prieto, Alistair Young, Michael Markl, He Wang, Lianming Wu, Guang Yang, Xiaobo Qu, Chengyan Wang
Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as a clinically gold-standard technique for diagnosing cardiac diseases, thanks to its ability to provide diverse information with multiple modalities and anatomical views. Accelerated cardiac MRI is highly expected to achieve time-efficient and patient-friendly imaging, and then advanced image reconstruction approaches are required to recover high-quality, clinically interpretable images from undersampled measurements. However, the lack of publicly available cardiac MRI k-space dataset in terms of both quantity and diversity has severely hindered substantial technological progress, particularly for data-driven artificial intelligence. Here, we provide a standardized, diverse, and high-quality CMRxRecon2024 dataset to facilitate the technical development, fair evaluation, and clinical transfer of cardiac MRI reconstruction approaches, towards promoting the universal frameworks that enable fast and robust reconstructions across different cardiac MRI protocols in clinical practice. To the best of our knowledge, the CMRxRecon2024 dataset is the largest and most protocal-diverse publicly available cardiac k-space dataset. It is acquired from 330 healthy volunteers, covering commonly used modalities, anatomical views, and acquisition trajectories in clinical cardiac MRI workflows. Besides, an open platform with tutorials, benchmarks, and data processing tools is provided to facilitate data usage, advanced method development, and fair performance evaluation.

Title: Collaborative Secret and Covert Communications for Multi-User Multi-Antenna Uplink UAV Systems: Design and Optimization
Authors: Jinpeng Xu, Lin Bai, Xin Xie, Lin Zhou
Abstract: Motivated by diverse secure requirements of multi-user in UAV systems, we propose a collaborative secret and covert transmission method for multi-antenna ground users to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications. Specifically, based on the power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), two ground users with distinct security requirements, named Bob and Carlo, superimpose their signals and transmit the combined signal to the UAV named Alice. An adversary Willie attempts to simultaneously eavesdrop Bob's confidential message and detect whether Carlo is transmitting or not. We derive close-form expressions of the secrecy connection probability (SCP) and the covert connection probability (CCP) to evaluate the link reliability for wiretap and covert transmissions, respectively. Furthermore, we bound the secrecy outage probability (SOP) from Bob to Alice and the detection error probability (DEP) of Willie to evaluate the link security for wiretap and covert transmissions, respectively. To characterize the theoretical benchmark of the above model, we formulate a weighted multi-objective optimization problem to maximize the average of secret and covert transmission rates subject to constraints SOP, DEP, the beamformers of Bob and Carlo, and UAV trajectory parameters. To solve the optimization problem, we propose an iterative optimization algorithm using successive convex approximation and block coordinate descent (SCA-BCD) methods. Our results reveal the influence of design parameters of the system on the wiretap and covert rates, analytically and numerically. In summary, our study fills the gaps in joint secret and covert transmission for multi-user multi-antenna uplink UAV communications and provides insights to construct such systems.

Title: Enhanced Masked Image Modeling to Avoid Model Collapse on Multi-modal MRI Datasets
Authors: Linxuan Han, Sa Xiao, Zimeng Li, Haidong Li, Xiuchao Zhao, Yeqing Han, Fumin Guo, Xin Zhou
Abstract: Multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides information of lesions for computer-aided diagnosis from different views. Deep learning algorithms are suitable for identifying specific anatomical structures, segmenting lesions, and classifying diseases. Manual labels are limited due to the high expense, which hinders further improvement of accuracy. Self-supervised learning, particularly masked image modeling (MIM), has shown promise in utilizing unlabeled data. However, we spot model collapse when applying MIM to multi-modal MRI datasets. The performance of downstream tasks does not see any improvement following the collapsed model. To solve model collapse, we analyze and address it in two types: complete collapse and dimensional collapse. We find complete collapse occurs because the collapsed loss value in multi-modal MRI datasets falls below the normally converged loss value. Based on this, the hybrid mask pattern (HMP) masking strategy is introduced to elevate the collapsed loss above the normally converged loss value and avoid complete collapse. Additionally, we reveal that dimensional collapse stems from insufficient feature uniformity in MIM. We mitigate dimensional collapse by introducing the pyramid barlow twins (PBT) module as an explicit regularization method. Overall, we construct the enhanced MIM (E-MIM) with HMP and PBT module to avoid model collapse multi-modal MRI. Experiments are conducted on three multi-modal MRI datasets to validate the effectiveness of our approach in preventing both types of model collapse. By preventing model collapse, the training of the model becomes more stable, resulting in a decent improvement in performance for segmentation and classification tasks.

Title: Quantum Annealing based Power Grid Partitioning for Parallel Simulation
Authors: Carsten Hartmann, Junjie Zhang, Carlos D. Gonzalez Calaza, Thiemo Pesch, Kristel Michielsen, Andrea Benigni
Abstract: Graph partitioning has many applications in powersystems from decentralized state estimation to parallel simulation. Focusing on parallel simulation, optimal grid partitioning minimizes the idle time caused by different simulation times for the sub-networks and their components and reduces the overhead required to simulate the cuts. Partitioning a graph into two parts such that, for example, the cut is minimal and the subgraphs have equal size is an NP-hard problem. In this paper we show how optimal partitioning of a graph can be obtained using quantum annealing (QA). We show how to map the requirements for optimal splitting to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation and test the proposed formulation using a current D-Wave QPU. We show that the necessity to find an embedding of the QUBO on current D-Wave QPUs limits the problem size to under 200 buses and notably affects the time-to-solution. We finally discuss the implications on near-term implementation of QA in combination to traditional CPU or GPU based simulation.

Title: Toward Any-to-Any Emotion Voice Conversion using Disentangled Diffusion Framework
Authors: Hsing-Hang Chou, Yun-Shao Lin, Ching-Chin Sung, Yu Tsao, Chi-Chun Lee
Abstract: Emotional Voice Conversion (EVC) aims to modify the emotional expression of speech for various applications, such as human-machine interaction. Previous deep learning-based approaches using generative adversarial networks and autoencoder models have shown promise but suffer from quality degradation and limited emotion control. To address these issues, a novel diffusion-based EVC framework with disentangled loss and expressive guidance is proposed. Our method separates speaker and emotional features to maintain speech quality while improving emotional expressiveness. Tested on real-world and acted-out datasets, the approach achieved significant improvements in emotion classification accuracy for both in-the-wild and act-out datasets and showed reduced distortion compared to state-of-the-art models.

Title: Target Speaker ASR with Whisper
Authors: Alexander Polok, Dominik Klement, Matthew Wiesner, Sanjeev Khudanpur, Jan Černocký, Lukáš Burget
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to enable the use of large, single-speaker ASR models, such as Whisper, for target speaker ASR. The key claim of this method is that it is much easier to model relative differences among speakers by learning to condition on frame-level diarization outputs than to learn the space of all speaker embeddings. We find that adding even a single bias term per diarization output type before the first transformer block can transform single-speaker ASR models into target-speaker ASR models. Our approach also supports speaker-attributed ASR by sequentially generating transcripts for each speaker in a diarization output. This simplified method outperforms baseline speech separation and diarization cascade by 12.9 % absolute ORC-WER on the NOTSOFAR-1 dataset.

Title: Editing Music with Melody and Text: Using ControlNet for Diffusion Transformer
Authors: Siyuan Hou, Shansong Liu, Ruibin Yuan, Wei Xue, Ying Shan, Mangsuo Zhao, Chao Zhang
Abstract: Despite the significant progress in controllable music generation and editing, challenges remain in the quality and length of generated music due to the use of Mel-spectrogram representations and UNet-based model structures. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach using a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) augmented with an additional control branch using ControlNet. This allows for long-form and variable-length music generation and editing controlled by text and melody prompts. For more precise and fine-grained melody control, we introduce a novel top-$k$ constant-Q Transform representation as the melody prompt, reducing ambiguity compared to previous representations (e.g., chroma), particularly for music with multiple tracks or a wide range of pitch values. To effectively balance the control signals from text and melody prompts, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy that progressively masks the melody prompt, resulting in a more stable training process. Experiments have been performed on text-to-music generation and music-style transfer tasks using open-source instrumental recording data. The results demonstrate that by extending StableAudio, a pre-trained text-controlled DiT model, our approach enables superior melody-controlled editing while retaining good text-to-music generation performance. These results outperform a strong MusicGen baseline in terms of both text-based generation and melody preservation for editing. Audio examples can be found at this https URL.

Title: Towards optimal algorithms for the recovery of low-dimensional models with linear rates
Authors: Yann Traonmilin (IMB), Jean François Aujol (IMB), Antoine Guennec (IMB)
Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering elements of a low-dimensional model from linear measurements. From signal and image processing to inverse problems in data science, this question has been at the center of many applications. Lately, with the success of models and methods relying on deep neural networks leading to non-convex formulations, traditional convex variational approaches have shown their limits. Furthermore, the multiplication of algorithms and recovery results makes identifying the best methods a complex task. In this article, we study recovery with a class of widely used algorithms without considering any underlying functional. This result leads to a class of projected gradient descent algorithms that recover a given low-dimensional with linear rates. The obtained rates decouple the impact of the quality of the measurements with respect to the model from its intrinsic complexity. As a consequence, we can directly measure the performance of this class of projected gradient descents through a restricted Lipschitz constant of the projection. By optimizing this constant, we define optimal algorithms. Our general approach provides an optimality result in the case of sparse recovery. Moreover, we uncover underlying linear rates of convergence for some ''plug and play'' imaging methods relying on deep priors by interpreting our results in this context, thus linking low-dimensional recovery and recovery with deep priors under a unified theory, validated by experiments on synthetic and real data.

Title: Lateral String Stability in Autonomous & Connected Vehicle Platoons
Authors: Neelkamal Somisetty, Swaroop Darbha
Abstract: This paper addresses the lateral control of Autonomous and Connected Vehicles (ACVs) in a platoon executing an Emergency Lane Change (ELC) maneuver. These maneuvers are typically triggered by emergency signals from the front or rear of the platoon in response to the need to avoid obstacles or allow other vehicles to pass. The study assumes that ACVs maintain reliable connectivity, enabling each following vehicle to access GPS position traces of both the lead and immediately preceding vehicles in the platoon. We demonstrate that lateral string stability in the ACV platoon can be achieved using communicated information solely from the lead and preceding vehicles. Additionally, we present a lateral control framework for ACVs, which helps track a discretized preview of the trajectory constructed from the communicated data. This framework involves constructing two distinct trajectories based on the preview data from the lead and preceding vehicles, calculating the associated errors and lateral control actions for each, and then integrating these to generate a steering command. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed lateral control scheme.

Title: Sparsity-Aware Distributed Learning for Gaussian Processes with Linear Multiple Kernel
Authors: Richard Cornelius Suwandi, Zhidi Lin, Feng Yin, Zhiguo Wang, Sergios Theodoridis
Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) stand as crucial tools in machine learning and signal processing, with their effectiveness hinging on kernel design and hyper-parameter optimization. This paper presents a novel GP linear multiple kernel (LMK) and a generic sparsity-aware distributed learning framework to optimize the hyper-parameters. The newly proposed grid spectral mixture product (GSMP) kernel is tailored for multi-dimensional data, effectively reducing the number of hyper-parameters while maintaining good approximation capability. We further demonstrate that the associated hyper-parameter optimization of this kernel yields sparse solutions. To exploit the inherent sparsity of the solutions, we introduce the Sparse LInear Multiple Kernel Learning (SLIM-KL) framework. The framework incorporates a quantized alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) scheme for collaborative learning among multiple agents, where the local optimization problem is solved using a distributed successive convex approximation (DSCA) algorithm. SLIM-KL effectively manages large-scale hyper-parameter optimization for the proposed kernel, simultaneously ensuring data privacy and minimizing communication costs. Theoretical analysis establishes convergence guarantees for the learning framework, while experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate the superior prediction performance and efficiency of our proposed methods.

Title: USED: Universal Speaker Extraction and Diarization
Authors: Junyi Ao, Mehmet Sinan Yıldırım, Ruijie Tao, Meng Ge, Shuai Wang, Yanmin Qian, Haizhou Li
Abstract: Speaker extraction and diarization are two enabling techniques for real-world speech applications. Speaker extraction aims to extract a target speaker's voice from a speech mixture, while speaker diarization demarcates speech segments by speaker, annotating `who spoke when'. Previous studies have typically treated the two tasks independently. In practical applications, it is more meaningful to have knowledge about `who spoke what and when', which is captured by the two tasks. The two tasks share a similar objective of disentangling speakers. Speaker extraction operates in the frequency domain, whereas diarization is in the temporal domain. It is logical to believe that speaker activities obtained from speaker diarization can benefit speaker extraction, while the extracted speech offers more accurate speaker activity detection than the speech mixture. In this paper, we propose a unified model called Universal Speaker Extraction and Diarization (USED) to address output inconsistency and scenario mismatch issues. It is designed to manage speech mixtures with varying overlap ratios and variable number of speakers. We show that the USED model significantly outperforms the competitive baselines for speaker extraction and diarization tasks on LibriMix and SparseLibriMix datasets. We further validate the diarization performance on CALLHOME, a dataset based on real recordings, and experimental results indicate that our model surpasses recently proposed approaches.

Title: SD-Eval: A Benchmark Dataset for Spoken Dialogue Understanding Beyond Words
Authors: Junyi Ao, Yuancheng Wang, Xiaohai Tian, Dekun Chen, Jun Zhang, Lu Lu, Yuxuan Wang, Haizhou Li, Zhizheng Wu
Abstract: Speech encompasses a wealth of information, including but not limited to content, paralinguistic, and environmental information. This comprehensive nature of speech significantly impacts communication and is crucial for human-computer interaction. Chat-Oriented Large Language Models (LLMs), known for their general-purpose assistance capabilities, have evolved to handle multi-modal inputs, including speech. Although these models can be adept at recognizing and analyzing speech, they often fall short of generating appropriate responses. We argue that this is due to the lack of principles on task definition and model development, which requires open-source datasets and metrics suitable for model evaluation. To bridge the gap, we present SD-Eval, a benchmark dataset aimed at multidimensional evaluation of spoken dialogue understanding and generation. SD-Eval focuses on paralinguistic and environmental information and includes 7,303 utterances, amounting to 8.76 hours of speech data. The data is aggregated from eight public datasets, representing four perspectives: emotion, accent, age, and background sound. To assess the SD-Eval benchmark dataset, we implement three different models and construct a training set following a process similar to that of SD-Eval. The training set contains 1,052.72 hours of speech data and 724.4k utterances. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation using objective evaluation methods (e.g. BLEU and ROUGE), subjective evaluations and LLM-based metrics for the generated responses. Models conditioned with paralinguistic and environmental information outperform their counterparts in both objective and subjective measures. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that LLM-based metrics show a higher correlation with human evaluation compared to traditional metrics. We open-source SD-Eval at this https URL.

Title: MVGT: A Multi-view Graph Transformer Based on Spatial Relations for EEG Emotion Recognition
Authors: Yanjie Cui, Xiaohong Liu, Jing Liang, Yamin Fu
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG), a technique that records electrical activity from the scalp using electrodes, plays a vital role in affective computing. However, fully utilizing the multi-domain characteristics of EEG signals remains a significant challenge. Traditional single-perspective analyses often fail to capture the complex interplay of temporal, frequency, and spatial dimensions in EEG data. To address this, we introduce a multi-view graph transformer (MVGT) based on spatial relations that integrates information across three domains: temporal dynamics from continuous series, frequency features extracted from frequency bands, and inter-channel relationships captured through several spatial encodings. This comprehensive approach allows model to capture the nuanced properties inherent in EEG signals, enhancing its flexibility and representational power. Evaluation on publicly available datasets demonstrates that MVGT surpasses state-of-the-art methods in performance. The results highlight its ability to extract multi-domain information and effectively model inter-channel relationships, showcasing its potential for EEG-based emotion recognition tasks.

Title: reBEN: Refined BigEarthNet Dataset for Remote Sensing Image Analysis
Authors: Kai Norman Clasen, Leonard Hackel, Tom Burgert, Gencer Sumbul, Begüm Demir, Volker Markl
Abstract: This paper presents refined BigEarthNet (reBEN) that is a large-scale, multi-modal remote sensing dataset constructed to support deep learning (DL) studies for remote sensing image analysis. The reBEN dataset consists of 549,488 pairs of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image patches. To construct reBEN, we initially consider the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 tiles used to construct the BigEarthNet dataset and then divide them into patches of size 1200 m x 1200 m. We apply atmospheric correction to the Sentinel-2 patches using the latest version of the sen2cor tool, resulting in higher-quality patches compared to those present in BigEarthNet. Each patch is then associated with a pixel-level reference map and scene-level multi-labels. This makes reBEN suitable for pixel- and scene-based learning tasks. The labels are derived from the most recent CORINE Land Cover (CLC) map of 2018 by utilizing the 19-class nomenclature as in BigEarthNet. The use of the most recent CLC map results in overcoming the label noise present in BigEarthNet. Furthermore, we introduce a new geographical-based split assignment algorithm that significantly reduces the spatial correlation among the train, validation, and test sets with respect to those present in BigEarthNet. This increases the reliability of the evaluation of DL models. To minimize the DL model training time, we introduce software tools that convert the reBEN dataset into a DL-optimized data format. In our experiments, we show the potential of reBEN for multi-modal multi-label image classification problems by considering several state-of-the-art DL models. The pre-trained model weights, associated code, and complete dataset are available at this https URL.

Title: Modeling Time-Variant Responses of Optical Compressors with Selective State Space Models
Authors: Riccardo Simionato, Stefano Fasciani
Abstract: This paper presents a method for modeling optical dynamic range compressors using deep neural networks with Selective State Space models. The proposed approach surpasses previous methods based on recurrent layers by employing a Selective State Space block to encode the input audio. It features a refined technique integrating Feature-wise Linear Modulation and Gated Linear Units to adjust the network dynamically, conditioning the compression's attack and release phases according to external parameters. The proposed architecture is well-suited for low-latency and real-time applications, crucial in live audio processing. The method has been validated on the analog optical compressors TubeTech CL 1B and Teletronix LA-2A, which possess distinct characteristics. Evaluation is performed using quantitative metrics and subjective listening tests, comparing the proposed method with other state-of-the-art models. Results show that our black-box modeling methods outperform all others, achieving accurate emulation of the compression process for both seen and unseen settings during training. We further show a correlation between this accuracy and the sampling density of the control parameters in the dataset and identify settings with fast attack and slow release as the most challenging to emulate.

Title: Sines, Transient, Noise Neural Modeling of Piano Notes
Authors: Riccardo Simionato, Stefano Fasciani
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for emulating piano sounds. We propose to exploit the sines, transient, and noise decomposition to design a differentiable spectral modeling synthesizer replicating piano notes. Three sub-modules learn these components from piano recordings and generate the corresponding harmonic, transient, and noise signals. Splitting the emulation into three independently trainable models reduces the modeling tasks' complexity. The quasi-harmonic content is produced using a differentiable sinusoidal model guided by physics-derived formulas, whose parameters are automatically estimated from audio recordings. The noise sub-module uses a learnable time-varying filter, and the transients are generated using a deep convolutional network. From singular notes, we emulate the coupling between different keys in trichords with a convolutional-based network. Results show the model matches the partial distribution of the target while predicting the energy in the higher part of the spectrum presents more challenges. The energy distribution in the spectra of the transient and noise components is accurate overall. While the model is more computationally and memory efficient, perceptual tests reveal limitations in accurately modeling the attack phase of notes. Despite this, it generally achieves perceptual accuracy in emulating single notes and trichords.

Title: AudioBERT: Audio Knowledge Augmented Language Model
Authors: Hyunjong Ok, Suho Yoo, Jaeho Lee
Abstract: Recent studies have identified that language models, pretrained on text-only datasets, often lack elementary visual knowledge, \textit{e.g.,} colors of everyday objects. Motivated by this observation, we ask whether a similar shortcoming exists in terms of the \textit{auditory} knowledge. To answer this question, we construct a new dataset called AuditoryBench, which consists of two novel tasks for evaluating auditory knowledge. Based on our analysis using the benchmark, we find that language models also suffer from a severe lack of auditory knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose AudioBERT, a novel method to augment the auditory knowledge of BERT through a retrieval-based approach. First, we detect auditory knowledge spans in prompts to query our retrieval model efficiently. Then, we inject audio knowledge into BERT and switch on low-rank adaptation for effective adaptation when audio knowledge is required. Our experiments demonstrate that AudioBERT is quite effective, achieving superior performance on the AuditoryBench. The dataset and code are available at \bulurl{this https URL}.

Title: Frechet Music Distance: A Metric For Generative Symbolic Music Evaluation
Authors: Jan Retkowski, Jakub Stępniak, Mateusz Modrzejewski
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the Frechet Music Distance (FMD), a novel evaluation metric for generative symbolic music models, inspired by the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) in computer vision and Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) in generative audio. FMD calculates the distance between distributions of reference and generated symbolic music embeddings, capturing abstract musical features. We validate FMD across several datasets and models. Results indicate that FMD effectively differentiates model quality, providing a domain-specific metric for evaluating symbolic music generation, and establishing a reproducible standard for future research in symbolic music modeling.

Title: ERGNN: Spectral Graph Neural Network With Explicitly-Optimized Rational Graph Filters
Authors: Guoming Li, Jian Yang, Shangsong Liang
Abstract: Approximation-based spectral graph neural networks, which construct graph filters with function approximation, have shown substantial performance in graph learning tasks. Despite their great success, existing works primarily employ polynomial approximation to construct the filters, whereas another superior option, namely ration approximation, remains underexplored. Although a handful of prior works have attempted to deploy the rational approximation, their implementations often involve intensive computational demands or still resort to polynomial approximations, hindering full potential of the rational graph filters. To address the issues, this paper introduces ERGNN, a novel spectral GNN with explicitly-optimized rational filter. ERGNN adopts a unique two-step framework that sequentially applies the numerator filter and the denominator filter to the input signals, thus streamlining the model paradigm while enabling explicit optimization of both numerator and denominator of the rational filter. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of ERGNN over state-of-the-art methods, establishing it as a practical solution for deploying rational-based GNNs.

Title: VITA-1.5: Towards GPT-4o Level Real-Time Vision and Speech Interaction
Authors: Chaoyou Fu, Haojia Lin, Xiong Wang, Yi-Fan Zhang, Yunhang Shen, Xiaoyu Liu, Yangze Li, Zuwei Long, Heting Gao, Ke Li, Long Ma, Xiawu Zheng, Rongrong Ji, Xing Sun, Caifeng Shan, Ran He
Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have typically focused on integrating visual and textual modalities, with less emphasis placed on the role of speech in enhancing interaction. However, speech plays a crucial role in multimodal dialogue systems, and implementing high-performance in both vision and speech tasks remains a significant challenge due to the fundamental modality differences. In this paper, we propose a carefully designed multi-stage training methodology that progressively trains LLM to understand both visual and speech information, ultimately enabling fluent vision and speech interaction. Our approach not only preserves strong vision-language capacity, but also enables efficient speech-to-speech dialogue capabilities without separate ASR and TTS modules, significantly accelerating multimodal end-to-end response speed. By comparing our method against state-of-the-art counterparts across benchmarks for image, video, and speech tasks, we demonstrate that our model is equipped with both strong visual and speech capabilities, making near real-time vision and speech interaction.

Despite their adaptability and efficiency, LLMs have not been extensively explored for signal processing tasks, particularly in the domain of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) interference monitoring. GNSS interference monitoring is essential to ensure the reliability of vehicle localization on roads, a critical requirement for numerous applications. However, GNSS-based positioning is vulnerable to interference from jamming devices, which can compromise its accuracy. The primary objective is to identify, classify, and mitigate these interferences. Interpreting GNSS snapshots and the associated interferences presents significant challenges due to the inherent complexity, including multipath effects, diverse interference types, varying sensor characteristics, and satellite constellations. In this paper, we extract features from a large GNSS dataset and employ LLaVA to retrieve relevant information from an extensive knowledge base. We employ prompt engineering to interpret the interferences and environmental factors, and utilize t-SNE to analyze the feature embeddings. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of visual and logical reasoning within the GNSS context. Furthermore, our pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning models in interference classification tasks.
