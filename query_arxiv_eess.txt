Title: Efficient Beamforming Optimization for STAR-RIS-Assisted Communications: A Gradient-Based Meta Learning Approach
Authors: Dongdong Yang, Bin Li, Jiguang He, Yicheng Yan, Xiaoyu Zhang, Chongwen Huang
Abstract: Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) has emerged as a promising technology to realize full-space coverage and boost spectral efficiency in next-generation wireless networks. Yet, the joint design of the base station precoding matrix as well as the STAR-RIS transmission and reflection coefficient matrices leads to a high-dimensional, strongly nonconvex, and NP-hard optimization problem. Conventional alternating optimization (AO) schemes typically involve repeated large-scale matrix inversion operations, resulting in high computational complexity and poor scalability, while existing deep learning approaches often rely on expensive pre-training and large network models. In this paper, we develop a gradient-based meta learning (GML) framework that directly feeds optimization gradients into lightweight neural networks, thereby removing the need for pre-training and enabling fast adaptation. Specifically, we design dedicated GML-based schemes for both independent-phase and coupled-phase STAR-RIS models, effectively handling their respective amplitude and phase constraints while achieving weighted sum-rate performance very close to that of AO-based benchmarks. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, for both phase models, the proposed methods substantially reduce computational overhead, with complexity growing nearly linearly when the number of BS antennas and STAR-RIS elements grows, and yielding up to 10 times runtime speedup over AO, which confirms the scalability and practicality of the proposed GML method for large-scale STAR-RIS-assisted communications.

Title: Continual Learning for Acoustic Event Classification
Authors: Yang Xiao
Abstract: Continuously learning new classes without catastrophic forgetting is a challenging problem for on-device acoustic event classification given the restrictions on computation resources (e.g., model size, running memory). To alleviate such an issue, we propose two novel diversity-aware incremental learning method for Spoken Keyword Spotting and Environmental Sound Classification. Our method selects the historical data for the training by measuring the per-sample classification uncertainty. For the Spoken Keyword Spotting application, the proposed RK approach introduces a diversity-aware sampler to select a diverse set from historical and incoming keywords by calculating classification uncertainty. As a result, the RK approach can incrementally learn new tasks without forgetting prior knowledge. Besides, the RK approach also proposes data augmentation and knowledge distillation loss function for efficient memory management on the edge device. For the Environmental Sound Classification application, we measure the uncertainty by observing how the classification probability of data fluctuates against the parallel perturbations added to the classifier embedding. In this way, the computation cost can be significantly reduced compared with adding perturbation to the raw data. Experimental results show that the proposed RK approach achieves 4.2% absolute improvement in terms of average accuracy over the best baseline on Google Speech Command dataset with less required memory. Experimental results on the DCASE 2019 Task 1 and ESC-50 dataset show that our proposed method outperforms baseline continual learning methods on classification accuracy and computational efficiency, indicating our method can efficiently and incrementally learn new classes without the catastrophic forgetting problem for on-device environmental sound classification

Title: Review of Power Electronic Solutions for Dielectric Barrier Discharge Applications
Authors: Hyeongmeen Baik, Jinia Roy
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive review of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) power supply topologies, aiming to bridge the gap between DBD applications and power electronics design. Two key aspects are examined: the dependence of the DBD electrical model on reactor geometry, and application-driven requirements for injected waveform characteristics, including shapes, voltage amplitude, frequency, and modulation techniques. On this basis, the paper systematically reviews two major categories of power supplies: sinusoidal types comprising transformerless and transformer-based resonant inverters, and pulsed power supplies (PPSs). The review summarizes performance trade-offs, highlights untested topologies and emerging applications, and offers guidance for advancing high-performance DBD power supply design for next-generation systems.

Title: Deep Learning Surrogate for Fast CIR Prediction in Reactive Molecular Diffusion Advection Channels
Authors: Meysam Ghanbari, Mohammad Taghi Dabiri, Mazen Hasna, Tanvir Alam, Khalid Qaraqe
Abstract: Accurate channel impulse response (CIR) modeling in molecular communication (MC) often requires solving coupled reactive diffusion-advection equations, which is computationally expensive for large parameter sweeps or design loops. We develop a deep-learning surrogate for a three-dimensional duct MC channel with reactive diffusion-advection transport and reversible ligand-receptor binding on a finite ring receiver. Using a physics-based partial differential equation (PDE)-ordinary differential equation (ODE) model, we generate a large CIR dataset across broad transport, reaction, and geometric ranges and train a neural network that maps these parameters directly to the CIR. On an independent test set, the surrogate closely matches reference CIRs both qualitatively and quantitatively: the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) shows that 90% of test channels are predicted with error below 0.15, with only weak dependence on individual parameters. The surrogate therefore offers an accurate and computationally efficient replacement for repeated PDE-based CIR evaluations in MC system analysis and design.

Title: Robust Beamforming for Pinching-Antenna Systems
Authors: Mingjun Sun, Chongjun Ouyang, Shaochuan Wu, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: Pinching-antenna system (PASS) mitigates large-scale path loss by enabling flexible placement of pinching antennas (PAs) along the dielectric waveguide. However, most existing studies assume perfect channel state information (CSI), overlooking the impact of channel uncertainty. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a robust beamforming framework for both lossy and lossless waveguides. For baseband beamforming, the lossy case yields an second-order cone programming-based solution, while the lossless case admits a closed-form solution via maximum ratio transmission. The PAs' positions in both cases are optimized through the Gauss-Seidel-based method. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate that PASS exhibits superior robustness against channel uncertainty compared with conventional fixed-antenna systems. Notably, its worst-case achievable rate can even exceed the fixed-antenna baseline under perfect CSI.

Title: AI Assisted Next Gen Outdoor Optical Networks: Camera Sensing for Monitoring and User Localization
Authors: Meysam Ghanbari, Mohammad Taghi Dabiri, Rula Ammuri, Mazen Hasna, Khalid Qaraqe
Abstract: We consider outdoor optical access points (OAPs), which, enabled by recent advances in metasurface technology, have attracted growing interest. While OAPs promise high data rates and strong physical-layer security, practical deployments still expose vulnerabilities and misuse patterns that necessitate a dedicated monitoring layer - the focus of this work. We therefore propose a user positioning and monitoring system that infers locations from spatial intensity measurements on a photodetector (PD) array. Specifically, our hybrid approach couples an optics-informed forward model and sparse, model-based inversion with a lightweight data-driven calibration stage, yielding high accuracy at low computational cost. This design preserves the interpretability and stability of model-based reconstruction while leveraging learning to absorb residual nonidealities and device-specific distortions. Under identical hardware and training conditions (both with 5 x 10^5 samples), the hybrid method attains consistently lower mean-squared error than a generic deep-learning baseline while using substantially less training time and compute. Accuracy improves with array resolution and saturates around 60 x 60-80 x 80, indicating a favorable accuracy-complexity trade-off for real-time deployment. The resulting position estimates can be cross-checked with real-time network logs to enable continuous monitoring, anomaly detection (e.g., potential eavesdropping), and access control in outdoor optical access networks.

Title: CV Quantum Communications with Angular Rejection Filtering: Modeling and Security Analysis
Authors: Mohammad Taghi Dabiri, Meysam Ghanbari, Rula Ammuri, Saif Al-Kuwari, Mazen Hasna, Khalid Qaraqe
Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) over free-space optical links is a promising approach for secure communication, but its performance is limited by turbulence, pointing errors, and angular leakage that can be exploited by an eavesdropper. To mitigate this, we consider an angular rejection filter that defines a safe-zone at the receiver and blocks signals from outside the desired cone. A system and channel model is developed including turbulence, misalignment, and safe-zone effects, and information theoretic metrics are derived to evaluate security. Simulation results show that the safe zone significantly reduces information leakage and that careful tuning of beam waist, angular threshold, and aperture size is essential for maximizing the secret key rate. Larger apertures improve performance but increase receiver size, while longer links require sub 100 urad alignment accuracy. These results highlight safe-zone enforcement and parameter optimization as effective strategies for practical and secure CV-QKD.

Title: A Games-in-Games Paradigm for Strategic Hybrid Jump-Diffusions: Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs Hierarchy and Spectral Structure
Authors: Yunian Pan, Quanyan Zhu
Abstract: This paper develops a hierarchical games-in-games control architecture for hybrid stochastic systems governed by regime-switching jump-diffusions. We model the interplay between continuous state dynamics and discrete mode transitions as a bilevel differential game: an inner layer solves a robust stochastic control problem within each regime, while a strategic outer layer modulates the transition intensities of the underlying Markov chain. A Dynkin-based analysis yields a system of coupled Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equations. We prove that for the class of Linear-Quadratic games and Exponential-Affine games, this hierarchy admits tractable semi-closed form solutions via coupled matrix differential equations. We prove that for the class of Linear-Quadratic games and Exponential-Affine games, this hierarchy admits tractable semi-closed form solutions via coupled matrix differential equations. The framework is demonstrated through a case study on adversarial market microstructure, showing how the outer layer's strategic switching pre-emptively adjusts inventory spreads against latent regime risks, which leads to a hyper-alert equilibrium.

Title: SAM Audio: Segment Anything in Audio
Authors: Bowen Shi, Andros Tjandra, John Hoffman, Helin Wang, Yi-Chiao Wu, Luya Gao, Julius Richter, Matt Le, Apoorv Vyas, Sanyuan Chen, Christoph Feichtenhofer, Piotr Dollár, Wei-Ning Hsu, Ann Lee
Abstract: General audio source separation is a key capability for multimodal AI systems that can perceive and reason about sound. Despite substantial progress in recent years, existing separation models are either domain-specific, designed for fixed categories such as speech or music, or limited in controllability, supporting only a single prompting modality such as text. In this work, we present SAM Audio, a foundation model for general audio separation that unifies text, visual, and temporal span prompting within a single framework. Built on a diffusion transformer architecture, SAM Audio is trained with flow matching on large-scale audio data spanning speech, music, and general sounds, and can flexibly separate target sources described by language, visual masks, or temporal spans. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of benchmarks, including general sound, speech, music, and musical instrument separation in both in-the-wild and professionally produced audios, substantially outperforming prior general-purpose and specialized systems. Furthermore, we introduce a new real-world separation benchmark with human-labeled multimodal prompts and a reference-free evaluation model that correlates strongly with human judgment.

Title: Timing-Aware Two-Player Stochastic Games with Self-Triggered Control
Authors: Yunian Pan, Quanyan Zhu
Abstract: We study self-triggered two-player stochastic games on Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes (PDMPs) where each agent decides when to observe and which open-loop action to hold. Augmenting the state with clocks and committed controls yields flow regions (both hold) and trigger surfaces (at least one updates). The framework covers both blind simultaneous (Nash) timing and observable sequential (Stackelberg) commitments; the former leads to coupled, intractable QVIs, while the latter admits a nested Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman quasi-variational inequality and a tractable dynamic-programming decomposition. We outline a computational scheme based on implicit differentiation of the follower's fixed point. A pursuit-evasion example illustrates the strategic timing interaction.

Title: Bayesian Holonic Systems: Equilibrium, Uniqueness, and Computation
Authors: Yunian Pan, Quanyan Zhu
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of modeling and control in hierarchical, multi-agent systems, known as holonic systems, where local agent decisions are coupled with global systemic outcomes. We introduce the Bayesian Holonic Equilibrium (BHE), a concept that ensures consistency between agent-level rationality and system-wide emergent behavior. We establish the theoretical soundness of the BHE by showing its existence and, under stronger regularity conditions, its uniqueness. We propose a two-time scale learning algorithm to compute such an equilibrium. This algorithm mirrors the system's structure, with a fast timescale for intra-holon strategy coordination and a slow timescale for inter-holon belief adaptation about external risks. The convergence of the algorithm to the theoretical equilibrium is validated through a numerical experiment on a continuous public good game. This work provides a complete theoretical and algorithmic framework for the principled design and analysis of strategic risk in complex, coupled control systems.

Title: SLIM: Semantic-based Low-bitrate Image compression for Machines by leveraging diffusion
Authors: Hyeonjin Lee, Jun-Hyuk Kim, Jong-Seok Lee
Abstract: In recent years, the demand of image compression models for machine vision has increased dramatically. However, the training frameworks of image compression still focus on the vision of human, maintaining the excessive perceptual details, thus have limitations in optimally reducing the bits per pixel in the case of performing machine vision tasks. In this paper, we propose Semantic-based Low-bitrate Image compression for Machines by leveraging diffusion, termed SLIM. This is a new effective training framework of image compression for machine vision, using a pretrained latent diffusion this http URL compressor model of our method focuses only on the Region-of-Interest (RoI) areas for machine vision in the image latent, to compress it compactly. Then the pretrained Unet model enhances the decompressed latent, utilizing a RoI-focused text caption which containing semantic information of the image. Therefore, SLIM is able to focus on RoI areas of the image without any guide mask at the inference stage, achieving low bitrate when compressing. And SLIM is also able to enhance a decompressed latent by denoising steps, so the final reconstructed image from the enhanced latent can be optimized for the machine vision task while still containing perceptual details for human vision. Experimental results show that SLIM achieves a higher classification accuracy in the same bits per pixel condition, compared to conventional image compression models for this http URL will be released upon acceptance.

Title: Regularized Distributed MPC for UAV Networks: Stabilizing Coupled Motion and Hybrid Beam Alignment
Authors: Evangelos Vlachos
Abstract: This letter investigates the coupled control problem in UAV networks utilizing high-frequency hybrid beamsteering. While phased arrays enable rapid electronic scanning, their finite Field of View (FoV) imposes a fundamental constraint that necessitates active mechanical steering of the airframe to maintain connectivity. We propose a decentralized Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework that jointly optimizes trajectory and heading to maximize network sum-capacity subject to safety constraints. Addressing the numerical instability caused by fast-fading channel nulls, we introduce a regularized surrogate cost function based on discrete spatial smoothing. We analytically prove that this approximation bounds the cost curvature, restoring the Lipschitz continuity of the gradient. Crucially, we derive a sufficient condition linking this Lipschitz constant to the controller gain, guaranteeing the contraction and linear convergence of the distributed best-response dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively navigates the trade-off between electronic beam tracking and kinematic safety, significantly systematically outperforming velocity-aligned baselines.

Title: TICL+: A Case Study On Speech In-Context Learning for Children's Speech Recognition
Authors: Haolong Zheng, Yekaterina Yegorova, Mark Hasegawa-Johnson
Abstract: Children's speech recognition remains challenging due to substantial acoustic and linguistic variability, limited labeled data, and significant differences from adult speech. Speech foundation models can address these challenges through Speech In-Context Learning (SICL), allowing adaptation to new domains without fine-tuning. However, the effectiveness of SICL depends on how in-context examples are selected. We extend an existing retrieval-based method, Text-Embedding KNN for SICL (TICL), introducing an acoustic reranking step to create TICL+. This extension prioritizes examples that are both semantically and acoustically aligned with the test input. Experiments on four children's speech corpora show that TICL+ achieves up to a 53.3% relative word error rate reduction over zero-shot performance and 37.6% over baseline TICL, highlighting the value of combining semantic and acoustic information for robust, scalable ASR in children's speech.

Title: What Does the Speaker Embedding Encode?
Authors: Shuai Wang, Yanmin Qian, Kai Yu
Abstract: Developing a good speaker embedding has received tremendous interest in the speech community, with representations such as i-vector and d-vector demonstrating remarkable performance across various tasks. Despite their widespread adoption, a fundamental question remains largely unexplored: what properties are actually encoded in these embeddings? To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of three prominent speaker embedding methods: i-vector, d-vector, and RNN/LSTM-based sequence-vector (s-vector). Through carefully designed classification tasks, we systematically investigate their encoding capabilities across multiple dimensions, including speaker identity, gender, speaking rate, text content, word order, and channel information. Our analysis reveals distinct strengths and limitations of each embedding type: i-vector excels at speaker discrimination but encodes limited sequential information; s-vector captures text content and word order effectively but struggles with speaker identity; d-vector shows balanced performance but loses sequential information through averaging. Based on these insights, we propose a novel multi-task learning framework that integrates i-vector and s-vector, resulting in a new speaker embedding (i-s-vector) that combines their complementary advantages. Experimental results on RSR2015 demonstrate that the proposed i-s-vector achieves more than 50% EER reduction compared to the i-vector baseline on content mismatch trials, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Title: Power Converter DC Link Ripple and Network Unbalance as Active Constraints in Distribution System Optimal Power Flow
Authors: Matthew Deakin, Rahmat Heidari, Xu Deng
Abstract: The mitigation of unbalanced grid voltages or currents by voltage source converters results in power ripple on the dc link, and is a key converter design parameter due to hardware or stability considerations. Despite the importance of this issue for system design and operation, the use of Optimal Power Flow (OPF)-based methods capturing the interaction between dc link ripple and converter unbalanced operation has been largely unexplored. In this work, the magnitude of the power ripple is derived for generic multi-terminal converters, then introduced as a bilinear OPF constraint for two-level converter topologies. OPF case studies demonstrate the necessity to model both neutral current and dc link ripple, with tradeoffs between capacitor sizing and leg sizing highlighted for phase current unbalance mitigation applications. Time domain simulations of a grid-connected four-wire voltage source converter verify the accuracy and validity of the algebraic formulation. It is concluded that awareness of dc link ripple impacts and constraints will be of growing importance for distribution system operators.

Title: Two-Stage Signal Reconstruction for Amplitude-Phase-Time Block Modulation-based Communications
Authors: Meidong Xia, Min Fan, Wei Xu, Haiming Wang, Xiaohu You
Abstract: Operating power amplifiers (PAs) at lower input back-off (IBO) levels is an effective way to improve PA efficiency, but often introduces severe nonlinear distortion that degrades transmission performance. Amplitude-phase-time block modulation (APTBM) has recently emerged as an effective solution to this problem. By leveraging the intrinsic amplitude and phase constraints of each APTBM block, PA-induced nonlinear distortion can be mitigated through constraint-guided signal reconstruction. However, existing reconstruction methods apply these constraints only heuristically and statistically, limiting the achievable IBO reduction and PA efficiency improvement. This paper addresses this limitation by decomposing the nonlinear distortion into dominant and residual components, and accordingly develops a novel two-stage signal reconstruction algorithm consisting of coarse and fine reconstruction stages. The coarse reconstruction stage eliminates the dominant distortion by jointly exploiting the APTBM block structure and PA nonlinear characteristics. The fine reconstruction stage minimizes the residual distortion by formulating a nonconvex optimization problem that explicitly enforces the APTBM constraints. To handle this problem efficiently, a low-complexity iterative variable substitution method is introduced, which relaxes the problem into a sequence of trust-region subproblems, each solvable in closed form. The proposed algorithm is validated through comprehensive numerical simulations and testbed experiments. Results show that it achieves up to 4 dB IBO reduction in simulations and up to 2 dB IBO reduction in experiments while maintaining transmission performance, corresponding to PA efficiency improvements of 59.1\% and 33.9\%, respectively, over existing methods.

Title: State-Space Averaging Revisited via Reconstruction Operators
Authors: Yuxin Yang, Hang Zhou, Hourong Song, Branislav Hredzak
Abstract: This paper presents an operator-theoretic reconstruction of an equivalent continuous-time LTI model from an exact sampled-data (Poincaré-map) baseline of a piecewise-linear switching system. The rebuilding is explicitly expressed via matrix logarithms. By expanding the logarithm of a product of matrix exponentials using the Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff (BCH) formula, we show that the classical state-space averaging (SSA) model can be interpreted as the leading-order truncation of this exact reconstruction when the switching period is small and the ripple is small. The same view explains why SSA critically relies on low-frequency and small-ripple assumptions, and why the method becomes fragile for converters with more than two subintervals per cycle. Finally, we provide a complexity-reduced, SSA-flavoured implementation strategy for obtaining the required spectral quantities and a real-valued logarithm without explicitly calling eigen-decomposition or complex matrix logarithms, by exploiting $2\times 2$ invariants and a minimal real-lift construction.

Title: Cognitive Inference based Feature Pyramid Network for Sentimental Analysis using EEG Signals
Authors: Vishesh Bhardwaj, Aman Yadav, Srikireddy Dhanunjay Reddy, Tharun Kumar Reddy Bollu
Abstract: Sentiment analysis using Electroencephalography (EEG) sensor signals provides a deeper behavioral understanding of a person's emotional state, offering insights into real-time mood fluctuations. This approach takes advantage of brain electrical activity, making it a promising tool for various applications, including mental health monitoring, affective computing, and personalised user experiences. An encoder-based model for EEG-to-sentiment analysis, utilizing the ZUCO 2.0 dataset and incorporating a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), is proposed to enhance this process. FPNs are adapted here for EEG sensor data, enabling multiscale feature extraction to capture local and global sentiment-related patterns. The raw EEG sensor data from the ZUCO 2.0 dataset is pre-processed and passed through the FPN, which extracts hierarchical features. In addition, extracted features are passed to a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model temporal dependencies, thereby enhancing the accuracy of sentiment classification. The ZUCO 2.0 dataset is utilized for its clear and detailed representation in 128 channels, offering rich spatial and temporal resolution. The experimental metric results show that the proposed architecture achieves a 6.88\% performance gain compared to the existing methods. Furthermore, the proposed framework demonstrated its efficacy on the validation datasets DEAP and SEED.

Title: Robust H-infinity control under stochastic requirements: minimizing conditional value-at-risk instead of worst-case performance
Authors: Ervan Kassarian, Francesco Sanfedino, Daniel Alazard, Andrea Marrazza
Abstract: Conventional robust $\mathcal H_2/\mathcal H_\infty$ control minimizes the worst-case performance, often leading to a conservative design driven by very rare and somewhat arbitrary parametric configurations. To reduce this conservatism while taking advantage of the stochastic properties of Monte-Carlo sampling and its compatibility with parallel computing, we introduce an alternative paradigm that optimizes the controller with respect to a stochastic criterion, namely the conditional value at risk. We illustrate the potential of this approach on a realistic satellite benchmark, showing that it can significantly improve overall performance by tolerating some degradation in very rare worst-case scenarios.

Title: PSI3D: Plug-and-Play 3D Stochastic Inference with Slice-wise Latent Diffusion Prior
Authors: Wenhan Guo, Jinglun Yu, Yaning Wang, Jin U. Kang, Yu Sun
Abstract: Diffusion models are highly expressive image priors for Bayesian inverse problems. However, most diffusion models cannot operate on large-scale, high-dimensional data due to high training and inference costs. In this work, we introduce a Plug-and-play algorithm for 3D stochastic inference with latent diffusion prior (PSI3D) to address massive ($1024\times 1024\times 128$) volumes. Specifically, we formulate a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach to reconstruct each two-dimensional (2D) slice by sampling from a 2D latent diffusion model. To enhance inter-slice consistency, we also incorporate total variation (TV) regularization stochastically along the concatenation axis. We evaluate our performance on optical coherence tomography (OCT) super-resolution. Our method significantly improves reconstruction quality for large-scale scientific imaging compared to traditional and learning-based baselines, while providing robust and credible reconstructions.

Title: Phoneme-based speech recognition driven by large language models and sampling marginalization
Authors: Te Ma, Nanjie Li, Hao Huang, Zhijian Ou
Abstract: Recently, the Large Language Model-based Phoneme-to-Grapheme (LLM-P2G) method has shown excellent performance in speech recognition tasks and has become a feasible direction to replace the traditional WFST decoding method. This framework takes into account both recognition accuracy and system scalability through two-stage modeling of phoneme prediction and text generation. However, the existing LLM-P2G adopts the Top-K Marginalized (TKM) training strategy, and its candidate phoneme sequences rely on beam search generation, which has problems such as insufficient path diversity, low training efficiency, and high resource overhead. To this end, this paper proposes a sampling marginalized training strategy (Sampling-K Marginalized, SKM), which replaces beam search with random sampling to generate candidate paths, improving marginalized modeling and training efficiency. Experiments were conducted on Polish and German datasets, and the results showed that SKM further improved the model learning convergence speed and recognition performance while maintaining the complexity of the model. Comparative experiments with a speech recognition method that uses a projector combined with a large language model (SpeechLLM) also show that the SKM-driven LLM-P2G has more advantages in recognition accuracy and structural simplicity. The study verified the practical value and application potential of this method in cross-language speech recognition systems.

Title: Neural Proofs for Sound Verification and Control of Complex Systems
Authors: Alessandro Abate
Abstract: This informal contribution presents an ongoing line of research that is pursuing a new approach to the construction of sound proofs for the formal verification and control of complex stochastic models of dynamical systems, of reactive programs and, more generally, of models of Cyber-Physical Systems. Neural proofs are made up of two key components: 1) proof rules encode requirements entailing the verification of general temporal specifications over the models of interest; and 2) certificates that discharge such rules, namely they are constructed from said proof rules with an inductive (that is, cyclic, repetitive) approach; this inductive approach involves: 2a) accessing samples from the model's dynamics and accordingly training neural networks, whilst 2b) generalising such networks via SAT-modulo-theory (SMT) queries that leverage the full knowledge of the models. In the context of sequential decision making problems over complex stochastic models, it is possible to additionally generate provably-correct policies/strategies/controllers, namely state-feedback functions that, in conjunction with neural certificates, formally attain the given specifications for the models of interest.

Title: RIS-Aided Spatial Nulling: Algorithms, Analysis, and Nulling Limits
Authors: Xinrui Li, R. Michael Buehrer, Steven W. Ellingson
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) have recently gained attention as a means to dynamically shape the wireless propagation environment through programmable reflection control. Among the numerous applications, an important emerging use case is employing RIS as an auxiliary mechanism for spatial interference nulling, particularly in large ground-based reflector antennas where sidelobe interference can significantly degrade the system performance. With the growing density of satellites and terrestrial emitters, algorithms with faster convergence speed and better performance are needed. This work investigates RIS-equipped reflector antennas as a representative example of RIS-assisted spatial nulling and develop algorithms for sidelobe cancellation at specific directions and frequencies under various constraints. For the continuous-phase case, we adapt the gradient projection (GP) and alternating projection (AP) algorithms for scalability and propose a closed-form near-optimal solution that achieves satisfactory nulling performance with significantly reduced complexity. For the discrete-phase case, we reformulate the problem using a penalty method and solve it via majorization-minimization, outperforming the heuristic methods from our earlier work. Further, we analyze the electric field characteristics across multiple interference directions and frequencies to quantify the nulling capability of the RIS-aided reflectors, and identify a simple criterion for the existence of unimodular weights enabling perfect nulls. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and confirm the theoretical nulling limits.

Title: On the Limits of Coherent Time-Domain Cancellation of Radio Frequency Interference
Authors: Xinrui Li, R. Michael Buehrer
Abstract: In many sensing (viz., radio astronomy) and radar applications, the received signal of interest (SOI) exhibits a significantly wider bandwidth or weaker power than the interference signal, rendering it indistinguishable from the background noise. Such scenarios arise frequently in applications such as passive radar, cognitive radio, low-probability-of-intercept (LPI) radar, and planetary radar for radio astronomy, where canceling the radio frequency interference (RFI) is critical for uncovering the SOI. In this work, we examine the Demodulation-Remodulation (Demod-Remod) based interference cancellation framework for the RFI. This approach demodulates the unknown interference, creates a noise-free interference replica, and coherently subtracts it from the received signal. To evaluate the performance limits, we employ the performance metric termed \textit{interference rejection ratio} (IRR), which quantifies the interference canceled. We derive the analytical expressions of IRR as a function of the optimal estimation variances of the signal parameters. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the analytical expression for both single-carrier and multi-carrier interference signals and demonstrate that the method can substantially suppress the interference at a sufficient interference-to-noise ratio (INR), enabling enhanced detection and extraction of the SOI. We further extend the analysis to the scenario where the SOI is above the noise floor, and confirm the validity of the theoretical IRR expression in this scenario. Lastly, we compare the Demod-Remod technique to other time-domain cancellation methods. The result of the comparison identifies the conditions under which each method is preferred, offering practical guidelines for interference mitigation under different scenarios.

Title: Virtual Resistance-Based Control for Grid-Connected Inverters using Persidskii Systems Approach
Authors: Chakib Chatri, Ajul Dinesh, Moussa Labbadi
Abstract: This work addresses virtual resistance (VR)based control for grid-connected inverters, which enhances transient damping, reduces steady-state errors, and improves robustness to grid disturbances without requiring additional voltage sensors. Classical passivity-based VR control is robust, but limited by restrictive sector bounds on nonlinearities. We extend these bounds and model the closed-loop system as a generalized Persidskii-type nonlinear system. Using this framework, we derive input-to-state stability (ISS) conditions that account for the extended nonlinearities and external disturbances, providing a systematic and less conservative approach to VR control design under practical operating conditions, which is validated through extensive simulations.

Title: A Distributed Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Edge-Enhanced Graph Neural Network for City-Scale Dynamic Logistics Routing
Authors: Zihan Han, Lingran Meng, Jingwei Zhang
Abstract: City-scale logistics routing has become increasingly challenging as metropolitan road networks grow to tens of millions of edges and traffic conditions evolve rapidly under high-volume mobility demands. Conventional centralized routing algorithms and monolithic graph neural network (GNN) models suffer from limited scalability, high latency, and poor real-time adaptability, which restricts their effectiveness in large urban logistics systems. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Distributed Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Edge-Enhanced Graph Neural Network (HSTE-GNN) for dynamic routing over ultra-large road networks. The framework partitions the city-scale graph into regional subgraphs processed in parallel across distributed computing nodes, enabling efficient learning of localized traffic dynamics. Within each region, an edge-enhanced spatio-temporal module jointly models node states, dynamic edge attributes, and short-term temporal dependencies. A hierarchical coordination layer further aggregates cross-region representations through an asynchronous parameter-server mechanism, ensuring global routing coherence under high-frequency traffic updates. This distributed hierarchical design balances local responsiveness with global consistency, significantly improving scalability and inference efficiency. Experiments on real-world large-scale traffic datasets from Beijing and New York demonstrate that HSTE-GNN outperforms strong spatio-temporal baselines such as ST-GRAPH, achieving 34.9% lower routing delay, 14.7% lower MAPE, and 11.8% lower RMSE, while improving global route consistency by 7.3%. These results confirm that the proposed framework provides a scalable, adaptive, and efficient solution for next-generation intelligent transportation systems and large-scale logistics platforms.

Title: Sink Proximity: A Novel Approach for Online Vehicle Dispatch in Ride-hailing
Authors: Ruiting Wang, Jiaman Wu, Fabio Paparella, Scott J. Moura, Marta C. Gonzalez
Abstract: Ride-hailing platforms have a profound impact on urban transportation systems, and their performance largely depends on how intelligently they dispatch vehicles in real time. In this work, we develop a new approach to online vehicle dispatch that strengthens a platform's ability to serve more requests under demand uncertainty. We introduce a novel measure called sink proximity, a network-science-inspired measure that captures how demand and vehicle flows are likely to evolve across the city. By integrating this measure into a shareability-network framework, we design an online dispatch algorithm that naturally considers future network states, without depending on fragile spatiotemporal forecasts. Numerical studies demonstrate that our proposed solution significantly improves the request service rate under peak hours within a receding horizon framework with limited future information available.

Title: Scaling up Stability: Reinforcement Learning for Distributed Control of Networked Systems in the Space of Stabilizing Policies
Authors: John Cao, Luca Furieri
Abstract: We study distributed control of networked systems through reinforcement learning, where neural policies must be simultaneously scalable, expressive and stabilizing. We introduce a policy parameterization that embeds Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into a Youla-like magnitude-direction parameterization, yielding distributed stochastic controllers that guarantee network-level closed-loop stability by design. The magnitude is implemented as a stable operator consisting of a GNN acting on disturbance feedback, while the direction is a GNN acting on local observations. We prove robustness of the closed loop to perturbations in both the graph topology and model parameters, and show how to integrate our parameterization with Proximal Policy Optimization. Experiments on a multi-agent navigation task show that policies trained on small networks transfer directly to larger ones and unseen network topologies, achieve higher returns and lower variance than a state-of-the-art MARL baseline while preserving stability.

Title: Image-to-Image Translation with Generative Adversarial Network for Electrical Resistance Tomography Reconstruction
Authors: Wejian Yan
Abstract: Electrical tomography techniques have been widely employed for multiphase-flow monitoring owing to their non invasive nature, intrinsic safety, and low cost. Nevertheless, conventional reconstructions struggle to capture fine details, which hampers broader adoption. Motivated by recent advances in deep learning, this study introduces a Pix2Pix generative adversarial network (GAN) to enhance image reconstruction in electrical capacitance tomography (ECT). Comprehensive simulated and experimental databases were established and multiple baseline reconstruction algorithms were implemented. The proposed GAN demonstrably improves quantitative metrics such as SSIM, PSNR, and PMSE, while qualitatively producing high resolution images with sharp boundaries that are no longer constrained by mesh discretization.

Title: Distributionally Robust Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Intelligent Traffic Control
Authors: Shuwei Pei, Joran Borger, Arda Kosay, Muhammed O. Sayin, Saeed Ahmed
Abstract: Learning-based traffic signal control is typically optimized for average performance under a few nominal demand patterns, which can result in poor behavior under atypical traffic conditions. To address this, we develop a distributionally robust multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for signal control on a 3x3 urban grid calibrated from a contiguous 3x3 subarea of central Athens covered by the pNEUMA trajectory dataset (Barmpounakis and Geroliminis, 2020). Our approach proceeds in three stages. First, we train a baseline multi-agent RL controller in which each intersection is governed by a proximal policy optimization agent with discrete signal phases, using a centralized training, decentralized execution paradigm. Second, to capture demand uncertainty, we construct eight heterogeneous origin-destination-based traffic scenarios-one directly derived from pNEUMA and seven synthetically generated-to span a wide range of spatial and temporal demand patterns. Over this scenario set, we train a contextual-bandit worst-case estimator that assigns mixture weights to estimate adversarial demand distributions conditioned on context. Finally, without modifying the controller architecture, we fine-tune the baseline multi-agent reinforcement learning agents under these estimated worst-case mixtures to obtain a distributionally robust multi-agent reinforcement learning controller. Across all eight scenarios, as well as on an unseen validation network based on the Sioux Falls configuration, the distributionally robust multi-agent reinforcement learning controller consistently reduces horizon-averaged queues and increases average speeds relative to the baseline, achieving up to 51% shorter queues and 38% higher speeds on the worst-performing scenarios.

Title: MeanFlow-TSE: One-Step Generative Target Speaker Extraction with Mean Flow
Authors: Riki Shimizu, Xilin Jiang, Nima Mesgarani
Abstract: Target speaker extraction (TSE) aims to isolate a desired speaker's voice from a multi-speaker mixture using auxiliary information such as a reference utterance. Although recent advances in diffusion and flow-matching models have improved TSE performance, these methods typically require multi-step sampling, which limits their practicality in low-latency settings. In this work, we propose MeanFlow-TSE, a one-step generative TSE framework trained with mean-flow objectives, enabling fast and high-quality generation without iterative refinement. Building on the AD-FlowTSE paradigm, our method defines a flow between the background and target source that is governed by the mixing ratio (MR). Experiments on the Libri2Mix corpus show that our approach outperforms existing diffusion- and flow-matching-based TSE models in separation quality and perceptual metrics while requiring only a single inference step. These results demonstrate that mean-flow-guided one-step generation offers an effective and efficient alternative for real-time target speaker extraction. Code is available at this https URL.

Title: Smart nudging for efficient routing through networks
Authors: Pouria M. Oqaz, Emanuele Crisostomi, Elena Dieckmann, Robert Shorten
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate the design of efficient digitalised deposit return schemes as a control problem. We focus on the recycling of paper cups, though the proposed methodology applies more broadly to reverse logistics systems arising in circular economy R-strategies. Each item is assumed to carry a digital wallet through which monetary rewards are allocated to actors transferring the item across successive stages, incentivising completion of the recycling process. System efficiency is ensured by: (i) decentralised algorithms that avoid congestion at individual nodes; (ii) a decentralised AIMD-based algorithm that optimally splits the deposit across layers; and (iii) a feedback control loop that dynamically adjusts the deposit to achieve a desired throughput. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through extensive simulations using realistic paper cup recycling data.

Title: The Choice of Line Lengths in Multiline Thru-Reflect-Line Calibration
Authors: Ziad Hatab, Michael Gadringer, Wolfgang Bösch
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis and rigorous procedure for determining the optimal lengths of line standards in multiline thru-reflect-line (TRL) calibration of vector network analyzers (VNAs). The solution is obtained through nonlinear constrained optimization of the eigenvalue problem in multiline TRL calibration. Additionally, we propose a simplified approach for near-optimal length selection based on predefined sparse rulers. Alongside the length calculation, we discuss the required number of lines to meet bandwidth requirements. The sensitivity of the proposed procedure is evaluated numerically via Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating that the derived lengths have lower uncertainty than those from existing industry standards. Practical examples are provided for various applications, including lossy and dispersive lines, as well as banded solutions for waveguides.

Title: Multi-Waveguide Pinching Antenna Placement Optimization for Rate Maximization
Authors: Yue Zhang, Yaru Fu, Pei Liu, Yalin Liu, Kevin Hung
Abstract: Pinching antenna systems (PASS) have emerged as a technology that enables the large-scale movement of antenna elements, offering significant potential for performance gains in next-generation wireless networks. This paper investigates the problem of maximizing the average per-user data rate by optimizing the antenna placement of a multi-waveguide PASS, subject to a stringent physical minimum spacing constraint. To address this complex challenge, which involves a coupled fractional objective and a non-convex constraint, we employ the fractional programming (FP) framework to transform the non-convex rate maximization problem into a more tractable one, and devise a projected gradient ascent (PGA)-based algorithm to iteratively solve the transformed problem. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme significantly outperforms various geometric placement baselines, achieving superior per-user data rates by actively mitigating multi-user interference.

Title: DeepGuard: Defending Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding Against Eavesdropping at Physical-Layer
Authors: Kaiyi Chi, Yinghui He, Qianqian Yang, Yuanchao Shu, Zhiqin Wang, Jun Luo, Jiming Chen
Abstract: Deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for efficient and robust information transmission. However, its intrinsic characteristics also pose new security challenges, notably an increased vulnerability to eavesdropping attacks. Existing studies on defending against eavesdropping attacks in DeepJSCC, while demonstrating certain effectiveness, often incur considerable computational overhead or introduce performance trade-offs that may adversely affect legitimate users. In this paper, we present DeepGuard, to the best of our knowledge, the first physical-layer defense framework for DeepJSCC against eavesdropping attacks, validated through over-the-air experiments using software-defined radios (SDRs). Considering that existing eavesdropping attacks against DeepJSCC are limited to simulation under ideal channels, we take a step further by identifying and implementing four representative types of attacks under various configurations in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems. These attacks are evaluated over-the-air under diverse scenarios, allowing us to comprehensively characterize the real-world threat landscape. To mitigate these threats, DeepGuard introduces a novel preamble perturbation mechanism that modifies the preamble shared only between legitimate transceivers. To realize it, we first conduct a theoretical analysis of the perturbation's impact on the signals intercepted by the eavesdropper. Building upon this, we develop an end-to-end perturbation optimization algorithm that significantly degrades eavesdropping performance while preserving reliable communication for legitimate users. We prototype DeepGuard using SDRs and conduct extensive over-the-air experiments in practical scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeepGuard effectively mitigates eavesdropping threats.

Title: Decentralized GNSS at Global Scale via Graph-Aware Diffusion Adaptation
Authors: Xue Xian Zheng, Xing Liu, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri
Abstract: Network-based Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) underpin critical infrastructure and autonomous systems, yet typically rely on centralized processing hubs that limit scalability, resilience, and latency. Here we report a global-scale, decentralized GNSS architecture spanning hundreds of ground stations. By modeling the receiver network as a time-varying graph, we employ a deep linear neural network approach to learn topology-aware mixing schedules that optimize information exchange. This enables a gradient tracking diffusion strategy wherein stations execute local inference and exchange succinct messages to achieve two concurrent objectives: centimeter-level self-localization and network-wide consensus on satellite correction products. The consensus products are broadcast to user receivers as corrections, supporting precise point positioning (PPP) and precise point positioning-real-time kinematic (PPP-RTK). Numerical results demonstrate that our method matches the accuracy of centralized baselines while significantly outperforming existing decentralized methods in convergence speed and communication overhead. By reframing decentralized GNSS as a networked signal processing problem, our results pave the way for integrating decentralized optimization, consensus-based inference, and graph-aware learning as effective tools in operational satellite navigation.

Title: Domain Adaptation in Structural Health Monitoring of Civil Infrastructure: A Systematic Review
Authors: Yifeng Zhang, Xiao Liang
Abstract: This study provides a comprehensive review of domain adaptation (DA) techniques in vibration-based structural health monitoring (SHM). As data-driven models increasingly support the assessment of civil structures, the persistent challenge of transferring knowledge across varying geometries, materials, and environmental conditions remains a major obstacle. DA offers a systematic approach to mitigate these discrepancies by aligning feature distributions between simulated, laboratory, and field domains while preserving the sensitivity of damage-related information. Drawing on more than sixty representative studies, this paper analyzes the evolution of DA methods for SHM, including statistical alignment, adversarial and subdomain learning, physics-informed adaptation, and generative modeling for simulation-to-real transfer. The review summarizes their contributions and limitations across bridge and building applications, revealing that while DA has improved generalization significantly, key challenges persist: managing domain discrepancy, addressing data scarcity, enhancing model interpretability, and enabling adaptability to multiple sources and time-varying conditions. Future research directions emphasize integrating physical constraints into learning objectives, developing physics-consistent generative frameworks to enhance data realism, establishing interpretable and certifiable DA systems for engineering practice, and advancing multi-source and lifelong adaptation for scalable monitoring. Overall, this review consolidates the methodological foundation of DA for SHM, identifies existing barriers to generalization and trust, and outlines the technological trajectory toward transparent, physics-aware, and adaptive monitoring systems that support the long-term resilience of civil infrastructure.

Title: RIS-Enabled Smart Wireless Environments: Fundamentals and Distributed Optimization
Authors: George C. Alexandropoulos, Kostantinos D. Katsanos, George Stamatelis, Ioannis Gavras
Abstract: This chapter overviews the concept of Smart Wireless Environments (SWEs) motivated by the emerging technology of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs). The operating principles and state-of-the-art hardware architectures of programmable metasurfaces are first introduced. Subsequently, key performance objectives and use cases of RIS-enabled SWEs, including spectral and energy efficiency, physical-layer security, integrated sensing and communications, as well as the emerging paradigm of over-the-air computing, are discussed. Focusing on the recent trend of Beyond-Diagonal (BD) RISs, two distributed designs of respective SWEs are presented. The first deals with a multi-user Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) system operating within the area of influence of a SWE comprising multiple BD-RISs. A hybrid distributed and fusion machine learning framework based on multi-branch attention-based convolutional Neural Networks (NNs), NN parameter sharing, and neuroevolutionary training is presented, which enables online mapping of channel realizations to the BD-RIS configurations as well as the multi-user transmit precoder. Performance evaluation results showcase that the distributedly optimized RIS-enabled SWE achieves near-optimal sum-rate performance with low online computational complexity. The second design focuses on the wideband interference MISO broadcast channel, where each base station exclusively controls one BD-RIS to serve its assigned group of users. A cooperative optimization framework that jointly designs the base station transmit precoders as well as the tunable capacitances and switch matrices of all metasurfaces is presented. Numerical results demonstrating the superior sum-rate performance of the designed RIS-enabled SWE for multi-cell MISO networks over benchmark schemes, considering non-cooperative configuration and conventional diagonal metasurfaces, are presented.

Title: A 100-GHz CMOS-Compatible RIS-on-Chip Based on Phase-Delay Lines for 6G Applications
Authors: Xiarui Su, Xihui Teng, Yiyang Yu, Yiming Yang, Atif Shamim
Abstract: On-chip reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) are expected to play a vital role in future 6G communication systems. This work proposed a CMOS-compatible on-chip RIS capable of achieving beam steering for the first time. The proposed unit cell design is a combination of a slot, a phase-delay line with VO2, and a ground. Under the two states of the VO2, the unit cell has a 180 deg phase difference at the center frequency, while maintaining reflection magnitudes better than -1.2 dB. Moreover, a 60by60 RIS array based on the present novel unit is designed, demonstrating the beam-steering capability. Finally, to validate the design concept, a prototype is fabricated, and the detailed fabrication process is presented. The measurement result demonstrates a 27.1 dB enhancement between ON and OFF states. The proposed RIS has the advantages of low loss, CMOS-compatibility, providing a foundation for future 6G applications.

Title: Distribution Network Restoration with Mobile Resources Dispatch: A Simulation-Based Online Dynamic Programming Approach
Authors: Mingxuan Li, Wei Wei, Yin Xu, Ying Wang, Shanshan Shi
Abstract: Dispatching mobile resources such as repair crews and mobile emergency generators is essential for the rapid restoration of distribution systems after extreme events. However, the restoration process is affected by various uncertain factors including repair time, road condition, and newly observed failures, necessitating online decision-making in response to real-time information. This paper proposes a simulation-based online dynamic programming approach to provide real-time restoration actions considering the dispatch of mobile resources. Using an index-based priority rule as the base policy, the remaining cumulative loss at the current state and a given action is evaluated from online simulation. As the base policy is explicit, the simulation is efficient. Then, the action leading to the minimum cumulative loss is chosen. It is proven that such a strategy improves the performance of base policy. The proposed policy adapts to real-time information updates and does not rely on offline training, so incurs no data and convergence-related issues, which is important in restoration tasks where the historical data of extreme events is rare. The rolling optimization approach may not meet the requirement of online use, because routing mobile resources gives rise to large-scale discrete optimization problems. Case studies on 123-bus and 8500-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher efficiency and better performance compared with rolling horizon optimization.

Title: Decentralized Cooperative Beamforming for Networked LEO Satellites with Statistical CSI
Authors: Yuchen Zhang, Eva Lagunas, Xue Xian Zheng, Symeon Chatzinotas, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri
Abstract: Inter-satellite-link-enabled low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite constellations are evolving toward networked architectures that support constellation-level cooperation, enabling multiple satellites to jointly serve user terminals through cooperative beamforming. While such cooperation can substantially enhance link budgets and achievable rates, its practical realization is challenged by the scalability limitations of centralized beamforming designs and the stringent computational and signaling constraints of large LEO constellations. This paper develops a fully decentralized cooperative beamforming framework for networked LEO satellite downlinks. Using an ergodic-rate-based formulation, we first derive a centralized weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) solution as a performance benchmark. Building on this formulation, we propose a topology-agnostic decentralized beamforming algorithm by localizing the benchmark and exchanging a set of globally coupled variables whose dimensions are independent of the antenna number and enforcing consensus over arbitrary connected inter-satellite networks. The resulting algorithm admits fully parallel execution across satellites. To further enhance scalability, we eliminate the consensus-related auxiliary variables in closed form and derive a low-complexity per-satellite update rule that is optimal to local iteration and admits a quasi-closed-form solution via scalar line search. Simulation results show that the proposed decentralized schemes closely approach centralized performance under practical inter-satellite topologies, while significantly reducing computational complexity and signaling overhead, enabling scalable cooperative beamforming for large LEO constellations.

Title: Enhancing Fully Formatted End-to-End Speech Recognition with Knowledge Distillation via Multi-Codebook Vector Quantization
Authors: Jian You, Xiangfeng Li, Erwan Zerhouni
Abstract: Conventional automatic speech recognition (ASR) models typically produce outputs as normalized texts lacking punctuation and capitalization, necessitating post-processing models to enhance readability. This approach, however, introduces additional complexity and latency due to the cascaded system design. In response to this challenge, there is a growing trend to develop end-to-end (E2E) ASR models capable of directly predicting punctuation and capitalization, though this area remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose an enhanced fully formatted E2E ASR model that leverages knowledge distillation (KD) through multi-codebook vector quantization (MVQ). Experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms previous works in word error rate (WER) both with and without punctuation and capitalization, and in punctuation error rate (PER). Evaluations on the LibriSpeech-PC test-clean and test-other subsets show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results.

Title: FAS-RIS for V2X: Unlocking Realistic Performance Analysis with Finite Elements
Authors: Tuo Wu, Xiazhi Lai, Maged Elkashlan, Naofal Al-Dhahir, Matthew C. Valenti, Fumiyuki Adachi
Abstract: The synergy of fluid antenna systems (FAS) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) is poised to unlock robust Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications. However, a critical gap persists between theoretical predictions and real-world performance. Existing analyses predominantly rely on the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), an assumption valid only for a large number of RIS elements, which fails to represent practical, finite-sized deployments constrained by cost and urban infrastructure. This paper bridges this gap by presenting a novel framework that unlocks a realistic performance analysis for FAS-RIS systems with finite elements. Leveraging a Gamma distribution approximation, we derive a new, tractable closed-form expression for the outage probability. Numerical results validate our approach, demonstrating that it offers a significantly more accurate performance characterization than conventional CLT-based methods, particularly in the practical regime of small-scale RIS. This work provides a crucial foundation for the design and deployment of reliable FAS-RIS-aided vehicular networks.

Title: An Fluid Antenna Array-Enabled DOA Estimation Method: End-Fire Effect Suppression
Authors: Jiaji Ren, Ye Tian, Baiyang Liu, Tuo Wu, Wei Liu, Kai-Kit Wong, Kin-Fai Tong, Kwai-Man Luk
Abstract: Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation serves as a critical sensing technology poised to play a vital role in future intelligent and ubiquitous communication systems. Despite the development of numerous mature super-resolution algorithms, the inherent end-fire effect problem in fixed antenna arrays remains inadequately addressed. This work proposed a novel array architecture composed of fluid antennas. By exploiting the spatial reconfigurability of their positions to equivalently modulate the array steering vector and integrating it with the classical MUSIC algorithm, this approach achieved high-precision DOA estimation. Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed method delivers outstanding estimation performance even in highly challenging end-fire regions.

Title: Reimagining Wireless Connectivity: The FAS-RIS Synergy for 6G Smart Cities
Authors: Tuo Wu, Kai-Kit Wong, Jie Tang, Junteng Yao, Baiyang Liu, Kin-Fai Tong, Chan-Byoung Chae, Matthew C. Valenti, Kwai-Man Luk
Abstract: Fluid antenna system (FAS) represents the concept of treating antenna as a reconfigurable physical-layer resource to broaden system design and network optimization and inspire next-generation reconfigurable antennas. FAS can unleash new degree of freedom (DoF) via antenna reconfigurations for novel spatial diversity. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) on the other hand can reshape wireless propagation environments but often face limitations from double path-loss and minimal signal processing capability when operating independently. This article envisions a transformative FAS-RIS integrated architecture for future smart city networks, uniting the adaptability of FAS with the environmental control of RIS. The proposed framework has five key applications: FAS-enabled base stations (BSs) for large-scale beamforming, FAS-equipped user devices with finest spatial diversity, and three novel RIS paradigms -- fluid RIS (FRIS) with reconfigurable elements, FAS-embedded RIS as active relays, and enormous FAS (E-FAS) exploiting surface waves on facades to re-establish line-of-sight (LoS) communication. A two-timescale control mechanism coordinates network-level beamforming with rapid, device-level adaptation. Applications spanning from simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) to integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), with challenges in co-design, channel modeling, and optimization, are discussed. This article concludes with simulation results demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of the FAS-RIS system.

Title: PalpAid: Multimodal Pneumatic Tactile Sensor for Tissue Palpation
Authors: Devi Yuliarti, Ravi Prakash, Hiu Ching Cheung, Amy Strong, Patrick J. Codd, Shan Lin
Abstract: The tactile properties of tissue, such as elasticity and stiffness, often play an important role in surgical oncology when identifying tumors and pathological tissue boundaries. Though extremely valuable, robot-assisted surgery comes at the cost of reduced sensory information to the surgeon; typically, only vision is available. Sensors proposed to overcome this sensory desert are often bulky, complex, and incompatible with the surgical workflow. We present PalpAid, a multimodal pneumatic tactile sensor equipped with a microphone and pressure sensor, converting contact force into an internal pressure differential. The pressure sensor acts as an event detector, while the auditory signature captured by the microphone assists in tissue delineation. We show the design, fabrication, and assembly of sensory units with characterization tests to show robustness to use, inflation-deflation cycles, and integration with a robotic system. Finally, we show the sensor's ability to classify 3D-printed hard objects with varying infills and soft ex vivo tissues. Overall, PalpAid aims to fill the sensory gap intelligently and allow improved clinical decision-making.

Title: The MIMO-ME-MS Channel: Analysis and Algorithm for Secure MIMO Integrated Sensing and Communications
Authors: Seongkyu Jung, Namyoon Lee, Jeonghun Park
Abstract: This paper studies precoder design for secure MIMO integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) by introducing the MIMO-ME-MS channel, where a multi-antenna transmitter serves a legitimate multi-antenna receiver in the presence of a multi-antenna eavesdropper while simultaneously enabling sensing via a multi-antenna sensing receiver. Using sensing mutual information as the sensing metric, we formulate a nonconvex weighted objective that jointly captures secure communication (via secrecy rate) and sensing performance. A high-SNR analysis based on subspace decomposition characterizes the maximum achievable weighted degrees of freedom and reveals that a quasi-optimal precoder must span a "useful subspace," highlighting why straightforward extensions of classical wiretap/ISAC precoders can be suboptimal in this tripartite setting. Motivated by these insights, we develop a practical two-stage iterative algorithm that alternates between sequential basis construction and power allocation via a difference-of-convex program. Numerical results show that the proposed approach captures the desirable precoding structure predicted by the analysis and yields substantial gains in the MIMO-ME-MS channel.

Title: AI-Driven Subcarrier-Level CQI Feedback
Authors: Chengyong Jiang, Jiajia Guo, Yuqing Hua, Chao-Kai Wen, Shi Jin
Abstract: The Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) is a fundamental component of channel state information (CSI) that enables adaptive modulation and coding by selecting the optimal modulation and coding scheme to meet a target block error rate. While AI-enabled CSI feedback has achieved significant advances, especially in precoding matrix index feedback, AI-based CQI feedback remains underexplored. Conventional subband-based CQI approaches, due to coarse granularity, often fail to capture fine frequency-selective variations and thus lead to suboptimal resource allocation. In this paper, we propose an AI-driven subcarrier-level CQI feedback framework tailored for 6G and NextG systems. First, we introduce CQInet, an autoencoder-based scheme that compresses per-subcarrier CQI at the user equipment and reconstructs it at the base station, significantly reducing feedback overhead without compromising CQI accuracy. Simulation results show that CQInet increases the effective data rate by 7.6% relative to traditional subband CQI under equivalent feedback overhead. Building on this, we develop SR-CQInet, which leverages super-resolution to infer fine-grained subcarrier CQI from sparsely reported CSI reference signals (CSI-RS). SR-CQInet reduces CSI-RS overhead to 3.5% of CQInet's requirements while maintaining comparable throughput. These results demonstrate that AI-driven subcarrier-level CQI feedback can substantially enhance spectral efficiency and reliability in future wireless networks.

Title: Wireless sEMG-IMU Wearable for Real-Time Squat Kinematics and Muscle Activation
Authors: Marie Jose Perez Peralta, Daniela Flores Casillas, Benjamin Wilson, Cristian Aviles Medina, Yira Itzae Rendon Hernandez, Vladimir Orrante Bracho
Abstract: This work presents the design and implementation of a wireless, wearable system that combines surface electromyography (sEMG) and inertial measurement units (IMUs) to analyze a single lower-limb functional task: the free bodyweight squat in a healthy adult. The system records bipolar EMG from one agonist and one antagonist muscle of the dominant leg (vastus lateralis and semitendinosus) while simultaneously estimating knee joint angle, angular velocity, and angular acceleration using two MPU6050 IMUs. A custom dual-channel EMG front end with differential instrumentation preamplification, analog filtering (5-500 Hz band-pass and 60 Hz notch), high final gain, and rectified-integrated output was implemented on a compact 10 cm x 12 cm PCB. Data are digitized by an ESP32 microcontroller and transmitted wirelessly via ESP-NOW to a second ESP32 connected to a PC. A Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) displays EMG and kinematic signals in real time, manages subject metadata, and exports a summary of each session to Excel. The complete system is battery-powered to reduce electrical risk during human use. The resulting prototype demonstrates the feasibility of low-cost, portable EMG-IMU instrumentation for integrated analysis of muscle activation and squat kinematics and provides a platform for future biomechanical applications in sports performance and rehabilitation.

Title: Intelligent Sky Mirrors: SAC-Driven MF-RIS Optimization for Secure NOMA in Low-Altitude Economy
Authors: Sai Zhao, Fanjin Kong, Dong Tang, Tuo Wu, Shunxing Yang, Kai-Kit Wong, Kin-Fai Tong, Kwai-Man Luk
Abstract: Low-altitude economy (LAE) has become a key driving force for smart cities and economic growth. To address spectral efficiency and communication security challenges in LAE, this paper investigates secure energy efficiency (SEE) maximization using intelligent sky mirrors, UAV-mounted multifunctional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (MF-RIS) assisting nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. These aerial mirrors intelligently amplify legitimate signals while simultaneously generating jamming against eavesdroppers. We formulate a joint optimization problem encompassing UAV trajectory, base station power allocation, RIS phase shifts, amplification factors, and scheduling matrices. Given the fractional SEE objective and dynamic UAV scenarios, we propose a two-layer optimization scheme: SAC-driven first layer for trajectory and power management, and channel alignment-based second layer for phase optimization. Simulations demonstrate that our proposed scheme significantly outperforms benchmark approaches.

Title: Specific Multi-emitter Identification: Theoretical Limits and Low-complexity Design
Authors: Yuhao Chen, Boxiang He, Junshan Luo, Shilian Wang, Lei Yao, Jing Lei
Abstract: Specific emitter identification (SEI) distinguishes emitters by utilizing hardware-induced signal imperfections. However, conventional SEI techniques are primarily designed for single-emitter scenarios. This poses a fundamental limitation in distributed wireless networks, where simultaneous transmissions from multiple emitters result in overlapping signals that conventional single-emitter identification methods cannot effectively handle. To overcome this limitation, we present a specific multi-emitter identification (SMEI) framework via multi-label learning, treating identification as a problem of directly decoding emitter states from overlapping signals. Theoretically, we establish performance bounds using Fano's inequality. Methodologically, the multi-label formulation reduces output dimensionality from exponential to linear scale, thereby substantially decreasing computational complexity. Additionally, we propose an improved SMEI (I-SMEI), which incorporates multi-head attention to effectively capture features in correlated signal combinations. Experimental results demonstrate that SMEI achieves high identification accuracy with a linear computational complexity. Furthermore, the proposed I-SMEI scheme significantly improves identification accuracy across various overlapping scenarios compared to the proposed SMEI and other advanced methods.

Title: Rapid stabilization of the heat equation with localized disturbance
Authors: Patricio Guzmán, Hugo Parada (SPHINX, IECL), Christian Calle-Cárdenas
Abstract: This paper studies the rapid stabilization of a multidimensional heat equation in the presence of an unknown spatially localized disturbance. A novel multivalued feedback control strategy is proposed, which synthesizes the frequency Lyapunov method (introduced by Xiang [41]) with the sign multivalued operator. This methodology connects Lyapunov-based stability analysis with spectral inequalities, while the inclusion of the sign operator ensures robustness against the disturbance. The closed-loop system is governed by a differential inclusion, for which well-posedness is proved via the theory of maximal monotone operators. This approach not only guarantees exponential stabilization but also circumvents the need for explicit disturbance modeling or estimation.

Title: Energy Optimization for Time-of-Arrival Based Tracking
Authors: Luca Reggiani, Arnaldo Spalvieri
Abstract: The paper analyzes energy allocation in a scenario where the position of a moving target is tracked by exploiting the Time-of-Arrivals of bandwidth-constrained signals received by or transmitted from a fixed number of anchors located at known positions. The signal of each anchor is generated by transmitting a sequence of known symbols, allowing for amplitude and duration (number of symbols) to be different from anchor to anchor. The problem is the minimization of the sum of the energies of the transmitted signals imposing a constraint on the performance of the tracking procedure. Specifically, the constraint is the Posterior Cramer-Rao Bound, below the mean square error achieved by any unbiased estimator. The main improvement over the previous literature is the derivation of a formula that, at each step of the tracking, allows to calculate in closed form the first-order variation of the Posterior Cramer-Rao Bound as a function of the variation of the total energy. To concretely show the application of our approach, we present also two numerical algorithms that implement the constrained optimization in the case of signals of fixed amplitude and variable duration transmitted from the anchors in a time division multiplexing scheme.

Title: Semantic Communication for Rate-Limited Closed-Loop Distributed Communication-Sensing-Control Systems
Authors: Guangjin Pan, Zhixing Li, Ayça Özçelikkale, Christian Häger, Musa Furkan Keskin, Henk Wymeersch
Abstract: The growing integration of distributed integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) with closed-loop control in intelligent networks demands efficient information transmission under stringent bandwidth constraints. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a unified framework for goal-oriented semantic communication in distributed SCC systems. Building upon Weaver's three-level model, we establish a hierarchical semantic formulation with three error levels (L1: observation reconstruction, L2: state estimation, and L3: control) to jointly optimize their corresponding objectives. Based on this formulation, we propose a unified goal-oriented semantic compression and rate adaptation framework that is applicable to different semantic error levels and optimization goals across the SCC loop. A rate-limited multi-sensor LQR system is used as a case study to validate the proposed framework. We employ a GRU-based AE for semantic compression and a PPO-based rate adaptation algorithm that dynamically allocates transmission rates across sensors. Results show that the proposed framework effectively captures task-relevant semantics and adapts its resource allocation strategies across different semantic levels, thereby achieving level-specific performance gains under bandwidth constraints.

Title: Modular Landfill Remediation for AI Grid Resilience
Authors: Qi He, Chunyu Qu
Abstract: Rising AI electricity demand and persistent landfill methane emissions constitute coupled constraints on U.S. digital infrastructure and decarbonization. While China has achieved a rapid 'de-landfilling' transition through centralized coordination, the U.S. remains structurally 'locked in' to landfilling due to fragmented governance and carbon accounting incentives. This paper proposes a modular legacy landfill remediation framework to address these dual challenges within U.S. institutional constraints. By treating legacy sites as stock resources, the proposed system integrates excavation, screening, and behind-the-meter combined heat and power (CHP) to transform environmental liabilities into resilience assets. A system analysis of a representative AI corridor demonstrates that such modules can mitigate site-level methane by 60-70% and recover urban land, while supplying approximately 20 MW of firm, islandable power. Although contributing only approximately 5% of a hyperscale data center's bulk load, it provides critical microgrid resilience and black-start capability. We conclude that remediation-oriented waste-to-energy should be valued not as a substitute for bulk renewables, but as a strategic control volume for buffering critical loads against grid volatility while resolving long-term environmental liabilities.

Title: How is remifentanil dosed without dedicated indicator?
Authors: Bob Aubouin-Pairault (LAMIH), Mazen Alamir (GIPSA-MODUS, CNRS), Benjamin Meyer (CHUGA), Rémi Wolf (UGA UFRM), Kaouther Moussa (LAMIH)
Abstract: This study investigates the paradigm of intraoperative analgesic dosage using a data-driven approach based on retrospective clinical data. Remifentanil, an analgesic widely used during anesthesia, presents a dosing challenge due to the absence of an universally accepted indicator of analgesia. To examine how changes in patient state correlate with adjustments in remifentanil target concentration triggered by the practitioner, we analyzed data from two sources: VitalDB (Seoul, Korea) and PREDIMED (Grenoble, France). Results show that only features derived from arterial pressure are consistently associated with changes in remifentanil targets. This finding is robust across both datasets despite variations in specific thresholds. In particular, increases in remifentanil targets are associated with high or rising arterial pressure over short periods (1--2 minutes), whereas decreases are linked to low, stable, or declining arterial pressure over longer periods (5--7 minutes). By capturing anesthesiologists' dosing strategies we provide a foundation for the future development of closed-loop control algorithms. Beyond the specific example of remifentanil's change prediction, the proposed feature generation and associated sparse fitting approach can be applied to other domain where human decision can be viewed as sensors interpretation.

Title: Selective Phase-Aware Training of nnU-Net for Robust Breast Cancer Segmentation in Multi-Center DCE-MRI
Authors: Beyza Zayim, Aissiou Ikram, Boukhiar Naima
Abstract: Breast cancer remains the most common cancer among women and is a leading cause of female mortality. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) is a powerful imaging tool for evaluating breast tumors, yet the field lacks a standardized benchmark for analyzing treatment responses and guiding personalized care. We participated in the MAMA-MIA Challenge's Primary Tumor Segmentation task and this work presents a proposed selective, phase-aware training framework for the nnU-Net architecture, emphasizing quality-focused data selection to strengthen model robustness and generalization. We employed the No New Net (nnU-Net) framework with a selective training strategy that systematically analyzed the impact of image quality and center-specific variability on segmentation performance. Controlled experiments on the DUKE, NACT, ISPY1, and ISPY2 datasets revealed that including ISPY scans with motion artifacts and reduced contrast impaired segmentation performance, even with advanced preprocessing, such as contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE). In contrast, training on DUKE and NACT data, which exhibited clearer contrast and fewer motion artifacts despite varying resolutions, with early phase images (0000-0002) provided more stable training conditions. Our results demonstrate the importance of phase-sensitive and quality-aware training strategies in achieving reliable segmentation performance in heterogeneous clinical datasets, highlighting the limitations of the expansion of naive datasets and motivating the need for future automation of quality-based data selection strategies.

Title: Vision-Aided Relative State Estimation for Approach and Landing on a Moving Platform with Inertial Measurements
Authors: Tarek Bouazza, Alessandro Melis, Soulaimane Berkane, Robert Mahony, Tarek Hamel
Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of estimating the relative position, orientation, and velocity between a UAV and a planar platform undergoing arbitrary 3D motion during approach and landing. The estimation relies on measurements from Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) mounted on both systems, assuming there is a suitable communication channel to exchange data, together with visual information provided by an onboard monocular camera, from which the bearing (line-of-sight direction) to the platform's center and the normal vector of its planar surface are extracted. We propose a cascade observer with a complementary filter on SO(3) to reconstruct the relative attitude, followed by a linear Riccati observer for relative position and velocity estimation. Convergence of both observers is established under persistently exciting conditions, and the cascade is shown to be almost globally asymptotically and locally exponentially stable. We further extend the design to the case where the platform's rotation is restricted to its normal axis and show that its measured linear acceleration can be exploited to recover the remaining unobservable rotation angle. A sufficient condition to ensure local exponential convergence in this setting is provided. The performance of the proposed observers is validated through extensive simulations.

Title: Topology-based Conditions for Multiconsensus under the Signed Friedkin-Johnsen Model
Authors: Aashi Shrinate, Tanmay Siddharth, Twinkle Tripathy
Abstract: In this paper, we address the multiconsensus problem in networked systems, where agents are partitioned into disjoint subgroups and the states of agents within a subgroup are driven to consensus. Our objective is to present a distributed control law that leads to multiconsensus in signed digraphs. To this end, we examine the convergence of opinions under the opposing rule-based signed Friedkin-Johnsen (SFJ) model and present conditions that lead to multiconsensus under this model. Interestingly, the proposed conditions depend only on graph topology and signed interactions and not on the edge weights of the network. Consequently, the proposed SFJ-based control law relaxes the in-degree balance and homogeneity of trust-distrust, frequently assumed in the literature. Finally, we add simulation results to demonstrate the proposed conditions for multiconsensus.

Title: Anti-Malicious ISAC: How to Jointly Monitor and Disrupt Your Foes?
Authors: Zonghan Wang, Zahra Mobini, Hien Quoc Ngo, Hyundong Shin, Michail Matthaiou
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems are key enablers of future networks but raise significant security concerns. In this realm, the emergence of malicious ISAC systems has amplified the need for authorized parties to legitimately monitor suspicious communication links and protect legitimate targets from potential detection or exploitation by malicious foes. In this paper, we propose a new wireless proactive monitoring paradigm, where a legitimate monitor intercepts a suspicious communication link while performing cognitive jamming to enhance the monitoring success probability (MSP) and simultaneously safeguard the target. To this end, we derive closed-form expressions of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) at the user (UE), sensing access points (S-APs), and an approximating expression of the SINR at the proactive monitor. Moreover, we propose an optimization technique under which the legitimate monitor minimizes the success detection probability (SDP) of the legitimate target, by optimizing the jamming power allocation over both communication and sensing channels subject to total power constraints and monitoring performance requirement. To enhance the monitor's longevity and reduce the risk of detection by malicious ISAC systems, we further propose an adaptive power allocation scheme aimed at minimizing the total transmit power at the monitor while meeting a pre-selected sensing SINR threshold and ensuring successful monitoring. Our numerical results show that the proposed algorithm significantly compromises the sensing and communication performance of malicious ISAC.

Title: Stability Analysis of a B-Spline Deep Neural Operator for Nonlinear Systems
Authors: Raffaele Romagnoli, Soummya Kar
Abstract: This paper investigates the stability properties of neural operators through the structured representation offered by the Hybrid B-spline Deep Neural Operator (HBDNO). While existing stability-aware architectures typically enforce restrictive constraints that limit universality, HBDNO preserves full expressive power by representing outputs via B-spline control points. We show that these control points form a natural observable for post-training stability analysis. By applying Dynamic Mode Decomposition and connecting the resulting discrete dynamics to the Koopman operator framework, we provide a principled approach to spectral characterization of learned operators. Numerical results demonstrate the ability to assess stability and reveal future directions for safety-critical applications.

Title: ForeSpeed: A real-world video dataset of CCTV cameras with different settings for vehicle speed estimation
Authors: Massimo Iuliani, Blake Sawyer, Marco Fontani, David Spreadborough, Martino Jerian
Abstract: The need to estimate the speed of road vehicles has become increasingly important in the field of video forensics, particularly with the widespread deployment of CCTV cameras worldwide. Despite the development of various approaches, the accuracy of forensic speed estimation from real-world footage remains highly dependent on several factors, including camera specifications, acquisition methods, spatial and temporal resolution, compression methods, and scene perspective, which can significantly influence performance. In this paper, we introduce ForeSpeed, a comprehensive dataset designed to support the evaluation of speed estimation techniques in real-world scenarios using CCTV footage. The dataset includes recordings of a vehicle traveling at known speeds, captured by three digital and three analog cameras from two distinct perspectives. Real-world road metrics are provided to enable the restoration of the scene geometry. Videos were stored with multiple compression factors and settings, to simulate real world scenarios in which export procedures are not always performed according to forensic standards. Overall, ForeSpeed, includes a collection of 322 videos. As a case study, we employed the ForeSpeed dataset to benchmark a speed estimation algorithm available in a commercial product (Amped FIVE). Results demonstrate that while the method reliably estimates average speed across various conditions, its uncertainty range significantly increases when the scene involves strong perspective distortion. The ForeSpeed dataset is publicly available to the forensic community, with the aim of facilitating the evaluation of current methodologies and inspiring the development of new, robust solutions tailored to collision investigation and forensic incident analysis.

Title: Power feedback strategy based on efficiency trajectory analysis for HCPV sun tracking
Authors: Manuel G. Satué, Fernando Castaño, Manuel G. Ortega, Francisco R. Rubio
Abstract: This paper presents a control strategy for sun trackers which adapts continuously to different sources of error, avoiding the necessity of any kind of calibration by analyzing the produced electric power to sense the position of the Sun. The proposed strategy is able to meet the strict specifications for HCPV sun trackers despite of mechanical uncertainties (misalignments in the structure itself, misalignment of the solar modules with respect to the wing, etc.) and installation uncertainties (misalignments of the platform with respect to geographical north). Experimental results with an industrial-grade solar tracker showing the validity of the proposed control strategy under sunny and moderate cloudy conditions, as well as with different installation precisions by un-calibrating the system on purpose are exposed.

Title: Hybrid Analytical-Machine Learning Framework for Ripple Factor Estimation in Cockcroft-Walton Voltage Multipliers with Residual Correction for Non-Ideal Effects
Authors: Md. Tanvirul Islam
Abstract: Cockcroft-Walton (CW) voltage multipliers suffer from output ripple that classical analytical models underestimate due to neglected non-idealities like diode drops and capacitor ESR, particularly in high-stage, low-frequency and heavy-load regimes. This paper proposes a hybrid framework that generates a comprehensive 324-case MATLAB/Simulink dataset varying stages (2-8), input voltage (5-25 kV), capacitance (1-10 {\mu}F), frequency (50-500 Hz) and load (6-60 M{\Omega}), then trains a Random Forest model to predict residuals between simulated and theoretical peak-to-peak ripple. The approach achieves 70.6% RMSE reduction (131 V vs. 448 V) globally and 66.7% in critical regimes, with near-zero bias, enabling physically interpretable design optimization while outperforming pure ML in extrapolation reliability.

Title: Real-Time Streamable Generative Speech Restoration with Flow Matching
Authors: Simon Welker, Bunlong Lay, Maris Hillemann, Tal Peer, Timo Gerkmann
Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have greatly impacted the speech processing field in recent years, exhibiting high speech naturalness and spawning a new research direction. Their application in real-time communication is, however, still lagging behind due to their computation-heavy nature involving multiple calls of large DNNs. Here, we present this http URL, a frame-causal flow-based generative model with an algorithmic latency of 32 milliseconds (ms) and a total latency of 48 ms, paving the way for generative speech processing in real-time communication. We propose a buffered streaming inference scheme and an optimized DNN architecture, show how learned few-step numerical solvers can boost output quality at a fixed compute budget, explore model weight compression to find favorable points along a compute/quality tradeoff, and contribute a model variant with 24 ms total latency for the speech enhancement task. Our work looks beyond theoretical latencies, showing that high-quality streaming generative speech processing can be realized on consumer GPUs available today. this http URL can solve a variety of speech processing tasks in a streaming fashion: speech enhancement, dereverberation, codec post-filtering, bandwidth extension, STFT phase retrieval, and Mel vocoding. As we verify through comprehensive evaluations and a MUSHRA listening test, this http URL establishes a state-of-the-art for generative streaming speech restoration, exhibits only a reasonable reduction in quality compared to a non-streaming variant, and outperforms our recent work (Diffusion Buffer) on generative streaming speech enhancement while operating at a lower latency.

Title: A Gauss-Newton-Induced Structure-Exploiting Algorithm for Differentiable Optimal Control
Authors: Yuankun Chen, Zifei Nie, Xun Gong, Yunfeng Hu, Hong Chen
Abstract: Differentiable optimal control, particularly differentiable nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), provides a powerful framework that enjoys the complementary benefits of machine learning and control theory. A key enabler of differentiable optimal control is the computation of derivatives of the optimal trajectory with respect to problem parameters, i.e., trajectory derivatives. Previous works compute trajectory derivatives by solving a differential Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) system, and achieve this efficiently by constructing an equivalent auxiliary system. However, we find that directly exploiting the matrix structures in the differential KKT system yields significant computation speed improvements. Motivated by this insight, we propose FastDOC, which applies a Gauss-Newton approximation of Hessian and takes advantage of the resulting block-sparsity and positive semidefinite properties of the matrices involved. These structural properties enable us to accelerate the computationally expensive matrix factorization steps, resulting in a factor-of-two speedup in theoretical computational complexity, and in a synthetic benchmark FastDOC achieves up to a 180% time reduction compared to the baseline method. Finally, we validate the method on an imitation learning task for human-like autonomous driving, where the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FastDOC in practical applications.

Title: Exact Recourse Functions for Aggregations of EVs Operating in Imbalance Markets
Authors: Karan Mukhi, Licio Romao, Alessandro Abate
Abstract: We study optimal charging of large electric vehicle populations that are exposed to a single real-time imbalance price. The problem is naturally cast as a multistage stochastic linear programme (MSLP), which can be solved by algorithms such as Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming. However, these methods scale poorly with the number of devices and stages. This paper presents a novel approach to overcome this curse of dimensionality. Building prior work that characterises the aggregate flexibility sets of populations of EVs as a permutahdron, we reformulate the original problem in terms of aggregated quantities. The geometric structure of permutahedra lets us (i) construct an optimal disaggregation policy, (ii) derive an exact, lower-dimensional MSLP, and (iii) characterise the expected recourse function as piecewise affine with a finite, explicit partition. In particular, we provide closed-form expressions for the slopes and intercepts of each affine region via truncated expectations of future prices, yielding an exact form for the recourse function and first-stage policy. Comprehensive numerical studies validate our claims and demonstrate the practical utility of this work.

Title: Rethinking Coupled Tensor Analysis for Hyperspectral Super-Resolution: Recoverable Modeling Under Endmember Variability
Authors: Meng Ding, Xiao Fu
Abstract: This work revisits the hyperspectral super-resolution (HSR) problem, i.e., fusing a pair of spatially co-registered hyperspectral (HSI) and multispectral (MSI) images to recover a super-resolution image (SRI) that enhances the spatial resolution of the HSI. Coupled tensor decomposition (CTD)-based methods have gained traction in this domain, offering recoverability guarantees under various assumptions. Existing models such as canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) and Tucker decomposition provide strong expressive power but lack physical interpretability. The block-term decomposition model with rank-$(L_r, L_r, 1)$ terms (the LL1 model) yields interpretable factors under the linear mixture model (LMM) of spectral images, but LMM assumptions are often violated in practice -- primarily due to nonlinear effects such as endmember variability (EV). To address this, we propose modeling spectral images using a more flexible block-term tensor decomposition with rank-$(L_r, M_r, N_r)$ terms (the LMN model). This modeling choice retains interpretability, subsumes CPD, Tucker, and LL1 as special cases, and robustly accounts for non-ideal effects such as EV, offering a balanced tradeoff between expressiveness and interpretability for HSR. Importantly, under the LMN model for HSI and MSI, recoverability of the SRI can still be established under proper conditions -- providing strong theoretical support. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets further validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method compared with existing CTD-based approaches.

Title: Patlak Parametric Image Estimation from Dynamic PET Using Diffusion Model Prior
Authors: Ziqian Huang, Boxiao Yu, Siqi Li, Savas Ozdemir, Sangjin Bae, Jae Sung Lee, Guobao Wang, Kuang Gong
Abstract: Dynamic PET enables the quantitative estimation of physiology-related parameters and is widely utilized in research and increasingly adopted in clinical settings. Parametric imaging in dynamic PET requires kinetic modeling to estimate voxel-wise physiological parameters based on specific kinetic models. However, parametric images estimated through kinetic model fitting often suffer from low image quality due to the inherently ill-posed nature of the fitting process and the limited counts resulting from non-continuous data acquisition across multiple bed positions in whole-body PET. In this work, we proposed a diffusion model-based kinetic modeling framework for parametric image estimation, using the Patlak model as an example. The score function of the diffusion model was pre-trained on static total-body PET images and served as a prior for both Patlak slope and intercept images by leveraging their patch-wise similarity. During inference, the kinetic model was incorporated as a data-consistency constraint to guide the parametric image estimation. The proposed framework was evaluated on total-body dynamic PET datasets with different dose levels, demonstrating the feasibility and promising performance of the proposed framework in improving parametric image quality.

Title: Towards Reliable Connectivity: Measurement-Driven Assessment of Starlink and OneWeb Non-Terrestrial and 5G Terrestrial Networks
Authors: Alejandro Ramírez-Arroyo, O. S. Peñaherrera-Pulla, Preben Mogensen
Abstract: The emergence of commercial satellite communications networks, such as Starlink and OneWeb, has significantly transformed the communications landscape over the last years. As a complement to terrestrial cellular networks, non-terrestrial systems enable coverage extension and reliability enhancement beyond the limits of conventional infrastructure. Currently, the high reliance on terrestrial networks exposes communications to vulnerabilities in the event of terrestrial infrastructure failures, e.g., due to natural disasters. Therefore, this work proposes the joint evaluation of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for two non-terrestrial satellite networks (Starlink and OneWeb) and two terrestrial cellular networks to assess the current performance of these technologies across three different environments: (i) urban, (ii) suburban, and (iii) forest scenarios. Additionally, multi-connectivity techniques are explored to determine the benefits in connectivity when two technologies are used simultaneously. For instance, the outage probability of Starlink and OneWeb in urban areas is reduced from approximately 12-21\% to 2\% when both solutions are employed together. Finally, the joint analysis of KPIs in both terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks demonstrates that their integration enhances coverage, improves performance, and increases reliability, highlighting the benefits of combining satellite and terrestrial systems in the analyzed environments.

Title: Optimal-coupling-observer AV motion control securing comfort in the presence of cyber attacks
Authors: Farzam Tajdari, Georgios Papaioannou, Riender Happee
Abstract: The security of Automated Vehicles (AVs) is an important emerging area of research in traffic safety. Methods have been published and evaluated in experimental vehicles to secure safe AV control in the presence of attacks, but human motion comfort is rarely investigated in such studies. In this paper, we present an innovative optimal-coupling-observer-based framework that rejects the impact of bounded sensor attacks in a network of connected and automated vehicles from safety and comfort point of view. We demonstrate its performance in car following with cooperative adaptive cruise control for platoons with redundant distance and velocity sensors. The error dynamics are formulated as a Linear Time Variant (LTV) system, resulting in complex stability conditions that are investigated using a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) approach guaranteeing global asymptotic stability. We prove the capability of the framework to secure occupants' safety and comfort in the presence of bounded attacks. In the onset of attack, the framework rapidly detects attacked sensors and switches to the most reliable observer eliminating attacked sensors, even with modest attack magnitudes. Without our proposed method, severe (but bounded) attacks result in collisions and major discomfort. With our method, attacks had negligible effects on motion comfort evaluated using ISO-2631 Ride Comfort and Motion Sickness indexes. The results pave the path to bring comfort to the forefront of AVs security.

Title: CytoDINO: Risk-Aware and Biologically-Informed Adaptation of DINOv3 for Bone Marrow Cytomorphology
Authors: Aziz Muminov, Anne Pham
Abstract: Bone marrow cell cytomorphology analysis is critical for the diagnosis of hematological malignancies but remains a labor-intensive process subject to significant inter-observer variability. While recent foundation models have shown promise in computational pathology, they often require extensive computational resources and fail to account for the asymmetric risks associated with clinical misdiagnosis. We introduce CytoDINO, a framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Munich Leukemia Laboratory (MLL) dataset by fine-tuning DINOv3 using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our primary contribution is a novel Hierarchical Focal Loss with Critical Penalties, which encodes biological relationships between cell lineages and explicitly penalizes clinically dangerous misclassifications (e.g., classifying blasts as normal cells). CytoDINO achieves an 88.2% weighted F1 score and 76.5% macro F1 on a held-out test set of 21 cell classes. By utilizing parameter-efficient fine-tuning with only 8% trainable parameters on a single NVIDIA RTX 5080, we demonstrate that consumer-grade hardware can match specialized infrastructure. Furthermore, confidence-based selective prediction yields 99.5% accuracy on 67% of samples, suggesting a viable pathway for clinical deployment where high-uncertainty cases are flagged for expert review

Title: chatter: a Python library for applying information theory and AI/ML models to animal communication
Authors: Mason Youngblood
Abstract: The study of animal communication often involves categorizing units into types (e.g. syllables in songbirds, or notes in humpback whales). While this approach is useful in many cases, it necessarily flattens the complexity and nuance present in real communication systems. chatter is a new Python library for analyzing animal communication in continuous latent space using information theory and modern machine learning techniques. It is taxonomically agnostic, and has been tested with the vocalizations of birds, bats, whales, and primates. By leveraging a variety of different architectures, including variational autoencoders and vision transformers, chatter represents vocal sequences as trajectories in high-dimensional latent space, bypassing the need for manual or automatic categorization of units. The library provides an end-to-end workflow -- from preprocessing and segmentation to model training and feature extraction -- that enables researchers to quantify the complexity, predictability, similarity, and novelty of vocal sequences.

Title: FOODER: Real-time Facial Authentication and Expression Recognition
Authors: Sabri Mustafa Kahya, Muhammet Sami Yavuz, Boran Hamdi Sivrikaya, Eckehard Steinbach
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for the safe deployment of neural networks, as it enables the identification of samples outside the training domain. We present FOODER, a real-time, privacy-preserving radar-based framework that integrates OOD-based facial authentication with facial expression recognition. FOODER operates using low-cost frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar and exploits both range-Doppler and micro range-Doppler representations. The authentication module employs a multi-encoder multi-decoder architecture with Body Part (BP) and Intermediate Linear Encoder-Decoder (ILED) components to classify a single enrolled individual as in-distribution while detecting all other faces as OOD. Upon successful authentication, an expression recognition module is activated. Concatenated radar representations are processed by a ResNet block to distinguish between dynamic and static facial expressions. Based on this categorization, two specialized MobileViT networks are used to classify dynamic expressions (smile, shock) and static expressions (neutral, anger). This hierarchical design enables robust facial authentication and fine-grained expression recognition while preserving user privacy by relying exclusively on radar data. Experiments conducted on a dataset collected with a 60 GHz short-range FMCW radar demonstrate that FOODER achieves an AUROC of 94.13% and an FPR95 of 18.12% for authentication, along with an average expression recognition accuracy of 94.70%. FOODER outperforms state-of-the-art OOD detection methods and several transformer-based architectures while operating efficiently in real time.

Abstract: Perivascular spaces (PVS), when abnormally enlarged and visible in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) structural sequences, are important imaging markers of cerebral small vessel disease and potential indicators of neurodegenerative conditions. Despite their clinical significance, automatic enlarged PVS (EPVS) segmentation remains challenging due to their small size, variable morphology, similarity with other pathological features, and limited annotated datasets. This paper presents the EPVS Challenge organized at MICCAI 2024, which aims to advance the development of automated algorithms for EPVS segmentation across multi-site data. We provided a diverse dataset comprising 100 training, 50 validation, and 50 testing scans collected from multiple international sites (UK, Singapore, and China) with varying MRI protocols and demographics. All annotations followed the STRIVE protocol to ensure standardized ground truth and covered the full brain parenchyma. Seven teams completed the full challenge, implementing various deep learning approaches primarily based on U-Net architectures with innovations in multi-modal processing, ensemble strategies, and transformer-based components. Performance was evaluated using dice similarity coefficient, absolute volume difference, recall, and precision metrics. The winning method employed MedNeXt architecture with a dual 2D/3D strategy for handling varying slice thicknesses. The top solutions showed relatively good performance on test data from seen datasets, but significant degradation of performance was observed on the previously unseen Shanghai cohort, highlighting cross-site generalization challenges due to domain shift. This challenge establishes an important benchmark for EPVS segmentation methods and underscores the need for the continued development of robust algorithms that can generalize in diverse clinical settings.

Title: FedWiLoc: Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving WiFi Indoor Localization
Authors: Kanishka Roy, Tahsin Fuad Hasan, Chenfeng Wu, Eshwar Vangala, Roshan Ayyalasomayajula
Abstract: Current data-driven Wi-Fi-based indoor localization systems face three critical challenges: protecting user privacy, achieving accurate predictions in dynamic multipath environments, and generalizing across different deployments. Traditional Wi-Fi localization systems often compromise user privacy, particularly when facing compromised access points (APs) or man-in-the-middle attacks. As IoT devices proliferate in indoor environments, developing solutions that deliver accurate localization while robustly protecting privacy has become imperative. We introduce FedWiLoc, a privacy-preserving indoor localization system that addresses these challenges through three key innovations. First, FedWiLoc employs a split architecture where APs process Channel State Information (CSI) locally and transmit only privacy-preserving embedding vectors to user devices, preventing raw CSI exposure. Second, during training, FedWiLoc uses federated learning to collaboratively train the model across APs without centralizing sensitive user data. Third, we introduce a geometric loss function that jointly optimizes angle-of-arrival predictions and location estimates, enforcing geometric consistency to improve accuracy in challenging multipath conditions. Extensive evaluation across six diverse indoor environments spanning over 2,000 sq. ft. demonstrates that FedWiLoc outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 61.9% in median localization error while maintaining strong privacy guarantees throughout both training and inference.

Title: A Data-Centric Approach to Generalizable Speech Deepfake Detection
Authors: Wen Huang, Yuchen Mao, Yanmin Qian
Abstract: Achieving robust generalization in speech deepfake detection (SDD) remains a primary challenge, as models often fail to detect unseen forgery methods. While research has focused on model-centric and algorithm-centric solutions, the impact of data composition is often underexplored. This paper proposes a data-centric approach, analyzing the SDD data landscape from two practical perspectives: constructing a single dataset and aggregating multiple datasets. To address the first perspective, we conduct a large-scale empirical study to characterize the data scaling laws for SDD, quantifying the impact of source and generator diversity. To address the second, we propose the Diversity-Optimized Sampling Strategy (DOSS), a principled framework for mixing heterogeneous data with two implementations: DOSS-Select (pruning) and DOSS-Weight (re-weighting). Our experiments show that DOSS-Select outperforms the naive aggregation baseline while using only 3% of the total available data. Furthermore, our final model, trained on a 12k-hour curated data pool using the optimal DOSS-Weight strategy, achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming large-scale baselines with greater data and model efficiency on both public benchmarks and a new challenge set of various commercial APIs.

Title: Trustworthy and Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning for Safe and Energy-Efficient Process Control: A Use Case in Industrial Compressed Air Systems
Authors: Vincent Bezold, Patrick Wagner, Jakob Hofmann, Marco Huber, Alexander Sauer
Abstract: This paper presents a trustworthy reinforcement learning approach for the control of industrial compressed air systems. We develop a framework that enables safe and energy-efficient operation under realistic boundary conditions and introduce a multi-level explainability pipeline combining input perturbation tests, gradient-based sensitivity analysis, and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) feature attribution. An empirical evaluation across multiple compressor configurations shows that the learned policy is physically plausible, anticipates future demand, and consistently respects system boundaries. Compared to the installed industrial controller, the proposed approach reduces unnecessary overpressure and achieves energy savings of approximately 4\,\% without relying on explicit physics models. The results further indicate that system pressure and forecast information dominate policy decisions, while compressor-level inputs play a secondary role. Overall, the combination of efficiency gains, predictive behavior, and transparent validation supports the trustworthy deployment of reinforcement learning in industrial energy systems.

Title: Why Most Optimism Bandit Algorithms Have the Same Regret Analysis: A Simple Unifying Theorem
Authors: Vikram Krishnamurthy
Abstract: Several optimism-based stochastic bandit algorithms -- including UCB, UCB-V, linear UCB, and finite-arm GP-UCB -- achieve logarithmic regret using proofs that, despite superficial differences, follow essentially the same structure. This note isolates the minimal ingredients behind these analyses: a single high-probability concentration condition on the estimators, after which logarithmic regret follows from two short deterministic lemmas describing radius collapse and optimism-forced deviations. The framework yields unified, near-minimal proofs for these classical algorithms and extends naturally to many contemporary bandit variants.

Title: E-RGB-D: Real-Time Event-Based Perception with Structured Light
Authors: Seyed Ehsan Marjani Bajestani, Giovanni Beltrame
Abstract: Event-based cameras (ECs) have emerged as bio-inspired sensors that report pixel brightness changes asynchronously, offering unmatched speed and efficiency in vision sensing. Despite their high dynamic range, temporal resolution, low power consumption, and computational simplicity, traditional monochrome ECs face limitations in detecting static or slowly moving objects and lack color information essential for certain applications. To address these challenges, we present a novel approach that integrates a Digital Light Processing (DLP) projector, forming Active Structured Light (ASL) for RGB-D sensing. By combining the benefits of ECs and projection-based techniques, our method enables the detection of color and the depth of each pixel separately. Dynamic projection adjustments optimize bandwidth, ensuring selective color data acquisition and yielding colorful point clouds without sacrificing spatial resolution. This integration, facilitated by a commercial TI LightCrafter 4500 projector and a monocular monochrome EC, not only enables frameless RGB-D sensing applications but also achieves remarkable performance milestones. With our approach, we achieved a color detection speed equivalent to 1400 fps and 4 kHz of pixel depth detection, significantly advancing the realm of computer vision across diverse fields from robotics to 3D reconstruction methods.

Title: Analog Quantum Image Representation with Qubit-Frugal Encoding
Authors: Vikrant Sharma, Neel Kanth Kundu
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a fundamentally new paradigm for quantum image representation tailored for neutral-atom quantum devices. The proposed method constructs a qubit-efficient image representation by first applying a cartographic generalization algorithm to a classical edge-extracted input image, yielding a highly optimized sparse-dot based geometric description. While ensuring the structural integrity of the image, this sparse representation is then embedded into the atomic configuration of Aquila (QuEra Computing Inc.), modeled through the Bloqade simulation software stack. By encoding visual information through physical atom placement rather than digital basis-state coding, the approach avoids the costly state-preparation overhead inherent to digital quantum image processing circuits. Additionally, pruning sparse dot images, akin to map feature reduction, compresses representations without fidelity loss, thereby substantially reducing qubit requirements when implemented on an analog neutral-atom quantum device. The resulting quantum-native images have been successfully evaluated through matching tasks against an image database, thus illustrating the feasibility of this approach for image matching applications. Since sparse-dot image representations enable seamless generation of synthetic datasets, this work constitutes an initial step towards fully quantum-native machine-learning pipelines for visual data and highlights the potential of scalable analog quantum computing to enable resource-efficient alternatives to energy-intensive classical AI-based image processing frameworks.

Title: Prioritized Constraints in Optimization-Based Control
Authors: Daniel Arnström, Gianluca Garofalo
Abstract: We provide theoretical foundations and computational tools for the systematic design of optimization-based control laws with constraints that have different priorities. By introducing the concept of prioritized intersections, we extend and unify previous work on the topic. Moreover, to enable the use of prioritized intersection in real-time applications, we propose an efficient solver for forming such intersections for polyhedral constraints. The solver in question is a tailored implementation of a dual active-set quadratic programming solver that leverages the particular problem structure of the optimization problems arising for prioritized intersections. The method is validated in a real-time MPC application for autonomous driving, where it successfully resolves six different levels of conflicting constraints, confirming its efficiency and practicality for control. Furthermore, we show that the proposed solver outperforms existing solvers for hierarchical quadratic programming, making it relevant beyond control applications.

Title: The Illusion of Consistency: Selection-Induced Bias in Gated Kalman Innovation Statistics
Authors: Barak Or
Abstract: Validation gating is a fundamental component of classical Kalman-based tracking systems. Only measurements whose normalized innovation squared (NIS) falls below a prescribed threshold are considered for state update. While this procedure is statistically motivated by the chi-square distribution, it implicitly replaces the unconditional innovation process with a conditionally observed one, restricted to the validation event. This paper shows that innovation statistics computed after gating converge to gate-conditioned rather than nominal quantities. Under classical linear--Gaussian assumptions, we derive exact expressions for the first- and second-order moments of the innovation conditioned on ellipsoidal gating, and show that gating induces a deterministic, dimension-dependent contraction of the innovation covariance. The analysis is extended to NN association, which is shown to act as an additional statistical selection operator. We prove that selecting the minimum-norm innovation among multiple in-gate measurements introduces an unavoidable energy contraction, implying that nominal innovation statistics cannot be preserved under nontrivial gating and association. Closed-form results in the two-dimensional case quantify the combined effects and illustrate their practical significance.

Title: Comparing Dynamical Models Through Diffeomorphic Vector Field Alignment

Abstract: Dynamical systems models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are increasingly popular in theoretical neuroscience for hypothesis-generation and data analysis. Evaluating the dynamics in such models is key to understanding their learned generative mechanisms. However, such evaluation is impeded by two major challenges: First, comparison of learned dynamics across models is difficult because there is no enforced equivalence of their coordinate systems. Second, identification of mechanistically important low-dimensional motifs (e.g., limit sets) is intractable in high-dimensional nonlinear models such as RNNs. Here, we propose a comprehensive framework to address these two issues, termed Diffeomorphic vector field alignment FOR learned Models (DFORM). DFORM learns a nonlinear coordinate transformation between the state spaces of two dynamical systems, which aligns their trajectories in a maximally one-to-one manner. In so doing, DFORM enables an assessment of whether two models exhibit topological equivalence, i.e., similar mechanisms despite differences in coordinate systems. A byproduct of this method is a means to locate dynamical motifs on low-dimensional manifolds embedded within higher-dimensional systems. We verified DFORM's ability to identify linear and nonlinear coordinate transformations using canonical topologically equivalent systems, RNNs, and systems related by nonlinear flows. DFORM was also shown to provide a quantification of similarity between topologically distinct systems. We then demonstrated that DFORM can locate important dynamical motifs including invariant manifolds and saddle limit sets within high-dimensional models. Finally, using a set of RNN models trained on human functional MRI (fMRI) recordings, we illustrated that DFORM can identify limit cycles from high-dimensional data-driven models, which agreed well with prior numerical analysis.

Title: Real-Time Remote Monitoring of Correlated Markovian Sources
Authors: Mehrdad Salimnejad, Marios Kountouris, Nikolaos Pappas
Abstract: We investigate real-time tracking of two correlated stochastic processes over a shared wireless channel. The joint evolution of the processes is modeled as a two-dimensional discrete-time Markov chain. Each process is observed by a dedicated sampler and independently reconstructed at a remote monitor according to a task-specific objective. Although both processes originate from a common underlying phenomenon (e.g., distinct features of the same source), each monitor is interested only in its corresponding feature. A reconstruction error is incurred when the true and reconstructed states mismatch at one or both monitors. To address this problem, we propose an error-aware joint sampling and transmission policy, under which each sampler probabilistically generates samples only when the current process state differs from the most recently reconstructed state at its corresponding monitor. We adopt the time-averaged reconstruction error as the primary performance metric and benchmark the proposed policy against state-of-the-art joint sampling and transmission schemes. For each policy, we derive closed-form expressions for the resulting time-averaged reconstruction error. We further formulate and solve an optimization problem that minimizes the time-averaged reconstruction error subject to an average sampling cost constraint. Analytical and numerical results demonstrate that the proposed error-aware policy achieves the minimum time-averaged reconstruction error among the considered schemes while efficiently utilizing the sampling budget. The performance gains are particularly pronounced in regimes with strong inter-process correlation and stringent tracking requirements, where frequent sampling by both samplers is necessary.

Title: How Many Pinching Antennas Are Enough?
Authors: Dimitrios Tyrovolas, Sotiris A. Tegos, Yue Xiao, Panagiotis D. Diamantoulakis, Sotiris Ioannidis, Christos K. Liaskos, George K. Karagiannidis, Stylianos D. Asimonis
Abstract: Programmable wireless environments (PWEs) have emerged as a key paradigm for next-generation communication networks, aiming to transform wireless propagation from an uncontrollable phenomenon into a reconfigurable process that can adapt to diverse service requirements. In this framework, pinching-antenna systems (PASs) have recently been proposed as a promising enabling technology, as they allow the radiation location and effective propagation distance to be adjusted by selectively exciting radiating points along a dielectric waveguide. However, most existing studies on PASs rely on the idealized assumption that pinching-antenna (PA) positions can be continuously adjusted along the waveguide, while realistically only a finite set of pinching locations is available. Motivated by this, this paper analyzes the performance of two-state PASs, where the PA positions are fixed and only their activation state can be controlled. By explicitly accounting for the spatial discreteness of the available pinching points, closed-form analytical expressions for the outage probability and the ergodic achievable data rate are derived. In addition, we introduce the pinching discretization efficiency to quantify the performance gap between discrete and continuous pinching configurations, enabling a direct assessment of the number of PAs required to approximate the ideal continuous case. Finally, numerical results validate the analytical framework and show that near-continuous performance can be achieved with a limited number of PAs, offering useful insights for the design and deployment of PASs in PWEs.

Title: OPBO: Order-Preserving Bayesian Optimization
Authors: Wei Peng, Jianchen Hu, Kang Liu, Qiaozhu Zhai
Abstract: Bayesian optimization is an effective method for solving expensive black-box optimization problems. Most existing methods use Gaussian processes (GP) as the surrogate model for approximating the black-box objective function, it is well-known that it can fail in high-dimensional space (e.g., dimension over 500). We argue that the reliance of GP on precise numerical fitting is fundamentally ill-suited in high-dimensional space, where it leads to prohibitive computational complexity. In order to address this, we propose a simple order-preserving Bayesian optimization (OPBO) method, where the surrogate model preserves the order, instead of the value, of the black-box objective function. Then we can use a simple but effective OP neural network (NN) to replace GP as the surrogate model. Moreover, instead of searching for the best solution from the acquisition model, we select good-enough solutions in the ordinal set to reduce computational cost. The experimental results show that for high-dimensional (over 500) black-box optimization problems, the proposed OPBO significantly outperforms traditional BO methods based on regression NN and GP.

Abstract: Large speech generation models are evolving from single-speaker, short sentence synthesis to multi-speaker, long conversation geneartion. Current long-form speech generation models are predominately constrained to dyadic, turn-based interactions. To address this, we introduce JoyVoice, a novel anthropomorphic foundation model designed for flexible, boundary-free synthesis of up to eight speakers. Unlike conventional cascaded systems, JoyVoice employs a unified E2E-Transformer-DiT architecture that utilizes autoregressive hidden representations directly for diffusion inputs, enabling holistic end-to-end optimization. We further propose a MM-Tokenizer operating at a low bitrate of 12.5 Hz, which integrates multitask semantic and MMSE losses to effectively model both semantic and acoustic information. Additionally, the model incorporates robust text front-end processing via large-scale data perturbation. Experiments show that JoyVoice achieves state-of-the-art results in multilingual generation (Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean) and zero-shot voice cloning. JoyVoice achieves top-tier results on both the Seed-TTS-Eval Benchmark and multi-speaker long-form conversational voice cloning tasks, demonstrating superior audio quality and generalization. It achieves significant improvements in prosodic continuity for long-form speech, rhythm richness in multi-speaker conversations, paralinguistic naturalness, besides superior intelligibility.

Title: Optical design and characterization of a multi-depth vision simulator
Authors: Parviz Zolfaghari, Ehsan Varasteh, Koray Kavakli, Arda Gulersoy, Afsun Sahin, Hakan Urey
Abstract: We present a vision simulator device (Katsim), a compact near-eye optical display designed for assessing postoperative corrected vision, preoperative intraocular lens (IOL) assessment, and objective IOL characterization. The system forms a virtual image using an amplitude-modulated LCoS spatial light modulator (AM-SLM), RGB LED illumination, and a high-speed varifocal lens. In the proposed architecture, the LED illumination and varifocal lens diopter changes are triggered in synchrony with the SLM RGB subframes, rendering three depth planes perceptually simultaneously via high-frequency time-multiplexing. Operating at 60 frames per second (fps), the system achieves an effective 180 Hz depth-coded cycle, enabling sharp, multi-depth rendering within a dynamically adjustable depth range from 0.2 m to optical infinity. The system's eyebox is configurable from 1 to 5 mm, while maintaining a fixed spatial location and preserving angular magnification regardless of changes in focus or eyebox size. The designed system features a 9.15-degree field of view. An integrated infrared pupil-tracking module detects non-cataractous regions of the cataractous crystalline lens, and the projected imagery is mechanically steered through those clear zones in real time. The proposed vision simulator supports both subjective simulation of post-surgical vision for patient-specific counseling and objective optical evaluation of IOLs, including resolution and contrast fidelity (e.g., modulation transfer function, contrast transfer function, and defocus curves). By decoupling depth modulation from eyebox position and size, the system offers a modular, portable platform that supports enhanced preoperative planning, personalized IOL selection, objective IOL characterization, and use as a novel research vision tool.

Title: Finite-sample guarantees for data-driven forward-backward operator methods
Authors: Filippo Fabiani, Barbara Franci
Abstract: We establish finite sample certificates on the quality of solutions produced by data-based forward-backward (FB) operator splitting schemes. As frequently happens in stochastic regimes, we consider the problem of finding a zero of the sum of two operators, where one is either unavailable in closed form or computationally expensive to evaluate, and shall therefore be approximated using a finite number of noisy oracle samples. Under the lens of algorithmic stability, we then derive probabilistic bounds on the distance between a true zero and the FB output without making specific assumptions about the underlying data distribution. We show that under weaker conditions ensuring the convergence of FB schemes, stability bounds grow proportionally to the number of iterations. Conversely, stronger assumptions yield stability guarantees that are independent of the iteration count. We then specialize our results to a popular FB stochastic Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm and validate our theoretical bounds on a control problem for smart grids, where the energy price uncertainty is approximated by means of historical data.

Title: Time-Vertex Machine Learning for Optimal Sensor Placement in Temporal Graph Signals: Applications in Structural Health Monitoring
Authors: Keivan Faghih Niresi, Jun Qing, Mengjie Zhao, Olga Fink
Abstract: Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) plays a crucial role in maintaining the safety and resilience of infrastructure. As sensor networks grow in scale and complexity, identifying the most informative sensors becomes essential to reduce deployment costs without compromising monitoring quality. While Graph Signal Processing (GSP) has shown promise by leveraging spatial correlations among sensor nodes, conventional approaches often overlook the temporal dynamics of structural behavior. To overcome this limitation, we propose Time-Vertex Machine Learning (TVML), a novel framework that integrates GSP, time-domain analysis, and machine learning to enable interpretable and efficient sensor placement by identifying representative nodes that minimize redundancy while preserving critical information. We evaluate the proposed approach on two bridge datasets for damage detection and time-varying graph signal reconstruction tasks. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing SHM systems by providing a robust, adaptive, and efficient solution for sensor placement.

Title: Neural Implicit Heart Coordinates: 3D cardiac shape reconstruction from sparse segmentations
Authors: Marica Muffoletto, Uxio Hermida, Charlène Mauger, Avan Suinesiaputra, Yiyang Xu, Richard Burns, Lisa Pankewitz, Andrew D McCulloch, Steffen E Petersen, Daniel Rueckert, Alistair A Young
Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of cardiac anatomy from sparse clinical images remains a major challenge in patient-specific modeling. While neural implicit functions have previously been applied to this task, their application to mapping anatomical consistency across subjects has been limited. In this work, we introduce Neural Implicit Heart Coordinates (NIHCs), a standardized implicit coordinate system, based on universal ventricular coordinates, that provides a common anatomical reference frame for the human heart. Our method predicts NIHCs directly from a limited number of 2D segmentations (sparse acquisition) and subsequently decodes them into dense 3D segmentations and high-resolution meshes at arbitrary output resolution. Trained on a large dataset of 5,000 cardiac meshes, the model achieves high reconstruction accuracy on clinical contours, with mean Euclidean surface errors of 2.51$\pm$0.33 mm in a diseased cohort (n=4549) and 2.3$\pm$0.36 mm in a healthy cohort (n=5576). The NIHC representation enables anatomically coherent reconstruction even under severe slice sparsity and segmentation noise, faithfully recovering complex structures such as the valve planes. Compared with traditional pipelines, inference time is reduced from over 60 s to 5-15 s. These results demonstrate that NIHCs constitute a robust and efficient anatomical representation for patient-specific 3D cardiac reconstruction from minimal input data.

Title: Mixed formulation and structure-preserving discretization of Cosserat rod dynamics in a port-Hamiltonian framework
Authors: Philipp L. Kinon, Simon R. Eugster, Peter Betsch
Abstract: An energy-based modeling framework for the nonlinear dynamics of spatial Cosserat rods undergoing large displacements and rotations is proposed. The mixed formulation features independent displacement, velocity and stress variables and is further objective and locking-free. Finite rotations are represented using a director formulation that avoids singularities and yields a constant mass matrix. This results in an infinite-dimensional nonlinear port-Hamiltonian (PH) system governed by partial differential-algebraic equations with a quadratic energy functional. Using a time-differentiated compliance form of the stress-strain relations allows for the imposition of kinematic constraints, such as inextensibility or shear-rigidity. A structure-preserving finite element discretization leads to a finite-dimensional system with PH structure, thus facilitating the design of an energy-momentum consistent integration scheme. Dissipative material behavior (via the generalized-Maxwell model) and non-standard actuation approaches (via pneumatic chambers or tendons) integrate naturally into the framework. As illustrated by selected numerical examples, the present framework establishes a new approach to energy-momentum consistent formulations in computational mechanics involving finite rotations.

Title: Machine Learning of Temperature-dependent Chemical Kinetics Using Parallel Droplet Microreactors
Authors: Mamoru Saita, Yutaka Hori
Abstract: Temperature is a fundamental regulator of chemical and biochemical kinetics, yet capturing nonlinear thermal effects directly from experimental data remains a major challenge due to limited throughput and model flexibility. Recent advances in machine learning have enabled flexible modeling beyond conventional physical laws, but most existing strategies remain confined to surrogate models of end-point yields rather than full kinetic dynamics. Consequently, an end-to-end framework that unifies systematic kinetic data acquisition with machine learning based modeling has been lacking. In this paper, we present a unified framework that integrates droplet microfluidics with machine learning for the systematic analysis of temperature-dependent reaction kinetics. The platform is specifically designed to enable stable immobilization and long-term time-lapse imaging of thousands of droplets under dynamic thermal gradients. This configuration yields massively parallel time-resolved datasets across diverse temperature conditions that capture transient kinetics and provides particularly suitable inputs for training machine-learning models of reaction dynamics. Leveraging these datasets, we train Neural ODE models, which embed neural networks within differential equations to flexibly represent nonlinear temperature dependencies beyond conventional formulations. We demonstrate accurate prediction of enzymatic kinetics across diverse thermal environments, highlighting the robustness and versatility of the approach. Our framework bridges high-throughput experimental data acquisition with data-driven modeling, establishing a versatile foundation for enhanced predictive ability and rational analysis and design of temperature-sensitive biochemical processes.

Title: Fully Asynchronous Unsourced Random Access over Fading Channels
Authors: Mert Ozates, Mohammad Kazemi, Gianluigi Liva, Deniz Gündüz
Abstract: We examine unsourced random access in a fully asynchronous setup, where active users transmit their data without restriction on the start time over a fading channel. In the proposed scheme, the transmitted signal consists of a pilot sequence and a polar codeword, with the polar codeword distributed across the data part of the packet in an on-off pattern. The receiver uses a double sliding-window decoder, where the inner window employs iterative decoding with joint timing and pilot detection, channel estimation, single-user decoding, and successive interference cancellation to recover the message bits, while the outer window enhances interference cancellation. The numerical results indicate that the proposed scheme exhibits only a slight performance loss compared to the synchronous benchmark while being more applicable in practice.

Title: LeLaR: The First In-Orbit Demonstration of an AI-Based Satellite Attitude Controller
Authors: Kirill Djebko, Tom Baumann, Erik Dilger, Frank Puppe, Sergio Montenegro
Abstract: Attitude control is essential for many satellite missions. Classical controllers, however, are time-consuming to design and sensitive to model uncertainties and variations in operational boundary conditions. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising alternative by learning adaptive control strategies through autonomous interaction with a simulation environment. Overcoming the Sim2Real gap, which involves deploying an agent trained in simulation onto the real physical satellite, remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present the first successful in-orbit demonstration of an AI-based attitude controller for inertial pointing maneuvers. The controller was trained entirely in simulation and deployed to the InnoCube 3U nanosatellite, which was developed by the Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg in cooperation with the Technische Universität Berlin, and launched in January 2025. We present the AI agent design, the methodology of the training procedure, the discrepancies between the simulation and the observed behavior of the real satellite, and a comparison of the AI-based attitude controller with the classical PD controller of InnoCube. Steady-state metrics confirm the robust performance of the AI-based controller during repeated in-orbit maneuvers.

Title: MauBERT: Universal Phonetic Inductive Biases for Few-Shot Acoustic Units Discovery
Authors: Angelo Ortiz Tandazo, Manel Khentout, Youssef Benchekroun, Thomas Hueber, Emmanuel Dupoux
Abstract: This paper introduces MauBERT, a multilingual extension of HuBERT that leverages articulatory features for robust cross-lingual phonetic representation learning. We continue HuBERT pre-training with supervision based on a phonetic-to-articulatory feature mapping in 55 languages. Our models learn from multilingual data to predict articulatory features or phones, resulting in language-independent representations that capture multilingual phonetic properties. Through comprehensive ABX discriminability testing, we show MauBERT models produce more context-invariant representations than state-of-the-art multilingual self-supervised learning models. Additionally, the models effectively adapt to unseen languages and casual speech with minimal self-supervised fine-tuning (10 hours of speech). This establishes an effective approach for instilling linguistic inductive biases in self-supervised speech models.

Title: An overview of systems-theoretic guarantees in data-driven model predictive control
Authors: Julian Berberich, Frank Allgöwer
Abstract: The development of control methods based on data has seen a surge of interest in recent years. When applying data-driven controllers in real-world applications, providing theoretical guarantees for the closed-loop system is of crucial importance to ensure reliable operation. In this review, we provide an overview of data-driven model predictive control (MPC) methods for controlling unknown systems with guarantees on systems-theoretic properties such as stability, robustness, and constraint satisfaction. The considered approaches rely on the Fundamental Lemma from behavioral theory in order to predict input-output trajectories directly from data. We cover various setups, ranging from linear systems and noise-free data to more realistic formulations with noise and nonlinearities, and we provide an overview of different techniques to ensure guarantees for the closed-loop system. Moreover, we discuss avenues for future research that may further improve the theoretical understanding and practical applicability of data-driven MPC.

Title: Constant Modulus Waveform Design with Space-Time Sidelobe Reduction for DFRC Systems
Authors: Byunghyun Lee, Anindya Bijoy Das, David Love, Christopher Brinton, James Krogmeier
Abstract: Dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) is a key enabler of location-based services for next-generation communication systems. In this paper, we investigate the problem of designing constant modulus multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) waveforms for DFRC systems. We jointly shape the spatial beam pattern and ambiguity function of the transmit space-time matrix to improve target localization accuracy and enhance target resolution in cluttered environments. For communications, we employ constructive interference (CI)-based precoding, which exploits multi-user and radar-induced interference to enhance MIMO symbol detection. We develop two novel solution algorithms based on majorization-minimization (MM) and the linearized alternating direction method of multipliers (LADMM) principles. For the MM approach, we introduce a novel diagonal majorizer for complex quadratic functions, yielding a tighter surrogate and faster convergence than standard largest eigenvalue-based surrogates. After majorization, we decompose the approximated problem into independent subproblems that can be efficiently solved via parallelizable coordinate descent. To accommodate large MIMO dimensions, we further develop a low-complexity LADMM solution. We combine a biconvex reformulation and first-order proximal approximations to handle the nonconvex quartic objective without requiring costly matrix inversions. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in comparison to the existing DFRC algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can substantially enhance target detection and imaging performance due to the reduction of space-time sidelobes.

Title: High Frequency Matters: Uncertainty Guided Image Compression with Wavelet Diffusion
Authors: Juan Song, Jiaxiang He, Lijie Yang, Mingtao Feng, Keyan Wang
Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models have recently achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality images. However, balancing high perceptual quality and low distortion remains challenging in application of diffusion models in image compression. To address this issue, we propose a novel Uncertainty-Guided image compression approach with wavelet Diffusion (UGDiff). Our approach focuses on high frequency compression via the wavelet transform, since high frequency components are crucial for reconstructing image details. We introduce a wavelet conditional diffusion model for high frequency prediction, followed by a residual codec that compresses and transmits prediction residuals to the decoder. This diffusion prediction-then-residual compression paradigm effectively addresses the low fidelity issue common in direct reconstructions by existing diffusion models. Considering the uncertainty from the random sampling of the diffusion model, we further design an uncertainty-weighted rate-distortion (R-D) loss tailored for residual compression, providing a more rational trade-off between rate and distortion. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of UGDiff, surpassing state-of-the-art image compression methods in R-D performance, perceptual quality, subjective quality, and inference time.

Title: Activity-dependent resolution adjustment for radar-based human activity recognition
Authors: Do-Hyun Park, Min-Wook Jeon, Hyoung-Nam Kim
Abstract: The rising demand for detecting hazardous situations has led to increased interest in radar-based human activity recognition (HAR). Conventional radar-based HAR methods predominantly rely on micro-Doppler spectrograms for recognition tasks. However, conventional spectrograms employ a fixed resolution regardless of the varying characteristics of human activities, leading to limited representation of micro-Doppler signatures. To address this limitation, we propose a time-frequency domain representation method that adaptively adjusts the resolution based on activity characteristics. This approach adaptively adjusts the spectrogram resolution in a nonlinear manner, emphasizing frequency ranges that vary with activity intensity and are critical to capturing micro-Doppler signatures. We validate the proposed method by training deep learning-based HAR models on datasets generated using our adaptive representation. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained with our method achieve superior recognition accuracy compared to those trained with conventional methods.

Title: Chip-Surface Based Visual Authentication for Integrated Circuits
Authors: Runze Liu, Prasun Datta, Anirudh Nakra, Chau-Wai Wong, Min Wu
Abstract: The rapid development of the semiconductor industry and the ubiquity of electronic devices have led to a significant increase in the counterfeiting of integrated circuits (ICs). This poses a major threat to public health, the banking industry, and military defense sectors that are heavily reliant on electronic systems. The electronic physically unclonable functions (PUFs) are widely used to authenticate IC chips at the unit level. However, electronic PUFs are limited by their requirement for IC chips to be in working status for measurements and their sensitivity to environmental variations. This paper proposes using optical PUFs for IC chip authentication by leveraging the unique microscopic structures of the packaging surface of individual IC chips. The proposed method relies on color images of IC chip surfaces acquired using a flatbed scanner or mobile camera. Our initial study reveals that these consumer-grade imaging devices can capture meaningful physical features from IC chip surfaces. We then propose an efficient, lightweight verification scheme leveraging specular-reflection-based features extracted from videos, achieving an equal error rate (EER) of 0.0008. We conducted factor, sensitivity, and ablation studies to understand the detailed characteristics of the proposed lightweight verification scheme. Our work is the first to apply the optical PUF principle for the authentication of IC chips, synergizing image and video processing with semiconductor chip technology and demonstrating the potential to significantly enhance the security of the semiconductor supply chain.

Title: PIGUIQA: A Physical Imaging Guided Perceptual Framework for Underwater Image Quality Assessment
Authors: Weizhi Xian, Mingliang Zhou, Leong Hou U, Zhengguo Li
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Physical Imaging Guided perceptual framework for Underwater Image Quality Assessment (UIQA), termed PIGUIQA. First, we formulate UIQA as a comprehensive problem that considers the combined effects of direct transmission attenuation and backward scattering on image perception. By leveraging underwater radiative transfer theory, we systematically integrate physics-based imaging estimations to establish quantitative metrics for these distortions. Second, recognizing spatial variations in image content significance and human perceptual sensitivity to distortions, we design a module built upon a neighborhood attention mechanism for local perception of images. This module effectively captures subtle features in images, thereby enhancing the adaptive perception of distortions on the basis of local information. Third, by employing a global perceptual aggregator that further integrates holistic image scene with underwater distortion information, the proposed model accurately predicts image quality scores. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PIGUIQA achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining robust cross-dataset generalizability. The implementation is publicly available at this https URL

Title: Informativity Conditions for Multiple Signals: Properties, Experimental Design, and Applications (extended version)
Authors: Ao Cao, Fuyong Wang
Abstract: Recent studies highlight the importance of persistently exciting condition in single signal sequence for model identification and data-driven control methodologies. However, maintaining prolonged excitation in control signals introduces significant challenges, as continuous excitation can reduce the lifetime of mechanical devices. In this paper, we introduce three informativity conditions for various types of multi-signal data, each augmented by weight factors. We explore the interrelations between these conditions and their rank properties in linear time-invariant systems. Furthermore, we introduce open-loop experimental design methods tailored to each of the three conditions, which can synthesize the required excitation conditions either offline or online, even in the presence of limited information within each signal segment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these informativity conditions in least-squares identification. Additionally, all three conditions can extend Willems' fundamental lemma and are utilized to assess the properties of the system. Illustrative examples confirm that these conditions yield satisfactory outcomes in both least-squares identification and the construction of data-driven controllers.

Title: A Comprehensive Survey on Generative AI for Video-to-Music Generation
Authors: Shulei Ji, Songruoyao Wu, Zihao Wang, Shuyu Li, Kejun Zhang
Abstract: The burgeoning growth of video-to-music generation can be attributed to the ascendancy of multimodal generative models. However, there is a lack of literature that comprehensively combs through the work in this field. To fill this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive review of video-to-music generation using deep generative AI techniques, focusing on three key components: conditioning input construction, conditioning mechanism, and music generation frameworks. We categorize existing approaches based on their designs for each component, clarifying the roles of different strategies. Preceding this, we provide a fine-grained categorization of video and music modalities, illustrating how different categories influence the design of components within the generation pipelines. Furthermore, we summarize available multimodal datasets and evaluation metrics while highlighting ongoing challenges in the field.

Title: Data-Driven Nonconvex Reachability Analysis using Exact Multiplication
Authors: Zhen Zhang, M. Umar B. Niazi, Michelle S. Chong, Karl H. Johansson, Amr Alanwar
Abstract: This paper addresses a fundamental challenge in data-driven reachability analysis: accurately representing and propagating non-convex reachable sets. We propose a novel approach using constrained polynomial zonotopes to describe reachable sets for unknown LTI systems. Unlike constrained zonotopes commonly used in existing literature, constrained polynomial zonotopes are closed under multiplication with constrained matrix zonotopes. We leverage this property to develop an exact multiplication method that preserves the non-convex geometry of reachable sets without resorting to approximations. We demonstrate that our approach provides tighter over-approximations of reachable sets for LTI systems compared to conventional methods.

Title: Peer-Aware Cost Estimation in Nonlinear General-Sum Dynamic Games for Mutual Learning and Intent Inference
Authors: Seyed Yousef Soltanian, Wenlong Zhang
Abstract: Dynamic game theory is a powerful tool in modeling multi-agent interactions and human-robot systems. In practice, since the objective functions of both agents may not be explicitly known to each other, these interactions can be modeled as incomplete-information general-sum dynamic games. Solving for equilibrium policies for such games presents a major challenge, especially if the games involve nonlinear underlying dynamics. To simplify the problem, existing work often assumes that one agent is an expert with complete information about its peer, which can lead to biased estimates and failures in coordination. To address this challenge, we propose a nonlinear peer-aware cost estimation (N-PACE) algorithm for general-sum dynamic games. In N-PACE, using iterative linear quadratic (ILQ) approximation of dynamic games, each agent explicitly models the learning dynamics of its peer agent while inferring their objective functions and updating its own control policy accordingly in real time, which leads to unbiased and fast learning of the unknown objective function of the peer agent. Additionally, we demonstrate how N-PACE enables intent communication by explicitly modeling the peer's learning dynamics. Finally, we show how N-PACE outperforms baseline methods that disregard the learning behavior of the other agent, both analytically and using our case studies

Title: Neural Controller for Incremental Stability of Unknown Continuous-time Systems
Authors: Ahan Basu, Bhabani Shankar Dey, Pushpak Jagtap
Abstract: This work primarily focuses on synthesizing a controller that guarantees an unknown continuous-time system to be incrementally input-to-state stable ($\delta$-ISS). In this context, the notion of $\delta$-ISS control Lyapunov function ($\delta$-ISS-CLF) for the continuous-time system is introduced. Combined with the controller, the $\delta$-ISS-CLF guarantees that the system is incrementally stable. As the paper deals with unknown dynamical systems, the controller as well as the $\delta$-ISS-CLF are parametrized using neural networks. The data set used to train the neural networks is generated from the state space of the system by proper sampling. Now, to give a formal guarantee that the controller makes the system incrementally stable, we develop a validity condition by having some Lipschitz continuity assumptions and incorporate the condition into the training framework to ensure a provable correctness guarantee at the end of the training process. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through several case studies: a scalar system with a non-affine, non-polynomial structure, a one-link manipulator system, a nonlinear Moore-Greitzer model of a jet engine, a magnetic levitator system and a rotating rigid spacecraft model.

Title: Cross-organ all-in-one parallel compressed sensing magnetic resonance imaging
Authors: Baoshun Shi, Xin Meng, Shuangni Lv, Zheng Liu, Yan Yang
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning-based parallel compressed sensing magnetic resonance imaging (p-CSMRI) have significantly improved reconstruction quality. However, current p-CSMRI methods often require training separate deep neural network (DNN) for each organ due to anatomical variations, creating a barrier to developing generalized medical image reconstruction systems. To address this, we propose CAPNet (cross-organ all-in-one deep unfolding p-CSMRI network), a unified framework that implements a p-CSMRI iterative algorithm via three specialized modules: auxiliary variable module, prior module, and data consistency module. Recognizing that p-CSMRI systems often employ varying sampling ratios for different organs, resulting in organ-specific artifact patterns, we introduce an artifact generator, which extracts and integrates artifact features into the data consistency module to enhance the discriminative ability of the overall network. For the prior module, we design an organ structure-prompt generation submodule that leverages structural features extracted from the segment anything model (SAM) to create cross-organ prompts. These prompts are strategically incorporated into the prior module through an organ structure-aware Mamba submodule. Comprehensive evaluations on a cross-organ dataset confirm that CAPNet achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance across multiple anatomical structures using a single unified model. Our code will be published at this https URL.

Title: Reproducing and Improving CheXNet: Deep Learning for Chest X-ray Disease Classification
Authors: Daniel J. Strick, Carlos Garcia, Anthony Huang, Thomas Gardos
Abstract: Deep learning for radiologic image analysis is a rapidly growing field in biomedical research and is likely to become a standard practice in modern medicine. On the publicly available NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset, containing X-ray images that are classified by the presence or absence of 14 different diseases, we reproduced an algorithm known as CheXNet, as well as explored other algorithms that outperform CheXNet's baseline metrics. Model performance was primarily evaluated using the F1 score and AUC-ROC, both of which are critical metrics for imbalanced, multi-label classification tasks in medical imaging. The best model achieved an average AUC-ROC score of 0.85 and an average F1 score of 0.39 across all 14 disease classifications present in the dataset.

Title: A Tutorial on Beyond-Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: Modeling, Architectures, System Design and Optimization, and Applications
Authors: Hongyu Li, Matteo Nerini, Shanpu Shen, Bruno Clerckx
Abstract: Written by its inventors, this first tutorial on Beyond-Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (BD-RISs) provides the readers with the basics and fundamental tools necessary to appreciate, understand, and contribute to this emerging and disruptive technology. Conventional (Diagonal) RISs (D-RISs) are characterized by a diagonal scattering matrix $\mathbf{\Theta}$ such that the wave manipulation flexibility of D-RIS is extremely limited. In contrast, BD-RIS refers to a novel and general framework for RIS where its scattering matrix is not limited to be diagonal (hence, the ``beyond-diagonal'' terminology) and consequently, all entries of $\mathbf{\Theta}$ can potentially help shaping waves for much higher manipulation flexibility. This physically means that BD-RIS can artificially engineer and reconfigure coupling across elements of the surface thanks to inter-element reconfigurable components which allow waves absorbed by one element to flow through other elements. Consequently, BD-RIS opens the door to more general and versatile intelligent surfaces that subsumes existing RIS architectures as special cases. In this tutorial, we share all the secret sauce to model, design, and optimize BD-RIS and make BD-RIS transformative in many different applications. Topics discussed include physics-consistent and multi-port network-aided modeling; transmitting, reflecting, hybrid, and multi-sector mode analysis; reciprocal and non-reciprocal architecture designs and optimal performance-complexity Pareto frontier of BD-RIS; signal processing, optimization, and channel estimation for BD-RIS; hardware impairments (discrete-value impedance and admittance, lossy interconnections and components, wideband effects, mutual coupling) of BD-RIS; benefits and applications of BD-RIS in communications, sensing, power transfer.

Title: BattBee: Equivalent Circuit Modeling and Early Detection of Thermal Runaway Triggered by Internal Short Circuits for Lithium-Ion Batteries
Authors: Sangwon Kang, Hao Tu, Huazhen Fang
Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are the enabling power source for transportation electrification. However, in real-world applications, they remain vulnerable to internal short circuits (ISCs) and the consequential risk of thermal runaway (TR). Toward addressing the challenge of ISCs and TR, we undertake a systematic study that extends from dynamic modeling to fault detection in this paper. First, we develop {\em BattBee}, the first equivalent circuit model to specifically describe the onset of ISCs and the evolution of subsequently induced TR. Drawing upon electrochemical modeling, the model can simulate ISCs at different severity levels and predict their impact on the initiation and progression of TR events. With the physics-inspired design, this model offers strong physical interpretability and predictive accuracy, while maintaining structural simplicity to allow fast computation. Then, building upon the BattBee model, we develop fault detection observers and derive detection criteria together with decision-making logics to identify the occurrence and emergence of ISC and TR events. This detection approach is principled in design and fast in computation, lending itself to practical applications. Validation based on simulations and experimental data demonstrates the effectiveness of both the BattBee model and the ISC/TR detection approach. The research outcomes underscore this study's potential for real-world battery safety risk management.

Title: OrthoInsight: Rib Fracture Diagnosis and Report Generation Based on Multi-Modal Large Models
Authors: Jinzhi Wang, Jiangbo Zhang, Chenzhan Yu, Zhigang Xiu, Duwei Dai, Ziyu xu, Ningyong Wu, Wenhong Zhao
Abstract: The growing volume of medical imaging data has increased the need for automated diagnostic tools, especially for musculoskeletal injuries like rib fractures, commonly detected via CT scans. Manual interpretation is time-consuming and error-prone. We propose OrthoInsight, a multi-modal deep learning framework for rib fracture diagnosis and report generation. It integrates a YOLOv9 model for fracture detection, a medical knowledge graph for retrieving clinical context, and a fine-tuned LLaVA language model for generating diagnostic reports. OrthoInsight combines visual features from CT images with expert textual data to deliver clinically useful outputs. Evaluated on 28,675 annotated CT images and expert reports, it achieves high performance across Diagnostic Accuracy, Content Completeness, Logical Coherence, and Clinical Guidance Value, with an average score of 4.28, outperforming models like GPT-4 and Claude-3. This study demonstrates the potential of multi-modal learning in transforming medical image analysis and providing effective support for radiologists.

Title: ASR-Synchronized Speaker-Role Diarization
Authors: Arindam Ghosh, Mark Fuhs, Bongjun Kim, Anurag Chowdhury, Monika Woszczyna
Abstract: Speaker-role diarization (RD), such as doctor vs. patient or lawyer vs. client, is practically often more useful than conventional speaker diarization (SD), which assigns only generic labels (speaker-1, speaker-2). The state-of-the-art end-to-end ASR+RD approach uses a single transducer that serializes word and role predictions (role at the end of a speaker's turn), but at the cost of degraded ASR performance. To address this, we adapt a recent joint ASR+SD framework to ASR+RD by freezing the ASR transducer and training an auxiliary RD transducer in parallel to assign a role to each ASR-predicted word. For this, we first show that SD and RD are fundamentally different tasks, exhibiting different dependencies on acoustic and linguistic information. Motivated by this, we propose (1) task-specific predictor networks and (2) using higher-layer ASR encoder features as input to the RD encoder. Additionally, we replace the blank-shared RNNT loss by cross-entropy loss along the 1-best forced-alignment path to further improve performance while reducing computational and memory requirements during RD training. Experiments on a public and a private dataset of doctor-patient conversations demonstrate that our method outperforms the best baseline with relative reductions of 6.2% and 4.5% in role-based word diarization error rate (R-WDER), respectively

Title: Deep Equilibrium Convolutional Sparse Coding for Hyperspectral Image Denoising
Authors: Jin Ye, Jingran Wang, Fengchao Xiong, Jingzhou Chen, Yuntao Qian
Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSIs) play a crucial role in remote sensing but are often degraded by complex noise patterns. Ensuring the physical property of the denoised HSIs is vital for robust HSI denoising, giving the rise of deep unfolding-based methods. However, these methods map the optimization of a physical model to a learnable network with a predefined depth, which lacks convergence guarantees. In contrast, Deep Equilibrium (DEQ) models treat the hidden layers of deep networks as the solution to a fixed-point problem and models them as infinite-depth networks, naturally consistent with the optimization. Under the framework of DEQ, we propose a Deep Equilibrium Convolutional Sparse Coding (DECSC) framework that unifies local spatial-spectral correlations, nonlocal spatial self-similarities, and global spatial consistency for robust HSI denoising. Within the convolutional sparse coding (CSC) framework, we enforce shared 2D convolutional sparse representation to ensure global spatial consistency across bands, while unshared 3D convolutional sparse representation captures local spatial-spectral details. To further exploit nonlocal self-similarities, a transformer block is embedded after the 2D CSC. Additionally, a detail enhancement module is integrated with the 3D CSC to promote image detail preservation. We formulate the proximal gradient descent of the CSC model as a fixed-point problem and transform the iterative updates into a learnable network architecture within the framework of DEQ. Experimental results demonstrate that our DECSC method achieves superior denoising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Title: A Synoptic Review of High-Frequency Oscillations as a Biomarker in Neurodegenerative Disease
Authors: Samin Yaser, Mahad Ali, Yang Jiang, VP Nguyen, Jing Xiang, Laura J. Brattain
Abstract: High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs), rapid bursts of brain activity above 80 Hz, have emerged as a highly specific biomarker for epileptogenic tissue. Recent evidence suggests that HFOs are also present in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), reflecting underlying network hyperexcitability and offering a promising, noninvasive tool for early diagnosis and disease tracking. This synoptic review provides a comprehensive analysis of publicly available electroencephalography (EEG) datasets relevant to HFO research in neurodegenerative disorders. We conducted a bibliometric analysis of 1,222 articles, revealing a significant and growing research interest in HFOs, particularly within the last ten years. We then systematically profile and compare key public datasets, evaluating their participant cohorts, data acquisition parameters, and accessibility, with a specific focus on their technical suitability for HFO analysis. Our comparative synthesis highlights critical methodological heterogeneity across datasets, particularly in sampling frequency and recording paradigms, which poses challenges for cross-study validation, but also offers opportunities for robustness testing. By consolidating disparate information, clarifying nomenclature, and providing a detailed methodological framework, this review serves as a guide for researchers aiming to leverage public data to advance the role of HFOs as a cross-disease biomarker for AD and related conditions.

Title: Understanding Benefits and Pitfalls of Current Methods for the Segmentation of Undersampled MRI Data
Authors: Jan Nikolas Morshuis, Matthias Hein, Christian F. Baumgartner
Abstract: MR imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool allowing to non-invasively visualize patient anatomy and pathology with high soft-tissue contrast. However, MRI acquisition is typically time-consuming, leading to patient discomfort and increased costs to the healthcare system. Recent years have seen substantial research effort into the development of methods that allow for accelerated MRI acquisition while still obtaining a reconstruction that appears similar to the fully-sampled MR image. However, for many applications a perfectly reconstructed MR image may not be necessary, particularly, when the primary goal is a downstream task such as segmentation. This has led to growing interest in methods that aim to perform segmentation directly on accelerated MRI data. Despite recent advances, existing methods have largely been developed in isolation, without direct comparison to one another, often using separate or private datasets, and lacking unified evaluation standards. To date, no high-quality, comprehensive comparison of these methods exists, and the optimal strategy for segmenting accelerated MR data remains unknown. This paper provides the first unified benchmark for the segmentation of undersampled MRI data comparing 7 approaches. A particular focus is placed on comparing \textit{one-stage approaches}, that combine reconstruction and segmentation into a unified model, with \textit{two-stage approaches}, that utilize established MRI reconstruction methods followed by a segmentation network. We test these methods on two MRI datasets that include multi-coil k-space data as well as a human-annotated segmentation ground-truth. We find that simple two-stage methods that consider data-consistency lead to the best segmentation scores, surpassing complex specialized methods that are developed specifically for this task.

Title: Predictive Communications for Low-Altitude Networks
Authors: Junting Chen, Bowen Li, Hao Sun, Shuguang Cui, Nikolaos Pappas
Abstract: The emergence of dense, mission-driven aerial networks supporting the low-altitude economy presents unique communication challenges, including extreme channel dynamics and severe cross-tier interference. Traditional reactive communication paradigms are ill-suited to these environments, as they fail to leverage the network's inherent predictability. This paper introduces predictive communication, a novel paradigm transforming network management from reactive adaptation to proactive optimization. The approach is enabled by fusing predictable mission trajectories with stable, large-scale radio environment models (e.g., radio maps). Specifically, we present a hierarchical framework that decomposes the predictive cross-layer resource allocation problem into three layers: strategic (routing), tactical (timing), and operational (power). This structure aligns decision-making timescales with the accuracy levels and ranges of available predictive information. We demonstrate that this foresight-driven framework achieves an order-of-magnitude reduction in cross-tier interference, laying the groundwork for robust and scalable low-altitude communication systems.

Title: Closing the Loop Inside Neural Networks: Causality-Guided Layer Adaptation for Fault Recovery Control
Authors: Mahdi Taheri, Soon-Jo Chung, Fred Y. Hadaegh
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of real-time fault recovery control for nonlinear control-affine systems subject to actuator loss of effectiveness faults and external disturbances. We derive a two-stage framework that combines causal inference with selective online adaptation to achieve an effective learning-based recovery control method. In the offline phase, we develop a causal layer attribution technique based on the average causal effect (ACE) to evaluate the relative importance of each layer in a pretrained deep neural network (DNN) controller compensating for faults. This methodology identifies a subset of high-impact layers responsible for robust fault compensation. In the online phase, we deploy a Lyapunov-based gradient update to adapt only the ACE-selected layer to circumvent the need for full-network or last-layer only updates. The proposed adaptive controller guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) with exponential convergence of the closed-loop system in the presence of actuator faults and external disturbances. Compared to conventional adaptive DNN controllers with full-network adaptation, our methodology has a reduced computational overhead. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology, a case study is provided on a 3-axis attitude control system of a spacecraft with four reaction wheels.

Title: MeanVC: Lightweight and Streaming Zero-Shot Voice Conversion via Mean Flows
Authors: Guobin Ma, Jixun Yao, Ziqian Ning, Yuepeng Jiang, Lingxin Xiong, Lei Xie, Pengcheng Zhu
Abstract: Zero-shot voice conversion (VC) aims to transfer timbre from a source speaker to any unseen target speaker while preserving linguistic content. Growing application scenarios demand models with streaming inference capabilities. This has created a pressing need for models that are simultaneously fast, lightweight, and high-fidelity. However, existing streaming methods typically rely on either autoregressive (AR) or non-autoregressive (NAR) frameworks, which either require large parameter sizes to achieve strong performance or struggle to generalize to unseen speakers. In this study, we propose MeanVC, a lightweight and streaming zero-shot VC approach. MeanVC introduces a diffusion transformer with a chunk-wise autoregressive denoising strategy, combining the strengths of both AR and NAR paradigms for efficient streaming processing. By introducing mean flows, MeanVC regresses the average velocity field during training, enabling zero-shot VC with superior speech quality and speaker similarity in a single sampling step by directly mapping from the start to the endpoint of the flow trajectory. Additionally, we incorporate diffusion adversarial post-training to mitigate over-smoothing and further enhance speech quality. Experimental results demonstrate that MeanVC significantly outperforms existing zero-shot streaming VC systems, achieving superior conversion quality with higher efficiency and significantly fewer parameters.

Title: A Non-Uniform Quantization Framework for Time-Encoding Machines
Authors: Kaluguri Yashaswini, Anshu Arora, Satish Mulleti
Abstract: Time encoding machines (TEMs) provide an event-driven alternative to classical uniform sampling, enabling power-efficient representations without a global clock. While prior work analyzed uniform quantization (UQ) of firing intervals, we show that these intervals are inherently non-uniformly distributed, motivating the use of non-uniform quantization (NUQ). We derive the probability distribution of firing intervals for a class of bandlimited signals and design a power-law-based NUQ scheme tailored to this distribution. Simulations demonstrate that NUQ significantly outperforms UQ under the same bit budget. We also compare TEMs with non-uniform sampling (NUS), where both amplitudes and timings require quantization, and show that TEM--NUQ achieves lower error at half the transmission cost. These results highlight the advantages of distribution-aware quantization and establish TEM--NUQ as an efficient alternative to conventional UQ and NUS schemes.

Title: Weakly Supervised Segmentation and Classification of Alpha-Synuclein Aggregates in Brightfield Midbrain Images
Authors: Erwan Dereure, Robin Louiset, Laura Parkkinen, David A Menassa, David Holcman
Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with the accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates, forming Lewy bodies and neuritic shape used for pathology diagnostics. Automatic analysis of immunohistochemistry histopathological images with Deep Learning provides a promising tool for better understanding the spatial organization of these aggregates. In this study, we develop an automated image processing pipeline to segment and classify these aggregates in whole-slide images (WSIs) of midbrain tissue from PD and incidental Lewy Body Disease (iLBD) cases based on weakly supervised segmentation, robust to immunohistochemical labelling variability, with a ResNet50 classifier. Our approach allows to differentiate between major aggregate morphologies, including Lewy bodies and neurites with a balanced accuracy of $80\%$. This framework paves the way for large-scale characterization of the spatial distribution and heterogeneity of alpha-synuclein aggregates in brightfield immunohistochemical tissue, and for investigating their poorly understood relationships with surrounding cells such as microglia and astrocytes.

Title: Two-Dimensional Tomographic Reconstruction From Projections With Unknown Angles and Unknown Spatial Shifts
Authors: Shreyas Jayant Grampurohit, Satish Mulleti, Ajit Rajwade
Abstract: In parallel beam computed tomography (CT), an object is reconstructed from a series of projections taken at different angles. However, in some industrial and biomedical imaging applications, the projection geometry is unknown, completely or partially. In this paper, we present a technique for two-dimensional (2D) tomography in which both viewing angles and spatial shifts associated with the projections are unknown. There exists literature on 2D unknown view tomography (UVT), but most existing 2D UVT algorithms assume that the projections are centered; that is, there are no spatial shifts in the projections. To tackle these geometric ambiguities, we first modify an existing graph Laplacian-based algorithm for 2D UVT to incorporate spatial shifts, and then use it as the initialization for the proposed three-way alternating minimization algorithm that jointly estimates the 2D structure, its projection angles, and the corresponding shifts. We evaluate our method on noisy projections of ribosome images and demonstrate that it achieves superior reconstruction compared to the baseline that neglects shifts.

Title: Configuration-Constrained Tube MPC for Periodic Operation
Authors: Filippo Badalamenti, Jose A. Borja-Conde, Sampath Kumar Mulagaleti, Boris Houska, Alberto Bemporad, Mario Eduardo Villanueva
Abstract: Periodic operation often emerges as the economically optimal mode in industrial processes, particularly under varying economic or environmental conditions. This paper proposes a robust model predictive control (MPC) framework for uncertain systems modeled as polytopic linear differential inclusions (LDIs), where the dynamics evolve as convex combinations of finitely many affine control systems with additive disturbances. The robust control problem is reformulated as a convex optimization program by optimizing over configuration-constrained polytopic tubes and tracks a periodic trajectory that is optimal for a given economic criterion. Artificial variables embedded in the formulation ensure recursive feasibility and robust constraint satisfaction when the economic criterion is updated online, while guaranteeing convergence to the corresponding optimal periodic tube when the criterion remains constant. To improve computational efficiency, we introduce a quadratic over-approximation of the periodic cost under a Lipschitz continuity assumption, yielding a Quadratic Program (QP) formulation that preserves the above theoretical guarantees. The effectiveness and scalability of the approach are demonstrated on a benchmark example and a ball-plate system with eight states.

Title: Chirp Delay-Doppler Domain Modulation Based Joint Communication and Radar for Autonomous Vehicles
Authors: Zhuoran Li, Zhen Gao, Sheng Chen, Dusit Niyato, Zhaocheng Wang, George K. Karagiannidis
Abstract: This paper introduces a sensing-centric joint communication and millimeter-wave radar paradigm to facilitate collaboration among intelligent vehicles. We first propose a chirp waveform-based delay-Doppler quadrature amplitude modulation (DD-QAM) that modulates data across delay, Doppler, and amplitude dimensions. Building upon this modulation scheme, we derive its achievable rate to quantify the communication performance. We then introduce an extended Kalman filter-based scheme for four-dimensional (4D) parameter estimation in dynamic environments, enabling the active vehicles to accurately estimate orientation and tangential-velocity beyond traditional 4D radar systems. Furthermore, in terms of communication, we propose a dual-compensation-based demodulation and tracking scheme that allows the passive vehicles to effectively demodulate data without compromising their sensing functions. Simulation results underscore the feasibility and superior performance of our proposed methods, marking a significant advancement in the field of autonomous vehicles.

Title: Large Model Enabled Embodied Intelligence for 6G Integrated Perception, Communication, and Computation Network
Authors: Zhuoran Li, Zhen Gao, Xinhua Liu, Zheng Wang, Xiaotian Zhou, Lei Liu, Yongpeng Wu, Wei Feng, Yongming Huang
Abstract: The advent of sixth-generation (6G) places intelligence at the core of wireless architecture, fusing perception, communication, and computation into a single closed-loop. This paper argues that large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) can endow base stations with perception, reasoning, and acting capabilities, thus transforming them into intelligent base station agents (IBSAs). We first review the historical evolution of BSs from single-functional analog infrastructure to distributed, software-defined, and finally LAM-empowered IBSA, highlighting the accompanying changes in architecture, hardware platforms, and deployment. We then present an IBSA architecture that couples a perception-cognition-execution pipeline with cloud-edge-end collaboration and parameter-efficient adaptation. Subsequently,we study two representative scenarios: (i) cooperative vehicle-road perception for autonomous driving, and (ii) ubiquitous base station support for low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicle safety monitoring and response against unauthorized drones. On this basis, we analyze key enabling technologies spanning LAM design and training, efficient edge-cloud inference, multi-modal perception and actuation, as well as trustworthy security and governance. We further propose a holistic evaluation framework and benchmark considerations that jointly cover communication performance, perception accuracy, decision-making reliability, safety, and energy efficiency. Finally, we distill open challenges on benchmarks, continual adaptation, trustworthy decision-making, and standardization. Together, this work positions LAM-enabled IBSAs as a practical path toward integrated perception, communication, and computation native, safety-critical 6G systems.

Title: Semi-Blind Joint Channel and Symbol Estimation for Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Surfaces
Authors: Gilderlan Tavares de Araújo, André L. F. de Almeida, Buno Sokal, Gabor Fodor, Paulo R. B. Gomes
Abstract: The beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) is a recent architecture in which scattering elements are interconnected to enhance the degrees of freedom for wave control, yielding performance gains over traditional single-connected RISs. For BD-RIS, channel estimation - well-studied for conventional RIS - becomes more challenging due to the complex connections and a larger number of coefficients. Prior works rely on pilot-assisted estimation followed by data decoding. This paper introduces a semi-blind tensor-based approach for joint channel and symbol estimation that eliminates the need for training sequences by leveraging data symbols directly. A practical scenario with time-varying user terminal-RIS channels under mobility is considered. By reformulating the received signal from a tensor decomposition perspective, we develop two semi-blind receivers: a two-stage method transforming the fourth-order PARATUCK model into a third-order PARAFAC model, and a single-stage iterative process based on fourth-order TUCKER decomposition. Identifiability conditions for reliable joint recovery are derived, and numerical results demonstrate the performance advantages and trade-offs of the proposed schemes over existing solutions.

Title: Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for Nonlinear Matrix Decompositions
Authors: Atharva Awari, Nicolas Gillis, Arnaud Vandaele
Abstract: We present an algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for solving nonlinear matrix decompositions (NMD). Given an input matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ and a factorization rank $r \ll \min(m, n)$, NMD seeks matrices $W \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times r}$ and $H \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times n}$ such that $X \approx f(WH)$, where $f$ is an element-wise nonlinear function. We evaluate our method on several representative nonlinear models: the rectified linear unit activation $f(x) = \max(0, x)$, suitable for nonnegative sparse data approximation, the component-wise square $f(x) = x^2$, applicable to probabilistic circuit representation, and the MinMax transform $f(x) = \min(b, \max(a, x))$, relevant for recommender systems. The proposed framework flexibly supports diverse loss functions, including least squares, $\ell_1$ norm, and the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and can be readily extended to other nonlinearities and metrics. We illustrate the applicability, efficiency, and adaptability of the approach on real-world datasets, highlighting its potential for a broad range of applications.

Title: Any-Time Regret-Guaranteed Algorithm for Control of Linear Quadratic Systems
Authors: Jafar Abbaszadeh Chekan, Cedric Langbort
Abstract: We propose a computationally efficient algorithm that achieves anytime regret of order $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{t})$, with explicit dependence on the system dimensions and on the solution of the Discrete Algebraic Riccati Equation (DARE). Our approach uses an appropriately tuned regularization and a sufficiently accurate initial estimate to construct confidence ellipsoids for control design. A carefully designed input-perturbation mechanism is incorporated to ensure anytime performance. We develop two variants of the algorithm. The first enforces strong sequential stability, requiring each policy to be stabilizing and successive policies to remain close. This sequential condition helps prevent state explosion at policy update times; however, it results in a suboptimal regret scaling with respect to the DARE solution. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce a second class of algorithms that removes this requirement and instead requires only that each generated policy be stabilizing. Closed-loop stability is then preserved through a dwell-time inspired policy-update rule. This class of algorithms also addresses key shortcomings of most existing approaches which lack explicit high-probability bounds on the state trajectory expressed in system-theoretic terms. Our analysis shows that partially relaxing the sequential-stability requirement yields optimal regret. Finally, our method eliminates the need for any \emph{a priori} bound on the norm of the DARE solution, an assumption required by all existing computationally efficient OFU based algorithms.

Title: Networked Communication for Mean-Field Games with Function Approximation and Empirical Mean-Field Estimation
Authors: Patrick Benjamin, Alessandro Abate
Abstract: Recent algorithms allow decentralised agents, possibly connected via a communication network, to learn equilibria in mean-field games from a non-episodic run of the empirical system. However, these algorithms are for tabular settings: this computationally limits the size of agents' observation space, meaning the algorithms cannot handle anything but small state spaces, nor generalise beyond policies depending only on the agent's local state to so-called 'population-dependent' policies. We address this limitation by introducing function approximation to the existing setting, drawing on the Munchausen Online Mirror Descent method that has previously been employed only in finite-horizon, episodic, centralised settings. While this permits us to include the mean field in the observation for players' policies, it is unrealistic to assume decentralised agents have access to this global information: we therefore also provide new algorithms allowing agents to locally estimate the global empirical distribution, and to improve this estimate via inter-agent communication. We prove theoretically that exchanging policy information helps networked agents outperform both independent and even centralised agents in function-approximation settings. Our experiments demonstrate this happening empirically, and show that the communication network allows decentralised agents to estimate the mean field for population-dependent policies.

Title: Improving the Accuracy of DC Optimal Power Flow Formulations via Parameter Optimization
Authors: Babak Taheri, Daniel K. Molzahn
Abstract: DC Optimal Power Flow (DC-OPF) problems optimize the generators' active power setpoints while satisfying constraints based on the DC power flow linearization. The computational tractability advantages of DC-OPF problems come at the expense of inaccuracies relative to AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problems that accurately model the nonlinear steady-state behavior of power grids. This paper proposes an algorithm that significantly improves the accuracy of the generators' active power setpoints from DC-OPF problems with respect to the corresponding AC-OPF problems over a specified range of operating conditions. Using sensitivity information in a machine learning-inspired methodology, this algorithm tunes coefficient and bias parameters in the DC power flow approximation to improve the accuracy of the resulting DC-OPF solutions. Employing the Truncated Newton Conjugate-Gradient (TNC) method, a Quasi-Newton optimization technique, this parameter tuning occurs during an offline training phase, with the resulting parameters then used in online computations. Numerical results underscore the algorithm's efficacy with accuracy improvements in squared two-norm and $\infty$-norm losses of up to $90\%$ and $79\%$, respectively, relative to traditional DC-OPF formulations.

Title: GUIDEd Agents: Enhancing Navigation Policies through Task-Specific Uncertainty Abstraction in Localization-Limited Environments
Authors: Gokul Puthumanaillam, Paulo Padrao, Jose Fuentes, Leonardo Bobadilla, Melkior Ornik
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles performing navigation tasks in complex environments face significant challenges due to uncertainty in state estimation. In many scenarios, such as stealth operations or resource-constrained settings, accessing high-precision localization comes at a significant cost, forcing robots to rely primarily on less precise state estimates. Our key observation is that different tasks require varying levels of precision in different regions: a robot navigating a crowded space might need precise localization near obstacles but can operate effectively with less precision elsewhere. In this paper, we present a planning method for integrating task-specific uncertainty requirements directly into navigation policies. We introduce Task-Specific Uncertainty Maps (TSUMs), which abstract the acceptable levels of state estimation uncertainty across different regions. TSUMs align task requirements and environmental features using a shared representation space, generated via a domain-adapted encoder. Using TSUMs, we propose Generalized Uncertainty Integration for Decision-Making and Execution (GUIDE), a policy conditioning framework that incorporates these uncertainty requirements into robot decision-making. We find that TSUMs provide an effective way to abstract task-specific uncertainty requirements, and conditioning policies on TSUMs enables the robot to reason about the context-dependent value of certainty and adapt its behavior accordingly. We show how integrating GUIDE into reinforcement learning frameworks allows the agent to learn navigation policies that effectively balance task completion and uncertainty management without explicit reward engineering. We evaluate GUIDE on various real-world robotic navigation tasks and find that it demonstrates significant improvement in task completion rates compared to baseline methods that do not explicitly consider task-specific uncertainty.

Title: PowerMamba: A Deep State Space Model and Comprehensive Benchmark for Time Series Prediction in Electric Power Systems
Authors: Ali Menati, Fatemeh Doudi, Dileep Kalathil, Le Xie
Abstract: The electricity sector is undergoing substantial transformations due to the rising electrification of demand, enhanced integration of renewable energy resources, and the emergence of new technologies. These changes are rendering the electric grid more volatile and unpredictable, making it difficult to maintain reliable operations. In order to address these issues, advanced time series prediction models are needed for closing the gap between the forecasted and actual grid outcomes. In this paper, we introduce a multivariate time series prediction model that combines traditional state space models with deep learning methods to simultaneously capture and predict the underlying dynamics of multiple time series. Additionally, we design a time series processing module that incorporates high-resolution external forecasts into sequence-to-sequence prediction models, achieving this with negligible increases in size and no loss of accuracy. We also release an extended dataset spanning five years of load, electricity price, ancillary service price, and renewable generation. To complement this dataset, we provide an open-access toolbox that includes our proposed model, the dataset itself, and several state-of-the-art prediction models, thereby creating a unified framework for benchmarking advanced machine learning approaches. Our findings indicate that the proposed model outperforms existing models across various prediction tasks, improving state-of-the-art prediction error by an average of 7% and decreasing model parameters by 43%.

Title: A Riemannian Optimization Perspective of the Gauss-Newton Method for Feedforward Neural Networks
Authors: Semih Cayci
Abstract: In this work, we establish non-asymptotic convergence bounds for the Gauss-Newton method in training neural networks with smooth activations. In the underparameterized regime, the Gauss-Newton gradient flow in parameter space induces a Riemannian gradient flow on a low-dimensional embedded submanifold of the function space. Using tools from Riemannian optimization, we establish geodesic Polyak-Lojasiewicz and Lipschitz-smoothness conditions for the loss under appropriately chosen output scaling, yielding geometric convergence to the optimal in-class predictor at an explicit rate independent of the conditioning of the Gram matrix. In the overparameterized regime, we propose adaptive, curvature-aware regularization schedules that ensure fast geometric convergence to a global optimum at a rate independent of the minimum eigenvalue of the neural tangent kernel and, locally, of the modulus of strong convexity of the loss. These results demonstrate that Gauss-Newton achieves accelerated convergence rates in settings where first-order methods exhibit slow convergence due to ill-conditioned kernel matrices and loss landscapes.

Title: Stable EEG Source Estimation for Standardized Kalman Filter using Change Rate Tracking
Authors: Joonas Lahtinen
Abstract: This article focuses on the measurement and evolution modeling of Standardized Kalman filtering for brain activity estimation using non-invasive electroencephalography data. Here, we propose new parameter tuning and a model that uses the rate of change in the brain activity distribution to improve the stability of otherwise accurate estimates. Namely, we propose a backward-differentiation-based measurement model for the change rate, which notably improves the filtering-parametrization-stability of the tracking. Simulated data and data from a real subject were used in experiments.

Title: JITServe: SLO-aware LLM Serving with Imprecise Request Information
Authors: Wei Zhang, Zhiyu Wu, Yi Mu, Rui Ning, Banruo Liu, Nikhil Sarda, Myungjin Lee, Fan Lai
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into applications ranging from interactive chatbots to multi-agent systems has introduced a wide spectrum of service-level objectives (SLOs) for responsiveness. These include latency-sensitive requests emphasizing per-token latency in streaming chat, deadline-sensitive requests requiring rapid full responses to trigger external tools, and compound requests with evolving dependencies across multiple LLM calls. Despite-or perhaps, because of-this workload diversity and unpredictable request information (e.g., response lengths and dependencies), existing request schedulers have focused on aggregate performance, unable to ensure application-level SLO needs. This paper presents JITServe, the first SLO-aware LLM serving system designed to maximize service goodput (e.g., the number of tokens meeting request SLOs) across diverse workloads. JITServe novelly schedules requests using imprecise request information and gradually relaxes this conservatism by refining request information estimates as generation progresses. It applies a grouped margin goodput maximization algorithm to allocate just enough serving bandwidth to satisfy each request's SLO just-in-time (JIT), maximizing residual capacity for others, while deciding the composition of requests in a batch to maximize efficiency and goodput with provable guarantees. Our evaluation across diverse realistic workloads, including chat, deep research, and agentic pipelines, shows that JITServe improves service goodput by 1.4x-6.3x, alternatively achieving 28.5%-83.2% resource savings, compared to state-of-the-art designs.

Title: Personalized and Resilient Distributed Learning Through Opinion Dynamics
Authors: Luca Ballotta, Nicola Bastianello, Riccardo M. G. Ferrari, Karl H. Johansson
Abstract: In this paper, we address two practical challenges of distributed learning in multi-agent network systems, namely personalization and resilience. Personalization is the need of heterogeneous agents to learn local models tailored to their own data and tasks, while still generalizing well; on the other hand, the learning process must be resilient to cyberattacks or anomalous training data to avoid disruption. Motivated by a conceptual affinity between these two requirements, we devise a distributed learning algorithm that combines distributed gradient descent and the Friedkin-Johnsen model of opinion dynamics to fulfill both of them. We quantify its convergence speed and the neighborhood that contains the final learned models, which can be easily controlled by tuning the algorithm parameters to enforce a more personalized/resilient behavior. We numerically showcase the effectiveness of our algorithm on synthetic and real-world distributed learning tasks, where it achieves high global accuracy both for personalized models and with malicious agents compared to standard strategies.

Title: Fast Compressed-Domain N-Point Discrete Fourier Transform: The "Twiddless" FFT Algorithm
Authors: Saulo Queiroz
Abstract: In this work, we present the \emph{twiddless fast Fourier transform (TFFT)}, a novel algorithm for computing the $N$-point discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The TFFT's divide strategy builds on recent results that decimate an $N$-point signal (by a factor of $p$) into an $N/p$-point compressed signal whose DFT readily yields $N/p$ coefficients of the original signal. However, existing compression-domain DFT analyses have been limited to computing only the even-indexed DFT coefficients. With TFFT, we overcome this limitation by efficiently computing both \emph{even- and odd-indexed} DFT coefficients in the compressed domain with $O(N \log N)$ complexity. TFFT introduces a new recursive decomposition of the DFT problem, wherein $N/2^i$ coefficients of the original input are computed at recursion level $i$, with no need for twiddle factor multiplications or butterfly structures. Additionally, TFFT generalizes the input length to $N = c \cdot 2^k$ (for $k \geq 0$ and non-power-of-two $c > 0$), reducing the need for zero-padding and potentially improving efficiency and stability over classical FFTs. We believe TFFT represents a \emph{novel paradigm} for DFT computation, opening new directions for research in optimized implementations, hardware design, parallel computation, and sparse transforms.

Title: Structural Integrality in Task Assignment and Path Finding via Total Unimodularity of Petri Net Models
Authors: Ioana Hustiu, Roozbeh Abolpour, Marius Kloetzer, Cristian Mahulea
Abstract: Task Assignment and Path Finding (TAPF) concerns computing collision-free motions for multiple robots while jointly selecting goal locations. In this paper, safety is enforced by requiring unit-capacity traversal between successive intermediate markings, yielding coordination strategies that are valid independently of any specific time interpretation. Existing optimization-based approaches typically rely on time-expanded network-flow models, which result in large mixed-integer programs and limited scalability. We instead develop a Petri net (PN)-based optimization framework that exploits structural properties of the motion model to improve computational efficiency without explicit time expansion. When robot motion is modeled by strongly connected state-machine PNs, we show that, once the congestion level (equivalently, the synchronization depth) is fixed to an integer value, the resulting motion-planning constraint matrix is totally unimodular. Consequently, the corresponding LP relaxation admits integral optimal solutions for the motion variables. When the estimated congestion exceeds one, we introduce a synchronization-on-demand mechanism based on intermediate markings; for a fixed number of synchronization stages, the associated constraint matrices remain totally unimodular, thereby preserving integrality of the motion variables. Finally, we extend TAPF to Boolean specifications over regions of interest and propose a two-stage LP/mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) scheme in which integrality is confined to task-selection variables. Simulations on large benchmarks demonstrate substantial scalability improvements over time-expanded optimization baselines.

Title: TAG-WM: Tamper-Aware Generative Image Watermarking via Diffusion Inversion Sensitivity
Authors: Yuzhuo Chen, Zehua Ma, Han Fang, Weiming Zhang, Nenghai Yu
Abstract: AI-generated content (AIGC) enables efficient visual creation but raises copyright and authenticity risks. As a common technique for integrity verification and source tracing, digital image watermarking is regarded as a potential solution to above issues. However, the widespread adoption and advancing capabilities of generative image editing tools have amplified malicious tampering risks, while simultaneously posing new challenges to passive tampering detection and watermark robustness. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Tamper-Aware Generative image WaterMarking method named TAG-WM. The proposed method comprises four key modules: a dual-mark joint sampling (DMJS) algorithm for embedding copyright and localization watermarks into the latent space while preserving generative quality, the watermark latent reconstruction (WLR) utilizing reversed DMJS, a dense variation region detector (DVRD) leveraging diffusion inversion sensitivity to identify tampered areas via statistical deviation analysis, and the tamper-aware decoding (TAD) guided by localization results. The experimental results demonstrate that TAG-WM achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tampering robustness and localization capability even under distortion, while preserving lossless generation quality and maintaining a watermark capacity of 256 bits.

Title: Wi-Fi: Twenty-Five Years and Counting
Authors: Giovanni Geraci, Francesca Meneghello, Francesc Wilhelmi, David Lopez-Perez, Iñaki Val, Lorenzo Galati Giordano, Carlos Cordeiro, Monisha Ghosh, Edward Knightly, Boris Bellalta
Abstract: Today, Wi-Fi is over 25 years old. Yet, despite sharing the same branding name, today's Wi-Fi boasts entirely new capabilities that were not even on the roadmap 25 years ago. This article aims to provide a holistic and comprehensive technical and historical tutorial on Wi-Fi, beginning with IEEE 802.11b (Wi-Fi 1) and looking forward to IEEE 802.11bn (Wi-Fi 8). This is the first tutorial article to span these eight generations. Rather than a generation-by-generation exposition, we describe the key mechanisms that have advanced Wi-Fi. We begin by discussing spectrum allocation and coexistence, and detailing the IEEE 802.11 standardization cycle. Second, we provide an overview of the physical layer and describe key elements that have enabled data rates to increase by over 1,000x. Third, we describe how Wi-Fi Medium Access Control has been enhanced from the original Distributed Coordination Function to now include capabilities spanning from frame aggregation to wideband spectrum access. Fourth, we describe how Wi-Fi 5 first broke the one-user-at-a-time paradigm and introduced multi-user access. Fifth, given the increasing use of mobile, battery-powered devices, we describe Wi-Fi's energy-saving mechanisms over the generations. Sixth, we discuss how Wi-Fi was enhanced to seamlessly aggregate spectrum across 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands to improve throughput, reliability, and latency. Finally, we describe how Wi-Fi enables nearby Access Points to coordinate in order to improve performance and efficiency. In the Appendix, we further discuss Wi-Fi developments beyond 802.11bn, including integrated mmWave operations, sensing, security and privacy extensions, and the adoption of AI/ML.

Title: From Binary to Semantic: Utilizing Large-Scale Binary Occupancy Data for 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction
Authors: Chihiro Noguchi, Takaki Yamamoto
Abstract: Accurate perception of the surrounding environment is essential for safe autonomous driving. 3D occupancy prediction, which estimates detailed 3D structures of roads, buildings, and other objects, is particularly important for vision-centric autonomous driving systems that do not rely on LiDAR sensors. However, in 3D semantic occupancy prediction -- where each voxel is assigned a semantic label -- annotated LiDAR point clouds are required, making data acquisition costly. In contrast, large-scale binary occupancy data, which only indicate occupied or free space without semantic labels, can be collected at a lower cost. Despite their availability, the potential of leveraging such data remains unexplored. In this study, we investigate the utilization of large-scale binary occupancy data from two perspectives: (1) pre-training and (2) learning-based auto-labeling. We propose a novel binary occupancy-based framework that decomposes the prediction process into binary and semantic occupancy modules, enabling effective use of binary occupancy data. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods in both pre-training and auto-labeling tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing 3D semantic occupancy prediction.

Title: Joint parameter estimation and multidimensional reconciliation for continuous-variable quantum key distribution
Authors: Jisheng Dai, Xue-Qin Jiang, Peng Huang, Tao Wang, Guihua Zeng
Abstract: Accurate quantum channel parameter estimation is essential for effective information reconciliation in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD). However, conventional maximum likelihood (ML) estimators rely on a large amount of discarded data (or pilot symbols), leading to a significant loss in symbol efficiency. Moreover, the separation between the estimation and reconciliation phases can introduce error propagation. In this paper, we propose a novel joint message-passing scheme that unifies channel parameter estimation and information reconciliation within a Bayesian framework. By leveraging the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, the proposed method simultaneously estimates unknown parameters during decoding, eliminating the need for separate ML estimation. Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid multidimensional rotation scheme that removes the requirement for norm feedback, significantly reducing classical channel overhead. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to unify multidimensional reconciliation and channel parameter estimation in CV-QKD, providing a practical solution for high-efficiency reconciliation with minimal pilots.

Title: On Zero-sum Game Representation for Replicator Dynamics
Authors: Haoyu Yin, Xudong Chen, Bruno Sinopoli
Abstract: Replicator dynamics have been widely used in evolutionary game theory to model how strategy frequencies evolve over time in large populations. The so-called payoff matrix encodes the pairwise fitness that each strategy obtains when interacting with every other strategy, and it solely determines the replicator dynamics. If the payoff matrix is unknown, we show in this paper that it cannot be inferred from observed strategy frequencies alone -- distinct payoff matrices can induce the same replicator dynamics. We thus look for a canonical representative of the payoff matrix in the equivalence class. The main result of the paper is to show that for every polynomial replicator dynamics (i.e., the vector field is a polynomial), there always exists a skew-symmetric, polynomial payoff matrix that can induce the given dynamics.

Title: Machine Unlearning in Speech Emotion Recognition via Forget Set Alone
Authors: Zhao Ren, Rathi Adarshi Rammohan, Kevin Scheck, Tanja Schultz
Abstract: Speech emotion recognition aims to identify emotional states from speech signals and has been widely applied in human-computer interaction, education, healthcare, and many other fields. However, since speech data contain rich sensitive information, partial data can be required to be deleted by speakers due to privacy concerns. Current machine unlearning approaches largely depend on data beyond the samples to be forgotten. However, this reliance poses challenges when data redistribution is restricted and demands substantial computational resources in the context of big data. We propose a novel adversarial-attack-based approach that fine-tunes a pre-trained speech emotion recognition model using only the data to be forgotten. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively remove the knowledge of the data to be forgotten from the model, while preserving high model performance on the test set for emotion recognition.

Title: Nonasymptotic Convergence Rates for Plug-and-Play Methods With MMSE Denoisers
Authors: Henry Pritchard, Rahul Parhi
Abstract: It is known that the minimum-mean-squared-error (MMSE) denoiser under Gaussian noise can be written as a proximal operator, which suffices for asymptotic convergence of plug-and-play (PnP) methods but does not reveal the structure of the induced regularizer or give convergence rates. We show that the MMSE denoiser corresponds to a regularizer that can be written explicitly as an upper Moreau envelope of the negative log-marginal density, which in turn implies that the regularizer is 1-weakly convex. Using this property, we derive (to the best of our knowledge) the first sublinear convergence guarantee for PnP proximal gradient descent with an MMSE denoiser. We validate the theory with a one-dimensional synthetic study that recovers the implicit regularizer. We also validate the theory with imaging experiments (deblurring and computed tomography), which exhibit the predicted sublinear behavior.

Title: STAIR: Stability criterion for Time-windowed Assignment and Internal adversarial influence in Routing and decision-making
Authors: Roee M. Francos, Daniel Garces, Orhan Eren Akgün, Stephanie Gil
Abstract: A major limitation of existing routing algorithms for multi-agent systems is that they are designed without considering the potential presence of adversarial agents in the decision-making loop, which could lead to severe performance degradation in real-life applications where adversarial agents may be present. We study autonomous pickup-and-delivery routing problems in which adversarial agents launch coordinated denial-of-service attacks by spoofing their locations. This deception causes the central scheduler to assign pickup requests to adversarial agents instead of cooperative agents. Adversarial agents then choose not to service the requests with the goal of disrupting the operation of the system, leading to delays, cancellations, and potential instability in the routing policy. Policy stability in routing problems is typically defined as the cost of the policy being uniformly bounded over time, and it has been studied through two different lenses: queuing theory and reinforcement learning (RL), which are not well suited for routing with adversaries. In this paper, we propose a new stability criterion, STAIR, which is easier to analyze than queuing-theory-based stability in adversarial settings. Furthermore, STAIR does not depend on a chosen discount factor as is the case in discounted RL stability. STAIR directly links stability to desired operational metrics, like a finite number of rejected requests. This characterization is particularly useful in adversarial settings as it provides a metric for monitoring the effect of adversaries in the operation of the system. Furthermore, we demonstrate STAIR's practical relevance through simulations on real-world San Francisco mobility-on-demand data. We also identify a phenomenon of degenerate stability that arises in the adversarial routing problem, and we introduce time-window constraints in the decision-making algorithm to mitigate it.

Title: An Architecture for Remote Container Builds and Artifact Delivery Using a Controller-Light Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline
Authors: Kawshik Kumar Paul, Sawmik Kumar Paul
Abstract: Resource-intensive builds are often executed directly on the controller by conventional Jenkins installations, which can lower reliability and overload system resources. Jenkins functions as a containerized controller with persistent volumes in the controller-light CI/CD framework presented in this paper, delegating difficult build and packaging tasks to a remote Docker host. The controller container maintains secure SSH connections to remote compute nodes while focusing solely on orchestration and reporting. Atomic deployments with time-stamped backups, containerized build environments, immutable artifact packaging, and automated notifications are all included in the system. Faster build throughput, reduced CPU and RAM consumption on the controller, and reduced artifact delivery latency are all revealed by experimental evaluation. For small and medium-sized DevOps businesses looking for scalable automation without adding orchestration complexity, this method offers a repeatable, low-maintenance solution.

Title: Enhancing Diffusion Model Guidance through Calibration and Regularization
Authors: Seyed Alireza Javid, Amirhossein Bagheri, Nuria González-Prelcic
Abstract: Classifier-guided diffusion models have emerged as a powerful approach for conditional image generation, but they suffer from overconfident predictions during early denoising steps, causing the guidance gradient to vanish. This paper introduces two complementary contributions to address this issue. First, we propose a differentiable calibration objective based on the Smooth Expected Calibration Error (Smooth ECE), which improves classifier calibration with minimal fine-tuning and yields measurable improvements in Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Second, we develop enhanced sampling guidance methods that operate on off-the-shelf classifiers without requiring retraining. These include tilted sampling with batch-level reweighting, adaptive entropy-regularized sampling to preserve diversity, and a novel f-divergence-based sampling strategy that strengthens class-consistent guidance while maintaining mode coverage. Experiments on ImageNet 128x128 demonstrate that our divergence-regularized guidance achieves an FID of 2.13 using a ResNet-101 classifier, improving upon existing classifier-guided diffusion methods while requiring no diffusion model retraining. The results show that principled calibration and divergence-aware sampling provide practical and effective improvements for classifier-guided diffusion.

Title: MTTR-A: Measuring Cognitive Recovery Latency in Multi-Agent Systems
Authors: Barak Or
Abstract: Reliability in multi-agent systems (MAS) built on large language models is increasingly limited by cognitive failures rather than infrastructure faults. Existing observability tools describe failures but do not quantify how quickly distributed reasoning recovers once coherence is lost. We introduce MTTR-A (Mean Time-to-Recovery for Agentic Systems), a runtime reliability metric that measures cognitive recovery latency in MAS. MTTR-A adapts classical dependability theory to agentic orchestration, capturing the time required to detect reasoning drift and restore coherent operation. We further define complementary metrics, including MTBF and a normalized recovery ratio (NRR), and establish theoretical bounds linking recovery latency to long-run cognitive uptime. Using a LangGraph-based benchmark with simulated drift and reflex recovery, we empirically demonstrate measurable recovery behavior across multiple reflex strategies. This work establishes a quantitative foundation for runtime cognitive dependability in distributed agentic systems.

Title: SSAS: Cross-subject EEG-based Emotion Recognition through Source Selection with Adversarial Strategy
Authors: Yici Liu, Qi Wei Oung, Hoi Leong Lee
Abstract: Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals have long been applied in the field of affective brain-computer interfaces (aBCIs). Cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition has demonstrated significant potential in practical applications due to its suitability across diverse people. However, most studies on cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition neglect the presence of inter-individual variability and negative transfer phenomena during model training. To address this issue, a cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition through source selection with adversarial strategy is introduced in this paper. The proposed method comprises two modules: the source selection network (SS) and the adversarial strategies network (AS). The SS uses domain labels to reverse-engineer the training process of domain adaptation. Its key idea is to disrupt class separability and magnify inter-domain differences, thereby raising the classification difficulty and forcing the model to learn domain-invariant yet emotion-relevant representations. The AS gets the source domain selection results and the pretrained domain discriminators from SS. The pretrained domain discriminators compute a novel loss aimed at enhancing the performance of domain classification during adversarial training, ensuring the balance of adversarial strategies. This paper provides theoretical insights into the proposed method and achieves outstanding performance on two EEG-based emotion datasets, SEED and SEED-IV. The code can be found at this https URL.

Title: Fine-Tuning of Neural Network Approximate MPC without Retraining via Bayesian Optimization
Authors: Henrik Hose, Paul Brunzema, Alexander von Rohr, Alexander Gräfe, Angela P. Schoellig, Sebastian Trimpe
Abstract: Approximate model-predictive control (AMPC) aims to imitate an MPC's behavior with a neural network, removing the need to solve an expensive optimization problem at runtime. However, during deployment, the parameters of the underlying MPC must usually be fine-tuned. This often renders AMPC impractical as it requires repeatedly generating a new dataset and retraining the neural network. Recent work addresses this problem by adapting AMPC without retraining using approximated sensitivities of the MPC's optimization problem. Currently, this adaption must be done by hand, which is labor-intensive and can be unintuitive for high-dimensional systems. To solve this issue, we propose using Bayesian optimization to tune the parameters of AMPC policies based on experimental data. By combining model-based control with direct and local learning, our approach achieves superior performance to nominal AMPC on hardware, with minimal experimentation. This allows automatic and data-efficient adaptation of AMPC to new system instances and fine-tuning to cost functions that are difficult to directly implement in MPC. We demonstrate the proposed method in hardware experiments for the swing-up maneuver on an inverted cartpole and yaw control of an under-actuated balancing unicycle robot, a challenging control problem.

Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning Optimization for Uncertain Nonlinear Systems via Event-Triggered Robust Adaptive Dynamic Programming
Authors: Ningwei Bai, Chi Pui Chan, Qichen Yin, Tengyang Gong, Yunda Yan, Zezhi Tang
Abstract: This work proposes a unified control architecture that couples a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-driven controller with a disturbance-rejection Extended State Observer (ESO), complemented by an Event-Triggered Mechanism (ETM) to limit unnecessary computations. The ESO is utilized to estimate the system states and the lumped disturbance in real time, forming the foundation for effective disturbance compensation. To obtain near-optimal behavior without an accurate system description, a value-iteration-based Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP) method is adopted for policy approximation. The inclusion of the ETM ensures that parameter updates of the learning module are executed only when the state deviation surpasses a predefined bound, thereby preventing excessive learning activity and substantially reducing computational load. A Lyapunov-oriented analysis is used to characterize the stability properties of the resulting closed-loop system. Numerical experiments further confirm that the developed approach maintains strong control performance and disturbance tolerance, while achieving a significant reduction in sampling and processing effort compared with standard time-triggered ADP schemes.
