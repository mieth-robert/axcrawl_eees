Title: Multispectral to Hyperspectral using Pretrained Foundational model
Authors: Ruben Gonzalez, Conrad M Albrecht, Nassim Ait Ali Braham, Devyani Lambhate, Joao Lucas de Sousa Almeida, Paolo Fraccaro, Benedikt Blumenstiel, Thomas Brunschwiler, Ranjini Bangalore
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging provides detailed spectral information, offering significant potential for monitoring greenhouse gases like CH4 and NO2. However, its application is constrained by limited spatial coverage and infrequent revisit times. In contrast, multispectral imaging delivers broader spatial and temporal coverage but lacks the spectral granularity required for precise GHG detection. To address these challenges, this study proposes Spectral and Spatial-Spectral transformer models that reconstruct hyperspectral data from multispectral inputs. The models in this paper are pretrained on EnMAP and EMIT datasets and fine-tuned on spatio-temporally aligned (Sentinel-2, EnMAP) and (HLS-S30, EMIT) image pairs respectively. Our model has the potential to enhance atmospheric monitoring by combining the strengths of hyperspectral and multispectral imaging systems.

Title: SPU-IMR: Self-supervised Arbitrary-scale Point Cloud Upsampling via Iterative Mask-recovery Network
Authors: Ziming Nie, Qiao Wu, Chenlei Lv, Siwen Quan, Zhaoshuai Qi, Muze Wang, Jiaqi Yang
Abstract: Point cloud upsampling aims to generate dense and uniformly distributed point sets from sparse point clouds. Existing point cloud upsampling methods typically approach the task as an interpolation problem. They achieve upsampling by performing local interpolation between point clouds or in the feature space, then regressing the interpolated points to appropriate positions. By contrast, our proposed method treats point cloud upsampling as a global shape completion problem. Specifically, our method first divides the point cloud into multiple patches. Then, a masking operation is applied to remove some patches, leaving visible point cloud patches. Finally, our custom-designed neural network iterative completes the missing sections of the point cloud through the visible parts. During testing, by selecting different mask sequences, we can restore various complete patches. A sufficiently dense upsampled point cloud can be obtained by merging all the completed patches. We demonstrate the superior performance of our method through both quantitative and qualitative experiments, showing overall superiority against both existing self-supervised and supervised methods.

Title: ILACS-LGOT: A Multi-Layer Contrast Enhancement Approach for Palm-Vein Images
Authors: Kaveen Perera, Fouad Khelifi, Ammar Belatreche
Abstract: This article presents an extended author's version based on our previous work, where we introduced the Multiple Overlapping Tiles (MOT) method for palm vein image enhancement. To better reflect the specific operations involved, we rename MOT to ILACS-LGOT (Intensity-Limited Adaptive Contrast Stretching with Layered Gaussian-weighted Overlapping Tiles). This revised terminology more accurately represents the method's approach to contrast enhancement and blocky effect mitigation. Additionally, this article provides a more detailed analysis, including expanded evaluations, graphical representations, and sample-based comparisons, demonstrating the effectiveness of ILACS-LGOT over existing methods.

Title: GONet: A Generalizable Deep Learning Model for Glaucoma Detection
Authors: Or Abramovich, Hadas Pizem, Jonathan Fhima, Eran Berkowitz, Ben Gofrit, Meishar Meisel, Meital Baskin, Jan Van Eijgen, Ingeborg Stalmans, Eytan Z. Blumenthal, Joachim A. Behar
Abstract: Glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) is a prevalent ocular disease that can lead to irreversible vision loss if not detected early and treated. The traditional diagnostic approach for GON involves a set of ophthalmic examinations, which are time-consuming and require a visit to an ophthalmologist. Recent deep learning models for automating GON detection from digital fundus images (DFI) have shown promise but often suffer from limited generalizability across different ethnicities, disease groups and examination settings. To address these limitations, we introduce GONet, a robust deep learning model developed using seven independent datasets, including over 119,000 DFIs with gold-standard annotations and from patients of diverse geographic backgrounds. GONet consists of a DINOv2 pre-trained self-supervised vision transformers fine-tuned using a multisource domain strategy. GONet demonstrated high out-of-distribution generalizability, with an AUC of 0.85-0.99 in target domains. GONet performance was similar or superior to state-of-the-art works and was significantly superior to the cup-to-disc ratio, by up to 21.6%. GONet is available at [URL provided on publication]. We also contribute a new dataset consisting of 768 DFI with GON labels as open access.

Title: Battery State of Health Estimation and Incremental Capacity Analysis for Charging with General Current Profiles Using Neural Networks
Authors: Qinan Zhou, Gabrielle Vuylsteke, R. Dyche Anderson, Jing Sun
Abstract: Incremental capacity analysis (ICA) and differential voltage analysis (DVA) conventionally require constant-current conditions for battery degradation monitoring, which restricts their applicability in real-world scenarios. This paper presents a unified approach to enable ICA/DVA-based degradation monitoring under general charging current profiles, which has not been addressed previously in the literature. First, a novel concept of virtual incremental capacity (IC) and different voltage (DV) is proposed. Second, two related convolutional neural networks (CNNs), called U-Net and Conv-Net, are proposed to construct virtual IC/DV curves and estimate the state of health (SOH) from general charging profiles across any state-of-charge (SOC) ranges that satisfy some constraints. Finally, two CNNs, called Mobile U-Net and Mobile-Net, are proposed to replace the U-Net and Conv-Net, respectively, for onboard implementations. They significantly reduce the computation and memory requirements, while retaining performance in virtual IC/DV curve construction and SOH estimation. Tested on an extensive experimental dataset of battery modules with various fast-charging protocols and SOC ranges, the proposed U-Net and Mobile U-Net construct accurate virtual IC/DV curves which enable the extraction of valuable degradation features. The proposed Conv-Net and Mobile-Net provide module-level SOH estimates with root-mean-square error (RMSE) of less than 0.5%.

Title: Electromagnetically Reconfigurable Fluid Antenna System for Wireless Communications: Design, Modeling, Algorithm, Fabrication, and Experiment
Authors: Ruiqi Wang, Pinjun Zheng, Vijith Varma Kotte, Sakandar Rauf, Yiming Yang, Muhammad Mahboob Ur Rahman, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Atif Shamim
Abstract: This paper presents the concept, design, channel modeling, beamforming algorithm, prototype fabrication, and experimental measurement of an electromagnetically reconfigurable fluid antenna system (ER-FAS), in which each FAS array element features electromagnetic (EM) reconfigurability. Unlike most existing FAS works that investigate spatial reconfigurability, the proposed ER-FAS enables direct control over the EM characteristics of each element, allowing for dynamic radiation pattern reconfigurability. Specifically, a novel ER-FAS architecture leveraging software-controlled fluidics is proposed, and corresponding wireless channel models are established. A low-complexity greedy beamforming algorithm is developed to jointly optimize the analog phase shift and the radiation state of each array element. The accuracy of the ER-FAS channel model and the effectiveness of the beamforming algorithm are validated through (i) full-wave EM simulations and (ii) numerical spectral efficiency evaluations. Simulation results confirm that the proposed ER-FAS significantly enhances spectral efficiency compared to conventional antenna arrays. To further validate this design, we fabricate hardware prototypes for both the ER-FAS element and array, using Galinstan liquid metal alloy, fluid silver paste, and software-controlled fluidic channels. The simulation results are experimentally verified through prototype measurements conducted in an anechoic chamber. Additionally, indoor communication trials are conducted via a pair of software-defined radios which demonstrate superior received power and bit error rate performance of the ER-FAS prototype. This work presents the first demonstration of a liquid-based ER-FAS in array configuration for enhancing communication systems.

Title: ReVeal: A Physics-Informed Neural Network for High-Fidelity Radio Environment Mapping
Authors: Mukaram Shahid, Kunal Das, Hadia Ushaq, Hongwei Zhang, Jimming Song, Daji Qiao, Sarath Babu, Yong Guan, Zhengyuan Zhu, Arsalan Ahmed
Abstract: Accurately mapping the radio environment (e.g., identifying wireless signal strength at specific frequency bands and geographic locations) is crucial for efficient spectrum sharing, enabling secondary users (SUs) to access underutilized spectrum bands while protecting primary users (PUs). However, current models are either not generalizable due to shadowing, interference, and fading or are computationally too expensive, limiting real-world applicability. To address the shortcomings of existing models, we derive a second-order partial differential equation (PDE) for the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) based on a statistical model used in the literature. We then propose ReVeal (Re-constructor and Visualizer of Spectrum Landscape), a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) that integrates the PDE residual into a neural network loss function to accurately model the radio environment based on sparse RF sensor measurements. ReVeal is validated using real-world measurement data from the rural and suburban areas of the ARA testbed and benchmarked against existing this http URL outperforms the existing methods in predicting the radio environment; for instance, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of only 1.95 dB, ReVeal achieves an accuracy that is an order of magnitude higher than existing methods such as the 3GPP and ITU-R channel models, ray-tracing, and neural networks. ReVeal achieves both high accuracy and low computational complexity while only requiring sparse RF sampling, for instance, only requiring 30 training sample points across an area of 514 square kilometers.

Title: Assessing the Performance and Impact of PV Technologies on Storage in Hybrid Renewable Systems
Authors: Sharaf K. Magableh, Oraib Dawaghreh, Xuesong Wang, Caisheng Wang
Abstract: Traditional monofacial photovoltaic (mPV) systems are commonly adopted and well-documented because of their lower upfront costs in comparison to bifacial photovoltaic (bPV) systems. This study investigates how PV technologies impact energy storage in grid-scale hybrid renewable systems, focusing on optimizing and assessing the performance of mPV and bPV technologies integrated with pumped storage hydropower. Using Ludington City, Michigan as a case study and analyzing realworld data such as solar irradiance, ambient temperature, and utility-scale load profiles, the research highlights the operational and economic benefits of bPV systems. The results reveal that bPV systems can pump approximately 10.38% more water annually to the upper reservoir while achieving a lower levelized cost of energy ($0.0578/kWh for bPV vs. $0.0672/kWh for mPV). This study underscores the outstanding potential of bPV systems in enhancing energy storage and management strategies, contributing to a more sustainable and resilient renewable energy future.

Title: SuPreME: A Supervised Pre-training Framework for Multimodal ECG Representation Learning
Authors: Mingsheng Cai, Jiuming Jiang, Wenhao Huang, Che Liu, Rossella Arcucci
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings are critical for diagnosing and monitoring cardiac health, but obtaining large-scale annotated ECG datasets is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recent ECG Self-Supervised Learning (eSSL) methods mitigate this by learning features without extensive labels but fail to capture fine-grained clinical semantics and require extensive task-specific fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SuPreME}$, a $\textbf{Su}$pervised $\textbf{Pre}$-training framework for $\textbf{M}$ultimodal $\textbf{E}$CG representation learning. SuPreME applies Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract structured clinical entities from free-text ECG reports, filter out noise and irrelevant content, enhance clinical representation learning, and build a high-quality, fine-grained labeled dataset. By using text-based cardiac queries instead of traditional categorical labels, SuPreME enables zero-shot classification of unseen diseases without additional fine-tuning. We evaluate SuPreME on six downstream datasets covering 127 cardiac conditions, achieving superior zero-shot AUC performance over state-of-the-art eSSL and multimodal methods by over 1.96\%. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of SuPreME in leveraging structured, clinically relevant knowledge for high-quality ECG representations. All code and data will be released upon acceptance.

Title: Dual-branch Graph Feature Learning for NLOS Imaging
Authors: Xiongfei Su, Tianyi Zhu, Lina Liu, Zheng Chen, Yulun Zhang, Siyuan Li, Juntian Ye, Feihu Xu, Xin Yuan
Abstract: The domain of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging is advancing rapidly, offering the capability to reveal occluded scenes that are not directly visible. However, contemporary NLOS systems face several significant challenges: (1) The computational and storage requirements are profound due to the inherent three-dimensional grid data structure, which restricts practical application. (2) The simultaneous reconstruction of albedo and depth information requires a delicate balance using hyperparameters in the loss function, rendering the concurrent reconstruction of texture and depth information difficult. This paper introduces the innovative methodology, \xnet, which integrates an albedo-focused reconstruction branch dedicated to albedo information recovery and a depth-focused reconstruction branch that extracts geometrical structure, to overcome these obstacles. The dual-branch framework segregates content delivery to the respective reconstructions, thereby enhancing the quality of the retrieved data. To our knowledge, we are the first to employ the GNN as a fundamental component to transform dense NLOS grid data into sparse structural features for efficient reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method attains the highest level of performance among existing methods across synthetic and real data. this https URL.

Title: A Residual Multi-task Network for Joint Classification and Regression in Medical Imaging
Authors: Junji Lin, Yi Zhang, Yunyue Pan, Yuli Chen, Chengchang Pan, Honggang Qi
Abstract: Detection and classification of pulmonary nodules is a challenge in medical image analysis due to the variety of shapes and sizes of nodules and their high concealment. Despite the success of traditional deep learning methods in image classification, deep networks still struggle to perfectly capture subtle changes in lung nodule detection. Therefore, we propose a residual multi-task network (Res-MTNet) model, which combines multi-task learning and residual learning, and improves feature representation ability by sharing feature extraction layer and introducing residual connections. Multi-task learning enables the model to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, while the residual module solves the problem of disappearing gradients, ensuring stable training of deeper networks and facilitating information sharing between tasks. Res-MTNet enhances the robustness and accuracy of the model, providing a more reliable lung nodule analysis tool for clinical medicine and telemedicine.

Title: Dynamics on Lie groups with applications to attitude estimation
Authors: T. Forrest Kieffer, Michael Wall
Abstract: The problem of filtering - propagation of probability densities through stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and association of measurement data using Bayesian inference - of objects whose state space forms a Lie group is considered. Particular emphasis is given to concentrated Gaussians (CGs) as a parametric family of probability distributions to capture the uncertainty associated with an estimated group element. The so-called group-affine property of the vector field governing the state time evolution is shown to be a necessary and sufficient condition for the linearity of the dynamics expressed in terms of exponential coordinates, in turn implying the family of CGs is invariant under such evolution. A physically-motivated SDE on the group is then reformulated as an SDE on the associated Lie algebra via exponential coordinates. The vector space structure of the Lie algebra together with the notion of a CG enables the leveraging of techniques from conventional Gaussian-based Kalman filtering in an approach called the tangent space filter (TSF). We provide example calculations for several Lie groups that arise in the problem of estimating position, velocity, and orientation of a rigid body from a noisy, potentially biased inertial measurement unit (IMU). For the specific problem of attitude estimation, it is shown through numerical experiments that TSF-based approaches are more accurate and robust than another widely used attitude filtering technique.

Title: Transient Stability Analysis and Fault Clearing Angle Estimation of VSG Based on Domain of Attraction Estimated by Trajectory Reversing Method
Authors: Jiayue Lyu, Tianzhi Fang, Zhiheng Lin, Jingxue Han, Yantao Zhu
Abstract: The virtual synchronous generator (VSG), with the analogous nonlinear power-angle relationship to the synchronous generator (SG), has attracted much attention as a promising solution for converter-based power systems. In this paper, a large signal model of the grid-connected VSG is first established. The trajectory reversing method (TRM) is then introduced to estimate the domain of attraction (DOA) of VSG. Subsequently, the transient instability mechanism is revealed in detail based on the estimated DOA boundary. The impacts of system parameters on the DOA range are further investigated. It is found that loss of synchronization (LOS) occurs if the system trajectory lies outside the post-fault DOA range. In scenarios where no equilibrium points exist after a grid fault, system stability can be reestablished only when the fault clearing angle (FCA) does not exceed the critical clearing angle (CCA). Finally, the CCA derived from the DOA and that from the conventional equal area criteria (EAC) are compared. The results show that CCA obtained by our solution has a higher accuracy. Time-domain simulations are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed transient stability analysis method of grid-connected VSG.

Title: Deep Learning-Based Approach for Automatic 2D and 3D MRI Segmentation of Gliomas
Authors: Kiranmayee Janardhan, Christy Bobby T
Abstract: Brain tumor diagnosis is a challenging task for clinicians in the modern world. Among the major reasons for cancer-related death is the brain tumor. Gliomas, a category of central nervous system (CNS) tumors, encompass diverse subregions. For accurate diagnosis of brain tumors, precise segmentation of brain images and quantitative analysis are required. A fully automatic approach to glioma segmentation is required because the manual segmentation process is laborious, prone to mistakes, as well as time-consuming. Modern techniques for segmenting gliomas are based on fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs), which can either use two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) convolutions. Nevertheless, 3D convolutions suffer from computational costs and memory demand, while 2D convolutions cannot fully utilize the spatial insights of volumetric clinical imaging data. To obtain an optimal solution, it is vital to balance the computational efficiency of 2D convolutions along with the spatial accuracy of 3D convolutions. This balance can potentially be realized by developing an advanced model to overcome these challenges. The 2D and 3D models implemented here are based on UNET architecture, Inception, and ResNet models. The research work has been implemented on the BraTS 2018, 2019, and 2020 datasets. The best performer of all the models' evaluations metrics for proposed methodologies offer superior potential in terms of the effective segmentation of gliomas. The ResNet model has resulted in 98.91% accuracy for 3D segmentation and 99.77 for 2D segmentations. The dice scores for 2D and 3D segmentations are 0.8312 and 0.9888, respectively. This model can be applied to various other medical applications with fine-tuning, thereby aiding clinicians in brain tumor analysis and improving the diagnosis process effectively.

Title: From Data to Sliding Mode Control of Uncertain Large-Scale Networks with Unknown Dynamics
Authors: Behrad Samari, Gian Paolo Incremona, Antonella Ferrara, Abolfazl Lavaei
Abstract: Large-scale interconnected networks, composed of multiple low-dimensional subsystems, serve as a crucial framework for modeling a wide range of real-world applications. Despite offering computational scalability, the inherent interdependence among subsystems poses significant challenges to the effective control of such networks. This complexity is further exacerbated in the presence of external perturbations and when the dynamics of individual subsystems, and accordingly the overall network, are unknown-scenarios frequently encountered in modern practical applications. In this paper, we develop a compositional data-driven approach to ensure the global asymptotic stability (GAS) of large-scale nonlinear networks with unknown mathematical models, subjected to external perturbations. To achieve this, we first gather two sets of data from each unknown nominal subsystem without perturbation, which we refer to as two input-state trajectories. The collected data from each subsystem is then utilized to design an input-to-state stable (ISS) Lyapunov function and its corresponding controller for each nominal subsystem, rendering them ISS. To cancel the effect of external perturbations on the dynamic of each subsystem, and accordingly the whole network, we then design a local integral sliding mode (ISM) controller for each subsystem using the collected data. Under a small-gain compositional condition, we employ data-driven ISS Lyapunov functions designed for subsystems and construct a control Lyapunov function for the network, rendering the assurance of GAS property over the nominal network. We then extend this compositional result to network perturbed models, demonstrating that the synthesized ISM controllers ensure the GAS property even in the presence of perturbations.

Title: Transformer-Based Nonlinear Transform Coding for Multi-Rate CSI Compression in MIMO-OFDM Systems
Authors: Bumsu Park, Heedong Do, Namyoon Lee
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for channel state information (CSI) compression in multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems, where the frequency-domain channel matrix is treated as a high-dimensional complex-valued image. Our method leverages transformer-based nonlinear transform coding (NTC), an advanced deep-learning-driven image compression technique that generates a highly compact binary representation of the CSI. Unlike conventional autoencoder-based CSI compression, NTC optimizes a nonlinear mapping to produce a latent vector while simultaneously estimating its probability distribution for efficient entropy coding. By exploiting the statistical independence of latent vector entries, we integrate a transformer-based deep neural network with a scalar nested-lattice uniform quantization scheme, enabling low-complexity, multi-rate CSI feedback that dynamically adapts to varying feedback channel conditions. The proposed multi-rate CSI compression scheme achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance, outperforming existing techniques with the same number of neural network parameters. Simulation results further demonstrate that our approach provides a superior rate-distortion trade-off, requiring only 6% of the neural network parameters compared to existing methods, making it highly efficient for practical deployment.

Title: NeRFCom: Feature Transform Coding Meets Neural Radiance Field for Free-View 3D Scene Semantic Transmission
Authors: Weijie Yue, Zhongwei Si, Bolin Wu, Sixian Wang, Xiaoqi Qin, Kai Niu, Jincheng Dai, Ping Zhang
Abstract: We introduce NeRFCom, a novel communication system designed for end-to-end 3D scene transmission. Compared to traditional systems relying on handcrafted NeRF semantic feature decomposition for compression and well-adaptive channel coding for transmission error correction, our NeRFCom employs a nonlinear transform and learned probabilistic models, enabling flexible variable-rate joint source-channel coding and efficient bandwidth allocation aligned with the NeRF semantic feature's different contribution to the 3D scene synthesis fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that NeRFCom achieves free-view 3D scene efficient transmission while maintaining robustness under adverse channel conditions.

Title: PrimeK-Net: Multi-scale Spectral Learning via Group Prime-Kernel Convolutional Neural Networks for Single Channel Speech Enhancement
Authors: Zizhen Lin, Junyu Wang, Ruili Li, Fei Shen, Xi Xuan
Abstract: Single-channel speech enhancement is a challenging ill-posed problem focused on estimating clean speech from degraded signals. Existing studies have demonstrated the competitive performance of combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with Transformers in speech enhancement tasks. However, existing frameworks have not sufficiently addressed computational efficiency and have overlooked the natural multi-scale distribution of the spectrum. Additionally, the potential of CNNs in speech enhancement has yet to be fully realized. To address these issues, this study proposes a Deep Separable Dilated Dense Block (DSDDB) and a Group Prime Kernel Feedforward Channel Attention (GPFCA) module. Specifically, the DSDDB introduces higher parameter and computational efficiency to the Encoder/Decoder of existing frameworks. The GPFCA module replaces the position of the Conformer, extracting deep temporal and frequency features of the spectrum with linear complexity. The GPFCA leverages the proposed Group Prime Kernel Feedforward Network (GPFN) to integrate multi-granularity long-range, medium-range, and short-range receptive fields, while utilizing the properties of prime numbers to avoid periodic overlap effects. Experimental results demonstrate that PrimeK-Net, proposed in this study, achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the VoiceBank+Demand dataset, reaching a PESQ score of 3.61 with only 1.41M parameters.

Title: Model-Free Privacy Preserving Power Flow Analysis in Distribution Networks
Authors: Dong Liu, Juan S. Giraldo, Peter Palensky, Pedro P. Vergara
Abstract: Model-free power flow calculation, driven by the rise of smart meter (SM) data and the lack of network topology, often relies on artificial intelligence neural networks (ANNs). However, training ANNs require vast amounts of SM data, posing privacy risks for households in distribution networks. To ensure customers' privacy during the SM data gathering and online sharing, we introduce a privacy preserving PF calculation framework, composed of two local strategies: a local randomisation strategy (LRS) and a local zero-knowledge proof (ZKP)-based data collection strategy. First, the LRS is used to achieve irreversible transformation and robust privacy protection for active and reactive power data, thereby ensuring that personal data remains confidential. Subsequently, the ZKP-based data collecting strategy is adopted to securely gather the training dataset for the ANN, enabling SMs to interact with the distribution system operator without revealing the actual voltage magnitude. Moreover, to mitigate the accuracy loss induced by the seasonal variations in load profiles, an incremental learning strategy is incorporated into the online application. The results across three datasets with varying measurement errors demonstrate that the proposed framework efficiently collects one month of SM data within one hour. Furthermore, it robustly maintains mean errors of 0.005 p.u. and 0.014 p.u. under multiple measurement errors and seasonal variations in load profiles, respectively.

Title: RIS-Aided Positioning Under Adverse Conditions: Interference from Unauthorized RIS
Authors: Mengting Li, Hui Chen, Alireza Pourafzal, Henk Wymeersch
Abstract: Positioning technology, which aims to determine the geometric information of a device in a global coordinate, is a key component in integrated sensing and communication systems. In addition to traditional active anchor-based positioning systems, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have shown great potential for enhancing system performance. However, their ability to manipulate electromagnetic waves and ease of deployment pose potential risks, as unauthorized RIS may be intentionally introduced to jeopardize the positioning service. Such an unauthorized RIS can cause unexpected interference in the original localization system, distorting the transmitted signals, and leading to degraded positioning accuracy. In this work, we investigate the scenario of RIS-aided positioning in the presence of interference from an unauthorized RIS. Theoretical lower bounds are employed to analyze the impact of unauthorized RIS on channel parameter estimation and positioning accuracy. Several codebook design strategies for unauthorized RIS are evaluated, and various system arrangements are discussed. The simulation results show that an unauthorized RIS path with a high channel gain or a delay similar to that of legitimate RIS paths leads to poor positioning performance. Furthermore, unauthorized RIS generates more effective interference when using directional beamforming codebooks compared to random codebooks.

Title: Convergence Guarantees of Model-free Policy Gradient Methods for LQR with Stochastic Data
Authors: Bowen Song, Andrea Iannelli
Abstract: Policy gradient (PG) methods are the backbone of many reinforcement learning algorithms due to their good performance in policy optimization problems. As a gradient-based approach, PG methods typically rely on knowledge of the system dynamics. However, this information is not always available, and in such cases, trajectory data can be utilized to approximate first-order information. When the data are noisy, gradient estimates become inaccurate and a formal investigation that encompasses uncertainty estimation and the analysis of its propagation through the algorithm is currently missing. To address this, our work focuses on the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem for systems subject to additive stochastic noise. After briefly summarizing the state of the art for cases with a known model, we focus on scenarios where the system dynamics are unknown, and approximate gradient information is obtained using zeroth-order optimization techniques. We analyze the theoretical properties by computing the error in the estimated gradient and examining how this error affects the convergence of PG algorithms. Additionally, we provide global convergence guarantees for various versions of PG methods, including those employing adaptive step sizes and variance reduction techniques, which help increase the convergence rate and reduce sample complexity. One contribution of this work is the study of the robustness of model-free PG methods, aiming to identify their limitations in the presence of noise and propose improvements to enhance their applicability. Numerical simulations show that these theoretical analyses provide valuable guidance in tuning the algorithm parameters, thereby making these methods more reliable in practically relevant scenarios.

Title: On Outage Analysis of OTFS Based LEO-Satellite Systems With HAPS Relaying
Authors: Burak Ahmet Celebi, Omer Faruk Akyol, Semiha Tedik Basaran, Ibrahim Hokelek, Ali Gorcin
Abstract: This paper presents an Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) waveform application along with a high altitude platform station (HAPS) relaying for remedying severe Doppler effects in non-terrestrial networks (NTNs). Taking practical challenges into consideration, HAPS is exploited as a decode and forward relay node to mitigate the high path loss between a satellite and a base station (BS). In addition, a maximum ratio transmission scheme with multiple antennas at the LEO-satellite is utilized to maximize Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). A shadowed Rician fading model is employed for the channel realization between the LEO-satellite and the HAPS while Nakagami-m is used between the HAPS and the BS. We derive the closed-form expression of the outage probability (OP) for the end-to-end system. The theoretical and simulation results demonstrate that the OP can significantly decrease when the OTFS order and the number of transmit antennas increase.

Title: Data-Driven Mean Field Equilibrium Computation in Large-Population LQG Games
Authors: Zhenhui Xu, Jiayu Chen, Bing-Chang Wang, Tielong Shen
Abstract: This paper presents a novel data-driven approach for approximating the $\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium in continuous-time linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) games, where multiple agents interact with each other through their dynamics and infinite horizon discounted costs. The core of our method involves solving two algebraic Riccati equations (AREs) and an ordinary differential equation (ODE) using state and input samples collected from agents, eliminating the need for a priori knowledge of their dynamical models. The standard ARE is addressed through an integral reinforcement learning (IRL) technique, while the nonsymmetric ARE and the ODE are resolved by identifying the drift coefficients of the agents' dynamics under general conditions. Moreover, by imposing specific conditions on models, we extend the IRL-based approach to approximately solve the nonsymmetric ARE. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

Title: Data-Driven Model Identification of Unbalanced Induction Motor Dynamics and Forces using SINDYc
Authors: Emma Vancayseele, Philip Desenfans, Zifeng Gong, Dries Vanoost, Herbert De Gersem, Davy Pissoort
Abstract: This paper identifies the stator currents, torque and unbalanced magnetic pull (UMP) of an unbalanced induction motor by the System Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics with Control (SINDYc) method from time-series data of measurable quantities. The SINDYc model has been trained on data coming from a nonlinear magnetic equivalent circuit model for three rotor eccentricity configurations. When evaluating the SINDYc model for static eccentricity, torques and UMPs with excellent accuracies, i.e., 8.8 mNm and 4.87 N of mean absolute error, respectively, are found. When compared with a reference torque equation, this amounts to a 65% error reduction. For dynamic eccentricity, the estimation is more difficult. The SINDYc model is fast enough to be embedded in a control procedure.

Title: Dynamic Energy Flow Analysis of Integrated Electricity and Gas Systems: A Semi-Analytical Approach
Authors: Zhikai Huang, Shuai Lu, Wei Gu, Ruizhi Yu, Suhan Zhang, Yijun Xu, Yuan Li
Abstract: Ensuring the safe and reliable operation of integrated electricity and gas systems (IEGS) requires dynamic energy flow (DEF) simulation tools that achieve high accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the inherent strong nonlinearity of gas dynamics and its bidirectional coupling with power grids impose significant challenges on conventional numerical algorithms, particularly in computational efficiency and accuracy. Considering this, we propose a novel non-iterative semi-analytical algorithm based on differential transformation (DT) for DEF simulation of IEGS. First, we introduce a semi-discrete difference method to convert the partial differential algebraic equations of the DEF model into ordinary differential algebraic equations to resort to the DT. Particularly, by employing spatial central difference and numerical boundary extrapolation, we effectively avoid the singularity issue of the DT coefficient matrix. Second, we propose a DT-based semi-analytical solution method, which can yield the solution of the DEF model by recursion. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

Title: Robust Mean Field Social Control: A Unified Reinforcement Learning Framework
Authors: Zhenhui Xu, Jiayu Chen, Bing-Chang Wang, Yuhu Wu, Tielong Shen
Abstract: This paper studies linear quadratic Gaussian robust mean field social control problems in the presence of multiplicative noise. We aim to compute asymptotic decentralized strategies without requiring full prior knowledge of agents' dynamics. The primary challenges lie in solving an indefinite stochastic algebraic Riccati equation for feedback gains, and an indefinite algebraic Riccati equation for feedforward gains. To overcome these challenges, we first propose a unified dual-loop iterative framework that simultaneously handles both indefinite Riccati-type equations, and provide rigorous convergence proofs for both outer-loop and inner-loop iterations. Second, recognizing that biases may arise in iterative processes due to estimation and modeling errors, we analyze the robustness of the proposed algorithm by using the small-disturbance input-to-state stability technique. This ensures convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal solution, even in the existence of disturbances. Finally, to address the limitation of requiring precise knowledge of agents' dynamics, we employ the integral reinforcement learning technique to develop a data-driven method within the dual-loop iterative framework. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Authors: Nian Shao, Rui Zhou, Pengyu Wang, Xian Li, Ying Fang, Yujie Yang, Xiaofei Li
Abstract: In this work, we propose CleanMel, a single-channel Mel-spectrogram denoising and dereverberation network for improving both speech quality and automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance. The proposed network takes as input the noisy and reverberant microphone recording and predicts the corresponding clean Mel-spectrogram. The enhanced Mel-spectrogram can be either transformed to speech waveform with a neural vocoder or directly used for ASR. The proposed network is composed of interleaved cross-band and narrow-band processing in the Mel-frequency domain, for learning the full-band spectral pattern and the narrow-band properties of signals, respectively. Compared to linear-frequency domain or time-domain speech enhancement, the key advantage of Mel-spectrogram enhancement is that Mel-frequency presents speech in a more compact way and thus is easier to learn, which will benefit both speech quality and ASR. Experimental results on four English and one Chinese datasets demonstrate a significant improvement in both speech quality and ASR performance achieved by the proposed model. Code and audio examples of our model are available online in this https URL.

Title: UniCodec: Unified Audio Codec with Single Domain-Adaptive Codebook
Authors: Yidi Jiang, Qian Chen, Shengpeng Ji, Yu Xi, Wen Wang, Chong Zhang, Xianghu Yue, ShiLiang Zhang, Haizhou Li
Abstract: The emergence of audio language models is empowered by neural audio codecs, which establish critical mappings between continuous waveforms and discrete tokens compatible with language model paradigms. The evolutionary trends from multi-layer residual vector quantizer to single-layer quantizer are beneficial for language-autoregressive decoding. However, the capability to handle multi-domain audio signals through a single codebook remains constrained by inter-domain distribution discrepancies. In this work, we introduce UniCodec, a unified audio codec with a single codebook to support multi-domain audio data, including speech, music, and sound. To achieve this, we propose a partitioned domain-adaptive codebook method and domain Mixture-of-Experts strategy to capture the distinct characteristics of each audio domain. Furthermore, to enrich the semantic density of the codec without auxiliary modules, we propose a self-supervised mask prediction modeling approach. Comprehensive objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that UniCodec achieves excellent audio reconstruction performance across the three audio domains, outperforming existing unified neural codecs with a single codebook, and even surpasses state-of-the-art domain-specific codecs on both acoustic and semantic representation capabilities.

Title: Comparative Performance Analysis of Numerical Discretization Methods for Electrochemical Models of Lithium-ion Batteries
Authors: Feng Guo, Luis D. Couto
Abstract: This study evaluates numerical discretization methods for lithium-ion battery models, including Finite Difference Method (FDM), spectral methods, Padé approximation, and parabolic approximation. The evaluation criteria are accuracy, execution time, and memory usage to guide the selection of numerical discretization methods for electrochemical models. Under constant current conditions, FDM explicit Euler and Runge-Kutta methods show significant errors. The FDM implicit Euler method improves accuracy with more nodes. The spectral method achieves the best accuracy and convergence with 5 nodes. Both FDM implicit Euler and spectral methods show reduced errors with higher currents. Padé approximation has larger errors, increasing with higher currents, while the parabolic method's error is higher than the converged spectral and FDM implicit Euler methods. Execution time comparison shows the parabolic method as the fastest, followed by Padé approximation. The spectral method outperforms FDM methods, with FDM implicit Euler being the slowest. Memory usage is minimal for parabolic and Padé methods, moderate for FDM methods, and highest for the spectral method. These findings offer insights for selecting appropriate numerical discretization methods in lithium-ion battery models.

Title: Generative augmentations for improved cardiac ultrasound segmentation using diffusion models
Authors: Gilles Van De Vyver, Aksel Try Lenz, Erik Smistad, Sindre Hellum Olaisen, Bjørnar Grenne, Espen Holte, Håavard Dalen, Lasse Løvstakken
Abstract: One of the main challenges in current research on segmentation in cardiac ultrasound is the lack of large and varied labeled datasets and the differences in annotation conventions between datasets. This makes it difficult to design robust segmentation models that generalize well to external datasets. This work utilizes diffusion models to create generative augmentations that can significantly improve diversity of the dataset and thus the generalisability of segmentation models without the need for more annotated data. The augmentations are applied in addition to regular augmentations. A visual test survey showed that experts cannot clearly distinguish between real and fully generated images. Using the proposed generative augmentations, segmentation robustness was increased when training on an internal dataset and testing on an external dataset with an improvement of over 20 millimeters in Hausdorff distance. Additionally, the limits of agreement for automatic ejection fraction estimation improved by up to 20% of absolute ejection fraction value on out of distribution cases. These improvements come exclusively from the increased variation of the training data using the generative augmentations, without modifying the underlying machine learning model. The augmentation tool is available as an open source Python library at this https URL.

Title: Energy-carbon comprehensive efficiency evaluation of hydrogen metallurgy system considering low-temperature waste heat recovery
Authors: Qiang Ji, Lin Cheng, Zeng Liang, Yingrui Zhuang, Fashun Shi, Jianliang Zhang, Kejiang Li
Abstract: To address the lack of energy-carbon efficiency evaluation and the underutilization of low-temperature waste heat in traditional direct reduction iron (DRI) production, this paper proposes a novel zero-carbon hydrogen metallurgy system that integrates the recovery and utilization of low-temperature and high-temperature waste heat, internal energy, and cold energy during hydrogen production, storage, reaction and circulation. Firstly, the detailed mathematical models are developed to describe energy and exergy characteristics of the operational components in the proposed zero-carbon hydrogen metallurgy system. Additionally, energy efficiency, exergy efficiency, and energy-carbon efficiency indices are introduced from a full life-cycle perspective of energy flow, avoiding the overlaps in energy inputs and outputs. Subsequently, the efficiency metrics of the proposed zero-carbon hydrogen metallurgy system are then compared with those of traditional DRI production systems with H$_2$/CO ratios of 6:4 and 8:2. The comparative results demonstrate the superiority and advancement of the proposed zero-carbon hydrogen metallurgy system. Finally, sensitivity analysis reveals that the overall electricity energy generated by incorporating the ORC and expander equipments exceeds the heat energy recovered from the furnace top gas, highlighting the energy potential of waste energy utilization.

Title: Learning the Topology of a Simplicial Complex Using Simplicial Signals: A Greedy Approach
Authors: A. Buciulea, E. Isufi, G. Leus, A. G. Marques
Abstract: Graphs are ubiquitous to model the irregular (non-Euclidean) structure of complex data, but they are limited to pairwise relationships and fail to model the complexities of the datasets exhibiting higher-order interactions. In that context, simplicial complexes (SCs) are emerging as a tractable candidate to handle such domains. The first step in using SC-based processing and learning schemes is to identify the topology of the SC, which is the problem investigated in this paper. In particular, we assume that we observe a number of signals (features) associated with the nodes of the SC (simplices of order 0) as well as signals (features) associated with a subset of the edges of the SC (simplices of order 1). The goal is then to use these signals to learn the remaining edges as well as the triangles that are filled (simplices of order 2). To address this problem, we assume that the signals are smooth on the unknown SC and that the higher-order relations are sparse. We then postulate the learning problem as a nonconvex optimization and develop an efficient (block-coordinate) algorithm to identify the SC topology.

Title: Balanced Rate-Distortion Optimization in Learned Image Compression
Authors: Yichi Zhang, Zhihao Duan, Yuning Huang, Fengqing Zhu
Abstract: Learned image compression (LIC) using deep learning architectures has seen significant advancements, yet standard rate-distortion (R-D) optimization often encounters imbalanced updates due to diverse gradients of the rate and distortion objectives. This imbalance can lead to suboptimal optimization, where one objective dominates, thereby reducing overall compression efficiency. To address this challenge, we reformulate R-D optimization as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem and introduce two balanced R-D optimization strategies that adaptively adjust gradient updates to achieve more equitable improvements in both rate and distortion. The first proposed strategy utilizes a coarse-to-fine gradient descent approach along standard R-D optimization trajectories, making it particularly suitable for training LIC models from scratch. The second proposed strategy analytically addresses the reformulated optimization as a quadratic programming problem with an equality constraint, which is ideal for fine-tuning existing models. Experimental results demonstrate that both proposed methods enhance the R-D performance of LIC models, achieving around a 2\% BD-Rate reduction with acceptable additional training cost, leading to a more balanced and efficient optimization process. The code will be made publicly available.

Title: Voting Scheme to Strengthen Localization Security in Randomly Deployed Wireless Sensor Networks
Authors: Slavisa Tomic, Marko Beko, Dejan Vukobratovic, Srdjan Krco
Abstract: This work aspires to provide a trustworthy solution for target localization in adverse environments, where malicious nodes, capable of manipulating distance measurements (i.e., performing spoofing attacks), are present, thus hindering accurate localization. Besides localization, its other goal is to identify (detect) which of the nodes participating in the process are malicious. This problem becomes extremely important with the forthcoming expansion of IoT and smart cities applications, that depend on accurate localization, and the presence of malicious attackers can represent serious security threats if not taken into consideration. This is the case with most existing localization systems which makes them highly vulnerable to spoofing attacks. In addition, existing methods that are intended for adversarial settings consider very specific settings or require additional knowledge about the system model, making them only partially secure. Therefore, this work proposes a novel voting scheme based on clustering and weighted central mass to securely solve the localization problem and detect attackers. The proposed solution has two main phases: 1) Choosing a cluster of suitable points of interest by taking advantage of the problem geometry to assigning votes in order to localize the target, and 2) Attacker detection by exploiting the location estimate and basic statistics. The proposed method is assessed in terms of localization accuracy, success in attacker detection, and computational complexity in different settings. Computer simulations and real-world experiments corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme compared to state-of-the-art methods, showing that it can accomplish an error reduction of $30~\%$ and is capable of achieving almost perfect attacker detection rate when the ratio between attacker intensity and noise standard deviation is significant.

Title: RURANET++: An Unsupervised Learning Method for Diabetic Macular Edema Based on SCSE Attention Mechanisms and Dynamic Multi-Projection Head Clustering
Authors: Wei Yang, Yiran Zhu, Jiayu Shen, Yuhan Tang, Chengchang Pan, Hui He, Yan Su, Honggang Qi
Abstract: Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), a prevalent complication among diabetic patients, constitutes a major cause of visual impairment and blindness. Although deep learning has achieved remarkable progress in medical image analysis, traditional DME diagnosis still relies on extensive annotated data and subjective ophthalmologist assessments, limiting practical applications. To address this, we present RURANET++, an unsupervised learning-based automated DME diagnostic system. This framework incorporates an optimized U-Net architecture with embedded Spatial and Channel Squeeze & Excitation (SCSE) attention mechanisms to enhance lesion feature extraction. During feature processing, a pre-trained GoogLeNet model extracts deep features from retinal images, followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction to 50 dimensions for computational efficiency. Notably, we introduce a novel clustering algorithm employing multi-projection heads to explicitly control cluster diversity while dynamically adjusting similarity thresholds, thereby optimizing intra-class consistency and inter-class discrimination. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance across multiple metrics, achieving maximum accuracy (0.8411), precision (0.8593), recall (0.8411), and F1-score (0.8390), with exceptional clustering quality. This work provides an efficient unsupervised solution for DME diagnosis with significant clinical implications.

Title: Electric power system security: the case for an integrated cyber-physical risk management framework
Authors: Efthymios Karangelos, Louis Wehenkel
Abstract: This paper concerns the security of the electric power transmission grid facing the threat of malicious cyber-physical attackers. We posit that there is no such thing as perfectly effective cyber-security. Rather, any cyber-security measure comes with the possibility that a highly skilled attacker could (eventually find a way to) bypass it. On these grounds, we formulate a tri-level decision making problem seeking to co-optimize preventive physical and cyber-security measures under uncertainty on the ability of an exogenous cyber-physical attacker to overcome the latter. Preventive physical security measures refer to the \emph{ex-ante} procurement of reserve capacity, which translates into ramping restrictions in real-time. Cyber-security measures refer to updating the firewall rules so as to impede an intruder from taking over the cyber infrastructure of the grid and disconnecting power generators and transmission branches. We adopt standard assumptions to formalize the inner optimization problems corresponding to the cyber-physical attacker and power grid operator and focus on uncertainty management at the uppermost level of the problem. Our findings establish that physical- and cyber-security measures are non-exchangeable complements in keeping the power grid operation secure.

Title: T1-PILOT: Optimized Trajectories for T1 Mapping Acceleration
Authors: Tamir Shor, Moti Freiman, Chaim Baskin, Alex Bronstein
Abstract: Cardiac T1 mapping provides critical quantitative insights into myocardial tissue composition, enabling the assessment of pathologies such as fibrosis, inflammation, and edema. However, the inherently dynamic nature of the heart imposes strict limits on acquisition times, making high-resolution T1 mapping a persistent challenge. Compressed sensing (CS) approaches have reduced scan durations by undersampling k-space and reconstructing images from partial data, and recent studies show that jointly optimizing the undersampling patterns with the reconstruction network can substantially improve performance. Still, most current T1 mapping pipelines rely on static, hand-crafted masks that do not exploit the full acceleration and accuracy potential. In this work, we introduce T1-PILOT: an end-to-end method that explicitly incorporates the T1 signal relaxation model into the sampling-reconstruction framework to guide the learning of non-Cartesian trajectories, crossframe alignment, and T1 decay estimation. Through extensive experiments on the CMRxRecon dataset, T1-PILOT significantly outperforms several baseline strategies (including learned single-mask and fixed radial or golden-angle sampling schemes), achieving higher T1 map fidelity at greater acceleration factors. In particular, we observe consistent gains in PSNR and VIF relative to existing methods, along with marked improvements in delineating finer myocardial structures. Our results highlight that optimizing sampling trajectories in tandem with the physical relaxation model leads to both enhanced quantitative accuracy and reduced acquisition times. Code for reproducing all results will be made publicly available upon publication.

Title: Cell-Free Integrated Sensing and Communication: Principles, Advances, and Future Directions
Authors: Diluka Galappaththige, Mohammadali Mohammadi, Gayan Aruma Baduge, Chintha Tellambura
Abstract: Cell-free (CF) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) combines CF architecture with ISAC. CF employs distributed access points, eliminates cell boundaries, and enhances coverage, spectral efficiency, and reliability. ISAC unifies radar sensing and communication, enabling simultaneous data transmission and environmental sensing within shared spectral and hardware resources. CF-ISAC leverages these strengths to improve spectral and energy efficiency while enhancing sensing in wireless networks. As a promising candidate for next-generation wireless systems, CF-ISAC supports robust multi-user communication, distributed multi-static sensing, and seamless resource optimization. However, a comprehensive survey on CF-ISAC has been lacking. This paper fills that gap by first revisiting CF and ISAC principles, covering cooperative transmission, radar cross-section, target parameter estimation, ISAC integration levels, sensing metrics, and applications. It then explores CF-ISAC systems, emphasizing their unique features and the benefits of multi-static sensing. State-of-the-art developments are categorized into performance analysis, resource allocation, security, and user/target-centric designs, offering a thorough literature review and case studies. Finally, the paper identifies key challenges such as synchronization, multi-target detection, interference management, and fronthaul capacity and latency. Emerging trends, including next-generation antenna technologies, network-assisted systems, near-field CF-ISAC, integration with other technologies, and machine learning approaches, are highlighted to outline the future trajectory of CF-ISAC research.

Title: Modeling Driver Behavior in Speed Advisory Systems: Koopman-based Approach with Online Update
Authors: Mehmet Fatih Ozkan, Jeff Chrstos, Marcello Canova, Stephanie Stockar
Abstract: Accurate driver behavior modeling is essential for improving the interaction and cooperation of the human driver with the driver assistance system. This paper presents a novel approach for modeling the response of human drivers to visual cues provided by a speed advisory system using a Koopman-based method with online updates. The proposed method utilizes the Koopman operator to transform the nonlinear dynamics of driver-speed advisory system interactions into a linear framework, allowing for efficient real-time prediction. An online update mechanism based on Recursive Least Squares (RLS) is integrated into the Koopman-based model to ensure continuous adaptation to changes in driver behavior over time. The model is validated using data collected from a human-in-the-loop driving simulator, capturing diverse driver-specific trajectories. The results demonstrate that the offline learned Koopman-based model can closely predict driver behavior and its accuracy is further enhanced through an online update mechanism with the RLS method.

Title: Improving Simulation-Based Origin-Destination Demand Calibration Using Sample Segment Counts Data
Authors: Arwa Alanqary, Chao Zhang, Yechen Li, Neha Arora, Carolina Osorio
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to demand estimation that utilizes partial observations of segment-level track counts. Building on established simulation-based demand estimation methods, we present a modified formulation that integrates sample track counts as a regularization term. This approach effectively addresses the underdetermination challenge in demand estimation, moving beyond the conventional reliance on a prior OD matrix. The proposed formulation aims to preserve the distribution of the observed track counts while optimizing the demand to align with observed path-level travel times. We tested this approach on Seattle's highway network with various congestion levels. Our findings reveal significant enhancements in the solution quality, particularly in accurately recovering ground truth demand patterns at both the OD and segment levels.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interest in expanding their application beyond text-based tasks. A large number of studies have explored integrating other modalities with LLMs, notably speech modality, which is naturally related to text. This paper surveys the integration of speech with LLMs, categorizing the methodologies into three primary approaches: text-based, latent-representation-based, and audio-token-based integration. We also demonstrate how these methods are applied across various speech-related applications and highlight the challenges in this field to offer inspiration for

Title: Assessing Autonomous Inspection Regimes: Active Versus Passive Satellite Inspection
Authors: Joshua Aurand, Christopher Pang, Sina Mokhtar, Henry Lei, Steven Cutlip, Sean Phillips
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of satellite inspection, where one or more satellites (inspectors) are tasked with imaging or inspecting a resident space object (RSO) due to potential malfunctions or anomalies. Inspection strategies are often reduced to a discretized action space with predefined waypoints, facilitating tractability in both classical optimization and machine learning based approaches. However, this discretization can lead to suboptimal guidance in certain scenarios. This study presents a comparative simulation to explore the tradeoffs of passive versus active strategies in multi-agent missions. Key factors considered include RSO dynamic mode, state uncertainty, unmodeled entrance criteria, and inspector motion types. The evaluation is conducted with a focus on fuel utilization and surface coverage. Building on a Monte-Carlo based evaluator of passive strategies and a reinforcement learning framework for training active inspection policies, this study investigates conditions under which passive strategies, such as Natural Motion Circumnavigation (NMC), may perform comparably to active strategies like Reinforcement Learning based waypoint transfers.

Title: Joint Power Allocation and Phase Shift Design for Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces-aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems with MARL
Authors: Yiyang Zhu, Jiayi Zhang, Enyu Shi, Ziheng Liu, Chau Yuen, Bo Ai
Abstract: Cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems offer high spectral efficiency (SE) through multiple distributed access points (APs). However, the large number of antennas increases power consumption. We propose incorporating stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) into CF mMIMO systems as a cost-effective, energy-efficient solution. This paper focuses on optimizing the joint power allocation of APs and the phase shift of SIMs to maximize the sum SE. To address this complex problem, we introduce a fully distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm. Our novel algorithm, the noisy value method with a recurrent policy in multi-agent policy optimization (NVR-MAPPO), enhances performance by encouraging diverse exploration under centralized training and decentralized execution. Simulations demonstrate that NVR-MAPPO significantly improves sum SE and robustness across various scenarios.

Title: Risk-aware Integrated Task and Motion Planning for Versatile Snake Robots under Localization Failures
Authors: Ashkan Jasour, Guglielmo Daddi, Masafumi Endo, Tiago S. Vaquero, Michael Paton, Marlin P. Strub, Sabrina Corpino, Michel Ingham, Masahiro Ono, Rohan Thakker
Abstract: Snake robots enable mobility through extreme terrains and confined environments in terrestrial and space applications. However, robust perception and localization for snake robots remain an open challenge due to the proximity of the sensor payload to the ground coupled with a limited field of view. To address this issue, we propose Blind-motion with Intermittently Scheduled Scans (BLISS) which combines proprioception-only mobility with intermittent scans to be resilient against both localization failures and collision risks. BLISS is formulated as an integrated Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) problem that leads to a Chance-Constrained Hybrid Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (CC-HPOMDP), known to be computationally intractable due to the curse of history. Our novelty lies in reformulating CC-HPOMDP as a tractable, convex Mixed Integer Linear Program. This allows us to solve BLISS-TAMP significantly faster and jointly derive optimal task-motion plans. Simulations and hardware experiments on the EELS snake robot show our method achieves over an order of magnitude computational improvement compared to state-of-the-art POMDP planners and $>$ 50\% better navigation time optimality versus classical two-stage planners.

Title: Does Your Voice Assistant Remember? Analyzing Conversational Context Recall and Utilization in Voice Interaction Models
Authors: Heeseung Kim, Che Hyun Lee, Sangkwon Park, Jiheum Yeom, Nohil Park, Sangwon Yu, Sungroh Yoon
Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-turn voice interaction models have improved user-model communication. However, while closed-source models effectively retain and recall past utterances, whether open-source models share this ability remains unexplored. To fill this gap, we systematically evaluate how well open-source interaction models utilize past utterances using ContextDialog, a benchmark we proposed for this purpose. Our findings show that speech-based models have more difficulty than text-based ones, especially when recalling information conveyed in speech, and even with retrieval-augmented generation, models still struggle with questions about past utterances. These insights highlight key limitations in open-source models and suggest ways to improve memory retention and retrieval robustness.

Title: LMHLD: A Large-scale Multi-source High-resolution Landslide Dataset for Landslide Detection based on Deep Learning
Authors: Guanting Liu, Yi Wang, Xi Chen, Baoyu Du, Penglei Li, Yuan Wu, Zhice Fang
Abstract: Landslides are among the most common natural disasters globally, posing significant threats to human society. Deep learning (DL) has proven to be an effective method for rapidly generating landslide inventories in large-scale disaster areas. However, DL models rely heavily on high-quality labeled landslide data for strong feature extraction capabilities. And landslide detection using DL urgently needs a benchmark dataset to evaluate the generalization ability of the latest models. To solve the above problems, we construct a Large-scale Multi-source High-resolution Landslide Dataset (LMHLD) for Landslide Detection based on DL. LMHLD collects remote sensing images from five different satellite sensors across seven study areas worldwide: Wenchuan, China (2008); Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (2011); Gorkha, Nepal (2015); Jiuzhaigou, China (2015); Taiwan, China (2018); Hokkaido, Japan (2018); Emilia-Romagna, Italy (2023). The dataset includes a total of 25,365 patches, with different patch sizes to accommodate different landslide scales. Additionally, a training module, LMHLDpart, is designed to accommodate landslide detection tasks at varying scales and to alleviate the issue of catastrophic forgetting in multi-task learning. Furthermore, the models trained by LMHLD is applied in other datasets to highlight the robustness of LMHLD. Five dataset quality evaluation experiments designed by using seven DL models from the U-Net family demonstrate that LMHLD has the potential to become a benchmark dataset for landslide detection. LMHLD is open access and can be accessed through the link: this https URL. This dataset provides a strong foundation for DL models, accelerates the development of DL in landslide detection, and serves as a valuable resource for landslide prevention and mitigation efforts.

Title: Research on Event-Related Desynchronization of Motor Imagery and Movement Based on Localized EEG Cortical Sources
Authors: Yuqing Wang
Abstract: This study investigates event-related desynchronization (ERD) phenomena during motor imagery and actual movement. Using sLORETA software, we analyzed the cortical current source density distributions in Mu and Beta frequency bands for 33 subjects during rest, motor imagery, and actual movement conditions. The results were normalized for analysis. Using sLORETA's statistical tools, paired t-tests were conducted to compare the normalized current source density results between rest and motor imagery, rest and actual movement, and motor imagery and actual movement conditions in both frequency bands. The findings revealed: In both Mu and Beta frequency bands, during motor imagery, significant ERD (P<0.01) was observed in the salience network, supplementary motor area, primary motor area, premotor cortex, primary somatosensory cortex, and parietofrontal mirror neuron system. During actual movement, significant ERD (P<0.05) was observed in the primary somatosensory cortex, primary motor area, and parietofrontal mirror neuron system in both frequency bands. Comparing motor imagery to actual movement, the current source density in the primary somatosensory cortex and parietofrontal mirror neuron system was higher during motor imagery, though this difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05). This paper analyzes the factors contributing to these statistical results and proposes preliminary solutions.

Title: DiffCSS: Diverse and Expressive Conversational Speech Synthesis with Diffusion Models
Authors: Weihao wu, Zhiwei Lin, Yixuan Zhou, Jingbei Li, Rui Niu, Qinghua Wu, Songjun Cao, Long Ma, Zhiyong Wu
Abstract: Conversational speech synthesis (CSS) aims to synthesize both contextually appropriate and expressive speech, and considerable efforts have been made to enhance the understanding of conversational context. However, existing CSS systems are limited to deterministic prediction, overlooking the diversity of potential responses. Moreover, they rarely employ language model (LM)-based TTS backbones, limiting the naturalness and quality of synthesized speech. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose DiffCSS, an innovative CSS framework that leverages diffusion models and an LM-based TTS backbone to generate diverse, expressive, and contextually coherent speech. A diffusion-based context-aware prosody predictor is proposed to sample diverse prosody embeddings conditioned on multimodal conversational context. Then a prosody-controllable LM-based TTS backbone is developed to synthesize high-quality speech with sampled prosody embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate that the synthesized speech from DiffCSS is more diverse, contextually coherent, and expressive than existing CSS systems

Title: A differential game approach to intrinsic encirclement control
Authors: Panpan Zhou, Yueyue Xu, Yibei Li, Bo Wahlberg, Xiaoming Hu
Abstract: This paper investigates the encirclement control problem involving two groups using a non-cooperative differential game approach. The active group seeks to chase and encircle the passive group, while the passive group responds by fleeing cooperatively and simultaneously encircling the active group. Instead of prescribing an expected radius or a predefined path for encirclement, we focus on the whole formation manifold of the desired relative configuration, two concentric circles, by allowing permutation, rotation, and translation of players. The desired relative configurations arise as the steady state resulting from Nash equilibrium strategies and are achieved in an intrinsic way by designing the interaction graphs and weight function of each edge. Furthermore, the asymptotic convergence to the desired manifold is guaranteed. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate encirclement and counter-encirclement scenarios, verifying the effectiveness of our strategies.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a widely used non-invasive physiological sensing technique, suitable for various clinical applications. Such clinical applications are increasingly supported by machine learning methods, raising the question of the most appropriate input representation and model choice. Comprehensive comparisons, in particular across different input representations, are scarce. We address this gap in the research landscape by a comprehensive benchmarking study covering three kinds of input representations, interpretable features, image representations and raw waveforms, across prototypical regression and classification use cases: blood pressure and atrial fibrillation prediction. In both cases, the best results are achieved by deep neural networks operating on raw time series as input representations. Within this model class, best results are achieved by modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs). but depending on the task setup, shallow CNNs are often also very competitive. We envision that these results will be insightful for researchers to guide their choice on machine learning tasks for PPG data, even beyond the use cases presented in this work.

Title: On Performance of FAS-aided Covert Communications
Authors: Farshad Rostami Ghadi, Masoud Kaveh, Riku Jantti, F. Javier Lopez-Martinez
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of deploying the fluid antenna system (FAS) on the performance of covert communications. In particular, we focus on a scenario where a transmitter seeks to covertly communicate with a receiver, while a warden attempts to detect the transmission. Both the receiver and the warden are assumed to utilize planar FAS. We derive compact analytical expressions for the covertness outage probability (COP), defined as the complement of the sum of false alarm (FA) and missed detection (MD) probabilities. By determining the optimal detection threshold that maximizes the COP, we characterize the success probability for the legitimate transmission, highlighting the trade-off between covertness and transmission success. Our numerical results confirm that while deploying FAS at the warden enhances its detection ability compared to fixed-position antennas (FPAs), equipping the receiver with FAS rather than FPAs significantly improves reception quality, leading to more reliable transmission.

Title: Multi-Keypoint Affordance Representation for Functional Dexterous Grasping
Authors: Fan Yang, Dongsheng Luo, Wenrui Chen, Jiacheng Lin, Junjie Cai, Kailun Yang, Zhiyong Li, Yaonan Wang
Abstract: Functional dexterous grasping requires precise hand-object interaction, going beyond simple gripping. Existing affordance-based methods primarily predict coarse interaction regions and cannot directly constrain the grasping posture, leading to a disconnection between visual perception and manipulation. To address this issue, we propose a multi-keypoint affordance representation for functional dexterous grasping, which directly encodes task-driven grasp configurations by localizing functional contact points. Our method introduces Contact-guided Multi-Keypoint Affordance (CMKA), leveraging human grasping experience images for weak supervision combined with Large Vision Models for fine affordance feature extraction, achieving generalization while avoiding manual keypoint annotations. Additionally, we present a Keypoint-based Grasp matrix Transformation (KGT) method, ensuring spatial consistency between hand keypoints and object contact points, thus providing a direct link between visual perception and dexterous grasping actions. Experiments on public real-world FAH datasets, IsaacGym simulation, and challenging robotic tasks demonstrate that our method significantly improves affordance localization accuracy, grasp consistency, and generalization to unseen tools and tasks, bridging the gap between visual affordance learning and dexterous robotic manipulation. The source code and demo videos will be publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Offline Reinforcement Learning via Inverse Optimization
Authors: Ioannis Dimanidis, Tolga Ok, Peyman Mohajerin Esfahani
Abstract: Inspired by the recent successes of Inverse Optimization (IO) across various application domains, we propose a novel offline Reinforcement Learning (ORL) algorithm for continuous state and action spaces, leveraging the convex loss function called ``sub-optimality loss" from the IO literature. To mitigate the distribution shift commonly observed in ORL problems, we further employ a robust and non-causal Model Predictive Control (MPC) expert steering a nominal model of the dynamics using in-hindsight information stemming from the model mismatch. Unlike the existing literature, our robust MPC expert enjoys an exact and tractable convex reformulation. In the second part of this study, we show that the IO hypothesis class, trained by the proposed convex loss function, enjoys ample expressiveness and achieves competitive performance comparing with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the low-data regime of the MuJoCo benchmark while utilizing three orders of magnitude fewer parameters, thereby requiring significantly fewer computational resources. To facilitate the reproducibility of our results, we provide an open-source package implementing the proposed algorithms and the experiments.

Title: Night-Voyager: Consistent and Efficient Nocturnal Vision-Aided State Estimation in Object Maps
Authors: Tianxiao Gao, Mingle Zhao, Chengzhong Xu, Hui Kong
Abstract: Accurate and robust state estimation at nighttime is essential for autonomous robotic navigation to achieve nocturnal or round-the-clock tasks. An intuitive question arises: Can low-cost standard cameras be exploited for nocturnal state estimation? Regrettably, most existing visual methods may fail under adverse illumination conditions, even with active lighting or image enhancement. A pivotal insight, however, is that streetlights in most urban scenarios act as stable and salient prior visual cues at night, reminiscent of stars in deep space aiding spacecraft voyage in interstellar navigation. Inspired by this, we propose Night-Voyager, an object-level nocturnal vision-aided state estimation framework that leverages prior object maps and keypoints for versatile localization. We also find that the primary limitation of conventional visual methods under poor lighting conditions stems from the reliance on pixel-level metrics. In contrast, metric-agnostic, non-pixel-level object detection serves as a bridge between pixel-level and object-level spaces, enabling effective propagation and utilization of object map information within the system. Night-Voyager begins with a fast initialization to solve the global localization problem. By employing an effective two-stage cross-modal data association, the system delivers globally consistent state updates using map-based observations. To address the challenge of significant uncertainties in visual observations at night, a novel matrix Lie group formulation and a feature-decoupled multi-state invariant filter are introduced, ensuring consistent and efficient estimation. Through comprehensive experiments in both simulation and diverse real-world scenarios (spanning approximately 12.3 km), Night-Voyager showcases its efficacy, robustness, and efficiency, filling a critical gap in nocturnal vision-aided state estimation.

Title: DGFM: Full Body Dance Generation Driven by Music Foundation Models
Authors: Xinran Liu, Zhenhua Feng, Diptesh Kanojia, Wenwu Wang
Abstract: In music-driven dance motion generation, most existing methods use hand-crafted features and neglect that music foundation models have profoundly impacted cross-modal content generation. To bridge this gap, we propose a diffusion-based method that generates dance movements conditioned on text and music. Our approach extracts music features by combining high-level features obtained by music foundation model with hand-crafted features, thereby enhancing the quality of generated dance sequences. This method effectively leverages the advantages of high-level semantic information and low-level temporal details to improve the model's capability in music feature understanding. To show the merits of the proposed method, we compare it with four music foundation models and two sets of hand-crafted music features. The results demonstrate that our method obtains the most realistic dance sequences and achieves the best match with the input music.

Title: Pricing for Routing and Flow-Control in Payment Channel Networks
Authors: Suryanarayana Sankagiri, Bruce Hajek
Abstract: A payment channel network is a blockchain-based overlay mechanism that allows parties to transact more efficiently than directly using the blockchain. These networks are composed of payment channels that carry transactions between pairs of users. Due to its design, a payment channel cannot sustain a net flow of money in either direction indefinitely. Therefore, a payment channel network cannot serve transaction requests arbitrarily over a long period of time. We introduce \emph{DEBT control}, a joint routing and flow-control protocol that guides a payment channel network towards an optimal operating state for any steady-state demand. In this protocol, each channel sets a price for routing transactions through it. Transacting users make flow-control and routing decisions by responding to these prices. A channel updates its price based on the net flow of money through it. The protocol is developed by formulating a network utility maximization problem and solving its dual through gradient descent. We provide convergence guarantees for the protocol and also illustrate its behavior through simulations.

Title: DIN-CTS: Low-Complexity Depthwise-Inception Neural Network with Contrastive Training Strategy for Deepfake Speech Detection
Authors: Lam Pham, Dat Tran, Florian Skopik, Alexander Schindler, Silvia Poletti, Fischinger David, Martin Boyer
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a deep neural network approach for deepfake speech detection (DSD) based on a lowcomplexity Depthwise-Inception Network (DIN) trained with a contrastive training strategy (CTS). In this framework, input audio recordings are first transformed into spectrograms using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Linear Filter (LF), which are then used to train the DIN. Once trained, the DIN processes bonafide utterances to extract audio embeddings, which are used to construct a Gaussian distribution representing genuine speech. Deepfake detection is then performed by computing the distance between a test utterance and this distribution to determine whether the utterance is fake or bonafide. To evaluate our proposed systems, we conducted extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset of ASVspoof 2019 LA. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining the Depthwise-Inception Network with the contrastive learning strategy in distinguishing between fake and bonafide utterances. We achieved Equal Error Rate (EER), Accuracy (Acc.), F1, AUC scores of 4.6%, 95.4%, 97.3%, and 98.9% respectively using a single, low-complexity DIN with just 1.77 M parameters and 985 M FLOPS on short audio segments (4 seconds). Furthermore, our proposed system outperforms the single-system submissions in the ASVspoof 2019 LA challenge, showcasing its potential for real-time applications.

Title: Adapting Automatic Speech Recognition for Accented Air Traffic Control Communications
Authors: Marcus Yu Zhe Wee, Justin Juin Hng Wong, Lynus Lim, Joe Yu Wei Tan, Prannaya Gupta, Dillion Lim, En Hao Tew, Aloysius Keng Siew Han, Yong Zhi Lim
Abstract: Effective communication in Air Traffic Control (ATC) is critical to maintaining aviation safety, yet the challenges posed by accented English remain largely unaddressed in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. Existing models struggle with transcription accuracy for Southeast Asian-accented (SEA-accented) speech, particularly in noisy ATC environments. This study presents the development of ASR models fine-tuned specifically for Southeast Asian accents using a newly created dataset. Our research achieves significant improvements, achieving a Word Error Rate (WER) of 0.0982 or 9.82% on SEA-accented ATC speech. Additionally, the paper highlights the importance of region-specific datasets and accent-focused training, offering a pathway for deploying ASR systems in resource-constrained military operations. The findings emphasize the need for noise-robust training techniques and region-specific datasets to improve transcription accuracy for non-Western accents in ATC communications.

Title: ACCORD: Application Context-aware Cross-layer Optimization and Resource Design for 5G/NextG Machine-centric Applications
Authors: Azuka Chiejina, Subhramoy Mohanti, Vijay K. Shah
Abstract: Recent advancements in AI and edge computing have accelerated the development of machine-centric applications (MCAs), such as smart surveillance systems. In these applications, video cameras and sensors offload inference tasks like license plate recognition and vehicle tracking to remote servers due to local computing and energy constraints. However, legacy network solutions, designed primarily for human-centric applications, struggle to reliably support these MCAs, which demand heterogeneous and fluctuating QoS (due to diverse application inference tasks), further challenged by dynamic wireless network conditions and limited spectrum resources. To tackle these challenges, we propose an Application Context-aware Cross-layer Optimization and Resource Design (ACCORD) framework. This innovative framework anticipates the evolving demands of MCAs in real time, quickly adapting to provide customized QoS and optimal performance, even for the most dynamic and unpredictable MCAs. This also leads to improved network resource management and spectrum utilization. ACCORD operates as a closed feedback-loop system between the application client and network and consists of two key components: (1) Building Application Context: It focuses on understanding the specific context of MCA requirements. Contextual factors include device capabilities, user behavior (e.g., mobility speed), and network channel conditions. (2) Cross-layer Network Parameter Configuration: Utilizing a DRL approach, this component leverages the contextual information to optimize network configuration parameters across various layers, including PHY, MAC, and RLC, as well as the application layer, to meet the desired QoS requirement in real-time. Extensive evaluation with the 3GPP-compliant MATLAB 5G toolbox demonstrates the practicality and effectiveness of our proposed ACCORD framework.

Title: On Adversarial Attacks In Acoustic Drone Localization
Authors: Tamir Shor, Chaim Baskin, Alex Bronstein
Abstract: Multi-rotor aerial autonomous vehicles (MAVs, more widely known as "drones") have been generating increased interest in recent years due to their growing applicability in a vast and diverse range of fields (e.g., agriculture, commercial delivery, search and rescue). The sensitivity of visual-based methods to lighting conditions and occlusions had prompted growing study of navigation reliant on other modalities, such as acoustic sensing. A major concern in using drones in scale for tasks in non-controlled environments is the potential threat of adversarial attacks over their navigational systems, exposing users to mission-critical failures, security breaches, and compromised safety outcomes that can endanger operators and bystanders. While previous work shows impressive progress in acoustic-based drone localization, prior research in adversarial attacks over drone navigation only addresses visual sensing-based systems. In this work, we aim to compensate for this gap by supplying a comprehensive analysis of the effect of PGD adversarial attacks over acoustic drone localization. We furthermore develop an algorithm for adversarial perturbation recovery, capable of markedly diminishing the affect of such attacks in our setting. The code for reproducing all experiments will be released upon publication.

Title: Physics-Driven Data Generation for Contact-Rich Manipulation via Trajectory Optimization
Authors: Lujie Yang, H.J. Terry Suh, Tong Zhao, Bernhard Paus Graesdal, Tarik Kelestemur, Jiuguang Wang, Tao Pang, Russ Tedrake
Abstract: We present a low-cost data generation pipeline that integrates physics-based simulation, human demonstrations, and model-based planning to efficiently generate large-scale, high-quality datasets for contact-rich robotic manipulation tasks. Starting with a small number of embodiment-flexible human demonstrations collected in a virtual reality simulation environment, the pipeline refines these demonstrations using optimization-based kinematic retargeting and trajectory optimization to adapt them across various robot embodiments and physical parameters. This process yields a diverse, physically consistent dataset that enables cross-embodiment data transfer, and offers the potential to reuse legacy datasets collected under different hardware configurations or physical parameters. We validate the pipeline's effectiveness by training diffusion policies from the generated datasets for challenging contact-rich manipulation tasks across multiple robot embodiments, including a floating Allegro hand and bimanual robot arms. The trained policies are deployed zero-shot on hardware for bimanual iiwa arms, achieving high success rates with minimal human input. Project website: this https URL.

Title: Sim-to-Real Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Based Dexterous Manipulation on Humanoids
Authors: Toru Lin, Kartik Sachdev, Linxi Fan, Jitendra Malik, Yuke Zhu
Abstract: Reinforcement learning has delivered promising results in achieving human- or even superhuman-level capabilities across diverse problem domains, but success in dexterous robot manipulation remains limited. This work investigates the key challenges in applying reinforcement learning to solve a collection of contact-rich manipulation tasks on a humanoid embodiment. We introduce novel techniques to overcome the identified challenges with empirical validation. Our main contributions include an automated real-to-sim tuning module that brings the simulated environment closer to the real world, a generalized reward design scheme that simplifies reward engineering for long-horizon contact-rich manipulation tasks, a divide-and-conquer distillation process that improves the sample efficiency of hard-exploration problems while maintaining sim-to-real performance, and a mixture of sparse and dense object representations to bridge the sim-to-real perception gap. We show promising results on three humanoid dexterous manipulation tasks, with ablation studies on each technique. Our work presents a successful approach to learning humanoid dexterous manipulation using sim-to-real reinforcement learning, achieving robust generalization and high performance without the need for human demonstration.

Title: Fast Low Rank column-wise Compressive Sensing for Accelerated Dynamic MRI
Authors: Silpa Babu, Sajan Goud Lingala, Namrata Vaswani
Abstract: This work develops a fast, memory-efficient, and general algorithm for accelerated/undersampled dynamic MRI by assuming an approximate LR model on the matrix formed by the vectorized images of the sequence. By general, we mean that our algorithm can be used for multiple accelerated dynamic MRI applications and multiple sampling rates (acceleration rates) and patterns with a single choice of parameters (no parameter tuning). We show that our proposed algorithms, alternating Gradient Descent (GD) and minimization for MRI (altGDmin-MRI and altGDmin-MRI2), outperform many existing approaches while also being faster than all of them, on average. This claim is based on comparisons on 8 different retrospectively undersampled single- or multi-coil dynamic MRI applications, undersampled using either 1D Cartesian or 2D pseudo-radial undersampling at multiple sampling rates. All comparisons used the same set of algorithm parameters. Our second contribution is a mini-batch and a fully online extension that can process new measurements and return reconstructions either as soon as measurements of a new image frame arrive, or after a short delay.

Title: Enhancing Optimal Microgrid Planning with Adaptive BESS Degradation Costs and PV Asset Management: An Iterative Post-Optimization Correction Framework
Authors: Hassan Zahid Butt, Xingpeng Li
Abstract: The transition to renewable energy has positioned photovoltaic (PV) systems and battery energy storage systems (BESS) as essential assets in microgrids, particularly for remote installations. However, traditional planning models often neglect dynamic degradation costs or rely on complex or non-linear approaches, limiting their scalability and practical applicability. This paper introduces a microgrid planning model that integrates adaptive degradation cost modeling to enable accurate, efficient, and scalable long-term resource allocation. The proposed model employs the iterative post-optimization correction (IPOC) framework, solving a sequence of mixed-integer linear programming problems. Each iteration refines BESS degradation costs based on observed depth-of-discharge profiles and incorporates PV degradation costs to ensure realistic asset performance assessments. Sensitivity analysis of PV and BESS capital costs further underscores the model's robustness under varying economic conditions, with the IPOC framework achieving up to ~1% additional cost savings for the given test system compared to static approaches. The results demonstrate that by iteratively adjusting degradation penalties based on actual usage, the methodology optimizes BESS performance, ensures precise resource allocation, resolves issues of under- or overutilization, enhances system reliability, and facilitates scalable, sustainable microgrid planning.

Title: A Systematic Review of Low-Rank and Local Low-Rank Matrix Approximation in Big Data Medical Imaging
Authors: Sisipho Hamlomo, Marcellin Atemkeng, Yusuf Brima, Chuneeta Nunhokee, Jeremy Baxter
Abstract: The large volume and complexity of medical imaging datasets are bottlenecks for storage, transmission, and processing. To tackle these challenges, the application of low-rank matrix approximation (LRMA) and its derivative, local LRMA (LLRMA) has demonstrated potential. A detailed analysis of the literature identifies LRMA and LLRMA methods applied to various imaging modalities, and the challenges and limitations associated with existing LRMA and LLRMA methods are addressed. We note a significant shift towards a preference for LLRMA in the medical imaging field since 2015, demonstrating its potential and effectiveness in capturing complex structures in medical data compared to LRMA. Acknowledging the limitations of shallow similarity methods used with LLRMA, we suggest advanced semantic image segmentation for similarity measure, explaining in detail how it can be used to measure similar patches and its feasibility. We note that LRMA and LLRMA are mainly applied to unstructured medical data, and we propose extending their application to different medical data types, including structured and semi-structured. This paper also discusses how LRMA and LLRMA can be applied to regular data with missing entries and the impact of inaccuracies in predicting missing values and their effects. We discuss the impact of patch size and propose the use of random search (RS) to determine the optimal patch size. To enhance feasibility, a hybrid approach using Bayesian optimization and RS is proposed, which could improve the application of LRMA and LLRMA in medical imaging.

Title: Are Medium-Sized Transformers Models still Relevant for Medical Records Processing?
Authors: Boammani Aser Lompo, Thanh-Dung Le, Philippe Jouvet, Rita Noumeir
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become the standard in many NLP applications, we explore the potential of medium-sized pretrained transformer models as a viable alternative for medical record processing. Medical records generated by healthcare professionals during patient admissions remain underutilized due to challenges such as complex medical terminology, the limited ability of pretrained models to interpret numerical data, and the scarcity of annotated training datasets. Objective: This study aims to classify numerical values extracted from medical records into seven distinct physiological categories using CamemBERT-bio. Previous research has suggested that transformer-based models may underperform compared to traditional NLP approaches in this context. Methods: To enhance the performance of CamemBERT-bio, we propose two key innovations: (1) incorporating keyword embeddings to refine the model's attention mechanisms and (2) adopting a number-agnostic strategy by removing numerical values from the text to encourage context-driven learning. Additionally, we assess the criticality of extracted numerical data by verifying whether values fall within established standard ranges. Results: Our findings demonstrate significant performance improvements, with CamemBERT-bio achieving an F1 score of 0.89 - an increase of over 20% compared to the 0.73 F1 score of traditional methods and only 0.06 units lower than GPT-4. These results were obtained despite the use of small and imbalanced training datasets.

Title: Machine Learning for Fairness-Aware Load Shedding: A Real-Time Solution via Identifying Binding Constraints
Authors: Yuqi Zhou, Joseph Severino, Sanjana Vijayshankar, Juliette Ugirumurera, Jibo Sanyal
Abstract: Timely and effective load shedding in power systems is critical for maintaining supply-demand balance and preventing cascading blackouts. To eliminate load shedding bias against specific regions in the system, optimization-based methods are uniquely positioned to help balance between economic and fairness considerations. However, the resulting optimization problem involves complex constraints, which can be time-consuming to solve and thus cannot meet the real-time requirements of load shedding. To tackle this challenge, in this paper we present an efficient machine learning algorithm to enable millisecond-level computation for the optimization-based load shedding problem. Numerical studies on both a 3-bus toy example and a realistic RTS-GMLC system have demonstrated the validity and efficiency of the proposed algorithm for delivering fairness-aware and real-time load shedding decisions.

Title: Learned Image Transmission with Hierarchical Variational Autoencoder
Authors: Guangyi Zhang, Hanlei Li, Yunlong Cai, Qiyu Hu, Guanding Yu, Runmin Zhang
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an innovative hierarchical joint source-channel coding (HJSCC) framework for image transmission, utilizing a hierarchical variational autoencoder (VAE). Our approach leverages a combination of bottom-up and top-down paths at the transmitter to autoregressively generate multiple hierarchical representations of the original image. These representations are then directly mapped to channel symbols for transmission by the JSCC encoder. We extend this framework to scenarios with a feedback link, modeling transmission over a noisy channel as a probabilistic sampling process and deriving a novel generative formulation for JSCC with feedback. Compared with existing approaches, our proposed HJSCC provides enhanced adaptability by dynamically adjusting transmission bandwidth, encoding these representations into varying amounts of channel symbols. Extensive experiments on images of varying resolutions demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms existing baselines in rate-distortion performance and maintains robustness against channel noise. The source code will be made available upon acceptance.

Title: The Role of Explainable AI in Revolutionizing Human Health Monitoring: A Review
Authors: Abdullah Alharthi, Ahmed Alqurashi, Turki Alharbi, Mohammed Alammar, Nasser Aldosari, Houssem Bouchekara, Yusuf Shaaban, Mohammad Shoaib Shahriar, Abdulrahman Al Ayidh
Abstract: The complex nature of disease mechanisms and the variability of patient symptoms pose significant challenges in developing effective diagnostic tools. Although machine learning (ML) has made substantial advances in medical diagnosis, the decision-making processes of these models often lack transparency, potentially jeopardizing patient outcomes. This review aims to highlight the role of Explainable AI (XAI) in addressing the interpretability issues of ML models in healthcare, with a focus on chronic conditions such as Parkinson's, stroke, depression, cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's disease. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases to identify studies that applied XAI techniques in healthcare. The search focused on XAI algorithms used in diagnosing and monitoring chronic diseases. The review identified the application of nine trending XAI algorithms, each evaluated for their advantages and limitations in various healthcare contexts. The findings underscore the importance of transparency in ML models, which is crucial for improving trust and outcomes in clinical practice. While XAI provides significant potential to bridge the gap between complex ML models and clinical practice, challenges such as scalability, validation, and clinician acceptance remain. The review also highlights areas requiring further research, particularly in integrating XAI into healthcare systems. The study concludes that XAI methods offer a promising path forward for enhancing human health monitoring and patient care, though significant challenges must be addressed to fully realize their potential in clinical settings.

Title: Gaming on Coincident Peak Shaving: Equilibrium and Strategic Behavior
Authors: Liudong Chen, Jay Sethuraman, Bolun Xu
Abstract: Power system operators and electric utility companies often charge consumers a peak demand charge when the aggregate system demand reaches its maximum, a practice known as coincident peak shaving. These charges incentivize consumers to reduce usage during critical periods, alleviating stress on electricity transmission and distribution systems, while also helping to recover the grid investment costs. In this paper, we analyze the problem through the lens of game theory, developing a model that captures how strategic consumer behavior influences overall system efficiency. Our results reveal that the coincident peak shaving game can be concave, quasiconcave with discontinuities, or non-concave with discontinuities, depending on the extent of consumers' demand-shifting capabilities. In a two-agent, two-period framework, we derive closed-form Nash equilibrium solutions for each scenario and extend our analysis to multi-agent settings. We prove the stability of these equilibrium points and propose an algorithm to compute equilibrium outcomes across all game configurations. Furthermore, we show that while the decentralized game model achieves peak-shaving performance comparable to a centralized approach, it does so at the cost of increased anarchy. In scenarios characterized by quasi-concave and non-concave conditions, our analytical results demonstrate that anarchy grows with greater consumer flexibility and disparities in marginal shifting costs, and we explore how the number of agents affects system efficiency. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to validate our theoretical findings.

Title: Generalized and Efficient 2D Gaussian Splatting for Arbitrary-scale Super-Resolution
Authors: Du Chen, Liyi Chen, Zhengqiang Zhang, Lei Zhang
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has been successfully employed for Arbitrary-scale Super-Resolution (ASR). However, INR-based models need to query the multi-layer perceptron module numerous times and render a pixel in each query, resulting in insufficient representation capability and computational efficiency. Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown its advantages over INR in both visual quality and rendering speed in 3D tasks, which motivates us to explore whether GS can be employed for the ASR task. However, directly applying GS to ASR is exceptionally challenging because the original GS is an optimization-based method through overfitting each single scene, while in ASR we aim to learn a single model that can generalize to different images and scaling factors. We overcome these challenges by developing two novel techniques. Firstly, to generalize GS for ASR, we elaborately design an architecture to predict the corresponding image-conditioned Gaussians of the input low-resolution image in a feed-forward manner. Each Gaussian can fit the shape and direction of an area of complex textures, showing powerful representation capability. Secondly, we implement an efficient differentiable 2D GPU/CUDA-based scale-aware rasterization to render super-resolved images by sampling discrete RGB values from the predicted continuous Gaussians. Via end-to-end training, our optimized network, namely GSASR, can perform ASR for any image and unseen scaling factors. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code and models will be released.

Title: Diagnosing COVID-19 Severity from Chest X-Ray Images Using ViT and CNN Architectures
Authors: Luis Lara, Lucia Eve Berger, Rajesh Raju
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic strained healthcare resources and prompted discussion about how machine learning can alleviate physician burdens and contribute to diagnosis. Chest x-rays (CXRs) are used for diagnosis of COVID-19, but few studies predict the severity of a patient's condition from CXRs. In this study, we produce a large COVID severity dataset by merging three sources and investigate the efficacy of transfer learning using ImageNet- and CXR-pretrained models and vision transformers (ViTs) in both severity regression and classification tasks. A pretrained DenseNet161 model performed the best on the three class severity prediction problem, reaching 80% accuracy overall and 77.3%, 83.9%, and 70% on mild, moderate and severe cases, respectively. The ViT had the best regression results, with a mean absolute error of 0.5676 compared to radiologist-predicted severity scores. The project's source code is publicly available.

Title: MC2SleepNet: Multi-modal Cross-masking with Contrastive Learning for Sleep Stage Classification
Authors: Younghoon Na, Hyun Keun Ahn, Hyun-Kyung Lee, Yoongeol Lee, Seung Hun Oh, Hongkwon Kim, Jeong-Gun Lee
Abstract: Sleep profoundly affects our health, and sleep deficiency or disorders can cause physical and mental problems. Despite significant findings from previous studies, challenges persist in optimizing deep learning models, especially in multi-modal learning for high-accuracy sleep stage classification. Our research introduces MC2SleepNet (Multi-modal Cross-masking with Contrastive learning for Sleep stage classification Network). It aims to facilitate the effective collaboration between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer architectures for multi-modal training with the help of contrastive learning and cross-masking. Raw single channel EEG signals and corresponding spectrogram data provide differently characterized modalities for multi-modal learning. Our MC2SleepNet has achieved state-of-the-art performance with an accuracy of both 84.6% on the SleepEDF-78 and 88.6% accuracy on the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). These results demonstrate the effective generalization of our proposed network across both small and large datasets.

Title: Multi-View Contrastive Network (MVCNet) for Motor Imagery Classification
Authors: Ziwei Wang, Siyang Li, Xiaoqing Chen, Wei Li, Dongrui Wu
Abstract: Objective: An electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) serves as a direct communication pathway between the human brain and an external device. While supervised learning has been extensively explored for motor imagery (MI) EEG classification, small data quantity has been a key factor limiting the performance of deep feature learning. Methods: This paper proposes a knowledge-driven time-space-frequency based multi-view contrastive network (MVCNet) for MI EEG decoding in BCIs. MVCNet integrates knowledge from the time, space, and frequency domains into the training process through data augmentations from multiple views, fostering more discriminative feature learning of the characteristics of EEG data. We introduce a cross-view contrasting module to learn from different augmented views and a cross-model contrasting module to enhance the consistency of features extracted between knowledge-guided and data-driven models. Results: The combination of EEG data augmentation strategies was systematically investigated for more informative supervised contrastive learning. Experiments on four public MI datasets and three different architectures demonstrated that MVCNet outperformed 10 existing approaches. Significance: Our approach can significantly boost EEG classification performance beyond designated networks, showcasing the potential to enhance the feature learning process for better EEG decoding.

Title: RetinaRegen: A Hybrid Model for Readability and Detail Restoration in Fundus Images
Authors: Yuhan Tang, Yudian Wang, Weizhen Li, Ye Yue, Chengchang Pan, Honggang Qi
Abstract: Fundus image quality is crucial for diagnosing eye diseases, but real-world conditions often result in blurred or unreadable images, increasing diagnostic uncertainty. To address these challenges, this study proposes RetinaRegen, a hybrid model for retinal image restoration that integrates a readability classifi-cation model, a Diffusion Model, and a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Ex-periments on the SynFundus-1M dataset show that the proposed method achieves a PSNR of 27.4521, an SSIM of 0.9556, and an LPIPS of 0.1911 for the readability labels of the optic disc (RO) region. These results demonstrate superior performance in restoring key regions, offering an effective solution to enhance fundus image quality and support clinical diagnosis.

Title: Few Shot Alternating GD and Minimization for Generalizable Real-Time MRI
Authors: Silpa Babu, Sajan Goud Lingala, Namrata Vaswani
Abstract: This work introduces a novel near real-time (real-time after an initial short delay) MRI solution that handles motion well and is generalizable. Here, real-time means the algorithm works well on a highly accelerated scan, is zero-latency (reconstructs a new frame as soon as MRI data for it arrives), and is fast enough, i.e., the time taken to process a frame is comparable to the scan time per frame or lesser. We demonstrate its generalizability through experiments on 6 prospective datasets and 17 retrospective datasets that span multiple different applications -- speech larynx imaging, brain, ungated cardiac perfusion, cardiac cine, cardiac OCMR, abdomen; sampling schemes -- Cartesian, pseudo-radial, radial, spiral; and sampling rates -- ranging from 6x to 4 radial lines per frame. Comparisons with a large number of existing real-time and batch methods, including unsupervised and supervised deep learning methods, show the power and speed of our approach.

Title: Localized and Distributed Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces with Lossy Interconnections: Modeling and Optimization
Authors: Matteo Nerini, Golsa Ghiaasi, Bruno Clerckx
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a key technology to control the communication environment in future wireless networks. Recently, beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) emerged as a generalization of RIS achieving larger coverage through additional tunable impedance components interconnecting the RIS elements. However, conventional RIS and BD-RIS can effectively serve only users in their proximity, resulting in limited coverage. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we investigate distributed RIS, whose elements are distributed over a wide region, in opposition to localized RIS commonly considered in the literature. The scaling laws of distributed BD-RIS reveal that it offers significant gains over distributed conventional RIS and localized BD-RIS, enabled by its interconnections allowing signal propagation within the BD-RIS. To assess the practical performance of distributed BD-RIS, we model and optimize BD-RIS with lossy interconnections through transmission line theory. Our model accounts for phase changes and losses over the BD-RIS interconnections arising when the interconnection lengths are not much smaller than the wavelength. Numerical results show that the performance of localized BD-RIS is only slightly impacted by losses, given the short interconnection lengths. Besides, distributed BD-RIS can achieve orders of magnitude of gains over conventional RIS, even in the presence of low losses.

Title: Deep Incremental Model Informed Reinforcement Learning for Continuous Robotic Control
Authors: Cong Li
Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning attempts to use an available or learned model to improve the data efficiency of reinforcement learning. This work proposes a one-step lookback approach that jointly learns the deep incremental model and the policy to realize the sample-efficient continuous robotic control, wherein the control-theoretical knowledge is utilized to decrease the model learning difficulty and facilitate efficient training. Specifically, we use one-step backward data to facilitate the deep incremental model, an alternative structured representation of the robotic evolution model, that accurately predicts the robotic movement but with low sample complexity. This is because the formulated deep incremental model degrades the model learning difficulty into a parametric matrix learning problem, which is especially favourable to high-dimensional robotic applications. The imagined data from the learned deep incremental model is used to supplement training data to enhance the sample efficiency. Comparative numerical simulations on benchmark continuous robotics control problems are conducted to validate the efficiency of our proposed one-step lookback approach.

Title: An Effective Automated Speaking Assessment Approach to Mitigating Data Scarcity and Imbalanced Distribution
Authors: Tien-Hong Lo, Fu-An Chao, Tzu-I Wu, Yao-Ting Sung, Berlin Chen
Abstract: Automated speaking assessment (ASA) typically involves automatic speech recognition (ASR) and hand-crafted feature extraction from the ASR transcript of a learner's speech. Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown stellar performance compared to traditional methods. However, SSL-based ASA systems are faced with at least three data-related challenges: limited annotated data, uneven distribution of learner proficiency levels and non-uniform score intervals between different CEFR proficiency levels. To address these challenges, we explore the use of two novel modeling strategies: metric-based classification and loss reweighting, leveraging distinct SSL-based embedding features. Extensive experimental results on the ICNALE benchmark dataset suggest that our approach can outperform existing strong baselines by a sizable margin, achieving a significant improvement of more than 10% in CEFR prediction accuracy.

Title: Neural Configuration Distance Function for Continuum Robot Control
Authors: Kehan Long, Hardik Parwana, Georgios Fainekos, Bardh Hoxha, Hideki Okamoto, Nikolay Atanasov
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for modeling the shape of a continuum robot as a Neural Configuration Euclidean Distance Function (N-CEDF). By learning separate distance fields for each link and combining them through the kinematics chain, the learned N-CEDF provides an accurate and computationally efficient representation of the robot's shape. The key advantage of a distance function representation of a continuum robot is that it enables efficient collision checking for motion planning in dynamic and cluttered environments, even with point-cloud observations. We integrate the N-CEDF into a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller to generate safe trajectories for multi-segment continuum robots. The proposed approach is validated for continuum robots with various links in several simulated environments with static and dynamic obstacles.

Title: Optimization Proxies using Limited Labeled Data and Training Time -- A Semi-Supervised Bayesian Neural Network Approach
Authors: Parikshit Pareek, Abhijith Jayakumar, Kaarthik Sundar, Deepjyoti Deka, Sidhant Misra
Abstract: Constrained optimization problems arise in various engineering systems such as inventory management and power grids. Standard deep neural network (DNN) based machine learning proxies are ineffective in practical settings where labeled data is scarce and training times are limited. We propose a semi-supervised Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) based optimization proxy for this complex regime, wherein training commences in a sandwiched fashion, alternating between a supervised learning step for minimizing cost, and an unsupervised learning step for enforcing constraint feasibility. We show that the proposed semi-supervised BNN outperforms DNN architectures on important non-convex constrained optimization problems from energy network operations, achieving up to a tenfold reduction in expected maximum equality gap and halving the inequality gaps. Further, the BNN's ability to provide posterior samples is leveraged to construct practically meaningful probabilistic confidence bounds on performance using a limited validation data, unlike prior methods.

Abstract: The escalating demands of compute-intensive applications urgently necessitate the adoption of optical interconnect technologies to overcome bottlenecks in scaling computing systems. This requires fully exploiting the inherent parallelism of light across scalable dimensions for data loading. Here we experimentally demonstrate a synergy of wavelength- and mode- multiplexing combined with high-order modulation formats to achieve multi-tens-of-terabits-per-second optical interconnects using foundry-compatible silicon photonic circuits. Implementing an edge-guided analog-and-digital optimization method that integrates high efficiency with fabrication robustness, we achieve the inverse design of mode multiplexers based on digital metamaterial waveguides. Furthermore, we employ a packaged five-mode multiplexing chip, achieving a single-wavelength interconnect capacity of 1.62 Tbit s-1 and a record-setting multi-dimensional interconnect capacity of 38.2 Tbit s-1 across 5 modes and 88 wavelength channels, with high-order formats up to 8-ary pulse-amplitude-modulation (PAM). This study highlights the transformative potential of optical interconnect technologies to surmount the constraints of electronic links, thus setting the stage for next-generation datacenter and optical compute interconnects.

Title: Modeling and Optimization for Rotatable Antenna Enabled Wireless Communication
Authors: Qingjie Wu, Beixiong Zheng, Tiantian Ma, Rui Zhang
Abstract: Fluid antenna system (FAS)/movable antenna (MA) has emerged as a promising technology to fully exploit the spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). In this paper, we propose a new rotatable antenna (RA) model, as a simplified implementation of six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA), to improve the performance of wireless communication systems. Different from conventional fixed antenna, the proposed RA system can independently and flexibly change the three-dimensional (3D) orientation/boresight of each antenna by adjusting its deflection angles to achieve desired channel realizations. Specifically, we study an RA-enabled uplink communication system, where the receive beamforming and the deflection angles of all RAs are jointly optimized to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all the users. In the special single-user and free-space propagation setup, the optimal deflection angles are derived in closed form with the maximum-ratio combining (MRC) beamformer applied at the base station (BS). In the general multi-user and multi-path setup, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to alternately optimize the receive beamforming and the deflection angles in an iterative manner. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed RA-enabled system can significantly outperform other benchmark schemes.

Title: G3Flow: Generative 3D Semantic Flow for Pose-aware and Generalizable Object Manipulation

Abstract: Recent advances in imitation learning for 3D robotic manipulation have shown promising results with diffusion-based policies. However, achieving human-level dexterity requires seamless integration of geometric precision and semantic understanding. We present G3Flow, a novel framework that constructs real-time semantic flow, a dynamic, object-centric 3D semantic representation by leveraging foundation models. Our approach uniquely combines 3D generative models for digital twin creation, vision foundation models for semantic feature extraction, and robust pose tracking for continuous semantic flow updates. This integration enables complete semantic understanding even under occlusions while eliminating manual annotation requirements. By incorporating semantic flow into diffusion policies, we demonstrate significant improvements in both terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization. Extensive experiments across five simulation tasks show that G3Flow consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 68.3% and 50.1% average success rates on terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization tasks respectively. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of G3Flow in enhancing real-time dynamic semantic feature understanding for robotic manipulation policies.

Title: Dual-Polarized Beyond Diagonal RIS
Authors: Matteo Nerini, Bruno Clerckx
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) is a family of RIS architectures more flexible than conventional RIS. While BD-RIS has been primarily analyzed assuming uni-polarized systems, modern wireless deployments are dual-polarized. To address this gap, this paper investigates the fundamental limits of dual-polarized BD-RIS-aided systems. We derive the scaling laws governing the performance of BD-RIS and the Pareto frontier of the trade-off between performance and circuit complexity enabled by BD-RIS. Theoretical results show that the group-connected RIS with group size 2 provides remarkable gains over conventional RIS in both Rayleigh and line-of-sight (LoS) channels, while maintaining a reduced circuit complexity.

Title: Detection Augmented Bandit Procedures for Piecewise Stationary MABs: A Modular Approach
Authors: Yu-Han Huang, Argyrios Gerogiannis, Subhonmesh Bose, Venugopal V. Veeravalli
Abstract: Conventional Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms are designed for stationary environments, where the reward distributions associated with the arms do not change with time. In many applications, however, the environment is more accurately modeled as being nonstationary. In this work, piecewise stationary MAB (PS-MAB) environments are investigated, in which the reward distributions associated with a subset of the arms change at some change-points and remain stationary between change-points. Our focus is on the asymptotic analysis of PS-MABs, for which practical algorithms based on change detection (CD) have been previously proposed. Our goal is to modularize the design and analysis of such CD-based Bandit (CDB) procedures. To this end, we identify the requirements for stationary bandit algorithms and change detectors in a CDB procedure that are needed for the modularization. We assume that the rewards are sub-Gaussian. Under this assumption and a condition on the separation of the change-points, we show that the analysis of CDB procedures can indeed be modularized, so that regret bounds can be obtained in a unified manner for various combinations of change detectors and bandit algorithms. Through this analysis, we develop new modular CDB procedures that are order-optimal. We compare the performance of our modular CDB procedures with various other methods in simulations.

Title: NotaGen: Advancing Musicality in Symbolic Music Generation with Large Language Model Training Paradigms
Authors: Yashan Wang, Shangda Wu, Jianhuai Hu, Xingjian Du, Yueqi Peng, Yongxin Huang, Shuai Fan, Xiaobing Li, Feng Yu, Maosong Sun
Abstract: We introduce NotaGen, a symbolic music generation model aiming to explore the potential of producing high-quality classical sheet music. Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), NotaGen adopts pre-training, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning paradigms (henceforth referred to as the LLM training paradigms). It is pre-trained on 1.6M pieces of music, and then fine-tuned on approximately 9K high-quality classical compositions conditioned on "period-composer-instrumentation" prompts. For reinforcement learning, we propose the CLaMP-DPO method, which further enhances generation quality and controllability without requiring human annotations or predefined rewards. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of CLaMP-DPO in symbolic music generation models with different architectures and encoding schemes. Furthermore, subjective A/B tests show that NotaGen outperforms baseline models against human compositions, greatly advancing musical aesthetics in symbolic music generation.
