Title: LAYER: A Quantitative Explainable AI Framework for Decoding Tissue-Layer Drivers of Myofascial Low Back Pain
Authors: Zixue Zeng, Anthony M. Perti, Tong Yu, Grant Kokenberger, Hao-En Lu, Jing Wang, Xin Meng, Zhiyu Sheng, Maryam Satarpour, John M. Cormack, Allison C. Bean, Ryan P. Nussbaum, Emily Landis-Walkenhorst, Kang Kim, Ajay D. Wasan, Jiantao Pu
Abstract: Myofascial pain (MP) is a leading cause of chronic low back pain, yet its tissue-level drivers remain poorly defined and lack reliable image biomarkers. Existing studies focus predominantly on muscle while neglecting fascia, fat, and other soft tissues that play integral biomechanical roles. We developed an anatomically grounded explainable artificial intelligence (AI) framework, LAYER (Layer-wise Analysis for Yielding Explainable Relevance Tissue), that analyses six tissue layers in three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound and quantifies their contribution to MP prediction. By utilizing the largest multi-model 3D ultrasound cohort consisting of over 4,000 scans, LAYER reveals that non-muscle tissues contribute substantially to pain prediction. In B-mode imaging, the deep fascial membrane (DFM) showed the highest saliency (0.420), while in combined B-mode and shear-wave images, the collective saliency of non-muscle layers (0.316) nearly matches that of muscle (0.317), challenging the conventional muscle-centric paradigm in MP research and potentially affecting the therapy methods. LAYER establishes a quantitative, interpretable framework for linking layer-specific anatomy to pain physiology, uncovering new tissue targets and providing a generalizable approach for explainable analysis of soft-tissue imaging.

Title: Attention-Guided Fair AI Modeling for Skin Cancer Diagnosis
Authors: Mingcheng Zhu, Mingxuan Liu, Han Yuan, Yilin Ning, Zhiyao Luo, Tingting Zhu, Nan Liu
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown remarkable promise in dermatology, offering accurate and non-invasive diagnosis of skin cancer. While extensive research has addressed skin tone-related bias, gender bias in dermatologic AI remains underexplored, leading to unequal care and reinforcing existing gender disparities. In this study, we developed LesionAttn, a fairness-aware algorithm that integrates clinical knowledge into model design by directing attention toward lesion regions, mirroring the diagnostic focus of clinicians. Combined with Pareto-frontier optimization for dual-objective model selection, LesionAttn balances fairness and predictive accuracy. Validated on two large-scale dermatological datasets, LesionAttn significantly mitigates gender bias while maintaining high diagnostic performance, outperforming existing bias mitigation algorithms. Our study highlights the potential of embedding clinical knowledge into AI development to advance both model performance and fairness, and further to foster interdisciplinary collaboration between clinicians and AI developers.

Title: LILAD: Learning In-context Lyapunov-stable Adaptive Dynamics Models
Authors: Amit Jena, Na Li, Le Xie
Abstract: System identification in control theory aims to approximate dynamical systems from trajectory data. While neural networks have demonstrated strong predictive accuracy, they often fail to preserve critical physical properties such as stability and typically assume stationary dynamics, limiting their applicability under distribution shifts. Existing approaches generally address either stability or adaptability in isolation, lacking a unified framework that ensures both. We propose LILAD (Learning In-Context Lyapunov-stable Adaptive Dynamics), a novel framework for system identification that jointly guarantees adaptability and stability. LILAD simultaneously learns a dynamics model and a Lyapunov function through in-context learning (ICL), explicitly accounting for parametric uncertainty. Trained across a diverse set of tasks, LILAD produces a stability-aware, adaptive dynamics model alongside an adaptive Lyapunov certificate. At test time, both components adapt to a new system instance using a short trajectory prompt, which enables fast generalization. To rigorously ensure stability, LILAD also computes a state-dependent attenuator that enforces a sufficient decrease condition on the Lyapunov function for any state in the new system instance. This mechanism extends stability guarantees even under out-of-distribution and out-of-task scenarios. We evaluate LILAD on benchmark autonomous systems and demonstrate that it outperforms adaptive, robust, and non-adaptive baselines in predictive accuracy.

Title: Automated Enumeration of Reconfigurable Architectures for Thermal Management Systems in Battery Electric Vehicles
Authors: Reihaneh Jahedan, Satya Peddada, Mark Jennings, Sunil Katragadda, James Allison, Nenad Miljkovic
Abstract: As the automotive industry moves towards vehicle electrification, designing and optimizing thermal management systems (TMSs) for Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) has become a critical focus in recent years. The dependence of battery performance on operating temperature, the lack of waste combustion heat, and the significant effect of TMS energy consumption on driving range make the design of BEV TMSs highly complicated compared to conventional vehicles. Although prior research has focused on optimizing the configuration of thermal systems for varying ambient conditions, a holistic approach to studying the full potential of reconfigurable TMS architectures has not yet been fully explored. The complex design landscape of multi-mode reconfigurable systems is difficult to navigate. Relying solely on expert intuition and creativity to identify new architectures both restricts progress and leaves significant performance improvements unrealized. In this study, using graph modelling of TMS architectures, we propose a systematic method to automatically enumerate and simulate reconfigurable architectures for a TMS, given the desired operating modes, along with a framework to conduct transient performance analysis and optimization-based trade-off studies among system performance, energy consumption, and complexity. We explored more than 150 operating mode sequences, retaining 39 unique architectures for further evaluation. MATLAB Simscape models of these architectures were automatically created and their performance evaluated. The multi-objective optimization results provide decision support for selecting the best architecture based on user priorities.

Title: Internodal Distance Distributions for Static and Mobile Nodes in 2D/3D Wireless Networks
Authors: Nicholas Vaiopoulos, Alexander Vavoulas, Harilaos G. Sandalidis, Konstantinos K. Delibasis, Dimitris Varoutas
Abstract: This letter presents a unified analytical framework for internodal distance distributions in 2D and 3D wireless networks, with nodes confined to concentric circular or spherical regions. Four deployment scenarios are considered, covering all combinations of static (uniform) and mobile (random waypoint-based) nodes. For each scenario, closed-form expressions for the internodal distance probability density functions are derived, incorporating both geometric constraints and spatial effects introduced by mobility. Equal-radius cases are also addressed. Beta-distribution approximations and Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the accuracy and validity of the analytical results.

Title: Quantized Distributed Estimation with Event-triggered Communication and Packet Loss
Authors: Ying Wang, Yanlong Zhao, Ji-Feng Zhang, Karl Henrik Johansson
Abstract: This paper focuses on the problem of quantized distributed estimation with event-triggered communication and packet loss, aiming to reduce the number of transmitted bits. The main challenge lies in the inability to differentiate between an untriggered event and a packet loss occurrence. This paper proposes an event-triggered distributed estimation algorithm with quantized communication and quantized measurement, in which it introduces a one-bit information reconstruction method to deal with packet loss. The almost sure convergence and convergence rate of the proposed algorithm are this http URL, it is demonstrated that the global average communication bit-rate decreases to zero over time. Moreover, the trade-off between communication rate and convergence rate is revealed, providing guidance for designing the communication rate required to achieve the algorithm's convergence rate. A numerical example is supplied to validate the findings.

Title: Comparing SAM 2 and SAM 3 for Zero-Shot Segmentation of 3D Medical Data
Authors: Satrajit Chakrabarty, Ravi Soni
Abstract: Foundation models for promptable segmentation, including SAM, SAM 2, and the recently released SAM 3, have renewed interest in zero-shot segmentation of medical imaging. Although these models perform strongly on natural images, their behavior on medical data remains insufficiently characterized. While SAM 2 is widely used for annotation in 3D medical workflows, SAM 3 introduces a new perception backbone, detector-tracker pipeline, and concept-level prompting that may alter its behavior under spatial prompts. We present the first controlled comparison of SAM 2 and SAM 3 for zero-shot segmentation of 3D medical volumes and videos under purely visual prompting, with concept mechanisms disabled. We assess whether SAM 3 can serve as an out-of-the-box replacement for SAM 2 without customization. We benchmark both models on 16 public datasets (CT, MRI, 3D and cine ultrasound, endoscopy) covering 54 anatomical structures, pathologies, and surgical instruments. Prompts are restricted to the first frame and use four modes: single-click, multi-click, bounding box, and dense mask. This design standardizes preprocessing, prompt placement, propagation rules, and metric computation to disentangle prompt interpretation from propagation. Prompt-frame analysis shows that SAM 3 provides substantially stronger initialization than SAM 2 for click prompting across most structures. In full-volume analysis, SAM 3 retains this advantage for complex, vascular, and soft-tissue anatomies, emerging as the more versatile general-purpose segmenter. While SAM 2 remains competitive for compact, rigid organs under strong spatial guidance, it frequently fails on challenging targets where SAM 3 succeeds. Overall, our results suggest that SAM 3 is the superior default choice for most medical segmentation tasks, particularly those involving sparse user interaction or complex anatomical topology.

Title: Learning Neural Network Safe Tracking Controllers from Backward Reachable Sets
Authors: Yuezhu Xu, Mohamed Serry, Jun Liu, S. Sivaranjani
Abstract: The design of tracking controllers that closely follow a reference trajectory while ensuring safety and robustness against disturbances is a challenging problem in the control of autonomous systems. In this work, we propose a neural network-based safe tracking control framework for nonlinear discrete-time systems with reach-avoid specifications in the presence of disturbances. Our approach begins with generation of a nominal trajectory using standard trajectory synthesis approaches, followed by construction of safe zonotopic backward reachable sets along the nominal trajectory. The states lying within the backward reachable sets are guaranteed to satisfy safe reachability specifications. Then, our key insight is to leverage the computed backward reachable sets to inform the architecture and training of a neural network-based tracking controller such that the neural network drives the system's states through these backward reachable sets, thereby improving the likelihood of safe reachability. We perform formal verification with conformal prediction to achieve statistical safety guarantees on the performance of the learned neural controller. The performance of our approach is illustrated through a numerical example on the discrete-time Dubin's car model.

Title: Communication-Aware Dissipative Control for Networks of Heterogeneous Nonlinear Agents
Authors: Ingyu Jang, Leila J. Bridgeman
Abstract: Communication-aware control is essential to reduce costs and complexity in large-scale networks. However, it is challenging to simultaneously determine a sparse communication topology and achieve high performance and robustness. This work achieves all three objectives through dissipativity-based, sparsity-promoting controller synthesis. The approach identifies an optimal sparse structure using either weighted l1 penalties or alternating direction methods of multipliers (ADMM) with a cardinality term, and iteratively solves a convexified version of the NP hard structured optimal control problem. The proposed methods are demonstrated on heterogeneous networks with uncertain and unstable agents.

Title: Digital Elevation Model Estimation from RGB Satellite Imagery using Generative Deep Learning
Authors: Alif Ilham Madani, Riska A. Kuswati, Alex M. Lechner, Muhamad Risqi U. Saputra
Abstract: Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are vital datasets for geospatial applications such as hydrological modeling and environmental monitoring. However, conventional methods to generate DEM, such as using LiDAR and photogrammetry, require specific types of data that are often inaccessible in resource-constrained settings. To alleviate this problem, this study proposes an approach to generate DEM from freely available RGB satellite imagery using generative deep learning, particularly based on a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We first developed a global dataset consisting of 12K RGB-DEM pairs using Landsat satellite imagery and NASA's SRTM digital elevation data, both from the year 2000. A unique preprocessing pipeline was implemented to select high-quality, cloud-free regions and aggregate normalized RGB composites from Landsat imagery. Additionally, the model was trained in a two-stage process, where it was first trained on the complete dataset and then fine-tuned on high-quality samples filtered by Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) values to improve performance on challenging terrains. The results demonstrate promising performance in mountainous regions, achieving an overall mean root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.4671 and a mean SSIM score of 0.2065 (scale -1 to 1), while highlighting limitations in lowland and residential areas. This study underscores the importance of meticulous preprocessing and iterative refinement in generative modeling for DEM generation, offering a cost-effective and adaptive alternative to conventional methods while emphasizing the challenge of generalization across diverse terrains worldwide.

Title: Joint Estimation of Sea State and Vessel Parameters Using a Mass-Spring-Damper Equivalence Model
Authors: Ranjeet K. Tiwari, Daniel Sgarioto, Peter Graham, Alexei Skvortsov, Sanjeev Arulampalam, Damith C. Ranasinghe
Abstract: Real-time sea state estimation is vital for applications like shipbuilding and maritime safety. Traditional methods rely on accurate wave-vessel transfer functions to estimate wave spectra from onboard sensors. In contrast, our approach jointly estimates sea state and vessel parameters without needing prior transfer function knowledge, which may be unavailable or variable. We model the wave-vessel system using pseudo mass-spring-dampers and develop a dynamic model for the system. This method allows for recursive modeling of wave excitation as a time-varying input, relaxing prior works' assumption of a constant input. We derive statistically consistent process noise covariance and implement a square root cubature Kalman filter for sensor data fusion. Further, we derive the Posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound to evaluate estimator performance. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations and data from a high-fidelity validated simulator confirm that the estimated wave spectrum matches methods assuming complete transfer function knowledge.

Title: When Do Domain-Specific Foundation Models Justify Their Cost? A Systematic Evaluation Across Retinal Imaging Tasks
Authors: David Isztl, Tahm Spitznagel, Gabor Mark Somfai, Rui Santos
Abstract: Large vision foundation models have been widely adopted for retinal disease classification without systematic evidence justifying their parameter requirements. In the present work we address two critical questions: First, are large domain-specific foundation models essential, or do compact general-purpose architectures suffice? Second, does specialized retinal pretraining justify its computational cost? To answer this, we benchmark initialization strategies across four retinal imaging classification tasks spanning Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Color Fundus Photography (CFP) modalities: 8-class OCT classification, 3-class diabetic macular edema (DME), 5-class diabetic retinopathy (DR), and 3-class glaucoma (GL) detection. We evaluate 12-13 model configurations per task, including vision transformers (22.8M-86.6M parameters), Swin Transformers (27.6M-28.3M), ConvNeXt (28.6M), and the domain-specific RETFound models (303M), under identical training conditions. Our results challenge prevailing assumptions: First, we demonstrate that pretraining provides universal benefits (5.18-18.41% improvement), scaling with task difficulty. Second, compact architectures (27-29M) dominate Pareto frontiers; SwinV2-tiny achieves top-1 performance on three datasets. Third, RETFound (303M) justifies its computational cost only for challenging DR grading (accuracy of 71.15%), while ImageNet pretraining proves to be sufficient with all other tasks (DME accuracy: 99.24%, OCT accuracy: 97.96%). CFP tasks show larger pretraining accuracy gains (9.13-18.41%) than OCT (5.18%). Thus, the evidence suggests that compact general-purpose models deliver near-optimal performance for most retinal classification tasks; specialized foundation models warranted only for fine-grained discrimination under extreme class imbalance.

Title: Performance of the Kalman Filter and Smoother for Benchmark Studies
Authors: Batin Kurt, Umut Orguner
Abstract: We propose analytical mean square error (MSE) expressions for the Kalman filter (KF) and the Kalman smoother (KS) for benchmark studies, where the true system dynamics are unknown or unavailable to the estimator. In such cases, as in benchmark evaluations for target tracking, the analysis relies on deterministic state trajectories. This setting introduces a model mismatch between the estimator and the system, causing the covariance estimates to no longer reflect the actual estimation errors. To enable accurate performance prediction for fixed state trajectories without relying on computationally intensive Monte Carlo simulations, we derive recursive MSE expressions with linear time complexity. The proposed framework also accounts for measurement model mismatch and provides an efficient tool for performance evaluation in benchmark studies with long trajectories. Simulation results confirm the accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed method.

Title: CUNEC: A Path Loss Model for Urban Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks
Authors: Thomas Choi, Yuning Zhang, Issei Kanno, Masaaki Ito, Andreas F. Molisch
Abstract: Accurate path loss (PL) modeling is essential for evaluating and optimizing cell-free massive MIMO systems, especially in dense urban environments where traditional models fail to capture the complexity of real-world propagation. This paper introduces CUNEC (Cell-free massive MIMO for Urban Non-stationary Environments with Correlations, a novel PL model that accounts for spatial non-stationarity, inter-access point (AP)/user equipment (UE) correlations, and urban-specific propagation phenomena such as corner diffraction and street canyon this http URL segments AP-UE paths by street order, models PL as a stochastic function of urban geometry, and integrates spatially correlated shadowing. The parameters are derived from large-scale ray tracing and validated against both additional ray tracing in New York, NY and real-world channel measurements in Los Angeles, CA. Compared to the conventional alpha-beta model, CUNEC significantly improves accuracy in the considered urban propagation scenarios. An open-source dataset comprising over 30,000 AP locations and 128 UE positions is also released to support reproducible research and future system development.

Title: CBF Based Quadratic Program for Trajectory Tracking of Underatuated Marine Vessels
Authors: Ji-Hong Li
Abstract: By introducing two polar coordinates transformations, the marine vessel's original two-input-three-output second-order tracking model can be reduced to a two-input-two-output feedback form. However, the resulting system does not confirm to the strict-feedback structure, leading to potential singularity when designing the stabilizing function for the virtual input in the recursive controller design. Moreover, the polar coordinate transformation itself inherently introduces singularities. To address these singularity issues, this paper employs a control barrier function (CBF) based approach and formulates the trajectory tracking problem as a quadratic program (QP) solved via a QP optimizer. Numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Quantitative MRI (qMRI) offers tissue-specific biomarkers that can be tracked over time or compared across populations; however, its adoption in clinical research is hindered by significant computational demands of parameter estimation. Images acquired at high spatial resolution or requiring fitting multiple parameters often require lengthy processing time, constraining their use in routine pipelines and slowing methodological innovation and clinical translation. We present GACELLE, an open source, GPU-accelerated framework for high-throughput qMRI analysis. GACELLE provides a stochastic gradient descent optimiser and a stochastic sampler in MATLAB, enabling fast parameter mapping, improved estimation robustness via spatial regularisation, and uncertainty quantification. GACELLE prioritises accessibility: users only need to provide a forward signal model, while GACELLE's backend manages computational parallelisation, automatic parameter updates, and memory-batching. The stochastic solver performs fully vectorised Markov chain Monte Carlo with identical likelihood on CPU and GPU, ensuring reproducibility across hardware. Benchmarking demonstrates up to 451-fold acceleration for the stochastic gradient descent solver and 14,380-fold acceleration for stochastic sampling compared to CPU-based estimation, without compromising accuracy. We demonstrated GACELLE's versatility on three representative qMRI models and on an image reconstruction task. Across these applications, GACELLE improves parameter precision, enhances test-retest reproducibility, and reduces noise in quantitative maps. By combining speed, usability and flexibility, GACELLE provides a generalisable optimisation framework for medical image analysis. It lowers the computational barrier for qMRI, paving the way for reproducible biomarker development, large-scale imaging studies, and clinical translation.

Authors: Arindom Chakraborty, Mehedi Hasan, Amzad Hossain, Meratun Junnut Anee
Abstract: With an ever-growing urban population, the need for transportation is increasing at an alarming rate. Thus, the massive increase in the number of vehicles is creating traffic congestion which creates various environmental, societal, and economic problems. To tackle traffic-related issues, several Smart Traffic Systems (STS) have been proposed and implemented. As a result, a comprehensive review of STS has become necessary. The main objective of this paper is to provide an overview and a thorough review of the existing STSs in terms of various technological approaches, traffic detection technologies using different sensors, various networking/communication tools, and their pros and cons. The paper also provides information on major STS services. In addition, challenges related to modern STS are identified. Therefore, the taxonomy of STSs provided in this paper will aid researchers, urban planners, and policymakers to recognize and install the best-suited STSs for their settings.

Title: Bistatic Passive Tracking via CSI Power
Authors: Zhongqin Wang, J. Andrew Zhang, Kai Wu, Kuangda Chen, Min Xu, Y. Jay Guo
Abstract: Accurate object tracking in Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) applications remains challenging due to limited signal bandwidth, sparse antenna arrays, and clock asynchronism inherent in bistatic transceiver deployments. This paper proposes PowerSense, a real-time passive tracking framework that operates directly on the power of Channel State Information (CSI). Although CSI phase carries fine-grained information, its time-varying distortions require complex processing, which introduces additional interference during tracking. Instead, this work solely relies on CSI power for accurate sensing. We first remove all CSI phase offsets through a self-conjugate operation, yielding phase-independent CSI power. A cascaded Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is then applied to extract delay, angle-of-arrival (AoA), and Doppler features, followed by object detection, outlier removal, and continuous trajectory estimation via an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). To enable fine-grained motion sensing, the estimated target positions are further used to extract refined micro-Doppler signatures. Using 3.1 GHz LTE and 5 GHz WiFi bistatic signals with a 20 MHz bandwidth, our indoor experiments achieve a median tracking error of 0.4 m, without performing any pre-deployment system calibration, while simultaneously extracting clear and unambiguous micro-Doppler signatures of the tracked target.

Title: Output-Feedback Stabilizing Policy Iteration for Convergence Assurance of Unknown Discrete-Time Systems with Unmeasurable States
Authors: Dongdong Li, Jiuxiang Dong
Abstract: This note proposes a data-driven output-feedback stabilizing policy iteration for unknown linear discrete-time systems with unmeasurable states. Existing policy iteration methods for optimal control must start from a stabilizing control policy, which is particularly challenging to obtain for unknown systems, especially when states are unavailable. In such cases, it is more difficult to guarantee stability and convergence performance. To address this problem, an output-feedback stabilizing policy iteration framework is developed to learn closed-loop stabilizing control policies while ensuring convergence performance. Specifically, cumulative scalar parameters are introduced to compress the original system to a stable scale. Then, by integrating modified policy iteration with parameter update rules, the system is gradually amplified/restored to the original system while preserving stability such that the stabilizing control policy is obtained. The entire process is driven solely by input-output data. Moreover, a stability analysis is provided for output-feedback. The proposed approach is validated by simulations.

Title: An Equality Set Projection Approach for TSO-DSO Coordination Dispatch
Authors: Bo Li, Xicong Pang, Guangrui Wei, Haiwang Zhong, Grant Ruan, Zhengmao Li, Edris Pouresmaeil
Abstract: Coordinated optimization dispatch (COD) of transmission system operator (TSO) and distribution system operator (DSO) can effectively ensure system security and efficiency under high-penetration distributed energy resource (DER) integration. Researches of large-scale COD problem can be categorized into iterative approaches that allow DSO to dispatch independently, and non-iterative methods based on projections of feasible regions (FR). However, the iterative methods suffer from low computational convergence and efficiency, while non-iterative methods struggle to solve equivalent projections with high-dimensional FR. To address these issues, this paper proposes a TSO-DSO coordinated dispatch approach based on an accelerated non-iterative Equality Set Projection (ESP) algorithm. First, ESP algorithm is employed to overcome the bottleneck of high-dimensional FR construction. Second, an regularization-based accelerated method is proposed to reduce computational burden when degeneracy occurs. Accelerated ESP algorithm constructs projection of FR via adjacent facet searching. Therefore, it is less sensitive to the increase of vertices and could efficiently construct the projection of high-dimensional FR. Case studies on a polyhedron dataset, IEEE 33-Bus System and T118D10 TSO-DSO system demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed COD approach.

Title: A Model and Data Dual-driven Approach for Multitargets Detection under Mainlobe Jamming
Authors: Ruohai Guo, Jiang Zhu, Chengjie Yu, Zhigang Wang, Ning Zhang, Fengzhong Qu, Min Gong
Abstract: In modern radar systems, target detection and parameter estimation face significant challenges when confronted with mainlobe jamming. This paper presents a Diffusion-based Model and Data Dual-driven (DMDD) approach to estimate and detect multitargets and suppress structured jamming. In DMDD, the jamming prior is modeled through a score-based diffusion process with its score learned from the pure jamming data, enabling posterior sampling without requiring detailed knowledge of jamming. Meanwhile, the target signal is usually sparse in the range space, which can be modeled via a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework, and hyperparameter is updated through the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. A single diffusion process is constructed for the jamming, while the state of targets are estimated through direct posterior inference, enhancing computational efficiency. The noise variance is also estimated through EM algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in structured jamming scenarios. The proposed DMDD algorithm achieves superior target detection performance, compared with existing methods.

Title: Foundation Model for Intelligent Wireless Communications
Authors: Boxun Liu, Xuanyu Liu, Shijian Gao, Xiang Cheng, Liuqing Yang
Abstract: The evolution toward intelligent next-generation wireless systems promises unprecedented spectral efficiency and reliability but is hindered by a paradigm of narrow and data-hungry AI models. Breaking from this constraint, this work introduces WiFo-2, a revolutionary wireless foundation model that establishes a new state of the art for extensive channel state information (CSI)-based tasks. Uniquely architected as a sparse mixture of experts, WiFo-2 effectively manages heterogeneous data and tasks while enabling highly efficient inference. It is pretrained on a massive and diverse dataset of 11.6 billion CSI points, which enables the acquisition of profound and generalizable channel knowledge. WiFo-2 demonstrates remarkable zero-shot capabilities, not only matching but surpassing the full-shot performance of task-specific baselines on unseen configurations, all while providing reliable confidence estimates. Furthermore, the model achieves exceptional performance on eight key downstream tasks with minimal fine-tuning. A functional hardware prototype demonstrates its real-world deployment feasibility and significant system gains, highlighting WiFo-2's superiority and paving the way for a paradigm shift in AI-based wireless systems.

Title: Pinching-Antenna Systems-Assisted SWIPT: A Rate-Energy Trade-off Perspective
Authors: Qi Yang, Kai Liu, Jingjing Zhao, Kaiquan Cai, Xidong Mu, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: This paper investigates the rate-energy trade-off for pinching-antenna systems (PASS)-assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) systems. Both the single information user (IU)/energy user (EU) and multiple IUs/EUs scenarios are considered.1) For the single IU/EU scenario, a pinching beamforming optimization problem is formulated for simultaneously maximizing data rate and harvested energy. To tackle this problem, a two-stage algorithm is proposed. Specifically, the successive convex approximation (SCA) method is first invoked for minimizing the large-scale path loss, which is followed by the fine-tuning method for the phase alignment. 2) For the multiple IUs/EUs scenario, three multiple access schemes are considered, i.e., frequency division multiple access (FDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). The corresponding multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) that simultaneously maximizes the minimum data rate and minimum harvested energy is formulated for ensuring users' fairness. To address this problem, we adopt the $\epsilon$-constraint method to first convert the intractable MOOPs to single-objective optimization problems (SOOPs). Then, for the SOOP under each multiple access protocol, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and convex optimization methods are adopted for solving the pinching beamforming and resource allocation problems, respectively. Simulation results unveil that: i) PASS can achieve a significantly superior rate-energy region compared to conventional fixed-position antenna systems for pinching beamforming; and ii) by exploiting the time-switching feature, TDMA can outperform both NOMA and FDMA for the multiple IUs/EUs scenario.

Title: Joint Scheduling of Workload Demand and Energy Supply in Low-carbon Data Centers with Decision-Dependent Uncertainty Set
Authors: Maoyuan Ma, Wangyi Guo, Lei Yang, Zhanbo Xu, Xiaohong Guan
Abstract: This paper addresses the joint scheduling problem of stochastic workloads and a hydrogen-enabled distributed energy system in a low-carbon Internet data centers (IDC). Although such workloads can be shifted over temporal and spatial horizons, it poses challenges when they cannot be accurately predicted, resulting in significant efficiency degradation and high operational cost of the energy system. The problem becomes even more difficult when the workload shifting decisions would influence their randomness, which is natural for the IDC workloads. To tackle these issues, we propose a workload classification model based on the decision-dependent uncertainty set, where the spatiotemporal elasticity of different types of random workloads are clearly identified and the decision dependencies are explicitly described as linear constraints. Thus, a mixed integer program is then established for the optimal scheduling of both workload demand and energy supply. To enhance system resilience against high volatility scenarios, a rolling horizon algorithm is developed to ensure nonanticipativity and full-scenario feasibility. Numerical tests demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits effective workload scheduling decisions with dramatic energy operational cost reductions compared to the benchmarks under most of the uncertain scenarios.

Title: ColonAdapter: Geometry Estimation Through Foundation Model Adaptation for Colonoscopy
Authors: Zhiyi Jiang, Yifu Wang, Xuelian Cheng, Zongyuan Ge
Abstract: Estimating 3D geometry from monocular colonoscopy images is challenging due to non-Lambertian surfaces, moving light sources, and large textureless regions. While recent 3D geometric foundation models eliminate the need for multi-stage pipelines, their performance deteriorates in clinical scenes. These models are primarily trained on natural scene datasets and struggle with specularity and homogeneous textures typical in colonoscopy, leading to inaccurate geometry estimation. In this paper, we present ColonAdapter, a self-supervised fine-tuning framework that adapts geometric foundation models for colonoscopy geometry estimation. Our method leverages pretrained geometric priors while tailoring them to clinical data. To improve performance in low-texture regions and ensure scale consistency, we introduce a Detail Restoration Module (DRM) and a geometry consistency loss. Furthermore, a confidence-weighted photometric loss enhances training stability in clinical environments. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in camera pose estimation, monocular depth prediction, and dense 3D point map reconstruction, without requiring ground-truth intrinsic parameters.

Title: Content Adaptive Encoding For Interactive Game Streaming
Authors: Shakarim Soltanayev, Odysseas Zisimopoulos, Mohammad Ashraful Anam, Man Cheung Kung, Angeliki Katsenou, Yiannis Andreopoulos
Abstract: Video-on-demand streaming has benefitted from \textit{content-adaptive encoding} (CAE), i.e., adaptation of resolution and/or quantization parameters for each scene based on convex hull optimization. However, CAE is very challenging to develop and deploy for interactive game streaming (IGS). Commercial IGS services impose ultra-low latency encoding with no lookahead or buffering, and have extremely tight compute constraints for any CAE algorithm execution. We propose the first CAE approach for resolution adaptation in IGS based on compact encoding metadata from past frames. Specifically, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to infer the best resolution from the options available for the upcoming scene based on a running window of aggregated coding block statistics from the current scene. By deploying the trained CNN within a practical IGS setup based on HEVC encoding, our proposal: (i) improves over the default fixed-resolution ladder of HEVC by 2.3 Bjøntegaard Delta-VMAF points; (ii) infers using 1ms of a single CPU core per scene, thereby having no latency overhead.

Title: NOMA Assisted Downlink Power Allocation in Pinching Antenna Systems Using Convolutional Neural Network
Authors: Saeed Mohammadzadeh, Kanapathippillai Cumanan, Zhiguo Ding
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a flexible-antenna architecture, referred to as a pinching-antenna (PA) system, in which multiple PAs realized by activating small dielectric particles along a dielectric waveguide are jointly employed to serve a single-antenna user. We investigate antenna placement and power allocation optimization in PA-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems using a convolutional neural network (CNN). An optimization strategy is developed to determine the PA locations that maximize achievable NOMA performance while satisfying physical and spatial constraints. The proposed method adopts a two-stage structure, combining a user-aware initialization with a gradient-based refinement, enabling near-optimal performance with significantly lower computational cost. A max-min fairness formulation is introduced for power allocation to balance the power budget among users with varying channel strengths, solved efficiently via quasi-linear programming and bisection search. Finally, a CNN-based learning framework is employed to capture the nonlinear mapping between channel conditions and the corresponding optimal power coefficients. This framework can infer near-optimal power allocations for unseen network configurations without retraining, offering scalability and adaptability. Simulation results show that the proposed CNN-based NOMA approach for PA systems improves sum rate and user fairness while reducing computational complexity.

Title: A Bio-Inspired Whisker Sensor toward Underwater Flow Sensing in Darkness and Turbidity
Authors: Zheyi Hang, Denghan Xiong, Pengo Xie, Huan Hu
Abstract: Underwater flow sensing is critical for unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and environmental monitoring, yet existing sensors often suffer from low responsiveness, high detection thresholds, limited directional discrimination, complex packaging, and poor long-term stability, especially for navigation and target perception in turbid and cluttered waters. Previous solutions based on traditional strain gauges with limited detection accuracy or doped silicon sensors with limited detection height have shown feasibility but still face challenges in scalability, robustness under harsh aquatic conditions, and calibration complexity. This work presents a bio-inspired whisker sensor that provides a balanced solution by embedding high-gauge-factor silicon strain gauges into a flexible PDMS base, mimicking seal whiskers to offer both high sensitivity and simplified packaging. The device exhibits a linear force-resistance response with a limit of detection of 0.27 mN, maintains stability after 10,000 loading cycles, and shows minimal offset drift of less than 2 percent. It also demonstrates frequency matching in underwater dipole tests with clear longitudinal and transverse spatial response patterns. These results indicate a robust and scalable route for underwater flow sensing on UUV platforms in practical deployments.

Title: Distributed Koopman Operator Learning for Perception and Safe Navigation
Authors: Ali Azarbahram, Shenyu Liu, Gian Paolo Incremona
Abstract: This paper presents a unified and scalable framework for predictive and safe autonomous navigation in dynamic transportation environments by integrating model predictive control (MPC) with distributed Koopman operator learning. High-dimensional sensory data are employed to model and forecast the motion of surrounding dynamic obstacles. A consensus-based distributed Koopman learning algorithm enables multiple computational agents or sensing units to collaboratively estimate the Koopman operator without centralized data aggregation, thereby supporting large-scale and communication-efficient learning across a networked system. The learned operator predicts future spatial densities of obstacles, which are subsequently represented through Gaussian mixture models. Their confidence ellipses are approximated by convex polytopes and embedded as linear constraints in the MPC formulation to guarantee safe and collision-free navigation. The proposed approach not only ensures obstacle avoidance but also scales efficiently with the number of sensing or computational nodes, aligning with cooperative perception principles in intelligent transportation system (ITS) applications. Theoretical convergence guarantees and predictive constraint formulations are established, and extensive simulations demonstrate reliable, safe, and computationally efficient navigation performance in complex environments.

Title: Adaptive Dual-Windowing Strategies for Multi-Target Detection in OFDM ISAC
Authors: Ali Al Khansa, Youssef Bahannis
Abstract: In Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems, a key challenge is balancing sidelobe attenuation and resolution for multi-target detection scenarios. While windowing functions are typically used to manage this trade-off, state-of-the-art methods rely on a single, fixed window followed by a predefined detection strategy (e.g., Binary Successive Target Cancellation (BSTC) (low complexity) or Coherent Successive Target Cancellation (CSTC) (high performance)). This paper proposes a novel dual-window periodogram-based algorithm that leverages two complementary windows: one optimized for resolution and the other for sidelobe suppression. Then, a low-complexity detection algorithm (e.g., BSTC) is applied to both, and a decision mechanism compares the outputs. When results align, the resolution-optimized estimates are directly used; otherwise, high performance algorithm (e.g., CSTC) is triggered to resolve ambiguities. This adaptive approach dynamically balances the detection performance and the complexity, addressing limitations in existing fixed strategies. The Numerical results confirm that the proposed method achieves high performance while reducing the complexity, especially at a high Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR).

Title: Learning to Count Targets from Dual-Window: A CNN Approach for OFDM ISAC
Authors: Ali Al Khansa
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) waveforms is a key enabler for next-generation wireless systems. Recent studies show that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can estimate the number of targets from two-dimensional (2D) range-Doppler periodogram maps, yet accuracy often degrades as scenes become denser. One significant factor is the classical resolution-sidelobe attenuation trade-off, which limits performance when targets are weak or closely spaced. While windowing is routinely applied to shape this trade-off, the choice is typically static. This paper proposes a new CNN method that uses two windowed range-Doppler periodograms and learns to fuse complementary views: one window optimized for resolution and one window optimized for sidelobe suppression. The design explicitly targets the resolution-sidelobe attenuation trade-off by exposing the model to complementary windowed maps and letting it learn when each is most informative. Numerical experiments show consistent gains over single-window CNN baselines, with better scaling in target density and greater robustness across different noise levels.

Title: Learning the MPC objective function from human preferences
Authors: Pablo Krupa, Hasna El Hasnaouy, Mario Zanon, Alberto Bemporad
Abstract: In Model Predictive Control (MPC), the objective function plays a central role in determining the closed-loop behavior of the system, and must therefore be designed to achieve the desired closed-loop performance. However, in real-world scenarios, its design is often challenging, as it requires balancing complex trade-offs and accurately capturing a performance criterion that may not be easily quantifiable in terms of an objective function. This paper explores preference-based learning as a data-driven approach to constructing an objective function from human preferences over trajectory pairs. We formulate the learning problem as a machine learning classification task to learn a surrogate model that estimates the likelihood of a trajectory being preferred over another. The approach provides a surrogate model that can directly be used as an MPC objective function. Numerical results show that we can learn objective functions that provide closed-loop trajectories that align with the expressed human preferences.

Title: Enabling Full-Duplex LEO Satellite Systems with Non-Reciprocal BD-RIS-Assisted Beamforming
Authors: Ziang Liu, Wonjae Shin, Bruno Clerckx
Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite is a promising technology for providing low-latency, high-data-rate, and wide-coverage communication services. However, the high mobility of LEO satellites necessitates fast and accurate beam steering to continuously serve ground devices. While large antenna arrays can address these challenges, strict constraints on power, size, and weight make such solutions difficult to implement. Furthermore, future non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) require high spectral efficiency, which motivates the adoption of in-band full-duplex (FD) systems. {To overcome these challenges, we propose an FD LEO satellite system, where the non-reciprocal beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (NR-BD-RIS) and multiple transmit and receive antennas are attached to the LEO satellite. The NR-BD-RIS reflects the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) signals by passive beamforming.} By incorporating non-reciprocal components into the impedance network of RIS, the NR-BD-RIS breaks channel reciprocity, facilitating simultaneous support for multiple beam directions. To cover a wide coverage, we propose a time-sharing scheduling framework where, in each time slot, the NR-BD-RIS simultaneously serves multiple DL and multiple UL ground devices. An optimization problem is defined to maximize the weighted sum-rate over the entire scheduling period. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed NR-BD-RIS significantly performs better than both conventional BD-RIS and diagonal RIS (D-RIS) regarding DL and UL sum-rate performance under both single-user (SU) and multiple-user (MU) cases. Additionally, the NR-BD-RIS requires less frequent reconfiguration compared to other two types of RIS, making it more practical for implementation.

Title: A model predictive control framework with customer-priority tiers for virtual power plant resilience during extreme weather: A UK heatwave case study
Authors: Edward Moroshko, Weizhe Qin, Desen Kirli, Mohammed Qais, Sotirios Tsaftaris, Aristides Kiprakis
Abstract: Due to changes in frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves and storms, power systems around the globe are having to deal with increased imbalance between demand and supply and additional risk of loss of supply, calling for advanced control strategies that strengthen system resilience. This paper develops a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for coordination of Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) that manages photovoltaic (PV) systems, batteries, and loads before, during, and after extreme weather events. A multi-objective mixed-integer quadratically constrained program is solved to enforce customer-priority tiers, serving critical loads first, while minimizing operating cost and PV curtailment under network and device constraints. Simulations on the IEEE 33-bus distribution network with real UK heatwave data show that, under realistic forecast errors and modeling uncertainties, MPC improves resilience by 11-20% relative to traditional full-horizon optimization. These results indicate the practical viability of receding-horizon coordination for resilient, low-carbon VPP operation during extreme weather.

Title: Hard Spatial Gating for Precision-Driven Brain Metastasis Segmentation: Addressing the Over-Segmentation Paradox in Deep Attention Networks
Authors: Rowzatul Zannath Prerona
Abstract: Brain metastasis segmentation in MRI remains a formidable challenge due to diminutive lesion sizes (5-15 mm) and extreme class imbalance (less than 2% tumor volume). While soft-attention CNNs are widely used, we identify a critical failure mode termed the "over-segmentation paradox," where models achieve high sensitivity (recall > 0.88) but suffer from catastrophic precision collapse (precision < 0.23) and boundary errors exceeding 150 mm. This imprecision poses significant risks for stereotactic radiosurgery planning. To address this, we introduce the Spatial Gating Network (SG-Net), a precision-first architecture employing hard spatial gating mechanisms. Unlike traditional soft attention, SG-Net enforces strict feature selection to aggressively suppress background artifacts while preserving tumor features. Validated on the Brain-Mets-Lung-MRI dataset (n=92), SG-Net achieves a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.5578 +/- 0.0243 (95% CI: 0.45-0.67), statistically outperforming Attention U-Net (p < 0.001) and ResU-Net (p < 0.001). Most critically, SG-Net demonstrates a threefold improvement in boundary precision, achieving a 95% Hausdorff Distance of 56.13 mm compared to 157.52 mm for Attention U-Net, while maintaining robust recall (0.79) and superior precision (0.52 vs. 0.20). Furthermore, SG-Net requires only 0.67M parameters (8.8x fewer than Attention U-Net), facilitating deployment in resource-constrained environments. These findings establish hard spatial gating as a robust solution for precision-driven lesion detection, directly enhancing radiosurgery accuracy.

Authors: António Barros, Christoph Studer
Abstract: We present a computationally-efficient algorithm for time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation that is robust under multipath propagation and strong interference. Our algorithm leverages multiple receive antennas to combine adaptive spatial filtering with autodifferentiation in order to super-resolve the tap of the first-arriving path at low computational complexity and without requiring model-order estimation. We use simulations with ray-traced indoor propagation channels to demonstrate significant performance improvements over conventional correlation-based ToA estimation methods and subspace techniques such as JADE.

Title: Advances in electromagnetic techniques for subsurface infrastructure detection: A comprehensive review of methods, challenges, and innovations
Authors: Arasti Afrasiabi, Farough Rahimzadeh, Alireza Keshavarzi
Abstract: This review paper explores the state-of-the-art in non-intrusive methods for detecting and characterising buried infrastructure, focusing on Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT), Infrared Thermography (IRT), and magnetometry, along with data fusion techniques and mathematical estimators. ERT and IRT offer distinct advantages in subsurface imaging, while magnetometry provides omnidirectional measurements ideal for detecting ferrous targets. Despite these benefits, each method has inherent limitations, such as challenges in depth estimation and difficulties in distinguishing between various subsurface objects. The integration of multiple sensing techniques through data fusion approaches has shown significant promise in overcoming these limitations and improving detection accuracy. Additionally, mathematical estimators, including Kalman filters and particle filters, play a crucial role in reducing noise and enhancing the precision of geophysical surveys. This review discusses the strengths, limitations, and future research needs of these techniques, offering a comprehensive understanding of their current and potential applications in buried infrastructure detection. The paper concludes by emphasising the importance of optimising sensor performance, refining fusion algorithms, and exploring hybrid models for real-time data processing in future research.

Title: Rethinking Signaling Design for ISAC: From Pilot-Based to Payload-Based Sensing
Authors: Yunxin Li, Ying Zhang, Christos Masouros, Sofie Pollin, Fan Liu
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) is emerging as a key enabler for 6G networks, with signaling design at the core of its evolution. This paper reviews the paradigm shift of ISAC signaling designs from pilot-aided sensing to data payload-based approaches, with a particular focus on how these techniques can be realized within existing 5G NR structures. We commence with the reuse of pilots and reference signals that exploit existing 5G New Radio (NR) structures for sensing. Then, we extend to more advanced approaches that integrate the data payload through novel constellation shaping, modulation bases, and pulse shaping filters. We highlight the opportunities and tradeoffs that arise when extending sensing from sparse pilot and reference signal resources to the full communication frame, emphasizing how constellation properties and modulation choices directly determine sensing performance. To illustrate practical feasibility, a case study on sensing-assisted NR Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) networks demonstrates how exploiting both reference signals and payload echoes can reduce signaling overhead and enable proactive beam management and handover.

Title: A Cyber-Physical Systems Framework for Tracking Post Thermal-Runaway Temperature and Smoke Dynamics in Underground Mines
Authors: Yukta Pareek, Khadija Omar Said, Satadru Dey, Ashish Ranjan Kumar
Abstract: Underground mining operations are actively exploring the use of large-format lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) to power their equipment. LIBs have high energy density, long cycle life, and favorable safety record. They also have low noise, heat, and emission footprints. This fosters a conducive workplace environment for underground mining personnel. However, many occurrences of LIB failure have resulted in dangerous situations in underground mines. The combustion products, including toxic emissions, can rapidly travel throughout the mine using the ventilation network. Therefore, it is critical to monitor the temperature and smoke concentration underground at all times to ensure the safety of the miners. High-fidelity models can be developed for specific scenarios of LIB failure, but are computationally prohibitive for large underground mine volumes, complex geometries, and long duration combustion events. To mitigate computation-related issues associated with high-fidelity models, we developed cyber-physical systems (CPS) models to examine temperature and smoke dynamics. The mine supervisory control center, acting as the cyber framework, operates in conjunction with the physical underground mine. The CPS models, trained on high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model data sets, present an exceptional estimate of the evolution of temperature and smoke concentration in the underground mine tunnel. Once implemented, the research results can help mine operators make informed decisions during emergencies.

Title: Optimal Singular Perturbation-based Model Reduction for Heterogeneous Power Systems
Authors: Yue Huang, Dixant B. Sapkota, Manish K. Singh
Abstract: Power systems are globally experiencing an unprecedented growth in size and complexity due to the advent of nonconventional generation and consumption technologies. To navigate computational complexity, power system dynamic models are often reduced using techniques based on singular perturbation. However, several technical assumptions enabling traditional approaches are being challenged due to the heterogeneous, and often black-box, nature of modern power system component models. This work proposes two singular perturbation approaches that aim to optimally identify fast states that shall be reduced, without prior knowledge about the physical meaning of system states. After presenting a timescale-agnostic formulation for singular perturbation, the first approach uses greedy optimization to sequentially select states to be reduced. The second approach relies on a nonlinear optimization routine allowing state transformations while obtaining an optimally reduced model. Numerical studies on a test system featuring synchronous machines, inverters, and line dynamics demonstrate the generalizability and accuracy of the developed approaches.

Title: FPGA-Enabled Modulo ADC with x100 Dynamic-Range Expansion: Hardware Design and Performance Evaluation
Authors: Zeyuan Li, Wenyi Yan, Lu Gan, Guoquan Li, Hongqing Liu
Abstract: Conventional analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) fail to capture high-dynamic-range (HDR) signals due to clipping. Modulo ADCs circumvent this limitation by folding the input prior to quantization and algorithmically reconstructing the original waveform. This work presents a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based modulo ADC platform for systematic HDR performance evaluation. The mixed-signal architecture integrates a precision analog front end with a 200-MHz FPGA control loop that incorporates multi-bit updates and digital under-compensation calibration, ensuring stable folding and accurate feedback generation. The system achieves more than a hundred-fold dynamic-range expansion within a 400-kHz bandwidth while maintaining fidelity comparable to that of a conventional ADC. A system-on-chip (SoC)-like implementation enables on-board real-time recovery and supports benchmarking of state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms, providing a compact and practical framework for HDR signal acquisition and evaluation.

Title: Moduli Selection in Robust Chinese Remainder Theorem: Closed-Form Solutions and Layered Design
Authors: Wenyi Yan, Lu Gan, Hongqing Liu, Shaoqing Hu
Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of \emph{moduli selection} in the Robust Chinese Remainder Theorem (RCRT), where each residue may be perturbed by a bounded error. Consider $L$ moduli of the form $m_i = \Gamma_i m$ ($1 \le i \le L$), where $\Gamma_i$ are pairwise coprime integers and $m \in \mathbb{R}^+$ is a common scaling factor. For small $L$ ($L = 2, 3, 4$), we obtain exact solutions that maximize the robustness margin under dynamic-range and modulus-bound constraints. We also introduce a Fibonacci-inspired \emph{layered} construction (for $L = 2$) that produces exactly $K$ robust decoding layers, enabling predictable trade-offs between error tolerance and dynamic range. We further analyze how robustness and range evolve across layers and provide a closed-form expression to estimate the success probability under common data and noise models. The results are promising for various applications, such as sub-Nyquist sampling, phase unwrapping, range estimation, modulo analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), and robust residue-number-system (RNS)-based accelerators for deep learning. Our framework thus establishes a general theory of moduli design for RCRT, complementing prior algorithmic work and underscoring the broad relevance of robust moduli design across diverse information-processing domains.

Title: Switching control of underactuated multi-channel systems with input constraints for cooperative manipulation
Authors: Dongjae Lee, Dimos V. Dimarogonas, H. Jin Kim
Abstract: This work presents an event-triggered switching control framework for a class of nonlinear underactuated multi-channel systems with input constraints. These systems are inspired by cooperative manipulation tasks involving underactuation, where multiple underactuated agents collaboratively push or pull an object to a target pose. Unlike existing approaches for multi-channel systems, our method addresses underactuation and the potential loss of controllability by additionally addressing channel assignment of agents. To simultaneously account for channel assignment, input constraints, and stabilization, we formulate the control problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming and derive sufficient conditions for its feasibility. To improve real-time computation efficiency, we introduce an event-triggered control scheme that maintains stability even between switching events through a quadratic programming-based stabilizing controller. We theoretically establish the semi-global exponential stability of the proposed method and the asymptotic stability of its extension to nonprehensile cooperative manipulation under noninstantaneous switching. The proposed framework is further validated through numerical simulations on 2D and 3D free-flyer systems and multi-robot nonprehensile pushing tasks.

Title: Power System Robust State Estimation As a Layer: A Novel End-to-end Learning Approach
Authors: Yibo Ding, Wenzhuo Shi, Mengzhao Duan, Yuhong Zhao, Jiaqi Ruan, Jian Zhao, Zhao Xu
Abstract: Serving as an essential prerequisite for modern power system operation, robust state estimation (RSE) could effectively resist noises and outliers in measurements. The emerging neural network (NN) based end-to-end (E2E) learning framework enables real-time application of RSE but cannot strictly enforce the physical constraints involved, potentially yielding solutions that are statistically accurate yet physically inconsistent. To bridge this gap, this work proposes a novel E2E learning based RSE framework, where the RSE problem is innovatively constructed as an explicit differentiable layer of NN for the first time, ensuring physics alignments with rigors. Also, the measurement weights are treated as learnable parameters of NN to enhance estimation robustness. A hybrid loss function is formulated to pursue accurate and physically consistent solutions. To realize the proposed NN structure, the original non-convex RSE problem is specially relaxed. Extensive numerical simulations have been carried out to demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly improve the SE performance while fulfilling physical consistency on six testing systems, in comparisons to the classical E2E learning based approach and the physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach.

Title: Embodied Intelligent Wireless (EIW): Synesthesia of Machines Empowered Wireless Communications
Authors: Xiang Cheng, Weibo Wen, Haotian Zhang, Boxun Liu, Zonghui Yang, Jianan Zhang, Xuesong Cai
Abstract: The evolution toward the sixth-generation (6G) and beyond mobile communication systems is marked by a fundamental shift from merely connecting devices to enabling pervasive and embodied intelligence. While recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-native wireless communication designs have achieved remarkable progress, the prevailing paradigm remains limited to static, modular AI substitutions. This approach fails to meet the core requirements of future wireless networks: the ability to continuously perceive, adapt to, and interact with the dynamic wireless environment. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces Embodied Intelligent Wireless (EIW), a novel communication paradigm inspired by embodied intelligence, which redefines the communication node as an active, environment-aware, and evolving entity. EIW is built around an observation-decision-action paradigm, comprising: multi-dimensional observations for comprehensive awareness of the environment and system states, a unified decision module for orchestrating multiple wireless agents in an interpretable manner, and actions where wireless agents exert practical effects on both the environment and communication systems. Furthermore, two enabling technologies, wireless world models as well as self-update and self-evolution mechanisms, are introduced to support training efficiency improvement, counterfactual evaluation, and better adaptation. Unlike existing communication systems, EIW envisions future communication systems not as passive data pipelines, but as intelligent entities that continuously interact with and co-evolve alongside their environments. Finally, through simulations, we showcase the advantages of the proposed EIW paradigm and its enabling techniques in shaping the design of wireless communication nodes.

Abstract: Based on the provided LaTeX code, here is the metadata for the submission form: Title: TokCom-UEP: Semantic Importance-Matched Unequal Error Protection for Resilient Image Transmission Author(s): Kaizheng Zhang, Zuolin Jin, Zhihang Cheng, Ming Zeng, Li Qiao, Zesong Fei Abstract: Token communication (TokCom), an emerging semantic communication framework powered by Large Multimodal Model (LMM), has become a key paradigm for resilient data transmission in 6G networks. A key limitation of existing TokCom designs lies in the assumption of uniform token importance, which leads to the adoption of equal error protection (EEP). However, compressed one-dimensional (1D) token sequences inherently exhibit heterogeneous semantic importance hierarchies, rendering EEP schemes suboptimal. To address this, this paper proposes TokCom-UEP, a novel semantic importance-matched unequal error protection (UEP) framework designed for resilient image transmission. TokCom-UEP integrates rateless UEP coding with the non-uniform semantic importance of tokens by partitioning source tokens into nested expanding windows, assigning higher selection probabilities to windows containing critical tokens to ensure their prioritized recovery. Simulation results demonstrate that TokCom-UEP outperforms EEP schemes in terms of three core semantic restoration metrics and spectral efficiency under low-overhead conditions.

Title: Two-Dimensional Tomographic Reconstruction From Projections With Unknown Angles and Unknown Spatial Shifts
Authors: Shreyas Jayant Grampurohit, Satish Mulleti, Ajit Rajwade
Abstract: In parallel beam computed tomography (CT), an object is reconstructed from a series of projections taken at different angles. However, in some industrial and biomedical imaging applications, the projection geometry is unknown, completely or partially. In this paper, we present a technique for two-dimensional (2D) tomography in which both viewing angles and spatial shifts associated with the projections are unknown. There exists literature on 2D unknown view tomography (UVT), but most existing 2D UVT algorithms assume that the projections are centered; that is, there are no spatial shifts in the projections. To tackle these geometric ambiguities, we first modify an existing graph Laplacian-based algorithm for 2D UVT to incorporate spatial shifts, and then use it as the initialization for the proposed three-way alternating minimization algorithm that jointly estimates the 2D structure, its projection angles, and the corresponding shifts. We evaluate our method on noisy projections of ribosome images and demonstrate that it achieves superior reconstruction compared to the baseline that neglects shifts.

Title: Switching-time bioprocess control with pulse-width-modulated optogenetics
Authors: Sebastián Espinel-Ríos
Abstract: Biotechnology can benefit from dynamic control to improve production efficiency. In this context, optogenetics enables modulation of gene expression using light as an external input, allowing fine-tuning of protein levels to unlock dynamic metabolic control and regulation of cell growth. Optogenetic systems can be actuated by light intensity. However, relying solely on intensity-driven control (i.e., signal amplitude) may fail to properly tune optogenetic bioprocesses when the dose-response relationship (i.e., light intensity versus gene-expression strength) is steep. In these cases, tunability is effectively constrained to either fully active or fully repressed gene expression, with little intermediate regulation. Pulse-width modulation, a concept widely used in electronics, can alleviate this issue by alternating between fully ON and OFF light intensity within forcing periods, thereby smoothing the average response and enhancing process controllability. Naturally, optimizing pulse-width-modulated optogenetics entails a switching-time optimal control problem with a binary input over many forcing periods. While this can be formulated as a mixed-integer program on a refined time grid, the number of decision variables can grow rapidly with increasing time-grid resolution and number of forcing periods, compromising tractability. Here, we propose an alternative solution based on reinforcement learning. We parametrize control actions via the duty cycle, a continuous variable that encodes the ON-to-OFF switching time within each forcing period, thereby respecting the intrinsic binary nature of the light intensity.

Title: RIS-Assisted Physical Layer Security: Artificial Noise-Driven Optimization and Measurements
Authors: Ahmet Muaz Aktas, Sefa Kayraklik, Sultangali Arzykulov, Galymzhan Nauryzbayev, Ibrahim Hokelek, Ali Gorcin
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a key enabler for providing signal coverage, energy efficiency, reliable communication, and physical layer security (PLS) in next-generation wireless communication networks. This paper investigates an artificial noise (AN)-driven RIS-assisted secure communication system. The RIS is partitioned into two segments, where the first segment is configured to direct the communication signal (CS) toward the legitimate user (Bob), and the other one is configured to steer the AN toward the eavesdropper (Eve). To this end, iterative and discrete Fourier transform-based algorithms are developed for practical RIS phase shift optimization. The power allocation between the CS and the AN signals is optimized in such a way that the secrecy capacity (SC) is maximized while limiting Eve's channel capacity. The proposed PLS framework is evaluated through both simulations and software defined radio based testbed experiments. The results demonstrate promising improvements in the SC, highlighting the potential of AN-driven RIS-assisted PLS for practical deployments.

Title: MICCAI STS 2024 Challenge: Semi-Supervised Instance-Level Tooth Segmentation in Panoramic X-ray and CBCT Images

Abstract: Orthopantomogram (OPGs) and Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) are vital for dentistry, but creating large datasets for automated tooth segmentation is hindered by the labor-intensive process of manual instance-level annotation. This research aimed to benchmark and advance semi-supervised learning (SSL) as a solution for this data scarcity problem. We organized the 2nd Semi-supervised Teeth Segmentation (STS 2024) Challenge at MICCAI 2024. We provided a large-scale dataset comprising over 90,000 2D images and 3D axial slices, which includes 2,380 OPG images and 330 CBCT scans, all featuring detailed instance-level FDI annotations on part of the data. The challenge attracted 114 (OPG) and 106 (CBCT) registered teams. To ensure algorithmic excellence and full transparency, we rigorously evaluated the valid, open-source submissions from the top 10 (OPG) and top 5 (CBCT) teams, respectively. All successful submissions were deep learning-based SSL methods. The winning semi-supervised models demonstrated impressive performance gains over a fully-supervised nnU-Net baseline trained only on the labeled data. For the 2D OPG track, the top method improved the Instance Affinity (IA) score by over 44 percentage points. For the 3D CBCT track, the winning approach boosted the Instance Dice score by 61 percentage points. This challenge confirms the substantial benefit of SSL for complex, instance-level medical image segmentation tasks where labeled data is scarce. The most effective approaches consistently leveraged hybrid semi-supervised frameworks that combined knowledge from foundational models like SAM with multi-stage, coarse-to-fine refinement pipelines. Both the challenge dataset and the participants' submitted code have been made publicly available on GitHub (this https URL), ensuring transparency and reproducibility.

Title: Fast Distributed Algorithm for Aggregative Games in Malicious Environment
Authors: Kai-Yuan Guo, Yan-Wu Wang, Xiao-Kang Liu, Zhi-Wei Liu
Abstract: This paper addresses the distributed Nash Equilibrium seeking problem for aggregative games, where legitimate players' decisions are affected by potential malicious players. To describe players' behavior, we introduce a novel heterogeneous trustworthiness probabilistic framework by employing stochastic trust observations. To mitigate the waste of communication and gradient computation, we utilize a compressible unbalanced network information matrix and a multi-round communication mechanism to develop a fast Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm for aggregative games with unbalanced directed networks. By integrating the multi-round communication mechanism and a trustworthiness broadcast mechanism, we embed our fast convergence algorithm into the heterogeneous trustworthiness probabilistic framework, yielding a resilient fast Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm. Theoretical analysis confirms the convergence of the algorithm. Comparative simulations verify the accuracy of our fast convergence algorithm, and validation simulations verify the resilience of the algorithm.

Title: RAG-Empowered LLM-Driven Dynamic Radio Resource Management in Open 6G RAN
Authors: Onur Salan, Burak Çırağ, Onur Sever, İbrahim Hökelek, Ali Görçin, Hakan Ali Çırpan
Abstract: Implications of the advancements in the area of artificial intelligence to the wireless communications is extremely significant, especially in terms of resource management. In this paper, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-empowered Large Language Model (ReLLM)-driven dynamic radio resource management framework for Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) inspired 6G networks is proposed. The introduced methodology leverages the ReLLM framework to interpret both historical and real-time network data, enabling adaptive control of network slices. The ReLLM is founded on two specialized agents, one is responsible for proactively detecting service level agreement (SLA) violations by continuously monitoring and estimating slice-specific performance metrics, and the other one is responsible for dynamically reallocating physical resource blocks when the SLA violation probability exceeds a pre-defined threshold. The primary objective of this dual-agent design is to minimize unnecessary LLM inference calls while satisfying the SLA requirements of the slices, thereby improving computational and energy efficiency. The proposed ReLLM framework is implemented and validated on an end-to-end O-RAN testbed built upon open-source OpenAirInterface emulators. The experimental results demonstrate that the LLM approach with its reduced token consumption feature maintains a near-zero drop ratio for the low-priority slice while simultaneously satisfying acceptable latency performance for the high-priority slice. The ReLLM-driven design improves reliability and SLA compliance, confirming its practicality for real-world O-RAN testbeds and its potential applicability to future 6G networks.

Title: RDS-DeePC: Robust Data Selection for Data-Enabled Predictive Control via Sensitivity Score
Authors: Jiachen Li, Shihao Li
Abstract: Data-Enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) offers a powerful model-free approach to predictive control, but faces two fundamental challenges: computational complexity scaling cubically with dataset size, and severe performance degradation from corrupted data. This paper introduces Robust Data Selection DeePC (RDS-DeePC), which addresses both challenges through influence function analysis. We derive a sensitivity score quantifying each trajectory segment's leverage on the optimization solution, proving that high-sensitivity segments correspond to outliers while low-sensitivity segments represent consistent data. By selecting low-sensitivity segments, RDS-DeePC achieves computational efficiency and automatic outlier filtering without requiring data quality labels. For nonlinear systems, we extend the framework through a two-stage online selection approach accelerated by the LiSSA algorithm.

Abstract: Roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing demands precise tension and velocity control under strict operational constraints. Model predictive control requires gradient computation, while sampling-based methods such as MPPI struggle with hard constraint satisfaction. This paper presents an adaptive trajectory bundle method that achieves rigorous constraint handling through derivative-free sequential convex programming. The approach approximates nonlinear dynamics and costs via interpolated sample bundles, with adaptive trust regions and penalty parameters ensuring robust convergence without manual tuning. Simulations on a six-zone R2R system demonstrate tracking accuracy comparable to gradient-based MPC with superior constraint satisfaction over sampling-based alternatives.

Title: Open-source implementation of distribution network reconfiguration methods: Analysis and comparison
Authors: Ferran Bohigas-Daranas, Oriol Gomis-Bellmunt, Eduardo Prieto-Araujo
Abstract: This paper presents a critical and practical approach to the evolution of distribution network reconfiguration algorithms, tracing their development from foundational heuristic methods introduced in 1975 to contemporary state-of-the-art techniques. The article systematically reviews seven different methodologies, including classical heuristic algorithms (Merlin, Baran, and others), advanced meta-heuristic methodologies (particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithms), and purely mathematical approaches (MILP-based), analyzing their theoretical foundations, implementation strategies, computational complexity, and performance metrics based on extensive literature review and our own empirical testing. Each methodology is assessed through standardized test systems, considering multiple objectives such as power loss minimization and voltage profile improvement. The comparative analysis reveals the strengths and limitations of each approach under various network conditions and operational constraints. Furthermore, this work provides significant value to the research community by offering an open-source repository containing documented implementations of all reviewed algorithms. This resource facilitates accessibility for newcomers to the field, promotes reproducible research, and accelerates the development of next-generation distribution network optimization solutions. The repository includes comprehensive documentation, test cases, and performance benchmarks.

Title: An LLM-Assisted Multi-Agent Control Framework for Roll-to-Roll Manufacturing Systems
Authors: Jiachen Li, Shihao Li, Christopher Martin, Zijun Chen, Dongmei Chen, Wei Li
Abstract: Roll-to-roll manufacturing requires precise tension and velocity control to ensure product quality, yet controller commissioning and adaptation remain time-intensive processes dependent on expert knowledge. This paper presents an LLM-assisted multi-agent framework that automates control system design and adaptation for R2R systems while maintaining safety. The framework operates through five phases: system identification from operational data, automated controller selection and tuning, sim-to-real adaptation with safety verification, continuous monitoring with diagnostic capabilities, and periodic model refinement. Experimental validation on a R2R system demonstrates successful tension regulation and velocity tracking under significant model uncertainty, with the framework achieving performance convergence through iterative adaptation. The approach reduces manual tuning effort while providing transparent diagnostic information for maintenance planning, offering a practical pathway for integrating AI-assisted automation in manufacturing control systems.

Title: Identification of contractive Lur'e-type systems via kernel-based Lipschitz design
Authors: Cesare Donati, Fabrizio Dabbene, Constantino Lagoa, Carlo Novara, Yoshio Ebihara
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of identifying contractive Lur'e-type systems. Specifically, it proposes an identification framework that integrates linear prior knowledge with a kernel representation of the nonlinear feedback while systematically enforcing contractivity via Lipschitz constant design. The resulting algorithms provide models that are accurate in prediction, interpretable, and faithful to the contractive nature of the true system. Numerical experiments demonstrate that enforcing contractivity significantly improves parameter estimation and yields models that are both accurate and physically meaningful.

Title: Closed-Loop Control Law for Low Thrust Orbit Transfer with Guaranteed Stability
Authors: Suraj Kumar, Aditya Rallapalli, Nivriti Priyadarshini, Bharat Kumar GVP, Ravi Kumar L
Abstract: Electric propulsion is used to maximize payload capacity in communication satellites. These orbit raising maneuvers span several months and hundreds of revolutions, making trajectory design a complex challenge. The literature typically addresses this problem using feedback laws, with Q-law being one of the most prominent approaches. However, Q-law suffers from closed-loop stability issues, limiting its suitability for real-time on-board implementation. In this work, we focus on closed-loop orbit raising rather than offline trajectory planning and address the stability limitations of the Q-law through a Lyapunov based control design. A Lyapunov-guided modification of the classical Q-law is proposed to ensure closed-loop stability and enable real-time implementation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through closed-loop orbit transfers across various scenarios, including co-planar transfers, equatorial to polar orbit transfers, and geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) to geostationary earth orbit (GEO) transfers.

Title: Control Barrier Function for Unknown Systems: An Approximation-free Approach
Authors: Shubham Sawarkar, Pushpak Jagtap
Abstract: We study the prescribed-time reach-avoid (PT-RA) control problem for nonlinear systems with unknown dynamics operating in environments with moving obstacles. Unlike robust or learning based Control Barrier Function (CBF) methods, the proposed framework requires neither online model learning nor uncertainty bound estimation. A CBF-based Quadratic Program (CBF-QP) is solved on a simple virtual system to generate a safe reference satisfying PT-RA conditions with respect to time-varying, tightened obstacle and goal sets. The true system is confined to a Virtual Confinement Zone (VCZ) around this reference using an approximation-free feedback law. This construction guarantees real-time safety and prescribed-time target reachability under unknown dynamics and dynamic constraints without explicit model identification or offline precomputation. Simulation results illustrate reliable dynamic obstacle avoidance and timely convergence to the target set.

Title: Resistant Topology Inference in Consensus Networks: A Feedback-Based Design
Authors: Yushan Li, Jiabao He, Dimos V. Dimarogonas
Abstract: Consensus networks are widely deployed in numerous civil and industrial applications. However, the process of reaching a common consensus among nodes can unintentionally reveal the network's topology to external observers by appropriate inference techniques. This paper investigates a feedback-based resistant inference design to prevent the topology from being inferred using data, while preserving the original consensus convergence. First, we characterize the conditions to preserve the original consensus, and introduce the ''accurate inference'' notion, which accounts for both the uniqueness of the solution to topology inference (solvability) and the deviation from the original topology (accuracy). Then, we employ invariant subspace analysis to characterize the solvability. Even when unique inference remains possible, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the feedback design to induce inaccurate inference, and give a Laplacian structure based distributed design. Simulations validate the effectiveness of the method.

Title: DoA Estimation with Sparse Arrays: Effects of Antenna Element Patterns and Nonidealities
Authors: Niko Lindvall, Mikko Heino, Robin Rajamäki, Mikko Valkama, Visa Koivunen
Abstract: This paper studies the effects of directional antenna element complex gain patterns and nonidealities in direction of arrival (DoA) estimation. We compare sparse arrays and classical uniform linear arrays, harnessing EM simulation tools to accurately model the electromagnetic behavior of both patch and Vivaldi antenna element including mutual coupling effects. We show that with sparse array configurations, the performance impacts are significant in terms of DoA estimation accuracy and operable SNR ranges. Specifically, in the scenarios considered, both the usage of directional antenna elements and a sparse array result in over 90% reduction in average direction finding error, compared to a uniform omnidirectional array with the same number of elements (in this case eight), when estimating the directions of two sources using the MUSIC algorithm. For a fixed angular RMSE, the improvements in array sensitivity are shown to yield a 4 to 15-fold increase in one-way coverage distance (assuming free-space path loss). Among the studied options, the best performance was obtained using sparse arrays with either patch or Vivaldi elements for field of views of 100$^\circ$ or 120$^\circ$, respectively.

Title: Scalable Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Accelerating Electromagnetic Transient Stability Assessment
Authors: Ignasi Ventura Nadal, Mohammad Kazem Bakhshizadeh, Petros Aristidou, Nicolae Darii, Rahul Nellikkath, Spyros Chatzivasileiadis
Abstract: This paper puts forward a framework to accelerate Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) simulations by replacing individual components with trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). EMT simulations are considered the cornerstone of transient stability assessment of power systems with high shares of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs), and, although accurate, they are notorious for their slow simulation speed. Taking a deeper dive into the EMT simulation algorithms, this paper identifies the most computationally expensive components of the simulation and replaces them with fast and accurate PINNs. The proposed novel PINN formulation enables a modular and scalable integration into the simulation algorithm. Using a type-4 wind turbine EMT model, we demonstrate a 4--6x simulation speedup by capturing the Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) with a PINN. We validate all our results with PSCAD software.

Title: Harnessing Chaotic Signals for Wireless Information and Power Transfer
Authors: Priyadarshi Mukherjee, Constantinos Psomas, Ioannis Krikidis
Abstract: Chaotic dynamical systems have attracted considerable attention due to their inherent randomness and high sensitivity to initial conditions, which makes them ideal for secure wireless communications. Beyond security, these same characteristics also make chaotic signals particularly effective for wireless power transfer (WPT) applications. On the other hand, connectivity along with self-sustainability are the two cornerstones of the upcoming sixth generation (6G) standard for radio communications. Consequently, with the massive increase in wireless devices and sensors, the concept of self-sustainable wireless networks is becoming more relevant. The aspect of WPT to the widely spread wireless devices and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) among these devices will play a crucial role in the 6G communication systems. In this context, it has been experimentally observed that chaotic signals result in better WPT performance as compared to the existing benchmark schemes. Hence, in this paper, we characterize the generalized WPT performance of the multi-dimensional chaotic signals and present the use case of the Lorenz and the Henon chaotic systems. Moreover, we provide a novel differential chaos shift keying (DCSK)-based WPT receiver architecture ideal for enhanced energy harvesting (EH). Furthermore, we propose DCSK-based transmit waveform designs for multi-antenna SWIPT architectures and investigate the impact of the rate-energy trade-off. Our goal is to explore these aspects of the chaotic signals and discuss their relevance in the context of both WPT and SWIPT.

Title: Development of a Load Profile Generator for Non-road Mobile Machinery
Authors: Serhiy Kapustyan, Pranav Tetey, Thomas Grube, Jochen Linssen
Abstract: This research presents a Load Profile Generator model for non-road mobile machinery, which depicts the most common operational profiles that reflect real-world conditions. This technological bottom-up model enables users to parameterize specific machines for simulation and observe their power demand at the actuator interfaces. The application of the Load Profile Generator covers different non-road mobile machinery categories, such as construction, agriculture, industrial and forestry. In this study, the Load Profile Generator was used to demonstrate common operations of material handler and forest forwarder, which have been validated against real-world data to match the results. The usage of Load Profile Generator aids engineers in evaluation machines performance by developing operation strategies. It opens doors to further systems analysis as it can serve as an interface for energy demand calculations. The model's results are accurate enough to provide a sufficient understanding of a wide range of non-road mobile machinery load profiles as well as insights about alternative fuel and power supply concepts helping in optimising the system simulation.

Title: What If They Took the Shot? A Hierarchical Bayesian Framework for Counterfactual Expected Goals
Authors: Mikayil Mahmudlu, Oktay Karakuş, Hasan Arkadaş
Abstract: This study develops a hierarchical Bayesian framework that integrates expert domain knowledge to quantify player-specific effects in expected goals (xG) estimation, addressing a limitation of standard models that treat all players as identical finishers. Using 9,970 shots from StatsBomb's 2015-16 data and Football Manager 2017 ratings, we combine Bayesian logistic regression with informed priors to stabilise player-level estimates, especially for players with few shots. The hierarchical model reduces posterior uncertainty relative to weak priors and achieves strong external validity: hierarchical and baseline predictions correlate at R2 = 0.75, while an XGBoost benchmark validated against StatsBomb xG reaches R2 = 0.833. The model uncovers interpretable specialisation profiles, including one-on-one finishing (Aguero, Suarez, Belotti, Immobile, Martial), long-range shooting (Pogba), and first-touch execution (Insigne, Salah, Gameiro). It also identifies latent ability in underperforming players such as Immobile and Belotti. The framework supports counterfactual "what-if" analysis by reallocating shots between players under identical contexts. Case studies show that Sansone would generate +2.2 xG from Berardi's chances, driven largely by high-pressure situations, while Vardy-Giroud substitutions reveal strong asymmetry: replacing Vardy with Giroud results in a large decline (about -7 xG), whereas the reverse substitution has only a small effect (about -1 xG). This work provides an uncertainty-aware tool for player evaluation, recruitment, and tactical planning, and offers a general approach for domains where individual skill and contextual factors jointly shape performance.

Title: Physical Layer Security with Artificial Noise in MIMO Pinching-Antenna Systems
Authors: Pigi P. Papanikolaou, Dimitrios Bozanis, Sotiris A. Tegos, Panagiotis D. Diamantoulakis, Panagiotis Sarigiannidis, George K. Karagiannidis
Abstract: As next-generation wireless networks emerge, security is becoming a critical performance metric. However, conventional multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems often suffer from severe path loss and are vulnerable to nearby eavesdroppers due to their fixed-antenna configurations. Pinching-antenna systems (PASs) offer a promising alternative, leveraging reconfigurable pinching antennas (PAs) positioned along low-loss dielectric waveguides to enhance channel conditions and dynamically mitigate security threats. In this paper, we propose an artificial noise (AN)-aided beamforming framework for the PAS downlink that maximizes the secrecy rate (SR) by jointly optimizing the information beams, the AN covariance, and the PA positions. We examine both perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) for the eavesdropper's channel. For the latter, location errors are mapped via a Jacobian into an ellipsoidal channel uncertainty set to accurately formulate the problem. We derive a closed-form solution for the single-waveguide scenario, yielding the optimal PA location and an information/AN power-splitting rule. For multiple waveguides and users, we develop a deep neural network (DNN)-aided joint optimizer that outputs beams, AN, and PA placements. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves SR consistently over PAS baselines in single- and multi-user settings under both perfect and imperfect CSI.

Title: Group-Aware Partial Model Merging for Children's Automatic Speech Recognition
Authors: Thomas Rolland, Alberto Abad
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for children remains challenging, primarily due to large acoustic variability and limited availability of training data. While supervised fine-tuning of adult pre-trained models has shown promise, it often fails to capture group-specific characteristics variations among children. To address this, we introduce GRoup-Aware PARtial model Merging (GRAPAM), a parameter-efficient approach that combines unsupervised clustering, partial fine-tuning, and model merging. Our approach adapts adult-pre-trained models to children by first grouping the children's data based on acoustic similarity. Each group is used to partially fine-tune an adult pre-trained model, and the resulting models are merged at the parameter level. Experiments conducted on the MyST children's speech corpus indicate that GRAPAM achieves a relative improvement of 6% of Word Error Rate (WER), using the same amount of data, outperforming full fine-tuning while training fewer parameters. These results highlight the promise of model merging as a scalable and effective strategy for children's ASR.

Title: Joint Optimization of Pilot Length, Pilot Assignment, and Power Allocation for Cell-free MIMO Systems with Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Yao Peng, Tingting Liu, Chenyang Yang
Abstract: In user-centric cell-free multi-antenna systems, pilot contamination degrades spectral efficiency (SE) severely. To mitigate pilot contamination, existing works jointly optimize pilot assignment and power allocation by assuming fixed pilot length, which fail to balance pilot overhead against the contamination. To maximize net-SE, we jointly optimize pilot length, pilot assignment, and power allocation with deep learning. Since the pilot length is a variable, the size of pilot assignment matrix is unknown during the optimization. To cope with the challenge, we design size-generalizable graph neural networks (GNNs). We prove that pilot assignment policy is a one-to-many mapping, and improperly designed GNNs cannot learn the optimal policy. We tackle this issue by introducing feature enhancement. To improve learning performance, we design a contamination-aware attention mechanism for the GNNs. Given that pilot assignment and power allocation respectively depend on large- and small-scale channels, we develop a dual-timescale GNN framework to explore the potential. To reduce inference time, a single-timescale GNN is also designed. Simulation results show that the designed GNNs outperform existing methods in terms of net-SE, training complexity, and inference time, and can be well generalized across problem scales and channels.

Title: Strategies to Minimize Out-of-Distribution Effects in Data-Driven MRS Quantification
Authors: Julian P. Merkofer, Antonia Kaiser, Anouk Schrantee, Oliver J. Gurney-Champion, Ruud J. G. van Sloun
Abstract: This study systematically compared data-driven and model-based strategies for metabolite quantification in magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), focusing on resilience to out-of-distribution (OoD) effects and the balance between accuracy, robustness, and generalizability. A neural network designed for MRS quantification was trained using three distinct strategies: supervised regression, self-supervised learning, and test-time adaptation. These were compared against model-based fitting tools. Experiments combined large-scale simulated data, designed to probe metabolite concentration extrapolation and signal variability, with 1H single-voxel 7T in-vivo human brain spectra. In simulations, supervised learning achieved high accuracy for spectra similar to those in the training distribution, but showed marked degradation when extrapolated beyond the training distribution. Test-time adaptation proved more resilient to OoD effects, while self-supervised learning achieved intermediate performance. In-vivo experiments showed larger variance across the methods (data-driven and model-based) due to domain shift. Across all strategies, overlapping metabolites and baseline variability remained persistent challenges. While strong performance can be achieved by data-driven methods for MRS metabolite quantification, their reliability is contingent on careful consideration of the training distribution and potential OoD effects. When such conditions in the target distribution cannot be anticipated, test-time adaptation strategies ensure consistency between the quantification, the data, and the model, enabling reliable data-driven MRS pipelines.

Title: Targeted-Subharmonic-Eliminating Pulse Density Modulation for Wireless Power Transfer Systems
Authors: Songyan Li, Hongchang Li, Haiyue Jiang, Yudong Zhang, Wenjie Chen, Xu Yang
Abstract: This letter proposes a targeted-subharmonic-eliminating pulse density modulation (PDM) method for series-series (SS) compensated wireless power transfer (WPT) systems. The subharmonic frequency components which excite current abnormal oscillations in PDM controlled WPT systems are eliminated through a specially designed noise transfer function (NTF). The proposed method is simple to implement in both primary and secondary sides of WPT systems and exhibits a certain tolerance to deviations caused by inaccurate coupling coefficient identification in NTF design. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method in suppressing current abnormal oscillations and reducing the fluctuations in current amplitudes.

Title: Data-Efficient Motor Condition Monitoring with Time Series Foundation Models
Authors: Deyu Li, Xinyuan Liao, Shaowei Chen, Shuai Zhao
Abstract: Motor condition monitoring is essential for ensuring system reliability and preventing catastrophic failures. However, data-driven diagnostic methods often suffer from sparse fault labels and severe class imbalance, which limit their effectiveness in real-world applications. This paper proposes a motor condition monitoring framework that leverages the general features learned during pre-training of two time series foundation models, MOMENT and Mantis, to address these challenges. By transferring broad temporal representations from large-scale pre-training, the proposed approach significantly reduces dependence on labeled data while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy. Experimental results show that MOMENT achieves nearly twice the performance of conventional deep learning models using only 1\% of the training data, whereas Mantis surpasses state-of-the-art baselines by 22\%, reaching 90\% accuracy with the same data ratio. These results demonstrate the strong generalization and data efficiency of time series foundation models in fault diagnosis, providing new insights into scalable and adaptive frameworks for intelligent motor condition monitoring.

Title: Near-Field Channel Estimation and Joint Angle-Range Recovery in XL-MIMO Systems: A Gridless Super-Resolution Approach
Authors: Feng Xi, Dehui Yang
Abstract: Existing near-field channel estimation methods for extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) typically discretize angle and range parameters jointly, resulting in large polar-domain codebooks. This paper proposes a novel framework that formulates near-field channel estimation as a gridless super-resolution problem, eliminating the need for explicitly constructed codebooks. By employing a second-order approximation of spherical-wave steering vectors, the near-field channel is represented as a superposition of complex exponentials modulated by unknown waveforms. We demonstrate that these waveforms lie tightly in a common discrete chirp rate (DCR) subspace, with a dimension that scales as $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ for an $N$-element array. By leveraging this structure and applying a lifting technique, we reformulate the non-convex problem as a convex program using regularized atomic norm minimization, which admits an equivalent semidefinite program. From the solution to the convex program, we obtain gridless angle estimates and derive closed-form coarse range estimates, followed by refinement under the exact spherical model using gradient-based nonlinear least squares. The proposed method avoids basis mismatch and exhaustive two-dimensional grid searches while enabling accurate joint angle-range estimation with pilot budgets that scale sublinearly with array size in sparse multipath regimes. Simulations demonstrate accurate channel reconstruction and user localization across representative near-field scenarios.

Title: A Framework for Statistical Geometric Channel Model for ISAC Systems
Authors: Ali Waqar Azim, Ahmad Bazzi, Theodore S. Rappaport, Marwa Chafii
Abstract: This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for a geometry-based statistical model for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) tailored for bistatic systems. Our dual-component model decomposes the ISAC channel into a target channel encompassing all multipath components produced by a sensing target parameterized by the target's radar cross-section and scattering points, and a background channel comprising all other propagation paths that do not interact with the sensing target. The framework extends TR38.901 via a hybrid clustering approach, integrating spatiotemporally consistent deterministic clusters with stochastic clusters to preserve channel reciprocity and absolute delay alignment for sensing parameter estimation. Extensive simulations across urban macro, urban micro, and indoor factory scenarios demonstrate that the model maintains communication performance parity with the standard TR38.901, validated through bit-error rate analysis obtained via simulated and measured ISAC channels and channel capacity assessment, while enabling sensing performance evaluation, such as target ranging error for localization and receiver operating characteristic curves for detection probability.

Title: Deep Learning for Restoring MPI System Matrices Using Simulated Training Data
Authors: Artyom Tsanda, Sarah Reiss, Marija Boberg, Tobias Knopp
Abstract: Magnetic particle imaging reconstructs tracer distributions using a system matrix obtained through time-consuming, noise-prone calibration measurements. Methods for addressing imperfections in measured system matrices increasingly rely on deep neural networks, yet curated training data remain scarce. This study evaluates whether physics-based simulated system matrices can be used to train deep learning models for different system matrix restoration tasks, i.e., denoising, accelerated calibration, upsampling, and inpainting, that generalize to measured data. A large system matrices dataset was generated using an equilibrium magnetization model extended with uniaxial anisotropy. The dataset spans particle, scanner, and calibration parameters for 2D and 3D trajectories, and includes background noise injected from empty-frame measurements. For each restoration task, deep learning models were compared with classical non-learning baseline methods. The models trained solely on simulated system matrices generalized to measured data across all tasks: for denoising, DnCNN/RDN/SwinIR outperformed DCT-F baseline by >10 dB PSNR and up to 0.1 SSIM on simulations and led to perceptually better reconstuctions of real data; for 2D upsampling, SMRnet exceeded bicubic by 20 dB PSNR and 0.08 SSIM at $\times 2$-$\times 4$ which did not transfer qualitatively to real measurements. For 3D accelerated calibration, SMRnet matched tricubic in noiseless cases and was more robust under noise, and for 3D inpainting, biharmonic inpainting was superior when noise-free but degraded with noise, while a PConvUNet maintained quality and yielded less blurry reconstructions. The demonstrated transferability of deep learning models trained on simulations to real measurements mitigates the data-scarcity problem and enables the development of new methods beyond current measurement capabilities.

Title: Robust HRRP Recognition under Interrupted Sampling Repeater Jamming using a Prior Jamming Information-Guided Network
Authors: Guozheng Sun, Lei Wang, Yanhao Wang, Jie Wang, Yimin Liu
Abstract: Radar automatic target recognition (RATR) based on high-resolution range profile (HRRP) has attracted increasing attention due to its ability to capture fine-grained structural features. However, recognizing targets under electronic countermeasures (ECM), especially the mainstream interrupted-sampling repeater jamming (ISRJ), remains a significant challenge, as HRRPs often suffer from serious feature distortion. To address this, we propose a robust HRRP recognition method guided by prior jamming information. Specifically, we introduce a point spread function (PSF) as prior information to model the HRRP distortion induced by ISRJ. Based on this, we design a recognition network that leverages this prior through a prior-guided feature interaction module and a hybrid loss function to enhance the model's discriminative capability. With the aid of prior information, the model can learn invariant features within distorted HRRP under different jamming parameters. Both the simulated and measured-data experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and exhibits stronger generalization capabilities when facing unseen jamming parameters.

Title: Hierarchical Feature Integration for Multi-Signal Automatic Modulation Recognition
Authors: Yunpeng Qu, Yazhou Sun, Bingyu Hui, Jian Wang
Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is a crucial step in wireless communication systems, which identifies the modulation scheme from detected signals to provide key information for further processing. However, previous work has mainly focused on the identification of a single signal, overlooking the phenomenon of multiple signal superposition in practical channels and the signal detection procedures that must be conducted beforehand. Considering the susceptibility of radio frequency (RF) signals to noise interference and significant spectral variations, we propose a novel Hierarchical Feature Integration (HIFI)-YOLO framework for multi-signal joint detection and modulation recognition. Our HIFI-YOLO framework, with its unique design of hierarchical feature integration, effectively enhances the representation capability of features in different modules, thereby improving detection performance. We construct a large-scale AMR dataset specifically tailored for scenarios of the coexistence or overlapping of multiple signals transmitted through channels with realistic propagation conditions, consisting of diverse digital and analog modulation schemes. Extensive experiments on our dataset demonstrate the excellent performance of HIFI-YOLO in multi-signal detection and modulation recognition as a joint approach.

Title: Data-driven Reachability Verification with Probabilistic Guarantees under Koopman Spectral Uncertainty
Authors: Jianqiang Ding, Shankar A. Deka
Abstract: Providing rigorous reachability guarantees for unknown complex systems is a crucial and challenging task. In this paper, we present a novel data-driven framework that addresses this challenge by leveraging Koopman operator theory. Instead of operating in the state space, the proposed method encodes model uncertainty from finite data directly into Koopman spectral representation with quantifiable error bounds. Leveraging this spectral information, we systematically determine time intervals within which trajectories from the initial set are guaranteed, with a prescribed probability, to reach the target set. This enables the rigorous reachability verification without explicit computation of reachable sets, thereby offering a significant advantage in scalability and applicability. We finally validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through case studies on representative dynamical systems.

Title: Dynamic Power Allocation For NOMA-Based Transmission in 6G Optical Wireless Networks
Authors: Ahmad Adnan Qidan, Taisir El-Gorashi, Majid Safari, Harald Haas, Richard V. Penty, Ian H. White, Jaafar M. H. Elmirghani
Abstract: OWC has been considered as a key enabling technology to unlock unprecedented speeds of communication, supporting high demands of data traffic. In this paper, infrared lasers are used as optical transmitters operating in an indoor environment under eye safety regulations due to their high modulation speed. To provide efficient multiple access service, NOMA-based transmission is implemented to multiplex messages intended to multiple users in the power domain and maximize the spectral efficiency of our laser-based OWC network. In particular, a BIA outer precoder is designed to coordinate the transmission among multiple APs and determine the precoding matrices for groups of users potential formed according to NOMA principles. For effective use of NOMA, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum rate of the network through forming optimum groups under certain joint conditions, efficient power allocation, high quality of service for each weak and strong users, and high overall system performance. Such optimization problems are defined as max-min fractional programs difficult to solve in practice. Therefore, a dynamic application for NOMA is introduced using two algorithms. First, a RF-aided dynamic algorithm is designed to form multiple groups, where users exchange binary variables among them through an RF system to establish distance-based weight edges, which are used as a metric for the grouping process. Second, a dynamic power allocation is proposed to determine the optimum power allocated to each group, while the users belonging to a certain group receive their traffic demands regardless of their classification as weak or strong. The results show the convergence of the proposed dynamic application to the optimum solution, and its high performance in terms of sum rate, fairness, and energy efficiency compared to counterpart schemes.

Title: Compensation of correlated autoregressive clock jitter in arrays of Analog-to-Digital Converters
Authors: Daniele Gerosa, Lauri Anttila, Thomas Eriksson
Abstract: In modern communication systems, the fidelity of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) is limited by sampling clock jitter, i.e., small random timing deviations that undermine ideal sampling. Traditional scalar models often treat jitter as independent Gaussian noise, which makes it essentially untrackable, whereas real ADCs also exhibit temporally correlated (spectrally colored) imperfections. Moreover, spatial cross-correlations between channels in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ADCs are commonly neglected. This paper addresses the joint tracking and compensation of random, cross-correlated timing errors in ADC arrays by modeling jitter as a coupled vector autoregressive process of order one (VAR(1)). We propose a pilot-tone-based Kalman smoother to track and compensate the jitter, and simulations demonstrate substantial reductions in jitter-induced distortion across diverse scenarios.

Title: EMF-Compliant Power Control in Cell-Free Massive MIMO: Model-Based and Data-Driven Approaches
Authors: Sergi Liesegang, Stefano Buzzi
Abstract: The impressive growth of wireless data networks has recently led to increased attention to the issue of electromagnetic pollution and the fulfillment of electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure limits. This paper tackles the problem of power control in user-centric cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems under EMF constraints. Specifically, the power allocation maximizing the minimum data rate across users is derived for both the uplink and the downlink. To solve such optimization problems, two approaches are proposed, i.e., model-based and data-driven. The proposed model-based solutions for the downlink utilize successive convex optimization and the log-sum-exp approximation for the minimum of a discrete set, whereas ordinary techniques are employed for the uplink. With regard to data-driven solutions, solutions based on both end-to-end architectures and deep unfolding techniques are explored. Extensive numerical results confirm that the proposed model-based solutions effectively fulfill the EMF constraints while ensuring very good performance; moreover, the results show that the proposed data-driven approaches can tightly approximate the performance of model-based solutions but with much lower computational complexity.

Title: Strong nonlinear detectability and moving horizon estimation for nonlinear systems with unknown inputs
Authors: Yang Guo, Jaime A. Moreno, Stefan Streif
Abstract: This paper considers state estimation for general nonlinear discrete-time systems subject to measurement noise and possibly unbounded unknown inputs. To approach this problem, we first propose the concept of strong nonlinear detectability. This condition is sufficient and necessary for the existence of unknown input state estimators (UISEs), which reconstruct states from noisy sampled measurements and yield bounded estimation error even for unbounded unknown inputs. Based on the proposed detectability notion, a UISE is designed via a moving horizon estimation strategy using a full-order model as well as past and current measurements. Next, we tighten this detectability notion to design a two-stage MHE-based UISE, which is computationally more efficient than the MHE-based UISE using full-order models. In a simulation example with a plant growth process, both variants of MHE-based UISEs are compared with a conventional MHE to illustrate the merits of the developed methods.

Title: A Lyapunov-Based Small-Gain Theorem for Fixed-Time Stability

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Lyapunov-based small-gain methodology for establishing fixed-time stability (FxTS) guarantees in interconnected dynamical systems. Specifically, we consider interconnections in which each subsystem admits an individual fixed-time input-to-state stability (ISS) Lyapunov function that certifies FxT-ISS. We then show that if a nonlinear small-gain condition is satisfied, then the entire interconnected system is FxTS. Our results are analogous to existing Lyapunov-based small-gain theorems developed for asymptotic and finite-time stability, thereby filling an important gap in the stability analysis of interconnected dynamical systems. The proposed theoretical tools are further illustrated through analytical and numerical examples, including an application to fixed-time feedback optimization of dynamical systems without time-scale separation between the plant and the controller.

Title: Effective Hyper-clutter Artifacts Suppression for Ultrafast Ultrasound Doppler Imaging
Authors: Lijie Huang, Jingyi Yin, Jingke Zhang, U-Wai Lok, Ryan M. DeRuiter, Kaipeng Ji, Yanzhe Zhao, Tao Wu, James D. Krier, Xiang-yang Zhu, Andrew J. Bentall, Andrew D. Rule, Thomas D. Atwell, Lilach O. Lerman, Shigao Chen, Chengwu Huang
Abstract: Objective: Hyper-clutter artifacts (HCA), arising from strong tissue reflections or physiological motion, present persistent challenges in ultrafast ultrasound Doppler imaging, often obscuring surrounding small vessel flow signals, especially in fascial regions such as the renal capsule. This study proposes U-profile-based decluttering (UPBD), a robust and computationally efficient method that exploits singular value decomposition (SVD)-derived spatial singular vectors to suppress HCA in ultrafast Doppler imaging. Methods: UPBD analyzes intensity profile of each pixel along the singular-order dimension of the SVD-derived left singular vectors U. A pixel-wise clutter-energy ratio is computed to derive a spatially adaptive declutter weighting map, which is applied to the SVD-filtered flow signals. Results: UPBD was evaluated on multiple in vivo datasets. Quantitative assessments based on contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and contrast-to-tissue ratio (CTR) demonstrated significant improvements over conventional SVD filtering. For example, UPBD enhanced CTR from 7.3 dB to 21.7 dB in contrast-free pig kidney, 17.8 dB to 42.1 dB in contrast-enhanced pig kidney, 8.2 dB to 32.8 dB in human kidney, and -4.9 dB to 3.7 dB in 3D human liver. Conclusion: The proposed UPBD method effectively suppresses HCA while preserving blood flow signals with minimal extra computational cost and no need for extensive parameter tuning. Significance: UPBD serves as a lightweight, easily integrated post-processing method that enhances HCA suppression, enabling broader application of SVD-based ultrafast Doppler imaging.

Title: Advancing Marine Bioacoustics with Deep Generative Models: A Hybrid Augmentation Strategy for Southern Resident Killer Whale Detection
Authors: Bruno Padovese, Fabio Frazao, Michael Dowd, Ruth Joy
Abstract: Automated detection and classification of marine mammals vocalizations is critical for conservation and management efforts but is hindered by limited annotated datasets and the acoustic complexity of real-world marine environments. Data augmentation has proven to be an effective strategy to address this limitation by increasing dataset diversity and improving model generalization without requiring additional field data. However, most augmentation techniques used to date rely on effective but relatively simple transformations, leaving open the question of whether deep generative models can provide additional benefits. In this study, we evaluate the potential of deep generative for data augmentation in marine mammal call detection including: Variational Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks, and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models. Using Southern Resident Killer Whale (Orcinus orca) vocalizations from two long-term hydrophone deployments in the Salish Sea, we compare these approaches against traditional augmentation methods such as time-shifting and vocalization masking. While all generative approaches improved classification performance relative to the baseline, diffusion-based augmentation yielded the highest recall (0.87) and overall F1-score (0.75). A hybrid strategy combining generative-based synthesis with traditional methods achieved the best overall performance with an F1-score of 0.81. We hope this study encourages further exploration of deep generative models as complementary augmentation strategies to advance acoustic monitoring of threatened marine mammal populations.

Title: Secure Command, Control and Communications Systems (C3) for Army UxVs
Authors: T. Rebolo, A. Grilo, C. Ribeiro
Abstract: Unmanned Vehicles (UxVs) are increasingly used in modern military operations for reconnaissance, surveillance, and strike missions, enhancing situational awareness while reducing risk to personnel. Their affordability and rapid deployment have encouraged the adoption of commercial solutions. However, many rely on insecure protocols such as MAVLink, which lack authentication and encryption mechanisms. This paper designed, implemented, and evaluated a new secure command-and-control architecture that ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authentication (CIA) while supporting real-time control delegation between Ground Control Stations (GCSs). The proposed solution, named New Command and Control System (NC2S), enforces a zero-trust model integrating hierarchical credential-based privileges to regulate access and control among Tactical Commanders (TC), GCSs, and UxVs. It employs mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) with Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) certificates and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange, while message integrity is ensured through Hash-based Message Authentication Codes (HMAC). Multiple lightweight protocols were developed for credential management, key renewal, and control handover. The NC2S prototype was experimentally validated over Wi-Fi and Rohde&Schwarz HR-5000H tactical radios. Results showed that HR-5000H links introduce latencies roughly two orders of magnitude higher than broadband technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi or 5G&Beyond technologies) but are still able to maintain stable communication with minimal message loss, making them suitable for the NC2S links among TC terminals and GCSs.

Title: Deep Learning Architectures for Code-Modulated Visual Evoked Potentials Detection
Authors: Kiran Nair, Hubert Cecotti
Abstract: Non-invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) based on Code-Modulated Visual Evoked Potentials (C-VEPs) require highly robust decoding methods to address temporal variability and session-dependent noise in EEG signals. This study proposes and evaluates several deep learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for 63-bit m-sequence reconstruction and classification, and Siamese networks for similarity-based decoding, alongside canonical correlation analysis (CCA) baselines. EEG data were recorded from 13 healthy adults under single-target flicker stimulation. The proposed deep models significantly outperformed traditional approaches, with distance-based decoding using Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and constrained EMD showing greater robustness to latency variations than Euclidean and Mahalanobis metrics. Temporal data augmentation with small shifts further improved generalization across sessions. Among all models, the multi-class Siamese network achieved the best overall performance with an average accuracy of 96.89%, demonstrating the potential of data-driven deep architectures for reliable, single-trial C-VEP decoding in adaptive non-invasive BCI systems.

Title: MOTIF-RF: Multi-template On-chip Transformer Synthesis Incorporating Frequency-domain Self-transfer Learning for RFIC Design Automation
Authors: Houbo He, Yizhou Xu, Lei Xia, Yaolong Hu, Fan Cai, Taiyun Chi
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study on developing multi-template machine learning (ML) surrogate models and applying them to the inverse design of transformers (XFMRs) in radio-frequency integrated circuits (RFICs). Our study starts with benchmarking four widely used ML architectures, including MLP-, CNN-, UNet-, and GT-based models, using the same datasets across different XFMR topologies. To improve modeling accuracy beyond these baselines, we then propose a new frequency-domain self-transfer learning technique that exploits correlations between adjacent frequency bands, leading to around 30%-50% accuracy improvement in the S-parameters prediction. Building on these models, we further develop an inverse design framework based on the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm. This framework is validated using multiple impedance-matching tasks, all demonstrating fast convergence and trustworthy performance. These results advance the goal of AI-assisted specs-to-GDS automation for RFICs and provide RFIC designers with actionable tools for integrating AI into their workflows.

Title: SwordRiding: A Unified Navigation Framework for Quadrotors in Unknown Complex Environments via Online Guiding Vector Fields

Abstract: Although quadrotor navigation has achieved high performance in trajectory planning and control, real-time adaptability in unknown complex environments remains a core challenge. This difficulty mainly arises because most existing planning frameworks operate in an open-loop manner, making it hard to cope with environmental uncertainties such as wind disturbances or external perturbations. This paper presents a unified real-time navigation framework for quadrotors in unknown complex environments, based on the online construction of guiding vector fields (GVFs) from discrete reference path points. In the framework, onboard perception modules build a Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) representation of the environment, which enables obstacle awareness and path distance evaluation. The system first generates discrete, collision-free path points using a global planner, and then parameterizes them via uniform B-splines to produce a smooth and physically feasible reference trajectory. An adaptive GVF is then synthesized from the ESDF and the optimized B-spline trajectory. Unlike conventional approaches, the method adopts a closed-loop navigation paradigm, which significantly enhances robustness under external disturbances. Compared with conventional GVF methods, the proposed approach directly accommodates discretized paths and maintains compatibility with standard planning algorithms. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate improved robustness against external disturbances and superior real-time performance.

Title: AutoRec: Accelerating Loss Recovery for Live Streaming in a Multi-Supplier Market
Authors: Tong Li, Xu Yan, Bo Wu, Cheng Luo, Fuyu Wang, Jiuxiang Zhu, Haoyi Fang, Xinle Du, Ke Xu
Abstract: Due to the limited permissions for upgrading dualside (i.e., server-side and client-side) loss tolerance schemes from the perspective of CDN vendors in a multi-supplier market, modern large-scale live streaming services are still using the automatic-repeat-request (ARQ) based paradigm for loss recovery, which only requires server-side modifications. In this paper, we first conduct a large-scale measurement study with up to 50 million live streams. We find that loss shows dynamics and live streaming contains frequent on-off mode switching in the wild. We further find that the recovery latency, enlarged by the ubiquitous retransmission loss, is a critical factor affecting live streaming's client-side QoE (e.g., video freezing). We then propose an enhanced recovery mechanism called AutoRec, which can transform the disadvantages of on-off mode switching into an advantage for reducing loss recovery latency without any modifications on the client side. AutoRec allows users to customize overhead tolerance and recovery latency tolerance and adaptively adjusts strategies as the network environment changes to ensure that recovery latency meets user demands whenever possible while keeping overhead under control. We implement AutoRec upon QUIC and evaluate it via testbed and real-world commercial services deployments. The experimental results demonstrate the practicability and profitability of AutoRec.

Title: Density-based Neural Temporal Point Processes for Heartbeat Dynamics
Authors: Sandya Subramanian, Bharath Ramsundar
Abstract: Temporal point processes (TPPs) provide a natural mathematical framework for modeling heartbeats due to capturing underlying physiological inductive biases. In this work, we apply density-based neural TPPs to model heartbeat dynamics from 18 subjects. We adapt a goodness-of-fit framework from classical point process literature to Neural TPPs and use it to optimize hyperparameters, identify appropriate training sequence lengths to capture temporal dependencies, and demonstrate zero-shot predictive capability on heartbeat data.

Title: Model Predictive Path Planning in Navier-Stokes Flow with POD-Based Reduced-Order Models
Authors: Adam Waterman, Martin Guay
Abstract: We present a framework for optimal trajectory generation in flow-driven systems governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, combining a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) reduced0order model (ROM) with Model Predictive Control (MPC). The approach (i) approximates the velocity field from data via snapshot POD and orthogonal projection, (ii) derives a Galerkin-projected dynamical model in reduced coordinates, and (iii) employs MPC to plan control inputs that steer an agent through the predicted flow while satisfying state and actuation constraints. By leveraging reduced-order modeling, the method enables real-time control in high-dimensional flow environments. Simulations demonstrate accurate flow-field reconstruction and efficient trajectory generation within realistic wind environments.

Title: SemOD: Semantic Enabled Object Detection Network under Various Weather Conditions
Authors: Aiyinsi Zuo, Zhaoliang Zheng
Abstract: In the field of autonomous driving, camera-based perception models are mostly trained on clear weather data. Models that focus on addressing specific weather challenges are unable to adapt to various weather changes and primarily prioritize their weather removal characteristics. Our study introduces a semantic-enabled network for object detection in diverse weather conditions. In our analysis, semantics information can enable the model to generate plausible content for missing areas, understand object boundaries, and preserve visual coherency and realism across both filled-in and existing portions of the image, which are conducive to image transformation and object recognition. Specific in implementation, our architecture consists of a Preprocessing Unit (PPU) and a Detection Unit (DTU), where the PPU utilizes a U-shaped net enriched by semantics to refine degraded images, and the DTU integrates this semantic information for object detection using a modified YOLO network. Our method pioneers the use of semantic data for all-weather transformations, resulting in an increase between 1.47\% to 8.80\% in mAP compared to existing methods across benchmark datasets of different weather. This highlights the potency of semantics in image enhancement and object detection, offering a comprehensive approach to improving object detection performance.

Title: GLA-Grad++: An Improved Griffin-Lim Guided Diffusion Model for Speech Synthesis
Authors: Teysir Baoueb, Xiaoyu Bie, Mathieu Fontaine, Gaël Richard
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have positioned them as powerful generative frameworks for speech synthesis, demonstrating substantial improvements in audio quality and stability. Nevertheless, their effectiveness in vocoders conditioned on mel spectrograms remains constrained, particularly when the conditioning diverges from the training distribution. The recently proposed GLA-Grad model introduced a phase-aware extension to the WaveGrad vocoder that integrated the Griffin-Lim algorithm (GLA) into the reverse process to reduce inconsistencies between generated signals and conditioning mel spectrogram. In this paper, we further improve GLA-Grad through an innovative choice in how to apply the correction. Particularly, we compute the correction term only once, with a single application of GLA, to accelerate the generation process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the baseline models, particularly in out-of-domain scenarios.

Title: Nonholonomic Narrow Dead-End Escape with Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Denghan Xiong, Yanzhe Zhao, Yutong Chen, Zichun Wang
Abstract: Nonholonomic constraints restrict feasible velocities without reducing configuration-space dimension, which makes collision-free geometric paths generally non-executable for car-like robots. Ackermann steering further imposes curvature bounds and forbids in-place rotation, so escaping from narrow dead ends typically requires tightly sequenced forward and reverse maneuvers. Classical planners that decouple global search and local steering struggle in these settings because narrow passages occupy low-measure regions and nonholonomic reachability shrinks the set of valid connections, which degrades sampling efficiency and increases sensitivity to clearances. We study nonholonomic narrow dead-end escape for Ackermann vehicles and contribute three components. First, we construct a generator that samples multi-phase forward-reverse trajectories compatible with Ackermann kinematics and inflates their envelopes to synthesize families of narrow dead ends that are guaranteed to admit at least one feasible escape. Second, we construct a training environment that enforces kinematic constraints and train a policy using the soft actor-critic algorithm. Third, we evaluate against representative classical planners that combine global search with nonholonomic steering. Across parameterized dead-end families, the learned policy solves a larger fraction of instances, reduces maneuver count, and maintains comparable path length and planning time while under the same sensing and control limits. We provide our project as open source at this https URL

Title: Test Time Training for AC Power Flow Surrogates via Physics and Operational Constraint Refinement
Authors: Panteleimon Dogoulis, Mohammad Iman Alizadeh, Sylvain Kubler, Maxime Cordy
Abstract: Power Flow (PF) calculation based on machine learning (ML) techniques offer significant computational advantages over traditional numerical methods but often struggle to maintain full physical consistency. This paper introduces a physics-informed test-time training (PI-TTT) framework that enhances the accuracy and feasibility of ML-based PF surrogates by enforcing AC power flow equalities and operational constraints directly at inference time. The proposed method performs a lightweight self-supervised refinement of the surrogate outputs through few gradient-based updates, enabling local adaptation to unseen operating conditions without requiring labeled data. Extensive experiments on the IEEE 14-, 118-, and 300-bus systems and the PEGASE 1354-bus network show that PI-TTT reduces power flow residuals and operational constraint violations by one to two orders of magnitude compared with purely ML-based models, while preserving their computational advantage. The results demonstrate that PI-TTT provides fast, accurate, and physically reliable predictions, representing a promising direction for scalable and physics-consistent learning in power system analysis.

Title: Improving Stochastic Action-Constrained Reinforcement Learning via Truncated Distributions
Authors: Roland Stolz, Michael Eichelbeck, Matthias Althoff
Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), it is often advantageous to consider additional constraints on the action space to ensure safety or action relevance. Existing work on such action-constrained RL faces challenges regarding effective policy updates, computational efficiency, and predictable runtime. Recent work proposes to use truncated normal distributions for stochastic policy gradient methods. However, the computation of key characteristics, such as the entropy, log-probability, and their gradients, becomes intractable under complex constraints. Hence, prior work approximates these using the non-truncated distributions, which severely degrades performance. We argue that accurate estimation of these characteristics is crucial in the action-constrained RL setting, and propose efficient numerical approximations for them. We also provide an efficient sampling strategy for truncated policy distributions and validate our approach on three benchmark environments, which demonstrate significant performance improvements when using accurate estimations.

Title: Joint Speech and Text Training for LLM-Based End-to-End Spoken Dialogue State Tracking
Authors: Katia Vendrame, Bolaji Yusuf, Santosh Kesiraju, Šimon Sedláček, Oldřich Plchot, Jan Černocký
Abstract: End-to-end spoken dialogue state tracking (DST) is made difficult by the tandem of having to handle speech input and data scarcity. Combining speech foundation encoders and large language models has been proposed in recent work as to alleviate some of this difficulty. Although this approach has been shown to result in strong spoken DST models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in realistic multi-turn DST, it struggles to generalize across domains and requires annotated spoken DST training data for each domain of interest. However, collecting such data for every target domain is both costly and difficult. Noting that textual DST data is more easily obtained for various domains, in this work, we propose jointly training on available spoken DST data and written textual data from other domains as a way to achieve cross-domain generalization. We conduct experiments which show the efficacy of our proposed method for getting good cross-domain DST performance without relying on spoken training data from the target domains.

Title: PURE Codec: Progressive Unfolding of Residual Entropy for Speech Codec Learning
Authors: Jiatong Shi, Haoran Wang, William Chen, Chenda Li, Wangyou Zhang, Jinchuan Tian, Shinji Watanabe
Abstract: Neural speech codecs have achieved strong performance in low-bitrate compression, but residual vector quantization (RVQ) often suffers from unstable training and ineffective decomposition, limiting reconstruction quality and efficiency. We propose PURE Codec (Progressive Unfolding of Residual Entropy), a novel framework that guides multi-stage quantization using a pre-trained speech enhancement model. The first quantization stage reconstructs low-entropy, denoised speech embeddings, while subsequent stages encode residual high-entropy components. This design improves training stability significantly. Experiments demonstrate that PURE consistently outperforms conventional RVQ-based codecs in reconstruction and downstream speech language model-based text-to-speech, particularly under noisy training conditions.

Title: A Two Degrees-of-Freedom Floor-Based Robot for Transfer and Rehabilitation Applications
Authors: Ian Lalonde, Jeff Denis, Mathieu Lamy, Camille Martin, Karina Lebel, Alexandre Girard
Abstract: The ability to accomplish a sit-to-stand (STS) motion is key to increase functional mobility and reduce rehospitalization risks. While raising aid (transfer) devices and partial bodyweight support (rehabilitation) devices exist, both are unable to adjust the STS training to different mobility levels. Therefore, We have developed an STS training device that allows various configurations of impedance and vertical/forward forces to adapt to many training needs while maintaining commercial raising aid transfer capabilities. Experiments with healthy adults (both men and women) of various heights and weights show that the device 1) has a low impact on the natural STS kinematics, 2) can provide precise weight unloading at the patient's center of mass and 3) can add a forward virtual spring to assist the transfer of the bodyweight to the feet for seat-off, at the start of the STS motion.

Title: A lasso-alternative to Dijkstra's algorithm for identifying short paths in networks
Authors: Anqi Dong, Amirhossein Taghvaei, Tryphon T. Georgiou
Abstract: We revisit the problem of finding the shortest path between two selected vertices of a graph and formulate this as an $\ell_1$-regularized regression -- Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (lasso). We draw connections between a numerical implementation of this lasso-formulation, using the so-called LARS algorithm, and a more established algorithm known as the bi-directional Dijkstra. Appealing features of our formulation include the applicability of the Alternating Direction of Multiplier Method (ADMM) to the problem to identify short paths, and a relatively efficient update to topological changes.

Title: Can industrial overcapacity enable seasonal flexibility in electricity use? A case study of aluminum smelting in China
Authors: Ruike Lyu, Anna Li, Jianxiao Wang, Hongxi Luo, Yan Shen, Hongye Guo, Ershun Du, Chongqing Kang, Jesse Jenkins
Abstract: In many countries, declining demand in energy-intensive industries (EIIs) such as cement, steel, and aluminum is leading to industrial overcapacity. Although overcapacity is traditionally seen as problematic, it could unlock EIIs' flexibility in electricity use. Using China's aluminum smelting sector as a case, we evaluate the system-level cost-benefit of retaining EII overcapacity for flexible electricity use in decarbonized systems. We find that overcapacity enables smelters to adopt a seasonal operation paradigm, ceasing production during winter load peaks driven by heating electrification and renewable seasonality. In a 2050-net-zero scenario, this paradigm reduces China's electricity-system investment and operating costs by 15-72 billion CNY per year (8-34% of the industry's product value), enough to offset the costs of maintaining overcapacity and product storage. Seasonal operation also cuts workforce fluctuations across aluminum smelting and thermal-power sectors by up to 62%, potentially mitigating socio-economic disruptions from industrial restructuring and the energy transition.

Title: CO-QLink: Cryogenic Optical Link for Scalable Quantum Computing Systems and High-Performance Cryogenic Computing Systems
Authors: Zheng Chang, Siqi Zhang, Wenqiang Huang, Tian Tian, Qichun Liu, Tiefu Li, Nan Qi, Yuanjin Zheng, Zhihua Wang, Yanshu Guo, Hanjun Jiang
Abstract: Cryogenic systems necessitate extensive data transmission between room-temperature and cryogenic environments, as well as within the cryogenic temperature domain. High-speed, low-power data transmission is pivotal to enabling the deployment of larger-scale cryogenic systems, including the scalable quantum computing systems and the high-performance cryogenic computing systems fully immersed in liquid nitrogen. In contrast to wireline and microwave links, optical communication links are emerging as a solution characterized by high data rates, high energy efficiency, low signal attenuation, absence of thermal conduction, and superior scalability. In this work, a 4K heat-insulated high-speed (56Gbps) low-power (1.6pJ/b) transceiver (TRX) that achieves a complete link between 4K systems and room temperature (RT) equipment is presented. Copackaged with a PIN photodiode (PD), the RX uses an inverter-based analog front-end and an analog half-rate clock data recovery loop. Connecting to a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM), the TX contains a voltage-mode driver with current-mode injection for low-power output-swing-boosting and 3-tap feed-forward equalization (FFE). This link has been demonstrated in the control and readout of a complete superconducting quantum computing system.

Title: Automated Discovery of Laser Dicing Processes with Bayesian Optimization for Semiconductor Manufacturing
Authors: David Leeftink, Roman Doll, Heleen Visserman, Marco Post, Faysal Boughorbel, Max Hinne, Marcel van Gerven
Abstract: Laser dicing of semiconductor wafers is a critical step in microelectronic manufacturing, where multiple sequential laser passes precisely separate individual dies from the wafer. Adapting this complex sequential process to new wafer materials typically requires weeks of expert effort to balance process speed, separation quality, and material integrity. We present the first automated discovery of production-ready laser dicing processes on an industrial LASER1205 dicing system. We formulate the problem as a high-dimensional, constrained multi-objective Bayesian optimization task, and introduce a sequential two-level fidelity strategy to minimize expensive destructive die-strength evaluations. On bare silicon and product wafers, our method autonomously delivers feasible configurations that match or exceed expert baselines in production speed, die strength, and structural integrity, using only technician-level operation. Post-hoc validation of different weight configurations of the utility functions reveals that multiple feasible solutions with qualitatively different trade-offs can be obtained from the final surrogate model. Expert-refinement of the discovered process can further improve production speed while preserving die strength and structural integrity, surpassing purely manual or automated methods.

Title: Fault-Tolerant MARL for CAVs under Observation Perturbations for Highway On-Ramp Merging
Authors: Yuchen Shi, Huaxin Pei, Yi Zhang, Danya Yao
Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) holds significant promise for enabling cooperative driving among Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs). However, its practical application is hindered by a critical limitation, i.e., insufficient fault tolerance against observational faults. Such faults, which appear as perturbations in the vehicles' perceived data, can substantially compromise the performance of MARL-based driving systems. Addressing this problem presents two primary challenges. One is to generate adversarial perturbations that effectively stress the policy during training, and the other is to equip vehicles with the capability to mitigate the impact of corrupted observations. To overcome the challenges, we propose a fault-tolerant MARL method for cooperative on-ramp vehicles incorporating two key agents. First, an adversarial fault injection agent is co-trained to generate perturbations that actively challenge and harden the vehicle policies. Second, we design a novel fault-tolerant vehicle agent equipped with a self-diagnosis capability, which leverages the inherent spatio-temporal correlations in vehicle state sequences to detect faults and reconstruct credible observations, thereby shielding the policy from misleading inputs. Experiments in a simulated highway merging scenario demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline MARL approaches, achieving near-fault-free levels of safety and efficiency under various observation fault patterns.

Title: Heteroscedastic Neural Networks for Path Loss Prediction with Link-Specific Uncertainty
Authors: Jonathan Ethier
Abstract: Traditional and modern machine learning-based path loss models typically assume a constant prediction variance. We propose a neural network that jointly predicts the mean and link-specific variance by minimizing a Gaussian negative log-likelihood, enabling heteroscedastic uncertainty estimates. We compare shared, partially shared, and independent-parameter architectures using accuracy, calibration, and sharpness metrics on blind test sets from large public RF drive-test datasets. The shared-parameter architecture performs best, achieving an RMSE of 7.4 dB, 95.1 percent coverage for 95 percent prediction intervals, and a mean interval width of 29.6 dB. These uncertainty estimates further support link-specific coverage margins, improve RF planning and interference analyses, and provide effective self-diagnostics of model weaknesses.

Title: Distributed Dynamic Associative Memory via Online Convex Optimization
Authors: Bowen Wang, Matteo Zecchin, Osvaldo Simeone
Abstract: An associative memory (AM) enables cue-response recall, and it has recently been recognized as a key mechanism underlying modern neural architectures such as Transformers. In this work, we introduce the concept of distributed dynamic associative memory (DDAM), which extends classical AM to settings with multiple agents and time-varying data streams. In DDAM, each agent maintains a local AM that must not only store its own associations but also selectively memorize information from other agents based on a specified interest matrix. To address this problem, we propose a novel tree-based distributed online gradient descent algorithm, termed DDAM-TOGD, which enables each agent to update its memory on the fly via inter-agent communication over designated routing trees. We derive rigorous performance guarantees for DDAM-TOGD, proving sublinear static regret in stationary environments and a path-length dependent dynamic regret bound in non-stationary environments. These theoretical results provide insights into how communication delays and network structure impact performance. Building on the regret analysis, we further introduce a combinatorial tree design strategy that optimizes the routing trees to minimize communication delays, thereby improving regret bounds. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed DDAM-TOGD framework achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to representative online learning baselines such as consensus-based distributed optimization, confirming the benefits of the proposed approach in dynamic, distributed environments.

Title: Quantum Private Distributed Matrix Multiplication With Degree Tables
Authors: Mohamed Nomeir, Alptug Aytekin, Lei Hu, Sennur Ulukus
Abstract: In this paper, we explore how quantum resources can be used to increase the rate of private distributed matrix multiplication (PDMM). In PDMM, a user who has two high-dimensional matrices, $A$ and $B$, and lacks the computational capabilities to apply matrix multiplication locally, divides the matrices $A$ and $B$ into $K$ and $L$ sub-blocks, respectively. Then, the user sends them to $N$ servers to apply the required multiplication privately from any $T$ servers. The goal is to reduce the number of servers needed to perform the required matrix multiplication. In the quantum setting, we allow the servers to share an entangled state and respond over quantum channels. Upon receiving the qudits, the user applies measurements to obtain the required multiplication. There are two main regimes in the PDMM literature: The high-privacy regime and the low-privacy regime where $T$ is less than $K$ and $L$. First, in the high-privacy regime, the state-of-the-art classical code is called the gap additive secure polynomial (GASP) code. We define a feasibility requirement in the quantum setting for the GASP code such that the highest performance is achieved when it is satisfied. When it is not satisfied, we address two main concerns. The first is to find a relation between the minimum privacy requirement and the dimensions of the two matrices needed for the feasibility condition to be satisfied. Second, we develop a new family of codes that can work in the quantum setting. Second, since GASP does not work efficiently in the low-privacy regimes compared to cyclic-addition degree tables (CAT) and discretely optimized GASP (DOG), we show that the feasibility condition developed for GASP can be adopted for both CAT and DOG codes as well. In addition, we propose another set of codes that can be used in the low privacy regime in the quantum setting when the feasibility requirement is not satisfied.

Title: Fast Gradient Methods for Data-Consistent Local Super-Resolution of Medical Images
Authors: Junqi Tang, Guixian Xu, Jinglai Li
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new paradigm of iterative model-based reconstruction algorithms for providing real-time solution for zooming-in and refining a region of interest in medical and clinical tomographic images. This algorithmic framework is tailored for a clinical need in medical imaging practice that after a reconstruction of the full tomographic image, the clinician may believe that some critical parts of the image are not clear enough, and may wish to see clearer these regions of interest. A naive approach (which is highly not recommended) would be to perform the global reconstruction of a higher resolution image, which has two major limitations: first, it is computationally inefficient, and second, the image regularization is still applied globally, which may over-smooth some local regions. Furthermore, if one wishes to fine-tune the regularization parameter for local parts, it would be computationally infeasible in practice for the case of using global reconstruction. Our new iterative approaches for such tasks are based on jointly utilizing the measurement information, efficient up-sampling/down-sampling across image spaces, and locally adjusted image prior for efficient and high-quality post-processing. The numerical results in low-dose X-ray CT image local zoom-in demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Title: Antifragile Perimeter Control: Anticipating and Gaining from Disruptions with Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Linghang Sun, Michail A. Makridis, Alexander Genser, Cristian Axenie, Margherita Grossi, Anastasios Kouvelas
Abstract: The optimal operation of transportation systems is often susceptible to unexpected disruptions, such as traffic accidents and social events. Many established control strategies reliant on mathematical models can struggle with real-world disruptions, leading to significant divergence from their anticipated efficiency. This work fuses the cutting-edge concept of antifragility into the design of a learning-based traffic control strategy for large-scale urban road networks to perform against disruptions. Antifragility sets itself apart from robustness, resilience, and reliability as it represents a system's ability to not only withstand stressors, shocks, and volatility but also to thrive and enhance performance in the presence of such adversarial events. Incorporating antifragile modules composed of traffic state derivatives and redundancy, a model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm is developed and subsequently evaluated in a two-region cordon-shaped urban traffic perimeter network, and a numerical case study based on real-world data. Promising results highlight (1) the superior performance of the proposed algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art methods under incremental magnitude of disruptions, (2) distribution skewness as the antifragility indicator demonstrating its relative antifragility, (3) its effectiveness under limited observability due to real-world data availability constraints, and (4) robustness of the proposed antifragile module when embedded into advanced RL algorithms for superior performance. The proposed antifragile methodology is generalizable and holds potential for applications beyond perimeter control, offering integration into systems exposed to disruptions across various disciplines.

Title: Comparison Performance of Spectrogram and Scalogram as Input of Acoustic Recognition Task
Authors: Dang Thoai Phan
Abstract: Acoustic recognition has emerged as a prominent task in deep learning research, frequently utilizing spectral feature extraction techniques such as the spectrogram from the Short-Time Fourier Transform and the scalogram from the Wavelet Transform. However, there is a notable deficiency in studies that comprehensively discuss the advantages, drawbacks, and performance comparisons of these methods. This paper aims to evaluate the characteristics of these two transforms as input data for acoustic recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks. The performance of the trained models employing both transforms is documented for comparison. Through this analysis, the paper elucidates the advantages and limitations of each method, provides insights into their respective application scenarios, and identifies potential directions for further research.

Title: Reduce Computational Complexity for Continuous Wavelet Transform in Acoustic Recognition Using Hop Size
Authors: Dang Thoai Phan
Abstract: In recent years, the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) has been employed as a spectral feature extractor for acoustic recognition tasks in conjunction with machine learning and deep learning models. However, applying the CWT to each individual audio sample is computationally intensive. This paper proposes an approach that applies the CWT to a subset of samples, spaced according to a specified hop size. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining the robust performance of the trained models.

Title: Open-/Closed-loop Active Learning for Data-driven Predictive Control
Authors: Shilun Feng, Dawei Shi, Yang Shi, Kaikai Zheng
Abstract: An important question in data-driven control is how to obtain an informative dataset. In this work, we consider the problem of effective data acquisition of an unknown linear system with bounded disturbance for both open-loop and closed-loop stages. The learning objective is to minimize the volume of the set of admissible systems. First, a performance measure based on historical data and the input sequence is introduced to characterize the upper bound of the volume of the set of admissible systems. On the basis of this performance measure, an open-loop active learning strategy is proposed to minimize the volume by actively designing inputs during the open-loop stage. For the closed-loop stage, a closed-loop active learning strategy is designed to select and learn from informative closed-loop data. The efficiency of the proposed closed-loop active learning strategy is proved by showing that the unselected data cannot benefit the learning performance. Furthermore, an adaptive predictive controller is designed in accordance with the proposed data acquisition approach. The recursive feasibility and the stability of the controller are proved by analyzing the effect of the closed-loop active learning strategy. Finally, numerical examples and comparisons illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed data acquisition strategy.

Title: State-of-the-art Embeddings with Video-free Segmentation of the Source VoxCeleb Data
Authors: Sara Barahona, Ladislav Mošner, Themos Stafylakis, Oldřich Plchot, Junyi Peng, Lukáš Burget, Jan Černocký
Abstract: In this paper, we refine and validate our method for training speaker embedding extractors using weak annotations. More specifically, we use only the audio stream of the source VoxCeleb videos and the names of the celebrities without knowing the time intervals in which they appear in the recording. We experiment with hyperparameters and embedding extractors based on ResNet and WavLM. We show that the method achieves state-of-the-art results in speaker verification, comparable with training the extractors in a standard supervised way on the VoxCeleb dataset. We also extend it by considering segments belonging to unknown speakers appearing alongside the celebrities, which are typically discarded. Removing the need for speaker timestamps and multimodal alignment, our method unlocks the use of large-scale weakly labeled speech data, enabling direct training of state-of-the-art embedding extractors and offering a visual-free alternative to VoxCeleb-style dataset creation.

Title: Time-to-reach Bounds for Verification of Dynamical Systems Using the Koopman Spectrum
Authors: Jianqiang Ding, Shankar A. Deka
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel Koopman spectrum-based reachability verification method for nonlinear systems. Contrary to conventional methods that focus on characterizing all potential states of a dynamical system over a presupposed time span, our approach seeks to verify the reachability by assessing the non-emptiness of estimated time-to-reach intervals without engaging in the explicit computation of reachable set. Based on the spectral analysis of the Koopman operator, we reformulate the problem of verifying existence of reachable trajectories into the problem of determining feasible time-to-reach bounds required for system reachability. By solving linear programming (LP) problems, our algorithm can effectively estimate all potential time intervals during which a dynamical system can enter (and exit) target sets from given initial sets over an unbounded time horizon. Finally, we demonstrate our method in challenging settings, such as verifying the reachability between non-convex or even disconnected sets, as well as backward reachability and multiple entries into target sets. Additionally, we validate its applicability in addressing real-world challenges and scalability to high-dimensional systems through case studies in verifying the reachability of the cart-pole and multi-agent consensus systems.

Title: L4acados: Learning-based models for acados, applied to Gaussian process-based predictive control
Authors: Amon Lahr, Joshua Näf, Kim P. Wabersich, Jonathan Frey, Pascal Siehl, Andrea Carron, Moritz Diehl, Melanie N. Zeilinger
Abstract: Incorporating learning-based models, such as artificial neural networks or Gaussian processes, into model predictive control (MPC) strategies can significantly improve control performance and online adaptation capabilities for real-world applications. Still, enabling state-of-the-art implementations of learning-based models for MPC is complicated by the challenge of interfacing machine learning frameworks with real-time optimal control software. This work aims at filling this gap by incorporating external sensitivities in sequential quadratic programming solvers for nonlinear optimal control. To this end, we provide L4acados, a general framework for incorporating Python-based dynamics models in the real-time optimal control software acados. By computing external sensitivities via a user-defined Python module, L4acados enables the implementation of MPC controllers with learning-based residual models in acados, while supporting parallelization of sensitivity computations when preparing the quadratic subproblems. We demonstrate significant speed-ups and superior scaling properties of L4acados compared to available software using a neural-network-based control example. Last, we provide an efficient and modular real-time implementation of Gaussian process-based MPC using L4acados, which is applied to two hardware examples: autonomous miniature racing, as well as motion control of a full-scale autonomous vehicle for an ISO lane change maneuver.

Title: Integrating Semantic Communication and Human Decision-Making into an End-to-End Sensing-Decision Framework
Authors: Edgar Beck, Hsuan-Yu Lin, Patrick Rückert, Yongping Bao, Bettina von Helversen, Sebastian Fehrler, Kirsten Tracht, Armin Dekorsy
Abstract: As early as 1949, Weaver defined communication in a very broad sense to include all procedures by which one mind or technical system can influence another, thus establishing the idea of semantic communication. With the recent success of machine learning in expert assistance systems where sensed information is wirelessly provided to a human to assist task execution, the need to design effective and efficient communications has become increasingly apparent. In particular, semantic communication aims to convey the meaning behind the sensed information relevant for Human Decision-Making (HDM). Regarding the interplay between semantic communication and HDM, many questions remain, such as how to model the entire end-to-end sensing-decision-making process, how to design semantic communication for the HDM and which information should be provided for HDM. To address these questions, we propose to integrate semantic communication and HDM into one probabilistic end-to-end sensing-decision framework that bridges communications and psychology. In our interdisciplinary framework, we model the human through a HDM process, allowing us to explore how feature extraction from semantic communication can best support HDM both in theory and in simulations. In this sense, our study reveals the fundamental design trade-off between maximizing the relevant semantic information and matching the cognitive capabilities of the HDM model. Our initial analysis shows how semantic communication can balance the level of detail with human cognitive capabilities while demanding less bandwidth, power, and latency.

Title: Fixed-Time Input-to-State Stability for Singularly Perturbed Systems via Composite Lyapunov Functions
Authors: Michael Tang, Miroslav Krstic, Jorge Poveda
Abstract: We study singularly perturbed systems that exhibit input-to-state stability (ISS) with fixed-time properties in the presence of bounded disturbances. In these systems, solutions converge to the origin within a time frame independent of initial conditions when undisturbed, and to a vicinity of the origin when subjected to bounded disturbances. First, we extend the traditional composite Lyapunov method, commonly applied in singular perturbation theory to analyze asymptotic stability, to include fixed-time ISS. We demonstrate that if both the reduced system and the boundary layer system exhibit fixed-time ISS, and if certain interconnection conditions are met, the entire multi-time scale system retains this fixed-time ISS characteristic, provided the separation of time scales is sufficiently pronounced. Next, we illustrate our findings via analytical and numerical examples, including a novel application in fixed-time feedback optimization for dynamic plants with slowly varying cost functions.

Authors: Cody Buehner, Sharaf K. Magableh, Oraib Dawaghreh, Caisheng Wang
Abstract: This paper explores the solutions for minimizing renewable energy (RE) curtailment in the Texas Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid. By utilizing current and future planning data from ERCOT and the System Advisor Model from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, we examine how future renewable energy (RE) initiatives, combined with utility-scale energy storage, can reduce CO2 emissions while reshaping Texas's energy mix. The study projects the energy landscape from 2023 to 2033, considering the planned phase-out of fossil fuel plants and the integration of new wind/solar projects. By comparing emissions under different load scenarios, with and without storage, we demonstrate storage's role in optimizing RE utilization. The findings of this paper provide actionable guidance for energy stakeholders, underscoring the need to expand wind and solar projects with strategic storage solutions to maximize Texas's RE capacity and substantially reduce CO2 emissions.

Title: Balancing Speech Understanding and Generation Using Continual Pre-training for Codec-based Speech LLM
Authors: Jiatong Shi, Chunlei Zhang, Jinchuan Tian, Junrui Ni, Hao Zhang, Shinji Watanabe, Dong Yu
Abstract: Recent advances in speech language models (LLMs) have extended textual LLMs to the speech domain, but balancing speech understanding and generation remains challenging, especially with codec-based representations. We propose a continual pre-training (CPT) framework that adapts a textual LLM to handle codec-discretized speech, mitigating modality mismatch and preserving linguistic reasoning. Our unified model supports both understanding and generation, achieving strong results across ASR, TTS, S2T-Trans, and S2S-Trans. Notably, we present the first end-to-end, single-pass S2S-Trans system using only neural codec tokens, without intermediate transcriptions, translations, or semantic tokens. CPT proves essential for cross-modal alignment and task generalization, making it a powerful tool for building robust, unified speech LLMs.

Title: Assessing the Performance and Impact of PV Technologies on Storage in Hybrid Renewable Systems
Authors: Sharaf K. Magableh, Oraib Dawaghreh, Xuesong Wang, Caisheng Wang
Abstract: Traditional monofacial photovoltaic (mPV) systems are commonly adopted and well-documented because of their lower upfront costs in comparison to bifacial photovoltaic (bPV) systems. This study investigates how PV technologies impact energy storage in grid-scale hybrid renewable systems, focusing on optimizing and assessing the performance of mPV and bPV technologies integrated with pumped storage hydropower. Using Ludington City, Michigan as a case study and analyzing realworld data such as solar irradiance, ambient temperature, and utility-scale load profiles, the research highlights the operational and economic benefits of bPV systems. The results reveal that bPV systems can pump approximately 10.38% more water annually to the upper reservoir while achieving a lower levelized cost of energy ($0.0578/kWh for bPV vs. $0.0672/kWh for mPV). This study underscores the outstanding potential of bPV systems in enhancing energy storage and management strategies, contributing to a more sustainable and resilient renewable energy future.

Title: Adaptive Subarray Segmentation: A New Paradigm of Spatial Non-Stationary Near-Field Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO Systems
Authors: Shuhang Yang, Puguang An, Peng Yang, Xianbin Cao, Dapeng Oliver Wu, Tony Q. S. Quek
Abstract: To address the complexities of spatial non-stationary (SnS) effects and spherical wave propagation in near-field channel estimation (CE) for extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems, this paper proposes an SnS-aware CE framework based on adaptive subarray partitioning. We first investigate spherical wave propagation and various SnS characteristics and construct an SnS near-field channel model for XL-MIMO systems. Due to the limitations of uniform array partitioning in capturing SnS, we analyze the adverse effects of the non-ideal array segmentation (over- and under-segmentation) on CE accuracy. To counter these issues, we develop a dynamic hybrid beamforming-assisted power-based subarray segmentation paradigm (DHBF-PSSP), which integrates power measurements with a dynamic hybrid beamforming structure to enable joint subarray partitioning and decoupling. A power-adaptive subarray segmentation (PASS) algorithm leverages the statistical properties of power profiles, while subarray decoupling is achieved via a subarray segmentation-based sampling method (SS-SM) under radio frequency (RF) chain constraints. For subarray CE, we propose a subarray segmentation-based assorted block sparse Bayesian learning algorithm under the multiple measurement vectors framework (SS-ABSBL-MMV). This algorithm exploits angular-domain block sparsity under a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook and inter-subcarrier structured sparsity. Simulation results confirm that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods in CE performance.

Title: Categorical Unsupervised Variational Acoustic Clustering
Authors: Luan Vinícius Fiorio, Ivana Nikoloska, Ronald M. Aarts
Abstract: We propose a categorical approach for unsupervised variational acoustic clustering of audio data in the time-frequency domain. The consideration of a categorical distribution enforces sharper clustering even when data points strongly overlap in time and frequency, which is the case for most datasets of urban acoustic scenes. To this end, we use a Gumbel-Softmax distribution as a soft approximation to the categorical distribution, allowing for training via backpropagation. In this settings, the softmax temperature serves as the main mechanism to tune clustering performance. The results show that the proposed model can obtain impressive clustering performance for all considered datasets, even when data points strongly overlap in time and frequency.

Title: Optimal Scalogram for Computational Complexity Reduction in Acoustic Recognition Using Deep Learning
Authors: Dang Thoai Phan, Tuan Anh Huynh, Van Tuan Pham, Cao Minh Tran, Van Thuan Mai, Ngoc Quy Tran
Abstract: The Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is an effective tool for feature extraction in acoustic recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly when applied to non-stationary audio. However, its high computational cost poses a significant challenge, often leading researchers to prefer alternative methods such as the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). To address this issue, this paper proposes a method to reduce the computational complexity of CWT by optimizing the length of the wavelet kernel and the hop size of the output scalogram. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining the robust performance of the trained model in acoustic recognition tasks.

Title: Channel Estimation for RIS-Assisted mmWave Systems via Diffusion Models
Authors: Yang Wang, Yin Xu, Cixiao Zhang, Zhiyong Chen, Mingzeng Dai, Haiming Wang, Bingchao Liu, Dazhi He, Meixia Tao
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been recognized as a promising technology for next-generation wireless communications. However, the performance of RIS-assisted systems critically depends on accurate channel state information (CSI). To address this challenge, this letter proposes a novel channel estimation method for RIS-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems based on diffusion models (DMs). Specifically, the forward diffusion process of the original signal is formulated to model the received signal as a noisy observation within the framework of DMs. Subsequently, the channel estimation task is formulated as the reverse diffusion process, and a sampling algorithm based on denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs) is developed to enable effective inference. Furthermore, a lightweight neural network, termed BRCNet, is introduced to replace the conventional U-Net, significantly reducing the number of parameters and computational complexity. Extensive experiments conducted under various scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing baselines.

Title: Improving Action Smoothness for a Cascaded Online Learning Flight Control System
Authors: Yifei Li, Erik-jan van Kampen
Abstract: This paper aims to improve the action smoothness of a cascaded online learning flight control system. Although the cascaded structure is widely used in flight control design, its stability can be compromised by oscillatory control actions, which poses challenges for practical engineering applications. To address this issue, we introduce an online temporal smoothness technique and a low-pass filter to reduce the amplitude and frequency of the control actions. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to analyze policy performance in the frequency domain. Simulation results demonstrate the improvements achieved by the two proposed techniques.

Title: Fast Equivariant Imaging: Acceleration for Unsupervised Learning via Augmented Lagrangian and Auxiliary PnP Denoisers
Authors: Guixian Xu, Jinglai Li, Junqi Tang
Abstract: In this work, we propose Fast Equivariant Imaging (FEI), a novel unsupervised learning framework to rapidly and efficiently train deep imaging networks without ground-truth data. From the perspective of reformulating the Equivariant Imaging based optimization problem via the method of Lagrange multipliers and utilizing plug-and-play denoisers, this novel unsupervised scheme shows superior efficiency and performance compared to the vanilla Equivariant Imaging paradigm. In particular, our FEI schemes achieve an order-of-magnitude (10x) acceleration over standard EI on training U-Net for X-ray CT reconstruction and image inpainting, with improved generalization performance.

Title: Privacy Disclosure of Similarity Rank in Speech and Language Processing
Authors: Tom Bäckström, Mohammad Hassan Vali, My Nguyen, Silas Rech
Abstract: Speaker, author, and other biometric identification applications often compare a sample's similarity to a database of templates to determine the identity. Given that data may be noisy and similarity measures can be inaccurate, such a comparison may not reliably identify the true identity as the most similar. Still, even the similarity rank based on an inaccurate similarity measure can disclose private information about the true identity. We propose a methodology for quantifying the privacy disclosure of such a similarity rank by estimating its probability distribution. It is based on determining the histogram of the similarity rank of the true speaker, or when data is scarce, modeling the histogram with the beta-binomial distribution. We express the disclosure in terms of entropy (bits), such that the disclosure from independent features are additive. Our experiments demonstrate that all tested speaker and author characterizations contain personally identifying information (PII) that can aid in identification, with embeddings from speaker recognition algorithms containing the most information, followed by phone embeddings, linguistic embeddings, and fundamental frequency. Our initial experiments show that the disclosure of PII increases with the length of test samples, but it is bounded by the length of database templates. The provided metric, similarity rank disclosure, provides a way to compare the disclosure of PII between biometric features and merge them to aid identification. It can thus aid in the holistic evaluation of threats to privacy in speech and other biometric technologies.

Title: Clustering of Acoustic Environments with Variational Autoencoders for Hearing Devices
Authors: Luan Vinícius Fiorio, Ivana Nikoloska, Wim van Houtum, Ronald M. Aarts
Abstract: Particularly in hearing devices, the environmental context is taken into account for audio processing, often through classification. Traditional acoustic environment classification relies on classical algorithms, which are unable to extract meaningful representations of high-dimensionality data, or on supervised learning, being limited by the availability of labels. Knowing that human-imposed labels do not always reflect the true structure of acoustic scenes, we explore the (unsupervised) clustering of acoustic environments using variational autoencoders (VAEs), presenting a structured latent space suitable for the task. We propose a VAE model for categorical latent clustering employing a Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization with a time-context windowing scheme, tailored for real-world hearing device scenarios. Additionally, general adaptations on VAE architectures for audio clustering are also proposed. The approaches are validated through the clustering of spoken digits, a simpler task where labels are meaningful, and urban soundscapes, which recordings present strong overlap in time and frequency. While all variational methods succeeded when clustering spoken digits, only the proposed model achieved effective clustering performance on urban acoustic scenes, given its categorical nature.

Title: MAKO: Meta-Adaptive Koopman Operators for Learning-based Model Predictive Control of Parametrically Uncertain Nonlinear Systems
Authors: Minghao Han, Kiwan Wong, Adrian Wing-Keung Law, Xunyuan Yin
Abstract: In this work, we propose a meta-learning-based Koopman modeling and predictive control approach for nonlinear systems with parametric uncertainties. An adaptive deep meta-learning-based modeling approach, called Meta Adaptive Koopman Operator (MAKO), is proposed. Without knowledge of the parametric uncertainty, the proposed MAKO approach can learn a meta-model from a multi-modal dataset and efficiently adapt to new systems with previously unseen parameter settings by using online data. Based on the learned meta Koopman model, a predictive control scheme is developed, and the stability of the closed-loop system is ensured even in the presence of previously unseen parameter settings. Through extensive simulations, our proposed approach demonstrates superior performance in both modeling accuracy and control efficacy as compared to competitive baselines.

Title: Training-Free Adaptive Quantization for Variable Rate Image Coding for Machines
Authors: Yui Tatsumi, Ziyue Zeng, Hiroshi Watanabe
Abstract: Image Coding for Machines (ICM) has become increasingly important with the rapid integration of computer vision technology into real-world applications. However, most neural network-based ICM frameworks operate at a fixed rate, thus requiring individual training for each target bitrate. This limitation may restrict their practical usage. Existing variable rate image compression approaches mitigate this issue but often rely on additional training, which increases computational costs and complicates deployment. Moreover, variable rate control has not been thoroughly explored for ICM. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free quantization strength control scheme that enables flexible bitrate adjustment. By exploiting the scale parameter predicted by the hyperprior network, the proposed method adaptively modulates quantization step sizes across both channel and spatial dimensions. This allows the model to preserve semantically important regions while coarsely quantizing less critical areas. Our architectural design further enables continuous bitrate control through a single parameter. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving up to 11.07% BD-rate savings over the non-adaptive variable rate baseline.

Title: Distributed Switching Model Predictive Control Meets Koopman Operator for Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance
Authors: Ali Azarbahram, Chrystian Pool Yuca Huanca, Gian Paolo Incremona, Patrizio Colaneri
Abstract: This paper introduces a Koopman-enhanced distributed switched model predictive control (SMPC) framework for safe and scalable navigation of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in dynamic environments with moving obstacles. The proposed method integrates switched motion modes and data-driven prediction to enable real-time, collision-free coordination. A localized Koopman operator approximates nonlinear obstacle dynamics as linear models based on online measurements, enabling accurate trajectory forecasting. These predictions are embedded into a distributed SMPC structure, where each UAV makes autonomous decisions using local and cluster-based information. This computationally efficient architecture is particularly promising for applications in surface transportation, including coordinated vehicle flows, shared infrastructure with pedestrians or cyclists, and urban UAV traffic. Simulation results demonstrate reliable formation control and real-time obstacle avoidance, highlighting the frameworks broad relevance for intelligent and cooperative mobility systems.

Title: WaveC2R: Wavelet-Driven Coarse-to-Refined Hierarchical Learning for Radar Retrieval
Authors: Chunlei Shi, Han Xu, Yinghao Li, Yi-Lin Wei, Yongchao Feng, Yecheng Zhang, Dan Niu
Abstract: Satellite-based radar retrieval methods are widely employed to fill coverage gaps in ground-based radar systems, especially in remote areas affected by terrain blockage and limited detection range. Existing methods predominantly rely on overly simplistic spatial-domain architectures constructed from a single data source, limiting their ability to accurately capture complex precipitation patterns and sharply defined meteorological boundaries. To address these limitations, we propose WaveC2R, a novel wavelet-driven coarse-to-refined framework for radar retrieval. WaveC2R integrates complementary multi-source data and leverages frequency-domain decomposition to separately model low-frequency components for capturing precipitation patterns and high-frequency components for delineating sharply defined meteorological boundaries. Specifically, WaveC2R consists of two stages (i)Intensity-Boundary Decoupled Learning, which leverages wavelet decomposition and frequency-specific loss functions to separately optimize low-frequency intensity and high-frequency boundaries; and (ii)Detail-Enhanced Diffusion Refinement, which employs frequency-aware conditional priors and multi-source data to progressively enhance fine-scale precipitation structures while preserving coarse-scale meteorological consistency. Experimental results on the publicly available SEVIR dataset demonstrate that WaveC2R achieves state-of-the-art performance in satellite-based radar retrieval, particularly excelling at preserving high-intensity precipitation features and sharply defined meteorological boundaries.

Title: Dissipativity and L2 Stability of Large-Scale Networks with Changing Interconnections
Authors: Ingyu Jang, Leila J. Bridgeman
Abstract: In this paper, the L2 stability of switched networks is studied based on the QSR-dissipativity of each agent. While the integration of dissipativity with switched systems has received considerable attention, most previous studies have focused on passivity, internal stability, or feedback networks involving only two agents. This work makes two contributions: first, the relationship between switched QSR-dissipativity and L2 stability is established based on the properties of dissipativity parameters of switched systems; and second, conditions for L2 stability of networks consisting of QSR-dissipative agents with switching interconnection topologies are derived. Crucially, this shows that a common storage function will exist across all modes, avoiding the need to find one, which becomes computationally taxing for large networks with many possible configurations. Numerical examples demonstrate how this can facilitate stability analysis for networked systems under arbitrary switching of swarm drones.

Title: A K-means Inspired Solution Framework for Large-Scale Multi-Traveling Salesman Problems
Authors: Xiubin Chen
Abstract: The Multi-Traveling Salesman Problem (MTSP) is a commonly used mathematical model for multi-agent task allocation. However, as the number of agents and task targets increases, existing optimization-based methods often incur prohibitive computational costs, posing significant challenges to large-scale coordination in unmanned systems. To address this issue, this paper proposes a K-means-inspired task allocation framework that reformulates the MTSP as a spatially constrained classification process. By leveraging spatial coherence, the proposed method enables fast estimation of path costs and efficient task grouping, thereby fundamentally reducing overall computational complexity. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the framework can maintain high solution quality even in extremely large-scale scenarios-for instance, in tasks involving 1000 agents and 5000 targets. The findings indicate that this "cluster-then-route" decomposition strategy offers an efficient and reliable solution for large-scale multi-agent task allocation.

Title: Design and Measurements of mmWave FMCW Radar Based Non-Contact Multi-Patient Heart Rate and Breath Rate Monitoring System
Authors: Jewel Benny, Pranjal Mahajan, Srayan Sankar Chatterjee, Mohd Wajid, Abhishek Srivastava
Abstract: Recent developments in mmWave radar technologies have enabled the truly non-contact heart-rate (HR) and breath-rate (BR) measurement approaches, which provides a great ease in patient monitoring. Additionally, these technologies also provide opportunities to simultaneously detect HR and BR of multiple patients, which has become increasingly important for efficient mass monitoring scenarios. In this work, a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) mmWave radar based truly non-contact multiple patient HR and BR monitoring system has been presented. Furthermore, a novel approach is also proposed, which combines multiple processing methods using a least squares solution to improve measurement accuracy, generalization, and handle measurement error. The proposed system has been developed using Texas Instruments' FMCW radar and experimental results with multiple subjects are also presented, which show >97% and >93% accuracy in the measured BR and HR values, respectively.

Title: Scalable Multisubject Vital Sign Monitoring With mmWave FMCW Radar and FPGA Prototyping
Authors: Jewel Benny, Narahari N. Moudhgalya, Mujeev Khan, Hemant Kumar Meena, Mohd Wajid, Abhishek Srivastava
Abstract: In this work, we introduce an innovative approach to estimate the vital signs of multiple human subjects simultaneously in a non-contact way using a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar-based system. Traditional vital sign monitoring methods often face significant limitations, including subject discomfort with wearable devices, challenges in calibration, and the risk of infection transmission through contact measurement devices. To address these issues, this research is motivated by the need for versatile, non-contact vital monitoring solutions applicable in various critical scenarios. This work also explores the challenges of extending this capability to an arbitrary number of subjects, including hardware and theoretical limitations. Supported by rigorous experimental results and discussions, the paper illustrates the system's potential to redefine vital sign monitoring. An FPGA-based implementation is also presented as proof of concept for a hardware-based and portable solution, improving upon previous works by offering 2.7x faster execution and 18.4% less Look-Up Table (LUT) utilization, as well as providing over 7400x acceleration compared to its software counterpart.

Title: Group-wise Semantic Splitting Multiple Access for Multi-User Semantic Communication
Authors: Jungyeon Koh, Hyeonho Noh, Hyun Jong Yang
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a group-wise semantic splitting multiple access framework for multi-user semantic communication in downlink scenarios. The framework begins by applying a balanced clustering mechanism that groups users based on the similarity of their semantic characteristics, enabling the extraction of group-level common features and user-specific private features. The base station then transmits the common features via multicast and the private features via unicast, effectively leveraging both shared and user-dependent semantic information. To further enhance semantic separability and reconstruction fidelity, we design a composite loss function that integrates a reconstruction loss with a repulsion loss, improving both the accuracy of semantic recovery and the distinctiveness of common embeddings in the latent space. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 3.26x performance improvement over conventional schemes across various channel conditions, validating its robustness and semantic efficiency for next-generation wireless networks.

Abstract: This paper addresses resilient collaborative localization in multi-agent systems exposed to spoofed radio frequency measurements. Each agent maintains multiple hypotheses of its own state and exchanges selected information with neighbors using covariance intersection. Geometric reductions based on distance tests and convex hull structure limit the number of hypotheses transmitted, controlling the spread of hypotheses through the network. The method enables agents to separate spoofed and truthful measurements and to recover consistent estimates once the correct hypothesis is identified. Numerical results demonstrate the ability of the approach to contain the effect of adversarial measurements, while also highlighting the impact of conservative fusion on detection speed. The framework provides a foundation for resilient multi-agent navigation and can be extended with coordinated hypothesis selection across the network.

Title: Entropy Coding for Non-Rectangular Transform Blocks using Partitioned DCT Dictionaries for AV1
Authors: Priyanka Das, Tim Classen, Mathias Wien
Abstract: Recent video codecs such as VVC and AV1 apply a Non-rectangular (NR) partitioning to combine prediction signals using a smooth blending around the boundary, followed by a rectangular transform on the whole block. The NR signal transformation is not yet supported. A transformation technique that applies the same partitioning to the 2D Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) bases and finds a sparse representation of the NR signal in such a dictionary showed promising gains in an experimental setup outside the reference software. This method uses the regular inverse transformation at the decoder to reconstruct a rectangular signal and discards the signal outside the region of interest. This design is appealing due to the minimal changes required at the decoder. However, current entropy coding schemes are not well-suited for optimally encoding these coefficients because they are primarily designed for DCT coefficients. This work introduces an entropy coding method that efficiently codes these transform coefficients by effectively modeling their properties. The design offers significant theoretical rate savings, estimated using conditional entropy, particularly for scenarios that are more dissimilar to DCT in an experimental setup.

Title: Total Least Square Optimal Analytic Signal by Structure Tensor for N-D images
Authors: Josef Bigun, Fernando Alonso-Fernandez
Abstract: We produce the analytic signal by using the Structure Tensor, which provides Total Least Squares optimal vectors for estimating orientation and scale locally. Together, these vectors represent N-D frequency components that determine adaptive, complex probing filters. The N-D analytic signal is obtained through scalar products of adaptive filters with image neighborhoods. It comprises orientation, scale, phase, and amplitude information of the neighborhood. The ST analytic signal $ f_A $ is continuous and isotropic, and its extension to N-D is straightforward. The phase gradient can be represented as a vector (instantaneous frequency) or as a tensor. Both are continuous and isotropic, while the tensor additionally preserves continuity of orientation and retains the same information as the vector representation. The tensor representation can also be used to detect singularities. Detection with known phase portraits has been demonstrated in 2-D with relevance to fringe pattern processing in wave physics, including optics and fingerprint measurements. To construct adaptive filters we have used Gabor filter family members as probing functions, but other function families can also be used to sample the spectrum, e.g., quadrature filters. A comparison to three baseline alternatives-in representation (Monogenic signal), enhancement (Monogenic signal combined with a spline-wavelet pyramid), and singularity detection (mindtct, a fingerprint minutia detector widely used in numerous studies)-is also reported using images with precisely known ground truths for location, orientation, singularity type (where applicable), and wave period.

Title: Linearly Constrained Diffusion Implicit Models
Authors: Vivek Jayaram, Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman, Steven M. Seitz, John Thickstun
Abstract: We introduce Linearly Constrained Diffusion Implicit Models (CDIM), a fast and accurate approach to solving noisy linear inverse problems using diffusion models. Traditional diffusion-based inverse methods rely on numerous projection steps to enforce measurement consistency in addition to unconditional denoising steps. CDIM achieves a 10-50x reduction in projection steps by dynamically adjusting the number and size of projection steps to align a residual measurement energy with its theoretical distribution under the forward diffusion process. This adaptive alignment preserves measurement consistency while substantially accelerating constrained inference. For noise-free linear inverse problems, CDIM exactly satisfies the measurement constraints with few projection steps, even when existing methods fail. We demonstrate CDIM's effectiveness across a range of applications, including super-resolution, denoising, inpainting, deblurring, and 3D point cloud reprojection. Code and an interactive demo can be found on our project website.

Title: Safe Multi-Robotic Arm Interaction via 3D Convex Shapes
Authors: Ali Umut Kaypak, Shiqing Wei, Prashanth Krishnamurthy, Farshad Khorrami
Abstract: Inter-robot collisions pose a significant safety risk when multiple robotic arms operate in close proximity. We present an online collision avoidance methodology leveraging High-Order Control Barrier Functions (HOCBFs) constructed for safe interactions among 3D convex shapes to address this issue. While prior works focused on using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for human-robotic arm and single-arm collision avoidance, we explore the problem of collision avoidance between multiple robotic arms operating in a shared space. In our methodology, we utilize the proposed HOCBFs as centralized and decentralized safety filters. These safety filters are compatible with many nominal controllers and ensure safety without significantly restricting the robots' workspace. A key challenge in implementing these filters is the computational overhead caused by the large number of safety constraints and the computation of a Hessian matrix per constraint. We address this challenge by employing numerical differentiation methods to approximate computationally intensive terms. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through extensive simulation studies and real-world experiments with Franka Research 3 robotic arms. The project video is available at this link.

Title: Axial-UNet: A Neural Weather Model for Precipitation Nowcasting
Authors: Sumit Mamtani, Maitreya Sonawane
Abstract: Accurately predicting short-term precipitation is critical for weather-sensitive applications such as disaster management, aviation, and urban planning. Traditional numerical weather prediction can be computationally intensive at high resolution and short lead times. In this work, we propose a lightweight UNet-based encoder-decoder augmented with axial-attention blocks that attend along image rows and columns to capture long-range spatial interactions, while temporal context is provided by conditioning on multiple past radar frames. Our hybrid architecture captures both local and long-range spatio-temporal dependencies from radar image sequences, enabling fixed lead-time precipitation nowcasting with modest compute. Experimental results on a preprocessed subset of the HKO-7 radar dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms ConvLSTM, pix2pix-style cGANs, and a plain UNet in pixel-fidelity metrics, reaching PSNR 47.67 and SSIM 0.9943. We report PSNR/SSIM here; extending evaluation to meteorology-oriented skill measures (e.g., CSI/FSS) is left to future work. The approach is simple, scalable, and effective for resource-constrained, real-time forecasting scenarios.

Title: Bridging Speech Emotion Recognition and Personality: Dataset and Temporal Interaction Condition Network
Authors: Yuan Gao, Hao Shi, Yahui Fu, Chenhui Chu, Tatsuya Kawahara
Abstract: This study investigates the interaction between personality traits and emotion expression, exploring how personality information can improve speech emotion recognition (SER). We collect the personality annotation for the IEMOCAP dataset, making it the first speech dataset that contains both emotion and personality annotations (PA-IEMOCAP), and enabling direct integration of personality traits into SER. Statistical analysis on this dataset identified significant correlations between personality traits and emotional expressions. To extract finegrained personality features, we propose a temporal interaction condition network (TICN), in which personality features are integrated with HuBERT-based acoustic features for SER. Experiments show that incorporating ground-truth personality traits significantly enhances valence recognition, improving the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) from 0.698 to 0.785 compared to the baseline without personality information. For practical applications in dialogue systems where personality information about the user is unavailable, we develop a front-end module of automatic personality recognition. Using these automatically predicted traits as inputs to our proposed TICN model, we achieve a CCC of 0.776 for valence recognition, representing an 11.17% relative improvement over the baseline. These findings confirm the effectiveness of personality-aware SER and provide a solid foundation for further exploration in personality-aware speech processing applications.

Title: Efficient Path Planning and Task Allocation Algorithm for Boolean Specifications
Authors: Ioana Hustiu, Roozbeh Abolpour, Marius Kloetzer, Cristian Mahulea
Abstract: This paper addresses path planning and task allocation in multi-robot systems subject to global Boolean specifications defined on the final state. The main contribution is the exploitation of the structural properties of a Petri net model: we prove that the associated constraint matrix is totally unimodular (TU). This property allows relaxing the original Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation to a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) in which all variables are continuous except for those that are corresponding to the atomic propositions in the Boolean specification. This yields a substantial reduction in complexity. In the special case where the specification is a conjunction of atomic propositions of cardinality equal to the team size, i.e., the standard Task-Assignment and Path Finding (TAPF) problem, the formulation reduces to a Linear Programming (LP). Collision-free paths are ensured by introducing intermediate synchronization points only when necessary, while robots move in parallel between them. These structural insights enable a computationally efficient and scalable solution, achieving tractability and safety for large-scale systems with up to 2500 robots.

Title: AgriPotential: A Novel Multi-Spectral and Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Dataset for Agricultural Potentials
Authors: Mohammad El Sakka, Caroline De Pourtales, Lotfi Chaari, Josiane Mothe
Abstract: Remote sensing has emerged as a critical tool for large-scale Earth monitoring and land management. In this paper, we introduce AgriPotential, a novel benchmark dataset composed of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery captured over multiple months. The dataset provides pixel-level annotations of agricultural potentials for three major crop types - viticulture, market gardening, and field crops - across five ordinal classes. AgriPotential supports a broad range of machine learning tasks, including ordinal regression, multi-label classification, and spatio-temporal modeling. The data cover diverse areas in Southern France, offering rich spectral information. AgriPotential is the first public dataset designed specifically for agricultural potential prediction, aiming to improve data-driven approaches to sustainable land use planning.

Title: DiffFuSR: Super-Resolution of all Sentinel-2 Multispectral Bands using Diffusion Models
Authors: Muhammad Sarmad, Arnt-Børre Salberg, Michael Kampffmeyer
Abstract: This paper presents DiffFuSR, a modular pipeline for super-resolving all 12 spectral bands of Sentinel-2 Level-2A imagery to a unified ground sampling distance (GSD) of 2.5 meters. The pipeline comprises two stages: (i) a diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) model trained on high-resolution RGB imagery from the NAIP and WorldStrat datasets, harmonized to simulate Sentinel-2 characteristics; and (ii) a learned fusion network that upscales the remaining multispectral bands using the super-resolved RGB image as a spatial prior. We introduce a robust degradation model and contrastive degradation encoder to support blind SR. Extensive evaluations of the proposed SR pipeline on the OpenSR benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms current SOTA baselines in terms of reflectance fidelity, spectral consistency, spatial alignment, and hallucination suppression. Furthermore, the fusion network significantly outperforms classical and learned pansharpening approaches, enabling accurate enhancement of Sentinel-2's 20 m and 60 m bands. This work proposes a novel modular framework Sentinel-2 SR that utilizes harmonized learning with diffusion models and fusion strategies. Our code and models can be found at this https URL.

Title: LAPS-Diff: A Diffusion-Based Framework for Singing Voice Synthesis With Language Aware Prosody-Style Guided Learning
Authors: Sandipan Dhar, Mayank Gupta, Preeti Rao
Abstract: The field of Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) has seen significant advancements in recent years due to the rapid progress of diffusion-based approaches. However, capturing vocal style, genre-specific pitch inflections, and language-dependent characteristics remains challenging, particularly in low-resource scenarios. To address this, we propose LAPS-Diff, a diffusion model integrated with language-aware embeddings and a vocal-style guided learning mechanism, specifically designed for Bollywood Hindi singing style. We curate a Hindi SVS dataset and leverage pre-trained language models to extract word and phone-level embeddings for an enriched lyrics representation. Additionally, we incorporated a style encoder and a pitch extraction model to compute style and pitch losses, capturing features essential to the naturalness and expressiveness of the synthesized singing, particularly in terms of vocal style and pitch variations. Furthermore, we utilize MERT and IndicWav2Vec models to extract musical and contextual embeddings, serving as conditional priors to refine the acoustic feature generation process further. Based on objective and subjective evaluations, we demonstrate that LAPS-Diff significantly improves the quality of the generated samples compared to the considered state-of-the-art (SOTA) model for our constrained dataset that is typical of the low resource scenario.

Title: MuFlex: A Scalable, Physics-based Platform for Multi-Building Flexibility Analysis and Coordination
Authors: Ziyan Wu, Ivan Korolija, Rui Tang
Abstract: With the increasing penetration of renewable generation on the power grid, maintaining system balance requires coordinated demand flexibility from aggregations of buildings. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely explored for building controls because of its model-free nature. Open-source simulation testbeds are essential not only for training RL agents but also for fairly benchmarking control strategies. However, most building-sector testbeds target single buildings; multi-building platforms are relatively limited and typically rely on simplified models (e.g., Resistanc-Capacitance) or data-driven approaches, which lack the ability to fully capture the physical intricacies and intermediate variables necessary for interpreting control performance. Moreover, these platforms often impose fixed inputs, outputs, and model formats, restricting their applicability as benchmarking tools across diverse control scenarios. To address these gaps, MuFlex, a scalable, open-source platform for multi-building flexibility coordination, was developed. MuFlex enables synchronous information exchange across EnergyPlus building models and adheres to the latest OpenAI Gym interface, providing a modular, standardized RL implementation. The platform's capabilities were demonstrated in a case study coordinating demand flexibility across four office buildings using the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. The results show that under four buildings' coordination, SAC effectively reduced the aggregated peak demand by nearly 12% with maintained indoor comfort to ensure the power demand below the threshold. The platform is released open-source on GitHub: this https URL.

Title: Composition and Alignment of Diffusion Models using Constrained Learning
Authors: Shervin Khalafi, Ignacio Hounie, Dongsheng Ding, Alejandro Ribeiro
Abstract: Diffusion models have become prevalent in generative modeling due to their ability to sample from complex distributions. To improve the quality of generated samples and their compliance with user requirements, two commonly used methods are: (i) Alignment, which involves finetuning a diffusion model to align it with a reward; and (ii) Composition, which combines several pretrained diffusion models together, each emphasizing a desirable attribute in the generated outputs. However, trade-offs often arise when optimizing for multiple rewards or combining multiple models, as they can often represent competing properties. Existing methods cannot guarantee that the resulting model faithfully generates samples with all the desired properties. To address this gap, we propose a constrained optimization framework that unifies alignment and composition of diffusion models by enforcing that the aligned model satisfies reward constraints and/or remains close to each pretrained model. We provide a theoretical characterization of the solutions to the constrained alignment and composition problems and develop a Lagrangian-based primal-dual training algorithm to approximate these solutions. Empirically, we demonstrate our proposed approach in image generation, applying it to alignment and composition, and show that our aligned or composed model satisfies constraints effectively.

Title: Learning and composing of classical music using restricted Boltzmann machines
Authors: Mutsumi Kobayashi, Hiroshi Watanabe
Abstract: We investigate how machine learning models acquire the ability to compose music and how musical information is internally represented within such models. We develop a composition algorithm based on a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), a simple generative model capable of producing musical pieces of arbitrary length. We convert musical scores into piano-roll image representations and train the RBM in an unsupervised manner. We confirm that the trained RBM can generate new musical pieces; however, by analyzing the model's responses and internal structure, we find that the learned information is not stored in a form directly interpretable by humans. This study contributes to a better understanding of how machine learning models capable of music composition may internally represent musical structure and highlights issues related to the interpretability of generative models in creative tasks.

Title: Manifold-Aware Diffusion-Augmented Contrastive Learning for Noise-Robust Biosignal Representation
Authors: Rami Zewail
Abstract: Learning robust representations for physiological time-series signals continues to pose a substantial challenge in developing efficient few-shot learning applications. This difficulty is largely due to the complex pathological variations in biosignals. In this context, this paper introduces a manifold-aware Diffusion-Augmented Contrastive Learning (DACL) framework, which efficiently leverages the generative structure of latent diffusion models with the discriminative power of supervised contrastive learning. The proposed framework operates within a contextualized scattering latent space derived from Scattering Transformer (ST) features. Within a contrastive learning framework, we employ a forward diffusion process in the scattering latent space as a structured manifold-aware feature augmentation technique. We assessed the proposed framework using the PhysioNet 2017 ECG benchmark dataset. The proposed method achieved a competitive AUROC of 0.9741 in the task of detecting atrial fibrillation from a single-lead ECG signal. The proposed framework achieved performance on par with relevant state-of-the-art related works. In-depth evaluation findings suggest that early-stage diffusion serves as an ideal "local manifold explorer," producing embeddings with greater precision than typical augmentation methods while preserving inference efficiency.

Title: Gelina: Unified Speech and Gesture Synthesis via Interleaved Token Prediction
Authors: Téo Guichoux, Théodor Lemerle, Shivam Mehta, Jonas Beskow, Gustav Eje Henter, Laure Soulier, Catherine Pelachaud, Nicolas Obin
Abstract: Human communication is multimodal, with speech and gestures tightly coupled, yet most computational methods for generating speech and gestures synthesize them sequentially, weakening synchrony and prosody alignment. We introduce Gelina, a unified framework that jointly synthesizes speech and co-speech gestures from text using interleaved token sequences in a discrete autoregressive backbone, with modality-specific decoders. Gelina supports multi-speaker and multi-style cloning and enables gesture-only synthesis from speech inputs. Subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate competitive speech quality and improved gesture generation over unimodal baselines.

Title: STAR-Bench: Probing Deep Spatio-Temporal Reasoning as Audio 4D Intelligence
Authors: Zihan Liu, Zhikang Niu, Qiuyang Xiao, Zhisheng Zheng, Ruoqi Yuan, Yuhang Zang, Yuhang Cao, Xiaoyi Dong, Jianze Liang, Xie Chen, Leilei Sun, Dahua Lin, Jiaqi Wang
Abstract: Despite rapid progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models and Large Audio-Language Models, existing audio benchmarks largely test semantics that can be recovered from text captions, masking deficits in fine-grained perceptual reasoning. We formalize audio 4D intelligence that is defined as reasoning over sound dynamics in time and 3D space, and introduce STAR-Bench to measure it. STAR-Bench combines a Foundational Acoustic Perception setting (six attributes under absolute and relative regimes) with a Holistic Spatio-Temporal Reasoning setting that includes segment reordering for continuous and discrete processes and spatial tasks spanning static localization, multi-source relations, and dynamic trajectories. Our data curation pipeline uses two methods to ensure high-quality samples. For foundational tasks, we use procedurally synthesized and physics-simulated audio. For holistic data, we follow a four-stage process that includes human annotation and final selection based on human performance. Unlike prior benchmarks where caption-only answering reduces accuracy slightly, STAR-Bench induces far larger drops (-31.5\% temporal, -35.2\% spatial), evidencing its focus on linguistically hard-to-describe cues. Evaluating 19 models reveals substantial gaps compared with humans and a capability hierarchy: closed-source models are bottlenecked by fine-grained perception, while open-source models lag across perception, knowledge, and reasoning. Our STAR-Bench provides critical insights and a clear path forward for developing future models with a more robust understanding of the physical world.

Title: Collaborative Large Language Model Inference via Resource-Aware Parallel Speculative Decoding
Authors: Jungyeon Koh, Hyun Jong Yang
Abstract: The growing demand for on-device large language model (LLM) inference highlights the need for efficient mobile edge computing (MEC) solutions, especially in resource-constrained settings. Speculative decoding offers a promising solution by partitioning token generation between a lightweight draft model on mobile devices and a powerful target model on edge servers, but suffers from communication overhead and asynchronous delays. This paper is the first to propose a unified framework that jointly optimizes user association and resource allocation (UARA) to support efficient parallel speculative decoding. We solve the UARA problem using a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm. To evaluate our approach under realistic conditions, we conduct experiments using the Sionna simulator. Results show that our method achieves up to 28.0% and an average of 23.7% reduction in end-to-end latency without compromising inference accuracy, enabling scalable and low-latency LLM services in MEC systems.

Title: Nash-equilibrium Seeking Algorithm for Power-Allocation Games on Networks of International Relations
Authors: Chuanzhe Zhang, Yuke Li, Wenjun Mei
Abstract: In the field of international security, understanding the strategic interactions between countries within a networked context is crucial. Our previous research has introduced a ``games-on-signed graphs'' framework~\cite{LiMorse2022} to analyze these interactions. While the framework is intended to be basic and general, there is much left to be explored, particularly in capturing the complexity of strategic scenarios in international relations. Our paper aims to fill this gap in two key ways. First, we modify the existing preference axioms to allow for a more nuanced understanding of how countries pursue self-survival, defense of allies, and offense toward adversaries. Second, we introduce a novel algorithm that proves the existence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium for these revised games. To validate our model, we employ historical data from the year 1940 as the game input and predict countries' survivability. Our contributions thus extend the real-world applicability of the original framework, offering a more comprehensive view of strategic interactions in a networked security environment.

Title: PrismAudio: Decomposed Chain-of-Thoughts and Multi-dimensional Rewards for Video-to-Audio Generation
Authors: Huadai Liu, Kaicheng Luo, Wen Wang, Qian Chen, Peiwen Sun, Rongjie Huang, Xiangang Li, Jieping Ye, Wei Xue
Abstract: Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation requires balancing four critical perceptual dimensions: semantic consistency, audio-visual temporal synchrony, aesthetic quality, and spatial accuracy; yet existing methods suffer from objective entanglement that conflates competing goals in single loss functions and lack human preference alignment. We introduce PrismAudio, the first framework to integrate Reinforcement Learning into V2A generation with specialized Chain-of-Thought (CoT) planning. Our approach decomposes monolithic reasoning into four specialized CoT modules (Semantic, Temporal, Aesthetic, and Spatial CoT), each paired with targeted reward functions. This CoT-reward correspondence enables multidimensional RL optimization that guides the model to jointly generate better reasoning across all perspectives, solving the objective entanglement problem while preserving interpretability. To make this optimization computationally practical, we propose Fast-GRPO, which employs hybrid ODE-SDE sampling that dramatically reduces the training overhead compared to existing GRPO implementations. We also introduce AudioCanvas, a rigorous benchmark that is more distributionally balanced and covers more realistically diverse and challenging scenarios than existing datasets, with 300 single-event classes and 501 multi-event samples. Experimental results demonstrate that PrismAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance across all four perceptual dimensions on both the in-domain VGGSound test set and out-of-domain AudioCanvas benchmark.

Title: MTTR-A: Measuring Cognitive Recovery Latency in Multi-Agent Systems
Authors: Barak Or
Abstract: Ensuring cognitive stability in autonomous multi-agent systems (MAS) is a central challenge for large-scale, distributed AI. While existing observability tools monitor system outputs, they cannot quantify how rapidly agentic workflows recover once reasoning coherence has been lost. We adapt classical reliability metrics-Mean Time-to-Recovery (MTTR), Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), and related ratios-into the cognitive domain, defining MTTR-A (Mean Time-to-Recovery for Agentic Systems) as a runtime measure of cognitive recovery latency. MTTR-A quantifies the time required for a MAS to detect reasoning drift and restore consistent operation, capturing the recovery of reasoning coherence rather than infrastructural repair. A benchmark simulation using the AG~News corpus and the LangGraph orchestration framework was conducted, modeling recovery latencies across multiple reflex modes. Automated reflexes restored stability within approximately 6s on average, while human-approval interventions required about 12s. Across 200 runs, the median simulated MTTR-A was 6.21+-2.14s, MTBF=6.7+-2.14s, and NRR=0.08, demonstrating measurable runtime resilience across reflex strategies. By formalizing recovery latency as a quantifiable property of distributed reasoning-and deriving reliability bounds linking recovery time and cognitive uptime-this work establishes a foundation for runtime dependability in agentic cognition, transforming cognitive recovery from an ad-hoc process into a standardized, interpretable performance
