Title: Nonlinear Stacked Intelligent Surfaces for Wireless Systems
Authors: Omran Abbas, Abdullah Zayat, Loıc Markley, Anas Chaaban
Abstract: Stacked intelligent surfaces (SIS) are a promising technology for next-generation wireless systems, offering an opportunity to enhance communication performance with low power consumption. Typically, an SIS is modelled as a surface that imparts phase shifts on impinging electromagnetic signals to achieve desired communication objectives. However, this mode of operation results in a linear SIS, which limits its applicability to linear operations. To unlock further SIS potential, we propose a nonlinear SIS that can mimic the behaviour of nonlinear neural networks. We discuss the feasibility and potential of this idea and propose a nonlinear SIS unit cell with a step-like response. To evaluate the system-level performance of nonlinear SIS, we present a case study where SIS structures are optimized to minimize the symbol error rate (SER) in an MIMO system with SIS deployed at both the transmitter and receiver sides using only statistical channel information. We demonstrate that a nonlinear SIS can improve communication reliability compared to a linear SIS by forming complex signal patterns across the SIS surface, which provide higher diversity against noise disturbances, while still allowing the receiver to discern these patterns. Finally, we outline several potential applications of nonlinear SIS in wireless communication scenarios.

Title: Maximal Load Shedding Verification for Neural Network Models of AC Line Switching
Authors: Samuel Chevalier, Duncan Starkenburg, Robert Parker, Noah Rhodes
Abstract: Solving for globally optimal line switching decisions in AC transmission grids can be intractability slow. Machine learning (ML) models, meanwhile, can be trained to predict near-optimal decisions at a fraction of the speed. Verifying the performance and impact of these ML models on network operation, however, is a critically important step prior to their actual deployment. In this paper, we train a Neural Network (NN) to solve the optimal power shutoff line switching problem. To assess the worst-case load shedding induced by this model, we propose a bilevel attacker-defender verification approach that finds the NN line switching decisions that cause the highest quantity of network load shedding. Solving this problem to global optimality is challenging (due to AC power flow and NN nonconvexities), so our approach exploits a convex relaxation of the AC physics, combined with a local NN search, to find a guaranteed lower bound on worst--case load shedding. These under-approximation bounds are solved via this http URL. We benchmark against a random sampling approach, and we find that our optimization-based approach always finds larger load shedding. Test results are collected on multiple PGLib test cases and on trained NN models which contain more than 10 million model parameters.

Title: A Simultaneous ECG-PCG Acquisition System with Real-Time Burst-Adaptive Noise Cancellation
Authors: Avishka Herath, Malith Jayalath, Kumudu Kaushalya, Sanjana Kapukotuwa, Chathuni Wijegunawardena, Pahan Mendis, Kithmin Wickremasinghe, Duminda Samarasinghe, Wageesha N. Manamperi, Chamira U. S. Edussooriya
Abstract: Cardiac auscultation is an essential clinical skill, requiring excellent hearing to distinguish subtle differences in timing and pitch of heart sounds. However, diagnosing solely from these sounds is often challenging due to interference from surrounding noise, and the information may be limited. Existing solutions that adaptively cancel external noise are either not real-time or are computationally intensive, making them unsuitable for implementation in a portable system. This work proposes an end-to-end system with a real-time adaptive noise cancellation pipeline integrated into a device that simultaneously acquires electrocardiogram (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) signals. The performance of the system is validated using real-world hospital noise datasets and recordings captured with the dual-modality device. For PCG and ECG signals recorded from the device in noisy hospital settings, the proposed algorithms achieved signal-to-noise ratio improvements of 37.01 dB and 30.32 dB, respectively. These results demonstrate the systems effectiveness in enabling reliable and accessible cardiac screening, including noisy hospital environments typical of resource-constrained settings.

Title: MDP-based Energy-aware Task Scheduling for Battery-less IoT
Authors: Shahab Jahanbazi, Mateen Ashraf, Onel L. A. López
Abstract: Realizing high long-term task completion rates represents a fundamental challenge in battery-less Internet of Things (IoT) devices powered by ambient energy harvesting. This difficulty is primarily due to the stochastic and time-varying characteristics of the available energy, which significantly complicate the design of optimal task scheduling policies. In this paper, we consider a battery-less IoT device that must periodically report sensing measurements to a monitoring center. We adopt the Markov decision process (MDP) framework to handle energy variability while aiming to maximize the long-term task completion rate. For this, we first identify its components and then define two appropriate reward functions. We demonstrate the inherent properties associated with the MDP formulation and the related optimal policy. Subsequently, we solve the resulting optimization problem, leading to the optimal stationary threshold-based (OSTB) scheduling. Simulation results demonstrate that OSTB outperforms the well-known ``as late as possible'' (ALAP) scheduling strategy. For instance, an $8.6\%$ increase in the task completion rate, along with a $65\%$ reduction in power failures and a $86.29\%$ decrease in execution delays during task execution are registered assuming a $4.7$ mF capacitor.

Title: Communication in a Fractional World: MIMO MC-OTFS Precoder Prediction
Authors: Evan Allen, Karim Said, Robert Calderbank, Lingjia Liu
Abstract: As 6G technologies advance, international bodies and regulatory agencies are intensifying efforts to extend seamless connectivity especially for high-mobility scenarios such as Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (\textit{MANETs}) types such as Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (\textit{VANETs}) and Flying Ad-Hoc Networks (\textit{FANETs}). For these environments to be considered for long term adoption and use they must support Multiple-Input-Multiple- (MIMO) technology, rapidly fluctuating channel conditions in these environments place a heavy burden on traditional time-frequency CSI feedback schemes required for MIMO precoding. This motivates a shift toward delay-Doppler representations like those employed by Orthogonal Time-Frequency Space(OTFS) modulation, which offers greater stability under mobility. We derive an expression for the variation over time in the OTFS I/O relationship. We then use this to create a physics informed complex exponential basis expansion model prediction framework that maximizes the usefulness of outdated Channel State Information (CSI) in the presence of integer and fractional delay-Doppler channels and facilitates high mobility MIMO communication.

Title: Coordinated Multipoint Transmission in Pinching Antenna Systems
Authors: Ali Amhaz, Shreya Khisa, Mohamed Elhattab, Chadi Assi, Sanaa Sharafeddine
Abstract: We study a coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission where two base stations (BSs), each supported by a pinching antenna system (PASS), are deployed to jointly serve communication users under spatial division multiple access (SDMA) technology. Pinching Antenna technology was introduced as a promising solution to overcome the large-scale fading that has been shown to be an impediment in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. To realize the advantages of this technology in CoMP systems, which suffer from an upperbound rate limitation when traditional uniform linear arrays (ULAs) are adopted, we formulate an optimization problem with the aim of maximizing the achievable sum rate by jointly determining the transmit beamforming vectors and pinching locations on the waveguides while respecting the quality of service (QoS) requirements of users. This problem is inherently non-convex due to the strong coupling among its decision parameters, making it challenging to solve using traditional optimization methods. Thus, we utilize a gradient-based meta-learning (GML) strategy specifically designed for large-scale optimization tasks. Finally, numerical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed GML approach, achieving 92 percent of the optimal solution, and the superiority of the solution presented compared to other benchmarks. In addition, it achieves a higher upper bound on the achievable rate compared to conventional CoMP systems.

Title: Accurate Prediction of Nonlinear Distortion of Multi-Carrier Signals
Authors: Cameron M. Pike, Brad Oney, Gabriel Hepner, Animesh Yadav
Abstract: Nonlinearities in power amplifiers adversely affect multi-carrier modulation techniques. Accurate prediction of nonlinear distortion is essential for making design trade-offs between output power and network throughput. We use the series form of the characteristic function (ch.f.) method to predict distortion spectra for sparse multi-carrier transmissions. This method results in efficient calculations of individual signal and distortion components. The method is validated both theoretically and practically. Theoretical validation is performed by modeling the signal as a bandpass Gaussian process that is hard limited, and it is shown that the series ch.f. method produces results that are identical with the classical Price's theorem. Practical validation is shown by considering an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal with a fragmented spectrum which is then applied to an amplifier driven into compression for which application of Price's theorem is difficult, and the predicted output spectrum corroborates laboratory measurements. Part of the computational efficiency is realized in that the nonlinearity can be expressed as the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of samples of its forward scattering parameter (i.e., S21) or transconductance function (including AM-PM effects), and distortion contributions of the signal can be expressed as numerical autoconvolutions of the clean spectrum. Signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) can be easily computed and parameterized across variables of interest, such as overdrive level.

Title: A Neural Model for Contextual Biasing Score Learning and Filtering
Authors: Wanting Huang, Weiran Wang
Abstract: Contextual biasing improves automatic speech recognition (ASR) by integrating external knowledge, such as user-specific phrases or entities, during decoding. In this work, we use an attention-based biasing decoder to produce scores for candidate phrases based on acoustic information extracted by an ASR encoder, which can be used to filter out unlikely phrases and to calculate bonus for shallow-fusion biasing. We introduce a per-token discriminative objective that encourages higher scores for ground-truth phrases while suppressing distractors. Experiments on the Librispeech biasing benchmark show that our method effectively filters out majority of the candidate phrases, and significantly improves recognition accuracy under different biasing conditions when the scores are used in shallow fusion biasing. Our approach is modular and can be used with any ASR system, and the filtering mechanism can potentially boost performance of other biasing methods.

Title: Neural Two-Stage Stochastic Volt-VAR Optimization for Three-Phase Unbalanced Distribution Systems with Network Reconfiguration
Authors: Zhentong Shao, Jingtao Qin, Nanpeng Yu
Abstract: The increasing integration of intermittent distributed energy resources (DERs) has introduced significant variability in distribution networks, posing challenges to voltage regulation and reactive power management. This paper presents a novel neural two-stage stochastic Volt-VAR optimization (2S-VVO) method for three-phase unbalanced distribution systems considering network reconfiguration under uncertainty. To address the computational intractability associated with solving large-scale scenario-based 2S-VVO problems, a learning-based acceleration strategy is introduced, wherein the second-stage recourse model is approximated by a neural network. This neural approximation is embedded into the optimization model as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), enabling effective enforcement of operational constraints related to the first-stage decisions. Numerical simulations on a 123-bus unbalanced distribution system demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves over 50 times speedup compared to conventional solvers and decomposition methods, while maintaining a typical optimality gap below 0.30%. These results underscore the method's efficacy and scalability in addressing large-scale stochastic VVO problems under practical operating conditions.

Title: A Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning Approach to Real-Time Economic Dispatch with Multi-Transmission-Node DER Aggregation
Authors: Zhentong Shao, Jingtao Qin, Xianbang Chen, Nanpeng Yu
Abstract: The integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into wholesale electricity markets, as mandated by FERC Order 2222, imposes new challenges on system operations. To remain consistent with existing market structures, regional transmission organizations (RTOs) have advanced the aggregation of transmission-node-level DERs (T-DERs), where a nodal virtual power plant (VPP) represents the mapping of all distribution-level DERs to their respective transmission nodes. This paper develops a real-time economic dispatch (RTED) framework that enables multi-transmission-node DER aggregation while addressing computational efficiency. To this end, we introduce a spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) for adaptive prediction of distribution factors (DFs), thereby capturing the dynamic influence of individual T-DERs across the transmission system. Furthermore, an iterative constraint identification strategy is incorporated to alleviate transmission security constraints without compromising system reliability. Together, these innovations accelerate the market clearing process and support the effective participation of T-DER aggregators under current market paradigms. The proposed approach is validated on large-scale test systems, including modified 118-, 2383-, and 3012-bus networks under a rolling RTED setting with real demand data. Numerical results demonstrate significant improvements in reducing operational costs and maintaining transmission network feasibility, underscoring the scalability and practicality of the proposed framework.

Title: Carbon-Aware Optimal Power Flow with Data-Driven Carbon Emission Tracing
Authors: Zhentong Shao, Nanpeng Yu
Abstract: Quantifying locational carbon emissions in power grids is crucial for implementing effective carbon reduction strategies for customers relying on electricity. This paper presents a carbon-aware optimal power flow (OPF) framework that incorporates data-driven carbon tracing, enabling rapid estimation of nodal carbon emissions from electric loads. By developing generator-to-load carbon emission distribution factors through data-driven technique, the analytical formulas for both average and marginal carbon emissions can be derived and integrated seamlessly into DC OPF models as linear constraints. The proposed carbon-aware OPF model enables market operators to optimize energy dispatch while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Simulations on IEEE test systems confirm the accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed approach, highlighting its applicability for real-time carbon-aware system operations.

Title: Learning-based Spectral Regression for Cocoa Bean Physicochemical Property Prediction
Authors: Kebin Contreras, Emmanuel Martinez, Brayan Monroy, Sebastian Ardila, Cristian Ramirez, Mariana Caicedo, Hans Garcia, Tatiana Gelvez-Barrera, Juan Poveda-Jaramillo, Henry Arguello, Jorge Bacca
Abstract: Cocoa bean quality assessment is essential for ensuring compliance with commercial standards, protecting consumer health, and increasing the market value of the cocoa product. The quality assessment estimates key physicochemical properties, such as fermentation level, moisture content, polyphenol concentration, and cadmium content, among others. This assessment has traditionally relied on the accurate estimation of these properties via visual or sensory evaluation, jointly with laboratory-based physicochemical analyses, which are often time-consuming, destructive, and difficult to scale. This creates the need for rapid, reliable, and noninvasive alternatives. Spectroscopy, particularly in the visible and near-infrared ranges, offers a non-invasive alternative by capturing the molecular signatures associated with these properties. Therefore, this work introduces a scalable methodology for evaluating the quality of cocoa beans by predicting key physicochemical properties from the spectral signatures of cocoa beans. This approach utilizes a conveyor belt system integrated with a VIS-NIR spectrometer, coupled with learning-based regression models. Furthermore, a dataset is built using cocoa bean batches from Santander, Colombia. Ground-truth reference values were obtained through standardized laboratory analyses and following commercial cocoa quality regulations. To further evaluate the proposed methodology's generalization, performance is tested on samples collected from other Colombian regions and from Cusco, Peru. Experimental results show that the proposed models achieved R2 scores exceeding 0.98 across all physicochemical properties, and reached 0.96 accuracy on geographically independent samples. This non-destructive approach represents a suitable and scalable alternative to conventional laboratory methods for quality assessment across the cocoa production chain.

Title: Modeling and Scheduling of Fusion Patterns in Autonomous Driving Systems (Extended Version)
Authors: Hoora Sobhani, Hyoseung Kim
Abstract: In Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS), Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) are widely used to model complex data dependencies and inter-task communication. However, existing DAG scheduling approaches oversimplify data fusion tasks by assuming fixed triggering mechanisms, failing to capture the diverse fusion patterns found in real-world ADS software stacks. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for analyzing various fusion patterns and their performance implications in ADS. Our framework models three distinct fusion task types: timer-triggered, wait-for-all, and immediate fusion, which comprehensively represent real-world fusion behaviors. Our Integer Linear Programming (ILP)-based approach enables an optimization of multiple real-time performance metrics, including reaction time, time disparity, age of information, and response time, while generating deterministic offline schedules directly applicable to real platforms. Evaluation using real-world ADS case studies, Raspberry Pi implementation, and randomly generated DAGs demonstrates that our framework handles diverse fusion patterns beyond the scope of existing work, and achieves substantial performance improvements in comparable scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents a new derivation of LEO-to-ground receiver channel model to address a clear gap in the prior art: the lack of an appropriate geometry aware characterization of non LOS (NLOS) link model represented by the power spectral density (PSD). Specifically, the main contribution is a coherent derivation of the PSD from 1st principles that is able to reproduce results in prior art and explain the causal relationship of main PSD features to the propagation geometry parameters.

Title: Inferring Group Intent as a Cooperative Game. An NLP-based Framework for Trajectory Analysis using Graph Transformer Neural Network
Authors: Yiming Zhang, Vikram Krishnamurthy, Shashwat Jain
Abstract: This paper studies group target trajectory intent as the outcome of a cooperative game where the complex-spatio trajectories are modeled using an NLP-based generative model. In our framework, the group intent is specified by the characteristic function of a cooperative game, and allocations for players in the cooperative game are specified by either the core, the Shapley value, or the nucleolus. The resulting allocations induce probability distributions that govern the coordinated spatio-temporal trajectories of the targets that reflect the group's underlying intent. We address two key questions: (1) How can the intent of a group trajectory be optimally formalized as the characteristic function of a cooperative game? (2) How can such intent be inferred from noisy observations of the targets? To answer the first question, we introduce a Fisher-information-based characteristic function of the cooperative game, which yields probability distributions that generate coordinated spatio-temporal patterns. As a generative model for these patterns, we develop an NLP-based generative model built on formal grammar, enabling the creation of realistic multi-target trajectory data. To answer the second question, we train a Graph Transformer Neural Network (GTNN) to infer group trajectory intent-expressed as the characteristic function of the cooperative game-from observational data with high accuracy. The self-attention function of the GTNN depends on the track estimates. Thus, the formulation and algorithms provide a multi-layer approach that spans target tracking (Bayesian signal processing) and the GTNN (for group intent inference).

Title: Machine Learning-Driven User Localization in RIS-Assisted Wireless Systems
Authors: M. T. Hassan, D. Zelenchuk, M. A. B. Abbasi
Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) targets ultra reliable, low latency (URLLC) gigabit connectivity in mmWave bands, where directional channels require precise beam alignment. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) reshape wave propagation and extend coverage, but they enlarge the beam search space at the base station, making exhaustive sweeps inefficient due to control overhead and latency. We propose an ML based user localization framework for RIS assisted communication at 27 GHz. A 20x20 RIS reflects signals from a core network connected base station and sweeps beams across the 0-90 degree elevation plane, divided into four angular sectors. We build a dataset by recording received signal power (Pr in dBm) across user locations and train multiple regressors, including decision tree (DT), support vector regressor (SVR), k nearest neighbor (KNN), XGBoost, gradient boosting, and random forest. In operation, an unknown user in the same plane measures four received power values (one per sector) and reports them to the pretrained RIS controller, which predicts the user's angular position in real time. Evaluation using mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R squared (R2) shows high accuracy. The DT model achieves an MAE of 4.8 degrees with R2 = 0.96, while other models reach 70 to 86 percent. Predicted radiation patterns, including main lobe alignment between 52 and 55 degrees, closely track ground truth. The framework reduces beam probing, enables faster alignment, and lowers latency for RIS assisted 6G networks.

Title: Dynamical Modeling of Temperature and Smoke Evolution in a Thermal-Runaway Event of a Large-Format Lithium-ion Battery in a Mine Tunnel
Authors: Khadija Omar Said, Yukta Pareek, Satadru Dey, Ashish Ranjan Kumar
Abstract: Large-format lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) provide effective energy storage solutions for high-power equipment used in underground mining operations. They have high Columbic efficiency and minimal heat and emission footprints. However, improper use of LIBs, accidents, or other factors may increase the probability of thermal runaway (TR), a rapid combustion reaction that discharges toxic and flammable substances. Several such incidents have been documented in mines. Since repeatable TR experiments to uncover the transient-state propagation of TR are expensive and hazardous, high-fidelity models are usually developed to mimic the impact of these events. They are resource-intensive and are impractical to develop for many scenarios that could be observed in a mine. Therefore, dynamic models within a reduced-order framework were constructed to represent the transient-state combustion event. Reduced order models (ROMs) reasonably replicate trends in temperature and smoke, showing strong alignment with the ground-truth dataset.

Title: Secure Control of Connected and Autonomous Electrified Vehicles Under Adversarial Cyber-Attacks
Authors: Shashank Dhananjay Vyas, Satadru Dey
Abstract: Connected and Autonomous Electrified Vehicles (CAEV) is the solution to the future smart mobility having benefits of efficient traffic flow and cleaner environmental impact. Although CAEV has advantages they are still susceptible to adversarial cyber attacks due to their autonomous electric operation and the involved connectivity. To alleviate this issue, we propose a secure control architecture of CAEV. Particularly, we design an additional control input using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to be applied to the vehicle powertrain along with the input commanded by the battery. We present simulation case studies to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach in keeping the CAEV platoon operating safely without collisions by curbing the effect of adversarial attacks.

Title: Localized Acoustic-Event Measurement Probe: Connector Confirmation Utilizing Acoustic Signatures
Authors: Brian Skoglind, Travis Roberts, Sourabh Karmakar, Cameron Turner, Laine Mears
Abstract: Modern consumer products are full of interconnected electrical and electronic modules to fulfill direct and indirect needs. In an automated assembly line still, most of these interconnections are required to be done manually due to the large variety of connector types, connector positions, and the soft, flexible nature of their structures. The manual connection points are the source of partial or completely loose connections. Sometimes connections are missed due to the application of unequal mating forces and natural human fatigue. Subsequently, these defects can lead to unexpected downtime and expensive rework. For successful connection detection, past approaches such as vision verification, Augmented Reality, or circuit parameter-based measurements have shown limited ability to detect the correct connection state. Though most connections emit a specific noise for successful mating, the acoustic-based verification system for electrical connection confirmation has not been extensively researched. The main discouraging reason for such research is the typically low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) between the sound of a pair of electrical connector mating and the diverse soundscape of the plant. In this study, the authors investigated increasing the SNR between the electrical connector mating sound and the plant soundscape to improve connection success detection by employing a physical system for background noise mitigation and the successful met noise signature amplification algorithm. The solution is over 75% effective at detecting and classifying connection state. The solution has been constructed without any modification to the existing manual interconnection process.

Title: Listening without Looking: Modality Bias in Audio-Visual Captioning
Authors: Yuchi Ishikawa, Toranosuke Manabe, Tatsuya Komatsu, Yoshimitsu Aoki
Abstract: Audio-visual captioning aims to generate holistic scene descriptions by jointly modeling sound and vision. While recent methods have improved performance through sophisticated modality fusion, it remains unclear to what extent the two modalities are complementary in current audio-visual captioning models and how robust these models are when one modality is degraded. We address these questions by conducting systematic modality robustness tests on LAVCap, a state-of-the-art audio-visual captioning model, in which we selectively suppress or corrupt the audio or visual streams to quantify sensitivity and complementarity. The analysis reveals a pronounced bias toward the audio stream in LAVCap. To evaluate how balanced audio-visual captioning models are in their use of both modalities, we augment AudioCaps with textual annotations that jointly describe the audio and visual streams, yielding the AudioVisualCaps dataset. In our experiments, we report LAVCap baseline results on AudioVisualCaps. We also evaluate the model under modality robustness tests on AudioVisualCaps and the results indicate that LAVCap trained on AudioVisualCaps exhibits less modality bias than when trained on AudioCaps.

Title: PULSE: Privileged Knowledge Transfer from Electrodermal Activity to Low-Cost Sensors for Stress Monitoring
Authors: Zihan Zhao, Masood Mortazavi, Ning Yan
Abstract: Electrodermal activity (EDA), the primary signal for stress detection, requires costly hardware often unavailable in real-world wearables. In this paper, we propose PULSE, a framework that utilizes EDA exclusively during self-supervised pretraining, while enabling inference without EDA but with more readily available modalities such as ECG, BVP, ACC, and TEMP. Our approach separates encoder outputs into shared and private embeddings. We align shared embeddings across modalities and fuse them into a modality-invariant representation. The private embeddings carry modality-specific information to support the reconstruction objective. Pretraining is followed by knowledge transfer where a frozen EDA teacher transfers sympathetic-arousal representations into student encoders. On WESAD, our method achieves strong stress-detection performance, showing that representations of privileged EDA can be transferred to low-cost sensors to improve accuracy while reducing hardware cost.

Title: Performance Analysis of Sub-band Full-duplex Cell-free Massive MIMO JCAS Systems
Authors: Kwadwo Mensah Obeng Afrane, Yang Miao, André B.J. Kokkeler
Abstract: In-band Full-duplex joint communication and sensing systems require self interference cancellation as well as decoupling of the mutual interference between UL communication signals and radar echoes. We present sub-band full-duplex as an alternative duplexing scheme to achieve simultaneous uplink communication and target parameter estimation in a cell-free massive MIMO system. Sub-band full-duplex allows uplink and downlink transmissions simultaneously on non-overlapping frequency resources via explicitly defined uplink and downlink sub-bands in each timeslot. Thus, we propose a sub-band full-duplex cell-free massive MIMO system with active downlink sensing on downlink sub-bands and uplink communication on uplink sub-band. In the proposed system, the target illumination signal is transmitted on the downlink (radar) sub-band whereas uplink users transmit on the uplink (communication) sub-band. By assuming efficient suppression of inter-sub-band interference between radar and communication sub-bands, uplink communication and radar signals can be efficiently processed without mutual interference. We show that each AP can estimate sensing parameters with high accuracy in SBFD cell-free massive MIMO JCAS systems.

Title: Sample-based Moving Horizon Estimation
Authors: Isabelle Krauss, Victor G. Lopez, Matthias A. Müller
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a sample-based moving horizon estimation (MHE) scheme for general nonlinear systems to estimate the current system state using irregularly and/or infrequently available measurements. The cost function of the MHE optimization problem is suitably designed to accommodate these irregular output sequences. We also establish that, under a suitable sample-based detectability condition known as sample-based incremental input/output-to-state stability (i-IOSS), the proposed sample-based MHE achieves robust global exponential stability (RGES). Additionally, for the case of linear systems, we draw connections between sample-based observability and sample-based i-IOSS. This demonstrates that previously established conditions for linear systems to be sample-based observable can be utilized to verify or design sampling strategies that satisfy the conditions to guarantee RGES of the sample-based MHE. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed sample-based MHE is illustrated through a simulation example.

Title: Dual-Domain Constraints: Designing Covert and Efficient Adversarial Examples for Secure Communication
Authors: Tailai Wen, Da Ke, Xiang Wang, Zhitao Huang
Abstract: The advancements in Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) have propelled the development of signal sensing and identification technologies in non-cooperative communication scenarios but also enable eavesdroppers to effectively intercept user signals in wireless communication environments. To protect user privacy in communication links, we have optimized the adversarial example generation model and introduced a novel framework for generating adversarial perturbations for transmitted signals. This framework implements dual-domain constraints in both the time and frequency domains, ensuring that the adversarial perturbation cannot be filtered out. Comparative experiments confirm the superiority of the proposed method and the concealment of the adversarial examples it generates.

Title: Pilot Distortion Design for ToA Obfuscation in Uplink OFDM Communication
Authors: Mahmut Kemal Ercan, Alireza Pourafzal, Musa Furkan Keskin, Sinan Gezici, Henk Wymeersch
Abstract: We study uplink orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) pilot distortion to deliberately obfuscate time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation at a single base station while preserving communication performance. We design a complex per-subcarrier distortion vector that increases sidelobes of the mismatched ambiguity function (MAF) relative to its mainlobe, using two objectives: the sidelobe-to-peak level ratio and the integrated sidelobe level. The design is subject to a transmit-power budget and a proximity (dissimilarity) constraint around the communication-optimal pilot. Communication impact is quantied by a capacity-motivated lower bound obtained from the linear minimum mean-squared error error covariance with a mismatched channel estimate. The resulting generalized fractional program is solved with Dinkelbach's transform and a difference-of-convex update that yields a closed-form Karush-Kuhn-Tucker step. Simulations on a single-input single-output OFDM link show that the optimized distortions raise MAF sidelobes and degrade delay estimation, as validated by a mismatched maximum-likelihood ToA estimator, while incurring only marginal capacity loss over a broad signal-to-noise ratio range. The method requires no protocol changes or artificial path injection and provides a signal-level mechanism to control ToA observability under communication constraints.

Title: A comparison between joint and dual UKF implementations for state estimation and leak localization in water distribution networks
Authors: Luis Romero-Ben, Paul Irofti, Florin Stoican, Vicenç Puig
Abstract: The sustainability of modern cities highly depends on efficient water distribution management, including effective pressure control and leak detection and localization. Accurate information about the network hydraulic state is therefore essential. This article presents a comparison between two data-driven state estimation methods based on the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), fusing pressure, demand and flow data for head and flow estimation. One approach uses a joint state vector with a single estimator, while the other uses a dual-estimator scheme. We analyse their main characteristics, discussing differences, advantages and limitations, and compare them theoretically in terms of accuracy and complexity. Finally, we show several estimation results for the L-TOWN benchmark, allowing to discuss their properties in a real implementation.

Title: Joint Beamforming for Multi-user Multi-target FD ISAC System: A Hybrid GRQ-GA Approach
Authors: Duc Nguyen Dao, Haibin Zhang, Andre B. J. Kokkeler, Yang Miao
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a full-duplex (FD) Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) system, in which the base station (BS) performs downlink and uplink communications with multiple users while simultaneously sensing multiple targets. In the scope of this work, we assume a narrowband and static scenario, aiming to focus on the beamforming and power allocation strategies. We propose a joint beamforming strategy for designing transmit and receive beamformer vectors at the BS. The optimization problem aims to maximize the communication sum-rate, which is critical for ensuring high-quality service to users, while also maintaining accurate sensing performance for detection tasks and adhering to maximum power constraints for efficient resource usage. The optimal receive beamformers are first derived using a closed-form Generalized Rayleigh Quotient (GRQ) solution, reducing the variables to be optimized. Then, the remaining problem is solved using floating-point Genetic Algorithms (GA). The numerical results show that the proposed GA-based solution demonstrates up to a 98% enhancement in sum-rate compared to a baseline half-duplex ISAC system and provides better performance than a benchmark algorithm from the literature. Additionally, it offers insights into sensing performance effects on beam patterns as well as communicationsensing trade-offs in multi-target scenarios.

Title: Trajectory Design for UAV-Based Low-Altitude Wireless Networks in Unknown Environments: A Digital Twin-Assisted TD3 Approach
Authors: Jihao Luo, Zesong Fei, Xinyi Wang, Le Zhao, Yuanhao Cui, Guangxu Zhu, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as key enablers for low-altitude wireless network (LAWN), particularly when terrestrial networks are unavailable. In such scenarios, the environmental topology is typically unknown; hence, designing efficient and safe UAV trajectories is essential yet challenging. To address this, we propose a digital twin (DT)-assisted training and deployment framework. In this framework, the UAV transmits integrated sensing and communication signals to provide communication services to ground users, while simultaneously collecting echoes that are uploaded to the DT server to progressively construct virtual environments (VEs). These VEs accelerate model training and are continuously updated with real-time UAV sensing data during deployment, supporting decision-making and enhancing flight safety. Based on this framework, we further develop a trajectory design scheme that integrates simulated annealing for efficient user scheduling with the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm for continuous trajectory design, aiming to minimize mission completion time while ensuring obstacle avoidance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves faster convergence, higher flight safety, and shorter mission completion time compared with baseline methods, providing a robust and efficient solution for LAWN deployment in unknown environments.

Abstract: Sequential decision making under uncertainty is central to many Process Systems Engineering (PSE) challenges, where traditional methods often face limitations related to controlling and optimizing complex and stochastic systems. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a data-driven approach to derive control policies for such challenges. This paper presents a survey and tutorial on RL methods, tailored for the PSE community. We deliver a tutorial on RL, covering fundamental concepts and key algorithmic families including value-based, policy-based and actor-critic methods. Subsequently, we survey existing applications of these RL techniques across various PSE domains, such as in fed-batch and continuous process control, process optimization, and supply chains. We conclude with PSE focused discussion of specialized techniques and emerging directions. By synthesizing the current state of RL algorithm development and implications for PSE this work identifies successes, challenges, trends, and outlines avenues for future research at the interface of these fields.

Title: Towards actionable hypotension prediction- predicting catecholamine therapy initiation in the intensive care unit
Authors: Richard Koebe, Noah Saibel, Juan Miguel Lopez Alcaraz, Simon Schäfer, Nils Strodthoff
Abstract: Hypotension in critically ill ICU patients is common and life-threatening. Escalation to catecholamine therapy marks a key management step, with both undertreatment and overtreatment posing risks. Most machine learning (ML) models predict hypotension using fixed MAP thresholds or MAP forecasting, overlooking the clinical decision behind treatment escalation. Predicting catecholamine initiation, the start of vasoactive or inotropic agent administration offers a more clinically actionable target reflecting real decision-making. Using the MIMIC-III database, we modeled catecholamine initiation as a binary event within a 15-minute prediction window. Input features included statistical descriptors from a two-hour sliding MAP context window, along with demographics, biometrics, comorbidities, and ongoing treatments. An Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was trained and interpreted via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The model achieved an AUROC of 0.822 (0.813-0.830), outperforming the hypotension baseline (MAP < 65, AUROC 0.686 [0.675-0.699]). SHAP analysis highlighted recent MAP values, MAP trends, and ongoing treatments (e.g., sedatives, electrolytes) as dominant predictors. Subgroup analysis showed higher performance in males, younger patients (<53 years), those with higher BMI (>32), and patients without comorbidities or concurrent medications. Predicting catecholamine initiation based on MAP dynamics, treatment context, and patient characteristics supports the critical decision of when to escalate therapy, shifting focus from threshold-based alarms to actionable decision support. This approach is feasible across a broad ICU cohort under natural event imbalance. Future work should enrich temporal and physiological context, extend label definitions to include therapy escalation, and benchmark against existing hypotension prediction systems.

Title: High-Quality and Large-Scale Image Downscaling for Modern Display Devices
Authors: Suvrojit Mitra, G B Kevin Arjun, Sanjay Ghosh
Abstract: In modern display technology and visualization tools, downscaling images is one of the most important activities. This procedure aims to maintain both visual authenticity and structural integrity while reducing the dimensions of an image at a large scale to fit the dimension of the display devices. In this study, we proposed a new technique for downscaling images that uses co-occurrence learning to maintain structural and perceptual information while reducing resolution. The technique uses the input image to create a data-driven co-occurrence profile that captures the frequency of intensity correlations in nearby neighborhoods. A refined filtering process is guided by this profile, which acts as a content-adaptive range kernel. The contribution of each input pixel is based on how closely it resembles pair-wise intensity values with it's neighbors. We validate our proposed technique on four datasets: DIV2K, BSD100, Urban100, and RealSR to show its effective downscaling capacity. Our technique could obtain up to 39.22 dB PSNR on the DIV2K dataset and PIQE up to 26.35 on the same dataset when downscaling by 8x and 16x, respectively. Numerous experimental findings attest to the ability of the suggested picture downscaling method to outperform more contemporary approaches in terms of both visual quality and performance measures. Unlike most existing methods, which did not focus on the large-scale image resizing scenario, we achieve high-quality downscaled images without texture loss or edge blurring. Our method, LSID (large scale image downscaling), successfully preserves high-frequency structures like edges, textures, and repeating patterns by focusing on statistically consistent pixels while reducing aliasing and blurring artifacts that are typical of traditional downscaling techniques.

Title: Achieving Constant-Envelope Waveform in CP-OFDMA Framework
Authors: Yiming Zhu, Zhuhong Zhu, Xiaodong Xu, Hongwei Hou, Wenjin Wang, Rui Ding
Abstract: OFDM is widely adopted in modern wireless communication systems, but its power efficiency is limited by high envelope fluctuations. Although various high power-efficiency waveforms have been proposed, most are incompatible with the CP-OFDMA framework and remain ineffective in multi-user downlink transmissions. To address this issue, we propose a constant-envelope (CE) waveform design, which enables low-complexity transceiver architectures while maintaining full compatibility with the prevailing CP-OFDMA framework. Specifically, we start from a general CE FDMA signal model and develop a CP-OFDMA-compatible waveform implementation structure, followed by the design of an optimized CE-constrained pulse-shaping filter to suppress out-of-band emissions. To tackle channel estimation challenge under non-flat frequency-domain pilots induced by CE modulation, we optimize the time-domain binary pilot sequence to achieve frequency-domain CE properties, and then propose a multi-stage method combining delay-domain denoising with power delay profile estimation to facilitate reduced-dimension LMMSE estimation. Subsequently, we design a low-complexity maximum ratio combining-aided LMMSE equalizer by exploiting the periodicity and conjugate symmetry of the CE received signals. To mitigate the downlink peak-to-average power ratio increase caused by FDMA, we further develop a multi-user downlink CE transmission scheme including multiple access mechanism, downlink control information design, and corresponding system-level implementation, which ensures compatibility with the New Radio standard. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves bit error rate performance close to the ideal case while significantly reducing transceiver complexity compared to existing CE waveform solutions.

Title: Mechanism-Guided Residual Lifting and Control Consistent Modeling for Pneumatic Drying Processes
Authors: Yue Wu
Abstract: Pneumatic drying processes in industries such as agriculture, chemicals,and pharmaceuticals are notoriously difficult to model and control due to multi-source disturbances,coupled stage dynamics, and significant measurement delays. Traditional modeling paradigms often fail to simultaneously deliver accuracy, interpretability, and closed-loop applicability. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a unified hybrid modeling framework, termed Physics-Guided Residual Lifting with Control-Consistent Correction,which integrates a transient mechanistic model with a stability-constrained data-driven component. The framework covers the complete process chain of drying, transport, and winnowing. On the mechanistic level, the model unifies mass transfer dynamics using the partial pressure difference of water vapor, incorporates water activity clamping and latent heat corrections for bound water, and ensures energy closure with moisture-dependent specific heat. On the data-driven level,we propose an orthogonal residual learning scheme. It leverages intermediate states from the mechanistic model as proxy variables to construct a physics-inspired dictionary, preventing parameter compensation and overfitting during ridge regression. Furthermore, to ensure suitability for predictive control, a Control-Consistent Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition with stability constraints is employed to learn the residual dynamics, for which we provide boundedness proofs and stability guarantees. The framework was validated on 10 industrial batches, comprising 63,000 samples. On unseen test data, the hybrid model achieved a Mean Absolute Error of 0.016% for outlet moisture and 0.015 °C for outlet temperature, with values improving to 0.986 and 0.995, respectively. The resulting prediction residuals exhibit white-noise characteristics, with significantly reduced spectral energy at low frequencies.

Title: Development of a Digital Twin for an Electric Vehicle Emulator Modeling, Control, and Experimental Validation
Authors: Lamine Chalal, Ahmed Rachid
Abstract: This paper presents the development and validation of a digital twin for a scaled-down electric vehicle (EV) emulator, designed to replicate longitudinal vehicle dynamics under diverse operating conditions. The emulator integrates a separately excited DC motor (SEDCM), a four-quadrant DC-DC converter, a battery emulator, and a mechanical load emulator. The system models tractive effort, aerodynamic drag, and gradient resistance using Newton's second law. In contrast to conventional graphical modeling tools (e.g., block diagrams and bond graphs), the adopted Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR) framework offers clear advantages by explicitly representing energy interactions and facilitating the systematic derivation of control structures. A control strategy developed within this framework governs energy flow across the powertrain, enabling accurate speed control via armature voltage regulation. Experimental tests conducted on a Lucas-Nulle test bench show strong correlation with simulation results. The study also introduces a methodology to compute the maximum admissible vehicle mass - determined to be 13.5 kg for a 180 W motor operating at 1900 rpm - based on acceleration and slope constraints. Furthermore, a switching algorithm for the bidirectional converter ensures reliable four quadrant operation. Overall, the proposed framework provides a scalable and effective approach for EV emulation, control design, and energy management validation.

Title: Contributions to Semialgebraic-Set-Based Stability Verification of Dynamical Systems with Neural-Network-Based Controllers
Authors: Alvaro Detailleur, Dalim Wahby, Guillaume Ducard, Christopher Onder
Abstract: Neural-network-based controllers (NNCs) can represent complex, highly nonlinear control laws, but verifying the closed-loop stability of dynamical systems using them remains challenging. This work presents contributions to a state-of-the-art stability verification procedure for NNC-controlled systems which relies on semialgebraic-set-based input-output modeling to pose the search for a Lyapunov function as an optimization problem. Specifically, this procedure's conservatism when analyzing NNCs using transcendental activation functions and the restriction to feedforward NNCs are addressed by a) introducing novel semialgebraic activation functions that preserve key properties of common transcendental activations and b) proving compatibility of NNCs from the broader class of recurrent equilibrium networks (RENs) with this procedure. Furthermore, the indirect optimization of a local region of attraction (RoA) estimate using a restricted set of candidate Lyapunov functions is greatly improved via c) the introduction of a richer parameterization of candidate Lyapunov functions than previously reported and d) the formulation of novel semidefinite programs (SDPs) that directly optimize the resulting RoA estimate. The value of these contributions is highlighted in two numerical examples.

Title: Deep Learning-Based CSI Prediction Framework for Channel Aging Mitigation in TDD 5G Systems
Authors: Francisco Díaz-Ruiz, Francisco J. Martín-Vega, José Antonio Cortés, Gerardo Gómez, Mari Carmen Aguayo-Torres
Abstract: Time division duplexing (TDD) has become the dominant duplexing mode in 5G and beyond due to its ability to exploit channel reciprocity for efficient downlink channel state information (CSI) acquisition. However, channel aging caused by user mobility and processing delays degrades the accuracy of CSI, leading to suboptimal link adaptation and loss of performance. To address this issue, we propose a learning-based CSI prediction framework that leverages temporal correlations in wireless channels to forecast future signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) values. The prediction operates in the effective SINR domain, obtained via exponential effective SINR mapping (EESM), ensuring full compatibility with existing 5G standards without requiring continuous pilot signaling. Two models are considered: a fully connected deep neural network (DNN) and an long short-term memory (LSTM)-based network. The simulation results show that the LSTM predictor achieves an improvement of up to 2 dB in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) and a gain of up to 1.2 Mbps throughput over a baseline without prediction under moderate Doppler conditions. These results confirm the potential of lightweight AI-based CSI prediction to effectively mitigate channel aging and enhance link adaptation in TDD 5G systems.

Title: Analyzing Parametric Oscillator Ising Machines through the Kuramoto Lens
Authors: Nikhat Khan, E.M.H.E.B. Ekanayake, Nicolas Casilli, Cristian Cassella, Luke Theogarajan, Nikhil Shukla
Abstract: Networks of coupled nonlinear oscillators are emerging as powerful physical platforms for implementing Ising machines. Yet the relationship between parametric-oscillator implementations and traditional oscillator-based Ising machines remains underexplored. In this work, we develop a Kuramoto-style, canonical phase description of parametric oscillator Ising machines by starting from the Stuart-Landau oscillator model- the canonical normal form near a Hopf bifurcation, and a natural reduced description for many parametric oscillator implementations such as the degenerate optical parametric oscillator (DOPO) among others. The resulting phase dynamics combine the usual phase-difference coupling observed in the standard Kuramoto model along with an intrinsic phase sum term that is generated when conjugate coupling is considered. Moreover, our formulation helps explain why explicit second-harmonic driving is unnecessary in parametric oscillators and also reveals how quasi-steady amplitude heterogeneity scales the original strength of the spin interaction with potentially adverse impacts on the solution quality. Our work helps develop a unifying view of the oscillator-based approach to designing Ising machines.

Title: Forward Convolutive Prediction for Frame Online Monaural Speech Dereverberation Based on Kronecker Product Decomposition
Authors: Yujie Zhu, Jilu Jin, Xueqin Luo, Wenxing Yang, Zhong-Qiu Wang, Gongping Huang, Jingdong Chen, Jacob Benesty
Abstract: Dereverberation has long been a crucial research topic in speech processing, aiming to alleviate the adverse effects of reverberation in voice communication and speech interaction systems. Among existing approaches, forward convolutional prediction (FCP) has recently attracted attention. It typically employs a deep neural network to predict the direct-path signal and subsequently estimates a linear prediction filter to suppress residual reverberation. However, a major drawback of this approach is that the required linear prediction filter is often excessively long, leading to considerable computational complexity. To address this, our work proposes a novel FCP method based on Kronecker product (KP) decomposition, in which the long prediction filter is modeled as the KP of two much shorter filters. This decomposition significantly reduces the computational cost. An adaptive algorithm is then provided to iteratively update these shorter filters online. Experimental results show that, compared to conventional methods, our approach achieves competitive dereverberation performance while substantially reducing computational cost.

Title: Diffusion Models for Wireless Transceivers: From Pilot-Efficient Channel Estimation to AI-Native 6G Receivers
Authors: Yuzhi Yang, Sen Yan, Weijie Zhou, Brahim Mefgouda, Ridong Li, Zhaoyang Zhang, Mérouane Debbah
Abstract: With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, implementing AI-based techniques to improve wireless transceivers becomes an emerging research topic. Within this context, AI-based channel characterization and estimation become the focus since these methods have not been solved by traditional methods very well and have become the bottleneck of transceiver efficiency in large-scale orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Specifically, by formulating channel estimation as a generative AI problem, generative AI methods such as diffusion models (DMs) can efficiently deal with rough initial estimations and have great potential to cooperate with traditional signal processing methods. This paper focuses on the transceiver design of OFDM systems based on DMs, provides an illustration of the potential of DMs in wireless transceivers, and points out the related research directions brought by DMs. We also provide a proof-of-concept case study of further adapting DMs for better wireless receiver performance.

Title: Quality Coefficients for Interferometric Phase Linking
Authors: Magnus Heimpel, Irena Hajnsek, Othmar Frey
Abstract: In multi-temporal InSAR, phase linking refers to the estimation of a single-reference interferometric phase history from the information contained in the coherence matrix of a distributed scatterer. Since the phase information in the coherence matrix is typically inconsistent, the extent to which the estimated phase history captures it must be assessed to exclude unreliable pixels from further processing. We introduce three quality criteria in the form of coefficients, for threshold-based pixel selection: a coefficient based on closure phase that quantifies the internal consistency of the phase information in the coherence matrix; a goodness-of-fit coefficient that quantifies how well a resulting phase history estimate approximates the phase information according to the characteristic optimization model of a given phase linking method; and an ambiguity coefficient that compares the goodness of fit of the original estimate with that of an orthogonal alternative. We formulate the phase linking methods and these criteria within a unified mathematical framework and discuss computational and algorithmic aspects. Unlike existing goodness-of-fit indicators, the proposed coefficients are normalized to the unit interval with explicit noise-floor correction, improving interpretability across stacks of different size. Experiments on TerraSAR-X data over Visp, Switzerland, indicate that the closure phase coefficient effectively pre-screens stable areas, the goodness-of-fit coefficient aligns with and systematically generalizes established quality indicators, and the ambiguity coefficient flags solutions that fit well but are unstable. Together, the coefficients enable systematic pixel selection and quality control in the interferometric processing of distributed scatterers.

Title: Advanced Closed-Loop Method with Limited Feedback for ISAC
Authors: Ashkan Jafari Fesharaki, Yasser Mestrah, Yi Ma, Rahim Tafazolli, Ibrahim Hemadeh, Mohammad Heggo, Arman Shojaeifard, Javier Lorca Hernando, Alain Mourad
Abstract: 6G wireless networks are poised to seamlessly integrate communication, computing, localization, and sensing functionalities, ensuring high reliability and trustworthiness. This paper introduces Smart Sensing Feedback (SSF), a limited-feedback framework designed to enhance sensing capabilities while maintaining communication performance. SSF adapts the concept of retransmission from communication to sensing. Specifically, we focus on downlink (DL) bistatic sensing, where the User Equipment (UE) performs measurements from reflected sensing signals and provides feedback to the network (NW). In sensing services, UE reporting can vary significantly due to dynamic factors such as target characteristics, environmental conditions, and UE status. Our results demonstrate that SSF significantly improves sensing quality while preserving communication efficiency. Additionally, it enhances key performance metrics such as probability of detection, latency, and power consumption. These improvements underscore SSF's ability to deliver robust, low-overhead feedback and adaptability to support a wide range of ISAC applications.

Title: Multifunctional Wideband Digital Metasurface for Secure Electromagnetic Manipulation in S-Band
Authors: Longpan Wang, Zhuoran Zhang, Zhenyuan Li, Xuetao Gan, Xudong Bai, Wen Chen, Qingqing Wu
Abstract: Digital metasurfaces have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their ability to manipulate electromagnetic (EM) waves for secure sensing and communication. However, most reported metasurfaces operate at relatively high frequencies, primarily due to the constraints imposed by the physical scale of the dielectric substrate, thus limiting their full-wave system applications. In this work, a wideband digital reflective metasurface is presented for capable of dynamically controlling EM waves, with multifunctional applications in the lower-frequency S-band. The metasurface is composed of electronically reconfigurable meta-atoms with wideband characteristics, and designed by using trapezoidal and M-shaped patches connected by a pin diode. Simulation results show that the proposed digital metasurface could achieve wideband 1-bit phase quantization with a stable phase difference within 180 degree +/- 25 degree and small reflection loss below 0.6 dB from 2.72 to 3.25 GHz. To validate the proposed design, a 20x20-unit metasurface array was designed, simulated and fabricated. By dynamically adjusting the coding sequence, the metasurface could enable multi-mode orbital angular momentum (OAM) beam generation, dynamic beam scanning, and precise direction finding. These capabilities support secure sensing and secure communications through high-resolution target detection and anti-jamming beam steering, as well as physical-layer security. The proposed wideband metasurface may serve as an effective candidate for enhancing spectral efficiency and security performance in radar and wireless systems.

Title: Fast algorithms enabling optimization and deep learning for photoacoustic tomography in a circular detection geometry
Authors: Andreas Hauptmann, Leonid Kunyansky, Jenni Poimala
Abstract: The inverse source problem arising in photoacoustic tomography and in several other coupled-physics modalities is frequently solved by iterative algorithms. Such algorithms are based on the minimization of a certain cost functional. In addition, novel deep learning techniques are currently being investigated to further improve such optimization approaches. All such methods require multiple applications of the operator defining the forward problem, and of its adjoint. In this paper, we present new asymptotically fast algorithms for numerical evaluation of the forward and adjoint operators, applicable in the circular acquisition geometry. For an $(n \times n)$ image, our algorithms compute these operators in $\mathcal{O}(n^2 \log n)$ floating point operations. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithms in numerical simulations, where they are used as an integral part of several iterative image reconstruction techniques: classic variational methods, such as non-negative least squares and total variation regularized least squares, as well as deep learning methods, such as learned primal dual. A Python implementation of our algorithms and computational examples is available to the general public.

Title: Dipole-lets: a new multiscale decomposition for MR phase and quantitative susceptibility mapping
Authors: Ignacio Contreras-Zúñiga, Mathias Lambert, Benjamín Palacios, Cristian Tejos, Carlos Milovic
Abstract: Identifying and suppressing streaking artifacts is one of the most challenging problems in quantitative susceptibility mapping. The measured phase from tissue magnetization is assumed to be the convolution by the magnetic dipole kernel; direct inversion or standard regularization methods tend to create streaking artifacts in the estimated susceptibility. This is caused by extreme noise and by the presence of non-dipolar phase contributions, which are amplified by the dipole kernel following the streaking pattern. In this work, we introduce a multiscale transform, called Dipole-lets, as an optimal decomposition method for identifying dipole incompatibilities in measured field data by extracting features of different characteristic size and orientation with respect to the dipole kernel's zero-valued double-cone surface (the magic cone). We provide experiments that showcase that non-dipolar content can be extracted by Dipole-lets from phase data through artifact localization. We also present implementations of Dipole-lets as a optimization functional regularizator, through simple Tikhonov and infinity norm.

Title: Feedback Lunch: Deep Feedback Codes for Wiretap Channels
Authors: Yingyao Zhou, Natasha Devroye, Onur Günlü
Abstract: We consider reversely-degraded wiretap channels, for which the secrecy capacity is zero if there is no channel feedback. This work focuses on a seeded modular code design for the Gaussian wiretap channel with channel output feedback, combining universal hash functions for security and learned feedback-based codes for reliability to achieve positive secrecy rates. We study the trade-off between communication reliability and information leakage, illustrating that feedback enables agreeing on a secret key shared between legitimate parties, overcoming the security advantage of the wiretapper. Our findings also motivate code designs for sensing-assisted secure communication, to be used in next-generation integrated sensing and communication methods.

Title: Noise is All You Need: Solving Linear Inverse Problems by Noise Combination Sampling with Diffusion Models
Authors: Xun Su, Hiroyuki Kasai
Abstract: Pretrained diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in zero-shot inverse problem solving by incorporating observation information into the generation process of the diffusion models. However, this presents an inherent dilemma: excessive integration can disrupt the generative process, while insufficient integration fails to emphasize the constraints imposed by the inverse problem. To address this, we propose \emph{Noise Combination Sampling}, a novel method that synthesizes an optimal noise vector from a noise subspace to approximate the measurement score, replacing the noise term in the standard Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models process. This enables conditional information to be naturally embedded into the generation process without reliance on step-wise hyperparameter tuning. Our method can be applied to a wide range of inverse problem solvers, including image compression, and, particularly when the number of generation steps $T$ is small, achieves superior performance with negligible computational overhead, significantly improving robustness and stability.

Abstract: Non-invasive colorectal cancer (CRC) screening represents a key opportunity to improve colonoscopy participation rates and reduce CRC mortality. This study explores the potential of the gut-liver axis for predicting colorectal neoplasia through liver-derived radiomic features extracted from routine CT images as a novel opportunistic screening approach. In this retrospective study, we analyzed data from 1,997 patients who underwent colonoscopy and abdominal CT. Patients either had no colorectal neoplasia (n=1,189) or colorectal neoplasia (n_total=808; adenomas n=423, CRC n=385). Radiomics features were extracted from 3D liver segmentations using the Radiomics Processing ToolKit (RPTK), which performed feature extraction, filtering, and classification. The dataset was split into training (n=1,397) and test (n=600) cohorts. Five machine learning models were trained with 5-fold cross-validation on the 20 most informative features, and the best model ensemble was selected based on the validation AUROC. The best radiomics-based XGBoost model achieved a test AUROC of 0.810, clearly outperforming the best clinical-only model (test AUROC: 0.457). Subclassification between colorectal cancer and adenoma showed lower accuracy (test AUROC: 0.674). Our findings establish proof-of-concept that liver-derived radiomics from routine abdominal CT can predict colorectal neoplasia. Beyond offering a pragmatic, widely accessible adjunct to CRC screening, this approach highlights the gut-liver axis as a novel biomarker source for opportunistic screening and sparks new mechanistic hypotheses for future translational research.

Title: Switching Network System Identification via Convex Optimizations
Authors: Kaito Iwasaki, Anthony Bloch, Maani Ghaffari
Abstract: This paper introduces a convex optimization framework for identifying switched network systems, in which both the node dynamics and the underlying graph topology switch between a finite number of configurations. Building on our recent convex identification method for general switching systems, we extend the formulation to structured network systems where each mode corresponds to a distinct adjacency matrix. We show that both the continuous node dynamics and binary network topologies can be identified from sampled state-velocity data by solving a sequence of convex programs. The proposed framework provides a unified and scalable way to recover piecewise network structures from data without a prior knowledge of mode labels at each state. Numerical results on diffusively coupled oscillators demonstrate accurate recovery of both mode dynamics and switching graphs.

Title: Explainable Detection of AI-Generated Images with Artifact Localization Using Faster-Than-Lies and Vision-Language Models for Edge Devices
Authors: Aryan Mathur, Asaduddin Ahmed, Pushti Amit Vasoya, Simeon Kandan Sonar, Yasir Z, Madesh Kuppusamy
Abstract: The increasing realism of AI-generated imagery poses challenges for verifying visual authenticity. We present an explainable image authenticity detection system that combines a lightweight convolutional classifier ("Faster-Than-Lies") with a Vision-Language Model (Qwen2-VL-7B) to classify, localize, and explain artifacts in 32x32 images. Our model achieves 96.5% accuracy on the extended CiFAKE dataset augmented with adversarial perturbations and maintains an inference time of 175ms on 8-core CPUs, enabling deployment on local or edge devices. Using autoencoder-based reconstruction error maps, we generate artifact localization heatmaps, which enhance interpretability for both humans and the VLM. We further categorize 70 visual artifact types into eight semantic groups and demonstrate explainable text generation for each detected anomaly. This work highlights the feasibility of combining visual and linguistic reasoning for interpretable authenticity detection in low-resolution imagery and outlines potential cross-domain applications in forensics, industrial inspection, and social media moderation.

Title: EthVault: A Secure and Resource-Conscious FPGA-Based Ethereum Cold Wallet
Authors: Joel Poncha Lemayian, Ghyslain Gagnon, Kaiwen Zhang, Pascal Giard
Abstract: Cryptocurrency blockchain networks safeguard digital assets using cryptographic keys, with wallets playing a critical role in generating, storing, and managing these keys. Wallets, typically categorized as hot and cold, offer varying degrees of security and convenience. However, they are generally software-based applications running on microcontrollers. Consequently, they are vulnerable to malware and side-channel attacks, allowing perpetrators to extract private keys by targeting critical algorithms, such as ECC, which processes private keys to generate public keys and authorize transactions. To address these issues, this work presents EthVault, the first hardware architecture for an Ethereum hierarchically deterministic cold wallet, featuring hardware implementations of key algorithms for secure key generation. Also, an ECC architecture resilient to side-channel and timing attacks is proposed. Moreover, an architecture of the child key derivation function, a fundamental component of cryptocurrency wallets, is proposed. The design minimizes resource usage, meeting market demand for small, portable cryptocurrency wallets. FPGA implementation results validate the feasibility of the proposed approach. The ECC architecture exhibits uniform execution behavior across varying inputs, while the complete design utilizes only 27%, 7%, and 6% of LUTs, registers, and RAM blocks, respectively, on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ FPGA.

Title: Optimized Loudspeaker Panning for Adaptive Sound-Field Correction and Non-stationary Listening Areas
Authors: Yuancheng Luo
Abstract: Surround sound systems commonly distribute loudspeakers along standardized layouts for multichannel audio reproduction. However in less controlled environments, practical layouts vary in loudspeaker quantity, placement, and listening locations / areas. Deviations from standard layouts introduce sound-field errors that degrade acoustic timbre, imaging, and clarity of audio content reproduction. This work introduces both Bayesian loudspeaker normalization and content panning optimization methods for sound-field correction. Conjugate prior distributions over loudspeaker-listener directions update estimated layouts for non-stationary listening locations; digital filters adapt loudspeaker acoustic responses to a common reference target at the estimated listening area without acoustic measurements. Frequency-domain panning coefficients are then optimized via sensitivity / efficiency objectives subject to spatial, electrical, and acoustic domain constraints; normalized and panned loudspeakers form virtual loudspeakers in standardized layouts for accurate multichannel reproduction. Experiments investigate robustness of Bayesian adaptation, and panning optimizations in practical applications.

Title: emg2speech: synthesizing speech from electromyography using self-supervised speech models
Authors: Harshavardhana T. Gowda, Lee M. Miller
Abstract: We present a neuromuscular speech interface that translates electromyographic (EMG) signals collected from orofacial muscles during speech articulation directly into audio. We show that self-supervised speech (SS) representations exhibit a strong linear relationship with the electrical power of muscle action potentials: SS features can be linearly mapped to EMG power with a correlation of $r = 0.85$. Moreover, EMG power vectors corresponding to different articulatory gestures form structured and separable clusters in feature space. This relationship: $\text{SS features}$ $\xrightarrow{\texttt{linear mapping}}$ $\text{EMG power}$ $\xrightarrow{\texttt{gesture-specific clustering}}$ $\text{articulatory movements}$, highlights that SS models implicitly encode articulatory mechanisms. Leveraging this property, we directly map EMG signals to SS feature space and synthesize speech, enabling end-to-end EMG-to-speech generation without explicit articulatory models and vocoder training.

Title: Improved Accuracy of Robot Localization Using 3-D LiDAR in a Hippocampus-Inspired Model
Authors: Andrew Gerstenslager, Bekarys Dukenbaev, Ali A. Minai
Abstract: Boundary Vector Cells (BVCs) are a class of neurons in the brains of vertebrates that encode environmental boundaries at specific distances and allocentric directions, playing a central role in forming place fields in the hippocampus. Most computational BVC models are restricted to two-dimensional (2D) environments, making them prone to spatial ambiguities in the presence of horizontal symmetries in the environment. To address this limitation, we incorporate vertical angular sensitivity into the BVC framework, thereby enabling robust boundary detection in three dimensions, and leading to significantly more accurate spatial localization in a biologically-inspired robot model. The proposed model processes LiDAR data to capture vertical contours, thereby disambiguating locations that would be indistinguishable under a purely 2D representation. Experimental results show that in environments with minimal vertical variation, the proposed 3D model matches the performance of a 2D baseline; yet, as 3D complexity increases, it yields substantially more distinct place fields and markedly reduces spatial aliasing. These findings show that adding a vertical dimension to BVC-based localization can significantly enhance navigation and mapping in real-world 3D spaces while retaining performance parity in simpler, near-planar scenarios.

Title: Model-Guided Dual-Role Alignment for High-Fidelity Open-Domain Video-to-Audio Generation
Authors: Kang Zhang, Trung X. Pham, Suyeon Lee, Axi Niu, Arda Senocak, Joon Son Chung
Abstract: We present MGAudio, a novel flow-based framework for open-domain video-to-audio generation, which introduces model-guided dual-role alignment as a central design principle. Unlike prior approaches that rely on classifier-based or classifier-free guidance, MGAudio enables the generative model to guide itself through a dedicated training objective designed for video-conditioned audio generation. The framework integrates three main components: (1) a scalable flow-based Transformer model, (2) a dual-role alignment mechanism where the audio-visual encoder serves both as a conditioning module and as a feature aligner to improve generation quality, and (3) a model-guided objective that enhances cross-modal coherence and audio realism. MGAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance on VGGSound, reducing FAD to 0.40, substantially surpassing the best classifier-free guidance baselines, and consistently outperforms existing methods across FD, IS, and alignment metrics. It also generalizes well to the challenging UnAV-100 benchmark. These results highlight model-guided dual-role alignment as a powerful and scalable paradigm for conditional video-to-audio generation.

Title: What Can Be Recovered Under Sparse Adversarial Corruption? Assumption-Free Theory for Linear Measurements
Authors: Vishal Halder (IMT Atlantique - INFO, Lab-STICC), Alexandre Reiffers-Masson (IMT Atlantique - INFO, Lab-STICC), Abdeldjalil Aïssa-El-Bey (IMT Atlantique - MEE, Lab-STICC), Gugan Thoppe (CSA, IISc)
Abstract: Let \(\bm{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}\) be an arbitrary, known matrix and \(\bm{e}\) a \(q\)-sparse adversarial vector. Given \(\bm{y} = \bm{A} x^* + \bm{e}\) and \(q\), we seek the smallest set containing \(x^*\)-hence the one conveying maximal information about \(x^*\)-that is uniformly recoverable from \(\bm{y}\) without knowing \(\bm{e}\). While exact recovery of \(x^*\) via strong (and often impractical) structural assumptions on \(\bm{A}\) or \(x^*\) (for example, restricted isometry, sparsity) is well studied, recoverability for arbitrary \(\bm{A}\) and \(x^*\) remains open. Our main result shows that the best that one can hope to recover is \(x^* + \ker(\bm{U})\), where \(\bm{U}\) is the unique projection matrix onto the intersection of rowspaces of all possible submatrices of \(\bm{A}\) obtained by deleting \(2q\) rows. Moreover, we prove that every \(x\) that minimizes the \(\ell\_0\)-norm of \(\bm{y} - \bm{A} x\) lies in \(x^* + \ker(\bm{U})\), which then gives a constructive approach to recover this set.

Authors: Matteo Calafà, Yuanxin Xia, Cheol-Ho Jeong
Abstract: We present a novel neural network architecture for the efficient prediction of sound fields in two and three dimensions. The network is designed to automatically satisfy the Helmholtz equation, ensuring that the outputs are physically valid. Therefore, the method can effectively learn solutions to boundary-value problems in various wave phenomena, such as acoustics, optics, and electromagnetism. Numerical experiments show that the proposed strategy can potentially outperform state-of-the-art methods in room acoustics simulation, in particular in the range of mid to high frequencies.

Title: TsetlinKWS: A 65nm 16.58uW, 0.63mm2 State-Driven Convolutional Tsetlin Machine-Based Accelerator For Keyword Spotting
Authors: Baizhou Lin, Yuetong Fang, Renjing Xu, Rishad Shafik, Jagmohan Chauhan
Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) has recently attracted attention as a low-power alternative to neural networks due to its simple and interpretable inference mechanisms. However, its performance on speech-related tasks remains limited. This paper proposes TsetlinKWS, the first algorithm-hardware co-design framework for the Convolutional Tsetlin Machine (CTM) on the 12-keyword spotting task. Firstly, we introduce a novel Mel-Frequency Spectral Coefficient and Spectral Flux (MFSC-SF) feature extraction scheme together with spectral convolution, enabling the CTM to reach its first-ever competitive accuracy of 87.35% on the 12-keyword spotting task. Secondly, we develop an Optimized Grouped Block-Compressed Sparse Row (OG-BCSR) algorithm that achieves a remarkable 9.84$\times$ reduction in model size, significantly improving the storage efficiency on CTMs. Finally, we propose a state-driven architecture tailored for the CTM, which simultaneously exploits data reuse and sparsity to achieve high energy efficiency. The full system is evaluated in 65 nm process technology, consuming 16.58 $\mu$W at 0.7 V with a compact 0.63 mm$^2$ core area. TsetlinKWS requires only 907k logic operations per inference, representing a 10$\times$ reduction compared to the state-of-the-art KWS accelerators, positioning the CTM as a highly-efficient candidate for ultra-low-power speech applications.

Title: Sound Source Localization for Spatial Mapping of Surgical Actions in Dynamic Scenes
Authors: Jonas Hein, Lazaros Vlachopoulos, Maurits Geert Laurent Olthof, Bastian Sigrist, Philipp Fürnstahl, Matthias Seibold
Abstract: Purpose: Surgical scene understanding is key to advancing computer-aided and intelligent surgical systems. Current approaches predominantly rely on visual data or end-to-end learning, which limits fine-grained contextual modeling. This work aims to enhance surgical scene representations by integrating 3D acoustic information, enabling temporally and spatially aware multimodal understanding of surgical environments. Methods: We propose a novel framework for generating 4D audio-visual representations of surgical scenes by projecting acoustic localization information from a phased microphone array onto dynamic point clouds from an RGB-D camera. A transformer-based acoustic event detection module identifies relevant temporal segments containing tool-tissue interactions which are spatially localized in the audio-visual scene representation. The system was experimentally evaluated in a realistic operating room setup during simulated surgical procedures performed by experts. Results: The proposed method successfully localizes surgical acoustic events in 3D space and associates them with visual scene elements. Experimental evaluation demonstrates accurate spatial sound localization and robust fusion of multimodal data, providing a comprehensive, dynamic representation of surgical activity. Conclusion: This work introduces the first approach for spatial sound localization in dynamic surgical scenes, marking a significant advancement toward multimodal surgical scene representations. By integrating acoustic and visual data, the proposed framework enables richer contextual understanding and provides a foundation for future intelligent and autonomous surgical systems.

Title: An N-of-1 Artificial Intelligence Ecosystem for Precision Medicine
Authors: Pedram Fard, Alaleh Azhir, Neguine Rezaii, Jiazi Tian, Hossein Estiri
Abstract: Artificial intelligence in medicine is built to serve the average patient. By minimizing error across large datasets, most systems deliver strong aggregate accuracy yet falter at the margins: patients with rare variants, multimorbidity, or underrepresented demographics. This average patient fallacy erodes both equity and trust. We propose a different design: a multi-agent ecosystem for N-of-1 decision support. In this environment, agents clustered by organ systems, patient populations, and analytic modalities draw on a shared library of models and evidence synthesis tools. Their results converge in a coordination layer that weighs reliability, uncertainty, and data density before presenting the clinician with a decision-support packet: risk estimates bounded by confidence ranges, outlier flags, and linked evidence. Validation shifts from population averages to individual reliability, measured by error in low-density regions, calibration in the small, and risk--coverage trade-offs. Anticipated challenges include computational demands, automation bias, and regulatory fit, addressed through caching strategies, consensus checks, and adaptive trial frameworks. By moving from monolithic models to orchestrated intelligence, this approach seeks to align medical AI with the first principle of medicine: care that is transparent, equitable, and centered on the individual.

Title: Bayesian Speech synthesizers Can Learn from Multiple Teachers
Authors: Ziyang Zhang, Yifan Gao, Xuenan Xu, Baoxiangli, Wen Wu, Chao Zhang
Abstract: Codec-based text-to-speech (TTS) models have recently gained traction for their efficiency and strong performance in voice cloning. However, codec-based TTS faces limitations due to the challenges of pretraining robust speech codecs and the quality degradation introduced by quantization errors. Emerging evidence suggests that continuous-valued generative models can alleviate these issues and serve as a promising alternative. Yet, effectively modelling diverse speech patterns and developing reliable sampling strategies for continuous-valued autoregressive (AR) TTS remains underexplored. In this work, we propose BELLE, Bayesian evidential learning with language modelling for TTS, a novel continuous-valued AR framework that directly predicts mel-spectrograms from textual input. BELLE treats each mel-spectrogram frame as a Gaussian distribution sampled from a learned hyper distribution, enabling principled uncertainty estimation, particularly in scenarios with parallel data (i.e., one text-audio prompt paired with multiple speech samples). To obtain such data, diverse speech samples are synthesized using multiple pre-trained TTS models given the same text-audio prompts, which are distilled into BELLE via Bayesian evidential learning. Experimental results indicate that BELLE demonstrates highly competitive performance compared with the current best open-source TTS models, even though BELLE is trained on a large amount of synthetic data and uses only approximately one-tenth of their training data. Audio samples generated by BELLE are available at this https URL. The code, checkpoints, and synthetic data will be released after the paper is accepted.

Title: Your Microphone Array Retains Your Identity: A Robust Voice Liveness Detection System for Smart Speakers
Authors: Yan Meng, Jiachun Li, Matthew Pillari, Arjun Deopujari, Liam Brennan, Hafsah Shamsie, Haojin Zhu, Yuan Tian
Abstract: Though playing an essential role in smart home systems, smart speakers are vulnerable to voice spoofing attacks. Passive liveness detection, which utilizes only the collected audio rather than the deployed sensors to distinguish between live-human and replayed voices, has drawn increasing attention. However, it faces the challenge of performance degradation under the different environmental factors as well as the strict requirement of the fixed user gestures. In this study, we propose a novel liveness feature, array fingerprint, which utilizes the microphone array inherently adopted by the smart speaker to determine the identity of collected audios. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that by leveraging the circular layout of microphones, compared with existing schemes, array fingerprint achieves a more robust performance under the environmental change and user's movement. Then, to leverage such a fingerprint, we propose ARRAYID, a lightweight passive detection scheme, and elaborate a series of features working together with array fingerprint. Our evaluation on the dataset containing 32,780 audio samples and 14 spoofing devices shows that ARRAYID achieves an accuracy of 99.84%, which is superior to existing passive liveness detection schemes.

Title: Flatness-based trajectory planning for 3D overhead cranes with friction compensation and collision avoidance
Authors: Jorge Vicente-Martinez (1), Edgar Ramirez-Laboreo (1) ((1) Universidad de Zaragoza)
Abstract: This paper presents an optimal trajectory generation method for 3D overhead cranes by leveraging differential flatness. This framework enables the direct inclusion of complex physical and dynamic constraints, such as nonlinear friction and collision avoidance for both payload and rope. Our approach allows for aggressive movements by constraining payload swing only at the final point. A comparative simulation study validates our approach, demonstrating that neglecting dry friction leads to actuator saturation and collisions. The results show that friction modeling is a fundamental requirement for fast and safe crane trajectories.

Title: Efficient Network Reconfiguration by Randomized Switching
Authors: Samuel Talkington, Dmitrii M. Ostrovskii, Daniel K. Molzahn
Abstract: We present an algorithm that efficiently computes nearly-optimal solutions to a class of combinatorial reconfiguration problems on weighted, undirected graphs. Inspired by societally relevant applications in networked infrastructure systems, these problems consist of simultaneously finding an unreweighted sparsified graph and nodal potentials that satisfy fixed demands, where the objective is to minimize some congestion criterion, e.g., a Laplacian quadratic form. These are mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems that are NP-hard in general. To circumvent these challenges, instead of solving for a single best configuration, the proposed randomized switching algorithm seeks to design a distribution of configurations that, when sampled, ensures that congestion concentrates around its optimum. We show that the proposed congestion metric is a generalized self-concordant function in the space of switching probabilities, which enables the use of efficient and simple conditional gradient methods. We implement our algorithm and show that it outperforms a state-of-the-art commercial mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) solver by orders of magnitude over a large range of problem sizes.

Title: Online neural fusion of distortionless differential beamformers for robust speech enhancement
Authors: Yuanhang Qian, Kunlong Zhao, Jilu Jin, Xueqin Luo, Gongping Huang, Jingdong Chen, Jacob Benesty
Abstract: Fixed beamforming is widely used in practice since it does not depend on the estimation of noise statistics and provides relatively stable performance. However, a single beamformer cannot adapt to varying acoustic conditions, which limits its interference suppression capability. To address this, adaptive convex combination (ACC) algorithms have been introduced, where the outputs of multiple fixed beamformers are linearly combined to improve robustness. Nevertheless, ACC often fails in highly non-stationary scenarios, such as rapidly moving interference, since its adaptive updates cannot reliably track rapid changes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a frame-online neural fusion framework for multiple distortionless differential beamformers, which estimates the combination weights through a neural network. Compared with conventional ACC, the proposed method adapts more effectively to dynamic acoustic environments, achieving stronger interference suppression while maintaining the distortionless constraint.

Title: Audio Signal Processing Using Time Domain Mel-Frequency Wavelet Coefficient
Authors: Rinku Sebastian, Simon O'Keefe, Martin Trefzer
Abstract: Extracting features from the speech is the most critical process in speech signal processing. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are the most widely used features in the majority of the speaker and speech recognition applications, as the filtering in this feature is similar to the filtering taking place in the human ear. But the main drawback of this feature is that it provides only the frequency information of the signal but does not provide the information about at what time which frequency is present. The wavelet transform, with its flexible time-frequency window, provides time and frequency information of the signal and is an appropriate tool for the analysis of non-stationary signals like speech. On the other hand, because of its uniform frequency scaling, a typical wavelet transform may be less effective in analysing speech signals, have poorer frequency resolution in low frequencies, and be less in line with human auditory perception. Hence, it is necessary to develop a feature that incorporates the merits of both MFCC and wavelet transform. A great deal of studies are trying to combine both these features. The present Wavelet Transform based Mel-scaled feature extraction methods require more computation when a wavelet transform is applied on top of Mel-scale filtering, since it adds extra processing steps. Here we are proposing a method to extract Mel scale features in time domain combining the concept of wavelet transform, thus reducing the computational burden of time-frequency conversion and the complexity of wavelet extraction. Combining our proposed Time domain Mel frequency Wavelet Coefficient(TMFWC) technique with the reservoir computing methodology has significantly improved the efficiency of audio signal processing.

Title: Semi-supervised and unsupervised learning for health indicator extraction from guided waves in aerospace composite structures
Authors: James Josep Perry, Pablo Garcia-Conde Ortiz, George Konstantinou, Cornelie Vergouwen, Edlyn Santha Kumaran, Morteza Moradi
Abstract: Health indicators (HIs) are central to diagnosing and prognosing the condition of aerospace composite structures, enabling efficient maintenance and operational safety. However, extracting reliable HIs remains challenging due to variability in material properties, stochastic damage evolution, and diverse damage modes. Manufacturing defects (e.g., disbonds) and in-service incidents (e.g., bird strikes) further complicate this process. This study presents a comprehensive data-driven framework that learns HIs via two learning approaches integrated with multi-domain signal processing. Because ground-truth HIs are unavailable, a semi-supervised and an unsupervised approach are proposed: (i) a diversity deep semi-supervised anomaly detection (Diversity-DeepSAD) approach augmented with continuous auxiliary labels used as hypothetical damage proxies, which overcomes the limitation of prior binary labels that only distinguish healthy and failed states while neglecting intermediate degradation, and (ii) a degradation-trend-constrained variational autoencoder (DTC-VAE), in which the monotonicity criterion is embedded via an explicit trend constraint. Guided waves with multiple excitation frequencies are used to monitor single-stiffener composite structures under fatigue loading. Time, frequency, and time-frequency representations are explored, and per-frequency HIs are fused via unsupervised ensemble learning to mitigate frequency dependence and reduce variance. Using fast Fourier transform features, the augmented Diversity-DeepSAD model achieved 81.6% performance, while DTC-VAE delivered the most consistent HIs with 92.3% performance, outperforming existing baselines.

Title: Learning to Drive Safely with Hybrid Options
Authors: Bram De Cooman, Johan Suykens
Abstract: Out of the many deep reinforcement learning approaches for autonomous driving, only few make use of the options (or skills) framework. That is surprising, as this framework is naturally suited for hierarchical control applications in general, and autonomous driving tasks in specific. Therefore, in this work the options framework is applied and tailored to autonomous driving tasks on highways. More specifically, we define dedicated options for longitudinal and lateral manoeuvres with embedded safety and comfort constraints. This way, prior domain knowledge can be incorporated into the learning process and the learned driving behaviour can be constrained more easily. We propose several setups for hierarchical control with options and derive practical algorithms following state-of-the-art reinforcement learning techniques. By separately selecting actions for longitudinal and lateral control, the introduced policies over combined and hybrid options obtain the same expressiveness and flexibility that human drivers have, while being easier to interpret than classical policies over continuous actions. Of all the investigated approaches, these flexible policies over hybrid options perform the best under varying traffic conditions, outperforming the baseline policies over actions.

Title: Feature Matching-Based Gait Phase Prediction for Obstacle Crossing Control of Powered Transfemoral Prosthesis
Authors: Jiaxuan Zhang, Yuquan Leng, Yixuan Guo, Chenglong Fu
Abstract: For amputees with powered transfemoral prosthetics, navigating obstacles or complex terrain remains challenging. This study addresses this issue by using an inertial sensor on the sound ankle to guide obstacle-crossing movements. A genetic algorithm computes the optimal neural network structure to predict the required angles of the thigh and knee joints. A gait progression prediction algorithm determines the actuation angle index for the prosthetic knee motor, ultimately defining the necessary thigh and knee angles and gait progression. Results show that when the standard deviation of Gaussian noise added to the thigh angle data is less than 1, the method can effectively eliminate noise interference, achieving 100\% accuracy in gait phase estimation under 150 Hz, with thigh angle prediction error being 8.71\% and knee angle prediction error being 6.78\%. These findings demonstrate the method's ability to accurately predict gait progression and joint angles, offering significant practical value for obstacle negotiation in powered transfemoral prosthetics.

Title: STAR-Bench: Probing Deep Spatio-Temporal Reasoning as Audio 4D Intelligence
Authors: Zihan Liu, Zhikang Niu, Qiuyang Xiao, Zhisheng Zheng, Ruoqi Yuan, Yuhang Zang, Yuhang Cao, Xiaoyi Dong, Jianze Liang, Xie Chen, Leilei Sun, Dahua Lin, Jiaqi Wang
Abstract: Despite rapid progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models and Large Audio-Language Models, existing audio benchmarks largely test semantics that can be recovered from text captions, masking deficits in fine-grained perceptual reasoning. We formalize audio 4D intelligence that is defined as reasoning over sound dynamics in time and 3D space, and introduce STAR-Bench to measure it. STAR-Bench combines a Foundational Acoustic Perception setting (six attributes under absolute and relative regimes) with a Holistic Spatio-Temporal Reasoning setting that includes segment reordering for continuous and discrete processes and spatial tasks spanning static localization, multi-source relations, and dynamic trajectories. Our data curation pipeline uses two methods to ensure high-quality samples. For foundational tasks, we use procedurally synthesized and physics-simulated audio. For holistic data, we follow a four-stage process that includes human annotation and final selection based on human performance. Unlike prior benchmarks where caption-only answering reduces accuracy slightly, STAR-Bench induces far larger drops (-31.5\% temporal, -35.2\% spatial), evidencing its focus on linguistically hard-to-describe cues. Evaluating 19 models reveals substantial gaps compared with humans and a capability hierarchy: closed-source models are bottlenecked by fine-grained perception, while open-source models lag across perception, knowledge, and reasoning. Our STAR-Bench provides critical insights and a clear path forward for developing future models with a more robust understanding of the physical world.

Title: Carbon-Aware Computing for Data Centers with Probabilistic Performance Guarantees
Authors: Sophie Hall, Francesco Micheli, Giuseppe Belgioioso, Ana Radovanović, Florian Dörfler
Abstract: Data centers are significant contributors to carbon emissions and can strain power systems due to their high electricity consumption. To mitigate this impact and to participate in demand response programs, cloud computing companies strive to balance and optimize operations across their global fleets by making strategic decisions about when and where to place compute jobs for execution. In this paper, we introduce a load shaping scheme which reacts to time-varying grid signals by leveraging both temporal and spatial flexibility of compute jobs to provide risk-aware management guidelines and job placement with provable performance guarantees based on distributionally robust optimization. Our approach divides the problem into two key components: (i) day-ahead planning, which generates an optimal scheduling strategy based on historical load data, and (ii) real-time job placement and (time) scheduling, which dynamically tracks the optimal strategy generated in (i). We validate our method in simulation using normalized load profiles from randomly selected Google clusters, incorporating time-varying grid signals. We can demonstrate significant reductions in carbon cost and peak power with our approach compared to myopic greedy policies, while maintaining computational efficiency and abiding to system and grid constraints.

Title: Dynamic Dimensioning of Frequency Containment Reserves: The Case of the Nordic Grid
Authors: Jöbke Janssen, Alessandro Zocca, Bert Zwart, Jalal Kazempour
Abstract: One of the main responsibilities of a Transmission System Operator (TSO) operating an electric grid is to maintain a designated frequency (e.g., 50 Hz in Europe). To achieve this, TSOs have created several products called frequency-supporting ancillary services. The Frequency Containment Reserve (FCR) is one of these ancillary service products. This article focuses on the TSO problem of determining the volume procured for FCR. Specifically, we investigate the potential benefits and impact on grid security when transitioning from a traditionally \textit{static} procurement method to a \textit{dynamic} strategy for FCR volume. We take the Nordic synchronous area in Europe as a case study and use a diffusion model to capture its frequency development. We introduce a controlled mean reversal parameter to assess changes in FCR obligations, in particular for the Nordic FCR-N ancillary service product. We establish closed-form expressions for exceedance probabilities and use historical frequency data as input to calibrate the model. We show that a dynamic dimensioning approach for FCR has the potential to significantly reduce the exceedance probabilities (up to $37\%$) while maintaining the total yearly procured FCR volume equal to that of the current static approach. Alternatively, a dynamic dimensioning approach could significantly increase security at limited extra cost.

Title: A Volumetric Privacy Measure for Dynamical Systems With Bounded Disturbance
Authors: Chuanghong Weng, Ehsan Nekouei
Abstract: In this paper, we first present a volumetric privacy measure for dynamical systems with bounded disturbances, wherein the states of the system contain private information and an adversary with access to sensor measurements attempts to infer the set of potential values of the private information. Under the proposed privacy measure, the volume of the uncertainty set of the adversary given the sensor measurements is considered as the privacy level of the system. We next characteristic the time evolution of the proposed privacy measure and study its properties for a particular system with both public and private states, where a set containing the public state is shared as the observation. Approximate set-membership estimation techniques are developed to compute the private-state uncertainty set, and the properties of the privacy measure are analyzed, demonstrating that the uncertainty reduction of the adversary is bounded by the information gain from the observation set. Furthermore, an optimization-based privacy filter design problem is formulated, employing randomization and linear programming to enhance the privacy level. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through a production-inventory case study. Results show that the optimal privacy filter significantly improves robustness against inference attacks and outperforms two baseline mechanisms based on additive noise and quantization.

Title: Detecting Neurocognitive Disorders through Analyses of Topic Evolution and Cross-modal Consistency in Visual-Stimulated Narratives
Authors: Jinchao Li, Yuejiao Wang, Junan Li, Jiawen Kang, Bo Zheng, Ka Ho Wong, Brian Mak, Helene H. Fung, Jean Woo, Man-Wai Mak, Timothy Kwok, Vincent Mok, Xianmin Gong, Xixin Wu, Xunying Liu, Patrick C. M. Wong, Helen Meng
Abstract: Early detection of neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) is crucial for timely intervention and disease management. Given that language impairments manifest early in NCD progression, visual-stimulated narrative (VSN)-based analysis offers a promising avenue for NCD detection. Current VSN-based NCD detection methods primarily focus on linguistic microstructures (e.g., lexical diversity) that are closely tied to bottom-up, stimulus-driven cognitive processes. While these features illuminate basic language abilities, the higher-order linguistic macrostructures (e.g., topic development) that may reflect top-down, concept-driven cognitive abilities remain underexplored. These macrostructural patterns are crucial for NCD detection, yet challenging to quantify due to their abstract and complex nature. To bridge this gap, we propose two novel macrostructural approaches: (1) a Dynamic Topic Model (DTM) to track topic evolution over time, and (2) a Text-Image Temporal Alignment Network (TITAN) to measure cross-modal consistency between narrative and visual stimuli. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in NCD detection, with TITAN achieving superior performance across three corpora: ADReSS (F1=0.8889), ADReSSo (F1=0.8504), and CU-MARVEL-RABBIT (F1=0.7238). Feature contribution analysis reveals that macrostructural features (e.g., topic variability, topic change rate, and topic consistency) constitute the most significant contributors to the model's decision pathways, outperforming the investigated microstructural features. These findings underscore the value of macrostructural analysis for understanding linguistic-cognitive interactions associated with NCDs.

Title: Acoustic Neural 3D Reconstruction Under Pose Drift
Authors: Tianxiang Lin, Mohamad Qadri, Kevin Zhang, Adithya Pediredla, Christopher A. Metzler, Michael Kaess
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing neural implicit surfaces for 3D reconstruction using acoustic images collected with drifting sensor poses. The accuracy of current state-of-the-art 3D acoustic modeling algorithms is highly dependent on accurate pose estimation; small errors in sensor pose can lead to severe reconstruction artifacts. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that jointly optimizes the neural scene representation and sonar poses. Our algorithm does so by parameterizing the 6DoF poses as learnable parameters and backpropagating gradients through the neural renderer and implicit representation. We validated our algorithm on both real and simulated datasets. It produces high-fidelity 3D reconstructions even under significant pose drift.

Title: The Limits of Fairness of the Variational Generalized Nash Equilibrium
Authors: Sophie Hall, Florian Dörfler, Heinrich H. Nax, Saverio Bolognani
Abstract: Generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) problems are commonly used to model strategic interactions between self-interested agents who are coupled in cost and constraints. Specifically, the variational GNE, a refinement of the GNE, is often selected as the solution concept due to its non-discriminatory treatment of agents by charging a uniform ``shadow price" for shared resources. We study the fairness concept of v-GNEs from a comparability perspective and show that it makes an implicit assumption of unit comparability of agent's cost functions, one of the strongest comparability notions. Further, we introduce a new solution concept, f-GNE in which a fairness metric is chosen a priori which is compatible with the comparability at hand. We introduce an electric vehicle charging game to demonstrate the fragility of v-GNE fairness and compare it to the f-GNE under various fairness metrics.

Title: Physics-Aware Initialization Refinement in Code-Aided EM for Blind Channel Estimation
Authors: Chin-Hung Chen, Ivana Nikoloska, Wim van Houtum, Yan Wu, Alex Alvarado
Abstract: This paper addresses the well-known local maximum problem of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm in blind intersymbol interference (ISI) channel estimation. This problem primarily results from phase and shift ambiguity during initialization, which blind estimation is inherently unable to distinguish. We propose an effective initialization refinement algorithm that utilizes the decoder output as a model selection metric, incorporating a technique to detect phase and shift ambiguity. Our results show that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the number of local maximum cases to nearly one-third for a 3-tap ISI channel under highly uncertain initial conditions. The improvement becomes more pronounced as initial errors increase and the channel memory grows. When used in a turbo equalizer, the proposed algorithm is required only in the first turbo iteration, which limits any complexity increase with subsequent iterations.

Title: Servo navigation and phase equalization enhanced by run-time stabilization (PEERS) for 3D EPI time series
Authors: Malte Riedel, Thomas Ulrich, Samuel Bianchi, Klaas P. Pruessmann
Abstract: Purpose: To enhance time-resolved segmented imaging by synergy of run-time stabilization and retrospective, data-driven phase correction. Methods: A segmented 3D EPI sequence for fMRI time series is equipped with servo navigation based on short orbital navigators and a linear perturbation model, enabling run-time correction for rigid-body motion as well as bulk phase and frequency fluctuation. Complementary retrospective phase correction is based on the repetitive structure of the time series and serves to address residual phase and frequency offsets. The combined approach is termed phase equalization enhanced by run-time stabilization (PEERS). Results: The proposed strategy is evaluated in a phantom and in-vivo. Servo navigation is found to diminish motion confound in raw data and maintain k-space consistency over time series. In turn, retrospective phase equalization is found to eliminate shot-wise phase and frequency offsets relative to the navigator, which are attributed to eddy-currents and vibrations from phase encoding. Retrospective phase equalization reduces the precision requirements for run-time frequency control, supporting the use of short navigators. Relative to conventional volume realignment, PEERS achieved tSNR improvements up to $30\%$ for small motion and in the order of $10\%$ when volunteers tried to hold still. Retrospective phase equalization is found to clearly outperform phase correction based solely on navigator-based frequency estimates. Conclusion: Servo navigation achieves high-precision run-time motion correction for 3D EPI fMRI. Coarse frequency tracking based on short navigators is supplemented by precise retrospective frequency and phase correction. Fully automatic and self-calibrated, PEERS offers effective plug-and-play motion and phase correction for 3D fMRI.

Title: A Direct Comparison of Simultaneously Recorded Scalp, Around-Ear, and In-Ear EEG for Neural Selective Auditory Attention Decoding to Speech
Authors: Simon Geirnaert, Simon L. Kappel, Preben Kidmose
Abstract: Current assistive hearing devices, such as hearing aids and cochlear implants, lack the ability to adapt to the listener's focus of auditory attention, limiting their effectiveness in complex acoustic environments like cocktail party scenarios where multiple conversations occur simultaneously. Neuro-steered hearing devices aim to overcome this limitation by decoding the listener's auditory attention from neural signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG). While many auditory attention decoding (AAD) studies have used high-density scalp EEG, such systems are impractical for daily use as they are bulky and uncomfortable. Therefore, AAD with wearable and unobtrusive EEG systems that are comfortable to wear and can be used for long-term recording are required. Around-ear EEG systems like cEEGrids have shown promise in AAD, but in-ear EEG, recorded via custom earpieces offering superior comfort, remains underexplored. We present a new AAD dataset with simultaneously recorded scalp, around-ear, and in-ear EEG, enabling a direct comparison. Using a classic linear stimulus reconstruction algorithm, a significant performance gap between all three systems exists, with AAD accuracies of 83.4% (scalp), 67.2% (around-ear), and 61.1% (in-ear) on 60s decision windows. These results highlight the trade-off between decoding performance and practical usability. Yet, while the ear-based systems using basic algorithms might currently not yield accurate enough performances for a decision speed-sensitive application in hearing aids, their significant performance suggests potential for attention monitoring on longer timescales. Furthermore, adding an external reference or a few scalp electrodes via greedy forward selection substantially and quickly boosts accuracy by over 10 percent point, especially for in-ear EEG. These findings position in-ear EEG as a promising component in EEG sensor networks for AAD.

Title: Acoustic and Machine Learning Methods for Speech-Based Suicide Risk Assessment: A Systematic Review
Authors: Ambre Marie, Marine Garnier, Thomas Bertin, Laura Machart, Guillaume Dardenne, Gwenolé Quellec, Sofian Berrouiguet
Abstract: Suicide remains a public health challenge, necessitating improved detection methods to facilitate timely intervention and treatment. This systematic review evaluates the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in assessing suicide risk through acoustic analysis of speech. Following PRISMA guidelines, we analyzed 33 articles selected from PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. The last search was conducted in February 2025. Risk of bias was assessed using the PROBAST tool. Studies analyzing acoustic features between individuals at risk of suicide (RS) and those not at risk (NRS) were included, while studies lacking acoustic data, a suicide-related focus, or sufficient methodological details were excluded. Sample sizes varied widely and were reported in terms of participants or speech segments, depending on the study. Results were synthesized narratively based on acoustic features and classifier performance. Findings consistently showed significant acoustic feature variations between RS and NRS populations, particularly involving jitter, fundamental frequency (F0), Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), and power spectral density (PSD). Classifier performance varied based on algorithms, modalities, and speech elicitation methods, with multimodal approaches integrating acoustic, linguistic, and metadata features demonstrating superior performance. Among the 29 classifier-based studies, reported AUC values ranged from 0.62 to 0.985 and accuracies from 60% to 99.85%. Most datasets were imbalanced in favor of NRS, and performance metrics were rarely reported separately by group, limiting clear identification of direction of effect.

Title: Assessment of Power System Stability Considering Multiple Time-Scale Dynamics: Insights into Hopf Bifurcations in Presence of GFL and GFM IBRs
Authors: Luis David Pabon Ospina, Martin Braun, Sushobhan Chatterjee, Sijia Geng
Abstract: Real power systems exhibit dynamics that evolve across a wide range of time scales, from very fast to very slow phenomena. Historically, incorporating these wide-ranging dynamics into a single model has been impractical. As a result, power engineers rely on time-scale decomposition to simplify models. When fast phenomena are evaluated, slow dynamics are neglected (assumed stable), and vice versa. This paper challenges this paradigm by showing the importance of assessing power system stability while considering multiple time scales simultaneously. Using the concept of Hopf bifurcations, it exemplifies instability issues that would be missed if multi-time-scale dynamics are not considered. Although this work employs both grid-following and grid-forming inverter-based resource models, it is not a direct comparison. Instead, it presents a case study demonstrating how one technology can complement the other from a multi time-scale dynamics perspective.

Title: Flight-Ready Precise and Robust Carrier-Phase GNSS Navigation Software for Distributed Space Systems
Authors: Samuel Y. W. Low, Toby Bell, Simone D'Amico
Abstract: This paper presents the full requirements analysis, design, development, and testing of high-precision navigation flight software for Distributed Space Systems (DSS) using Carrier Phase Differential GNSS (CDGNSS). Five main contributions are made. First, a survey of flown and upcoming DSS missions with stringent precision requirements is conducted, from which a thorough requirements analysis is distilled to guide development and testing. Second, a real-time navigation functional architecture is designed, and adopts a sparse and regularized Consider Kalman Filter with options for numerical stability in-flight. The filter rigorously accounts for uncertainties in process noise, measurement noise, and biases. It tracks float ambiguities with integer resolution where possible. The covariance correlation structure is preserved under all navigation modes, including contingencies and outages. Third, a lightweight, memoryless Fault Detection, Isolation, and Recovery (FDIR) module is developed to guard against anomalous measurements, providing statistical screening and ensuring robust navigation. Fourth, the software architecture is proposed for ease of integration, with strategies presented for modularity and computational efficiency tailored to constrained flight systems. Fifth, a comprehensive test campaign is conducted, mapped to a requirements verification matrix, spanning unit, interface, software-in-the-loop, and real-time hardware-in-the-loop tests, emphasizing gradual test fidelity for efficient fault isolation. Finally, flight-like results are demonstrated using the VISORS mission, due to the generalizability of the VISORS navigation operations, and the stringency which demands sub-centimeter relative position and sub-millimeter-per-second velocity accuracy. This architecture aims to serve as a reference for next-generation DSS missions adopting CDGNSS.

Title: Local Density-Based Anomaly Score Normalization for Domain Generalization
Authors: Kevin Wilkinghoff, Haici Yang, Janek Ebbers, François G. Germain, Gordon Wichern, Jonathan Le Roux
Abstract: State-of-the-art anomalous sound detection (ASD) systems in domain-shifted conditions rely on projecting audio signals into an embedding space and using distance-based outlier detection to compute anomaly scores. One of the major difficulties to overcome is the so-called domain mismatch between the anomaly score distributions of a source domain and a target domain that differ acoustically and in terms of the amount of training data provided. A decision threshold that is optimal for one domain may be highly sub-optimal for the other domain and vice versa. This significantly degrades the performance when only using a single decision threshold, as is required when generalizing to multiple data domains that are possibly unseen during training while still using the same trained ASD system as in the source domain. To reduce this mismatch between the domains, we propose a simple local-density-based anomaly score normalization scheme. In experiments conducted on several ASD datasets, we show that the proposed normalization scheme consistently improves performance for various types of embedding-based ASD systems and yields better results than existing anomaly score normalization approaches.

Title: Design and Optimization of EV Charging Infrastructure with Battery in Commercial Buildings
Authors: Quan Nguyen, Christine Holland, Siddharth Sridhar
Abstract: The installation of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in buildings is inevitable, as states push for increased EV adoption to support decarbonization efforts. This transition could force the need for grid infrastructure upgrades and enhanced controls to support reliable power delivery to end-use loads, and overall economic operation. This paper evaluates strategies that address these needs on two fronts: i) optimal sizing of service transformers and battery energy storage systems (BESS), and ii) optimized coordination between EV charging, BESS operation, and building demand. These strategies are applied to a school campus setting, consisting of building and EV charging loads, to provide an illustration of energy management in commercial buildings with EV fleets. A rolling-window optimization approach is applied to determine i) optimal sizing of the service transformer and BESS and ii) optimal control of EV charging and BESS charge/discharge schedules. The design and control strategies are validated in a 20-year time horizon with an annually increasing number of EVs (buses and vans). In addition, an economic analysis is also carried out to show the costs and benefits of each design as a medium- and long-term investment.

Title: Passive Microwave Tag Classification Using RF Fingerprinting and Machine Learning
Authors: Cory Hilton, Mohammad Rashid, Faiz Sherman, Steven Bush, Jeffrey A. Nanzer
Abstract: We present an approach to identifying wireless microwave tags using radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting and machine learning. The tags are designed for low cost and simplicity, consisting of only two antennas and a single nonlinear element (a diode). An interrogating transceiver transmits a signal consisting of a set of individual frequency tones that is captured by the tag. The signal response of the diode is nonlinear, and can be represented by an infinite power series, the coefficients of which are similar but not identical for different physical diodes due to small manufacturing perturbations. The small differences in the signal responses manifest in the spectral signal response of the tag, which is retransmitted back to the interrogating transceiver. Input into machine learning algorithms, the slight differences in the spectral responses of the diodes can be used to uniquely identify devices. To demonstrate the concept, we designed 2.0 GHz tags consisting of patch antennas and a single diode, along with a bi-static radar system operating at the 2.0 GHz 802.11 Wi-Fi band transmitting multi-tone continuous wave signals representing common 802.11 training fields. The received signals were processed using a set of algorithms for comparison purposes. A real-time classification accuracy of 95% between two tags was achieved.

Title: RIR-Mega: a large-scale simulated room impulse response dataset for machine learning and room acoustics modeling
Authors: Mandip Goswami
Abstract: Room impulse responses are a core resource for dereverberation, robust speech recognition, source localization, and room acoustics estimation. We present RIR-Mega, a large collection of simulated RIRs described by a compact, machine friendly metadata schema and distributed with simple tools for validation and reuse. The dataset ships with a Hugging Face Datasets loader, scripts for metadata checks and checksums, and a reference regression baseline that predicts RT60 like targets from waveforms. On a train and validation split of 36,000 and 4,000 examples, a small Random Forest on lightweight time and spectral features reaches a mean absolute error near 0.013 s and a root mean square error near 0.022 s. We host a subset with 1,000 linear array RIRs and 3,000 circular array RIRs on Hugging Face for streaming and quick tests, and preserve the complete 50,000 RIR archive on Zenodo. The dataset and code are public to support reproducible studies.

Title: A Unified Framework for Direction and Diffuseness Estimation Using Tight-Frame Microphone Arrays
Authors: Akira Omoto
Abstract: This work presents a unified framework for estimating both sound-field direction and diffuseness using practical microphone arrays with different spatial configurations. Building on covariance-based diffuseness models, we formulate a velocity-only covariance approach that enables consistent diffuseness evaluation across heterogeneous array geometries without requiring mode whitening or spherical-harmonic decomposition. Three array types -- an A-format array, a rigid-sphere array, and a newly proposed tight-frame array -- are modeled and compared through both simulations and measurement-based experiments. The results show that the tight-frame configuration achieves near-isotropic directional sampling and reproduces diffuseness characteristics comparable to those of higher-order spherical arrays, while maintaining a compact physical structure. We further examine the accuracy of direction-of-arrival estimation based on acoustic intensity within the same framework. These findings connect theoretical diffuseness analysis with implementable array designs and support the development of robust, broadband methods for spatial-sound-field characterization.

Title: TraceTrans: Translation and Spatial Tracing for Surgical Prediction
Authors: Xiyu Luo, Haodong Li, Xinxing Cheng, He Zhao, Yang Hu, Xuan Song, Tianyang Zhang
Abstract: Image-to-image translation models have achieved notable success in converting images across visual domains and are increasingly used for medical tasks such as predicting post-operative outcomes and modeling disease progression. However, most existing methods primarily aim to match the target distribution and often neglect spatial correspondences between the source and translated images. This limitation can lead to structural inconsistencies and hallucinations, undermining the reliability and interpretability of the predictions. These challenges are accentuated in clinical applications by the stringent requirement for anatomical accuracy. In this work, we present TraceTrans, a novel deformable image translation model designed for post-operative prediction that generates images aligned with the target distribution while explicitly revealing spatial correspondences with the pre-operative input. The framework employs an encoder for feature extraction and dual decoders for predicting spatial deformations and synthesizing the translated image. The predicted deformation field imposes spatial constraints on the generated output, ensuring anatomical consistency with the source. Extensive experiments on medical cosmetology and brain MRI datasets demonstrate that TraceTrans delivers accurate and interpretable post-operative predictions, highlighting its potential for reliable clinical deployment.

Title: RMD: Robust Modal Decomposition with Constrained Bandwidth
Authors: Wang Hao, Kuang Zhang, Hou Chengyu, Yang Yifan, Tan Chenxing, Fu Weifeng
Abstract: Modal decomposition techniques, such as Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), and Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA), have advanced time-frequency signal analysis since the early 21st century. These methods are generally classified into two categories: numerical optimization-based methods (EMD, VMD) and spectral decomposition methods (SSA) that consider the physical meaning of signals. The former can produce spurious modes due to the lack of physical constraints, while the latter is more sensitive to noise and struggles with nonlinear signals. Despite continuous improvements in these methods, a modal decomposition approach that effectively combines the strengths of both categories remains elusive. Thus, this paper proposes a Robust Modal Decomposition (RMD) method with constrained bandwidth, which preserves the intrinsic structure of the signal by mapping the time series into its trajectory-GRAM matrix in phase space. Moreover, the method incorporates bandwidth constraints during the decomposition process, enhancing noise resistance. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate its performance: on the synthetic dataset front, we focused on low-SNR sine wave separation tasks and nonlinear signal processing experiments to verify the ability of RMD to extract weak signals and handle nonlinear distortions; on real-world data, we tested it on a real-collected millimeter-wave micro-motion energy dataset to demonstrate its practical applicability in radar-related micro-motion signature analysis.

Title: NeuroDOB: A Deep Neural Observer-Based Controller for Vehicle Lateral Dynamics
Authors: Sangmin Kim, Taehun Kim, Guntae Kim, Chang Mook Kang
Abstract: This paper proposes NeuroDOB, a deep neural network based observer controller for vehicle lateral dynamics, which replaces the conventional disturbance observer (DOB) with a deep neural network (DNN) to enhance personalized lateral control. Unlike conventional DOBs that compensate for general disturbances such as road friction variation and crosswind, NeuroDOB explicitly addresses unmodeled vehicle dynamics and driver-specific behaviors by learning the steering compensation signal from driver-in-the-loop simulations using CarSim's embedded controller as a surrogate driver. The proposed architecture integrates NeuroDOB with a linear quadratic regulator (LQR), where the DNN outputs a delta error correction added to the baseline LQR steering input to produce the final control command. Input features to the DNN include lateral position and yaw angle errors, and the LQR control input. Experimental validation using a lateral dynamic bicycle model within CarSim demonstrates that NeuroDOB effectively adapts to individual driving habits, improving lateral control performance beyond what conventional LQR controllers achieve. The results indicate the potential of deep neural network based observer to enable personalized and adaptive autonomous vehicle control. In cognitive terms, the proposed architecture can be viewed as a dual-system control structure. The baseline LQR corresponds to System 1, a model-based, fast, and analytic reasoning layer ensuring stability. The NeuroDOB acts as System 2, a reflective, data-driven layer that learns compensation from experience and corrects the analytical bias of System 1. Together, they form an integrated decision process analogous to human intuition-reflection interaction, enabling both stability and adaptability in lateral control.

Title: SoulX-Podcast: Towards Realistic Long-form Podcasts with Dialectal and Paralinguistic Diversity
Authors: Hanke Xie, Haopeng Lin, Wenxiao Cao, Dake Guo, Wenjie Tian, Jun Wu, Hanlin Wen, Ruixuan Shang, Hongmei Liu, Zhiqi Jiang, Yuepeng Jiang, Wenxi Chen, Ruiqi Yan, Jiale Qian, Yichao Yan, Shunshun Yin, Ming Tao, Xie Chen, Lei Xie, Xinsheng Wang
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis have significantly improved speech expressiveness and naturalness. However, most existing systems are tailored for single-speaker synthesis and fall short in generating coherent multi-speaker conversational speech. This technical report presents SoulX-Podcast, a system designed for podcast-style multi-turn, multi-speaker dialogic speech generation, while also achieving state-of-the-art performance in conventional TTS tasks. To meet the higher naturalness demands of multi-turn spoken dialogue, SoulX-Podcast integrates a range of paralinguistic controls and supports both Mandarin and English, as well as several Chinese dialects, including Sichuanese, Henanese, and Cantonese, enabling more personalized podcast-style speech generation. Experimental results demonstrate that SoulX-Podcast can continuously produce over 90 minutes of conversation with stable speaker timbre and smooth speaker transitions. Moreover, speakers exhibit contextually adaptive prosody, reflecting natural rhythm and intonation changes as dialogues progress. Across multiple evaluation metrics, SoulX-Podcast achieves state-of-the-art performance in both monologue TTS and multi-turn conversational speech synthesis.

Title: A cutting-surface consensus approach for distributed robust optimization of multi-agent systems
Authors: Jun Fu, Xunhao Wu
Abstract: A novel and fully distributed optimization method is proposed for the distributed robust convex program (DRCP) over a time-varying unbalanced directed network under the uniformly jointly strongly connected (UJSC) assumption. Firstly, an approximated DRCP (ADRCP) is introduced by discretizing the semi-infinite constraints into a finite number of inequality constraints to ensure tractability and restricting the right-hand side of the constraints with a positive parameter to ensure a feasible solution for (DRCP) can be obtained. This problem is iteratively solved by a distributed projected gradient algorithm proposed in this paper, which is based on epigraphic reformulation and gradient projected operations. Secondly, a cutting-surface consensus approach is proposed for locating an approximately optimal consensus solution of the DRCP with guaranteed local feasibility for each agent. This approach is based on iteratively approximating the DRCP by successively reducing the restriction parameter of the right-hand constraints and adding the cutting-surfaces into the existing finite set of constraints. Thirdly, to ensure finite-time termination of the distributed optimization, a distributed termination algorithm is developed based on consensus and zeroth-order stopping conditions under UJSC graphs. Fourthly, it is proved that the cutting-surface consensus approach terminates finitely and yields a feasible and approximate optimal solution for each agent. Finally, the effectiveness of the approach is illustrated through a numerical example.

Title: UniCrossFi: A Unified Framework For Cross-Domain Wi-Fi-based Gesture Recognition
Authors: Ke Xu, Zhiyong Zheng, Hongyuan Zhu, Lei Wang, Jiangtao Wang
Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing systems are severely hindered by cross domain problem when deployed in unseen real-world environments. Existing methods typically design separate frameworks for either domain adaptation or domain generalization, often relying on extensive labeled data. Existing methods that designed for domain generalization is often relying on extensive labeled data. However, real-world scenarios are far more complex, where the deployed model must be capable of handling generalization under limited labeled source data. To this end, we propose UniCrossFi, a unified framework designed to mitigate performance drop in CSI-based sensing across diverse deployment settings. Our framework not only extends conventional Domain Generalization (DG) to a more practical Semi-Supervised Domain Generalization (SSDG) setting, where only partially labeled source data are available, but also introduces a physics-informed data augmentation strategy, Antenna Response Consistency (ARC). ARC mitigates the risk of learning superficial shortcuts by exploiting the intrinsic spatial diversity of multi-antenna systems, treating signals from different antennas as naturally augmented views of the same event. In addition, we design a Unified Contrastive Objective to prevent conventional contrastive learning from pushing apart samples from different domains that share the same class. We conduct extensive experiments on the public Widar and CSIDA datasets. The results demonstrate that UniCrossFi consistently establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods across all unsupervised domain adaptation, DG, and SSDG benchmarks. UniCrossFi provides a principled and practical solution to the domain shift challenge, advancing the feasibility of robust, real-world Wi-Fi sensing systems that can operate effectively with limited labeled data.

Title: Rejection-Sampled Universal Quantization for Smaller Quantization Errors
Authors: Chih Wei Ling, Cheuk Ting Li
Abstract: We construct a randomized vector quantizer which has a smaller maximum error compared to all known lattice quantizers with the same entropy for dimensions 5, 6, ..., 48, and also has a smaller mean squared error compared to known lattice quantizers with the same entropy for dimensions 35, ..., 47, in the high resolution limit. Moreover, our randomized quantizer has a desirable property that the quantization error is always uniform over the ball and independent of the input. Our construction is based on applying rejection sampling on universal quantization, which allows us to shape the error distribution to be any continuous distribution, not only uniform distributions over basic cells of a lattice as in conventional dithered quantization. We also characterize the high SNR limit of one-shot channel simulation for any additive noise channel under a mild assumption (e.g., the AWGN channel), up to an additive constant of 1.45 bits.

Title: RapVerse: Coherent Vocals and Whole-Body Motions Generations from Text
Authors: Jiaben Chen, Xin Yan, Yihang Chen, Siyuan Cen, Zixin Wang, Qinwei Ma, Haoyu Zhen, Kaizhi Qian, Lie Lu, Chuang Gan
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a challenging task for simultaneously generating 3D holistic body motions and singing vocals directly from textual lyrics inputs, advancing beyond existing works that typically address these two modalities in isolation. To facilitate this, we first collect the RapVerse dataset, a large dataset containing synchronous rapping vocals, lyrics, and high-quality 3D holistic body meshes. With the RapVerse dataset, we investigate the extent to which scaling autoregressive multimodal transformers across language, audio, and motion can enhance the coherent and realistic generation of vocals and whole-body human motions. For modality unification, a vector-quantized variational autoencoder is employed to encode whole-body motion sequences into discrete motion tokens, while a vocal-to-unit model is leveraged to obtain quantized audio tokens preserving content, prosodic information and singer identity. By jointly performing transformer modeling on these three modalities in a unified way, our framework ensures a seamless and realistic blend of vocals and human motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our unified generation framework not only produces coherent and realistic singing vocals alongside human motions directly from textual inputs, but also rivals the performance of specialized single-modality generation systems, establishing new benchmarks for joint vocal-motion generation.

Title: Adaptive Anomaly Detection in Network Flows with Low-Rank Tensor Decompositions and Deep Unrolling
Authors: Lukas Schynol, Marius Pesavento
Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is increasingly recognized as a key component for ensuring the resilience of future communication systems. While deep learning has shown state-of-the-art AD performance, its application in critical systems is hindered by concerns regarding training data efficiency, domain adaptation and interpretability. This work considers AD in network flows using incomplete measurements, leveraging a robust tensor decomposition approach and deep unrolling techniques to address these challenges. We first propose a novel block-successive convex approximation algorithm based on a regularized model-fitting objective where the normal flows are modeled as low-rank tensors and anomalies as sparse. An augmentation of the objective is introduced to decrease the computational cost. We apply deep unrolling to derive a novel deep network architecture based on our proposed algorithm, treating the regularization parameters as learnable weights. Inspired by Bayesian approaches, we extend the model architecture to perform online adaptation to per-flow and per-time-step statistics, improving AD performance while maintaining a low parameter count and preserving the problem's permutation equivariances. To optimize the deep network weights for detection performance, we employ a homotopy optimization approach based on an efficient approximation of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our proposed deep network architecture exhibits a high training data efficiency, outperforms reference methods, and adapts seamlessly to varying network topologies.

Title: Two-Stage Learning of Stabilizing Neural Controllers via Zubov Sampling and Iterative Domain Expansion
Authors: Haoyu Li, Xiangru Zhong, Bin Hu, Huan Zhang
Abstract: Learning-based neural network (NN) control policies have shown impressive empirical performance. However, obtaining stability guarantees and estimates of the region of attraction of these learned neural controllers is challenging due to the lack of stable and scalable training and verification algorithms. Although previous works in this area have achieved great success, much conservatism remains in their frameworks. In this work, we propose a novel two-stage training framework to jointly synthesize a controller and a Lyapunov function for continuous-time systems. By leveraging a Zubov-inspired region of attraction characterization to directly estimate stability boundaries, we propose a novel training-data sampling strategy and a domain-updating mechanism that significantly reduces the conservatism in training. Moreover, unlike existing works on continuous-time systems that rely on an SMT solver to formally verify the Lyapunov condition, we extend state-of-the-art neural network verifier $\alpha,\!\beta$-CROWN with the capability of performing automatic bound propagation through the Jacobian of dynamical systems and a novel verification scheme that avoids expensive bisection. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct numerical experiments by synthesizing and verifying controllers on several challenging nonlinear systems across multiple dimensions. We show that our training can yield region of attractions with volume $5 - 1.5\cdot 10^{5}$ times larger compared to the baselines, and our verification on continuous systems can be up to $40-10{,}000$ times faster compared to the traditional SMT solver dReal.

Title: BNMusic: Blending Environmental Noises into Personalized Music
Authors: Chi Zuo, Martin B. Møller, Pablo Martínez-Nuevo, Huayang Huang, Yu Wu, Ye Zhu
Abstract: While being disturbed by environmental noises, the acoustic masking technique is a conventional way to reduce the annoyance in audio engineering that seeks to cover up the noises with other dominant yet less intrusive sounds. However, misalignment between the dominant sound and the noise-such as mismatched downbeats-often requires an excessive volume increase to achieve effective masking. Motivated by recent advances in cross-modal generation, in this work, we introduce an alternative method to acoustic masking, aiming to reduce the noticeability of environmental noises by blending them into personalized music generated based on user-provided text prompts. Following the paradigm of music generation using mel-spectrogram representations, we propose a Blending Noises into Personalized Music (BNMusic) framework with two key stages. The first stage synthesizes a complete piece of music in a mel-spectrogram representation that encapsulates the musical essence of the noise. In the second stage, we adaptively amplify the generated music segment to further reduce noise perception and enhance the blending effectiveness, while preserving auditory quality. Our experiments with comprehensive evaluations on MusicBench, EPIC-SOUNDS, and ESC-50 demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting the ability to blend environmental noise with rhythmically aligned, adaptively amplified, and enjoyable music segments, minimizing the noticeability of the noise, thereby improving overall acoustic experiences.

Title: MathBode: Understanding LLM Reasoning with Dynamical Systems
Authors: Charles L. Wang
Abstract: This paper presents MathBode, a dynamic diagnostic for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Instead of one-shot accuracy, MathBode treats each parametric problem as a system: we drive a single parameter sinusoidally and fit first-harmonic responses of model outputs and exact solutions. This yields interpretable, frequency-resolved metrics -- gain (amplitude tracking) and phase (lag) -- that form Bode-style fingerprints. Across five closed-form families (linear solve, ratio/saturation, compound interest, 2x2 linear systems, similar triangles), the diagnostic surfaces systematic low-pass behavior and growing phase lag that accuracy alone obscures. We compare several models against a symbolic baseline that calibrates the instrument ($G \approx 1$, $\phi \approx 0$). Results separate frontier from mid-tier models on dynamics, providing a compact, reproducible protocol that complements standard benchmarks with actionable measurements of reasoning fidelity and consistency. We open-source the dataset and code to enable further research and adoption.

Title: PEARL: Peer-Enhanced Adaptive Radio via On-Device LLM
Authors: Ju-Hyung Lee, Yanqing Lu, Klaus Doppler
Abstract: We present PEARL (Peer-Enhanced Adaptive Radio via On-Device LLM), a framework for cooperative cross-layer optimization in device-to-device (D2D) communication. Building on our previous work on single-device on-device LLMs, PEARL extends the paradigm by leveraging both publisher and subscriber states to guide Wi-Fi Aware (WA) parameter selection. A context-aware reward, which normalizes latency by application tolerances and modulates energy by device battery states, provides richer supervision for KL-based finetuning. We study two lightweight variants: PEARL (Head + Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)) achieves the best overall performance, while PEARL-Lite (Head-only) delivers sub-20 ms inference at near-identical objective scores. Across synthetic scenarios grounded in real measurements, PEARL improves objective scores over heuristic and compact model baselines and reduces energy by up to 16% in cooperative low-battery cases. These results demonstrate that peer-aware context, reward-aligned training, and head-based efficiency make LLMs practical for always-on, on-device cross-layer control.

Title: Long-Term Mapping of the Douro River Plume with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Nicolò Dal Fabbro, Milad Mesbahi, Renato Mendes, João Borges de Sousa, George J. Pappas
Abstract: We study the problem of long-term (multiple days) mapping of a river plume using multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), focusing on the Douro river representative use-case. We propose an energy - and communication - efficient multi-agent reinforcement learning approach in which a central coordinator intermittently communicates with the AUVs, collecting measurements and issuing commands. Our approach integrates spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression (GPR) with a multi-head Q-network controller that regulates direction and speed for each AUV. Simulations using the Delft3D ocean model demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both single- and multi-agent benchmarks, with scaling the number of agents both improving mean squared error (MSE) and operational endurance. In some instances, our algorithm demonstrates that doubling the number of AUVs can more than double endurance while maintaining or improving accuracy, underscoring the benefits of multi-agent coordination. Our learned policies generalize across unseen seasonal regimes over different months and years, demonstrating promise for future developments of data-driven long-term monitoring of dynamic plume environments.

Title: Learning Wireless Interference Patterns: Decoupled GNN for Throughput Prediction in Heterogeneous Multi-Hop p-CSMA Networks
Authors: Faezeh Dehghan Tarzjani, Bhaskar Krishnamachari
Abstract: The p-persistent CSMA protocol is central to random-access MAC analysis, but predicting saturation throughput in heterogeneous multi-hop wireless networks remains a hard problem. Simplified models that assume a single, shared interference domain can underestimate throughput by 48-62% in sparse topologies. Exact Markov-chain analyses are accurate but scale exponentially in computation time, making them impractical for large networks. These computational barriers motivate structural machine learning approaches like GNNs for scalable throughput prediction in general network topologies. Yet off-the-shelf GNNs struggle here: a standard GCN yields 63.94% normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) on heterogeneous networks because symmetric normalization conflates a node's direct interference with higher-order, cascading effects that pertain to how interference propagates over the network graph. Building on these insights, we propose the Decoupled Graph Convolutional Network (D-GCN), a novel architecture that explicitly separates processing of a node's own transmission probability from neighbor interference effects. D-GCN replaces mean aggregation with learnable attention, yielding interpretable, per-neighbor contribution weights while capturing complex multihop interference patterns. D-GCN attains 3.3% NMAE, outperforms strong baselines, remains tractable even when exact analytical methods become computationally infeasible, and enables gradient-based network optimization that achieves within 1% of theoretical optima.

Title: NeuroPilot: A Realtime Brain-Computer Interface system to enhance concentration of students in online learning
Authors: Asif Islam, Farhan Ishtiaque, Md. Muhyminul Haque, Farhana Sarker, Ravi Vaidyanathan, Khondaker A. Mamun
Abstract: The prevalence of online learning poses a vital challenge in real-time monitoring of students' concentration. Traditional methods such as questionnaire assessments require manual intervention, and webcam-based monitoring fails to provide accurate insights about learners' mental focus as it is deceived by mere screen fixation without cognitive engagement. Existing BCI-based approaches lack real-time validation and evaluation procedures. To address these limitations, a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system is developed using a non-invasive Electroencephalogram (EEG) headband, FocusCalm, to record brainwave activity under attentive and non-attentive states. 20 minutes of data were collected from each of 20 participants watching a pre-recorded educational video. The data validation employed a novel intra-video questionnaire assessment. Subsequently, collected signals were segmented (sliding window), filtered (Butterworth bandpass), and cleaned (removal of high- amplitude and EOG artifacts such as eye blinks). Time, frequency, wavelet, and statistical features were extracted, followed by recursive feature elimination (RFE) with support vector machines (SVMs) to classify attention and non-attention states. The leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation accuracy was found to be 88.77%. The system provides feedback alerts upon detection of a non-attention state and maintains focus profile logs. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of real-time feedback. Five participants underwent a 10-minute session comprising a 5-minute baseline phase devoid of feedback, succeeded by a 5-minute feedback phase, during which alerts were activated if participants exhibited inattention for approximately 8 consecutive seconds. A paired t-test (t = 5.73, p = 0.007) indicated a statistically significant improvement in concentration during the feedback phase.

Title: Caption-Driven Explainability: Probing CNNs for Bias via CLIP

Schuster (Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences, Rapperswil, St. Gallen, Switzerland), Aggelos K. Katsaggelos (Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, United States)
Abstract: Robustness has become one of the most critical problems in machine learning (ML). The science of interpreting ML models to understand their behavior and improve their robustness is referred to as explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). One of the state-of-the-art XAI methods for computer vision problems is to generate saliency maps. A saliency map highlights the pixel space of an image that excites the ML model the most. However, this property could be misleading if spurious and salient features are present in overlapping pixel spaces. In this paper, we propose a caption-based XAI method, which integrates a standalone model to be explained into the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model using a novel network surgery approach. The resulting caption-based XAI model identifies the dominant concept that contributes the most to the models prediction. This explanation minimizes the risk of the standalone model falling for a covariate shift and contributes significantly towards developing robust ML models. Our code is available at <this https URL.

Abstract: While recent neural audio codecs deliver superior speech quality at ultralow bitrates over traditional methods, their practical adoption is hindered by obstacles related to low-resource operation and robustness to acoustic distortions. Edge deployment scenarios demand codecs that operate under stringent compute constraints while maintaining low latency and bitrate. The presence of background noise and reverberation further necessitates designs that are resilient to such degradations. The performance of neural codecs under these constraints and their integration with speech enhancement remain largely unaddressed. To catalyze progress in this area, we introduce the 2025 Low-Resource Audio Codec Challenge, which targets the development of neural and hybrid codecs for resource-constrained applications. Participants are supported with a standardized training dataset, two baseline systems, and a comprehensive evaluation framework. The challenge is expected to yield valuable insights applicable to both codec design and related downstream audio tasks.
