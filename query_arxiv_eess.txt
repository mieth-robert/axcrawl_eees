Title: AI-Enhanced Wi-Fi Sensing Through Single Transceiver Pair
Authors: Yuxuan Liu, Chiya Zhang, Yifeng Yuan, Chunlong He, Weizheng Zhang, Gaojie Chen
Abstract: The advancement of next-generation Wi-Fi technology heavily relies on sensing capabilities, which play a pivotal role in enabling sophisticated applications. In response to the growing demand for large-scale deployments, contemporary Wi-Fi sensing systems strive to achieve high-precision perception while maintaining minimal bandwidth consumption and antenna count requirements. Remarkably, various AI-driven perception technologies have demonstrated the ability to surpass the traditional resolution limitations imposed by radar theory. However, the theoretical underpinnings of this phenomenon have not been thoroughly investigated in existing research. In this study, we found that under hardware-constrained conditions, the performance gains brought by AI to Wi-Fi sensing systems primarily originate from two aspects: prior information and temporal correlation. Prior information enables the AI to generate plausible details based on vague input, while temporal correlation helps reduce the upper bound of sensing error. We developed an AI-based Wi-Fi sensing system using a single transceiver pair and designed experiments focusing on human pose estimation and indoor localization to validate the theoretical claims. The results confirm the performance gains contributed by temporal correlation and prior information.

Title: Spatio-Temporal Attention Network for Epileptic Seizure Prediction
Authors: Zan Li, Kyongmin Yeo, Wesley Gifford, Lara Marcuse, Madeline Fields, Bülent Yener
Abstract: In this study, we present a deep learning framework that learns complex spatio-temporal correlation structures of EEG signals through a Spatio-Temporal Attention Network (STAN) for accurate predictions of onset of seizures for Epilepsy patients. Unlike existing methods, which rely on feature engineering and/or assume fixed preictal durations, our approach simultaneously models spatio-temporal correlations through STAN and employs an adversarial discriminator to distinguish preictal from interictal attention patterns, enabling patient-specific learning. Evaluation on CHB-MIT and MSSM datasets demonstrates 96.6\% sensitivity with 0.011/h false detection rate on CHB-MIT, and 94.2% sensitivity with 0.063/h FDR on MSSM, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The framework reliably detects preictal states at least 15 minutes before an onset, with patient-specific windows extending to 45 minutes, providing sufficient intervention time for clinical applications.

Title: EEGReXferNet: A Lightweight Gen-AI Framework for EEG Subspace Reconstruction via Cross-Subject Transfer Learning and Channel-Aware Embedding
Authors: Shantanu Sarkar, Piotr Nabrzyski, Saurabh Prasad, Jose Luis Contreras-Vidal
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely used non-invasive technique for monitoring brain activity, but low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) due to various artifacts often compromise its utility. Conventional artifact removal methods require manual intervention or risk suppressing critical neural features during filtering/reconstruction. Recent advances in generative models, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have shown promise for EEG reconstruction; however, these approaches often lack integrated temporal-spectral-spatial sensitivity and are computationally intensive, limiting their suitability for real-time applications like brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). To overcome these challenges, we introduce EEGReXferNet, a lightweight Gen-AI framework for EEG subspace reconstruction via cross-subject transfer learning - developed using Keras TensorFlow (v2.15.1). EEGReXferNet employs a modular architecture that leverages volume conduction across neighboring channels, band-specific convolution encoding, and dynamic latent feature extraction through sliding windows. By integrating reference-based scaling, the framework ensures continuity across successive windows and generalizes effectively across subjects. This design improves spatial-temporal-spectral resolution (mean PSD correlation >= 0.95; mean spectrogram RV-Coefficient >= 0.85), reduces total weights by ~45% to mitigate overfitting, and maintains computational efficiency for robust, real-time EEG preprocessing in neurophysiological and BCI applications.

Title: Benchmarking ResNet for Short-Term Hypoglycemia Classification with DiaData
Authors: Beyza Cinar, Maria Maleshkova
Abstract: Individualized therapy is driven forward by medical data analysis, which provides insight into the patient's context. In particular, for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), which is an autoimmune disease, relationships between demographics, sensor data, and context can be analyzed. However, outliers, noisy data, and small data volumes cannot provide a reliable analysis. Hence, the research domain requires large volumes of high-quality data. Moreover, missing values can lead to information loss. To address this limitation, this study improves the data quality of DiaData, an integration of 15 separate datasets containing glucose values from 2510 subjects with T1D. Notably, we make the following contributions: 1) Outliers are identified with the interquartile range (IQR) approach and treated by replacing them with missing values. 2) Small gaps ($\le$ 25 min) are imputed with linear interpolation and larger gaps ($\ge$ 30 and $<$ 120 min) with Stineman interpolation. Based on a visual comparison, Stineman interpolation provides more realistic glucose estimates than linear interpolation for larger gaps. 3) After data cleaning, the correlation between glucose and heart rate is analyzed, yielding a moderate relation between 15 and 60 minutes before hypoglycemia ($\le$ 70 mg/dL). 4) Finally, a benchmark for hypoglycemia classification is provided with a state-of-the-art ResNet model. The model is trained with the Maindatabase and Subdatabase II of DiaData to classify hypoglycemia onset up to 2 hours in advance. Training with more data improves performance by 7% while using quality-refined data yields a 2-3% gain compared to raw data.

Title: ECGXtract: Deep Learning-based ECG Feature Extraction for Automated CVD Diagnosis
Authors: Youssif Abuzied, Hassan AbdEltawab, Abdelrhman Gaber, Tamer ElBatt
Abstract: This paper presents ECGXtract, a deep learning-based approach for interpretable ECG feature extraction, addressing the limitations of traditional signal processing and black-box machine learning methods. In particular, we develop convolutional neural network models capable of extracting both temporal and morphological features with strong correlations to a clinically validated ground truth. Initially, each model is trained to extract a single feature, ensuring precise and interpretable outputs. A series of experiments is then carried out to evaluate the proposed method across multiple setups, including global versus lead-specific features, different sampling frequencies, and comparisons with other approaches such as ECGdeli. Our findings show that ECGXtract achieves robust performance across most features with a mean correlation score of 0.80 with the ground truth for global features, with lead II consistently providing the best results. For lead-specific features, ECGXtract achieves a mean correlation score of 0.822. Moreover, ECGXtract achieves superior results to the state-of-the-art open source ECGdeli as it got a higher correlation score with the ground truth in 90% of the features. Furthermore, we explore the feasibility of extracting multiple features simultaneously utilizing a single model. Semantic grouping is proved to be effective for global features, while large-scale grouping and lead-specific multi-output models show notable performance drops. These results highlight the potential of structured grouping strategies to balance the computational efficiency vs. model accuracy, paving the way for more scalable and clinically interpretable ECG feature extraction systems in limited resource settings.

Title: Approaching Low-Cost Cardiac Intelligence with Semi-Supervised Knowledge Distillation
Authors: Rushuang Zhou, Yuan-Ting Zhang, M.Jamal Deen, Yining Dong
Abstract: Deploying advanced cardiac artificial intelligence for daily cardiac monitoring is hindered by its reliance on extensive medical data and high computational resources. Low-cost cardiac intelligence (LCCI) offers a promising alternative by using wearable device data, such as 1-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), but it suffers from a significant diagnostic performance gap compared to high-cost cardiac intelligence (HCCI). To bridge this gap, we propose LiteHeart, a semi-supervised knowledge distillation framework. LiteHeart introduces a region-aware distillation module to mimic how cardiologists focus on diagnostically relevant ECG regions and a cross-layer mutual information module to align the decision processes of LCCI and HCCI systems. Using a semi-supervised training strategy, LiteHeart further improves model robustness under limited supervision. Evaluated on five datasets covering over 38 cardiovascular diseases, LiteHeart substantially reduces the performance gap between LCCI and HCCI, outperforming existing methods by 4.27% to 7.10% in macro F1 score. These results demonstrate that LiteHeart significantly enhances the diagnostic capabilities of low-cost cardiac intelligence systems, paving the way for scalable, affordable, and accurate daily cardiac healthcare using wearable technologies.

Authors: Shengze Xue, Yu Ren, Jiacheng Hong, Run Ni, Shuangjiu Xiao, Deli Dong
Abstract: Fast Fourier Transform-based (FFT) spectral oceans are widely adopted for their efficiency and large-scale realism, but they assume global stationarity and spatial homogeneity, making it difficult to represent non-uniform seas and near-field interactions (e.g., ships and floaters). In contrast, wave particles capture local wakes and ripples, yet are costly to maintain at scale and hard to match global spectral this http URL present a real-time interactive hybrid ocean: a global FFT background coupled with local wave-particle (WP) patch regions around interactive objects, jointly driven under a unified set of spectral parameters and dispersion. At patch boundaries, particles are injected according to the same directional spectrum as the FFT, aligning the local frequency-direction distribution with the background and matching energy density, without disturbing the far this http URL approach introduces two main innovations: (1) Hybrid ocean representation. We couple a global FFT background with local WP patches under a unified spectrum, achieving large-scale spectral consistency while supporting localized wakes and ripples.(2) Frequency-bucketed implementation. We design a particle sampling and GPU-parallel synthesis scheme based on frequency buckets, which preserves spectral energy consistency and sustains real-time interactive this http URL, these innovations enable a unified framework that delivers both large-scale spectral realism and fine-grained interactivity in real time.

Title: Consciousness-ECG Transformer for Conscious State Estimation System with Real-Time Monitoring
Authors: Young-Seok Kweon, Gi-Hwan Shin, Ji-Yong Kim, Bokyeong Ryu, Seong-Whan Lee
Abstract: Conscious state estimation is important in various medical settings, including sleep staging and anesthesia management, to ensure patient safety and optimize health outcomes. Traditional methods predominantly utilize electroencephalography (EEG), which faces challenges such as high sensitivity to noise and the requirement for controlled environments. In this study, we propose the consciousness-ECG transformer that leverages electrocardiography (ECG) signals for non-invasive and reliable conscious state estimation. Our approach employs a transformer with decoupled query attention to effectively capture heart rate variability features that distinguish between conscious and unconscious states. We implemented the conscious state estimation system with real-time monitoring and validated our system on datasets involving sleep staging and anesthesia level monitoring during surgeries. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms baseline models, achieving accuracies of 0.877 on sleep staging and 0.880 on anesthesia level monitoring. Moreover, our model achieves the highest area under curve values of 0.786 and 0.895 on sleep staging and anesthesia level monitoring, respectively. The proposed system offers a practical and robust alternative to EEG-based methods, particularly suited for dynamic clinical environments. Our results highlight the potential of ECG-based consciousness monitoring to enhance patient safety and advance our understanding of conscious states.

Title: NEF-NET+: Adapting Electrocardio panorama in the wild
Authors: Zehui Zhan, Yaojun Hu, Jiajing Zhan, Wanchen Lian, Wanqing Wu, Jintai Chen
Abstract: Conventional multi-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) systems capture cardiac signals from a fixed set of anatomical viewpoints defined by lead placement. However, certain cardiac conditions (e.g., Brugada syndrome) require additional, non-standard viewpoints to reveal diagnostically critical patterns that may be absent in standard leads. To systematically overcome this limitation, Nef-Net was recently introduced to reconstruct a continuous electrocardiac field, enabling virtual observation of ECG signals from arbitrary views (termed Electrocardio Panorama). Despite its promise, Nef-Net operates under idealized assumptions and faces in-the-wild challenges, such as long-duration ECG modeling, robustness to device-specific signal artifacts, and suboptimal lead placement calibration. This paper presents NEF-NET+, an enhanced framework for realistic panoramic ECG synthesis that supports arbitrary-length signal synthesis from any desired view, generalizes across ECG devices, and com- pensates for operator-induced deviations in electrode placement. These capabilities are enabled by a newly designed model architecture that performs direct view transformation, incorporating a workflow comprising offline pretraining, device calibration tuning steps as well as an on-the-fly calibration step for patient-specific adaptation. To rigorously evaluate panoramic ECG synthesis, we construct a new Electrocardio Panorama benchmark, called Panobench, comprising 5367 recordings with 48-view per subject, capturing the full spatial variability of cardiac electrical activity. Experimental results show that NEF-NET+ delivers substantial improvements over Nef-Net, yielding an increase of around 6 dB in PSNR in real-world setting. The code and Panobench will be released in a subsequent publication.

Title: Adaptive Internal Calibration for Temperature-Robust mmWave FMCW Radars
Authors: Dariush Salami, Nima Bahmani, Hüseyin Yiğitler, Stephan Sigg
Abstract: We present a novel internal calibration framework for Millimeter- Wave (mmWave) Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radars to ensure robust performance under internal temperature variations, tailored for deployment in dense wireless networks. Our approach mitigates the impact of temperature-induced drifts in radar hardware, enhancing reliability. We propose a temperature compensation model that leverages internal sensor data and signal processing techniques to maintain measurement accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate improved robustness across a range of internal temperature conditions, with minimal computational overhead, ensuring scalability in dense network environments. The framework also incorporates ethical design principles, avoiding reliance on sensitive external data. The proposed scheme reduces the Pearson correlation between the amplitude of the Intermediate Frequency (IF) signal and internal temperature drift up to 84%, significantly mitigating the temperature drift.

Title: Optimizing the nnU-Net model for brain tumor (Glioma) segmentation Using a BraTS Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) dataset
Authors: Chukwuemeka Arua Kalu, Adaobi Chiazor Emegoakor, Fortune Okafor, Augustine Okoh Uchenna, Chijioke Kelvin Ukpai, Godsent Erere Onyeugbo
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical achievement in modern medical science, developed over decades of research. It allows for the exact delineation of anatomical and pathological features in two- or three-dimensional pictures by utilizing notions like pixel intensity, texture, and anatomical context. With the advent of automated segmentation, physicians and radiologists may now concentrate on diagnosis and treatment planning while intelligent computers perform routine image processing tasks. This study used the BraTS Sub-Saharan Africa dataset, a selected subset of the BraTS dataset that included 60 multimodal MRI cases from patients with glioma. Surprisingly, the nnU Net model trained on the initial 60 instances performed better than the network trained on an offline-augmented dataset of 360 cases. Hypothetically, the offline augmentations introduced artificial anatomical variances or intensity distributions, reducing generalization. In contrast, the original dataset, when paired with nnU Net's robust online augmentation procedures, maintained realistic variability and produced better results. The study achieved a Dice score of 0.84 for whole tumor segmentation. These findings highlight the significance of data quality and proper augmentation approaches in constructing accurate, generalizable medical picture segmentation models, particularly for under-represented locations.

Title: Domain-Adaptive Transformer for Data-Efficient Glioma Segmentation in Sub-Saharan MRI
Authors: Ilerioluwakiiye Abolade, Aniekan Udo, Augustine Ojo, Abdulbasit Oyetunji, Hammed Ajigbotosho, Aondana Iorumbur, Confidence Raymond, Maruf Adewole
Abstract: Glioma segmentation is critical for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet remains challenging in Sub-Saharan Africa due to limited MRI infrastructure and heterogeneous acquisition protocols that induce severe domain shift. We propose SegFormer3D-plus, a radiomics-guided transformer architecture designed for robust segmentation under domain variability. Our method combines: (1) histogram matching for intensity harmonization across scanners, (2) radiomic feature extraction with PCA-reduced k-means for domain-aware stratified sampling, (3) a dual-pathway encoder with frequency-aware feature extraction and spatial-channel attention, and (4) composite Dice-Cross-Entropy loss for boundary refinement. Pretrained on BraTS 2023 and fine-tuned on BraTS-Africa data, SegFormer3D-plus demonstrates improved tumor subregion delineation and boundary localization across heterogeneous African clinical scans, highlighting the value of radiomics-guided domain adaptation for resource-limited settings.

Title: From Narrow to Wide: Autoencoding Transformers for Ultrasound Bandwidth Recovery
Authors: Sepideh KhakzadGharamaleki, Hassan Rivaz, Brandon Helfield
Abstract: Conventional pulse-echo ultrasound suffers when low-cost probes deliver only narrow fractional bandwidths, elongating pulses and erasing high-frequency detail. We address this limitation by learning a data-driven mapping from band-limited to broadband spectrogram of radio-frequency (RF) lines. To this end, a variation of Tiny Vision Transform (ViT) auto-encoder is trained on simulation data using a curriculum-weighted loss. On heterogeneous speckle-cyst phantoms, the network reduces image-domain MSE by 90 percent, boosts PSNR by 6.7 dB, and raises SSIM to 0.965 compared with the narrow-band input. It also sharpens point-target rows in a completely unseen resolution phantom, demonstrating strong out-of-distribution generalisation without sacrificing frame rate or phase information. These results indicate that a purely software upgrade can endow installed narrow-band probes with broadband-like performance, potentially widening access to high-resolution ultrasound in resource-constrained settings.

Title: Robust reduced-order model predictive control using peak-to-peak analysis of filtered signals
Authors: Johannes Köhler, Carlo Scholz, Melanie Zeilinger
Abstract: We address the design of a model predictive control (MPC) scheme for large-scale linear systems using reduced-order models (ROMs). Our approach uses a ROM, leverages tools from robust control, and integrates them into an MPC framework to achieve computational tractability with robust constraint satisfaction. Our key contribution is a method to obtain guaranteed bounds on the predicted outputs of the full-order system by predicting a (scalar) error-bounding system alongside the ROM. This bound is then used to formulate a robust ROM-based MPC that guarantees constraint satisfaction and robust performance. Our method is developed step-by-step by (i) analysing the error, (ii) bounding the peak-to-peak gain, an (iii) using filtered signals. We demonstrate our method on a 100-dimensional mass-spring-damper system, achieving over four orders of magnitude reduction in conservatism relative to existing approaches.

Title: Oscillation Analysis and Damping Control for a Proposed North American AC-DC Macrogrid
Authors: Kaustav Chatterjee, Sameer Nekkalapu, Antos Varghese, Marcelo Elizondo, Quan Nguyen, Xiaoyuan Fan
Abstract: In recent years, several studies conducted by both industry and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)-funded initiatives have proposed linking North America's Eastern and Western Interconnections (EI and WI) through a multiterminal DC (MTDC) macrogrid. These studies have explored the advantages and opportunities of the proposed configuration from the perspectives of capacity sharing and frequency support. However, the potential challenges of small-signal stability arising from this interconnection have not been thoroughly examined. To address this gap, detailed model-based simulation studies are performed in this paper to assess the risks of poorly damped inter-area oscillations in the proposed macrogrid. A custom-built dynamic model of the MTDC system is developed and integrated with industry-grade models of the EI and WI, incorporating high levels of inverter-based energy resources. Through model-based oscillation analysis, potential shifts in inter-area modes for both EI and WI, resulting from the MTDC integration are characterized, and modes with inadequate damping are identified. Furthermore, to mitigate the risks of unstable oscillations, supplementary damping controllers are designed for the MTDC system, leveraging wide-area feedback to modulate active power set points at selected converter stations. A frequency scanning approach is employed for data-driven model linearization and controller synthesis. The damping performance is evaluated under the designed operating conditions and selected contingency scenarios.

Title: Quantifying Power Systems Resilience Using Statistical Analysis and Bayesian Learning
Authors: Apsara Adhikari, Charlotte Wertz, Anamika Dubey, Arslan Ahmad, Ian Dobson
Abstract: The increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events is significantly affecting the power grid, causing large-scale outages and impacting power system resilience. Yet limited work has been done on systematically modeling the impacts of weather parameters to quantify resilience. This study presents a framework using statistical and Bayesian learning approaches to quantitatively model the relationship between weather parameters and power system resilience metrics. By leveraging real-world publicly available outage and weather data, we identify key weather variables of wind speed, temperature, and precipitation influencing a particular region's resilience metrics. A case study of Cook County, Illinois, and Miami-Dade County, Florida, reveals that these weather parameters are critical factors in resiliency analysis and risk assessment. Additionally, we find that these weather variables have combined effects when studied jointly compared to their effects in isolation. This framework provides valuable insights for understanding how weather events affect power distribution system performance, supporting decision-makers in developing more effective strategies for risk mitigation, resource allocation, and adaptation to changing climatic conditions.

Title: Microgrids optimal radial reconfiguration via FORWARD algorithm
Authors: Joan Vendrell Gallart, Russell Bent, Solmaz Kia
Abstract: Microgrids offer a promising paradigm for integrating distributed energy resources, bolstering energy resilience, and reducing the impact of blackouts. However, their inherent decentralization and dynamic operation present substantial energy management complexities. These complexities, including balancing supply and demand, ensuring system stability, and minimizing operational costs, often necessitate solving computationally intractable NP-hard Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) problems. Traditional MINLP solvers struggle with the scalability and feasibility guarantees required for these challenges. To address this, this paper tackles the problem of resource allocation and radial configuration design for microgrid power distribution and proposes and abstracted problem which is solved by introducing a permutation-based iterative search method over the recently introduced FORWARD method to efficiently identify feasible, near-optimal radial network structures while inherently respecting physical constraints. Furthermore, this paper investigates the integration of the proposed method as a warm-start strategy for benchmark MINLP solvers offering a scalable solution for comprehensive microgrid design.

Title: Quantifying Articulatory Coordination as a Biomarker for Schizophrenia
Authors: Gowtham Premananth, Carol Espy-Wilson
Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have improved diagnostic capabilities in healthcare, yet limited interpretability continues to hinder clinical adoption. Schizophrenia, a complex disorder with diverse symptoms including disorganized speech and social withdrawal, demands tools that capture symptom severity and provide clinically meaningful insights beyond binary diagnosis. Here, we present an interpretable framework that leverages articulatory speech features through eigenspectra difference plots and a weighted sum with exponential decay (WSED) to quantify vocal tract coordination. Eigenspectra plots effectively distinguished complex from simpler coordination patterns, and WSED scores reliably separated these groups, with ambiguity confined to a narrow range near zero. Importantly, WSED scores correlated not only with overall BPRS severity but also with the balance between positive and negative symptoms, reflecting more complex coordination in subjects with pronounced positive symptoms and the opposite trend for stronger negative symptoms. This approach offers a transparent, severity-sensitive biomarker for schizophrenia, advancing the potential for clinically interpretable speech-based assessment tools.

Title: Speech-Based Prioritization for Schizophrenia Intervention
Authors: Gowtham Premananth, Philip Resnik, Sonia Bansal, Deanna L.Kelly, Carol Espy-Wilson
Abstract: Millions of people suffer from mental health conditions, yet many remain undiagnosed or receive delayed care due to limited clinical resources and labor-intensive assessment methods. While most machine-assisted approaches focus on diagnostic classification, estimating symptom severity is essential for prioritizing care, particularly in resource-constrained settings. Speech-based AI provides a scalable alternative by enabling automated, continuous, and remote monitoring, reducing reliance on subjective self-reports and time-consuming evaluations. In this paper, we introduce a speech-based model for pairwise comparison of schizophrenia symptom severity, leveraging articulatory and acoustic features. These comparisons are used to generate severity rankings via the Bradley-Terry model. Our approach outperforms previous regression-based models on ranking-based metrics, offering a more effective solution for clinical triage and prioritization.

Title: Consensus Tracking of an Underwater Vehicle Using Weighted Harmonic Mean Density
Authors: Ved Prakash Dubey, Shovan Bhaumik
Abstract: This paper addresses an underwater target tracking problem in which a large number of sonobuoy sensors are deployed on a surveillance region. The region is divided into several sub-regions, where a single tracker, capable of generating track is installed. Each sonobuoy can measure the direction of arrival of acoustic signals (known as bearing angles) and communicate the measurements with the local tracker. Further, each local tracker can communicate with all other trackers, where each of them can exchange their estimate and finally a consensus is reached. We propose a weighted harmonic mean density (HMD) based tracking to reach a consensus and provide a solution for the fusion of Gaussian densities. In this approach, optimal weights are assigned by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure. Performance of the proposed method is measured using root mean square error, percentage of track divergence, and normalized estimation error squared. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimized HMD-based fusion outperforms existing fusion methods during a distributed tracking.

Title: Analysis and Algorithm for Multi IRS Collaborative Localization via Hybrid Time Angle Estimation
Authors: Ziheng Zhang, Wen Chen, Qingqing Wu, Haoran Qin, Zhendong Li, Qiong Wu
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel multiple intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) collaborative hybrid localization system, which involves deploying multiple IRSs near the target area and achieving target localization through joint time delay and angle estimation. Specifically, echo signals from all reflective elements are received by each sensor and jointly processed to estimate the time delay and angle parameters. Based on the above model, we derive the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) for cascaded delay, Angle of Arrival (AOA), and Angle of Departure (AOD) estimation in semi passive passive models, along with the corresponding Cramer Rao Bound (CRB). To achieve precise estimation close to the CRB, we design efficient algorithms for angle and location estimation. For angle estimation, reflective signals are categorized into three cases based on their rank, with different signal preprocessing. By constructing an atomic norm set and minimizing the atomic norm, the joint angle estimation problem is transformed into a convex optimization problem, and low-complexity estimation of multiple AOA and AOD pairs is achieved using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). For location estimation, we propose a three-stage localization algorithm that combines weighted least squares, total least squares, and quadratic correction to handle errors in the coefficient matrix and observation vector, thus improving accuracy. Numerical simulations validate the superiority of the proposed system, demonstrating that the system's collaboration, hybrid localization, and distributed deployment provide substantial benefits, as well as the accuracy of the proposed estimation algorithms, particularly in low signal to noise ratio (SNR) condition.

Title: Active Noise Control Method Using Time Domain Neural Networks for Path Decoupling
Authors: Yijing Chu, Qinxuan Xiang, Sipei Zhao, Ming Wu, Y. Zhao, Guangzheng Yu
Abstract: In decentralized active noise control (ANC) systems, crosstalk between multichannel secondary sources and error microphones significantly degrades control accuracy. Moreover, prefiltering reference signals in filtered-x (Fx) type algorithms may further introduce modeling errors. A theoretical analysis of the Fx-based decentralized control algorithm was performed, which reveals how prefiltering and crosstalk affect the control performance. Then, a hybrid method combining fixed-value neural networks and adaptive strategies was proposed for efficient decentralized ANC. The adaptive filter models the primary path of its own channel online using the least mean square (LMS) algorithm while the neural network (named DecNet) is used for secondary paths inverting and decoupling. The hybrid DecNet-LMS algorithm was implemented in the time domain to guarantee causality and avoid latency. Simulation results with measured acoustic paths show that the proposed method outperforms the existing ANC algorithms using either traditional adaptive filters or neural network-based fixed-coefficient methods under different acoustic conditions.

Title: SAAIPAA: Optimizing aspect-angles-invariant physical adversarial attacks on SAR target recognition models
Authors: Isar Lemeire, Yee Wei Law, Sang-Heon Lee, Will Meakin, Tat-Jun Chin
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) enables versatile, all-time, all-weather remote sensing. Coupled with automatic target recognition (ATR) leveraging machine learning (ML), SAR is empowering a wide range of Earth observation and surveillance applications. However, the surge of attacks based on adversarial perturbations against the ML algorithms underpinning SAR ATR is prompting the need for systematic research into adversarial perturbation mechanisms. Research in this area began in the digital (image) domain and evolved into the physical (signal) domain, resulting in physical adversarial attacks (PAAs) that strategically exploit corner reflectors as attack vectors to evade ML-based ATR. This paper proposes a novel framework called SAR Aspect-Angles-Invariant Physical Adversarial Attack (SAAIPAA) for physics-based modelling of reflector-actuated adversarial perturbations, which improves on the rigor of prior work. A unique feature of SAAIPAA is its ability to remain effective even when the attacker lacks knowledge of the SAR platform's aspect angles, by deploying at least one reflector in each azimuthal quadrant and optimizing reflector orientations. The resultant physical evasion attacks are efficiently realizable and optimal over the considered range of aspect angles between a SAR platform and a target, achieving state-of-the-art fooling rates (over 80% for DenseNet-121 and ResNet50) in the white-box setting. When aspect angles are known to the attacker, an average fooling rate of 99.2% is attainable. In black-box settings, although the attack efficacy of SAAIPAA transfers well between some models (e.g., from ResNet50 to DenseNet121), the transferability to some models (e.g., MobileNetV2) can be improved. A useful outcome of using the MSTAR dataset for the experiments in this article, a method for generating bounding boxes for densely sampled azimuthal SAR datasets is introduced.

Title: MHE in Output Feedback Control of Uncertain Nonlinear Systems via IQCs
Authors: Yang Guo, Stefan Streif
Abstract: We propose a moving horizon estimation (MHE) scheme for general nonlinear constrained systems with parametric or static nonlinear uncertainties and a predetermined state feedback controller that is assumed to robustly stabilize the system in the absence of estimation errors. Leveraging integral quadratic constraints (IQCs), we introduce a new notion of detectability that is robust to possibly non-parametric uncertainties and verifiable in practice. Assuming that the uncertain system driven by the controller satisfies this notion of detectability, we provide an MHE formulation such that the closed-loop system formed of the uncertain system, the controller and MHE is input-to-state stable w.r.t. exogenous disturbances.

Title: Theoretical and Experimental Limitations of RoCoF Estimation
Authors: Gutierrez-Florensa, F. Sanniti, D. Tedeschi, L. Sigrist, A. Ortega, F. Milano
Abstract: A precise estimation of the Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF) is crucial for secure power system operation. In fact, RoCoF is strictly related to the amount of the available physical and/or virtual inertia of the system and the severity of the active power unbalance following a disturbance. For this reason, it is widely exploited in different protection systems, e.g., Anti-Islanding, Under Frequency Load Shedding (UFLS) and wide-area protection systems. The new paradigm of modern power systems, with a low-inertia and converter-based generation assets, is increasing the transient severity, making the frequency and the RoCoF estimation more complex and less precise for the actual devices. This work addresses this issue by proposing a numerically robust approach based on concepts inherited from differential geometry and fluid mechanics. The proposed approach is then tested with high-sampling real experimental measurements and used to develop a faster control logic for a RoCoF-based UFLS control scheme. The proposed approach provides information to protections regarding the nature of the contingency which can be used to improve its response.

Title: Integrated Sensing and Communication with UAV Swarms via Decentralized Consensus ADMM
Authors: Zhiyuan Zhai, Wei Ni, Xin Wang, Dusit Niyato, Ekram Hossain
Abstract: UAV swarms can form virtual antenna arrays to exploit additional spatial degrees of freedom and enhance integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). The optimization of UAV positions is challenging due to the distributed nature of swarms and the lack of a global view at individual UAVs. This paper presents a new decentralized optimization framework that allows UAVs to decide their locations in parallel and reach consensus on a globally optimal swarm geometry for ISAC. Specifically, we derive the achievable uplink rate and Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB) as tractable metrics for communication and sensing, respectively. The UAV positions are optimized to balance maximizing the communication rate and minimizing the CRB. To solve this non-convex problem with coupled variables, we develop a decentralized consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm, which enables the UAVs to iteratively align their local updates and reach consensus. The algorithm decomposes the global objective into local projection updates, proxy-assisted consensus coordination, and lightweight dual updates, ensuring scalability and consistency throughout the swarm. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed consensus ADMM algorithm converges rapidly with strong scalability, and that the UAV swarm significantly outperforms fixed-array baselines in both communication and sensing performance.

Title: Decentralized Federated Learning with Distributed Aggregation Weight Optimization
Authors: Zhiyuan Zhai, Xiaojun Yuan, Xin Wang, Geoffrey Ye Li
Abstract: Decentralized federated learning (DFL) is an emerging paradigm to enable edge devices collaboratively training a learning model using a device-to-device (D2D) communication manner without the coordination of a parameter server (PS). Aggregation weights, also known as mixing weights, are crucial in DFL process, and impact the learning efficiency and accuracy. Conventional design relies on a so-called central entity to collect all local information and conduct system optimization to obtain appropriate weights. In this paper, we develop a distributed aggregation weight optimization algorithm to align with the decentralized nature of DFL. We analyze convergence by quantitatively capturing the impact of the aggregation weights over decentralized communication networks. Based on the analysis, we then formulate a learning performance optimization problem by designing the aggregation weights to minimize the derived convergence bound. The optimization problem is further transformed as an eigenvalue optimization problem and solved by our proposed subgradient-based algorithm in a distributed fashion. In our algorithm, edge devices only need local information to obtain the optimal aggregation weights through local (D2D) communications, just like the learning itself. Therefore, the optimization, communication, and learning process can be all conducted in a distributed fashion, which leads to a genuinely distributed DFL system. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in practical DFL deployment.

Title: Diffusion-Driven Terahertz Air-Ground Communications under Dynamic Atmospheric Turbulence
Authors: Jinhao Yi, Weijun Gao, Chong Han
Abstract: The ever-increasing demand for ultra-high data rates in space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs) has rendered terahertz THz communications a promising technology owing to its exceptionally broad and continuous spectrum resources. Nevertheless, in air-ground (AG) scenarios, the high mobility of aircraft induces intense and rapidly fluctuating turbulence, leading to additional propagation loss that is often overlooked in existing studies. To bridge this gap, this paper presents an AI-empowered THz AG communication framework that explicitly models turbulence-induced attenuation through fluid dynamics and integrates it into an adaptive optimization paradigm for communication performance enhancement. Specifically, a fluid-dynamics-informed attenuation model is established to characterize aircraft-generated turbulence and quantify its impact on THz signal propagation. Building upon this model, a joint power-attitude optimization problem is formulated to adaptively allocate transmit power and adjust aircraft attitude for maximizing link capacity. The optimization problem is efficiently solved using a diffusion-based algorithm that learns the nonlinear relationship between flight configuration and turbulence-induced attenuation. Comprehensive numerical evaluations demonstrate that the turbulence-induced attenuation ranges from 18 to 28 dB under attacking angles between -10 degree and 10 degree at 0.7 Mach, verifying the pronounced impact of aircraft-induced turbulence on THz propagation. Furthermore, the proposed framework attains an average capacity of 11.241 bps/Hz, substantially outperforming existing strategies by 22.8% and 66.5%, and approaching approximately 98% of the theoretical capacity limit.

Title: Spectral-Convergent Decentralized Machine Learning: Theory and Application in Space Networks
Authors: Zhiyuan Zhai, Shuyan Hu, Wei Ni, Xiaojun Yuan, Xin Wang
Abstract: Decentralized machine learning (DML) supports collaborative training in large-scale networks with no central server. It is sensitive to the quality and reliability of inter-device communications that result in time-varying and stochastic topologies. This paper studies the impact of unreliable communication on the convergence of DML and establishes a direct connection between the spectral properties of the mixing process and the global performance. We provide rigorous convergence guarantees under random topologies and derive bounds that characterize the impact of the expected mixing matrix's spectral properties on learning. We formulate a spectral optimization problem that minimizes the spectral radius of the expected second-order mixing matrix to enhance the convergence rate under probabilistic link failures. To solve this non-smooth spectral problem in a fully decentralized manner, we design an efficient subgradient-based algorithm that integrates Chebyshev-accelerated eigenvector estimation with local update and aggregation weight adjustment, while ensuring symmetry and stochasticity constraints without central coordination. Experiments on a realistic low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation with time-varying inter-satellite link models and real-world remote sensing data demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. The method significantly improves classification accuracy and convergence efficiency compared to existing baselines, validating its applicability in satellite and other decentralized systems.

Title: UAV SAR Imaging with 5G NR OFDM Signals in NLOS Environments
Authors: Qiuyuan Yang, Cunhua Pan, Ruidong Li, Zhenkun Zhang, Hong Ren, Changhong Wang, Jiangzhou Wang
Abstract: The integration of sensing and communication (ISAC) has significant potential for future wireless systems, enabling efficient spectrum utilization and novel application scenarios. In this paper, we propose a cooperative ISAC framework for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging by leveraging orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication signals. We address the challenge of severe imaging degradation in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environments under the QUAsi Deterministic RadIo channel GenerAtor (QuaDRiGa). To detect weak signals and eliminate false points, we develop a two-stage compressed sensing-space alternating generalized expectation maximization (CS-SAGE) scheme for high-precision scatterer localization. In stage I, orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) is employed for coarse estimation to identify the approximate locations of dominant scatterers. Then, the SAGE algorithm in stage II performs fine estimation to accurately extract scatterer parameters. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative ISAC framework, and provide valuable insights for practical system design.

Title: Evolutionary Dynamics in Continuous-time Finite-state Mean Field Games - Part II: Stability
Authors: Leonardo Pedroso, Andrea Agazzi, W.P.M.H. Heemels, Mauro Salazar
Abstract: We study a dynamic game with a large population of players who choose actions from a finite set in continuous time. Each player has a state in a finite state space that evolves stochastically with their actions. A player's reward depends not only on their own state and action but also on the distribution of states and actions across the population, capturing effects such as congestion in traffic networks. In Part I, we introduced an evolutionary model and a new solution concept - the mixed stationary Nash Equilibrium (MSNE) - which coincides with the rest points of the mean field evolutionary model under meaningful families of revision protocols. In this second part, we investigate the evolutionary stability of MSNE. We derive conditions on both the structure of the MSNE and the game's payoff map that ensure local and global stability under evolutionary dynamics. These results characterize when MSNE can robustly emerge and persist against strategic deviations, thereby providing insight into its long-term viability in large population dynamic games.

Title: C-RAN Advanced: From a Network Cooperation Perspective
Authors: Xiaoyun Wang, Yutong Zhang, Sen Wang, Sun Qi, Hanning Wang, Qixing Wang, Jing Jin, Jiwei He, Nan Li
Abstract: Future mobile networks in the sixth generation (6G) are poised for a paradigm shift from conventional communication services toward comprehensive information services, driving the evolution of radio access network (RAN) architectures toward enhanced cooperation, intelligence, and service orientation. Building upon the concept of centralized, collaborative, cloud, and clean RAN (C-RAN), this article proposes a novel cooperative, intelligent, and service-based RAN (CIS-RAN) architecture. Focusing on cooperation, CIS-RAN extends the traditional cooperative communication paradigm by further integrating cooperative sensing and cooperative artificial intelligence (AI). To improve both performance and effectiveness across diverse application scenarios, CIS-RAN enhances network cooperation throughout the entire process of acquisition, transmission, and processing, thereby enabling efficient information acquisition, diverse cooperative interactions, and intelligent fusion decision-making. Key technologies are discussed, with network cooperative multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) examined as a case study, demonstrating superior performance over traditional architectures, as demonstrated by numerical results. Future research directions are outlined, emphasizing the continued exploration and advancement of the CIS-RAN architecture, particularly in enhancing network cooperation.

Title: TASU: Text-Only Alignment for Speech Understanding
Authors: Jing Peng, Yi Yang, Xu Li, Yu Xi, Quanwei Tang, Yangui Fang, Junjie Li, Kai Yu
Abstract: Recent advances in Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs) have paved the way for unified architectures across diverse speech understanding tasks. However, prevailing alignment paradigms rely heavily on large-scale audio-text paired data and computationally intensive training, yet often exhibit limited generalization to unseen domains or tasks. To address these limitations, we propose TASU (Text-only Alignment for Speech Understanding), a novel alignment paradigm that can leverage only unpaired text data to guide cross-modal alignment. Experiments show that TASU achieves competitive zero-shot speech recognition. Leveraging this property, it can further function as a pre-training stage in curriculum learning, enhancing domain generalization in speech recognition. Ultimately, TASU can extend its zero-shot generalization to a wide range of speech understanding tasks and notably outperforms prominent Speech LLMs including GLM-4-Voice and Step-Audio on the MMSU benchmark, establishing TASU as an efficient and scalable alignment paradigm for Speech LLMs.

Authors: Riccardo Tripodi
Abstract: This work introduces audio2chart, a framework for the automatic generation of Guitar Hero style charts directly from raw audio. The task is formalized as a sequence prediction problem, where models are trained to generate discrete chart tokens aligned with the audio on discrete time steps. An unconditional baseline demonstrates strong predictive performance, while the addition of audio conditioning yields consistent improvements across accuracy based metrics. This work demonstrates that incorporating audio conditioning is both feasible and effective for improving note prediction in automatic chart generation.

Title: Open Source State-Of-the-Art Solution for Romanian Speech Recognition
Authors: Gabriel Pirlogeanu, Alexandru-Lucian Georgescu, Horia Cucu
Abstract: In this work, we present a new state-of-the-art Romanian Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system based on NVIDIA's FastConformer architecture--explored here for the first time in the context of Romanian. We train our model on a large corpus of, mostly, weakly supervised transcriptions, totaling over 2,600 hours of speech. Leveraging a hybrid decoder with both Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) and Token-Duration Transducer (TDT) branches, we evaluate a range of decoding strategies including greedy, ALSD, and CTC beam search with a 6-gram token-level language model. Our system achieves state-of-the-art performance across all Romanian evaluation benchmarks, including read, spontaneous, and domain-specific speech, with up to 27% relative WER reduction compared to previous best-performing systems. In addition to improved transcription accuracy, our approach demonstrates practical decoding efficiency, making it suitable for both research and deployment in low-latency ASR applications.

Title: Morpho-Genomic Deep Learning for Ovarian Cancer Subtype and Gene Mutation Prediction from Histopathology
Authors: Gabriela Fernandes
Abstract: Ovarian cancer remains one of the most lethal gynecological malignancies, largely due to late diagnosis and extensive heterogeneity across subtypes. Current diagnostic methods are limited in their ability to reveal underlying genomic variations essential for precision oncology. This study introduces a novel hybrid deep learning pipeline that integrates quantitative nuclear morphometry with deep convolutional image features to perform ovarian cancer subtype classification and gene mutation inference directly from Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) histopathological images. Using $\sim45,000$ image patches sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and public datasets, a fusion model combining a ResNet-50 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) encoder and a Vision Transformer (ViT) was developed. This model successfully captured both local morphological texture and global tissue context. The pipeline achieved a robust overall subtype classification accuracy of $84.2\%$ (Macro AUC of $0.87 \pm 0.03$). Crucially, the model demonstrated the capacity for gene mutation inference with moderate-to-high accuracy: $AUC_{TP53} = 0.82 \pm 0.02$, $AUC_{BRCA1} = 0.76 \pm 0.04$, and $AUC_{ARID1A} = 0.73 \pm 0.05$. Feature importance analysis established direct quantitative links, revealing that nuclear solidity and eccentricity were the dominant predictors for TP53 mutation. These findings validate that quantifiable histological phenotypes encode measurable genomic signals, paving the way for cost-effective, precision histopathology in ovarian cancer triage and diagnosis.

Title: Lightwave Power Transfer-Enabled Underwater Optical ISAC Systems under Ship Attitude Variation
Authors: Kapila W. S. Palitharathna, Constantinos Psomas, Ioannis Krikidis
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a lightwave power transfer-enabled underwater optical integrated sensing and communication (O-ISAC) system, where an access point (AP) mounted on a seasurface ship transmits lightwave signals to two nodes, namely ($i$) a seabed sensor that harvests energy and transmits uplink information to the AP, and ($ii$) a sensing target whose position is estimated by the AP using an array of pinhole cameras. To capture practical deployment conditions, the ship attitude variation is modeled through its roll, pitch, and yaw angles, each following a Gaussian distribution under low-to-moderate sea states. Closed-form approximations are derived for the mean squared error (MSE) of target localization and the achievable uplink data rate. Analytical and simulation results demonstrate excellent agreement, validating the proposed models and derived expressions, while revealing the fundamental communication-sensing tradeoff in the O-ISAC system. The results further provide valuable design insights, including the optimal camera placement on the ship to minimize localization error, achieving a minimum MSE of $10^{-2}$ $\text{m}^2$ with multiple cameras under roll, pitch, and yaw angle variation of $10^{\circ}$, and the optimal harvest-use ratio of $0.55$ for the considered setup.

Title: Computational Imaging Meets LLMs: Zero-Shot IDH Mutation Prediction in Brain Gliomas
Authors: Syed Muqeem Mahmood, Hassan Mohy-ud-Din
Abstract: We present a framework that combines Large Language Models with computational image analytics for non-invasive, zero-shot prediction of IDH mutation status in brain gliomas. For each subject, coregistered multi-parametric MRI scans and multi-class tumor segmentation maps were processed to extract interpretable semantic (visual) attributes and quantitative features, serialized in a standardized JSON file, and used to query GPT 4o and GPT 5 without fine-tuning. We evaluated this framework on six publicly available datasets (N = 1427) and results showcased high accuracy and balanced classification performance across heterogeneous cohorts, even in the absence of manual annotations. GPT 5 outperformed GPT 4o in context-driven phenotype interpretation. Volumetric features emerged as the most important predictors, supplemented by subtype-specific imaging markers and clinical information. Our results demonstrate the potential of integrating LLM-based reasoning with computational image analytics for precise, non-invasive tumor genotyping, advancing diagnostic strategies in neuro-oncology.

Title: A Digital Twin of Evaporative Thermo-Fluidic Process in Fixation Unit of DoD Inkjet Printers
Authors: Samarth Toolhally, Joeri Roelofs, Siep Weiland, Amritam Das
Abstract: In inkjet printing, optimal paper moisture is crucial for print quality, achieved through hot-air impingement in the fixation unit. This paper presents a modular digital twin of the fixation unit, modeling the thermo-fluidic drying process and monitoring its spatio-temporal performance. The novel approach formulates the digital twin as an infinite-dimensional state estimator that infers fixation states from limited sensor data, while remaining robust to disturbances. Modularity is achieved through a graph-theoretic model, where each node represents thermo-fluidic dynamics in different sections of the fixation unit. Evaporation is modeled as a nonlinear boundary effect coupled with node dynamics via Linear Fractional Representation. Using the Partial Integral Equation (PIE) framework, we develop a unified approach for stability, input-output analysis, simulation, and rapid prototyping, validated with operational data from a commercial printer. An $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$-optimal Luenberger state estimator is then synthesized to estimate thermal states from available sensor data, enabling real-time monitoring of spatio-temporal thermal effects on paper sheets.

Title: Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Dynamic Sub-Networks with Missing Data
Authors: João Victor Galvão da Mata, Anders Hansson, Martin S. Andersen
Abstract: Maximum likelihood estimation is effective for identifying dynamical systems, but applying it to large networks becomes computationally prohibitive. This paper introduces a maximum likelihood estimation method that enables identification of sub-networks within complex interconnected systems without estimating the entire network. The key insight is that under specific topological conditions, a sub-network's parameters can be estimated using only local measurements: signals within the target sub-network and those in the directly connected to the so-called separator sub-network. This approach significantly reduces computational complexity while enhancing privacy by eliminating the need to share sensitive internal data across organizational boundaries. We establish theoretical conditions for network separability, derive the probability density function for the sub-network, and demonstrate the method's effectiveness through numerical examples.

Title: Performance Analysis of Wireless-Powered Pinching Antenna Systems
Authors: Kunrui Cao, Jingyu Chen, Panagiotis D. Diamantoulakis, Lei Zhou, Xingwang Li, Yuanwei Liu, George K. Karagiannidis
Abstract: Pinching antenna system (PAS) serves as a groundbreaking paradigm that enhances wireless communications by flexibly adjusting the position of pinching antenna (PA) and establishing a strong line-of-sight (LoS) link, thereby reducing the free-space path loss. This paper introduces the concept of wireless-powered PAS, and investigates the reliability of wireless-powered PAS to explore the advantages of PA in improving the performance of wireless-powered communication (WPC) system. In addition, we derive the closed-form expressions of outage probability and ergodic rate for the practical lossy waveguide case and ideal lossless waveguide case, respectively, and analyze the optimal deployment of waveguides and user to provide valuable insights for guiding their deployments. The results show that an increase in the absorption coefficient and in the dimensions of the user area leads to higher in-waveguide and free-space propagation losses, respectively, which in turn increase the outage probability and reduce the ergodic rate of the wireless-powered PAS. However, the performance of wireless-powered PAS is severely affected by the absorption coefficient and the waveguide length, e.g., under conditions of high absorption coefficient and long waveguide, the outage probability of wireless-powered PAS is even worse than that of traditional WPC system. While the ergodic rate of wireless-powered PAS is better than that of traditional WPC system under conditions of high absorption coefficient and long waveguide. Interestingly, the wireless-powered PAS has the optimal time allocation factor and optimal distance between power station (PS) and access point (AP) to minimize the outage probability or maximize the ergodic rate. Moreover, the system performance of PS and AP separated at the optimal distance between PS and AP is superior to that of PS and AP integrated into a hybrid access point.

Title: An Alternative Derivation and Optimal Design Method of the Generalized Bilinear Transformation for Discretizing Analog Systems
Authors: Shen Chen, Yanlong Li, Jiamin Cui, Wei Yao, Jisong Wang, Yixin Tian, Chaohou Liu, Yang Yang, Jiaxi Ying, Zeng Liu, Jinjun Liu
Abstract: A popular method for designing digital systems is transforming the transfer function of the corresponding analog systems from the continuous-time domain (s-domain) into the discrete-time domain (z-domain) using the Euler or Tustin method. We demonstrate that these transformations are two specific forms of the Generalized Bilinear Transformation (GBT) with a design parameter, $\alpha$. However, the physical meaning and optimal design method for this parameter are not sufficiently studied. In this paper, we propose an alternative derivation of the GBT derived by employing a new hexagonal shape to approximate the enclosed area of the error function, and we define the parameter $\alpha$ as the shape factor. The physical meaning of the shape factor is firstly revealed, which equals to the percentage of the backward rectangular ratio of the proposed hexagonal shape. We demonstrate that the stable range of the shape factor is [0.5, 1] through domain mapping. Depending on the operating frequencies and the shape factor, we observe two distinct distortion modes, i.e., the magnitude and phase distortion. We proceed to develop an optimal design method for the shape factor based on an objective function in form of the normalized magnitude or phase error. Finally, a low-pass filter (LPF) is designed and tested to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing the theoretical calculations with the experimental results.

Title: Seeing What You Say: Expressive Image Generation from Speech
Authors: Jiyoung Lee, Song Park, Sanghyuk Chun, Soo-Whan Chung
Abstract: This paper proposes VoxStudio, the first unified and end-to-end speech-to-image model that generates expressive images directly from spoken descriptions by jointly aligning linguistic and paralinguistic information. At its core is a speech information bottleneck (SIB) module, which compresses raw speech into compact semantic tokens, preserving prosody and emotional nuance. By operating directly on these tokens, VoxStudio eliminates the need for an additional speech-to-text system, which often ignores the hidden details beyond text, e.g., tone or emotion. We also release VoxEmoset, a large-scale paired emotional speech-image dataset built via an advanced TTS engine to affordably generate richly expressive utterances. Comprehensive experiments on the SpokenCOCO, Flickr8kAudio, and VoxEmoset benchmarks demonstrate the feasibility of our method and highlight key challenges, including emotional consistency and linguistic ambiguity, paving the way for future research.

Title: A Modified Pulse and Design Framework to Halve the Complexity of OFDM Spectral Shaping Techniques
Authors: Javier Giménez, José A. Cortés, Francisco Javier Cañete, Eduardo Martos-Naya, Luis Díez
Abstract: Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a widespread modulation but suffers from high out-of-band emissions (OOBE). Spectral shaping strategies such as precoding, active interference cancellation (AIC) and time-domain methods are effective at reducing the OOBE but entail optimization procedures and real-time implementation costs which might be considerable. This letter proposes a modification of the conventional OFDM waveform aimed at reducing the cost associated to many of the state-of-theart spectral shaping techniques and sets a framework for future works that want to benefit from the same reduction. This approach may reduce both the number of coefficients involved in the optimization and the number of products of its implementation by up to 50%.

Title: System Identification of a Moored ASV with Recessed Moon Pool via Deterministic and Bayesian Hankel-DMDc
Authors: Giorgio Palma, Ivan Santic, Andrea Serani, Lorenzo Minno, Matteo Diez
Abstract: This study addresses the system identification of a small autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) under moored conditions using Hankel dynamic mode decomposition with control (HDMDc) and its Bayesian extension (BHDMDc). Experiments were carried out on a Codevintec CK-14e ASV in the towing tank of CNR-INM, under both irregular and regular head-sea wave conditions. The ASV under investigation features a recessed moon pool, which induces nonlinear responses due to sloshing, thereby increasing the modelling challenge. Data-driven reduced-order models were built from measurements of vessel motions and mooring loads. The HDMDc framework provided accurate deterministic predictions of vessel dynamics, while the Bayesian formulation enabled uncertainty-aware characterization of the model response by accounting for variability in hyperparameter selection. Validation against experimental data demonstrated that both HDMDc and BHDMDc can predict the vessel's response to unseen regular and irregular wave excitations. In conclusion, the study shows that HDMDc-based ROMs are a viable data-driven alternative for system identification, demonstrating for the first time their generalization capability for a sea condition different from the training set, achieving high accuracy in reproducing vessel dynamics.

Title: A Novel Multi-Reference-Point Modeling Framework for Monostatic Background Channel: Toward 3GPP ISAC Standardization
Authors: Yameng Liu, Jianhua Zhang, Yuxiang Zhang, Zhiqiang Yuan, Chuangxin Jiang, Junchen Liu, Wei Hong, Yingyang Li, Yan Li, Guangyi Liu
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) has been identified as a key 6G application by ITU and 3GPP. A realistic, standard-compatible channel model is essential for ISAC system design. To characterize the impact of Sensing Targets (STs), 3GPP defines ISAC channel as a combination of target and background channels, comprising multipath components related to STs and those originating solely from the environment, respectively. Although the background channel does not carry direct ST information, its accurate modeling is critical for evaluating sensing performance, especially in complex environments. Existing communication standards characterize propagation between separated transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx). However, modeling background channels in the ISAC monostatic mode, where the Tx and Rx are co-located, remains a pressing challenge. In this paper, we firstly conduct ISAC monostatic background channel measurements for an indoor scenario at 28 GHz. Realistic channel parameters are extracted, revealing pronounced single-hop propagation and discrete multipath distribution. Inspired by these properties, a novel stochastic model is proposed to characterizing the ISAC monostatic background channel as the superposition of sub-channels between the monostatic Tx&Rx and multiple communication Rx-like Reference Points (RPs). This model is compatible with standardizations, and a 3GPP-extended implementation framework is introduced. Finally, a genetic algorithm-based method is proposed to extract the optimal number and placement of multi-RPs. The optimization approach and modeling framework are validated by comparing measured and simulated channel parameters. Results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively captures monostatic background channel characteristics, addresses a critical gap in ISAC channel modeling, and supports 6G standardization.

Title: Data-driven Modeling of Grid-following Control in Grid-connected Converters
Authors: Amir Bahador Javadi, Philip Pong
Abstract: As power systems evolve with the integration of renewable energy sources and the implementation of smart grid technologies, there is an increasing need for flexible and scalable modeling approaches capable of accurately capturing the complex dynamics of modern grids. To meet this need, various methods, such as the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics and deep symbolic regression, have been developed to identify dynamical systems directly from data. In this study, we examine the application of a converter-based resource as a replacement for a traditional generator within a lossless transmission line linked to an infinite bus system. This setup is used to generate synthetic data in grid-following control mode, enabling the evaluation of these methods in effectively capturing system dynamics.

Title: Artificial-reference tracking MPC with probabilistically validated performance on industrial embedded systems
Authors: Victor Gracia, Pablo Krupa, Filiberto Fele, Teodoro Alamo
Abstract: Industrial embedded systems are typically used to execute simple control algorithms due to their low computational resources. Despite these limitations, the implementation of advanced control techniques such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) has been explored by the control community in recent years, typically considering simple linear formulations or explicit ones to facilitate the online computation of the control input. These simplifications often lack features and properties that are desirable in real-world environments. In this article, we present an efficient implementation for embedded systems of MPC for tracking with artificial reference, solved via a recently developed structure-exploiting first-order method. This formulation is tailored to a wide range of applications by incorporating essential practical features at a small computational cost, including integration with an offset-free scheme, back-off parameters that enable constraint tightening, and soft constraints that preserve feasibility under disturbances or plant-model mismatch. We accompany this with a framework for probabilistic performance validation of the closed-loop system over long-term operation. We illustrate the applicability of the approach on a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), incorporated in a hardware-in-the-loop setup to control a nonlinear continuous stirred-tank reactor. The behavior of the closed-loop system is probabilistically validated with respect to constraint violations and the number of iterations required at each time step by the MPC optimization algorithm.

Title: 3D Cooperative User Tracking for Distributed Integrated Sensing and Communication
Authors: Yingjie Xu, Xuesong Cai, Michiel Sandra, Sara Willhammar, Fredrik Tufvesson
Abstract: As integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) becomes an integral part of 6G networks, distributed ISAC (DISAC) is expected to enhance both sensing and communication performance through its decentralized architecture. This paper presents a complete framework to address the challenge of cooperative user tracking in DISAC systems. By incorporating a global probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter and a field-of-view-aware access point (AP) management strategy, the framework enables accurate user tracking using radio signals while optimizing AP scheduling. In addition, a real-world distributed MIMO channel measurement campaign is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the framework. The results demonstrate that a centimeter-level root mean-square trajectory error can be achieved. Furthermore, the results show that it is not necessary to keep APs active at all times to maintain high tracking accuracy, indicating the need for robust and efficient AP management. These findings provide valuable insight into practical deployments and further development of cooperative user tracking techniques in DISAC systems.

Title: A Constant-Gain Equation-Error Framework for Airliner Aerodynamic Monitoring Using QAR Data
Authors: Ruiying Wen, Yuntao Dai, Hongyong Wang
Abstract: Monitoring the in-service aerodynamic performance of airliners is critical for operational efficiency and safety, but using operational Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data for this purpose presents significant challenges. This paper first establishes that the absence of key parameters, particularly aircraft moments of inertia, makes conventional state-propagation filters fundamentally unsuitable for this application. This limitation necessitates a decoupled, Equation-Error Method (EEM). However, we then demonstrate through a comparative analysis that standard recursive estimators with time-varying gains, such as Recursive Least Squares (RLS), also fail within an EEM framework, exhibiting premature convergence or instability when applied to low-excitation cruise data. To overcome these dual challenges, we propose and validate the Constant-Gain Equation-Error Method (CG-EEM). This framework employs a custom estimator with a constant, Kalman-like gain, which is perfectly suited to the stationary, low-signal-to-noise characteristics of cruise flight. The CG-EEM is extensively validated on a large, multi-fleet dataset of over 200 flights, where it produces highly consistent, physically plausible aerodynamic parameters and correctly identifies known performance differences between aircraft types. The result is a robust, scalable, and computationally efficient tool for fleet-wide performance monitoring and the early detection of performance degradation.

Title: Toward an Agricultural Operational Design Domain: A Framework
Authors: Mirco Felske, Jannik Redenius, Georg Happich, Julius Schöning
Abstract: The agricultural sector increasingly relies on autonomous systems that operate in complex and variable environments. Unlike on-road applications, agricultural automation integrates driving and working processes, each of which imposes distinct operational constraints. Handling this complexity and ensuring consistency throughout the development and validation processes requires a structured, transparent, and verified description of the environment. However, existing Operational Design Domain (ODD) concepts do not yet address the unique challenges of agricultural applications. Therefore, this work introduces the Agricultural ODD (Ag-ODD) Framework, which can be used to describe and verify the operational boundaries of autonomous agricultural systems. The Ag-ODD Framework consists of three core elements. First, the Ag-ODD description concept, which provides a structured method for unambiguously defining environmental and operational parameters using concepts from ASAM Open ODD and CityGML. Second, the 7-Layer Model derived from the PEGASUS 6-Layer Model, has been extended to include a process layer to capture dynamic agricultural operations. Third, the iterative verification process verifies the Ag-ODD against its corresponding logical scenarios, derived from the 7-Layer Model, to ensure the Ag-ODD's completeness and consistency. Together, these elements provide a consistent approach for creating unambiguous and verifiable Ag-ODD. Demonstrative use cases show how the Ag-ODD Framework can support the standardization and scalability of environmental descriptions for autonomous agricultural systems.

Title: Digital Twin-Driven Pavement Health Monitoring and Maintenance Optimization Using Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Mohsin Mahmud Topu, Mahfuz Ahmed Anik, Azmine Toushik Wasi, Md Manjurul Ahsan
Abstract: Pavement infrastructure monitoring is challenged by complex spatial dependencies, changing environmental conditions, and non-linear deterioration across road networks. Traditional Pavement Management Systems (PMS) remain largely reactive, lacking real-time intelligence for failure prevention and optimal maintenance planning. To address this, we propose a unified Digital Twin (DT) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for scalable, data-driven pavement health monitoring and predictive maintenance. Pavement segments and spatial relations are modeled as graph nodes and edges, while real-time UAV, sensor, and LiDAR data stream into the DT. The inductive GNN learns deterioration patterns from graph-structured inputs to forecast distress and enable proactive interventions. Trained on a real-world-inspired dataset with segment attributes and dynamic connectivity, our model achieves an R2 of 0.3798, outperforming baseline regressors and effectively capturing non-linear degradation. We also develop an interactive dashboard and reinforcement learning module for simulation, visualization, and adaptive maintenance planning. This DT-GNN integration enhances forecasting precision and establishes a closed feedback loop for continuous improvement, positioning the approach as a foundation for proactive, intelligent, and sustainable pavement management, with future extensions toward real-world deployment, multi-agent coordination, and smart-city integration.

Title: PrivyWave: Privacy-Aware Wireless Sensing of Heartbeat
Authors: Yixuan Gao, Tanvir Ahmed, Zekun Chang, Thijs Roumen, Rajalakshmi Nandakumar
Abstract: Wireless sensing technologies can now detect heartbeats using radio frequency and acoustic signals, raising significant privacy concerns. Existing privacy solutions either protect from all sensing systems indiscriminately preventing any utility or operate post-data collection, failing to enable selective access where authorized devices can monitor while unauthorized ones cannot. We present a key-based physical obfuscation system, PrivyWave, that addresses this challenge by generating controlled decoy heartbeat signals at cryptographically-determined frequencies. Unauthorized sensors receive a mixture of real and decoy signals that are indistinguishable without the secret key, while authorized sensors use the key to filter out decoys and recover accurate measurements. Our evaluation with 13 participants demonstrates effective protection across both sensing modalities: for mmWave radar, unauthorized sensors show 21.3 BPM mean absolute error while authorized sensors maintain a much smaller 5.8 BPM; for acoustic sensing, unauthorized error increases to 42.0 BPM while authorized sensors achieve 9.7 BPM. The system operates across multiple sensing modalities without per-modality customization and provides cryptographic obfuscation guarantees. Performance benchmarks show robust protection across different distances (30-150 cm), orientations (120° field of view), and diverse indoor environments, establishing physical-layer obfuscation as a viable approach for selective privacy in pervasive health monitoring.

Title: Observer-based neural networks for flow estimation and control
Authors: Tarcísio C. Déda, William R. Wolf, Scott T. M. Dawson, Brener L. O. Ramos
Abstract: Neural network observers (NNOs) are proposed for real-time estimation of fluid flows, addressing a key challenge in flow control: obtaining real-time flow states from a limited set of sparse and noisy sensor data. For this task, we propose a generalization of the classical Luenberger observer. In the present framework, the estimation loop is composed of subsystems modeled as neural networks (NNs). By combining flow information from selected probes and an NN surrogate model (NNSM) of the flow system, we train NNOs capable of fusing information to provide the best estimation of the states, that can in turn be fed back to an NN controller (NNC). The NNO capabilities are demonstrated for three nonlinear dynamical systems. First, a variation of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation with control inputs is studied, where variables are sparsely probed. We show that the NNO is able to track states even when probes are contaminated with random noise or with sensors at insufficient sample rates to match the control time step. Then, a confined cylinder flow is investigated, where velocity signals along the cylinder wake are estimated by using a small set of wall pressure sensors. In both the KS and cylinder problems, we show that the estimated states can be used to enable closed-loop control, taking advantage of stabilizing NNCs. Finally, we present a legacy dataset of a turbulent boundary layer experiment, where convolutional NNs (CNNs) are employed to implement the models required for the estimation loop. We show that, by combining low-resolution noise-corrupted sensor data with an imperfect NNSM, it is possible to produce more accurate estimates, outperforming both the direct reconstructions via specialized super-resolution NNs and the direct model propagation from initial conditions.

Title: Distributed Incast Detection in Data Center Networks
Authors: Yiming Zheng, Haoran Qi, Lirui Yu, Zhan Shu, Qing Zhao
Abstract: Incast traffic in data centers can lead to severe performance degradation, such as packet loss and increased latency. Effectively addressing incast requires prompt and accurate detection. Existing solutions, including MA-ECN, BurstRadar and Pulser, typically rely on fixed thresholds of switch port egress queue lengths or their gradients to identify microburst caused by incast flows. However, these queue length related methods often suffer from delayed detection and high error rates. In this study, we propose a distributed incast detection method for data center networks at the switch-level, leveraging a probabilistic hypothesis test with an optimal detection threshold. By analyzing the arrival intervals of new flows, our algorithm can immediately determine if a flow is part of an incast traffic from its initial packet. The experimental results demonstrate that our method offers significant improvements over existing approaches in both detection speed and inference accuracy.

Title: A Computational Approach to Analyzing Disrupted Language in Schizophrenia: Integrating Surprisal and Coherence Measures
Authors: Gowtham Premananth, Carol Espy-Wilson
Abstract: Language disruptions are one of the well-known effects of schizophrenia symptoms. They are often manifested as disorganized speech and impaired discourse coherence. These abnormalities in spontaneous language production reflect underlying cognitive disturbances and have the potential to serve as objective markers for symptom severity and diagnosis of schizophrenia. This study focuses on how these language disruptions can be characterized in terms of two computational linguistic measures: surprisal and semantic coherence. By computing surprisal and semantic coherence of language using computational models, this study investigates how they differ between subjects with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Furthermore, this study provides further insight into how language disruptions in terms of these linguistic measures change with varying degrees of schizophrenia symptom severity.

Title: ISC-Perception: A Hybrid Computer Vision Dataset for Object Detection in Novel Steel Assembly
Authors: Miftahur Rahman, Samuel Adebayo, Dorian A. Acevedo-Mejia, David Hester, Daniel McPolin, Karen Rafferty, Debra F. Laefer
Abstract: The Intermeshed Steel Connection (ISC) system, when paired with robotic manipulators, can accelerate steel-frame assembly and improve worker safety by eliminating manual assembly. Dependable perception is one of the initial stages for ISC-aware robots. However, this is hampered by the absence of a dedicated image corpus, as collecting photographs on active construction sites is logistically difficult and raises safety and privacy concerns. In response, we introduce ISC-Perception, the first hybrid dataset expressly designed for ISC component detection. It blends procedurally rendered CAD images, game-engine photorealistic scenes, and a limited, curated set of real photographs, enabling fully automatic labelling of the synthetic portion. We explicitly account for all human effort to produce the dataset, including simulation engine and scene setup, asset preparation, post-processing scripts and quality checks; our total human time to generate a 10,000-image dataset was 30.5,h versus 166.7,h for manual labelling at 60,s per image (-81.7%). A manual pilot on a representative image with five instances of ISC members took 60,s (maximum 80,s), anchoring the manual baseline. Detectors trained on ISC-Perception achieved a mean Average Precision at IoU 0.50 of 0.756, substantially surpassing models trained on synthetic-only or photorealistic-only data. On a 1,200-frame bench test, we report mAP@0.50/mAP@[0.50:0.95] of 0.943/0.823. By bridging the data gap for construction-robotics perception, ISC-Perception facilitates rapid development of custom object detectors and is freely available for research and industrial use upon request.

Title: D2-UC: A Distributed-Distributed Quantum-Classical Framework for Unit Commitment
Authors: Milad Hasanzadeh, Amin Kargarian
Abstract: This paper introduces D2-UC, a quantum-ready framework for the unit commitment (UC) problem that prepares UC for near-term hybrid quantum-classical solvers by combining distributed classical decomposition with distributed quantum execution. We reformulate deterministic and stochastic UC into a three-block alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM): (i) a convex quadratic subproblem for dispatch and reserves, (ii) a binary subproblem expressed as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), and (iii) a proximal slack update for consensus. The core contributions are fivefold. First, we demonstrate how the full UC problem can be expressed as a single monolithic QUBO, establishing a direct interface to quantum solvers. Second, we decompose this large binary block into three type-specific QUBOs for commitment, startup, and shutdown, making the problem more tractable but revealing slower ADMM convergence. Third, we restore local logical couplings through per-unit-time micro-QUBOs, which accelerate convergence. Fourth, we batch micro-QUBOs into K non-overlapping block-diagonal problems, reducing many subproblems to a fixed number of solver-ready QUBOs per iteration, compatible with distributed variational quantum eigensolvers (DVQE). Fifth, we integrate an accept-if-better safeguard with DVQE to stabilize hybrid updates and prevent oscillations. Case studies confirm that the proposed methods deliver feasible schedules, faster convergence, and QUBO sizes aligned with current and near-term quantum hardware capabilities.

Title: Control Barrier Function for Aligning Large Language Models
Authors: Yuya Miyaoka, Masaki Inoue
Abstract: This paper proposes a control-based framework for aligning large language models (LLMs) by leveraging a control barrier function (CBF) to ensure user-desirable text generation. The presented framework applies the CBF safety filter to the predicted token generated from the baseline LLM, to intervene in the generated text. The safety filter includes two significant advantages: this safety filter is an add-on type, allowing it to be used for alignment purposes without fine-tuning the baseline LLM, and if there is an evaluation model regarding the desired alignment, it can be directly applied to the filter design. The overall text-generation system is implemented with open-source language models, aiming to generate positive text.

Title: Frequency- and Amplitude-Modulated Gates for Universal Quantum Control
Authors: Qi Ding, Shoumik Chowdhury, Agustin Di Paolo, Réouven Assouly, Alan V. Oppenheim, Jeffrey A. Grover, William D. Oliver
Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates is essential for executing arbitrary digital quantum algorithms and for building error-corrected quantum computers. We propose a theoretical framework for implementing quantum gates using frequency- and amplitude-modulated microwave control, which extends conventional amplitude modulation by introducing frequency modulation as an additional degree of control. Our approach operates on fixed-frequency qubits, converting the need for qubit frequency tunability into drive frequency modulation. Using Floquet theory, we analyze and design these drives for optimal fidelity within specified criteria. Our framework spans adiabatic to nonadiabatic gates within the Floquet framework, ensuring broad applicability across gate types and control schemes. Using typical transmon qubit parameters in numerical simulations, we demonstrate a universal gate set-including the X, Hadamard, phase, and CZ gates-with control error well below 0.1% and gate times of 25-40 ns for single-qubit operations and 125-135 ns for two-qubit operations. Furthermore, we show an always-on CZ gate tailored for driven qubits, which has gate times of 80-90 ns.

Title: Collaborative Assembly Policy Learning of a Sightless Robot
Authors: Zeqing Zhang, Weifeng Lu, Lei Yang, Wei Jing, Bowei Tang, Jia Pan
Abstract: This paper explores a physical human-robot collaboration (pHRC) task involving the joint insertion of a board into a frame by a sightless robot and a human operator. While admittance control is commonly used in pHRC tasks, it can be challenging to measure the force/torque applied by the human for accurate human intent estimation, limiting the robot's ability to assist in the collaborative task. Other methods that attempt to solve pHRC tasks using reinforcement learning (RL) are also unsuitable for the board-insertion task due to its safety constraints and sparse rewards. Therefore, we propose a novel RL approach that utilizes a human-designed admittance controller to facilitate more active robot behavior and reduce human effort. Through simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms admittance control in terms of success rate and task completion time. Additionally, we observed a significant reduction in measured force/torque when using our proposed approach compared to admittance control.

Title: FAPEX: Fractional Amplitude-Phase Expressor for Robust Cross-Subject Seizure Prediction
Authors: Ruizhe Zheng, Lingyan Mao, Dingding Han, Tian Luo, Yi Wang, Jing Ding, Yuguo Yu
Abstract: Precise, generalizable subject-agnostic seizure prediction (SASP) remains a fundamental challenge due to the intrinsic complexity and significant spectral variability of electrophysiological signals across individuals and recording modalities. We propose FAPEX, a novel architecture that introduces a learnable fractional neural frame operator (FrNFO) for adaptive time-frequency decomposition. Unlike conventional models that exhibit spectral bias toward low frequencies, our FrNFO employs fractional-order convolutions to capture both high and low-frequency dynamics, achieving approximately 10% improvement in F1-score and sensitivity over state-of-the-art baselines. The FrNFO enables the extraction of instantaneous phase and amplitude representations that are particularly informative for preictal biomarker discovery and enhance out-of-distribution generalization. FAPEX further integrates structural state-space modeling and channelwise attention, allowing it to handle heterogeneous electrode montages. Evaluated across 12 benchmarks spanning species (human, rat, dog, macaque) and modalities (Scalp-EEG, SEEG, ECoG, LFP), FAPEX consistently outperforms 23 supervised and 10 self-supervised baselines under nested cross-validation, with gains of up to 15% in sensitivity on complex cross-domain scenarios. It further demonstrates superior performance in several external validation cohorts. To our knowledge, these establish FAPEX as the first epilepsy model to show consistent superiority in SASP, offering a promising solution for discovering epileptic biomarker evidence supporting the existence of a distinct and identifiable preictal state and clinical translation.

Title: Computing the nearest $Ω$-admissible descriptor dissipative Hamiltonian system
Authors: Vaishali Aggarwal, Nicolas Gillis, Punit Sharma
Abstract: For a given set $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{C}$, a matrix pair $(E,A)$ is called $\Omega$-admissible if it is regular, impulse-free and its eigenvalues lie inside the region $\Omega$. In this paper, we provide a dissipative Hamiltonian characterization for the matrix pairs that are $\Omega$-admissible where $\Omega$ is an LMI region. We then use these results for solving the nearest $\Omega$-admissible matrix pair problem: Given a matrix pair $(E,A)$, find the nearest $\Omega$-admissible pair $(\tilde E, \tilde A)$ to the given pair $(E,A)$. We illustrate our results on several data sets and compare with the state of the art.

Title: Explicit Ensemble Learning Surrogate for Joint Chance-Constrained Optimal Power Flow
Authors: Amir Bahador Javadi, Amin Kargarian
Abstract: The increasing penetration of renewable generation introduces uncertainty into power systems, challenging traditional deterministic optimization methods. Chance-constrained optimization offers an approach to balancing cost and risk; however, incorporating joint chance constraints introduces computational challenges. This paper presents an ensemble support vector machine surrogate for joint chance constraint optimal power flow, where multiple linear classifiers are trained on simulated optimal power flow data and embedded as tractable hyperplane constraints via Big--M reformulations. The surrogate yields a polyhedral approximation of probabilistic line flow limits that preserves interpretability and scalability. Numerical experiments on the IEEE 118-bus system show that the proposed method achieves near-optimal costs with a negligible average error of $0.03\%$. These results demonstrate the promise of ensemble surrogates as efficient and transparent tools for risk-aware optimization of power systems.

Title: OneOcc: Semantic Occupancy Prediction for Legged Robots with a Single Panoramic Camera
Authors: Hao Shi, Ze Wang, Shangwei Guo, Mengfei Duan, Song Wang, Teng Chen, Kailun Yang, Lin Wang, Kaiwei Wang
Abstract: Robust 3D semantic occupancy is crucial for legged/humanoid robots, yet most semantic scene completion (SSC) systems target wheeled platforms with forward-facing sensors. We present OneOcc, a vision-only panoramic SSC framework designed for gait-introduced body jitter and 360° continuity. OneOcc combines: (i) Dual-Projection fusion (DP-ER) to exploit the annular panorama and its equirectangular unfolding, preserving 360° continuity and grid alignment; (ii) Bi-Grid Voxelization (BGV) to reason in Cartesian and cylindrical-polar spaces, reducing discretization bias and sharpening free/occupied boundaries; (iii) a lightweight decoder with Hierarchical AMoE-3D for dynamic multi-scale fusion and better long-range/occlusion reasoning; and (iv) plug-and-play Gait Displacement Compensation (GDC) learning feature-level motion correction without extra sensors. We also release two panoramic occupancy benchmarks: QuadOcc (real quadruped, first-person 360°) and Human360Occ (H3O) (CARLA human-ego 360° with RGB, Depth, semantic occupancy; standardized within-/cross-city splits). OneOcc sets new state-of-the-art (SOTA): on QuadOcc it beats strong vision baselines and popular LiDAR ones; on H3O it gains +3.83 mIoU (within-city) and +8.08 (cross-city). Modules are lightweight, enabling deployable full-surround perception for legged/humanoid robots. Datasets and code will be publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Exploiting Over-Approximation Errors as Preview Information for Nonlinear Control
Authors: Antoine Aspeel, Antoine Girard, Thiago Alves Lima
Abstract: We study the control of nonlinear constrained systems via over-approximations. Our key observation is that the over-approximation error, rather than being an unknown disturbance, can be exploited as input-dependent preview information. This leads to the notion of informed policies, which depend on both the state and the error. We formulate the concretization problem -recovering a valid input for the true system from a preview-based policy- as a fixed-point equation. Existence of solutions follows from the Brouwer fixed-point theorem, while efficient computation is enabled through closed-form, linear, or convex programs for input-affine systems, and through an iterative method based on the Banach fixed-point theorem for nonlinear systems.

Title: Manifold-constrained Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Learning for Decentralized Multi-Agent Motion Planning
Authors: Qingyi Chen, Ruiqi Ni, Jun Kim, Ahmed H. Qureshi
Abstract: Safe multi-agent motion planning (MAMP) under task-induced constraints is a critical challenge in robotics. Many real-world scenarios require robots to navigate dynamic environments while adhering to manifold constraints imposed by tasks. For example, service robots must carry cups upright while avoiding collisions with humans or other robots. Despite recent advances in decentralized MAMP for high-dimensional systems, incorporating manifold constraints remains difficult. To address this, we propose a manifold-constrained Hamilton-Jacobi reachability (HJR) learning framework for decentralized MAMP. Our method solves HJR problems under manifold constraints to capture task-aware safety conditions, which are then integrated into a decentralized trajectory optimization planner. This enables robots to generate motion plans that are both safe and task-feasible without requiring assumptions about other agents' policies. Our approach generalizes across diverse manifold-constrained tasks and scales effectively to high-dimensional multi-agent manipulation problems. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing constrained motion planners and operates at speeds suitable for real-world applications. Video demonstrations are available at this https URL .

Title: Tensor-Efficient High-Dimensional Q-learning
Authors: Junyi Wu, Dan Li
Abstract: High-dimensional reinforcement learning faces challenges with complex calculations and low sample efficiency in large state-action spaces. Q-learning algorithms struggle particularly with the curse of dimensionality, where the number of state-action pairs grows exponentially with problem size. While neural network-based approaches like Deep Q-Networks have shown success, recent tensor-based methods using low-rank decomposition offer more parameter-efficient alternatives. Building upon existing tensor-based methods, we propose Tensor-Efficient Q-Learning (TEQL), which enhances low-rank tensor decomposition via improved block coordinate descent on discretized state-action spaces, incorporating novel exploration and regularization mechanisms. The key innovation is an exploration strategy that combines approximation error with visit count-based upper confidence bound to prioritize actions with high uncertainty, avoiding wasteful random exploration. Additionally, we incorporate a frequency-based penalty term in the objective function to encourage exploration of less-visited state-action pairs and reduce overfitting to frequently visited regions. Empirical results on classic control tasks demonstrate that TEQL outperforms conventional matrix-based methods and deep RL approaches in both sample efficiency and total rewards, making it suitable for resource-constrained applications, such as space and healthcare where sampling costs are high.

Abstract: We present Step-Audio-EditX, the first open-source LLM-based audio model excelling at expressive and iterative audio editing encompassing emotion, speaking style, and paralinguistics alongside robust zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) this http URL core innovation lies in leveraging only large-margin synthetic data, which circumvents the need for embedding-based priors or auxiliary modules. This large-margin learning approach enables both iterative control and high expressivity across voices, and represents a fundamental pivot from the conventional focus on representation-level disentanglement. Evaluation results demonstrate that Step-Audio-EditX surpasses both MiniMax-2.6-hd and Doubao-Seed-TTS-2.0 in emotion editing and other fine-grained control tasks.

Title: Neural Beamforming with Doppler-Aware Sparse Attention for High Mobility Environments
Authors: Cemil Vahapoglu, Timothy J. O'Shea, Wan Liu, Sennur Ulukus
Abstract: Beamforming has significance for enhancing spectral efficiency and mitigating interference in multi-antenna wireless systems, facilitating spatial multiplexing and diversity in dense and high mobility scenarios. Traditional beamforming techniques such as zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) beamforming experience performance deterioration under adverse channel conditions. Deep learning-based beamforming offers an alternative with nonlinear mappings from channel state information (CSI) to beamforming weights by improving robustness against dynamic channel environments. Transformer-based models are particularly effective due to their ability to model long-range dependencies across time and frequency. However, their quadratic attention complexity limits scalability in large OFDM grids. Recent studies address this issue through sparse attention mechanisms that reduce complexity while maintaining expressiveness, yet often employ patterns that disregard channel dynamics, as they are not specifically designed for wireless communication scenarios. In this work, we propose a Doppler-aware Sparse Neural Network Beamforming (Doppler-aware Sparse NNBF) model that incorporates a channel-adaptive sparse attention mechanism in a multi-user single-input multiple-output (MU-SIMO) setting. The proposed sparsity structure is configurable along 2D time-frequency axes based on channel dynamics and is theoretically proven to ensure full connectivity within p hops, where p is the number of attention heads. Simulation results under urban macro (UMa) channel conditions show that Doppler-aware Sparse NNBF significantly outperforms both a fixed-pattern baseline, referred to as Standard Sparse NNBF, and conventional beamforming techniques ZFBF and MMSE beamforming in high mobility scenarios, while maintaining structured sparsity with a controlled number of attended keys per query.

Title: Geometrically robust least squares through manifold optimization
Authors: Jeremy Coulson, Alberto Padoan, Cyrus Mostajeran
Abstract: This paper presents a methodology for solving a geometrically robust least squares problem, which arises in various applications where the model is subject to geometric constraints. The problem is formulated as a minimax optimization problem on a product manifold, where one variable is constrained to a ball describing uncertainty. To handle the constraint, an exact penalty method is applied. A first-order gradient descent ascent algorithm is proposed to solve the problem, and its convergence properties are illustrated by an example. The proposed method offers a robust approach to solving a wide range of problems arising in signal processing and data-driven control.

Authors: Andrei A. Korigodskii, Oleg D. Kalachev, Artem E. Vasiunik, Matvei V. Urvantsev, Georgii E. Bondar
Abstract: This paper presents the innovative design and successful deployment of a pioneering autonomous unmanned aerial system developed for executing the world's largest mural painted by a drone. Addressing the dual challenges of maintaining artistic precision and operational reliability under adverse outdoor conditions such as wind and direct sunlight, our work introduces a robust system capable of navigating and painting outdoors with unprecedented accuracy. Key to our approach is a novel navigation system that combines an infrared (IR) motion capture camera and LiDAR technology, enabling precise location tracking tailored specifically for largescale artistic applications. We employ a unique control architecture that uses different regulation in tangential and normal directions relative to the planned path, enabling precise trajectory tracking and stable line rendering. We also present algorithms for trajectory planning and path optimization, allowing for complex curve drawing and area filling. The system includes a custom-designed paint spraying mechanism, specifically engineered to function effectively amidst the turbulent airflow generated by the drone's propellers, which also protects the drone's critical components from paint-related damage, ensuring longevity and consistent performance. Experimental results demonstrate the system's robustness and precision in varied conditions, showcasing its potential for autonomous large-scale art creation and expanding the functional applications of robotics in creative fields.

Title: MEDIC: Zero-shot Music Editing with Disentangled Inversion Control
Authors: Huadai Liu, Jialei Wang, Xiangtai Li, Wen Wang, Qian Chen, Rongjie Huang, Yang Liu, Jiayang Xu, Zhou Zhao
Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models revolutionize audio generation by adapting source audio to specific text prompts. However, existing zero-shot audio editing methods such as DDIM inversion accumulate errors across diffusion steps, reducing the effectiveness. Moreover, existing editing methods struggle with conducting complex non-rigid music edits while maintaining content integrity and high fidelity. To address these challenges, we propose MEDIC, a novel zero-shot music editing system based on innovative Disentangled Inversion Control (DIC) technique, which comprises Harmonized Attention Control and Disentangled Inversion. Disentangled Inversion disentangles the diffusion process into triple branches to rectify the deviated path of the source branch caused by DDIM inversion. Harmonized Attention Control unifies the mutual self-attention control and the cross-attention control with an intermediate Harmonic Branch to progressively generate the desired harmonic and melodic information in the target music. We also introduce ZoME-Bench, a comprehensive music editing benchmark with 1,100 samples covering ten distinct editing categories. ZoME-Bench facilitates both zero-shot and instruction-based music editing tasks. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art inversion techniques in editing fidelity and content preservation. The code and benchmark will be released. Audio samples are available at this https URL.

Title: Graph Sampling for Scalable and Expressive Graph Neural Networks on Homophilic Graphs
Authors: Haolin Li, Haoyu Wang, Luana Ruiz
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in many graph machine learning tasks but face challenges when scaling to large networks. GNN transferability allows training on smaller graphs and applying the model to larger ones, but existing methods often rely on random subsampling, leading to disconnected subgraphs and reduced model expressivity. We propose a novel graph sampling algorithm that leverages feature homophily to preserve graph structure. By minimizing the trace of the data correlation matrix, our method better preserves the graph Laplacian trace -- a proxy for the graph connectivity -- than random sampling, while achieving lower complexity than spectral methods. Experiments on citation networks show improved performance in preserving Laplacian trace and GNN transferability compared to random sampling.

Title: MAROON: A Framework for the Joint Characterization of Near-Field High-Resolution Radar and Optical Depth Imaging Techniques
Authors: Vanessa Wirth, Johanna Bräunig, Nikolai Hofmann, Martin Vossiek, Tim Weyrich, Marc Stamminger
Abstract: Utilizing the complementary strengths of wavelength-specific range or depth sensors is crucial for robust computer-assisted tasks such as autonomous driving. Despite this, there is still little research done at the intersection of optical depth sensors and radars operating close range, where the target is decimeters away from the sensors. Together with a growing interest in high-resolution imaging radars operating in the near field, the question arises how these sensors behave in comparison to their traditional optical counterparts. In this work, we take on the unique challenge of jointly characterizing depth imagers from both, the optical and radio-frequency domain using a multimodal spatial calibration. We collect data from four depth imagers, with three optical sensors of varying operation principle and an imaging radar. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of their depth measurements with respect to distinct object materials, geometries, and object-to-sensor distances. Specifically, we reveal scattering effects of partially transmissive materials and investigate the response of radio-frequency signals. All object measurements will be made public in form of a multimodal dataset, called MAROON.

Title: Alleviating Hyperparameter-Tuning Burden in SVM Classifiers for Pulmonary Nodules Diagnosis with Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization
Authors: Wenhao Chi, Haiping Liu, Hongqiao Dong, Wenhua Liang, Bo Liu
Abstract: In the field of non-invasive medical imaging, radiomic features are utilized to measure tumor characteristics. However, these features can be affected by the techniques used to discretize the images, ultimately impacting the accuracy of diagnosis. To investigate the influence of various image discretization methods on diagnosis, it is common practice to evaluate multiple discretization strategies individually. This approach often leads to redundant and time-consuming tasks such as training predictive models and fine-tuning hyperparameters separately. This study examines the feasibility of employing multi-task Bayesian optimization to accelerate the hyperparameters search for classifying benign and malignant pulmonary nodules using RBF SVM. Our findings suggest that multi-task Bayesian optimization significantly accelerates the search for hyperparameters in comparison to a single-task approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation to utilize multi-task Bayesian optimization in a critical medical context.

Title: NeurOp-Diff:Continuous Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution via Neural Operator Diffusion
Authors: Zihao Xu, Yuzhi Tang, Bowen Xu, Qingquan Li
Abstract: Most publicly accessible remote sensing data suffer from low resolution, limiting their practical applications. To address this, we propose a diffusion model guided by neural operators for continuous remote sensing image super-resolution (NeurOp-Diff). Neural operators are used to learn resolution representations at arbitrary scales, encoding low-resolution (LR) images into high-dimensional features, which are then used as prior conditions to guide the diffusion model for denoising. This effectively addresses the artifacts and excessive smoothing issues present in existing super-resolution (SR) methods, enabling the generation of high-quality, continuous super-resolution images. Specifically, we adjust the super-resolution scale by a scaling factor s, allowing the model to adapt to different super-resolution magnifications. Furthermore, experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of NeurOp-Diff. Our code is available at this https URL.

Title: Joint Positioning, Beamforming, and Power Allocation in Full-Duplex MIMO with Position-Reconfigurable Antenna Arrays
Authors: Chengjie Zhao, Yuanzhe Gong, Tho Le-Ngoc
Abstract: We consider a multi-user (MU) full-duplex (FD) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system, in which the base station transceiver is equipped with transmit and receive position reconfigurable antennas (PRAs) to mitigate both MU-interference (MUI) and self-interference (SI) while enhancing the desired signal quality. We first formulate a joint design of beamforming, transmit power allocation, and antenna placement to maximize the weighted sum-rate of the considered PRA-based MU-FD-MIMO system under the constraints on reconfigurable region size, minimum antenna spacing, and transmit power. To address this highly non-convex problem, we then propose an alternating optimization (AO) framework that decomposes the original problem into subproblems and solves them iteratively. In particular, fractional programming techniques are used to separate the optimization variables from the logarithmic and ratio terms, while the block successive upper bound minimization method handles the non-convexity of PRA placement. Simulation results confirm a significant performance gain when integrating PRAs into the MU-FD-MIMO system and demonstrate the advantage of the proposed optimization framework.

Title: Release Date Optimization in MRP Using Clearing Functions
Authors: Wolfgang Seiringer, Klaus Altendorfer, Reha Uzsoy
Abstract: This paper integrates a clearing function (CF)-based release planning approach into Material Requirements Planning (MRP) to address its limitations in modeling capacity constraints and dynamic lead times. The proposed optimization model replaces MRP's backward scheduling step while preserving its overall structure. Performance is evaluated through simulation experiments on two flow shop systems that explore a range of demand uncertainties and utilization levels. Computational results show that the proposed approach is capable of yielding significant improvements over the conventional backward scheduling approach, due to its ability to compute planned lead times for individual production orders as opposed to BOM items.

Title: Reactive power flow optimization in AC drive systems
Authors: Sanjay Chandrasekaran, Catalin Arghir, Pieder Joerg, Florian Doerfler, Silvia Mastellone
Abstract: This paper explores a limit avoidance approach in the case of input (modulation) and output (current) constraints with the aim of enhancing system availability of AC drives. Drawing on the observation that, in a certain range of reactive power, there exists a trade-off between current and modulation magnitude, we exploit this freedom and define a constrained optimization problem. We propose two approaches, one in the form of an activation-function which drives the reactive power set-point towards safety, and an approach which uses online feedback optimization to set the reactive power dynamically. Both methods compromise reactive power tracking accuracy for increased system robustness. Through a high fidelity simulation, we compare the benefits of the two methods, highlighting their effectiveness in industrial applications.

Title: Experimental Analysis of Multipath Characteristics in Indoor Distributed Massive MIMO Channels
Authors: Yingjie Xu, Xuesong Cai, Sara Willhammar, Fredrik Tufvesson
Abstract: Distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), also known as cell-free massive MIMO, has emerged as a promising technology for sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. This letter introduces an indoor channel measurement campaign designed to explore the behavior of multipath components (MPCs) in distributed MIMO channels. Fully coherent channels were measured between eight distributed uniform planar arrays (128 elements in total) and a 12-meter user equipment route. A method is introduced to determine the order (single- or multi-bounce) of MPC interaction by leveraging map information and MPC parameters. In addition, a Kalman filter-based framework is used for identifying the MPC interaction mechanisms (reflection or scattering/diffraction/mixed). Finally, a comprehensive MPC-level characterization is performed based on the measured channels, including the significance of single-bounce MPCs, common single-bounce MPCs, spherical wavefront features, birth-and-death processes of the MPCs, and spatial distribution of reflections. The findings serve as a valuable reference for understanding the propagation behavior of MPCs, which is necessary for future modeling of indoor distributed MIMO channels.

Abstract: An integration of satellites and terrestrial networks is crucial for enhancing performance of next generation communication systems. However, the networks are hindered by the long-distance path loss and security risks in dense urban environments. In this work, we propose a satellite-terrestrial covert communication system assisted by the aerial active simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (AASTAR-RIS) to improve the channel capacity while ensuring the transmission covertness. Specifically, we first derive the minimal detection error probability (DEP) under the worst condition that the Warden has perfect channel state information (CSI). Then, we formulate an AASTAR-RIS-assisted satellite-terrestrial covert communication optimization problem (ASCCOP) to maximize the sum of the fair channel capacity for all ground users while meeting the strict covert constraint, by jointly optimizing the trajectory and active beamforming of the AASTAR-RIS. Due to the challenges posed by the complex and high-dimensional state-action spaces as well as the need for efficient exploration in dynamic environments, we propose a generative deterministic policy gradient (GDPG) algorithm, which is a generative deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to solve the ASCCOP. Concretely, the generative diffusion model (GDM) is utilized as the policy representation of the algorithm to enhance the exploration process by generating diverse and high-quality samples through a series of denoising steps. Moreover, we incorporate an action gradient mechanism to accomplish the policy improvement of the algorithm, which refines the better state-action pairs through the gradient ascent. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms important benchmarks.

Title: Listen to Extract: Onset-Prompted Target Speaker Extraction
Authors: Pengjie Shen, Kangrui Chen, Shulin He, Pengru Chen, Shuqi Yuan, He Kong, Xueliang Zhang, Zhong-Qiu Wang
Abstract: We propose listen to extract (LExt), a highly-effective while extremely-simple algorithm for monaural target speaker extraction (TSE). Given an enrollment utterance of a target speaker, LExt aims at extracting the target speaker from the speaker's mixed speech with other speakers. For each mixture, LExt concatenates an enrollment utterance of the target speaker to the mixture signal at the waveform level, and trains deep neural networks (DNN) to extract the target speech based on the concatenated mixture signal. The rationale is that, this way, an artificial speech onset is created for the target speaker and it could prompt the DNN (a) which speaker is the target to extract; and (b) spectral-temporal patterns of the target speaker that could help extraction. This simple approach produces strong TSE performance on multiple public TSE datasets including WSJ0-2mix, WHAM! and WHAMR!.

Title: An Empirical Bayes approach to ARX Estimation
Authors: Timofei Leahu, Giorgio Picci
Abstract: Empirical Bayes inference is based on estimation of the parameters of an a priori distribution from the observed data. The estimation technique of the parameters of the prior, called hyperparameters, is based on the marginal distribution obtained by integrating the joint density of the model with respect to the prior. This is a key step which needs to be properly adapted to the problem at hand. In this paper we study Empirical Bayes inference of linear autoregressive models with inputs (ARX models) for time series and compare the performance of the marginal parametric estimator with that a full Empirical Bayesian analysis based on the estimated prior. Such a comparison, can only make sense for a (realistic) finite data length. In this setting, we propose a new estimation technique of the hyperparameters by a sequential Bayes procedure which is essentially a backward Kalman filter. It turns out that for finite data length the marginal Bayes tends to behave slightly better than the full Empirical Bayesian parameter estimator and so also in the case of slowly varying random parameters.

Title: BRISC: Annotated Dataset for Brain Tumor Segmentation and Classification
Authors: Amirreza Fateh, Yasin Rezvani, Sara Moayedi, Sadjad Rezvani, Fatemeh Fateh, Mansoor Fateh, Vahid Abolghasemi
Abstract: Accurate segmentation and classification of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remain key challenges in medical image analysis, primarily due to the lack of high-quality, balanced, and diverse datasets with expert annotations. In this work, we address this gap by introducing BRISC, a dataset designed for brain tumor segmentation and classification tasks, featuring high-resolution segmentation masks. The dataset comprises 6,000 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans, which were collated from multiple public datasets that lacked segmentation labels. Our primary contribution is the subsequent expert annotation of these images, performed by certified radiologists and physicians. It includes three major tumor types, namely glioma, meningioma, and pituitary, as well as non-tumorous cases. Each sample includes high-resolution labels and is categorized across axial, sagittal, and coronal imaging planes to facilitate robust model development and cross-view generalization. To demonstrate the utility of the dataset, we provide benchmark results for both tasks using standard deep learning models. The BRISC dataset is made publicly available. datasetlink: Kaggle (this https URL), Figshare (this https URL), Zenodo (this https URL)

Title: Recurrent neural network-based robust control systems with closed-loop regional incremental ISS and application to MPC design
Authors: Daniele Ravasio, Marcello Farina, Alessio La Bella, Andrea Ballarino
Abstract: This paper investigates the design of output-feedback schemes for systems described by a class of recurrent neural networks. We propose a procedure based on linear matrix inequalities for designing an observer and a static state-feedback controller. The algorithm leverages global and regional incremental input-to-state stability (incremental ISS) and enables the tracking of constant setpoints, ensuring robustness to disturbances and state estimation uncertainty. To address the potential limitations of regional incremental ISS, we introduce an alternative scheme in which the static law is replaced with a tube-based nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) that exploits regional incremental ISS properties. We show that these conditions enable the formulation of a robust NMPC law with guarantees of convergence and recursive feasibility, leading to an enlarged region of attraction. Theoretical results are validated through numerical simulations on the pH-neutralisation process benchmark.

Title: ThinkSound: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models for Audio Generation and Editing
Authors: Huadai Liu, Kaicheng Luo, Jialei Wang, Wen Wang, Qian Chen, Zhou Zhao, Wei Xue
Abstract: While end-to-end video-to-audio generation has greatly improved, producing high-fidelity audio that authentically captures the nuances of visual content remains challenging. Like professionals in the creative industries, this generation requires sophisticated reasoning about items such as visual dynamics, acoustic environments, and temporal relationships. We present ThinkSound, a novel framework that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to enable stepwise, interactive audio generation and editing for videos. Our approach decomposes the process into three complementary stages: foundational foley generation that creates semantically coherent soundscapes, interactive object-centric refinement through precise user interactions, and targeted editing guided by natural language instructions. At each stage, a multimodal large language model generates contextually aligned CoT reasoning that guides a unified audio foundation model. Furthermore, we introduce AudioCoT, a comprehensive dataset with structured reasoning annotations that establishes connections between visual content, textual descriptions, and sound synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that ThinkSound achieves state-of-the-art performance in video-to-audio generation across both audio metrics and CoT metrics, and excels in the out-of-distribution Movie Gen Audio benchmark.

Title: Accounting for Subsystem Aging Variability in Battery Energy Storage System Optimization
Authors: Melina Graner, Martin Cornejo, Holger Hesse, Andreas Jossen
Abstract: This paper presents a degradation-cost-aware optimization framework for multi-string battery energy storage systems, emphasizing the impact of inhomogeneous subsystem-level aging in operational decision-making. We evaluate four scenarios for an energy arbitrage scenario, that vary in model precision and treatment of aging costs. Key performance metrics include operational revenue, power schedule mismatch, missed revenues, capacity losses, and revenue generated per unit of capacity loss. Our analysis reveals that ignoring heterogeneity of subunits may lead to infeasible dispatch plans and reduced revenues. In contrast, combining accurate representation of degraded subsystems and the consideration of aging costs in the objective function improves operational accuracy and economic efficiency of BESS with heterogeneous aged subunits. The fully informed scenario, which combines aging-cost-aware optimization with precise string-level modeling, achieves 21% higher revenue per unit of SOH loss compared to the baseline scenario. These findings highlight that modeling aging heterogeneity is not just a technical refinement but may become a crucial enabler for maximizing both short-term profitability and long-term asset value in particular for long BESS usage scenarios.

Title: PGD-based optimization of 3D bobsleigh track centerlines from 2D centerlines for simulation applications
Authors: Zhe Chen, Huichao Zhao, Yongfeng Jiang, Minghui Bai, Lun Li, Jicheng Chen
Abstract: The centerline of a bobsleigh track defines its geometry and is essential for simulation modeling. To reduce bBobsleigh training costs, leveraging the centerline of the bobsleigh track to construct a virtual environment that closely replicates real competitive settings presents a promising solution. However, publicly available centerline data are typically limited and it is imprecise to construct a training system solely based on 2-dimensional (2D) centerline. To address this practical issue, this paper proposes a method for generating a 3-dimensional (3D) track centerline based on 2D centerline data. Incorporating international track design regulations, the method formulates an optimization problem that considers total track length, height difference, slope constraints, and geometric continuity. A Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem. The generated 3D centerlines are compared with real track data, and the results show that the method can reproduce realistic centerline trends from original or scaled 2D data. For the selected track segment, the relative errors in total length, height difference, and average slope are within 1.7%, 3.2% and 4.1%, respectively, for real 2D data and within 1.1%, 3.5% and 4.3% respectively for scaled data. All slope values remain within the allowable limits. Moreover, by adjusting the segmentation or modifying the weight of height difference in the cost function, various centerline styles applicable to different competitions can be generated. Under different segmentation and weight factors, the maximum errors reach up to 4.4%, 4.8%, and 9.8%, and 4.4%, 4.8%, and 10.0%, respectively. The proposed method provides a flexible and efficient tool for supporting bobsleigh track centerline design.

Title: Fast and Robust Stationary Crowd Counting with Commodity WiFi
Authors: Mert Torun, Alireza Parsay, Yasamin Mostofi
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for estimating the size of seated crowds with commodity WiFi signals, by leveraging natural body fidgeting behaviors as a passive sensing cue. Departing from prior binary fidget representations, our approach leverages the bandwidth of the received signal as a finer-grained and robust indicator of crowd counts. More specifically, we propose a mathematical model that relates the probability density function (PDF) of the signal bandwidth to the crowd size, using a principled derivation based on the PDF of an individual's fidget-induced bandwidth. To characterize the individual fidgeting PDF, we use publicly available online videos, each of a seated individual, from which we extract body motion profiles using vision techniques, followed by a speed-to-bandwidth conversion inspired by Carson's Rule from analog FM radio design. Finally, to enhance robustness in real-world deployments where unrelated motions may occur nearby, we further introduce an anomaly detection module that filters out non-fidget movements. We validate our system through 42 experiments across two indoor environments with crowd sizes up to and including 13 people, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.04 and a normalized mean square error of 0.15, with an average convergence time of 51 seconds, significantly reducing the convergence time as compared to the state of the art. Additional simulation results demonstrate scalability to larger crowd sizes. Overall, our results show that our pipeline enables fast, robust, and highly accurate counting of seated crowds.

Title: StutterZero and StutterFormer: End-to-End Speech Conversion for Stuttering Transcription and Correction
Authors: Qianheng Xu
Abstract: Over 70 million people worldwide experience stuttering, yet most automatic speech systems misinterpret disfluent utterances or fail to transcribe them accurately. Existing methods for stutter correction rely on handcrafted feature extraction or multi-stage automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) pipelines, which separate transcription from audio reconstruction and often amplify distortions. This work introduces StutterZero and StutterFormer, the first end-to-end waveform-to-waveform models that directly convert stuttered speech into fluent speech while jointly predicting its transcription. StutterZero employs a convolutional-bidirectional LSTM encoder-decoder with attention, whereas StutterFormer integrates a dual-stream Transformer with shared acoustic-linguistic representations. Both architectures are trained on paired stuttered-fluent data synthesized from the SEP-28K and LibriStutter corpora and evaluated on unseen speakers from the FluencyBank dataset. Across all benchmarks, StutterZero had a 24% decrease in Word Error Rate (WER) and a 31% improvement in semantic similarity (BERTScore) compared to the leading Whisper-Medium model. StutterFormer achieved better results, with a 28% decrease in WER and a 34% improvement in BERTScore. The results validate the feasibility of direct end-to-end stutter-to-fluent speech conversion, offering new opportunities for inclusive human-computer interaction, speech therapy, and accessibility-oriented AI systems.

Title: RIS-Assisted 3D Spherical Splatting for Object Composition Visualization using Detection Transformers
Authors: Anastasios T. Sotiropoulos, Stavros Tsimpoukis, Dimitrios Tyrovolas, Sotiris Ioannidis, Panagiotis D. Diamantoulakis, George K. Karagiannidis, Christos K. Liaskos
Abstract: The pursuit of immersive and structurally aware multimedia experiences has intensified interest in sensing modalities that reconstruct objects beyond the limits of visible light. Conventional optical pipelines degrade under occlusion or low illumination, motivating the use of radio-frequency (RF) sensing, whose electromagnetic waves penetrate materials and encode both geometric and compositional information. Yet, uncontrolled multipath propagation restricts reconstruction accuracy. Recent advances in Programmable Wireless Environments (PWEs) mitigate this limitation by enabling software-defined manipulation of propagation through Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs), thereby providing controllable illumination diversity. Building on this capability, this work introduces a PWE-driven RF framework for three-dimensional object reconstruction using material-aware spherical primitives. The proposed approach combines RIS-enabled field synthesis with a Detection Transformer (DETR) that infers spatial and material parameters directly from extracted RF features. Simulation results confirm the framework's ability to approximate object geometries and classify material composition with an overall accuracy of 79.35%, marking an initial step toward programmable and physically grounded RF-based 3D object composition visualization.

Title: A Versatile Depth Video Encoding Scheme Based on Low-rank Tensor Modeling for Free Viewpoint Video
Authors: Mansi Sharma, Jyotsana Grover
Abstract: The compression quality losses of depth sequences determine quality of view synthesis in free-viewpoint video. The depth map intra prediction in 3D extensions of the HEVC applies intra modes with auxiliary depth modeling modes (DMMs) to better preserve depth edges and handle motion discontinuities. Although such modes enable high efficiency compression, but at the cost of very high encoding complexity. Skipping conventional intra coding modes and DMMs in depth coding limits practical applicability of the HEVC for 3D display applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel low-complexity scheme for depth video compression based on low-rank tensor decomposition and HEVC intra coding. The proposed scheme leverages spatial and temporal redundancy by compactly representing the depth sequence as a high-order tensor. Tensor factorization into a set of factor matrices following CANDECOMP PARAFAC (CP) decomposition via alternating least squares give a low-rank approximation of the scene geometry. Further, compression of factor matrices with HEVC intra prediction support arbitrary target accuracy by flexible adjustment of bitrate, varying tensor decomposition ranks and quantization parameters. The results demonstrate proposed approach achieves significant rate gains by efficiently compressing depth planes in low-rank approximated representation. The proposed algorithm is applied to encode depth maps of benchmark Ballet and Breakdancing sequences. The decoded depth sequences are used for view synthesis in a multi-view video system, maintaining appropriate rendering quality.

Title: Unifying Symbolic Music Arrangement: Track-Aware Reconstruction and Structured Tokenization
Authors: Longshen Ou, Jingwei Zhao, Ziyu Wang, Gus Xia, Qihao Liang, Torin Hopkins Ye Wang
Abstract: We present a unified framework for automatic multitrack music arrangement that enables a single pre-trained symbolic music model to handle diverse arrangement scenarios, including reinterpretation, simplification, and additive generation. At its core is a segment-level reconstruction objective operating on token-level disentangled content and style, allowing for flexible any-to-any instrumentation transformations at inference time. To support track-wise modeling, we introduce REMI-z, a structured tokenization scheme for multitrack symbolic music that enhances modeling efficiency and effectiveness for both arrangement tasks and unconditional generation. Our method outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art models on representative tasks in different arrangement scenarios -- band arrangement, piano reduction, and drum arrangement, in both objective metrics and perceptual evaluations. Taken together, our framework demonstrates strong generality and suggests broader applicability in symbolic music-to-music transformation.

Title: FusionRF: High-Fidelity Satellite Neural Radiance Fields from Multispectral and Panchromatic Acquisitions
Authors: Michael Sprintson, Rama Chellappa, Cheng Peng
Abstract: We introduce FusionRF, a novel framework for digital surface reconstruction from satellite multispectral and panchromatic images. Current work has demonstrated the increased accuracy of neural photogrammetry for surface reconstruction from optical satellite images compared to algorithmic methods. Common satellites produce both a panchromatic and multispectral image, which contain high spatial and spectral information respectively. Current neural reconstruction methods require multispectral images to be upsampled with a pansharpening method using the spatial data in the panchromatic image. However, these methods may introduce biases and hallucinations due to domain gaps. FusionRF introduces joint image fusion during optimization through a novel cross-resolution kernel that learns to resolve spatial resolution loss present in multispectral images. As input, FusionRF accepts the original multispectral and panchromatic data, eliminating the need for image preprocessing. FusionRF also leverages multimodal appearance embeddings that encode the image characteristics of each modality and view within a uniform representation. By optimizing on both modalities, FusionRF learns to fuse image modalities while performing reconstruction tasks and eliminates the need for a pansharpening preprocessing step. We evaluate our method on multispectral and panchromatic satellite images from the WorldView-3 satellite in various locations, and show that FusionRF provides an average of 17% reduction in depth reconstruction error, and renders sharp training and novel views.

Title: Improving the Accuracy of DC Optimal Power Flow Formulations via Parameter Optimization
Authors: Babak Taheri, Daniel K. Molzahn
Abstract: DC Optimal Power Flow (DC-OPF) problems optimize the generators' active power setpoints while satisfying constraints based on the DC power flow linearization. The computational tractability advantages of DC-OPF problems come at the expense of inaccuracies relative to AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problems that accurately model the nonlinear steady-state behavior of power grids. This paper proposes an algorithm that significantly improves the accuracy of the generators' active power setpoints from DC-OPF problems with respect to the corresponding AC-OPF problems over a specified range of operating conditions. Using sensitivity information in a machine learning-inspired methodology, this algorithm tunes coefficient and bias parameters in the DC power flow approximation to improve the accuracy of the resulting DC-OPF solutions. Employing the Truncated Newton Conjugate-Gradient (TNC) method -- a Quasi-Newton optimization technique -- this parameter tuning occurs during an offline training phase, with the resulting parameters then used in online computations. Numerical results underscore the algorithm's efficacy with accuracy improvements in squared two-norm and $\infty$-norm losses of up to $90\%$ and $79\%$, respectively, relative to traditional DC-OPF formulations.

Title: Proximal Gradient Dynamics and Feedback Control for Equality-Constrained Composite Optimization
Authors: Veronica Centorrino, Francesca Rossi, Francesco Bullo, Giovanni Russo
Abstract: This paper studies equality-constrained composite minimization problems. This class of problems, capturing regularization terms and inequality constraints, naturally arises in a wide range of engineering and machine learning applications. To tackle these optimization problems, inspired by recent results, we introduce the \emph{proportional--integral proximal gradient dynamics} (PI--PGD): a closed-loop system where the Lagrange multipliers are control inputs and states are the problem decision variables. First, we establish the equivalence between the stationary points of the minimization problem and the equilibria of the PI--PGD. Then for the case of affine constraints, by leveraging tools from contraction theory we give a comprehensive convergence analysis for the dynamics, showing linear--exponential convergence towards the equilibrium. That is, the distance between each solution and the equilibrium is upper bounded by a function that first decreases linearly and then exponentially. Our findings are illustrated numerically on a set of representative examples, which include an exploratory application to nonlinear equality constraints.

Title: Asynchronous Push-sum Dual Gradient Algorithm in Distributed Model Predictive Control
Authors: Pengbiao Wang, Xuemei Ren, Dongdong Zheng
Abstract: This paper studies the distributed model predictive control (DMPC) problem for distributed discrete-time linear systems with both local and global constraints over directed communication networks. We establish an optimization problem to formulate the DMPC policy, including the design of terminal ingredients. To cope with the global constraint, we transform the primal optimization problem into its dual problem. Then, we propose a novel asynchronous push-sum dual gradient (APDG) algorithm with an adaptive step-size scheme to solve this dual problem in a fully asynchronous distributed manner. The proposed algorithm does not require synchronous waiting and any form of coordination, which greatly improves solving efficiency. We prove that the APDG algorithm converges at an R-linear rate as long as the step-size does not exceed the designed upper bound. Furthermore, we develop a distributed termination criterion to terminate the APDG algorithm when its output solution satisfies the specified suboptimality and the global constraint, thereby avoiding an infinite number of iterations. The recursive feasibility and the stability of the closed-loop system are also established. Finally, a numerical example is provided to clarify and validate our theoretical findings.

Title: Omni-Router: Sharing Routing Decisions in Sparse Mixture-of-Experts for Speech Recognition
Authors: Zijin Gu, Tatiana Likhomanenko, Navdeep Jaitly
Abstract: Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures have expanded from language modeling to automatic speech recognition (ASR). Traditional MoE methods, such as the Switch Transformer, route experts independently within each layer. Our analysis reveals that routers in most layers make expert choices that are not strongly correlated with the choices of the routers in other layers. To increase the cooperation between experts in different layers and encourage greater specialization, we use a shared router across different MoE layers. We call this model Omni-router Transformer. Extensive experiments on a large-scale pseudo-labeled dataset and evaluations across 10 diverse, out-of-domain ASR benchmarks demonstrate that the Omni-router Transformer is able to achieve lower training loss and consistently outperform dense and Switch Transformer models, reducing average word error rates by 11.2% and 8.2%, respectively, while providing structured expert usage and improved robustness to diverse data.

Title: Human-Exoskeleton Kinematic Calibration to Improve Hand Tracking for Dexterous Teleoperation
Authors: Haiyun Zhang, Stefano Dalla Gasperina, Saad N. Yousaf, Toshimitsu Tsuboi, Tetsuya Narita, Ashish D. Deshpande
Abstract: Hand exoskeletons are critical tools for dexterous teleoperation and immersive manipulation interfaces, but achieving accurate hand tracking remains a challenge due to user-specific anatomical variability and donning inconsistencies. These issues lead to kinematic misalignments that degrade tracking performance and limit applicability in precision tasks. We propose a subject-specific calibration framework for exoskeleton-based hand tracking that estimates virtual link parameters through residual-weighted optimization. A data-driven approach is introduced to empirically tune cost function weights using motion capture ground truth, enabling accurate and consistent calibration across users. Implemented on the Maestro hand exoskeleton with seven healthy participants, the method achieved substantial reductions in joint and fingertip tracking errors across diverse hand geometries. Qualitative visualizations using a Unity-based virtual hand further demonstrate improved motion fidelity. The proposed framework generalizes to exoskeletons with closed-loop kinematics and minimal sensing, laying the foundation for high-fidelity teleoperation and robot learning applications.

Title: Wireless Laser Power Transfer for Low-altitude Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle-assisted Internet of Things: Paradigms, Challenges, and Solutions
Authors: Chengzhen Li, Likun Zhang, Chuang Zhang, Jiahui Li, Changyuan Zhao, Ruichen Zhang, Geng Sun
Abstract: Low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become integral enablers for the Internet of Things (IoT) by offering enhanced coverage, improved connectivity and access to remote areas. A critical challenge limiting their operational capacity lies in the energy constraints of both aerial platforms and ground-based sensors. This paper explores WLPT as a transformative solution for sustainable energy provisioning in UAV-assisted IoT networks. We first systematically investigate the fundamental principles of WLPT and analysis the comparative advantages. Then, we introduce three operational paradigms for system integration, identify key challenges, and discuss corresponding potential solutions. In case study, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to address the coordination and optimization challenges in WLPT-enabled UAV-assisted IoT data collection. Simulation results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves energy sustainability and data freshness. Finally, we discuss some future directions.

Title: Numerical Spectrum Linking: Identification of Governing PDE via Koopman-Chebyshev Approximation
Authors: Phonepaserth Sisaykeo, Shogo Muramatsu
Abstract: A numerical framework is proposed for identifying partial differential equations (PDEs) governing dynamical systems directly from their observation data using Chebyshev polynomial approximation. In contrast to data-driven approaches such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which approximate the Koopman operator without a clear connection to differential operators, the proposed method constructs finite-dimensional Koopman matrices by projecting the dynamics onto a Chebyshev basis, thereby capturing both differential and nonlinear terms. This establishes a numerical link between the Koopman and differential operators. Numerical experiments on benchmark dynamical systems confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the approach, underscoring its potential for interpretable operator learning. The framework also lays a foundation for future integration with symbolic regression, enabling the construction of explicit mathematical models directly from data.

Title: On Improvisation and Open-Endedness: Insights for Experiential AI
Authors: Botao 'Amber' Hu
Abstract: Improvisation-the art of spontaneous creation that unfolds moment-to-moment without a scripted outcome-requires practitioners to continuously sense, adapt, and create anew. It is a fundamental mode of human creativity spanning music, dance, and everyday life. The open-ended nature of improvisation produces a stream of novel, unrepeatable moments-an aspect highly valued in artistic creativity. In parallel, open-endedness (OE)-a system's capacity for unbounded novelty and endless "interestingness"-is exemplified in natural or cultural evolution and has been considered "the last grand challenge" in artificial life (ALife). The rise of generative AI now raises the question in computational creativity (CC) research: What makes a "good" improvisation for AI? Can AI learn to improvise in a genuinely open-ended way? In this work-in-progress paper, we report insights from in-depth interviews with 6 experts in improvisation across dance, music, and contact improvisation. We draw systemic connections between human improvisational arts and the design of future experiential AI agents that could improvise alone or alongside humans-or even with other AI agents-embodying qualities of improvisation drawn from practice: active listening (umwelt and awareness), being in the time (mindfulness and ephemerality), embracing the unknown (source of randomness and serendipity), non-judgmental flow (acceptance and dynamical stability, balancing structure and surprise (unpredictable criticality at edge of chaos), imaginative metaphor (synaesthesia and planning), empathy, trust, boundary, and care (mutual theory of mind), and playfulness and intrinsic motivation (maintaining interestingness).

Title: Reliability Assessment Framework Based on Feature Separability for Pathological Cell Image Classification under Prior Bias
Authors: Takaaki Tachibana, Toru Nagasaka, Yukari Adachi, Hiroki Kagiyama, Ryota Ito, Mitsugu Fujita, Kimihiro Yamashita, Yoshihiro Kakeji
Abstract: Background and objective: Prior probability shift between training and deployment datasets challenges deep learning--based medical image classification. Standard correction methods reweight posterior probabilities to adjust prior bias, yet their benefit is inconsistent. We developed a reliability framework identifying when prior correction helps or harms performance in pathological cell image analysis. Methods: We analyzed 303 colorectal cancer specimens with CD103/CD8 immunostaining, yielding 185,432 annotated cell images across 16 cell types. ResNet models were trained under varying bias ratios (1.1--20$\times$). Feature separability was quantified using cosine similarity--based likelihood quality scores, reflecting intra- versus inter-class distinctions in learned feature spaces. Multiple linear regression, ANOVA, and generalized additive models (GAMs) evaluated associations among feature separability, prior bias, sample adequacy, and F1 performance. Results: Feature separability dominated performance ($\beta = 1.650$, $p < 0.001$), showing 412-fold stronger impact than prior bias ($\beta = 0.004$, $p = 0.018$). GAM analysis showed strong predictive power ($R^2 = 0.876$) with mostly linear trends. A quality threshold of 0.294 effectively identified cases requiring correction (AUC = 0.610). Cell types scoring $>0.5$ were robust without correction, whereas those $<0.3$ consistently required adjustment. Conclusion: Feature extraction quality, not bias magnitude, governs correction benefit. The proposed framework provides quantitative guidance for selective correction, enabling efficient deployment and reliable diagnostic AI.
