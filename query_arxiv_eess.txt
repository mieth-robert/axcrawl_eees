Title: Self-Supervised Score-Based Despeckling for SAR Imagery via Log-Domain Transformation
Authors: Junhyuk Heo
Abstract: The speckle noise inherent in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery significantly degrades image quality and complicates subsequent analysis. Given that SAR speckle is multiplicative and Gamma-distributed, effectively despeckling SAR imagery remains challenging. This paper introduces a novel self-supervised framework for SAR image despeckling based on score-based generative models operating in the transformed log domain. We first transform the data into the log-domain and then convert the speckle noise residuals into an approximately additive Gaussian distribution. This step enables the application of score-based models, which are trained in the transformed domain using a self-supervised objective. This objective allows our model to learn the clean underlying signal by training on further corrupted versions of the input data itself. Consequently, our method exhibits significantly shorter inference times compared to many existing self-supervised techniques, offering a robust and practical solution for SAR image restoration.

Title: Unsupervised Deformable Image Registration with Local-Global Attention and Image Decomposition
Authors: Zhengyong Huang, Xingwen Sun, Xuting Chang, Ning Jiang, Yao Wang, Jianfei Sun, Hongbin Han, Yao Sui
Abstract: Deformable image registration is a critical technology in medical image analysis, with broad applications in clinical practice such as disease diagnosis, multi-modal fusion, and surgical navigation. Traditional methods often rely on iterative optimization, which is computationally intensive and lacks generalizability. Recent advances in deep learning have introduced attention-based mechanisms that improve feature alignment, yet accurately registering regions with high anatomical variability remains challenging. In this study, we proposed a novel unsupervised deformable image registration framework, LGANet++, which employs a novel local-global attention mechanism integrated with a unique technique for feature interaction and fusion to enhance registration accuracy, robustness, and generalizability. We evaluated our approach using five publicly available datasets, representing three distinct registration scenarios: cross-patient, cross-time, and cross-modal CT-MR registration. The results demonstrated that our approach consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art registration methods, improving registration accuracy by 1.39% in cross-patient registration, 0.71% in cross-time registration, and 6.12% in cross-modal CT-MR registration tasks. These results underscore the potential of LGANet++ to support clinical workflows requiring reliable and efficient image registration. The source code is available at this https URL.

Title: Partial Decoder Attention Network with Contour-weighted Loss Function for Data-Imbalance Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Zhengyong Huang, Ning Jiang, Xingwen Sun, Lihua Zhang, Peng Chen, Jens Domke, Yao Sui
Abstract: Image segmentation is pivotal in medical image analysis, facilitating clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease evaluation. Deep learning has significantly advanced automatic segmentation methodologies by providing superior modeling capability for complex structures and fine-grained anatomical regions. However, medical images often suffer from data imbalance issues, such as large volume disparities among organs or tissues, and uneven sample distributions across different anatomical structures. This imbalance tends to bias the model toward larger organs or more frequently represented structures, while overlooking smaller or less represented structures, thereby affecting the segmentation accuracy and robustness. To address these challenges, we proposed a novel contour-weighted segmentation approach, which improves the model's capability to represent small and underrepresented structures. We developed PDANet, a lightweight and efficient segmentation network based on a partial decoder mechanism. We evaluated our method using three prominent public datasets. The experimental results show that our methodology excelled in three distinct tasks: segmenting multiple abdominal organs, brain tumors, and pelvic bone fragments with injuries. It consistently outperformed nine state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the proposed contour-weighted strategy improved segmentation for other comparison methods across the three datasets, yielding average enhancements in Dice scores of 2.32%, 1.67%, and 3.60%, respectively. These results demonstrate that our contour-weighted segmentation method surpassed current leading approaches in both accuracy and robustness. As a model-independent strategy, it can seamlessly fit various segmentation frameworks, enhancing their performance. This flexibility highlighted its practical importance and potential for broad use in medical image analysis.

Title: All-Pass Fractional OPF: A Solver-Friendly, Physics-Preserving Approximation of AC OPF
Authors: Milad Hasanzadeh, Amin Kargarian, Javad Lavaei
Abstract: This paper presents a fractional approximation of the AC optimal power flow (AC OPF) problem based on an all-pass approximation of the exponential power flow kernel. The classical AC OPF relies on trigonometric coupling between bus voltage phasors, which yields a nonconvex program with oscillatory derivatives that can slow, or in some cases destabilize, interior-point methods. We replace the trigonometric terms with an all-pass fractional (APF) approximation whose real and imaginary components act as smooth surrogates for the cosine and sine functions, and we introduce a pre-rotation to shift the argument of the approximation toward its most accurate region, ensuring that the reformulated power flow model preserves physical loss behavior, maintains the symmetry of the classical kernels, and improves the conditioning of the Jacobian and Hessian matrices. The proposed APF OPF formulation remains nonconvex, as in the classical model, but it eliminates trigonometric evaluations and empirically produces larger and more stable Newton steps under standard interior-point solvers. Numerical results on more than 25 IEEE and PGLib test systems ranging from 9 to 10{,}000 buses demonstrate that the APF OPF model achieves solutions with accuracy comparable to that of the classical formulation while reducing solver times, indicating a more solver-friendly nonconvex representation of AC OPF. All code, functions, verification scripts, and generated results are publicly available on \href{this https URL}{GitHub}, along with a README describing how to run and reproduce the experiments.

Title: Towards noise-robust speech inversion through multi-task learning with speech enhancement
Authors: Saba Tabatabaee, Carol Espy-Wilson
Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate the effectiveness of Self Supervised Learning (SSL) speech representations for Speech Inversion (SI). However, applying SI in real-world scenarios remains challenging due to the pervasive presence of background noise. We propose a unified framework that integrates Speech Enhancement (SE) and SI models through shared SSL-based speech representations. In this framework, the SSL model is trained not only to support the SE module in suppressing noise but also to produce representations that are more informative for the SI task, allowing both modules to benefit from joint training. At a Signal-to-Noise Ratio of -5 db, our method for the SI task achieves relative improvements over the baseline of 80.95% under babble noise and 38.98% under non-babble noise, as measured by the average Pearson product-moment correlation across all estimated parameters.

Title: An Ion-Intercalation Memristor for Enabling Full Parallel Writing in Crossbar Networks
Authors: Tingwei Zhang, Jiahui Liu, David Allstot, Huaping Liu
Abstract: Crossbar architectures have long been seen as a promising foundation for in-memory computing, using memristor arrays for high-density, energy-efficient analog computation. However, this conventional architecture suffers from a fundamental limitation: the inability to perform parallel write operations due to the sneak path problem. This arises from the structural overlap of read and write paths, forcing sequential or semi-parallel updates and severely limiting scalability. To address this, we introduce a new memristor design that decouples read and write operations at the device level. This design enables orthogonal conductive paths, and employs a reversible ion doping mechanism, inspired by lithium-ion battery principles, to modulate resistance states independently of computation. Fabricated devices exhibit near-ideal memristive characteristics and stable performance under isolated read/write conditions.

Title: Scaling Ambiguity: Augmenting Human Annotation in Speech Emotion Recognition with Audio-Language Models
Authors: Wenda Zhang, Hongyu Jin, Siyi Wang, Zhiqiang Wei, Ting Dang
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition models typically use single categorical labels, overlooking the inherent ambiguity of human emotions. Ambiguous Emotion Recognition addresses this by representing emotions as probability distributions, but progress is limited by unreliable ground-truth distributions inferred from sparse human annotations. This paper explores whether Large Audio-Language Models (ALMs) can mitigate the annotation bottleneck by generating high-quality synthetic annotations. We introduce a framework leveraging ALMs to create Synthetic Perceptual Proxies, augmenting human annotations to improve ground-truth distribution reliability. We validate these proxies through statistical analysis of their alignment with human distributions and evaluate their impact by fine-tuning ALMs with the augmented emotion distributions. Furthermore, to address class imbalance and enable unbiased evaluation, we propose DiME-Aug, a Distribution-aware Multimodal Emotion Augmentation strategy. Experiments on IEMOCAP and MSP-Podcast show that synthetic annotations enhance emotion distribution, especially in low-ambiguity regions where annotation agreement is high. However, benefits diminish for highly ambiguous emotions with greater human disagreement. This work provides the first evidence that ALMs could address annotation scarcity in ambiguous emotion recognition, but highlights the need for more advanced prompting or generation strategies to handle highly ambiguous cases.

Title: Input-to-State Stabilizing Neural Controllers for Unknown Switched Nonlinear Systems within Compact Sets
Authors: Bhabani Shankar Dey, Ahan Basu, Pushpak Jagtap
Abstract: This paper develops a neural network based control framework that ensures system safety and input-to-state stability (ISS) for general nonlinear switched systems with unknown dynamics. Leveraging the concept of dwell time, we derive Lyapunov based sufficient conditions under which both safety and ISS of the closed-loop switched system are guaranteed. The feedback controllers and the associated Lyapunov functions are parameterized using neural networks and trained from data collected over a compact state space via deterministic sampling. To provide formal stability guarantees under the learned controllers, we introduce a validity condition based on Lipschitz continuity assumptions, which is embedded directly into the training framework. This ensures that the resulting neural network controllers satisfy provable correctness and stability guarantees beyond the sampled data. As a special case, the proposed framework recovers ISS and safety under arbitrary switching when a common Lyapunov function exists. Simulation results on a representative switched nonlinear system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Title: Experimental Performance of Bidirectional Phase Coherent Transmission and Sensing for mmWave Cell-free Massive MIMO Systems with Reciprocity Calibration
Authors: Qingji Jiang, Jing jin, Qixing Wang, Yuanyuan Tang, Yang Cao, Bin Kuang, Jing Dong, Siying Lv, Dongming Wang, Yongming Huang, Jiangzhou Wang, Xiaohu You
Abstract: Phase synchronization among distributed transmission reception points (TRPs) is a prerequisite for enabling coherent joint transmission and high-precision sensing in millimeter wave (mmWave) cell-free massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems. This paper proposes a bidirectional calibration scheme and a calibration coefficient estimation method for phase synchronization, and presents a calibration coefficient phase tracking method using unilateral uplink/downlink channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, this paper introduces the use of reciprocity calibration to eliminate non-ideal factors in sensing and leverages sensing results to achieve calibration coefficient phase tracking in dynamic scenarios, thus enabling bidirectional empowerment of both communication and sensing. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively implement reciprocal calibration with lower overhead, enabling coherent collaborative transmission, and resolving non-ideal factors to acquire lower sensing error in sensing applications. Experimental results show that, in the mmWave band, over-the-air (OTA) bidirectional calibration enables coherent collaborative transmission for both collaborative TRPs and collaborative user equipments (UEs), achieving beamforming gain and long-time coherent sensing capabilities.

Title: Calibrated uncertainty quantification for prosumer flexibility aggregation in ancillary service markets
Authors: Yogesh Pipada Sunil Kumar, S. Ali Pourmousavi, Jon A.R. Liisberg, Julian Lesmos-Vinasco
Abstract: Reliable forecasting of prosumer flexibility is critical for demand response aggregators participating in frequency controlled ancillary services market, where strict reliability requirements such as the P90 standard are enforced. Limited historical data, dependence on exogeneous factors, and heterogenous prosumer behaviour introduce significant epistemic uncertainty, making deterministic or poorly calibrated probabilistic models unsuitable for market bidding. This paper proposes the use of scalable uncertainty quantification framework that integrates Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) with conformal prediction (CP) to produce calibrated, finite sample prediction intervals for aggregated prosumer flexibility. The proposed framework is applied to a behind-the-meter aggregator participating in the Danish manual frequency restoration reserve capacity market. A large-scale synthetic dataset is generated using a modified industry-grade home energy management system, combined with publicly available load, solar, price, activation and device-level data. The resulting machine learning surrogate model captures aggregate prosumer price responsiveness and provides uncertainty-aware estimates suitable for market bidding. Multiple multivariate CP strategies are evaluated and benchmarked against conventional MCD-based methods. Results show that standalone MCD systematically overestimates available flexibility and violates P90 compliance, whereas the proposed MCD-CP framework achieves reliable coverage with controlled conservatism. When embedded in aggregator bidding model, conformalised methods substantially reduce overbidding risk and achieve upto 70% of perfect-information profit while satisfying regulatory reliability constraints, providing practical, computationally efficient, and market-compliant solution for aggregator flexibility forecasting under uncertainty.

Title: A Two-Stage Risk-Averse DRO-MILP Methodological Framework for Managing AI/Data Center Demand Shocks
Authors: Sharaf K. Magableh, Caisheng Wang, Oraib Dawaghreh
Abstract: The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven data centers is reshaping electricity demand patterns. This is achieved by introducing fast, multi-gigawatt load ramps that challenge the stability and resilience of modern power systems. Traditional resilience frameworks focus mainly on physical outages and largely overlook these emerging digital-era disturbances. This paper proposes a unified two-stage, risk-aware distributionally robust optimization (DRO)-MILP framework that coordinates the pre-allocation and post-event dispatch of Flexible Capacity Modules (FCMs), including BESS, fast-ramping generation, demand response, and potential long-duration storage. Stage-I optimally positions FCMs using DRO with CVaR to hedge against uncertain AI load surges. Stage-II models real-time stabilization following stochastic demand-shock scenarios, minimizing imbalance, unserved energy, and restoration penalties. The framework is designed to be applied on IEEE 33-bus system or expanded for scalability to larger IEEE test feeders capable of representing AI-scale loads. This contributes a scalable planning tool for resilient, AI-integrated distribution grids.

Title: Efficient reformulations of ReLU deep neural networks for surrogate modelling in power system optimisation
Authors: Yogesh Pipada Sunil Kumar, S. Ali Pourmousavi, Jon A.R. Liisberg, Julian Lesmos-Vinasco
Abstract: The ongoing decarbonisation of power systems is driving an increasing reliance on distributed energy resources, which introduces complex and nonlinear interactions that are difficult to capture in conventional optimisation models. As a result, machine learning based surrogate modelling has emerged as a promising approach, but integrating machine learning models such as ReLU deep neural networks (DNNs) directly into optimisation often results in nonconvex and computationally intractable formulations. This paper proposes a linear programming (LP) reformulation for a class of convexified ReLU DNNs with non-negative weight matrices beyond the first layer, enabling a tight and tractable embedding of learned surrogate models in optimisation. We evaluate the method using a case study on learning the prosumer's responsiveness within an aggregator bidding problem in the Danish tertiary capacity market. The proposed reformulation is benchmarked against state-of-the-art alternatives, including piecewise linearisation (PWL), MIP-based embedding, and other LP relaxations. Across multiple neural network architectures and market scenarios, the convexified ReLU DNN achieves solution quality comparable to PWL and MIP-based reformulations while significantly improving computational performance and preserving model fidelity, unlike penalty-based reformulations. The results demonstrate that convexified ReLU DNNs offer a scalable and reliable methodology for integrating learned surrogate models in optimisation, with applicability to a wide range of emerging power system applications.

Title: Ramping-aware Enhanced Flexibility Aggregation of Distributed Generation with Energy Storage in Power Distribution Networks
Authors: Hyeongon Park, Daniel K. Molzahn, Rahul K. Gupta
Abstract: Power distribution networks are increasingly hosting controllable and flexible distributed energy resources (DERs) that, when aggregated, can provide ancillary support to transmission systems. However, existing aggregation schemes often ignore the ramping constraints of these DERs, which can render them impractical in real deployments. This work proposes a ramping-aware flexibility aggregation scheme, computed at the transmission-distribution boundary, that explicitly accounts for DER ramp limits and yields flexibility envelopes that are provably disaggregable. To further enhance the attainable flexibility region, we introduce a novel pre-ramping strategy, which proactively adjusts resource operating points to enlarge the aggregated flexibility envelope while preserving both network feasibility and disaggregation guarantees. The proposed method demonstrates a 5.2% to 19.2% improvement in flexibility relative to the baseline model, depending on system conditions. We validate the scheme on an IEEE-33 bus distribution system and provide formal proofs showing that both aggregation strategies are disaggregable for all feasible trajectories within the aggregate flexibility envelope.

Title: Triage knowledge distillation for speaker verification
Authors: Ju-ho Kim, Youngmoon Jung, Joon-Young Yang, Jaeyoung Roh, Chang Woo Han, Hoon-Young Cho
Abstract: Deploying speaker verification on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to the computational cost of high-capacity models; knowledge distillation (KD) offers a remedy. Classical KD entangles target confidence with non-target structure in a Kullback-Leibler term, limiting the transfer of relational information. Decoupled KD separates these signals into target and non-target terms, yet treats non-targets uniformly and remains vulnerable to the long tail of low-probability classes in large-class settings. We introduce Triage KD (TRKD), a distillation scheme that operationalizes assess-prioritize-focus. TRKD introduces a cumulative-probability cutoff $\tau$ to assess per-example difficulty and partition the teacher posterior into three groups: the target class, a high-probability non-target confusion-set, and a background-set. To prioritize informative signals, TRKD distills the confusion-set conditional distribution and discards the background. Concurrently, it transfers a three-mass (target/confusion/background) that capture sample difficulty and inter-class confusion. Finally, TRKD focuses learning via a curriculum on $\tau$: training begins with a larger $\tau$ to convey broad non-target context, then $\tau$ is progressively decreased to shrink the confusion-set, concentrating supervision on the most confusable classes. In extensive experiments on VoxCeleb1 with both homogeneous and heterogeneous teacher-student pairs, TRKD was consistently superior to recent KD variants and attained the lowest EER across all protocols.

Title: Hierarchical Optimization Based Multi-objective Dynamic Regulation Scheme for VANET Topology
Authors: Ruixing Ren, Minqi Tao, Junhui Zhao, Xiaoke Sun, Qiuping Li
Abstract: As a core technology of intelligent transportation systems, vehicular ad-hoc networks support latency-sensitive services such as safety warning and cooperative perception via vehicle-to-everything communications. However, their highly dynamic topology increases average path length, raises latency, and reduces throughput, severely limiting communication performance. Existing topology optimization methods lack capabilities in multi-objective coordination, dynamic adaptation, and global-local synergy. To address this, this paper proposes a two-layer dynamic topology regulation scheme combining local feature aggregation and global adjustment. The scheme constructs a dynamic multi-objective optimization model integrating average path length, end-to-end latency, and network throughput, and achieves multi-index coordination via link adaptability metrics and a dynamic normalization mechanism. it quickly responds to local link changes via feature fusion of local node feature extraction and dynamic neighborhood sensing, and balances optimization accuracy and real-time performance using a dual-mode adaptive solving strategy for global topology adjustment. It reduces network oscillation risks by introducing a performance improvement threshold and a topology validity verification mechanism. Simulation results on real urban road networks via the SUMO platform show that the proposed scheme outperforms traditional methods in average path length (stabilizing at ~4 hops), end-to-end latency (remaining ~0.01 s), and network throughput.

Title: NLP-Based Review for Toxic Comment Detection Tailored to the Chinese Cyberspace
Authors: Ruixing Ren, Junhui Zhao, Xiaoke Sun, Qiuping Li
Abstract: With the in-depth integration of mobile Internet and widespread adoption of social platforms, user-generated content in the Chinese cyberspace has witnessed explosive growth. Among this content, the proliferation of toxic comments poses severe challenges to individual mental health, community atmosphere and social trust. Owing to the strong context dependence, cultural specificity and rapid evolution of Chinese cyber language, toxic expressions are often conveyed through complex forms such as homophones and metaphors, imposing notable limitations on traditional detection methods. To address this issue, this review focuses on the core topic of natural language processing based toxic comment detection in the Chinese cyberspace, systematically collating and critically analyzing the research progress and key challenges in this field. This review first defines the connotation and characteristics of Chinese toxic comments, and analyzes the platform ecology and transmission mechanisms they rely on. It then comprehensively reviews the construction methods and limitations of existing public datasets, and proposes a novel fine-grained and scalable framework for toxic comment definition and classification, along with corresponding data annotation and quality assessment strategies. We systematically summarize the evolutionary path of detection models from traditional methods to deep learning, with special emphasis on the importance of interpretability in model design. Finally, we thoroughly discuss the open challenges faced by current research and provide forward-looking suggestions for future research directions.

Title: Differential Privacy on Affine Manifolds: Geometrically Confined Privacy in Linear Dynamical Systems
Authors: Zihao Ren, Lei Wang, Deming Yuan, Guodong Shi
Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for differential privacy over affine manifolds and validate its usefulness in the contexts of differentially private cloud-based control and average consensus. We consider differential privacy mechanisms for linear queries when the input data are constrained to lie on affine manifolds, a structural property that is assumed to be available as prior knowledge to adversaries. In this setting, the definition of neighborhood adjacency must be formulated with respect to the intrinsic geometry of the manifolds. We demonstrate that such affine-manifold constraints can fundamentally alter the attainable privacy levels relative to the unconstrained case. In particular, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which differential privacy can be realized via structured noise injection mechanisms, wherein correlated Gaussian or Laplace noise distributions, rather than i.i.d. perturbations, are calibrated to the dataset. Based on these characterizations, we develop explicit noise calibration procedures that guarantee the tight realization of any prescribed privacy budget with a matching noise magnitude. Finally, we show that the proposed framework admits direct applications to linear dynamical systems ranging from differentially private cloud-based control to privacy-preserving average consensus, all of which naturally involve affine-manifold constraints. The established theoretical results are illustrated through numerical examples.

Title: AQAScore: Evaluating Semantic Alignment in Text-to-Audio Generation via Audio Question Answering
Authors: Chun-Yi Kuan, Kai-Wei Chang, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: Although text-to-audio generation has made remarkable progress in realism and diversity, the development of evaluation metrics has not kept pace. Widely-adopted approaches, typically based on embedding similarity like CLAPScore, effectively measure general relevance but remain limited in fine-grained semantic alignment and compositional reasoning. To address this, we introduce AQAScore, a backbone-agnostic evaluation framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of audio-aware large language models (ALLMs). AQAScore reformulates assessment as a probabilistic semantic verification task; rather than relying on open-ended text generation, it estimates alignment by computing the exact log-probability of a "Yes" answer to targeted semantic queries. We evaluate AQAScore across multiple benchmarks, including human-rated relevance, pairwise comparison, and compositional reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that AQAScore consistently achieves higher correlation with human judgments than similarity-based metrics and generative prompting baselines, showing its effectiveness in capturing subtle semantic inconsistencies and scaling with the capability of underlying ALLMs.

Title: Inverse-Hessian Regularization for Continual Learning in ASR
Authors: Steven Vander Eeckt, Hugo Van hamme
Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a major challenge for continual learning (CL) in automatic speech recognition (ASR), where models must adapt to new domains without losing performance on previously learned conditions. Several CL methods have been proposed for ASR, and, recently, weight averaging - where models are averaged in a merging step after fine-tuning - has proven effective as a simple memory-free strategy. However, it is heuristic in nature and ignores the underlying loss landscapes of the tasks, hindering adaptability. In this work, we propose Inverse Hessian Regularization (IHR), a memory-free approach for CL in ASR that incorporates curvature information into the merging step. After fine-tuning on a new task, the adaptation is adjusted through a Kronecker-factored inverse Hessian approximation of the previous task, ensuring that the model moves primarily in directions less harmful to past performance, while keeping the method lightweight. We evaluate IHR on two CL benchmarks and show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing forgetting while improving adaptability. Ablation studies and analyses further confirm its effectiveness.

Title: Improved GPR-Based CSI Acquisition via Spatial-Correlation Kernel
Authors: Syed Luqman Shah, Nurul Huda Mahmood, Italo Atzeni
Abstract: Accurate channel estimation with low pilot overhead and computational complexity is key to efficiently utilizing multi-antenna wireless systems. Motivated by the evolution from purely statistical descriptions toward physics- and geometry-aware propagation models, this work focuses on incorporating channel information into a Gaussian process regression (GPR) framework for improving the channel estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose a GPR-based channel estimation framework along with a novel Spatial-correlation (SC) kernel that explicitly captures the channel's second-order statistics. We derive a closed-form expression of the proposed SC-based GPR estimator and prove that its posterior mean is optimal in terms of minimum mean-square error (MMSE) under the same second-order statistics, without requiring the underlying channel distribution to be Gaussian. Our analysis reveals that, with up to 50% pilot overhead reduction, the proposed method achieves the lowest normalized mean-square error, the highest empirical 95% credible-interval coverage, and superior preservation of spectral efficiency compared to benchmark estimators, while maintaining lower computational complexity than the conventional MMSE estimator.

Title: Test-Time Adaptation For Speech Enhancement Via Mask Polarization
Authors: Tobias Raichle, Erfan Amini, Bin Yang
Abstract: Adapting speech enhancement (SE) models to unseen environments is crucial for practical deployments, yet test-time adaptation (TTA) for SE remains largely under-explored due to a lack of understanding of how SE models degrade under domain shifts. We observe that mask-based SE models lose confidence under domain shifts, with predicted masks becoming flattened and losing decisive speech preservation and noise suppression. Based on this insight, we propose mask polarization (MPol), a lightweight TTA method that restores mask bimodality through distribution comparison using the Wasserstein distance. MPol requires no additional parameters beyond the trained model, making it suitable for resource-constrained edge deployments. Experimental results across diverse domain shifts and architectures demonstrate that MPol achieves very consistent gains that are competitive with significantly more complex approaches.

Title: Integrated Sensing, Communication and Control enabled Agile UAV Swarm
Authors: Zhiqing Wei, Yucong Du, Zhiyong Feng, Haotian Liu, Yanpeng Cui, Tao Zhang, Ying Zhou, Huici Wu
Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms are pivotal in the applications such as disaster relief, aerial base station (BS) and logistics transportation. These scenarios require the capabilities in accurate sensing, efficient communication and flexible control for real-time and reliable task execution. However, sensing, communication and control are studied independently in traditional research, which limits the overall performance of UAV swarms. To overcome this disadvantage, we propose a deeply coupled scheme of integrated sensing, communication and control (ISCC) for UAV swarms, which is a systemic paradigm that transcends traditional isolated designs of sensing, communication and control by establishing a tightly-coupled closed-loop through the co-optimization of sensing, communication and control. In this article, we firstly analyze the requirements of scenarios and key performance metrics. Subsequently, the enabling technologies are proposed, including communication-and-control-enhanced sensing, sensing-and-control-enhanced communication, and sensing-and-communication-enhanced control. Simulation results validate the performance of the proposed ISCC framework, demonstrating its application potential in the future.

Title: LiNUS: Lightweight Automatic Segmentation of Deep Brain Nuclei for Real-Time DBS Surgery
Authors: Shuo Zhang, Zihua Wang, Changgeng He, Chunhua Hu
Abstract: This paper proposes LiNUS, a lightweight deep learning framework for the automatic segmentation of the Subthalamic Nucleus (STN) in Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgery. Addressing the challenges of small target volume and class imbalance in MRI data, LiNUS improves upon the U-Net architecture by introducing spectral normalization constraints, bilinear interpolation upsampling, and a multi-scale feature fusion mechanism. Experimental results on the Tsinghua DBS dataset (TT14) demonstrate that LiNUS achieves a Dice coefficient of 0.679 with an inference time of only 0.05 seconds per subject, significantly outperforming traditional manual and registration-based methods. Further validation on high-resolution data confirms the model's robustness, achieving a Dice score of 0.89. A dedicated Graphical User Interface (GUI) was also developed to facilitate real-time clinical application.

Title: Absorption mode broadband 2D MS for proteomics and metabolomics

Abstract: Two-dimensional mass spectrometry (2D MS) is a method for tandem mass spectrometry that enables the correlation between precursor and fragment ions without the need for ion isolation. On a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer, the phase correction functions for absorption mode data processing were found to be linear in the precursor ion dimension and quadratic in the fragment ion dimension. Absorption mode data processing on limited data sets has previously shown improvements in signal-to-noise ratio and resolving power by a factor of 2. Here, we have expanded absorption mode data processing to 2D mass spectra regardless of size and frequency range. We have applied absorption mode 2D MS to top-down analysis of variously oxidized ubiquitin proteoforms generated by fast photochemical oxidation of proteins (FPOP) and to an extract of ergot alkaloids. We show that absorption mode data processing significantly improves both the signal-to-noise ratio and the resolving power of the 2D mass spectrum compared to standard magnitude mode in terms of sequence coverage in top-down proteomics, as well as the accuracy of precursor-fragment correlation in metabolomics.

Title: Movable Antenna Empowered Covert Dual-Functional Radar-Communication
Authors: Ran Yang, Ning Wei, Zheng Dong, Lin Zhang, Wanting Lyu, Yue Xiu, Ahmad Bazzi, Chadi Assi
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) has emerged as a promising technology to flexibly reconfigure wireless channels by adjusting antenna placement. In this paper, we study a secured dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) system aided by movable antennas. To enhance the communication security, we aim to maximize the achievable sum rate by jointly optimizing the transmitter beamforming vectors, receiving filter, and antenna placement, subject to radar signal-to-noise ratio (SINR) and transmission covertness constraints. We consider multiple Willies operating in both non-colluding and colluding modes. For noncolluding Willies, we first employ a Lagrangian dual transformation procedure to reformulate the challenging optimization problem into a more tractable form. Subsequently, we develop an efficient block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm that integrates semidefinite relaxation (SDR), projected gradient descent (PGD), Dinkelbach transformation, and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques to tackle the resulting problem. For colluding Willies, we first derive the minimum detection error probability (DEP) by characterizing the optimal detection statistic, which is proven to follow the generalized Erlang distribution. Then, we develop a minimum mean square error (MMSE)-based algorithm to address the colluding detection problem. We further provide a comprehensive complexity analysis on the unified design framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the covert sum rate, and achieve a superior balance between communication and radar performance compared with existing benchmark schemes.

Title: Contingency Planning for Safety-Critical Autonomous Vehicles: A Review and Perspectives
Authors: Lei Zheng, Luyao Zhang, Peiqi Yu, Yifan Sun, Sergio Grammatico, Jun Ma, Changliu Liu
Abstract: Contingency planning is the architectural capability that enables autonomous vehicles (AVs) to anticipate and mitigate discrete, high-impact hazards, such as sensor outages and adversarial interactions. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the field, synthesizing fragmented literature into a unified logic-conditioned hybrid control framework. Within this formalism, we categorize approaches into two distinct paradigms: Reactive Safety, which responds to realized hazards by enforcing safety constraints or executing fail-safe maneuvers; and Proactive Safety, which optimizes for future recourse by branching over potential modal transitions. In addition, we propose a fine-grained taxonomy that partitions the landscape into external contingencies (environmental and interactive hazards) and internal contingencies (system faults). Through a critical comparative analysis, we reveal a fundamental structural divergence: internal faults are predominantly addressed via reactive fail-safe mechanisms, whereas external interaction uncertainties increasingly require proactive branching strategies. Furthermore, we identify a critical methodological divergence: whereas physical hazards are typically managed with formal guarantees, semantic and out-of-distribution anomalies currently rely heavily on empirical validation. We conclude by identifying the open challenges in bridging the gap between theoretical guarantees and practical validation, advocating for hybrid architectures and standardized benchmarking to transition contingency planning from formulation to certifiable real-world deployment.

Title: Analysis of Sensing in OFDM-based ISAC under the Influence of Sampling Jitter
Authors: Lucas Giroto, Ândrei Camponogara, Yueheng Li, Jiayi Chen, Lukas Sigg, Thomas Zwick, Benjamin Nuss
Abstract: To enable integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in cellular networks, a wide range of additional requirements and challenges are either imposed or become more critical. One such impairment is sampling jitter (SJ), which arises due to imperfections in the sampling instants of the clocks of digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). While SJ is already well studied for communication systems based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), which is expected to be the waveform of choice for most sixth-generation (6G) scenarios where ISAC could be possible, the implications of SJ on the OFDM-based radar sensing must still be thoroughly analyzed. Considering that phase-locked loop (PLL)-based oscillators are used to derive sampling clocks, which leads to colored SJ, i.e., SJ with non-flat power spectral density, this article analyzes the resulting distortion of the adopted digital constellation modulation and sensing performance in OFDM-based ISAC for both baseband (BB) and bandpass (BP) sampling strategies and different oversampling factors. For BB sampling, it is seen that SJ induces intercarrier interference (ICI), while for BP sampling, it causes carrier phase error and more severe ICI due to a phase noise-like effect at the digital intermediate frequency. Obtained results for a single-input single-output OFDM-based ISAC system with various OFDM signal parameterizations demonstrate that SJ-induced degradation becomes non-negligible for both BB and BP sampling only for root mean square (RMS) SJ values above 10^-11 s at both DAC and ADC, which corresponds to 0.5*10^-2 times the considered critical sampling period without oversampling. Based on the achieved results, it can be concluded that state-of-the-art hardware enables sufficient communication and sensing robustness against SJ, as RMS SJ values in the femtosecond range can be achieved.

Title: Fast-ULCNet: A fast and ultra low complexity network for single-channel speech enhancement
Authors: Nicolás Arrieta Larraza, Niels de Koeijer
Abstract: Single-channel speech enhancement algorithms are often used in resource-constrained embedded devices, where low latency and low complexity designs gain more importance. In recent years, researchers have proposed a wide variety of novel solutions to this problem. In particular, a recent deep learning model named ULCNet is among the state-of-the-art approaches in this domain. This paper proposes an adaptation of ULCNet, by replacing its GRU layers with FastGRNNs, to reduce both computational latency and complexity. Furthermore, this paper shows empirical evidence on the performance decay of FastGRNNs in long audio signals during inference due to internal state drifting, and proposes a novel approach based on a trainable complementary filter to mitigate it. The resulting model, Fast-ULCNet, performs on par with the state-of-the-art original ULCNet architecture on a speech enhancement task, while reducing its model size by more than half and decreasing its latency by 34% on average.

Title: Deep Learning assisted Port-Cycling based Channel Sounding for Precoder Estimation in Massive MIMO Arrays
Authors: Advaith Arun, Shiv Shankar, Dhivagar Baskaran, Klutto Milleth, Bhaskar Ramamurthi
Abstract: Future wireless systems are expected to employ a substantially larger number of transmit ports for channel state information (CSI) estimation compared to current specifications. Although scaling ports improves spectral efficiency, it also increases the resource overhead to transmit reference signals across the time-frequency grid, ultimately reducing achievable data throughput. In this work, we propose an deep learning (DL)-based CSI reconstruction framework that serves as an enabler for reliable CSI acquisition in future 6G systems. The proposed solution involves designing a port-cycling mechanism that sequentially sounds different portions of CSI ports across time, thereby lowering the overhead while preserving channel observability. The proposed CSI Adaptive Network (CsiAdaNet) model exploits the resulting sparse measurements and captures both spatial and temporal correlations to accurately reconstruct the full-port CSI. The simulation results show that our method achieves overhead reduction while maintaining high CSI reconstruction accuracy.

Title: Stealthy bias injection attack detection based on Kullback-Leibler divergence in stochastic linear systems
Authors: Jingwei Dong, André M. H. Teixeira
Abstract: This paper studies the design of detection observers against stealthy bias injection attacks in stochastic linear systems under Gaussian noise, considering adversaries that exploit noise and inject crafted bias signals into a subset of sensors in a slow and coordinated manner, thereby achieving malicious objectives while remaining stealthy. To address such attacks, we formulate the observer design as a max-min optimization problem to enhance the detectability of worst-case BIAs, which attain a prescribed attack impact with the least detectability evaluated via Kullback-Leibler divergence. To reduce the computational complexity of the derived non-convex design problem, we consider the detectability of worst-case BIAs at three specific time instants: attack onset, one step after attack occurrence, and the steady state. We prove that the Kalman filter is optimal for maximizing the BIA detectability at the attack onset, regardless of the subset of attacked sensors. For the one-step and steady-state cases, the observer design problems are approximated by bi-convex optimization problems, which can be efficiently solved using alternating optimization and alternating direction method of multipliers. Moreover, more tractable linear matrix inequality relaxations are developed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed stealth-aware detection framework is demonstrated through an application to a thermal system.

Title: Filtered 2D Contour-Based Reconstruction of 3D STL Model from CT-DICOM Images
Authors: K.Punnam Chandar, Y.Ravi Kumar
Abstract: Reconstructing a 3D Stereo-lithography (STL) Model from 2D Contours of scanned structure in Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) images is crucial to understand the geometry and deformity. Computed Tomography (CT) images are processed to enhance the contrast, reduce the noise followed by smoothing. The processed CT images are segmented using thresholding technique. 2D contour data points are extracted from segmented CT images and are used to construct 3D STL Models. The 2D contour data points may contain outliers as a result of segmentation of low resolution images and the geometry of the constructed 3D structure deviate from the actual. To cope with the imperfections in segmentation process, in this work we propose to use filtered 2D contour data points to reconstruct 3D STL Model. The filtered 2D contour points of each image are delaunay triangulated and joined layer-by-layer to reconstruct the 3D STL model. The 3D STL Model reconstruction is verified on i) 2D Data points of basic shapes and ii) Region of Interest (ROI) of human pelvic bone and are presented as case studies. The 3D STL model constructed from 2D contour data points of ROI of segmented pelvic bone with and without filtering are presented. The 3D STL model reconstructed from filtered 2D data points improved the geometry of model compared to the model reconstructed without filtering 2D data points.

Title: Alternative Shapes of Modulation Schemes Detailed Exposition and Simulation Methodology
Authors: Nipun Agarwal
Abstract: Modulation constellation design is a core challenge in digital communications, especially under stringent demands on spectral efficiency, robustness, and energy consumption. Classical schemes like PSK and QAM, while analytically tractable, often lose optimality under realistic channels and nonlinear hardware constraints. This paper provides a unified study of constellation design from geometric, probabilistic, optimization, and machine learning perspectives, focusing on symbol error rate (SER), fading robustness, peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), and energy efficiency. We evaluate classical, lattice-based, asymmetric, probabilistically shaped, Golden Angle, heuristic-optimized, and machine learning assisted constellations under AWGN and Rayleigh fading via large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. Incorporating PAPR-aware and power amplifier models reveals that SER-optimal designs are not always energy-optimal; small SER trade-offs can yield substantial energy savings. Machine learning approaches offer flexible joint optimization of reliability, robustness, and energy efficiency by embedding channel and hardware constraints into the learning objective.

Title: Physical Layer Security in Massive MIMO: Challenges and Open Research Directions Against Passive Eavesdroppers
Authors: Nipun Agarwal
Abstract: Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) has become a crucial enabling technology for 5G and beyond, providing previously unheard-of increases in energy and spectrum efficiency. It is still difficult to guarantee secure communication in these systems, particularly when it comes to passive eavesdroppers whose base station is unaware of their channel state information. By taking advantage of the inherent randomness of wireless channels, Physical Layer Security (PLS) offers a promising paradigm; however, its efficacy in massive MIMO is heavily reliant on resource allocation and transmission strategies. In this work, the performance of secure transmission schemes, such as Maximum Ratio Transmission (MRT), Zero-Forcing (ZF), and Artificial Noise (AN)-aided beamforming, is examined when passive eavesdroppers are present. This work will use extensive Monte Carlo simulations to assess important performance metrics such as energy efficiency, secrecy outage probability, and secrecy sum rate under different system parameters (e.g., number of antennas, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), power allocation). The results aim to provide comparative insight into the strengths and limitations of different PLS strategies and to highlight open research directions to design scalable, energy-efficient, and robust secure transmission techniques in future 6G networks.

Title: Electrical Design of a Clean Offshore Heat and Power (CleanOFF) Hub
Authors: Maiken Borud Omtveit, Qian Long, Valentin Chabaud, Marte Ruud-Olsen, Steinar Halsne, Tor-Christian Ystgaard
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative offshore solution where oil & gas platform clusters are powered by a wind farm and a hydrogen hub. The results show a feasible off-grid design as an alternative to conventional electrification solutions. To address the challenges of design and operation of such a system, a power system model of the equipment and control was developed in a power system simulator called Process Power Simulator (PPSim). Power fluctuations in the wind farm are modelled using a state-of-the-art method encompassing turbulence and wakes. Various operation scenarios were used to evaluate the system design and find the right equipment size. An expensive component to over dimension is the battery energy storage system (BESS). The BESS power rating and energy capacity were found by running a combination of scenarios with extreme and natural wind variations, and contingencies. The control strategy and ramp rates of electrolyzers have significant impact on both system performance and design. A ramp rate in the order of seconds as opposed to minutes will decrease the required BESS size by 60-70%. Choosing synchronized control of the electrolyzers can further reduce the BESS size by 15-20%. The simulations also revealed challenges to achieve self-sufficiency of hydrogen and potential design improvements are suggested.

Title: Neural Tracking of Sustained Attention, Attention Switching, and Natural Conversation in Audiovisual Environments using Mobile EEG
Authors: Johanna Wilroth, Oskar Keding, Martin A. Skoglund, Maria Sandsten, Martin Enqvist, Emina Alickovic
Abstract: Everyday communication is dynamic and multisensory, often involving shifting attention, overlapping speech and visual cues. Yet, most neural attention tracking studies are still limited to highly controlled lab settings, using clean, often audio-only stimuli and requiring sustained attention to a single talker. This work addresses that gap by introducing a novel dataset from 24 normal-hearing participants. We used a mobile electroencephalography (EEG) system (44 scalp electrodes and 20 cEEGrid electrodes) in an audiovisual (AV) paradigm with three conditions: sustained attention to a single talker in a two-talker environment, attention switching between two talkers, and unscripted two-talker conversations with a competing single talker. Analysis included temporal response functions (TRFs) modeling, optimal lag analysis, selective attention classification with decision windows ranging from 1.1s to 35s, and comparisons of TRFs for attention to AV conversations versus side audio-only talkers. Key findings show significant differences in the attention-related P2-peak between attended and ignored speech across conditions for scalp EEG. No significant change in performance between switching and sustained attention suggests robustness for attention switches. Optimal lag analysis revealed narrower peak for conversation compared to single-talker AV stimuli, reflecting the additional complexity of multi-talker processing. Classification of selective attention was consistently above chance (55-70% accuracy) for scalp EEG, while cEEGrid data yielded lower correlations, highlighting the need for further methodological improvements. These results demonstrate that mobile EEG can reliably track selective attention in dynamic, multisensory listening scenarios and provide guidance for designing future AV paradigms and real-world attention tracking applications.

Title: Instantaneous Frequency in Power Systems using the Teager-Kaiser Energy Operator
Authors: A. Vaca, J. Gutierrez Florensa, F. Milano
Abstract: This paper develops an instantaneous-frequency (IF) local estimator calculated with the complex Teager-Kaiser energy operator (CTKEO) and the dynamic-signal identity. The contribution is a novel IF expression that makes the envelope-curvature terms explicit, thus correcting the bias that affects conventional estimators used in power systems. The estimator aligns with complex-frequency (CF) kinematics and admits a geometric interpretation (curvature/torsion) without phase unwrapping. Simulations and data-driven examples demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach.

Title: Vision Models for Medical Imaging: A Hybrid Approach for PCOS Detection from Ultrasound Scans
Authors: Md Mahmudul Hoque, Md Mehedi Hassain, Muntakimur Rahaman, Md. Towhidul Islam, Shaista Rani, Md Sharif Mollah
Abstract: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the most familiar endocrine illness in women of reproductive age. Many Bangladeshi women suffer from PCOS disease in their older age. The aim of our research is to identify effective vision-based medical image analysis techniques and evaluate hybrid models for the accurate detection of PCOS. We introduced two novel hybrid models combining convolutional and transformer-based approaches. The training and testing data were organized into two categories: "infected" (PCOS-positive) and "noninfected" (healthy ovaries). In the initial stage, our first hybrid model, 'DenConST' (integrating DenseNet121, Swin Transformer, and ConvNeXt), achieved 85.69% accuracy. The final optimized model, 'DenConREST' (incorporating Swin Transformer, ConvNeXt, DenseNet121, ResNet18, and EfficientNetV2), demonstrated superior performance with 98.23% accuracy. Among all evaluated models, DenConREST showed the best performance. This research highlights an efficient solution for PCOS detection from ultrasound images, significantly improving diagnostic accuracy while reducing detection errors.

Title: Sparse Sensor Arrays for Active Sensing: Models, Configurations and Applications
Authors: Robin Rajamäki, Visa Koivunen
Abstract: This chapter focuses on active sensing using sparse arrays. In active sensing applications, such as radar, sonar, wireless communications, and medical ultrasound, a collection of sensors probes the environment by emitting self-generated energy. A key benefit of such active multi-sensor arrays is their ability to focus and steer energy in desired directions by beamforming on transmit. Sparse sensor arrays offer several advantages over conventional uniform arrays, including improved resolution using fewer physical sensors and the capability to identify more scatterers than sensors. This is facilitated by the effective transmit-receive virtual array known as the sum co-array, which can have many more virtual sensors than the number of physical transmit or receive sensors. Herein, we focus on the design of low-redundancy sparse array configurations and on employing transmit-receive (Tx-Rx) beamforming using sparse arrays. We discuss the optimal, but computationally intractable Minimum-redundancy array, and a scalable symmetric array framework, which extends many well-known passive sparse array geometries to the active case. We also examine mitigating side lobes arising from spatial undersampling by a synthetic beamforming method known as image addition. We briefly present approaches for finding the physical beamforming weights synthesizing a desired Tx-Rx beampattern, and consider related spatio-temporal trade-offs. We conclude by discussing selected applications of sparse arrays in active sensing.

Title: Stochastic EMS for Optimal 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy Operations
Authors: Natanon Tongamrak, Kannapha Amaruchkul, Wijarn Wangdee, Jitkomut Songsiri
Abstract: This paper proposes a two-stage stochastic optimization formulation to determine optimal operation and procurement plans for achieving a 24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE) compliance at minimized cost. The system in consideration follows primary energy technologies in Thailand including solar power, battery storage, and a diverse portfolio of renewable and carbon-based energy procurement sources. Unlike existing literature focused on long-term planning, this study addresses near real-time operations using a 15-minute resolution. A novel feature of the formulation is the explicit treatment of CFE compliance as a model parameter, enabling flexible targets such as a minimum percentage of hourly matching or a required number of carbon-free days within a multi-day horizon. The mixed-integer linear programming formulation accounts for uncertainties in load and solar generation by integrating deep learning-based forecasting within a receding horizon framework. By optimizing battery profiles and multi-source procurement simultaneously, the proposed system provides a feasible pathway for transitioning to carbon-free operations in emerging energy markets.

Title: Weather Estimation for Integrated Sensing and Communication
Authors: Victoria Palhares, Artjom Grudnitsky, Silvio Mandelli
Abstract: One of the key features of sixth generation (6G) mobile communications will be integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). While the main goal of ISAC in standardization efforts is to detect objects, the byproducts of radar operations can be used to enable new services in 6G, such as weather sensing. Even though weather radars are the most prominent technology for weather detection and monitoring, they are expensive and usually neglect areas in close vicinity. To this end, we propose reusing the dense deployment of 6G base stations for weather sensing purposes by detecting and estimating weather conditions. We implement both a classifier and a regressor as a convolutional neural network trained across measurements with varying precipitation rates and wind speeds. We implement our approach in an ISAC proof-of-concept, and conduct a multi-week experiment campaign. Experimental results show that we are able to jointly and accurately classify weather conditions with accuracies of 99.38% and 98.99% for precipitation rate and wind speed, respectively. For estimation, we obtain errors of 1.2 mm/h and 1.5 km/h, for precipitation rate and wind speed, respectively. These findings indicate that weather sensing services can be reliably deployed in 6G ISAC networks, broadening their service portfolio and boosting their market value.

Title: TTCBF: A Truncated Taylor Control Barrier Function for High-Order Safety Constraints
Authors: Jianye Xu, Bassam Alrifaee
Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) enforce safety by rendering a prescribed safe set forward invariant. However, standard CBFs are limited to safety constraints with relative degree one, while High-Order CBF (HOCBF) methods address higher relative degree at the cost of introducing a chain of auxiliary functions and multiple class K functions whose tuning scales with the relative degree. In this paper, we introduce a Truncated Taylor Control Barrier Function (TTCBF), which generalizes standard discrete-time CBFs to consider high-order safety constraints and requires only one class K function, independent of the relative degree. We also propose an adaptive variant, adaptive TTCBF (aTTCBF), that optimizes an online gain on the class K function to improve adaptability, while requiring fewer control design parameters than existing adaptive HOCBF variants. Numerical experiments in a relative-degree-six spring-mass system and a cluttered corridor navigation validate the above theoretical findings.

Title: Machine Learning Decoder for 5G NR PUCCH Format 0
Authors: Anil Kumar Yerrapragada, Jeeva Keshav S, Ankit Gautam, Radha Krishna Ganti
Abstract: 5G cellular systems depend on the timely exchange of feedback control information between the user equipment and the base station. Proper decoding of this control information is necessary to set up and sustain high throughput radio links. This paper makes the first attempt at using Machine Learning techniques to improve the decoding performance of the Physical Uplink Control Channel Format 0. We use fully connected neural networks to classify the received samples based on the uplink control information content embedded within them. The trained neural network, tested on real-time wireless captures, shows significant improvement in accuracy over conventional DFT-based decoders, even at low SNR. The obtained accuracy results also demonstrate conformance with 3GPP requirements.

Title: A Cloud-Based Cross-Modal Transformer for Emotion Recognition and Adaptive Human-Computer Interaction
Authors: Ziwen Zhong, Zhitao Shu, Yue Zhao
Abstract: Emotion recognition is a fundamental component of next-generation human-computer interaction (HCI), enabling machines to perceive, understand, and respond to users' affective states. However, existing systems often rely on single-modality analysis such as facial expressions, speech tone, or textual sentiment, resulting in limited robustness and poor generalization in real-world environments. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Cloud-Based Cross-Modal Transformer (CMT) framework for multimodal emotion recognition and adaptive human-computer interaction. The proposed model integrates visual, auditory, and textual signals using pretrained encoders (Vision Transformer, Wav2Vec2, and BERT) and employs a cross-modal attention mechanism to capture complex interdependencies among heterogeneous features. By leveraging cloud computing infrastructure with distributed training on Kubernetes and TensorFlow Serving, the system enables scalable, low-latency emotion recognition for large-scale user interactions. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets including IEMOCAP, MELD, and AffectNet demonstrate that the CMT achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving the F1-score by 3.0 percent and reducing cross-entropy loss by 12.9 percent compared to strong multimodal baselines. Additionally, cloud deployment evaluations show an average response latency of 128 ms, representing a 35 percent reduction compared with conventional transformer-based fusion systems. These results confirm that the proposed framework enables efficient, real-time emotion recognition and adaptive feedback in applications such as intelligent customer service, virtual tutoring systems, and affective computing interfaces, marking an important step toward cloud-native affective computing and emotionally intelligent interactive systems.

Title: Call2Instruct: Automated Pipeline for Generating Q&A Datasets from Call Center Recordings for LLM Fine-Tuning
Authors: Alex Echeverria, Sávio Salvarino Teles de Oliveira, Fernando Marques Federson
Abstract: The adaptation of Large-Scale Language Models (LLMs) to specific domains depends on high-quality fine-tuning datasets, particularly in instructional format (e.g., Question-Answer - Q&A). However, generating these datasets, particularly from unstructured sources such as call center audio recordings, poses a significant challenge due to the noisy and disorganized nature of the data. This paper presents a solution to this challenge by offering an end-to-end automated pipeline for generating Q&A instructional datasets from such recordings. The methodology developed comprises sequential steps of audio processing (including diarization, noise removal and automatic transcription), textual processing (cleaning, normalization, and anonymization), semantic extraction of customer demands and attendant responses using vector embeddings, and matching via semantic search to form the final Q&A pairs. As a result, the complete pipeline was successfully implemented, generating a dataset specifically formatted for Instruct Fine Tuning. The practical value and feasibility of the generated dataset were substantiated and functionally demonstrated through the successful fine-tuning of an LLM model (based on Llama 2 7B). The conclusion of the paper states that the proposed approach is viable for converting unstructured conversational data from call centers into valuable resources for training LLMs. This development has the potential to open up avenues for creating more effective AI systems for Q&A tasks in the customer service domain. The developed codes have been made publicly available to promote reproducibility and future research.

Title: Guided by the Plan: Enhancing Faithful Autoregressive Text-to-Audio Generation with Guided Decoding
Authors: Juncheng Wang, Zhe Hu, Chao Xu, Siyue Ren, Yuxiang Feng, Yang Liu, Baigui Sun, Shujun Wang
Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models excel at generating temporally coherent audio by producing tokens sequentially, yet they often falter in faithfully following complex textual prompts, especially those describing complex sound events. We uncover a surprising capability in AR audio generators: their early prefix tokens implicitly encode global semantic attributes of the final output, such as event count and sound-object category, revealing a form of implicit planning. Building on this insight, we propose Plan-Critic, a lightweight auxiliary model trained with a Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)-inspired objective to predict final instruction-following quality from partial generations. At inference time, Plan-Critic enables guided exploration: it evaluates candidate prefixes early, prunes low-fidelity trajectories, and reallocates computation to high-potential planning seeds. Our Plan-Critic-guided sampling achieves up to a 10-point improvement in CLAP score over the AR baseline-establishing a new state of the art in AR text-to-audio generation-while maintaining computational parity with standard best-of-N decoding. This work bridges the gap between causal generation and global semantic alignment, demonstrating that even strictly autoregressive models can plan ahead.

Title: VCSEL-based CPO for Scale-Up in A.I. Datacenter. Status and Perspectives
Authors: Manuel Kohli, Jean Teissier
Abstract: The drastic increase of bandwidth demands in AI datacenters requires new solutions with low power consumption and high bandwidth densities. Further increasing the total bandwidth with copper interconnects is challenging, thus it is crucial to introduce optics into the scale-up network. For this purpose, the most important metrics are the energy efficiency of the total link in addition to the spatial bandwidth-density and reach. With the inefficiency of copper traces at high speeds, transitioning to co-packaged optics is no longer optional but essential. Here, we show that the mature VCSEL technology offers the ideal combination of low-cost, low-latency, high-reliability, and energy efficiency at all bitrates, thanks to their unique versatility and high wall-plug-efficiency. This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication. Copyright may be transferred without notice, after which this version may no longer be accessible.

Title: Rethinking On-Device LLM Reasoning: Why Analogical Mapping Outperforms Abstract Thinking for IoT DDoS Detection
Authors: William Pan, Guiran Liu, Binrong Zhu, Qun Wang, Yingzhou Lu, Beiyu Lin, Rose Qingyang Hu
Abstract: The rapid expansion of IoT deployments has intensified cybersecurity threats, notably Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, characterized by increasingly sophisticated patterns. Leveraging Generative AI through On-Device Large Language Models (ODLLMs) provides a viable solution for real-time threat detection at the network edge, though limited computational resources present challenges for smaller ODLLMs. This paper introduces a novel detection framework that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), tailored specifically for IoT edge environments. We systematically evaluate compact ODLLMs, including LLaMA 3.2 (1B, 3B) and Gemma 3 (1B, 4B), using structured prompting and exemplar-driven reasoning strategies. Experimental results demonstrate substantial performance improvements with few-shot prompting, achieving macro-average F1 scores as high as 0.85. Our findings highlight the significant advantages of incorporating exemplar-based reasoning, underscoring that CoT and RAG approaches markedly enhance small ODLLMs' capabilities in accurately classifying complex network attacks under stringent resource constraints.

Title: Large-Scale Label Quality Assessment for Medical Segmentation via a Vision-Language Judge and Synthetic Data
Authors: Yixiong Chen, Zongwei Zhou, Wenxuan Li, Alan Yuille
Abstract: Large-scale medical segmentation datasets often combine manual and pseudo-labels of uneven quality, which can compromise training and evaluation. Low-quality labels may hamper performance and make the model training less robust. To address this issue, we propose SegAE (Segmentation Assessment Engine), a lightweight vision-language model (VLM) that automatically predicts label quality across 142 anatomical structures. Trained on over four million image-label pairs with quality scores, SegAE achieves a high correlation coefficient of 0.902 with ground-truth Dice similarity and evaluates a 3D mask in 0.06s. SegAE shows several practical benefits: (I) Our analysis reveals widespread low-quality labeling across public datasets; (II) SegAE improves data efficiency and training performance in active and semi-supervised learning, reducing dataset annotation cost by one-third and quality-checking time by 70% per label. This tool provides a simple and effective solution for quality control in large-scale medical segmentation datasets. The dataset, model weights, and codes are released at this https URL.

Title: $π$MPC: A Parallel-in-horizon and Construction-free NMPC Solver
Authors: Liang Wu, Bo Yang, Xu Yang, Yilin Mo, Yang Shi, Ján Drgoňa
Abstract: The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has gained increasing popularity in embedded model predictive control (MPC) due to its code simplicity and pain-free parameter selection. However, existing ADMM solvers either target general quadratic programming (QP) problems or exploit sparse MPC formulations via Riccati recursions, which are inherently sequential and therefore difficult to parallelize for long prediction horizons. This technical note proposes a novel \textit{parallel-in-horizon} and \textit{construction-free} nonlinear MPC algorithm, termed $\pi$MPC, which combines a new variable-splitting scheme with a velocity-based system representation in the ADMM framework, enabling horizon-wise parallel execution while operating directly on system matrices without explicit MPC-to-QP construction. Numerical experiments and accompanying code are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: Event-Triggered Newton Extremum Seeking for Multivariable Optimization
Authors: Victor Hugo Pereira Rodrigues, Tiago Roux Oliveira, Miroslav Krstic, Paulo Tabuada
Abstract: This paper presents a static event-triggered control strategy for multivariable Newton-based extremum seeking. The proposed method integrates event-triggered actuation into the Newton-based optimization framework to reduce control updates while maintaining rapid convergence to the extremum. Unlike traditional gradient-based extremum seeking, where the convergence rate depends on the unknown Hessian of the cost function, the proposed approach employs a dynamic estimator of the Hessian inverse, formulated as a Riccati equation, enabling user-assignable convergence rates. The event-triggering mechanism is designed to minimize unnecessary actuation updates while preserving stability and performance. Using averaging theory, we establish local stability results and exponential convergence to a neighborhood of the unknown extremum point. Additionally, numerical simulations illustrate the benefits of the proposed approach over gradient-based and continuously actuated Newton-based extremum seeking, showing improved convergence rates and reduced control update frequency, leading to more efficient implementation in real-time optimization scenarios.

Title: XD-MAP: Cross-Modal Domain Adaptation using Semantic Parametric Mapping
Authors: Frank Bieder, Hendrik Königshof, Haohao Hu, Fabian Immel, Yinzhe Shen, Jan-Hendrik Pauls, Christoph Stiller
Abstract: Until open-world foundation models match the performance of specialized approaches, the effectiveness of deep learning models remains heavily dependent on dataset availability. Training data must align not only with the target object categories but also with the sensor characteristics and modalities. To bridge the gap between available datasets and deployment domains, domain adaptation strategies are widely used. In this work, we propose a novel approach to transferring sensor-specific knowledge from an image dataset to LiDAR, an entirely different sensing domain. Our method XD-MAP leverages detections from a neural network on camera images to create a semantic parametric map. The map elements are modeled to produce pseudo labels in the target domain without any manual annotation effort. Unlike previous domain transfer approaches, our method does not require direct overlap between sensors and enables extending the angular perception range from a front-view camera to a full 360 view. On our large-scale road feature dataset, XD-MAP outperforms single shot baseline approaches by +19.5 mIoU for 2D semantic segmentation, +19.5 PQth for 2D panoptic segmentation, and +32.3 mIoU in 3D semantic segmentation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach achieving strong performance on LiDAR data without any manual labeling.

Title: Specifying and Verifying RDMA Synchronisation (Extended Version)
Authors: Guillaume Ambal, Max Stupple, Brijesh Dongol, Azalea Raad
Abstract: Remote direct memory access (RDMA) allows a machine to directly read from and write to the memory of remote machine, enabling high-throughput, low-latency data transfer. Ensuring correctness of RDMA programs has only recently become possible with the formalisation of $\text{RDMA}^\text{TSO}$ semantics (describing the behaviour of RDMA networking over a TSO CPU). However, this semantics currently lacks a formalisation of remote synchronisation, meaning that the implementations of common abstractions such as locks cannot be verified. In this paper, we close this gap by presenting $\text{RDMA}^{\text{TSO}}_{\text{RMW}}$, the first semantics for remote `read-modify-write' (RMW) instructions over TSO. It turns out that remote RMW operations are weak and only ensure atomicity against other remote RMWs. We therefore build a set of composable synchronisation abstractions starting with the $\text{RDMA}^{\text{WAIT}}_{\text{RMW}}$ library. Underpinned by $\text{RDMA}^{\text{WAIT}}_{\text{RMW}}$, we then specify, implement and verify three classes of remote locks that are suitable for different scenarios. Additionally, we develop the notion of a strong RDMA model, $\text{RDMA}^{\text{SC}}_{\text{RMW}}$, which is akin to sequential consistency in shared memory architectures. Our libraries are built to be compatible with an existing set of high-performance libraries called LOCO, which ensures compositionality and verifiability.

Title: Unlocking Large Audio-Language Models for Interactive Language Learning
Authors: Hongfu Liu, Zhouying Cui, Xiangming Gu, Ye Wang
Abstract: Achieving pronunciation proficiency in a second language (L2) remains a challenge, despite the development of Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) systems. Traditional CAPT systems often provide unintuitive feedback that lacks actionable guidance, limiting its effectiveness. Recent advancements in audio-language models (ALMs) offer the potential to enhance these systems by providing more user-friendly feedback. In this work, we investigate ALMs for chat-based pronunciation training by introducing L2-Arctic-plus, an English dataset with detailed error explanations and actionable suggestions for improvement. We benchmark cascaded ASR+LLMs and existing ALMs on this dataset, specifically in detecting mispronunciation and generating actionable feedback. To improve the performance, we further propose to instruction-tune ALMs on L2-Arctic-plus. Experimental results demonstrate that our instruction-tuned models significantly outperform existing baselines on mispronunciation detection and suggestion generation in terms of both objective and human evaluation, highlighting the value of the proposed dataset.

Title: Blended Dynamics and Emergence in Open Quantum Networks
Authors: Qinghao Wen, Zihao Ren, Lei Wang, Hyungbo Shim, Guodong Shi
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a blended dynamics framework for open quantum networks with diffusive couplings. The network consists of qubits interconnected through Hamiltonian couplings, environmental dissipation, and consensus-like diffusive interactions. Such networks commonly arise in spontaneous emission processes and non-Hermitian quantum computing, and their evolution follows a Lindblad master equation. Blended dynamics theory is well established in the classical setting as a tool for analyzing emergent behaviors in heterogeneous networks with diffusive couplings. Its key insight is to blend the local dynamics rather than the trajectories of individual nodes. Perturbation analysis then shows that, under sufficiently strong coupling, all node trajectories tend to stay close to those of the blended system over time. We first show that this theory extends naturally to the reduced-state dynamics of quantum networks, revealing classical-like clustering phenomena in which qubits converge to a shared equilibrium or a common trajectory determined by the quantum blended reduced-state dynamics. We then extend the analysis to qubit coherent states using quantum Laplacians and induced graphs, proving orbit attraction of the network density operator toward the quantum blended coherent dynamics, establishing the emergence of intrinsically quantum and dynamically clustering behaviors. Finally, numerical examples validate the theoretical results.

Title: Practical prescribed-time prescribed performance control with asymptotic convergence - A vanishing sigma-modification approach
Authors: Mehdi Golestani, Yongduan Song, Weizhen Liu, Guangren Duan, He Kong
Abstract: In this paper, we present a method capable of ensuring practical prescribed-time control with guaranteed performance for a class of nonlinear systems in the presence of time-varying parametric and dynamic uncertainties, and uncertain control coefficients. Our design consists of two key steps. First, we construct a performance-rate function that freezes at and after a user-specified time T, playing a crucial role in achieving desired precision within prescribed time T and dealing with unmodeled dynamics. Next, based on this function and a sigma-modification strategy in which the leakage term starts to vanish at t > T, we develop an adaptive dynamic surface control framework to reduce control complexity, deal with uncertainties, ensure prescribed performance, practical prescribed-time convergence to a specific region, and ultimately achieve asymptotic convergence. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is validated through numerical simulations.

Title: Rank-one Riemannian Subspace Descent for Nonlinear Matrix Equations
Authors: Yogesh Darmwal, Ketan Rajawat
Abstract: We propose a rank-one Riemannian subspace descent algorithm for computing symmetric positive definite (SPD) solutions to nonlinear matrix equations arising in control theory, dynamic programming, and stochastic filtering. For solution matrices of size $n\times n$, standard approaches for dense matrix equations typically incur $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ cost per-iteration, while the efficient $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ methods either rely on sparsity or low-rank solutions, or have iteration counts that scale poorly. The proposed method entails updating along the dominant eigen-component of a transformed Riemannian gradient, identified using at most $\mathcal{O}(\log(n))$ power iterations. The update structure also enables exact step-size selection in many cases at minimal additional cost. For objectives defined as compositions of standard matrix operations, each iteration can be implemented using only matrix--vector products, yielding $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ arithmetic cost. We prove an $\mathcal{O}(n)$ iteration bound under standard smoothness assumptions, with improved bounds under geodesic strong convexity. Numerical experiments on large-scale CARE, DARE, and other nonlinear matrix equations show that the proposed algorithm solves instances (up to $n=10{,}000$ in our tests) for which the compared solvers, including MATLAB's \texttt{icare}, structure-preserving doubling, and subspace-descent baselines fail to return a solution. These results demonstrate that rank-one manifold updates provide a practical approach for high-dimensional and dense SPD-constrained matrix equations.

Title: Communication-Efficient Multi-Modal Edge Inference via Uncertainty-Aware Distributed Learning
Authors: Hang Zhao, Hongru Li, Dongfang Xu, Shenghui Song, Khaled B. Letaief
Abstract: Semantic communication is emerging as a key enabler for distributed edge intelligence due to its capability to convey task-relevant meaning. However, achieving communication-efficient training and robust inference over wireless links remains challenging. This challenge is further exacerbated for multi-modal edge inference (MMEI) by two factors: 1) prohibitive communication overhead for distributed learning over bandwidth-limited wireless links, due to the \emph{multi-modal} nature of the system; and 2) limited robustness under varying channels and noisy multi-modal inputs. In this paper, we propose a three-stage communication-aware distributed learning framework to improve training and inference efficiency while maintaining robustness over wireless channels. In Stage~I, devices perform local multi-modal self-supervised learning to obtain shared and modality-specific encoders without device--server exchange, thereby reducing the communication cost. In Stage~II, distributed fine-tuning with centralized evidential fusion calibrates per-modality uncertainty and reliably aggregates features distorted by noise or channel fading. In Stage~III, an uncertainty-guided feedback mechanism selectively requests additional features for uncertain samples, optimizing the communication--accuracy tradeoff in the distributed setting. Experiments on RGB--depth indoor scene classification show that the proposed framework attains higher accuracy with far fewer training communication rounds and remains robust to modality degradation or channel variation, outperforming existing self-supervised and fully supervised baselines.

Title: VCNAC: A Variable-Channel Neural Audio Codec for Mono, Stereo, and Surround Sound
Authors: Florian Grötschla, Arunasish Sen, Alessandro Lombardi, Guillermo Cámbara, Andreas Schwarz
Abstract: We present VCNAC, a variable channel neural audio codec. Our approach features a single encoder and decoder parametrization that enables native inference for different channel setups, from mono speech to cinematic 5.1 channel surround audio. Channel compatibility objectives ensure that multi-channel content maintains perceptual quality when decoded to fewer channels. The shared representation enables training of generative language models on a single set of codebooks while supporting inference-time scalability across modalities and channel configurations. Evaluation using objective spatial audio metrics and subjective listening tests demonstrates that our unified approach maintains high reconstruction quality across mono, stereo, and surround audio configurations.

Title: The Responsibility Vacuum: Organizational Failure in Scaled Agent Systems
Authors: Oleg Romanchuk, Roman Bondar
Abstract: Modern CI/CD pipelines integrating agent-generated code exhibit a structural failure in responsibility attribution. Decisions are executed through formally correct approval processes, yet no entity possesses both the authority to approve those decisions and the epistemic capacity to meaningfully understand their basis. We define this condition as responsibility vacuum: a state in which decisions occur, but responsibility cannot be attributed because authority and verification capacity do not coincide. We show that this is not a process deviation or technical defect, but a structural property of deployments where decision generation throughput exceeds bounded human verification capacity. We identify a scaling limit under standard deployment assumptions, including parallel agent generation, CI-based validation, and individualized human approval gates. Beyond a throughput threshold, verification ceases to function as a decision criterion and is replaced by ritualized approval based on proxy signals. Personalized responsibility becomes structurally unattainable in this regime. We further characterize a CI amplification dynamic, whereby increasing automated validation coverage raises proxy signal density without restoring human capacity. Under fixed time and attention constraints, this accelerates cognitive offloading in the broad sense and widens the gap between formal approval and epistemic understanding. Additional automation therefore amplifies, rather than mitigates, the responsibility vacuum. We conclude that unless organizations explicitly redesign decision boundaries or reassign responsibility away from individual decisions toward batch- or system-level ownership, responsibility vacuum remains an invisible but persistent failure mode in scaled agent deployments.

Title: Field-Space Autoencoder for Scalable Climate Emulators
Authors: Johannes Meuer, Maximilian Witte, Étiénne Plésiat, Thomas Ludwig, Christopher Kadow
Abstract: Kilometer-scale Earth system models are essential for capturing local climate change. However, these models are computationally expensive and produce petabyte-scale outputs, which limits their utility for applications such as probabilistic risk assessment. Here, we present the Field-Space Autoencoder, a scalable climate emulation framework based on a spherical compression model that overcomes these challenges. By utilizing Field-Space Attention, the model efficiently operates on native climate model output and therefore avoids geometric distortions caused by forcing spherical data onto Euclidean grids. This approach preserves physical structures significantly better than convolutional baselines. By producing a structured compressed field, it serves as a good baseline for downstream generative emulation. In addition, the model can perform zero-shot super-resolution that maps low-resolution large ensembles and scarce high-resolution data into a shared representation. We train a generative diffusion model on these compressed fields. The model can simultaneously learn internal variability from abundant low-resolution data and fine-scale physics from sparse high-resolution data. Our work bridges the gap between the high volume of low-resolution ensemble statistics and the scarcity of high-resolution physical detail.

Title: WeDefense: A Toolkit to Defend Against Fake Audio
Authors: Lin Zhang, Johan Rohdin, Xin Wang, Junyi Peng, Tianchi Liu, You Zhang, Hieu-Thi Luong, Shuai Wang, Chengdong Liang, Anna Silnova, Nicholas Evans
Abstract: The advances in generative AI have enabled the creation of synthetic audio which is perceptually indistinguishable from real, genuine audio. Although this stellar progress enables many positive applications, it also raises risks of misuse, such as for impersonation, disinformation and fraud. Despite a growing number of open-source fake audio detection codes released through numerous challenges and initiatives, most are tailored to specific competitions, datasets or models. A standardized and unified toolkit that supports the fair benchmarking and comparison of competing solutions with not just common databases, protocols, metrics, but also a shared codebase, is missing. To address this, we propose WeDefense, the first open-source toolkit to support both fake audio detection and localization. Beyond model training, WeDefense emphasizes critical yet often overlooked components: flexible input and augmentation, calibration, score fusion, standardized evaluation metrics, and analysis tools for deeper understanding and interpretation. The toolkit is publicly available at this https URL with interactive demos for fake audio detection and localization.

Title: Weakly-supervised segmentation using inherently-explainable classification models and their application to brain tumour classification
Authors: Soumick Chatterjee, Hadya Yassin, Florian Dubost, Andreas Nürnberger, Oliver Speck
Abstract: Deep learning has demonstrated significant potential in medical imaging; however, the opacity of "black-box" models hinders clinical trust, while segmentation tasks typically necessitate labourious, hard-to-obtain pixel-wise annotations. To address these challenges simultaneously, this paper introduces a framework for three inherently explainable classifiers (GP-UNet, GP-ShuffleUNet, and GP-ReconResNet). By integrating a global pooling mechanism, these networks generate localisation heatmaps that directly influence classification decisions, offering inherent interpretability without relying on potentially unreliable post-hoc methods. These heatmaps are subsequently thresholded to achieve weakly-supervised segmentation, requiring only image-level classification labels for training. Validated on two datasets for multi-class brain tumour classification, the proposed models achieved a peak F1-score of 0.93. For the weakly-supervised segmentation task, a median Dice score of 0.728 (95% CI 0.715-0.739) was recorded. Notably, on a subset of tumour-only images, the best model achieved an accuracy of 98.7%, outperforming state-of-the-art glioma grading binary classifiers. Furthermore, comparative Precision-Recall analysis validated the framework's robustness against severe class imbalance, establishing a direct correlation between diagnostic confidence and segmentation fidelity. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework successfully combines high diagnostic accuracy with essential transparency, offering a promising direction for trustworthy clinical decision support.

Title: SRFS: Parallel Processing Fault-tolerant ROS2-based Flight Software for the Space Ranger CubeSat
Authors: Zebei Zhao, Yinghao Xiang, Ziyu Zhou, Kehan Chong, Haoran Ma, Pei Chen
Abstract: Traditional Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) often suffer from limited parallel performance, whereas thread monitoring in Linux-based systems remains challenging. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a satellite flight software system design based on the Robot Operating System (ROS), which utilizes its reliable built-in publish-subscribe messaging mechanism to facilitate inter-application communication. In response to the complex functional demands of modern small satellites, the proposed design integrates both hardware and software architectures, along with system scheduling and error-correction strategies. This integration supports efficient parallel data processing, enhances system reliability, and shortens the development cycle through code reuse. The system was rigorously evaluated through comprehensive tests covering time delay, system management, fault tolerance, and maintenance procedures. Experimental results confirm the system's effectiveness in telemetry, remote control, integration of new features, and autonomous error recovery. The findings underscore the high reliability and maintainability of the ROS-based satellite flight software, offering a valuable reference for the rapid development of high-performance small satellite systems.

Title: Exact Covariance Characterization for Controlled Linear Systems subject to Stochastic Parametric and Additive Uncertainties
Authors: Kaouther Moussa, Mirko Fiacchini
Abstract: This work addresses the exact characterization of the covariance dynamics related to linear discrete-time systems subject to both additive and parametric stochastic uncertainties that are potentially unbounded. Using this characterization, the problem of control design for state covariance dynamics is addressed, providing conditions that are conservative yet more tractable compared to standard necessary and sufficient ones for the same class of systems. Numerical results assess this new characterization by comparing it to the empirical covariance and illustrate the control design problem.

Title: Single-Satellite-Based Geolocation of Broadcast GNSS Spoofers from Low Earth Orbit
Authors: Zachary L. Clements, Patrick B. Ellis, Iain Goodridge, Matthew J. Murrian, Mark L. Psiaki, Todd E. Humphreys
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis and experimental demonstration of single-satellite single-pass geolocation of a terrestrial broadcast Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) spoofer from Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The proliferation of LEO-based GNSS receivers offers the prospect of unprecedented spectrum awareness, enabling persistent GNSS interference detection and geolocation. Accurate LEO-based single-receiver emitter geolocation is possible when a range-rate time history can be extracted for the emitter. This paper presents a technique crafted specifically for indiscriminate broadcast-type GNSS spoofing signals. Furthermore, it explores how unmodeled oscillator instability and worst-case spoofer-introduced signal variations degrade the geolocation estimate. The proposed geolocation technique is validated by a controlled experiment, in partnership with Spire Global, in which a LEO-based receiver captures broadcast GNSS spoofing signals transmitted from a known ground station on a non-GNSS frequency band.

Title: Unsupervised Variational Acoustic Clustering
Authors: Luan Vinícius Fiorio, Bruno Defraene, Johan David, Frans Widdershoven, Wim van Houtum, Ronald M. Aarts
Abstract: We propose an unsupervised variational acoustic clustering model for clustering audio data in the time-frequency domain. The model leverages variational inference, extended to an autoencoder framework, with a Gaussian mixture model as a prior for the latent space. Specifically designed for audio applications, we introduce a convolutional-recurrent variational autoencoder optimized for efficient time-frequency processing. Our experimental results considering a spoken digits dataset demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy and clustering performance compared to traditional methods, showcasing the model's enhanced ability to capture complex audio patterns.

Title: Categorical Unsupervised Variational Acoustic Clustering
Authors: Luan Vinícius Fiorio, Ivana Nikoloska, Ronald M. Aarts
Abstract: We propose a categorical approach for unsupervised variational acoustic clustering of audio data in the time-frequency domain. The consideration of a categorical distribution enforces sharper clustering even when data points strongly overlap in time and frequency, which is the case for most datasets of urban acoustic scenes. To this end, we use a Gumbel-Softmax distribution as a soft approximation to the categorical distribution, allowing for training via backpropagation. In this settings, the softmax temperature serves as the main mechanism to tune clustering performance. The results show that the proposed model can obtain impressive clustering performance for all considered datasets, even when data points strongly overlap in time and frequency.

Title: A Dynamic Prognostic Prediction Method for Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastasis
Authors: Wei Yang, Yiran Zhu, Yan su, Zesheng Li, Chengchang Pan, Honggang Qi
Abstract: Colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) exhibits high postoperative recurrence and pronounced prognostic heterogeneity, challenging individualized management. Existing prognostic approaches often rely on static representations from a single postoperative snapshot, and fail to jointly capture tumor spatial distribution, longitudinal disease dynamics, and multimodal clinical information, limiting predictive accuracy. We propose DyPro, a deep learning framework that infers postoperative latent trajectories via residual dynamic evolution. Starting from an initial patient representation, DyPro generates a 12-step sequence of trajectory snapshots through autoregressive residual updates and integrates them to predict recurrence and survival outcomes. On the MSKCC CRLM dataset, DyPro achieves strong discrimination under repeated stratified 5-fold cross-validation, reaching a C-index of 0.755 for OS and 0.714 for DFS, with OS AUC@1y of 0.920 and OS IBS of 0.143. DyPro provides quantitative risk cues to support adjuvant therapy planning and follow-up scheduling.

Title: Two-Level Distributed Interference Management for Large-Scale HAPS-Empowered vHetNets
Authors: Afsoon Alidadi Shamsabadi, Animesh Yadav, Halim Yanikomeroglu
Abstract: High altitude platform stations (HAPS) offer a promising solution for achieving ubiquitous connectivity in next-generation wireless networks (xG). Integrating HAPS with terrestrial networks, creating HAPS-empowered vertical heterogeneous networks (vHetNets), significantly improves coverage and capacity and supports emerging novel use cases. In HAPS-empowered vHetNets, HAPS and terrestrial network tiers can share the same spectrum, forming harmonized spectrum vHetNets that enhance spectral efficiency (SE). However, harmonized spectrum vHetNets face major challenges, including severe co-channel interference and scalability in large-scale deployments. To address the first challenge, we adopt a cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network architecture in which users are simultaneously served by multiple base stations using beamforming. However, beamforming weight design leads to a nonconvex, high-dimensional optimization problem, highlighting the scalability challenge. To address this second challenge, we develop a two-level distributed proportional fairness beamforming weight design (PFBWD) algorithm. This algorithm combines the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) with a three-block ADMM framework. Simulation results demonstrate the performance improvements achieved by integrating HAPS with standalone terrestrial networks, as well as the reduced complexity and signaling overhead of the distributed algorithm compared to centralized algorithms.

Title: Asynchronous Grid Connections Providing Fast-Frequency Response: System Integration Study
Authors: Felix Wald, Amir Sajadi, Barry Mather, Giovanni De Carne
Abstract: This paper presents an integration study for a power electronic-based fast-frequency response technology, an asynchronous grid connection operating as an aggregator for behindthe-meter resources and distributed generators. Both technical feasibility and techno-economic viability studies are presented. The dynamic performance of the fast-frequency response enabled by the asynchronous grid connection is validated with Power Hardware-in-the-Loop experiments and transferred to an IEEE 9-bus system in DigSilent PowerFactory for dynamic stability analysis. We demonstrate that droop-based control enhancements to the local distributed generators could allow their aggregation to provide grid-supporting functionalities and participate in the market for ancillary services. To this end, we performed a long-term simulation embedding the system within the ancillary service market framework of PJM. The fast-frequency response regulation is subsequently used to calculate the potential revenue and project the results on a 15-year investment horizon. Finally, the techno-economic analysis concludes with recommendations for enhancements to access the full potential of distributed generators on a technical and regulatory level.

Title: Acoustic Non-Stationarity Objective Assessment with Hard Label Criteria for Supervised Learning Models
Authors: Guilherme Zucatelli, Ricardo Barioni, Gabriela Dantas
Abstract: Objective non-stationarity measures are resource intensive and impose critical limitations for real-time processing solutions. In this paper, a novel Hard Label Criteria (HLC) algorithm is proposed to generate a global non-stationarity label for acoustic signals, enabling supervised learning strategies to be trained as stationarity estimators. The HLC is first evaluated on state-of-the-art general-purpose acoustic models, demonstrating that these models capture stationarity information. Furthermore, the first-of-its-kind HLC-based Network for Acoustic Non-Stationarity Assessment (NANSA) is proposed. NANSA models outperform competing approaches, achieving up to 99% classification accuracy, while solving the computational infeasibility of traditional objective measures.

Title: Rec-RIR: Monaural Blind Room Impulse Response Identification via DNN-based Reverberant Speech Reconstruction in STFT Domain
Authors: Pengyu Wang, Xiaofei Li
Abstract: This paper presents Rec-RIR for monaural blind room impulse response (RIR) identification. Rec-RIR is developed based on the convolutive transfer function (CTF) approximation, which models reverberation effect within narrow-band filter banks in the short-time Fourier transform domain. Specifically, we propose a deep neural network (DNN) with cross-band and narrow-band blocks to estimate the CTF filter. The DNN is trained through reconstructing the noise-free reverberant speech spectra. This objective enables stable and straightforward supervised training. Subsequently, a pseudo intrusive measurement process is employed to convert the CTF filter estimate into RIR by simulating a common intrusive RIR measurement procedure. Experimental results demonstrate that Rec-RIR achieves state-of-the-art performance in both RIR identification and acoustic parameter estimation.

Title: Clustering of Acoustic Environments with Variational Autoencoders for Hearing Devices
Authors: Luan Vinícius Fiorio, Ivana Nikoloska, Wim van Houtum, Ronald M. Aarts
Abstract: Traditional acoustic environment classification relies on: i) classical signal processing algorithms, which are unable to extract meaningful representations of high-dimensional data; or on ii) supervised learning, limited by the availability of labels. Knowing that human-imposed labels do not always reflect the true structure of acoustic scenes, we explore the potential of (unsupervised) clustering of acoustic environments using variational autoencoders (VAEs). We employ a VAE model for categorical latent clustering with a Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization which can operate with a time-context windowing scheme for lower memory requirements, tailored for real-world hearing device scenarios. Additionally, general adaptations on VAE architectures for audio clustering are also proposed. The approaches are validated through the clustering of spoken digits, a simpler task where labels are meaningful, and urban soundscapes, where the recordings present strong overlap in time and frequency. While all variational methods succeeded when clustering spoken digits, only the proposed model achieved effective clustering performance on urban acoustic scenes, given its categorical nature.

Title: Performance Comparison of Joint Delay-Doppler Estimation Algorithms
Authors: Lorenz Mohr, Michael Döbereiner, Steffen Schieler, Joerg Robert, Christian Schneider, Sebastian Semper, Reiner S. Thomä
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), radar, and beamforming require real-time, high-resolution estimation algorithms to determine delay-Doppler values of specular paths within the wireless propagation channel. Our contribution is the measurement-based performance comparison of the delay-Doppler estimation between three different algorithms, comprising maximum likelihood (ML), convolutional neural network (CNN), and constant false alarm rate (CFAR) approaches. We apply these algorithms to publicly available channel data which includes two spherical targets with analytically describable delay-Doppler parameters. The comparison of the three algorithms features the target detection rate, root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of the delay-Doppler estimates, and a runtime analysis. Notably, all three algorithms demonstrate similar parameter estimation capabilities in bi-static scenarios, achieving target detection probabilities of up to 80%. Conversely, forward and backward scattering conditions pose a problem to the estimation due to strong line-of-sight (LoS) contribution, reducing the corresponding detection probability down to 0%.

Title: Omni-AVSR: Towards Unified Multimodal Speech Recognition with Large Language Models
Authors: Umberto Cappellazzo, Xubo Liu, Pingchuan Ma, Stavros Petridis, Maja Pantic
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved impressive results in speech recognition across multiple modalities, including Auditory Speech Recognition (ASR), Visual Speech Recognition (VSR), and Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR). Despite this progress, current LLM-based approaches typically address each task independently, training separate models that raise computational and deployment resource use while missing potential cross-task synergies. They also rely on fixed-rate token compression, which restricts flexibility in balancing accuracy with efficiency. These limitations highlight the need for a unified framework that can support ASR, VSR, and AVSR while enabling elastic inference. To this end, we present Omni-AVSR, a unified audio-visual LLM that combines efficient multi-granularity training with parameter-efficient adaptation. Specifically, we adapt the matryoshka representation learning paradigm to efficiently train across multiple audio and visual granularities, reducing its inherent training resource use. Furthermore, we explore three LoRA-based strategies for adapting the backbone LLM, balancing shared and task-specific specialization. Experiments on LRS2 and LRS3 show that Omni-AVSR achieves comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art baselines while training a single model at substantially lower training and deployment resource use. The model also remains robust under acoustic noise, and we analyze its scaling behavior as LLM size increases, providing insights into the trade-off between performance and efficiency.

Title: Principled Coarse-Grained Acceptance for Speculative Decoding in Speech
Authors: Moran Yanuka, Paul Dixon, Eyal Finkelshtein, Daniel Rotman, Raja Giryes
Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates autoregressive speech generation by letting a fast draft model propose tokens that a larger target model verifies. However, for speech LLMs that generate acoustic tokens, exact token matching is overly restrictive: many discrete tokens are acoustically or semantically interchangeable, reducing acceptance rates and limiting speedups. We introduce Principled Coarse-Graining (PCG), which verifies proposals at the level of Acoustic Similarity Groups (ASGs) derived from the target model's embedding space. By splitting each token's probability mass across the overlapping groups that contain it, we define an overlap-aware coarse-grained distribution and perform rejection sampling on the resulting group variable. This yields an exactness guarantee at the group level while allowing the accepted draft token to stand in for any member of the group in practice. On LibriTTS, PCG increases acceptance and throughput relative to standard speculative decoding and prior speech-specific relaxations while maintaining intelligibility and speaker similarity. These results suggest acoustically aware, group-level acceptance as a simple and general way to accelerate speech token generation while maintaining speech quality.

Title: Ultra-Strong Gradient Diffusion MRI with Self-Supervised Learning for Prostate Cancer Characterization
Authors: Tanishq Patil, Snigdha Sen, Kieran G. Foley, Fabrizio Fasano, Chantal M. W. Tax, Derek K. Jones, Mara Cercignani, Marco Palombo, Paddy J. Slator, Eleftheria Panagiotaki
Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) enables non-invasive assessment of prostate microstructure but conventional dMRI metrics such as the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient in multiparametric MRI and reflect a mixture of underlying tissues features rather than distinct histologic characteristics. Integrating dMRI with the compartment-based biophysical VERDICT (Vascular, Extracellular, and Restricted Diffusion for Cytometry in Tumours) framework offers richer microstructural insights, though clinical gradient systems (40-80 mT/m) often suffer from poor signal-to-noise ratio at stronger diffusion weightings due to prolonged echo times. Ultra-strong gradients (e.g., 300 mT/m) can mitigate these limitations by improving SNR and contrast-to-noise ratios. This study investigates whether physics-informed self-supervised VERDICT (ssVERDICT) fitting when combined with ultra-strong gradient data, enhances prostate microstructural characterization relative to current fitting approaches and clinical gradient systems. We developed enhanced ssVERDICT fitting approaches using dense multilayer perceptron and convolutional U-Net architectures, comparing them against non-linear least-squares (NLLS) VERDICT fitting, original ssVERDICT implementation, and Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging across clinical- to ultra-strong gradient systems. For the same ultra-strong gradient data, Dense ssVERDICT outperformed NLLS VERDICT, boosting median CNR by 47%, cutting inter-patient Coefficient of Variation by 52%, and reducing pooled $f_{ic}$ variation by 50%. Overall, Dense ssVERDICT delivered the highest CNR, the most stable parameter estimates, and the clearest tumour-normal contrast compared with conventional fitting methods and clinical gradient systems. These findings underscore that meaningful gains in non-invasive prostate cancer characterization arise from the combination of advanced gradient systems and deep learning-based modelling.

Title: Economic and Reliability Value of Improved Offshore Wind Forecasting in Bulk Power Grid Operation: A Case Study of The New York Power Grid
Authors: Khaled Bin Walid, Feng Ye, Jiaxiang Ji, Ahmed Aziz Ezzat, Travis Miles, Yazhou Leo Jiang
Abstract: This study investigates the economic and reliability benefits of improved offshore wind forecasting for grid operations along the U.S. East Coast. We introduce and evaluate a state-of-the-art, machine-learning-based offshore wind forecasting model tailored for this region by integrating its improved forecasts into a dynamic reserve procurement framework aligned with New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) practices to evaluate their economic value. To determine system-wide reserve needs, plant-specific reserves are aggregated. However, conventional methods overlook spatial correlation across sites, often leading to over procurement. To address this, we propose a risk-based reserve aggregation technique that leverages spatial diversification. Additionally, we evaluate the reliability improvements enabled by the enhanced offshore wind forecast. To evaluate the operational impact, we propose an operational resource adequacy framework that captures uncertainty from forecast errors and grid conditions. Using this framework, we quantify key reliability metrics under different offshore wind forecast scenarios. Using New York State as a case study, we find that the improved forecast enables more accurate reserve estimation, reducing procurement costs by 5.53% in 2035 scenario compared to a well-validated numerical weather prediction model. Applying the risk-based aggregation further reduces total production costs by 7.21%. From a reliability perspective, the improved forecasts lower the system Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) by approximately 19% in the 2035 scenario, highlighting its potential to enhance system reliability during real-time grid operations.

Title: Reliable Grid Forecasting: State Space Models for Safety-Critical Energy Systems
Authors: Sunki Hong, Jisoo Lee
Abstract: Accurate grid load forecasting is safety-critical: under-predictions risk supply shortfalls, while symmetric error metrics can mask this operational asymmetry. We introduce an operator-legible evaluation framework -- Under-Prediction Rate (UPR), tail Reserve$_{99.5}^{\%}$ requirements, and explicit inflation diagnostics (Bias$_{24h}$/OPR) -- to quantify one-sided reliability risk beyond MAPE. Using this framework, we evaluate state space models (Mamba variants) and strong baselines on a weather-aligned California Independent System Operator (CAISO) dataset spanning Nov 2023--Nov 2025 (84,498 hourly records across 5 regional transmission areas) under a rolling-origin walk-forward backtest. We develop and evaluate thermal-lag-aligned weather fusion strategies for these architectures. Our results demonstrate that standard accuracy metrics are insufficient proxies for operational safety: models with comparable MAPE can imply materially different tail reserve requirements (Reserve$_{99.5}^{\%}$). We show that explicit weather integration narrows error distributions, reducing the impact of temperature-driven demand spikes. Furthermore, while probabilistic calibration reduces large-error events, it can induce systematic schedule inflation. We introduce Bias/OPR-constrained objectives to enable auditable trade-offs between minimizing tail risk and preventing trivial over-forecasting.

Title: Towards Fine-Grained and Multi-Granular Contrastive Language-Speech Pre-training
Authors: Yifan Yang, Bing Han, Hui Wang, Wei Wang, Ziyang Ma, Long Zhou, Zengrui Jin, Guanrou Yang, Tianrui Wang, Xu Tan, Xie Chen
Abstract: Modeling fine-grained speaking styles remains challenging for language-speech representation pre-training, as existing speech-text models are typically trained with coarse captions or task-specific supervision, and scalable fine-grained style annotations are unavailable. We present FCaps, a large-scale dataset with fine-grained free-text style descriptions, encompassing 47k hours of speech and 19M fine-grained captions annotated via a novel end-to-end pipeline that directly grounds detailed captions in audio, thereby avoiding the error propagation caused by LLM-based rewriting in existing cascaded pipelines. Evaluations using LLM-as-a-judge demonstrate that our annotations surpass existing cascaded annotations in terms of correctness, coverage, and naturalness. Building on FCaps, we propose CLSP, a contrastive language-speech pre-trained model that integrates global and fine-grained supervision, enabling unified representations across multiple granularities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLSP learns fine-grained and multi-granular speech-text representations that perform reliably across global and fine-grained speech-text retrieval, zero-shot paralinguistic classification, and speech style similarity scoring, with strong alignment to human judgments. Code and dataset are publicly available at this https URL.

Title: A Constraint Programming Model for the Super-Agile Earth Observation Satellite Imaging Scheduling Problem
Authors: Margarida Caleiras, Samuel Moniz, Paulo Jorge Nascimento
Abstract: As the dependence on satellite imaging continues to grow, modern satellites have become increasingly agile, with the new generation, namely super-agile Earth observation satellites (SAEOS), providing unprecedented imaging flexibility. The highly dynamic capabilities of these satellites introduce additional challenges to the scheduling of observation tasks, as existing approaches for conventional agile satellites do not account for variable observation durations and multiple imaging directions. Although some efforts have been made in this regard, the SAEOS imaging scheduling problem (SAEOS-ISP) remains largely unexplored, and no exact approaches have yet been proposed. In this context, this study presents the first exact Constraint Programming formulation for the SAEOS-ISP, considering flexible observation windows, multiple pointing directions and sequence-dependent transition times across multiple satellites. Computational experiments on a newly generated benchmark set demonstrate that the model can be solved efficiently and within very short computational times. Moreover, the results also show that the proposed approach has the potential to achieve higher computational performance compared to the non-exact approaches that are currently considered state-of-the-art.

Title: Adaptive Rotary Steering with Joint Autoregression for Robust Extraction of Closely Moving Speakers in Dynamic Scenarios
Authors: Jakob Kienegger, Timo Gerkmann
Abstract: Latest advances in deep spatial filtering for Ambisonics demonstrate strong performance in stationary multi-speaker scenarios by rotating the sound field toward a target speaker prior to multi-channel enhancement. For applicability in dynamic acoustic conditions with moving speakers, we propose to automate this rotary steering using an interleaved tracking algorithm conditioned on the target's initial direction. However, for nearby or crossing speakers, robust tracking becomes difficult and spatial cues less effective for enhancement. By incorporating the processed recording as additional guide into both algorithms, our novel joint autoregressive framework leverages temporal-spectral correlations of speech to resolve spatially challenging speaker constellations. Consequently, our proposed method significantly improves tracking and enhancement of closely spaced speakers, consistently outperforming comparable non-autoregressive methods on a synthetic dataset. Real-world recordings complement these findings in complex scenarios with multiple speaker crossings and varying speaker-to-array distances.

Title: Network Slicing Resource Management in Uplink User-Centric Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems
Authors: Manobendu Sarker, Soumaya Cherkaoui
Abstract: This paper addresses the joint optimization of per-user equipment (UE) bandwidth allocation and UE-access point (AP) association to maximize weighted sum-rate while satisfying heterogeneous quality-of-service (QoS) requirements across enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) slices in the uplink of a network slicing-enabled user-centric cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system. The formulated problem is NP-hard, rendering global optimality computationally intractable. To address this challenge, it is decomposed into two sub-problems, each solved by a computationally efficient heuristic scheme, and jointly optimized through an alternating optimization framework. We then propose (i) a bandwidth allocation scheme that balances UE priority, spectral efficiency, and minimum bandwidth demand under limited resources to ensure fair QoS distribution, and (ii) a priority-based UE-AP association assignment approach that balances UE service quality with system capacity constraints. Together, these approaches provide a practical and computationally efficient solution for resource-constrained network slicing scenarios, where QoS feasibility is often violated under dense deployments and limited bandwidth, necessitating graceful degradation and fair QoS preservation rather than solely maximizing the aggregate sum-rate. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves up to 52% higher weighted sum-rate, 140% and 58% higher QoS success rates for eMBB and URLLC slices, respectively, while reducing runtime by up to 97% compared to the considered benchmarks.

Title: Priority-Based Bandwidth Allocation in Network Slicing-Enabled Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems
Authors: Manobendu Sarker, Soumaya Cherkaoui
Abstract: This paper addresses joint admission control and per-user equipment (UE) bandwidth allocation to maximize weighted sum-rate in network slicing-enabled user-centric cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems when aggregate quality-of-service (QoS) demand may exceed available bandwidth. Specifically, we optimize bandwidth allocation while satisfying heterogeneous QoS requirements across enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) slices in the uplink. The formulated problem is NP-hard, rendering global optimality computationally intractable. We decompose it into two sub-problems and solve them via computationally efficient heuristics within a sequential framework. We propose (i) a hierarchical admission control scheme that selectively admits UEs under bandwidth scarcity, prioritizing URLLC to ensure latency-sensitive QoS compliance, and (ii) an iterative gradient-based bandwidth allocation scheme that transfers bandwidth across slices guided by marginal utility and reallocates resources within slices. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves near-optimal performance, deviating from an interior point solver-based benchmark by at most 2.2% in weighted sum-rate while reducing runtime by 99.7%, thereby enabling practical real-time deployment. Compared to a baseline round-robin scheme without admission control, the proposed approach achieves up to 1085% and 7% higher success rates for eMBB and URLLC slices, respectively, by intentionally sacrificing sum-rate to guarantee QoS. Sensitivity analysis further reveals that the proposed solution adapts effectively to diverse eMBB/URLLC traffic compositions, maintaining 47-51% eMBB and 93-94% URLLC success rates across varying load scenarios, confirming its robustness for resource-constrained large-scale deployments.

Title: Closed-loop Uplink Radio Resource Management in CF-O-RAN Empowered 5G Aerial Corridor
Authors: Manobendu Sarker, Md. Zoheb Hassan, Xianbin Wang
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the uplink (UL) radio resource management for 5G aerial corridors with an open-radio access network (O-RAN)-enabled cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system. Our objective is to maximize the minimum spectral efficiency (SE) by jointly optimizing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-open radio unit (O-RU) association and UL transmit power under quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. Owing to its NP-hard nature, the formulated problem is decomposed into two tractable sub-problems solved via alternating optimization (AO) using two computationally efficient algorithms. We then propose (i) a QoS-driven and multi-connectivity-enabled association algorithm incorporating UAV-centric and O-RU-centric criteria with targeted refinement for weak UAVs, and (ii) a bisection-guided fixed-point power control algorithm achieving global optimality with significantly reduced complexity, hosted as xApp at the near-real-time (near-RT) RAN intelligent controller (RIC) of O-RAN. Solving the resource-allocation problem requires global channel state information (CSI), which incurs substantial measurement and signaling overhead. To mitigate this, we leverage a channel knowledge map (CKM) within the O-RAN non-RT RIC to enable efficient environment-aware CSI inference. Simulation results show that the proposed framework achieves up to 440% improvement in minimum SE, 100% QoS satisfaction and fairness, while reducing runtime by up to 99.7% compared to an interior point solver-based power allocation solution, thereby enabling O-RAN compliant real-time deployment.

Title: Research on Adaptive Inertial Control in Synchronization Systems: Based on Variational Optimization Methods and Their Applications in the Stability of Complex Networks
Authors: Yiwei Zhou, Zhongcheng Lei, Xiaoran Dai, Wenshan Hu, Hong Zhou
Abstract: Aiming at the core problem that it is difficult for a fixed inertia coefficient to balance transient disturbance suppression and long-term stability in complex network synchronization systems, an adaptive inertia control strategy based on variational optimization is proposed. Taking the Kuramoto model with inertia as the research carrier, the analytical expression of the time-varying inertia coefficient M(t) is strictly derived by the functional variational method, and a hierarchical control structure of "benchmark inertia + disturbance feedback" is constructed to achieve the organic unity of minimizing the vulnerability performance function H(T) and stability constraints. A multimodal decoupling control strategy based on Laplacian eigenvector projection is designed to enhance the feedback strength of the dominant mode by eigenvalue weighting, improving the control accuracy and dynamic response speed. Simulation verification is carried out in complex network systems, and the control performance of regular networks (RG), random networks (ER), small-world networks (SW), scale-free networks (SF) and spider webs (SP) under three typical disturbances of pulses, monotonic decays and oscillatory decays is systematically analyzed. The results show that the proposed strategy reduces H(T) of the five networks by 19%-25%, shortens the relaxation time by 15%-24%, and the real parts of all system eigenvalues are less than -0.25s^-1 , meeting the asymptotic stability criterion. This study provides a new theoretical framework and engineering implementation scheme for the stability control of complex network synchronization systems, which can be widely applied to fields such as power grids, communication networks, and neural networks.

Title: Reinforced Inverse Scattering
Authors: Hanyang Jiang, Yuehaw Khoo, Haizhao Yang
Abstract: Inverse wave scattering aims at determining the properties of an object using data on how the object scatters incoming waves. In order to collect information, sensors are put in different locations to send and receive waves from each other. The choice of sensor positions and incident wave frequencies determines the reconstruction quality of scatterer properties. This paper introduces reinforcement learning to develop precision imaging that decides sensor positions and wave frequencies adaptive to different scatterers in an intelligent way, thus obtaining a significant improvement in reconstruction quality with limited imaging resources. Extensive numerical results will be provided to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing methods.

Title: Co-Buchi Barrier Certificates for Discrete-time Dynamical Systems
Authors: Vishnu Murali, Ashutosh Trivedi, Majid Zamani
Abstract: Barrier certificates provide functional overapproximations for the reachable set of dynamical systems and provide inductive guarantees on the safe evolution of the system. In automata-theoretic verification, a key query is to determine whether the system visits a given predicate over the states finitely often, typically resulting from the complement of the traditional Buchi acceptance condition. This paper proposes a barrier certificate approach to answer such queries by developing a notion of co-Buchi barrier certificates (CBBCs) that generalize classic barrier certificates to ensure that the traces of a system visit a given predicate a fixed number of times. Our notion of CBBC is inspired from bounded synthesis paradigm to LTL realizability, where the LTL specifications are converted to safety automata via universal co-Buchi automata with a bound on final state visitations provided as a hyperparameter. Our application of CBBCs in verification is analogous: we fix a bound and search for a suitable barrier certificate, increasing the bound if no suitable function can be found. We then use these CBBCs to verify our system against properties specified by co-Buchi automata and demonstrate their effectiveness via some case studies.

Title: E-BATS: Efficient Backpropagation-Free Test-Time Adaptation for Speech Foundation Models
Authors: Jiaheng Dong, Hong Jia, Soumyajit Chatterjee, Abhirup Ghosh, James Bailey, Ting Dang
Abstract: Speech Foundation Models encounter significant performance degradation when deployed in real-world scenarios involving acoustic domain shifts, such as background noise and speaker accents. Test-time adaptation (TTA) has recently emerged as a viable strategy to address such domain shifts at inference time without requiring access to source data or labels. However, existing TTA approaches, particularly those relying on backpropagation, are memory-intensive, limiting their applicability in speech tasks and resource-constrained settings. Although backpropagation-free methods offer improved efficiency, existing ones exhibit poor accuracy. This is because they are predominantly developed for vision tasks, which fundamentally differ from speech task formulations, noise characteristics, and model architecture, posing unique transferability challenges. In this paper, we introduce E-BATS, the first Efficient BAckpropagation-free TTA framework designed explicitly for speech foundation models. E-BATS achieves a balance between adaptation effectiveness and memory efficiency through three key components: (i) lightweight prompt adaptation for a forward-pass-based feature alignment, (ii) a multi-scale loss to capture both global (utterance-level) and local distribution shifts (token-level) and (iii) a test-time exponential moving average mechanism for stable adaptation across utterances. Experiments conducted on four noisy speech datasets spanning sixteen acoustic conditions demonstrate consistent improvements, with 4.1%-13.5% accuracy gains over backpropagation-free baselines and 2.0-6.4 times GPU memory savings compared to backpropagation-based methods. By enabling scalable and robust adaptation under acoustic variability, this work paves the way for developing more efficient adaptation approaches for practical speech processing systems in real-world environments.

Title: A Comparative Evaluation of Deep Learning Models for Speech Enhancement in Real-World Noisy Environments
Authors: Md Jahangir Alam Khondkar, Ajan Ahmed, Stephanie Schuckers, Masudul Haider Imtiaz
Abstract: Speech enhancement, particularly denoising, is vital in improving the intelligibility and quality of speech signals for real-world applications, especially in noisy environments. While prior research has introduced various deep learning models for this purpose, many struggle to balance noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker-specific feature preservation, leaving a critical research gap in their comparative performance evaluation. This study benchmarks three state-of-the-art models Wave-U-Net, CMGAN, and U-Net, on diverse datasets such as SpEAR, VPQAD, and Clarkson datasets. These models were chosen due to their relevance in the literature and code accessibility. The evaluation reveals that U-Net achieves high noise suppression with SNR improvements of +71.96% on SpEAR, +64.83% on VPQAD, and +364.2% on the Clarkson dataset. CMGAN outperforms in perceptual quality, attaining the highest PESQ scores of 4.04 on SpEAR and 1.46 on VPQAD, making it well-suited for applications prioritizing natural and intelligible speech. Wave-U-Net balances these attributes with improvements in speaker-specific feature retention, evidenced by VeriSpeak score gains of +10.84% on SpEAR and +27.38% on VPQAD. This research indicates how advanced methods can optimize trade-offs between noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker recognition. The findings may contribute to advancing voice biometrics, forensic audio analysis, telecommunication, and speaker verification in challenging acoustic conditions.

Title: MambAttention: Mamba with Multi-Head Attention for Generalizable Single-Channel Speech Enhancement
Authors: Nikolai Lund Kühne, Jesper Jensen, Jan Østergaard, Zheng-Hua Tan
Abstract: With new sequence models like Mamba and xLSTM, several studies have shown that these models match or outperform the state-of-the-art in single-channel speech enhancement and audio representation learning. However, prior research has demonstrated that sequence models like LSTM and Mamba tend to overfit to the training set. To address this, previous works have shown that adding self-attention to LSTMs substantially improves generalization performance for single-channel speech enhancement. Nevertheless, neither the concept of hybrid Mamba and time-frequency attention models nor their generalization performance have been explored for speech enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid architecture, MambAttention, which combines Mamba and shared time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalizable single-channel speech enhancement. To train our model, we introduce VB-DemandEx, a dataset inspired by VoiceBank+Demand but with more challenging noise types and lower signal-to-noise ratios. Trained on VB-DemandEx, MambAttention significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art discriminative LSTM-, xLSTM-, Mamba-, and Conformer-based systems of similar complexity across all reported metrics on two out-of-domain datasets: DNS 2020 without reverberation and EARS-WHAM_v2. MambAttention also matches or outperforms generative diffusion models in generalization performance while being competitive with language model baselines. Ablation studies highlight the importance of weight sharing between time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalization performance. Finally, we explore integrating the shared time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules with LSTM and xLSTM, which yields a notable performance improvement on the out-of-domain datasets. Yet, MambAttention remains superior for cross-corpus generalization across all reported evaluation metrics.

Title: Mitigating Data Imbalance in Automated Speaking Assessment
Authors: Fong-Chun Tsai, Kuan-Tang Huang, Bi-Cheng Yan, Tien-Hong Lo, Berlin Chen
Abstract: Automated Speaking Assessment (ASA) plays a crucial role in evaluating second-language (L2) learners proficiency. However, ASA models often suffer from class imbalance, leading to biased predictions. To address this, we introduce a novel objective for training ASA models, dubbed the Balancing Logit Variation (BLV) loss, which perturbs model predictions to improve feature representation for minority classes without modifying the dataset. Evaluations on the ICNALE benchmark dataset show that integrating the BLV loss into a celebrated text-based (BERT) model significantly enhances classification accuracy and fairness, making automated speech evaluation more robust for diverse learners.

Title: Exploring Fine-Tuning of Large Audio Language Models for Spoken Language Understanding under Limited Speech Data
Authors: Youngwon Choi, Jaeyoon Jung, Hyeonyu Kim, Huu-Kim Nguyen, Hwayeon Kim
Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have emerged as powerful tools for speech-related tasks but remain underexplored for fine-tuning, especially with limited speech data. To bridge this gap, we systematically examine how different fine-tuning schemes including text-only, direct mixing, and curriculum learning affect spoken language understanding (SLU), focusing on scenarios where text-label pairs are abundant while paired speech-label data are limited. Results show that LALMs already achieve competitive performance with text-only fine-tuning, highlighting their strong generalization ability. Adding even small amounts of speech data (2-5%) yields substantial further gains, with curriculum learning particularly effective under scarce data. In cross-lingual SLU, combining source-language speech data with target-language text and minimal target-language speech data enables effective adaptation. Overall, this study provides practical insights into the LALM fine-tuning under realistic data constraints.

Title: Targeted Fine-Tuning of DNN-Based Receivers via Influence Functions
Authors: Marko Tuononen, Heikki Penttinen, Ville Hautamäki
Abstract: We present the first use of influence functions for deep learning-based wireless receivers. Applied to DeepRx, a fully convolutional receiver, influence analysis reveals which training samples drive bit predictions, enabling targeted fine-tuning of poorly performing cases. We show that loss-relative influence with capacity-like binary cross-entropy loss and first-order updates on beneficial samples most consistently improves bit error rate toward genie-aided performance, outperforming random fine-tuning in single-target scenarios. Multi-target adaptation proved less effective, underscoring open challenges. Beyond experiments, we connect influence to self-influence corrections and propose a second-order, influence-aligned update strategy. Our results establish influence functions as both an interpretability tool and a basis for efficient receiver adaptation.

Title: PPGFlowECG: Latent Rectified Flow with Cross-Modal Encoding for PPG-Guided ECG Generation and Cardiovascular Disease Detection
Authors: Xiaocheng Fang, Jiarui Jin, Haoyu Wang, Che Liu, Jieyi Cai, Yujie Xiao, Guangkun Nie, Bo Liu, Shun Huang, Hongyan Li, Shenda Hong
Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) is the clinical gold standard for cardiovascular disease (CVD) assessment, yet continuous monitoring is constrained by the need for dedicated hardware and trained personnel. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is ubiquitous in wearable devices and readily scalable, but it lacks electrophysiological specificity, limiting diagnostic reliability. While generative methods aim to translate PPG into clinically useful ECG signals, existing approaches are limited by the misalignment of physiological semantics in generative models and the complexity of modeling in high-dimensional signals. To address these limitations, we propose PPGFlowECG, a two-stage framework that aligns PPG and ECG in a shared latent space using the CardioAlign Encoder and then synthesizes ECGs with latent rectified flow. We further provide a formal analysis of this coupling, showing that the CardioAlign Encoder is necessary to guarantee stable and semantically consistent ECG synthesis under our formulation. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate improved synthesis fidelity and downstream diagnostic utility. These results indicate that PPGFlowECG supports scalable, wearable-first CVD screening when standard ECG acquisition is unavailable.

Title: Exploring Resolution-Wise Shared Attention in Hybrid Mamba-U-Nets for Improved Cross-Corpus Speech Enhancement
Authors: Nikolai Lund Kühne, Jesper Jensen, Jan Østergaard, Zheng-Hua Tan
Abstract: Recent advances in speech enhancement have shown that models combining Mamba and attention mechanisms yield superior cross-corpus generalization performance. At the same time, integrating Mamba in a U-Net structure has yielded state-of-the-art enhancement performance, while reducing both model size and computational complexity. Inspired by these insights, we propose RWSA-MambaUNet, a novel and efficient hybrid model combining Mamba and multi-head attention in a U-Net structure for improved cross-corpus performance. Resolution-wise shared attention (RWSA) refers to layerwise attention-sharing across corresponding time- and frequency resolutions. Our best-performing RWSA-MambaUNet model achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on two out-of-domain test sets. Notably, our smallest model surpasses all baselines on the out-of-domain DNS 2020 test set in terms of PESQ, SSNR, and ESTOI, and on the out-of-domain EARS-WHAM_v2 test set in terms of SSNR, ESTOI, and SI-SDR, while using less than half the model parameters and a fraction of the FLOPs.

Title: Hierarchical Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Depression Detection from Speech
Authors: Yuxin Li, Eng Siong Chng, Cuntai Guan
Abstract: Speech-based depression detection (SDD) has emerged as a non-invasive and scalable alternative to conventional clinical assessments. However, existing methods still struggle to capture robust depression-related speech characteristics, which are sparse and heterogeneous. Although pretrained self-supervised learning (SSL) models provide rich representations, most recent SDD studies extract features from a single layer of the pretrained SSL model for the downstream classifier. This practice overlooks the complementary roles of low-level acoustic features and high-level semantic information inherently encoded in different SSL model layers. To explicitly model interactions between acoustic and semantic representations within an utterance, we propose a hierarchical adaptive representation encoder with prior knowledge that disengages and re-aligns acoustic and semantic information through asymmetric cross-attention, enabling fine-grained acoustic patterns to be interpreted in semantic context. In addition, a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) objective is applied as auxiliary supervision to handle the irregular temporal distribution of depressive characteristics without requiring frame-level annotations. Experiments on DAIC-WOZ and MODMA demonstrate that HAREN-CTC consistently outperforms existing methods under both performance upper-bound evaluation and generalization evaluation settings, achieving Macro F1 scores of 0.81 and 0.82 respectively in upper-bound evaluation, and maintaining superior performance with statistically significant improvements in precision and AUC under rigorous cross-validation. These findings suggest that modeling hierarchical acoustic-semantic interactions better reflects how depressive characteristics manifest in natural speech, enabling scalable and objective depression assessment.

Title: Extending Audio Context for Long-Form Understanding in Large Audio-Language Models
Authors: Yuatyong Chaichana, Pittawat Taveekitworachai, Warit Sirichotedumrong, Potsawee Manakul, Kunat Pipatanakul
Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are often constrained by short audio context windows, even when their text backbones support long contexts, limiting long-form audio understanding. Prior work has introduced context-extension methods (e.g. YaRN) on unimodal LLMs, yet their application to LALMs remains unexplored. First, building on RoPE-based context extension, we introduce Partial YaRN, a training-free, modality-decoupled extension method that modifies only audio token positions, leaving text positions intact to preserve the base LLM's text capabilities. Second, we propose Virtual Longform Audio Training (VLAT), a training strategy that extends Partial YaRN into a training-time positional augmentation. VLAT simulates diverse audio lengths during training, enabling generalization to inputs far longer than those seen in training. Our experiments on SALMONN and Qwen2-Audio confirm that Partial YaRN outperforms the original models across wide range of settings, and VLAT provides substantial performance improvement on long audio of unseen lengths.

Title: Graph Neural Network Reveals the Local Cortical Morphology of Brain Aging in Normal Cognition and Alzheimers Disease
Authors: Samuel D. Anderson, Nikhil N. Chaudhari, Nahian F. Chowdhury, Jordan Jomsky, Andrei Irimia, Xiaoyu (Rayne)Zheng, Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
Abstract: Estimating brain age (BA) from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs) provides a useful approach to map the anatomic features of brain senescence. Whereas global BA (GBA) summarizes overall brain health, local BA (LBA) can reveal spatially localized patterns of aging. Although previous studies have examined anatomical contributors to GBA, no framework has been established to compute LBA using cortical morphology. To address this gap, we introduce a novel graph neural network (GNN) that uses morphometric features (cortical thickness, curvature, surface area, gray/white matter intensity ratio and sulcal depth) to estimate LBA across the cortical surface at high spatial resolution (mean inter-vertex distance = 1.37 mm). Trained on cortical surface meshes extracted from the MRIs of cognitively normal adults (N = 14,250), our GNN identifies prefrontal and parietal association cortices as early sites of morphometric aging, in concordance with biological theories of brain aging. Feature comparison using integrated gradients reveals that morphological aging is driven primarily by changes in surface area (gyral crowns and highly folded regions) and cortical thickness (occipital lobes), with additional contributions from gray/white matter intensity ratio (frontal lobes and sulcal troughs) and curvature (sulcal troughs). In Alzheimers disease (AD), as expected, the model identifies widespread, excessive morphological aging in parahippocampal gyri and related temporal structures. Significant associations are found between regional LBA gaps and neuropsychological measures descriptive of AD-related cognitive impairment, suggesting an intimate relationship between morphological cortical aging and cognitive decline. These results highlight the ability of GNN-derived gero-morphometry to provide insights into local brain aging.

Title: Karhunen-Loève Expansion-Based Residual Anomaly Map for Resource-Efficient Glioma MRI Segmentation
Authors: Anthony Hur
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors is essential for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Deep learning is currently the state-of-the-art for brain tumor segmentation, yet it requires either large datasets or extensive computational resources that are inaccessible in most areas. This makes the problem increasingly difficult: state-of-the-art models use thousands of training cases and vast computational power, where performance drops sharply when either is limited. The top performer in the Brats GLI 2023 competition relied on supercomputers trained on over 92,000 augmented MRI scans using an AMD EPYC 7402 CPU, six NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPUs (48GB VRAM each), and 1024GB of RAM over multiple weeks. To address this, the Karhunen--Loève Expansion (KLE) was implemented as a feature extraction step on downsampled, z-score normalized MRI volumes. Each 240$\times$240$\times$155 multi-modal scan is reduced to four $48^3$ channels and compressed into 32 KL coefficients. The resulting approximate reconstruction enables a residual-based anomaly map, which is upsampled and added as a fifth channel to a compact 3D U-Net. All experiments were run on a consumer workstation (AMD Ryzen 5 7600X CPU, RTX 4060Ti (8GB VRAM), and 64GB RAM while using far fewer training cases. This model achieves post-processed Dice scores of 0.929 (WT), 0.856 (TC), and 0.821 (ET), with HD95 distances of 2.93, 6.78, and 10.35 voxels. These results are significantly better than the winning BraTS 2023 methodology for HD95 distances and WT dice scores. This demonstrates that a KLE-based residual anomaly map can dramatically reduce computational cost and data requirements while retaining state-of-the-art performance.

Title: Robust Verification of Concurrent Stochastic Games
Authors: Angel Y. He, David Parker
Abstract: Autonomous systems often operate in multi-agent settings and need to make concurrent, strategic decisions, typically in uncertain environments. Verification and control problems for these systems can be tackled with concurrent stochastic games (CSGs), but this model requires transition probabilities to be precisely specified - an unrealistic requirement in many real-world settings. We introduce *robust CSGs* and their subclass *interval CSGs* (ICSGs), which capture epistemic uncertainty about transition probabilities in CSGs. We propose a novel framework for *robust* verification of these models under worst-case assumptions about transition uncertainty. Specifically, we develop the underlying theoretical foundations and efficient algorithms, for finite- and infinite-horizon objectives in both zero-sum and nonzero-sum settings, the latter based on (social-welfare optimal) Nash equilibria. We build an implementation in the PRISM-games model checker and demonstrate the feasibility of robust verification of ICSGs across a selection of large benchmarks.

Title: Sound2Hap: Learning Audio-to-Vibrotactile Haptic Generation from Human Ratings
Authors: Yinan Li, Hasti Seifi
Abstract: Environmental sounds like footsteps, keyboard typing, or dog barking carry rich information and emotional context, making them valuable for designing haptics in user applications. Existing audio-to-vibration methods, however, rely on signal-processing rules tuned for music or games and often fail to generalize across diverse sounds. To address this, we first investigated user perception of four existing audio-to-haptic algorithms, then created a data-driven model for environmental sounds. In Study 1, 34 participants rated vibrations generated by the four algorithms for 1,000 sounds, revealing no consistent algorithm preferences. Using this dataset, we trained Sound2Hap, a CNN-based autoencoder, to generate perceptually meaningful vibrations from diverse sounds with low latency. In Study 2, 15 participants rated its output higher than signal-processing baselines on both audio-vibration match and Haptic Experience Index (HXI), finding it more harmonious with diverse sounds. This work demonstrates a perceptually validated approach to audio-haptic translation, broadening the reach of sound-driven haptics.

Title: Performance and Complexity Trade-off Optimization of Speech Models During Training
Authors: Esteban Gómez, Tom Bäckström
Abstract: In speech machine learning, neural network models are typically designed by choosing an architecture with fixed layer sizes and structure. These models are then trained to maximize performance on metrics aligned with the task's objective. While the overall architecture is usually guided by prior knowledge of the task, the sizes of individual layers are often chosen heuristically. However, this approach does not guarantee an optimal trade-off between performance and computational complexity; consequently, post hoc methods such as weight quantization or model pruning are typically employed to reduce computational cost. This occurs because stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods can only optimize differentiable functions, while factors influencing computational complexity, such as layer sizes and floating-point operations per second (FLOP/s), are non-differentiable and require modifying the model structure during training. We propose a reparameterization technique based on feature noise injection that enables joint optimization of performance and computational complexity during training using SGD-based methods. Unlike traditional pruning methods, our approach allows the model size to be dynamically optimized for a target performance-complexity trade-off, without relying on heuristic criteria to select which weights or structures to remove. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through three case studies, including a synthetic example and two practical real-world applications: voice activity detection and audio anti-spoofing. The code related to our work is publicly available to encourage further research.
