Title: A novel real-time aeroelastic hybrid simulation system of section model wind tunnel testing based on adaptive extended Kalman filter
Authors: Wenkai Du, Guangzhong Gao, Suhan Li, Bo Fu, Jiawu Li, Ledong Zhu
Abstract: Elastically-supported section model tests are the most basic experimental technique in wind engineering, where helical springs are commonly employed to simulate the two-degree-of-freedom low-order modal motions of flexible structures. However, the traditional technique has intrinsic limitations in accurately modeling nonlinear structural behaviors and accurate adjustments of nonlinear structural damping. This study proposes a novel Real-Time Aeroelastic Hybrid Simulation system for section model wind tunnel tests by integrating an active control algorithm of adaptive Kalman filter. The proposed system enables the simulation of nonlinear heave-transverse-torsion coupled vibrations of a section model under the action of the oncoming wind. The structural properties, i.g. mass, damping and stiffness, are numerically simulated via an active control system, and the aerodynamic forces are physically modelled via the model-wind interaction in the wind tunnel. To validate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed RTAHS system, a MATLAB/Simulink-FLUENT/UDF co-simulation framework is developed. Numerical verification results indicate that the proposed algorithm effectively estimates the motion responses in both linear and nonlinear scenarios.

Title: A Novel Parameter-Tying Theorem in Multi-Model Adaptive Systems: Systematic Approach for Efficient Model Selection
Authors: Farid Mafi (1), Ladan Khoshnevisan (1), Mohammad Pirani (2), Amir Khajepour (1) ((1) Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada (2) Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada)
Abstract: This paper presents a novel theoretical framework for reducing the computational complexity of multi-model adaptive control/estimation systems through systematic transformation to controllable canonical form. While traditional multi-model approaches face exponential growth in computational demands with increasing system dimension, we introduce a parameter-tying theorem that enables significant dimension reduction through careful analysis of system characteristics in canonical form. The approach leverages monotonicity properties and coordinated parameter relationships to establish minimal sets of identification models while preserving system stability and performance. We develop rigorous criteria for verifying plant inclusion within the convex hull of identification models and derive weight transformation relationships that maintain system properties across coordinate transformations. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through application to coupled lateral-roll vehicle dynamics, where the dimension reduction enables real-time implementation while maintaining estimation accuracy. The results show that the proposed transformation approach can achieve comparable performance to conventional methods while requiring substantially fewer identification models, enabling practical deployment in high-dimensional systems.

Title: Fault Detection and Human Intervention in Vehicle Platooning: A Multi-Model Framework
Authors: Farid Mafi (1), Mohammad Pirani (2) ((1) Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada (2) Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada)
Abstract: Vehicle platooning has been a promising solution for improving traffic efficiency and throughput. However, a failure in a single vehicle, including communication loss with neighboring vehicles, can significantly disrupt platoon performance and potentially trigger cascading effects. Similar to modern autonomous vehicles, platoon systems require human drivers to take control during failures, leading to scenarios where vehicles are operated by drivers with diverse driving styles. This paper presents a novel multi-model approach for simultaneously identifying signal drop locations and driver attitudes in vehicular platoons using only tail vehicle measurements. The proposed method distinguishes between attentive and distracted driver behaviors by analyzing the propagation patterns of disturbances through the platoon system. Beyond its application in platooning, our methodology for detecting driver behavior using a multi-model approach provides a novel framework for human driver identification. To enhance computational efficiency for real-time applications, we introduce a blending-based identification method utilizing chosen models and weighted interpolation, significantly reducing the number of required models while maintaining detection accuracy. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through high-fidelity CarSim/Simulink environment simulations. Results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately identify both the location of signal drops and the corresponding driver behavior. This approach minimizes the complexity and cost of fault detection while ensuring accuracy and reliability.

Title: A state reduction approach for learning-based model predictive control for train rescheduling
Authors: Caio Fabio Oliveira da Silva, Xiaoyu Liu, Azita Dabiri, Bart De Schutter
Abstract: This paper proposes a state reduction method for learning-based model predictive control (MPC) for train rescheduling in urban rail transit systems. The state reduction integrates into a control framework where the discrete decision variables are determined by a learning-based classifier and the continuous decision variables are computed by MPC. Herein, the state representation is designed separately for each component of the control framework. While a reduced state is employed for learning, a full state is used in MPC. Simulations on a large-scale train network highlight the effectiveness of the state reduction mechanism in improving the performance and reducing the memory usage.

Title: Towards Flow-Matching-based TTS without Classifier-Free Guidance
Authors: Yuzhe Liang, Wenzhe Liu, Chunyu Qiang, Zhikang Niu, Yushen Chen, Ziyang Ma, Wenxi Chen, Nan Li, Chen Zhang, Xie Chen
Abstract: Flow matching has demonstrated strong generative capabilities and has become a core component in modern Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems. To ensure high-quality speech synthesis, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is widely used during the inference of flow-matching-based TTS models. However, CFG incurs substantial computational cost as it requires two forward passes, which hinders its applicability in real-time scenarios. In this paper, we explore removing CFG from flow-matching-based TTS models to improve inference efficiency, while maintaining performance. Specifically, we reformulated the flow matching training target to directly approximate the CFG optimization trajectory. This training method eliminates the need for unconditional model evaluation and guided tuning during inference, effectively cutting the computational overhead in half. Furthermore, It can be seamlessly integrated with existing optimized sampling strategies. We validate our approach using the F5-TTS model on the LibriTTS dataset. Experimental results show that our method achieves a 9$\times$ inference speed-up compared to the baseline F5-TTS, while preserving comparable speech quality. We will release the code and models to support reproducibility and foster further research in this area.

Title: Theoretical Grid-Forming Extreme of Inverters
Authors: Qianxi Tang, Li Peng
Abstract: What are the theoretical and physical limits of a grid-forming inverter? This letter proposes that the extreme grid-forming ability of inverters is limited by their dc-side, ac-side, circuit topology dynamics, but not control. While many papers focus on how to improve grid-forming inverters stability, power sharing, inertia emulation, fault response, few, if any, formally define the fundamental theoretical limits or extremes of grid-forming behavior. It seems that the grid-forming can be improved endlessly. No physical system can support a grid indefinitely without limitations, especially under increasing levels of disturbance or uncertainty. Therefore, this boundary is explicitly shown by a mathematical expression in this letter. Consequently, the results show that relatively low dc-side voltage and high active power injection could damage the grid-forming ability. Poor consideration of dc-side, ac-side, and circuit topology dynamics in real practice will cause jeopardizing oscillation even by the theoretical best grid-forming control strategy.

Title: Estimation of Tissue Deformation and Interactive Force in Robotic Surgery through Vision-based Learning
Authors: Srikar Annamraju, Yuxi Chen, Jooyoung Lim, Inki Kim
Abstract: Goal: A limitation in robotic surgery is the lack of force feedback, due to challenges in suitable sensing techniques. To enhance the perception of the surgeons and precise force rendering, estimation of these forces along with tissue deformation level is presented here. Methods: An experimental test bed is built for studying the interaction, and the forces are estimated from the raw data. Since tissue deformation and stiffness are non-linearly related, they are independently computed for enhanced reliability. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based vision model is deployed, and both classification and regression models are developed. Results: The forces applied on the tissue are estimated, and the tissue is classified based on its deformation. The exact deformation of the tissue is also computed. Conclusions: The surgeons can render precise forces and detect tumors using the proposed method. The rarely discussed efficacy of computing the deformation level is also demonstrated.

Title: The Mean of Multi-Object Trajectories
Authors: Tran Thien Dat Nguyen, Ba Tuong Vo, Ba-Ngu Vo, Hoa Van Nguyen, Changbeom Shim
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of a mean for trajectories and multi-object trajectories--sets or multi-sets of trajectories--along with algorithms for computing them. Specifically, we use the Fréchet mean, and metrics based on the optimal sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) construct, to extend the notion of average from vectors to trajectories and multi-object trajectories. Further, we develop efficient algorithms to compute these means using greedy search and Gibbs sampling. Using distributed multi-object tracking as an application, we demonstrate that the Fréchet mean approach to multi-object trajectory consensus significantly outperforms state-of-the-art distributed multi-object tracking methods.

Title: SCOPE-MRI: Bankart Lesion Detection as a Case Study in Data Curation and Deep Learning for Challenging Diagnoses
Authors: Sahil Sethi, Sai Reddy, Mansi Sakarvadia, Jordan Serotte, Darlington Nwaudo, Nicholas Maassen, Lewis Shi
Abstract: While deep learning has shown strong performance in musculoskeletal imaging, existing work has largely focused on pathologies where diagnosis is not a clinical challenge, leaving more difficult problems underexplored, such as detecting Bankart lesions (anterior-inferior glenoid labral tears) on standard MRIs. Diagnosing these lesions is challenging due to their subtle imaging features, often leading to reliance on invasive MRI arthrograms (MRAs). This study introduces ScopeMRI, the first publicly available, expert-annotated dataset for shoulder pathologies, and presents a deep learning (DL) framework for detecting Bankart lesions on both standard MRIs and MRAs. ScopeMRI includes 586 shoulder MRIs (335 standard, 251 MRAs) from 558 patients who underwent arthroscopy. Ground truth labels were derived from intraoperative findings, the gold standard for diagnosis. Separate DL models for MRAs and standard MRIs were trained using a combination of CNNs and transformers. Predictions from sagittal, axial, and coronal views were ensembled to optimize performance. The models were evaluated on a 20% hold-out test set (117 MRIs: 46 MRAs, 71 standard MRIs). The models achieved an AUC of 0.91 and 0.93, sensitivity of 83% and 94%, and specificity of 91% and 86% for standard MRIs and MRAs, respectively. Notably, model performance on non-invasive standard MRIs matched or surpassed radiologists interpreting MRAs. External validation demonstrated initial generalizability across imaging protocols. This study demonstrates that DL models can achieve radiologist-level diagnostic performance on standard MRIs, reducing the need for invasive MRAs. By releasing ScopeMRI and a modular codebase for training and evaluating deep learning models on 3D medical imaging data, we aim to accelerate research in musculoskeletal imaging and support the development of new datasets for clinically challenging diagnostic tasks.

Title: A High-Resolution Transmission Line Model with De-embedding Structure for Ultralow Contact Resistivity Extraction
Authors: Xuanyu Jia (1), Hongxu Liao (1), Ming Li (1) ((1) School of Integrated Circuits, Peking University)
Abstract: In this article, we present a contact resistivity extraction method calibrated using a de-embedding structure, called High-Resolution Transmission Line Model (HR-TLM). HR-TLM has the similar infrastructure with Refined TLM (RTLM) or Refined-Ladder TLM(R-LTLM), but is optimized for calibration methods. Its advantage lies in maintaining low \r{ho}_c extraction accuracy while significantly reducing the impact of structural process errors. According to the error analysis model, we verify that the extraction accuracy of HR-TLM based on R-LTLM can reach 10-9 {\Omega}cm2 at micron scale lithography precision.

Title: Task-Oriented Semantic Communication with Importance-Aware Rate Control
Authors: Zhiye Sun, Shuai Ma, Shiyin Li
Abstract: Semantic communication is recognized for its high compression efficiency and robust resistance to noise. However, utilizing a fixed transmission rate in environments with dynamic signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) often results in inefficient use of communication resources. To address this challenge, this letter proposes an importance-aware rate control semantic communication (IRCSC) scheme, which dynamically adjusts transmission rates in response to both channel conditions and semantic importance. The scheme employs a contribution-based importance analyzer to rank semantic importance. Additionaly, a novel metric, the semantic transmission integrity index (STII), is proposed to quantify the amount of correctly transmitted information and to correlate it with inference performance. Simulations indicate that, with low computational complexity, IRCSC guarantees a controllable trade-off between performance and rate, delivering higher compression efficiency and improved task performance in high-SNR scenarios.

Title: LymphAtlas- A Unified Multimodal Lymphoma Imaging Repository Delivering AI-Enhanced Diagnostic Insight
Authors: Jiajun Ding, Beiyao Zhu, Xiaosheng Liu, Lishen Zhang, Zhao Liu
Abstract: This study integrates PET metabolic information with CT anatomical structures to establish a 3D multimodal segmentation dataset for lymphoma based on whole-body FDG PET/CT examinations, which bridges the gap of the lack of standardised multimodal segmentation datasets in the field of haematological malignancies. We retrospectively collected 483 examination datasets acquired between March 2011 and May 2024, involving 220 patients (106 non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 42 Hodgkin lymphoma); all data underwent ethical review and were rigorously de-identified. Complete 3D structural information was preserved during data acquisition, preprocessing and annotation, and a high-quality dataset was constructed based on the nnUNet format. By systematic technical validation and evaluation of the preprocessing process, annotation quality and automatic segmentation algorithm, the deep learning model trained based on this dataset is verified to achieve accurate segmentation of lymphoma lesions in PET/CT images with high accuracy, good robustness and reproducibility, which proves the applicability and stability of this dataset in accurate segmentation and quantitative analysis. The deep fusion of PET/CT images achieved with this dataset not only significantly improves the accurate portrayal of the morphology, location and metabolic features of tumour lesions, but also provides solid data support for early diagnosis, clinical staging and personalized treatment, and promotes the development of automated image segmentation and precision medicine based on deep learning.

Title: Full-field surrogate modeling of cardiac function encoding geometric variability
Authors: Elena Martinez, Beatrice Moscoloni, Matteo Salvador, Fanwei Kong, Mathias Peirlinck, Alison Lesley Marsden
Abstract: Combining physics-based modeling with data-driven methods is critical to enabling the translation of computational methods to clinical use in cardiology. The use of rigorous differential equations combined with machine learning tools allows for model personalization with uncertainty quantification in time frames compatible with clinical practice. However, accurate and efficient surrogate models of cardiac function, built from physics-based numerical simulation, are still mostly geometry-specific and require retraining for different patients and pathological conditions. We propose a novel computational pipeline to embed cardiac anatomies into full-field surrogate models. We generate a dataset of electrophysiology simulations using a complex multi-scale mathematical model coupling partial and ordinary differential equations. We adopt Branched Latent Neural Maps (BLNMs) as an effective scientific machine learning method to encode activation maps extracted from physics-based numerical simulations into a neural network. Leveraging large deformation diffeomorphic metric mappings, we build a biventricular anatomical atlas and parametrize the anatomical variability of a small and challenging cohort of 13 pediatric patients affected by Tetralogy of Fallot. We propose a novel statistical shape modeling based z-score sampling approach to generate a new synthetic cohort of 52 biventricular geometries that are compatible with the original geometrical variability. This synthetic cohort acts as the training set for BLNMs. Our surrogate model demonstrates robustness and great generalization across the complex original patient cohort, achieving an average adimensional mean squared error of 0.0034. The Python implementation of our BLNM model is publicly available under MIT License at this https URL.

Title: SAM-Guided Robust Representation Learning for One-Shot 3D Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Jia Wang, Yunan Mei, Jiarui Liu, Xin Fan
Abstract: One-shot medical image segmentation (MIS) is crucial for medical analysis due to the burden of medical experts on manual annotation. The recent emergence of the segment anything model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable adaptation in MIS but cannot be directly applied to one-shot medical image segmentation (MIS) due to its reliance on labor-intensive user interactions and the high computational cost. To cope with these limitations, we propose a novel SAM-guided robust representation learning framework, named RRL-MedSAM, to adapt SAM to one-shot 3D MIS, which exploits the strong generalization capabilities of the SAM encoder to learn better feature representation. We devise a dual-stage knowledge distillation (DSKD) strategy to distill general knowledge between natural and medical images from the foundation model to train a lightweight encoder, and then adopt a mutual exponential moving average (mutual-EMA) to update the weights of the general lightweight encoder and medical-specific encoder. Specifically, pseudo labels from the registration network are used to perform mutual supervision for such two encoders. Moreover, we introduce an auto-prompting (AP) segmentation decoder which adopts the mask generated from the general lightweight model as a prompt to assist the medical-specific model in boosting the final segmentation performance. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets, i.e., OASIS, CT-lung demonstrate that the proposed RRL-MedSAM outperforms state-of-the-art one-shot MIS methods for both segmentation and registration tasks. Especially, our lightweight encoder uses only 3\% of the parameters compared to the encoder of SAM-Base.

Title: Quality-factor inspired deep neural network solver for solving inverse scattering problems
Authors: Yutong Du, Zicheng Liu, Miao Cao, Zupeng Liang, Yali Zong, Changyou Li
Abstract: Deep neural networks have been applied to address electromagnetic inverse scattering problems (ISPs) and shown superior imaging performances, which can be affected by the training dataset, the network architecture and the applied loss function. Here, the quality of data samples is cared and valued by the defined quality factor. Based on the quality factor, the composition of the training dataset is optimized. The network architecture is integrated with the residual connections and channel attention mechanism to improve feature extraction. A loss function that incorporates data-fitting error, physical-information constraints and the desired feature of the solution is designed and analyzed to suppress the background artifacts and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Various numerical analysis are performed to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed quality-factor inspired deep neural network (QuaDNN) solver and the imaging performance is finally verified by experimental imaging test.

Title: Distributed U6G ELAA Communication Systems: Channel Measurement and Small-Scale Fading Characterization
Authors: Jiachen Tian, Zhengtao Jin, Xiayang Chen, Yu Han, Shi Jin, Wenjin Wang, Chao-Kai Wen
Abstract: The distributed upper 6 GHz (U6G) extra-large scale antenna array (ELAA) is a key enabler for future wireless communication systems, offering higher throughput and wider coverage, similar to existing ELAA systems, while effectively mitigating unaffordable complexity and hardware overhead. Uncertain channel characteristics, however, present significant bottleneck problems that hinder the hardware structure and algorithm design of the distributed U6G ELAA system. In response, we construct a U6G channel sounder and carry out extensive measurement campaigns across various typical scenarios. Initially, U6G channel characteristics, particularly small-scale fading characteristics, are unveiled and compared across different scenarios. Subsequently, the U6G ELAA channel characteristics are analyzed using a virtual array comprising 64 elements. Furthermore, inspired by the potential for distributed processing, we investigate U6G ELAA channel characteristics from the perspectives of subarrays and sub-bands, including subarray-wise nonstationarities, consistencies, far-field approximations, and sub-band characteristics. Through a combination of analysis and measurement validation, several insights and benefits, particularly suitable for distributed processing in U6G ELAA systems, are revealed, which provides practical validation for the deployment of U6G ELAA systems.

Title: Histogram-Probabilistic Multi-Hypothesis Tracking with Integrated Target Existence
Authors: Lukas Herrmann, Ángel F. García-Fernández, Edmund F. Brekke
Abstract: The histogram-probabilistic multi-hypothesis tracker (H-PMHT) is a parametric approach to solving the multi-target track-before-detect (TBD) problem, using expectation maximisation (EM). A key limitation of this method is the assumption of a known and constant number of targets. In this paper, we propose the integrated existence Poisson histogram probabilistic multi-hypothesis tracker (IE-PHPMHT), for TBD of multiple targets. It extends the H-PMHT framework by adding a probability of existence to each potential target. For the derivation, we utilise a Poisson point process (PPP) measurement model and Bernoulli targets, allowing for a multi-Bernoulli birth process and an unknown, time-varying number of targets. Hence, integrated track management is achieved through the discrimination of track quality assessments based on existence probabilities. The algorithm is evaluated in a simulation study of two scenarios and is compared with several other algorithms, demonstrating its performance.

Title: Physics-Informed Neural Network for Parameter Identification: a Buck Converter Case Study
Authors: Shuyu Ou, Subham Sahoo, Ariya Sangwongwanich, Frede Blaabjerg, Mahyar Hassanifar, Martin Votava, Marius Langwasser, Marco Liserre
Abstract: System-level condition monitoring methods estimate the electrical parameters of multiple components in a converter to assess their health status. The estimation accuracy and variation can differ significantly across parameters. For instance, inductance estimations are generally more accurate and stable than inductor resistance in a buck converter. However, these performance differences remain to be analyzed with a more systematic approach otherwise the condition monitoring results can be unreliable. Therefore, this paper analyzes the training loss landscape against multiple parameters of a buck converter to provide a systematic explanation of different performances. If the training loss is high and smooth, the estimated circuit parameter typically is accurate and has low variation. Furthermore, a novel physics-informed neural network (PINN) is proposed, offering faster convergence and lower computation requirements compared to an existing PINN method. The proposed method is validated through simulations, where the loss landscape identifies the unreliable parameter estimations, and the PINN can estimate the remaining parameters.

Title: Safe Bottom-Up Flexibility Provision from Distributed Energy Resources
Authors: Costas Mylonas, Emmanouel Varvarigos, Georgios Tsaousoglou
Abstract: Modern renewables-based power systems need to tap on the flexibility of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) connected to distribution networks. It is important, however, that DER owners/users remain in control of their assets, decisions, and objectives. At the same time, the dynamic landscape of DER-penetrated distribution networks calls for agile, data-driven flexibility management frameworks. In the face of these developments, the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) paradigm is gaining significant attention, as a distributed and data-driven decision-making policy. This paper addresses the need for bottom-up DER management decisions to account for the distribution network's safety-related constraints. While the related literature on safe MARL typically assumes that network characteristics are available and incorporated into the policy's safety layer, which implies active DSO engagement, this paper ensures that self-organized DER communities are enabled to provide distribution-network-safe flexibility services without relying on the aspirational and problematic requirement of bringing the DSO in the decision-making loop.

Title: Sense-then-Charge: Wireless Power Transfer to Unresponsive Devices with Unknown Location
Authors: Amirhossein Azarbahram, Onel L. A. López, Richard D. Souza, Petar Popovski, Matti Latva-aho
Abstract: This paper explores a multi-antenna dual-functional radio frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) and radar system to charge multiple unresponsive devices. We formulate a beamforming problem to maximize the minimum received power at the devices without prior location and channel state information (CSI) knowledge. We propose dividing transmission blocks into sensing and charging phases. First, the location of the devices is estimated by sending sensing signals and performing multiple signal classification and least square estimation on the received echo. Then, the estimations are used for CSI prediction and RF-WPT beamforming. Simulation results reveal that there is an optimal number of blocks allocated for sensing and charging depending on the system setup. Our sense-then-charge (STC) protocol can outperform CSI-free benchmarks and achieve near-optimal performance with a sufficient number of receive antennas and transmit power. However, STC struggles if using insufficient antennas or power as device numbers grow.

Title: Communications-Centric Secure ISAC with Hybrid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces
Authors: Ioannis Gavras, George C. Alexandropoulos
Abstract: Hybrid reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (HRISs) constitute an emerging paradigm of metasurfaces that empowers the concept of smart wireless environments, inherently supporting simultaneously communications and sensing. Very recently, some preliminary HRIS designs for Integrated Sensing And Communications (ISAC) have appeared, however, secure ISAC schemes are still lacking. In this paper, we present a novel communications-centric secure ISAC framework capitalizing on the dual-functional capability of HRISs to realize bistatic sensing simultaneously with secure downlink communications. In particular, we jointly optimize the BS precoding vector and the HRIS reflection and analog combining configurations to enable simultaneous accurate estimation of both a legitimate user and an eavesdropper, while guaranteeing a predefined threshold for the secrecy spectral efficiency, with both operations focused within an area of interest. The presented simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed secure ISAC design, highlighting the interplay among key system design parameters as well as quantifying the trade-offs between the HRIS's absorption and reflection coeffcients.

Title: Cell-free Fluid Antenna Multiple Access Networks
Authors: Tianyu Han, Yongxu Zhu, Kai-Kit Wong, Gan Zheng, Hyundong Shin
Abstract: Fluid antenna enables position reconfigurability that gives transceiver access to a high-resolution spatial signal and the ability to avoid interference through the ups and downs of fading channels. Previous studies investigated this fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA) approach in a single-cell setup only. In this paper, we consider a cell-free network architecture in which users are associated with the nearest base stations (BSs) and all users share the same physical channel. Each BS has multiple fixed antennas that employ maximum ratio transmission (MRT) to beam to its associated users while each user relies on its fluid antenna system (FAS) on one radio frequency (RF) chain to overcome the inter-user interference. Our aim is to analyze the outage probability performance of such cell-free FAMA network when both large- and small-scale fading effects are considered. To do so, we derive the distribution of the received \textcolor{black}{magnitude} for a typical user and then the interference distribution under both fast and slow port switching techniques. The outage probability is finally obtained in integral form in each case. Numerical results demonstrate that in an interference-limited situation, although fast port switching is typically understood as the superior method for FAMA, slow port switching emerges as a more effective solution when there is a large antenna array at the BS. Moreover, it is revealed that FAS at each user can serve to greatly reduce the burden of BS in terms of both antenna costs and CSI estimation overhead, thereby enhancing the scalability of cell-free networks.

Title: ISDrama: Immersive Spatial Drama Generation through Multimodal Prompting
Authors: Yu Zhang, Wenxiang Guo, Changhao Pan, Zhiyuan Zhu, Tao Jin, Zhou Zhao
Abstract: Multimodal immersive spatial drama generation focuses on creating continuous multi-speaker binaural speech with dramatic prosody based on multimodal prompts, with potential applications in AR, VR, and others. This task requires simultaneous modeling of spatial information and dramatic prosody based on multimodal inputs, with high data collection costs. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to address these challenges. We construct MRSDrama, the first multimodal recorded spatial drama dataset, containing binaural drama audios, scripts, videos, geometric poses, and textual prompts. Then, we propose ISDrama, the first immersive spatial drama generation model through multimodal prompting. ISDrama comprises these primary components: 1) Multimodal Pose Encoder, based on contrastive learning, considering the Doppler effect caused by moving speakers to extract unified pose information from multimodal prompts. 2) Immersive Drama Transformer, a flow-based mamba-transformer model that generates high-quality drama, incorporating Drama-MOE to select proper experts for enhanced prosody and pose control. We also design a context-consistent classifier-free guidance strategy to coherently generate complete drama. Experimental results show that ISDrama outperforms baseline models on objective and subjective metrics. The demos and dataset are available at this https URL.

Title: Disjoint Delay-Doppler Estimation in OTFS ISAC with Deep Learning-aided Path Detection
Authors: Mauro Marchese, Musa Furkan Keskin, Pietro Savazzi, Henk Wymeersch
Abstract: In this work, the problem of communication and radar sensing in orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) with reduced cyclic prefix (RCP) is addressed. A monostatic integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system is developed and, it is demonstrated that by leveraging the cyclic shift property inherent in the RCP, a delay-Doppler (DD) channel matrix that encapsulates the effects of propagation delays and Doppler shifts through unitary matrices can be derived. Consequently, a novel low-complexity correlation-based algorithm performing disjoint delay-Doppler estimation is proposed for channel estimation. Subsequently, this estimation approach is adapted to perform radar sensing on backscattered data frames. Moreover, channel estimation is complemented by a deep learning (DL) architecture that improves path detection and accuracy under low signal- to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, compared to stopping crite- rion (SC) based multipath detection. Simulation results indicate that the proposed estimation scheme achieves lower normalized mean squared error (NMSE) compared to conventional channel estimation algorithms and sensing performance close to the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Furthermore, an iterative data detection algorithm based on matched filter (MF) and combining is developed by exploiting the unitary property of delay-Doppler parameterized matrices. Simulation results reveal that this iterative scheme achieves performance comparable to that of the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) estimator while significantly reducing computational complexity.

Title: Parametrized Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces for Bistatic Integrated Sensing and Communications
Authors: Kuranage Roche Rayan Ranasinghe, Iván Alexander Morales Sandoval, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, George C. Alexandropoulos
Abstract: We consider stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) as a tool to improve the performance of bistatic integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) schemes. To that end, we optimize the SIMs and design a radar parameter estimation (RPE) scheme aimed at enhancing radar sensing capabilities as well as communication performance under ISAC-enabling waveforms known to perform well in doubly-dispersive (DD) channels. The SIM optimization is done via a min-max problem formulation solved via steepest ascent with closed-form gradients, while the RPE is carried out via a compressed sensing-based probabilistic data association (PDA) algorithm. Our numerical results indicate that the design of waveforms suitable to mitigating the effects of DD channels is significantly impacted by the emerging SIM technology.

Title: A Decentralized Local Flexibility Market for Local Energy Communities to Mitigate Grid Congestion: A Case Study in Sweden
Authors: Maryam Mohiti, Mohammadreza Mazidi, David Steen, Le Anh Tuan
Abstract: This paper proposes a preventive congestion management framework with joint Local Flexibility Capacity Market (LFCM) and Local Energy Markets (LEMs). The framework enables Local Energy Communities (LECs) to optimize their flexibility potential across the LEM, LFCM, and heat markets. The LECs utilize their heat and electricity resources to offer flexibility services to Distribution System Operators (DSOs) for congestion relief. In this framework, energy and flexibility are treated as separate variables, each subject to different pricing scheme. Flexibility prices are market-driven, dynamically reflecting the location and severity of congestion. A case study conducted at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, shows that the proposed framework can effectively mitigate congestion by trading the LECs flexibility in the LFCM. The study also highlights up to 40% financial benefits for LECs, promoting the LFCM as a viable solution for congestion management in future decentralized energy systems.

Title: Performance Evaluation of Efficient Hybrid Compression Methods For Devanagiri-Encoded Hindi Text Using Lossless Algorithms
Authors: Mukesh Sahu, Jeebananda Panda
Abstract: This research paper provides a comprehensive performance analysis of five standard lossless compression algorithms-LZMA, Zstd, Brotli, Bzip2, and LZ4HC-alongside sixty hybrid combinations on UTF-8 encoded Hindi text datasets, written in the Devanagari script, across varying sizes-small, medium, and large. The evaluation covers compression ratio, compression speed, decompression speed, and a derived weighted normalized efficiency score. Hybrid algorithms-especially those combining Zstd with LZ4HC or Brotli-demonstrate superior performance across all individual parameters. Independent Zstd achieves the highest efficiency score for the medium-sized dataset, illustrating how a well-balanced algorithm can excel in overall efficiency despite not leading in any single metric. However, in terms of compression ratio, speed, and decompression speed, hybrid methods consistently outperform standalone approaches. Notably, the hybrid combination Zstd + LZ4HC achieves the highest efficiency, with scores of 0.6764 for small files and 0.8597 for large files. Independent algorithms such as Zstd and Bzip2 perform well but are consistently surpassed by strategic hybrid pairings. The analysis underscores the significance of combining fast and high-ratio compression techniques, particularly for language-specific data. However, not all hybrids yielded significant improvements, with some introducing computational overhead. This comparative analysis highlights the potential of hybrid compression in applications such as cloud storage, mobile messaging, and NLP-based Hindi text processing.

Title: An Online Cross-layered Defense Strategy with Bandwidth Allocation for Multi-channel Systems under DoS Attacks
Authors: Liheng Wan, Panshuo Li, James Lam
Abstract: This paper proposes an online cross-layered defense strategy for multi-channel systems with switched dynamics under DoS attacks. The enabling condition of a channel under attacks is formulated with respect to attack flow and channel bandwidth, then a new networked control system model bridging the gap between system dynamics and network deployment is built. Based on this, the cross-layered defense strategy is proposed. It jointly optimizes the controller gain and bandwidth allocation of channels according to the real-time attack flow and system dynamics, by solving a mixed-integer semidefinite programming online. A smart enumeration algorithm for non-convex bi-level optimization is proposed to analyze the stability under the strategy. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the high resilience from the cross-layered feature.

Title: Bayesian Deep End-to-End Learning for MIMO-OFDM System with Delay-Domain Sparse Precoder
Authors: Nilesh Kumar Jha, Huayan Guo, Vincent K. N. Lau
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel precoder design aimed at reducing pilot overhead for effective channel estimation in multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) applications utilizing high-order modulation. We propose an innovative demodulation reference signal scheme that achieves up to an 8x reduction in overhead by implementing a delay-domain sparsity constraint on the precoder. Furthermore, we present a deep neural network (DNN)-based end-to-end architecture that integrates a propagation channel estimation module, a precoder design module, and an effective channel estimation module. Additionally, we propose a Bayesian model-assisted training framework that incorporates domain knowledge, resulting in an interpretable datapath design. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed solution significantly outperforms various baseline schemes while exhibiting substantially lower computational complexity.

Title: Periodic Proprioceptive Stimuli Learning and Internal Model Development for Avian-inspired Flapping-wing Flight State Estimation
Authors: Chen Qian, Jiaxi Xing, Jifu Yan, Mingyu Luo, Shiyu Song, Xuyi Lian, Yongchun Fang, Fei Gao, Tiefeng Li
Abstract: This paper presents a novel learning-based approach for online state estimation in flapping wing aerial vehicles (FWAVs). Leveraging low-cost Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity (MARG) sensors, the proposed method effectively mitigates the adverse effects of flapping-induced oscillations that challenge conventional estimation techniques. By employing a divide-and-conquer strategy grounded in cycle-averaged aerodynamics, the framework decouples the slow-varying components from the high-frequency oscillatory components, thereby preserving crit- ical transient behaviors while delivering an smooth inter- nal state representation. The complete oscillatory state of FWAV can be reconstructed based on above two components, leading to substantial improvements in accurate state prediction. Experimental validations on an avian-inspired FWAV demonstrate that the estimator enhances accuracy and smoothness, even under complex aerodynamic disturbances. These encouraging results highlight the potential of learning algorithms to overcome issues of flapping-wing induced oscillation dynamics.

Title: Non-Linear Modeling and Analysis of Amplifier-Less Potentiostat Architectures
Authors: Andrea Sannino, David-Peter Wiens, Maurits Ortmanns, José I. Artigas, Aránzazu Otín
Abstract: In this article, a previously published amplifier-less potentiostat architecture is further examined. Starting with a linearized model, the impact of the most important parameters is studied taking in account the electrodes-solution electrochemical interface. A detailed model is obtained and thoroughly verified, and recommended operating conditions are given for certain limit load conditions. Then, a more complete non-linear model is developed to take in account the measurement uncertainty introduced by the circuit non-linear components. This non-linear model is compared to a time domain description of the circuit and it is verified that it can predict the non-linear behavior with a precision better than 20%. This result enables the circuit designers to compensate for these effects and ultimately reduce the overall measurement uncertainty.

Title: Imaging on the Edge: Mapping Object Corners and Edges with Stereo X-ray Tomography
Authors: Zhenduo Shang, Thomas Blumensath
Abstract: X-ray computed tomography is a powerful tool for volumetric imaging, where three-dimensional (3D) images are generated from a large number of individual X-ray projection images. Collecting the required number of low noise projection images is however time-consuming and so the technique is not currently applicable when spatial information needs to be collected with high temporal resolution, such as in the study of dynamic processes. In our previous work, inspired by stereo vision, we developed stereo X-ray imaging methods that operate with only two X-ray projection images. Previously we have shown how this allowed us to map point and line fiducial markers into 3D space at significantly faster temporal resolutions. In this paper, we make two further contributions. Firstly, instead of utilising internal fiducial markers, we demonstrate the applicability of the method to the 3D mapping of sharp object corners, a problem of interest in measuring the deformation of manufactured components under different loads. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the approach can be applied to real stereo X-ray data, even in settings where we do not have the annotated real training data that was required for the training of our previous Machine Learning approach. This is achieved by substituting the real data with a relatively simple synthetic training dataset designed to mimic key aspects of the real data.

Title: Exploiting inter-agent coupling information for efficient reinforcement learning of cooperative LQR
Authors: Shahbaz P Qadri Syed, He Bai
Abstract: Developing scalable and efficient reinforcement learning algorithms for cooperative multi-agent control has received significant attention over the past years. Existing literature has proposed inexact decompositions of local Q-functions based on empirical information structures between the agents. In this paper, we exploit inter-agent coupling information and propose a systematic approach to exactly decompose the local Q-function of each agent. We develop an approximate least square policy iteration algorithm based on the proposed decomposition and identify two architectures to learn the local Q-function for each agent. We establish that the worst-case sample complexity of the decomposition is equal to the centralized case and derive necessary and sufficient graphical conditions on the inter-agent couplings to achieve better sample efficiency. We demonstrate the improved sample efficiency and computational efficiency on numerical examples.

Authors: S. Barja-Martinez, M. Aragues-Penalba, A. Sumper, R. Villafafila-Robles
Abstract: Local Energy Communities (LECs) facilitate consumer involvement in local electricity generation and distribution, offering a significant opportunity for society to participate in the energy transition. This paper presents the optimization of a renewable energy community in Spain, consisting of four office buildings, a collectively owned centralized photovoltaic system, and a Li-ion battery storage system. The case study assesses the performance and feasibility of the proposed solutions. The results indicate a 6% reduction in emissions and a 20% reduction in electricity costs, demonstrating the potential of LECs to enhance energy security by saving costs and emission while mitigating the vulnerability of local areas to power outages and disruptions

Title: Tempo: Application-aware LLM Serving with Mixed SLO Requirements
Authors: Wei Zhang, Zhiyu Wu, Yi Mu, Banruo Liu, Myungjin Lee, Fan Lai
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into diverse applications, ranging from interactive chatbots and cloud AIOps to intelligent agents, has introduced a wide spectrum of Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for responsiveness. These workloads include latency-sensitive requests focused on per-token latency in streaming chat, throughput-intensive requests that require rapid full responses to invoke tools, and collective requests with dynamic dependencies arising from self-reflection or agent-based reasoning. This workload diversity, amplified by unpredictable request information such as response lengths and runtime dependencies, makes existing schedulers inadequate even within their design envelopes. In this paper, we define service gain as the useful service delivered by completing requests. We observe that as SLO directly reflects the actual performance needs of requests, completing a request much faster than its SLO (e.g., deadline) yields limited additional service gain. Based on this insight, we introduce Tempo, the first systematic SLO-aware scheduler designed to maximize service gain across diverse LLM workloads. Tempo allocates just enough serving bandwidth to meet each SLO, maximizing residual capacity for others best-effort workloads. Instead of assuming request information or none at all, it adopts a hybrid scheduling strategy: using quantile-based response upper bounds and dependency-graph matching for conservative initial estimates, prioritizing requests by service gain density, and refining decisions online as generation progresses. Our evaluation across diverse workloads, including chat, reasoning, and agentic pipelines, shows that Tempo improves end-to-end service gain by up to 8.3$\times$ and achieves up to 10.3$\times$ SLO goodput compared to state-of-the-art designs

Title: Swapped Logit Distillation via Bi-level Teacher Alignment
Authors: Stephen Ekaputra Limantoro, Jhe-Hao Lin, Chih-Yu Wang, Yi-Lung Tsai, Hong-Han Shuai, Ching-Chun Huang, Wen-Huang Cheng
Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) compresses the network capacity by transferring knowledge from a large (teacher) network to a smaller one (student). It has been mainstream that the teacher directly transfers knowledge to the student with its original distribution, which can possibly lead to incorrect predictions. In this article, we propose a logit-based distillation via swapped logit processing, namely Swapped Logit Distillation (SLD). SLD is proposed under two assumptions: (1) the wrong prediction occurs when the prediction label confidence is not the maximum; (2) the "natural" limit of probability remains uncertain as the best value addition to the target cannot be determined. To address these issues, we propose a swapped logit processing scheme. Through this approach, we find that the swap method can be effectively extended to teacher and student outputs, transforming into two teachers. We further introduce loss scheduling to boost the performance of two teachers' alignment. Extensive experiments on image classification tasks demonstrate that SLD consistently performs best among previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: For the upcoming 6G wireless networks, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces are an essential technology, enabling dynamic beamforming and signal manipulation in both reflective and transmissive modes. It is expected to utilize frequency bands in the millimeter-wave and THz, which presents unique opportunities but also significant challenges. The selection of switching technologies that can support high-frequency operation with minimal loss and high efficiency is particularly complex. In this work, we demonstrate the potential of advanced components such as Schottky diodes, memristor switches, liquid metal-based switches, phase change materials, and RF-SOI technology in RIS designs as an alternative to overcome limitations inherent in traditional technologies in D-band (110-170 GHz).

Authors: Weihao Sun, Heeseung Bang, Andreas A. Malikopoulos
Abstract: In this paper, we present an adherence-aware reinforcement learning (RL) approach aimed at seeking optimal lane-changing recommendations within a semi-autonomous driving environment to enhance a single vehicle's travel efficiency. The problem is framed within a Markov decision process setting and is addressed through an adherence-aware deep Q network, which takes into account the partial compliance of human drivers with the recommended actions. This approach is evaluated within CARLA's driving environment under realistic scenarios.

Authors: Vladyslav Polushko, Damjan Hatic, Ronald Rösch, Thomas März, Markus Rauhut, Andreas Weinmann
Abstract: Floods cause serious problems around the world. Responding quickly and effectively requires accurate and timely information about the affected areas. The effective use of Remote Sensing images for accurate flood detection requires specific detection methods. Typically, Deep Neural Networks are employed, which are trained on specific datasets. For the purpose of river flood detection in RGB imagery, we use the BlessemFlood21 dataset. We here explore the use of different augmentation strategies, ranging from basic approaches to more complex techniques, including optical distortion. By identifying effective strategies, we aim to refine the training process of state-of-the-art Deep Learning segmentation networks.

Title: Generative Diffusion Models for Resource Allocation in Wireless Networks
Authors: Yigit Berkay Uslu, Samar Hadou, Shirin Saeedi Bidokhti, Alejandro Ribeiro
Abstract: This paper proposes a supervised training algorithm for learning stochastic resource allocation policies with generative diffusion models (GDMs). We formulate the allocation problem as the maximization of an ergodic utility function subject to ergodic Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. Given samples from a stochastic expert policy that yields a near-optimal solution to the problem, we train a GDM policy to imitate the expert and generate new samples from the optimal distribution. We achieve near-optimal performance through sequential execution of the generated samples. To enable generalization to a family of network configurations, we parameterize the backward diffusion process with a graph neural network (GNN) architecture. We present numerical results in a case study of power control in multi-user interference networks.

Title: Computation of Capacity-Distortion-Cost Functions for Continuous Memoryless Channels
Authors: Xinyang Li, Ziyou Tang, Vlad C. Andrei, Ullrich J. Mönich, Fan Liu, Holger Boche
Abstract: This paper aims at computing the capacity-distortion-cost (CDC) function for continuous memoryless channels, which is defined as the supremum of the mutual information between channel input and output, constrained by an input cost and an expected distortion of estimating channel state. Solving the optimization problem is challenging because the input distribution does not lie in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space and the optimal estimation function has no closed form in general. We propose to adopt the Wasserstein proximal point method and parametric models such as neural networks (NNs) to update the input distribution and estimation function alternately. To implement it in practice, the importance sampling (IS) technique is used to calculate integrals numerically, and the Wasserstein gradient descent is approximated by pushing forward particles. The algorithm is then applied to an integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system, validating theoretical results at minimum and maximum distortion as well as the random-deterministic trade-off.

Title: System Identification of Thrust and Torque Characteristics for a Bipedal Robot with Integrated Propulsion
Authors: Thomas Cahill
Abstract: Bipedal robots represent a remarkable and sophisticated class of robotics, designed to emulate human form and movement. Their development marks a significant milestone in the field. However, even the most advanced bipedal robots face challenges related to terrain variation, obstacle negotiation, payload management, weight distribution, and recovering from stumbles. These challenges can be mitigated by incorporating thrusters, which enhance stability on uneven terrain, facilitate obstacle avoidance, and improve recovery after stumbling. Harpy is a bipedal robot equipped with six joints and two thrusters, serving as a hardware platform for implementing and testing advanced control algorithms. This thesis focuses on characterizing Harpy's hardware to improve the system's overall robustness, controllability, and predictability. It also examines simulation results for predicting thrust in propeller-based mechanisms, the integration of thrusters into the Harpy platform and associated testing, as well as an exploration of motor torque characterization methods and their application to hardware in relation to closed-loop force-based impedance control.

Title: NMPC-based Unified Posture Manipulation and Thrust Vectoring for Agile and Fault-Tolerant Flight of a Morphing Aerial Robot
Authors: Shashwat Pandya
Abstract: This thesis presents a unified control framework for agile and fault-tolerant flight of the Multi-Modal Mobility Morphobot (M4) in aerial mode. The M4 robot is capable of transitioning between ground and aerial locomotion. The articulated legs enable more dynamic maneuvers than a standard quadrotor platform. A nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) approach is developed to simultaneously plan posture manipulation and thrust vectoring actions, allowing the robot to execute sharp turns and dynamic flight trajectories. The framework integrates an agile and fault-tolerant control logic that enables precise tracking under aggressive maneuvers while compensating for actuator failures, ensuring continued operation without significant performance degradation. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating accurate trajectory tracking and robust recovery from faults, contributing to resilient autonomous flight in complex environments.

Title: CarbonCall: Sustainability-Aware Function Calling for Large Language Models on Edge Devices
Authors: Varatheepan Paramanayakam, Andreas Karatzas, Iraklis Anagnostopoulos, Dimitrios Stamoulis
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable real-time function calling in edge AI systems but introduce significant computational overhead, leading to high power consumption and carbon emissions. Existing methods optimize for performance while neglecting sustainability, making them inefficient for energy-constrained environments. We introduce CarbonCall, a sustainability-aware function-calling framework that integrates dynamic tool selection, carbon-aware execution, and quantized LLM adaptation. CarbonCall adjusts power thresholds based on real-time carbon intensity forecasts and switches between model variants to sustain high tokens-per-second throughput under power constraints. Experiments on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin show that CarbonCall reduces carbon emissions by up to 52%, power consumption by 30%, and execution time by 30%, while maintaining high efficiency.

Title: Neural Stereo Video Compression with Hybrid Disparity Compensation
Authors: Shiyin Jiang, Zhenghao Chen, Minghao Han, Xingyu Zhou, Leheng Zhang, Shuhang Gu
Abstract: Disparity compensation represents the primary strategy in stereo video compression (SVC) for exploiting cross-view redundancy. These mechanisms can be broadly categorized into two types: one that employs explicit horizontal shifting, and another that utilizes an implicit cross-attention mechanism to reduce cross-view disparity redundancy. In this work, we propose a hybrid disparity compensation (HDC) strategy that leverages explicit pixel displacement as a robust prior feature to simplify optimization and perform implicit cross-attention mechanisms for subsequent warping operations, thereby capturing a broader range of disparity information. Specifically, HDC first computes a similarity map by fusing the horizontally shifted cross-view features to capture pixel displacement information. This similarity map is then normalized into an "explicit pixel-wise attention score" to perform the cross-attention mechanism, implicitly aligning features from one view to another. Building upon HDC, we introduce a novel end-to-end optimized neural stereo video compression framework, which integrates HDC-based modules into key coding operations, including cross-view feature extraction and reconstruction (HDC-FER) and cross-view entropy modeling (HDC-EM). Extensive experiments on SVC benchmarks, including KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, and Nagoya, which cover both autonomous driving and general scenes, demonstrate that our framework outperforms both neural and traditional SVC methodologies.

Title: Safe and Optimal N-Spacecraft Swarm Reconfiguration in Non-Keplerian Cislunar Orbits
Authors: Yuji Takubo, Walter Manuel, Ethan Foss, Simone D'Amico
Abstract: This paper presents a novel fuel-optimal guidance and control methodology for spacecraft swarm reconfiguration in Restricted Multi-Body Problems (RMBPs) with a guarantee of passive safety, maintaining miss distance even under abrupt loss of control authority. A new set of constraints exploits a quasi-periodic structure of RMBPs to guarantee passive safety. Particularly, this can be expressed as simple geometric constraints by solving optimal control in Local Toroidal Coordinates, which is based on a local eigenspace of a quasi-periodic motion around the corresponding periodic orbit. The proposed formulation enables a significant simplification of problem structure, which is highly applicable to large-scale swarm reconfiguration in cislunar orbits. The method is demonstrated in various models of RMBPs (Elliptical Restricted Three-Body Problem and Bi-Circular Restricted Four-Body Problem) and also validated in the full-ephemeris dynamics. By extending and generalizing well-known concepts from the two- to the three- and four-body problems, this paper lays the foundation for the practical control schemes of relative motion in cislunar space.

Title: Terahertz Wireless Data Center: Gaussian Beam or Airy Beam?
Authors: Wenqi Zhao, Sergi Abadal, Guochao Song, Jiamo Jiang, Chong Han
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communication is emerging as a pivotal enabler for 6G and beyond wireless systems owing to its multi-GHz bandwidth. One of its novel applications is in wireless data centers, where it enables ultra-high data rates while enhancing network reconfigurability and scalability. However, due to numerous racks, supporting walls, and densely deployed antennas, the line-of-sight (LoS) path in data centers is often instead of fully obstructed, resulting in quasi-LoS propagation and degradation of spectral efficiency. To address this issue, Airy beam-based hybrid beamforming is investigated in this paper as a promising technique to mitigate quasi-LoS propagation and enhance spectral efficiency in THz wireless data centers. Specifically, a cascaded geometrical and wave-based channel model (CGWCM) is proposed for quasi-LoS scenarios, which accounts for diffraction effects while being more simplified than conventional wave-based model. Then, the characteristics and generation of the Airy beam are analyzed, and beam search methods for quasi-LoS scenarios are proposed, including hierarchical focusing-Airy beam search, and low-complexity beam search. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the CGWCM and demonstrate the superiority of the Airy beam over Gaussian beams in mitigating blockages, verifying its potential for practical THz wireless communication in data centers.

Title: A Geography-Inspired and Self-Adaptive Clustering Algorithm: A Study in Channel Measurement
Authors: Yiqin Wang, Chong Han
Abstract: The phenomenon that multi-path components (MPCs) arrive in clusters has been verified by channel measurements, and is widely adopted by cluster-based channel models. As a crucial intermediate processing step, MPC clustering bridges raw data in channel measurement and cluster characteristics for channel modeling. In this paper, a physical-interpretable and self-adaptive MPC clustering algorithm is proposed, which can locate both single-point and wide-spread scatterers without prior knowledge. Inspired by the concept in geography, a novel metaphor that interprets features of MPC attributes in the power-delay-angle profile (PDAP) as topographic concepts is developed. In light of the interpretation, the proposed algorithm disassembles the PDAP by constructing contour lines and identifying characteristic points that indicate the skeleton of MPC clusters, which are fitted by analytical models that associate MPCs with physical scatterer locations. Besides, a new clustering performance index, the power gradient consistency index, is proposed. Calculated as the weighted Spearman correlation coefficient between the power and the distance to the center, the index captures the intrinsic property of MPC clusters that the dominant high-power path is surrounded by lower-power paths. The performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed and compared with the counterparts of conventional clustering algorithms based on the channel measurement conducted in an outdoor scenario. The proposed algorithm performs better in average Silhouette index and weighted Spearman correlation coefficient, and the average root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimated scatterer location is 0.1 m.

Title: APG-MOS: Auditory Perception Guided-MOS Predictor for Synthetic Speech
Authors: Zhicheng Lian, Lizhi Wang, Hua Huang
Abstract: Automatic speech quality assessment aims to quantify subjective human perception of speech through computational models to reduce the need for labor-consuming manual evaluations. While models based on deep learning have achieved progress in predicting mean opinion scores (MOS) to assess synthetic speech, the neglect of fundamental auditory perception mechanisms limits consistency with human judgments. To address this issue, we propose an auditory perception guided-MOS prediction model (APG-MOS) that synergistically integrates auditory modeling with semantic analysis to enhance consistency with human judgments. Specifically, we first design a perceptual module, grounded in biological auditory mechanisms, to simulate cochlear functions, which encodes acoustic signals into biologically aligned electrochemical representations. Secondly, we propose a residual vector quantization (RVQ)-based semantic distortion modeling method to quantify the degradation of speech quality at the semantic level. Finally, we design a residual cross-attention architecture, coupled with a progressive learning strategy, to enable multimodal fusion of encoded electrochemical signals and semantic representations. Experiments demonstrate that APG-MOS achieves superior performance on two primary benchmarks. Our code and checkpoint will be available on a public repository upon publication.

Title: TriniMark: A Robust Generative Speech Watermarking Method for Trinity-Level Attribution
Authors: Yue Li, Weizhi Liu, Dongdong Lin
Abstract: The emergence of diffusion models has facilitated the generation of speech with reinforced fidelity and naturalness. While deepfake detection technologies have manifested the ability to identify AI-generated content, their efficacy decreases as generative models become increasingly sophisticated. Furthermore, current research in the field has not adequately addressed the necessity for robust watermarking to safeguard the intellectual property rights associated with synthetic speech and generative models. To remedy this deficiency, we propose a \textbf{ro}bust generative \textbf{s}peech wat\textbf{e}rmarking method (TriniMark) for authenticating the generated content and safeguarding the copyrights by enabling the traceability of the diffusion model. We first design a structure-lightweight watermark encoder that embeds watermarks into the time-domain features of speech and reconstructs the waveform directly. A temporal-aware gated convolutional network is meticulously designed in the watermark decoder for bit-wise watermark recovery. Subsequently, the waveform-guided fine-tuning strategy is proposed for fine-tuning the diffusion model, which leverages the transferability of watermarks and enables the diffusion model to incorporate watermark knowledge effectively. When an attacker trains a surrogate model using the outputs of the target model, the embedded watermark can still be learned by the surrogate model and correctly extracted. Comparative experiments with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the superior robustness of our method, particularly in countering compound attacks.

Title: Statistical Channel Based Low-Complexity Rotation and Position Optimization for 6D Movable Antennas Enabled Wireless Communication
Authors: Qijun Jiang, Xiaodan Shao, Rui Zhang
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is a promising technology to fully exploit spatial variation in wireless channels by allowing flexible adjustment of three-dimensional (3D) positions and rotations of antennas at the transceiver. In this paper, we investigate the practical low-complexity design of 6DMA-enabled communication systems, including transmission protocol, statistical channel information (SCI) acquisition, and joint position and rotation optimization of 6DMA surfaces based on the SCI of users. Specifically, an orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)-based algorithm is proposed for the estimation of SCI of users at all possible position-rotation pairs of 6DMA surfaces based on the channel measurements at a small subset of position-rotation pairs. Then, the average sum logarithmic rate of all users is maximized by jointly designing the positions and rotations of 6DMA surfaces based on their SCI acquired. Different from prior works on 6DMA which adopt alternating optimization to design 6DMA positions/rotations with iterations, we propose a new sequential optimization approach that first determines 6DMA rotations and then finds their feasible positions to realize the optimized rotations subject to practical antenna placement constraints. Simulation results show that the proposed sequential optimization significantly reduces the computational complexity of conventional alternating optimization, while achieving comparable communication performance. It is also shown that the proposed SCI-based 6DMA design can effectively enhance the communication throughput of wireless networks over existing fixed (position and rotation) antenna arrays, yet with a practically appealing low-complexity implementation.

Title: DiffusionRIR: Room Impulse Response Interpolation using Diffusion Models
Authors: Sagi Della Torre, Mirco Pezzoli, Fabio Antonacci, Sharon Gannot
Abstract: Room Impulse Responses (RIRs) characterize acoustic environments and are crucial in multiple audio signal processing tasks. High-quality RIR estimates drive applications such as virtual microphones, sound source localization, augmented reality, and data augmentation. However, obtaining RIR measurements with high spatial resolution is resource-intensive, making it impractical for large spaces or when dense sampling is required. This research addresses the challenge of estimating RIRs at unmeasured locations within a room using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM). Our method leverages the analogy between RIR matrices and image inpainting, transforming RIR data into a format suitable for diffusion-based reconstruction. Using simulated RIR data based on the image method, we demonstrate our approach's effectiveness on microphone arrays of different curvatures, from linear to semi-circular. Our method successfully reconstructs missing RIRs, even in large gaps between microphones. Under these conditions, it achieves accurate reconstruction, significantly outperforming baseline Spline Cubic Interpolation in terms of Normalized Mean Square Error and Cosine Distance between actual and interpolated RIRs. This research highlights the potential of using generative models for effective RIR interpolation, paving the way for generating additional data from limited real-world measurements.

Title: ComplexVCoder: An LLM-Driven Framework for Systematic Generation of Complex Verilog Code
Authors: Jian Zuo, Junzhe Liu, Xianyong Wang, Yicheng Liu, Navya Goli, Tong Xu, Hao Zhang, Umamaheswara Rao Tida, Zhenge Jia, Mengying Zhao
Abstract: Recent advances have demonstrated the promising capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in generating register-transfer level (RTL) code, such as Verilog. However, existing LLM-based frameworks still face significant challenges in accurately handling the complexity of real-world RTL designs, particularly those that are large-scale and involve multi-level module instantiations. To address this issue, we present ComplexVCoder, an open-source LLM-driven framework that enhances both the generation quality and efficiency of complex Verilog code. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage generation mechanism, which leverages an intermediate representation to enable a more accurate and structured transition from natural language descriptions to intricate Verilog designs. In addition, we introduce a rule-based alignment method and a domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to further improve the correctness of the synthesized code by incorporating relevant design knowledge during generation. To evaluate our approach, we construct a comprehensive dataset comprising 55 complex Verilog designs derived from real-world implementations. We also release an open-source benchmark suite for systematically assessing the quality of auto-generated RTL code together with the ComplexVCoder framework. Experimental results show that ComplexVCoder outperforms SOTA frameworks such as CodeV and RTLCoder by 14.6% and 22.2%, respectively, in terms of function correctness on complex Verilog benchmarks. Furthermore, ComplexVcoder achieves comparable generation performances in terms of functionality correctness using a lightweight 32B model (Qwen2.5), rivaling larger-scale models such as GPT-3.5 and DeepSeek-V3.

Title: Non-native Children's Automatic Speech Assessment Challenge (NOCASA)
Authors: Yaroslav Getman, Tamás Grósz, Mikko Kurimo, Giampiero Salvi
Abstract: This paper presents the "Non-native Children's Automatic Speech Assessment" (NOCASA) - a data competition part of the IEEE MLSP 2025 conference. NOCASA challenges participants to develop new systems that can assess single-word pronunciations of young second language (L2) learners as part of a gamified pronunciation training app. To achieve this, several issues must be addressed, most notably the limited nature of available training data and the highly unbalanced distribution among the pronunciation level categories. To expedite the development, we provide a pseudo-anonymized training data (TeflonNorL2), containing 10,334 recordings from 44 speakers attempting to pronounce 205 distinct Norwegian words, human-rated on a 1 to 5 scale (number of stars that should be given in the game). In addition to the data, two already trained systems are released as official baselines: an SVM classifier trained on the ComParE_16 acoustic feature set and a multi-task wav2vec 2.0 model. The latter achieves the best performance on the challenge test set, with an unweighted average recall (UAR) of 36.37%.

Title: Robust Recurrence of Discrete-Time Infinite-Horizon Stochastic Optimal Control with Discounted Cost
Authors: Robert H. Moldenhauer, Dragan Nešić, Mathieu Granzotto, Romain Postoyan, Andrew R. Teel
Abstract: We analyze the stability of general nonlinear discrete-time stochastic systems controlled by optimal inputs that minimize an infinite-horizon discounted cost. Under a novel stochastic formulation of cost-controllability and detectability assumptions inspired by the related literature on deterministic systems, we prove that uniform semi-global practical recurrence holds for the closed-loop system, where the adjustable parameter is the discount factor. Under additional continuity assumptions, we further prove that this property is robust.

Montoya, Andreas Triantafyllopoulos, Maxime Cauchoix
Abstract: Currently available tools for the automated acoustic recognition of European insects in natural soundscapes are limited in scope. Large and ecologically heterogeneous acoustic datasets are currently needed for these algorithms to cross-contextually recognize the subtle and complex acoustic signatures produced by each species, thus making the availability of such datasets a key requisite for their development. Here we present ECOSoundSet (European Cicadidae and Orthoptera Sound dataSet), a dataset containing 10,653 recordings of 200 orthopteran and 24 cicada species (217 and 26 respective taxa when including subspecies) present in North, Central, and temperate Western Europe (Andorra, Belgium, Denmark, mainland France and Corsica, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Switzerland), collected partly through targeted fieldwork in South France and Catalonia and partly through contributions from various European entomologists. The dataset is composed of a combination of coarsely labeled recordings, for which we can only infer the presence, at some point, of their target species (weak labeling), and finely annotated recordings, for which we know the specific time and frequency range of each insect sound present in the recording (strong labeling). We also provide a train/validation/test split of the strongly labeled recordings, with respective approximate proportions of 0.8, 0.1 and 0.1, in order to facilitate their incorporation in the training and evaluation of deep learning algorithms. This dataset could serve as a meaningful complement to recordings already available online for the training of deep learning algorithms for the acoustic classification of orthopterans and cicadas in North, Central, and temperate Western Europe.

Title: Enhancing Non-Core Language Instruction-Following in Speech LLMs via Semi-Implicit Cross-Lingual CoT Reasoning
Authors: Hongfei Xue, Yufeng Tang, Hexin Liu, Jun Zhang, Xuelong Geng, Lei Xie
Abstract: Large language models have been extended to the speech domain, leading to the development of speech large language models (SLLMs). While existing SLLMs demonstrate strong performance in speech instruction-following for core languages (e.g., English), they often struggle with non-core languages due to the scarcity of paired speech-text data and limited multilingual semantic reasoning capabilities. To address this, we propose the semi-implicit Cross-lingual Speech Chain-of-Thought (XS-CoT) framework, which integrates speech-to-text translation into the reasoning process of SLLMs. The XS-CoT generates four types of tokens: instruction and response tokens in both core and non-core languages, enabling cross-lingual transfer of reasoning capabilities. To mitigate inference latency in generating target non-core response tokens, we incorporate a semi-implicit CoT scheme into XS-CoT, which progressively compresses the first three types of intermediate reasoning tokens while retaining global reasoning logic during training. By leveraging the robust reasoning capabilities of the core language, XS-CoT improves responses for non-core languages by up to 45\% in GPT-4 score when compared to direct supervised fine-tuning on two representative SLLMs, Qwen2-Audio and SALMONN. Moreover, the semi-implicit XS-CoT reduces token delay by more than 50\% with a slight drop in GPT-4 scores. Importantly, XS-CoT requires only a small amount of high-quality training data for non-core languages by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of core languages. To support training, we also develop a data pipeline and open-source speech instruction-following datasets in Japanese, German, and French.

Title: On the Secrecy-Sensing Optimization of RIS-assisted Full-Duplex Integrated Sensing and Communication Network
Authors: Elmehdi Illi, Ahmad Bazzi, Marwa Qaraqe, Ali Ghrayeb
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has recently emerged as a viable technique for establishing sensing and communication using the same resources. Nonetheless, the operation of ISAC networks is often challenged by the absence of a direct link between the sensing node and the targets, and by the risk of disclosing confidential data to malicious targets when using the same signal for both tasks. In this paper, a robust reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided scheme for securing a full-duplex (FD) ISAC network is proposed. The considered network consists of uplink and downlink users served in FD through a multi-antenna dual-functional radar communication base station (BS), which employs co-located multi-antenna communication-radar arrays to detect multiple malicious targets while preserving communication secrecy in their presence. Additionally, the BS utilizes an optimized artificial noise (AN) that serves to disrupt the malicious targets' reception and increase the sensing power. By optimally designing the RIS phase shifts, transmit beamforming, AN covariance, and uplink users' transmit power and combining vectors using an alternating optimization-based algorithm, the network's sensing performance is maximized under secrecy and total power constraints. Numerical results present the proposed scheme's efficacy, particularly when a direct link between the BS and the various nodes/targets is absent.

Title: End-to-end Audio Deepfake Detection from RAW Waveforms: a RawNet-Based Approach with Cross-Dataset Evaluation
Authors: Andrea Di Pierno (1 and 2), Luca Guarnera (2), Dario Allegra (2), Sebastiano Battiato (2) ((1) IMT School of Advanced Studies, Lucca, Italy, (2) Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Catania, Italy)
Abstract: Audio deepfakes represent a growing threat to digital security and trust, leveraging advanced generative models to produce synthetic speech that closely mimics real human voices. Detecting such manipulations is especially challenging under open-world conditions, where spoofing methods encountered during testing may differ from those seen during training. In this work, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework for audio deepfake detection that operates directly on raw waveforms. Our model, RawNetLite, is a lightweight convolutional-recurrent architecture designed to capture both spectral and temporal features without handcrafted preprocessing. To enhance robustness, we introduce a training strategy that combines data from multiple domains and adopts Focal Loss to emphasize difficult or ambiguous samples. We further demonstrate that incorporating codec-based manipulations and applying waveform-level audio augmentations (e.g., pitch shifting, noise, and time stretching) leads to significant generalization improvements under realistic acoustic conditions. The proposed model achieves over 99.7% F1 and 0.25% EER on in-domain data (FakeOrReal), and up to 83.4% F1 with 16.4% EER on a challenging out-of-distribution test set (AVSpoof2021 + CodecFake). These findings highlight the importance of diverse training data, tailored objective functions and audio augmentations in building resilient and generalizable audio forgery detectors.

Title: Flexible Semantic-Aware Resource Allocation: Serving More Users Through Similarity Range Constraints
Authors: Nasrin Gholami, Neda Moghim, Behrouz Shahgholi Ghahfarokhi, Pouyan Salavati, Christo Kurisummoottil Thomas, Sachin Shetty, Tahereh Rahmati
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) aims to enhance the resource efficiency of next-generation networks by transmitting the underlying meaning of messages, focusing on information relevant to the end user. Existing literature on SemCom primarily emphasizes learning the encoder and decoder through end-to-end deep learning frameworks, with the objective of minimizing a task-specific semantic loss function. Beyond its influence on the physical and application layer design, semantic variability across users in multi-user systems enables the design of resource allocation schemes that incorporate user-specific semantic requirements. To this end, \emph{a semantic-aware resource allocation} scheme is proposed with the objective of maximizing transmission and semantic reliability, ultimately increasing the number of users whose semantic requirements are met. The resulting resource allocation problem is a non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is known to be NP-hard. To make the problem tractable, it is decomposed into a set of sub-problems, each of which is efficiently solved via geometric programming techniques. Finally, simulations demonstrate that the proposed method improves user satisfaction by up to $17.1\%$ compared to state of the art methods based on quality of experience-aware SemCom methods.

Title: Deep Learning Characterizes Depression and Suicidal Ideation from Eye Movements
Authors: Kleanthis Avramidis, Woojae Jeong, Aditya Kommineni, Sudarsana R. Kadiri, Marcus Ma, Colin McDaniel, Myzelle Hughes, Thomas McGee, Elsi Kaiser, Dani Byrd, Assal Habibi, B. Rael Cahn, Idan A. Blank, Kristina Lerman, Takfarinas Medani, Richard M. Leahy, Shrikanth Narayanan
Abstract: Identifying physiological and behavioral markers for mental health conditions is a longstanding challenge in psychiatry. Depression and suicidal ideation, in particular, lack objective biomarkers, with screening and diagnosis primarily relying on self-reports and clinical interviews. Here, we investigate eye tracking as a potential marker modality for screening purposes. Eye movements are directly modulated by neuronal networks and have been associated with attentional and mood-related patterns; however, their predictive value for depression and suicidality remains unclear. We recorded eye-tracking sequences from 126 young adults as they read and responded to affective sentences, and subsequently developed a deep learning framework to predict their clinical status. The proposed model included separate branches for trials of positive and negative sentiment, and used 2D time-series representations to account for both intra-trial and inter-trial variations. We were able to identify depression and suicidal ideation with an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.793 (95% CI: 0.765-0.819) against healthy controls, and suicidality specifically with 0.826 AUC (95% CI: 0.797-0.852). The model also exhibited moderate, yet significant, accuracy in differentiating depressed from suicidal participants, with 0.609 AUC (95% CI 0.571-0.646). Discriminative patterns emerge more strongly when assessing the data relative to response generation than relative to the onset time of the final word of the sentences. The most pronounced effects were observed for negative-sentiment sentences, that are congruent to depressed and suicidal participants. Our findings highlight eye tracking as an objective tool for mental health assessment and underscore the modulatory impact of emotional stimuli on cognitive processes affecting oculomotor control.

Title: Ring deconvolution microscopy: exploiting symmetry for efficient spatially varying aberration correction
Authors: Amit Kohli, Anastasios N. Angelopoulos, David McAllister, Esther Whang, Sixian You, Kyrollos Yanny, Federico M. Gasparoli, Bo-Jui Chang, Reto Fiolka, Laura Waller
Abstract: The most ubiquitous form of computational aberration correction for microscopy is deconvolution. However, deconvolution relies on the assumption that the point spread function is the same across the entire field-of-view. This assumption is often inadequate, but space-variant deblurring techniques generally require impractical amounts of calibration and computation. We present a new imaging pipeline that leverages symmetry to provide simple and fast spatially-varying aberration correction. Our ring deconvolution microscopy (RDM) method leverages the rotational symmetry of most microscopes and cameras, and naturally extends to sheet deconvolution in the case of lateral symmetry. We formally derive theory and algorithms for image recovery and additionally propose a neural network based on Seidel coefficients as a fast alternative, as well as extension of RDM to blind deconvolution. We demonstrate significant improvements in speed and image quality as compared to standard deconvolution and existing spatially-varying deconvolution across a diverse range of microscope modalities, including miniature microscopy, multicolor fluorescence microscopy, point-scanning multimode fiber micro-endoscopy, and light-sheet fluorescence microscopy. Our approach enables near-isotropic, subcellular resolution in each of these applications.

Title: Offline and Online Use of Interval and Set-Based Approaches for Control and State Estimation: A Selection of Methodological Approaches and Their Application
Authors: Andreas Rauh, Marit Lahme, Simon Rohou, Luc Jaulin, Thach Ngoc Dinh, Tarek Raissi, Mohamed Fnadi
Abstract: Control and state estimation procedures need to be robust against imprecisely known parameters, uncertainty in initial conditions, and external disturbances. Interval methods and other set-based techniques form the basis for the implementation of powerful approaches that can be used to identify parameters of dynamic system models in the presence of the aforementioned types of uncertainty. Moreover, they are applicable to a verified feasibility and stability analysis of controllers and state estimators. In addition to these approaches which are typically used offline for analysis of system models designed with classical floating point procedures, interval and set-based methods have also been developed in recent years, which allow to directly solve the associated design tasks and to implement reliable techniques that are applicable online, i.e., during system operation. The latter approaches include set-based model predictive control, online parameter adaptation techniques for nonlinear variable-structure and backstepping controllers, interval observers, and fault diagnosis techniques. This paper provides an overview of the methodological background and reviews numerous practical applications for which interval and other set-valued approaches have been employed successfully.

Title: Phase retrieval with semi-algebraic and ReLU neural network priors
Authors: Tamir Bendory, Nadav Dym, Dan Edidin, Arun Suresh
Abstract: The key ingredient to retrieving a signal from its Fourier magnitudes, namely, to solve the phase retrieval problem, is an effective prior on the sought signal. In this paper, we study the phase retrieval problem under the prior that the signal lies in a semi-algebraic set. This is a very general prior as semi-algebraic sets include linear models, sparse models, and ReLU neural network generative models. The latter is the main motivation of this paper, due to the remarkable success of deep generative models in a variety of imaging tasks, including phase retrieval. We prove that almost all signals in R^N can be determined from their Fourier magnitudes, up to a sign, if they lie in a (generic) semi-algebraic set of dimension N/2. The same is true for all signals if the semi-algebraic set is of dimension N/4. We also generalize these results to the problem of signal recovery from the second moment in multi-reference alignment models with multiplicity free representations of compact groups. This general result is then used to derive improved sample complexity bounds for recovering band-limited functions on the sphere from their noisy copies, each acted upon by a random element of SO(3).

Title: Trading off regional and overall energy system design flexibility in the net-zero transition
Authors: Koen van Greevenbroek, Aleksander Grochowicz, Marianne Zeyringer, Fred Espen Benth
Abstract: The transition to net-zero emissions in Europe is determined by a patchwork of country-level and EU-wide policy, creating coordination challenges in an interconnected system. We use an optimisation model to map out near-optimal energy system designs for 2050, focussing on the planning flexibility of individual regions while maintaining overall system robustness against different weather years, cost assumptions, and land use limitations. Our results reveal extensive flexibility at a regional level, where only few technologies (solar around the Adriatic and wind on the British Isles and in Germany) cannot be substituted. National policymakers can influence renewable energy export and hydrogen strategies significantly, provided they coordinate this with the remaining European system. However, stronger commitment to solar in Southern Europe and Germany unlocks more design options for Europe overall. These results on regional trade-offs facilitate more meaningful policy discussions which are crucial in the transition to a sustainable energy system.

Title: Input-Output Extension of Underactuated Nonlinear Systems
Authors: Mirko Mizzoni, Amr Afifi, Antonio Franchi
Abstract: This letter addresses the challenge of enhancing the task-space capabilities of commercial underactuated systems through the integration of auxiliary actuators, while preserving their internal control architecture. We propose a method where additional actuators are combined with a feedback-linearizing outer loop controller, enabling full-pose tracking without modifying the platform's certified low-level controller. The key contribution is a theoretical framework establishing conditions under which legacy high-level commands and new actuator inputs can be cohesively coordinated to achieve decoupled control of all degrees of freedom. These conditions are validated through numerical simulations on a quadrotor retrofitted with two additional propellers. The results demonstrate stable 6D trajectory tracking, highlighting the method's ability to reconcile enhanced dexterity with industrial constraints such as certification and safety.

Title: On the Scientific Method: The Role of Hypotheses and Involved Mathematics
Authors: Mario Milanese, Carlo Novara, Michele Taragna
Abstract: The paper investigates the role of data, hypotheses and mathematical methods that can be used in the discovery of a law y=fo(u), relating variables u and y of a physical phenomenon, making use of experimental measurements of such variables. Since the exact knowledge of the function fo cannot be expected, the problem of deriving approximate functions giving a small approximation error, measured by some function norm, is discussed. The main contributions of the paper are summarized as follows. At first, it is proven that deriving a reliable approximation, i.e., having a finite error, is not possible using measured data only. Thus, for deriving a reliable approximation, hypotheses on the function fo and on the disturbances corrupting the measurements must be introduced. Second, necessary and sufficient conditions for deriving a reliable approximation are provided. If such conditions are satisfied, suitable accuracy properties of the approximation can be defined, called theoretical properties. Third, it is shown that it is not possible to verify the conditions necessary for deriving a reliable approximation, but it is possible to verify that hypotheses on fo and on the disturbances are falsified by experimental measurements, showing that no function and disturbances satisfying the given hypotheses exist, able to reproduce the measurements (this is called falsification property). The above properties are then discussed for hypotheses belonging to the following classes: Parametric Probabilistic, where fo is assumed to be a function depending on a vector p and the disturbances are assumed to be stochastic variables; Set Membership class, where fo is assumed to be a bounded smooth function and the disturbances are assumed to be bounded variables; Parametric Set Membership class, able to integrate Parametric Probabilistic hypotheses with Set Membership hypotheses.

Title: Design and Analysis of Binaural Signal Matching with Arbitrary Microphone Arrays and Listener Head Rotations
Authors: Lior Madmoni, Zamir Ben-Hur, Jacob Donley, Vladimir Tourbabin, Boaz Rafaely
Abstract: Binaural reproduction is rapidly becoming a topic of great interest in the research community, especially with the surge of new and popular devices, such as virtual reality headsets, smart glasses, and head-tracked headphones. In order to immerse the listener in a virtual or remote environment with such devices, it is essential to generate realistic and accurate binaural signals. This is challenging, especially since the microphone arrays mounted on these devices are typically composed of an arbitrarily-arranged small number of microphones, which impedes the use of standard audio formats like Ambisonics, and provides limited spatial resolution. The binaural signal matching (BSM) method was developed recently to overcome these challenges. While it produced binaural signals with low error using relatively simple arrays, its performance degraded significantly when head rotation was introduced. This paper aims to develop the BSM method further and overcome its limitations. For this purpose, the method is first analyzed in detail, and a design framework that guarantees accurate binaural reproduction for relatively complex acoustic environments is presented. Next, it is shown that the BSM accuracy may significantly degrade at high frequencies, and thus, a perceptually motivated extension to the method is proposed, based on a magnitude least-squares (MagLS) formulation. These insights and developments are then analyzed with the help of an extensive simulation study of a simple six-microphone semi-circular array. It is further shown that the BSM-MagLS method can be very useful in compensating for head rotations with this array. Finally, a listening experiment is conducted with a four-microphone array on a pair of glasses in a reverberant speech environment and including head rotations, where it is shown that BSM-MagLS can indeed produce binaural signals with a high perceived quality.

Title: A Deep Generative Model for Five-Class Sleep Staging with Arbitrary Sensor Input
Authors: Hans van Gorp, Merel M. van Gilst, Pedro Fonseca, Fokke B. van Meulen, Johannes P. van Dijk, Sebastiaan Overeem, Ruud J. G. van Sloun
Abstract: Gold-standard sleep scoring is based on epoch-based assignment of sleep stages based on a combination of EEG, EOG and EMG signals. However, a polysomnographic recording consists of many other signals that could be used for sleep staging, including cardio-respiratory modalities. Leveraging this signal variety would offer important advantages, for example increasing reliability, resilience to signal loss, and application to long-term non-obtrusive recordings. We developed a deep generative model for automatic sleep staging from a plurality of sensors and any -arbitrary- combination thereof. We trained a score-based diffusion model using a dataset of 1947 expert-labelled overnight recordings with 36 different signals, and achieved zero-shot inference on any sensor set by leveraging a novel Bayesian factorization of the score function across the sensors. On single-channel EEG, the model reaches the performance limit in terms of polysomnography inter-rater agreement (5- class accuracy 85.6%, Cohen's kappa 0.791). Moreover, the method offers full flexibility to use any sensor set, for example finger photoplethysmography, nasal flow and thoracic respiratory movements, (5-class accuracy 79.0%, Cohen's kappa of 0.697), or even derivations very unconventional for sleep staging, such as tibialis and sternocleidomastoid EMG (5-class accuracy 71.0%, kappa 0.575). Additionally, we propose a novel interpretability metric in terms of information gain per sensor and show this is linearly correlated with classification performance. Finally, our model allows for post- hoc addition of entirely new sensor modalities by merely training a score estimator on the novel input instead of having to retrain from scratch on all inputs.

Title: Anomaly Detection in Time Series of EDFA Pump Currents to Monitor Degeneration Processes using Fuzzy Clustering
Authors: Dominic Schneider, Lutz Rapp, Christoph Ament
Abstract: This article proposes a novel fuzzy clustering based anomaly detection method for pump current time series of EDFA systems. The proposed change detection framework (CDF) strategically combines the advantages of entropy analysis (EA) and principle component analysis (PCA) with fuzzy clustering procedures. In the framework, EA is applied for dynamic selection of features for reduction of the feature space and increase of computational performance. Furthermore, PCA is utilized to extract features from the raw feature space to enable generalization capability of the subsequent fuzzy clustering procedures. Three different fuzzy clustering methods, more precisely the fuzzy clustering algorithm, a probabilistic clustering algorithm and a possibilistic clustering algorithm are evaluated for performance and generalization. Hence, the proposed framework has the innovative feature to detect changes in pump current time series at an early stage for arbitrary points of operation, compared to state-of-the-art predefined alarms in commercially used EDFAs. Moreover, the approach is implemented and tested using experimental data. In addition, the proposed framework enables further approaches of applying decentralized predictive maintenance for optical fiber networks.

Title: A New 8/14 Two-Phase Switched Reluctance Motor
Authors: Gholamreza Davarpanah, Hossein Shirzad, Jawad Faiz
Abstract: Despite their simple and robust structure, low cost, and simple cooling system, switched reluctance motors (SRMs) face the challenge of low mean torque. A possible solution is to change the structure of SRMs. This article introduces an innovative combination of the number of rotor teeth and stator teeth of a two-phase switch reluctance motor (TPSRM) with eight teeth for the stator and fourteen teeth for the rotor. As a result of its unique design, which has a short path for passing the main flux, it requires less magnetomotive force. This leads to less core and copper loss, resulting in increased efficiency. Each tooth of the stator in a phase develops a positive torque during the rotation of the rotor, which increases the torque and consequently increases the mean torque of the proposed TPSRM. A current hysteresis control (CHC) is simulated by 2D FEM for the proposed 8/14 TPSRM and the conventional 8/12 TPSRM under the same mechanical load on the shaft to get a current hysteresis reference of 15A at the nominal speed of 600 rpm. To verify the novelty and advantages of the suggested TPSRM, it is compared with the conventional 8/12 TPSRM in terms of mean and peak torque, torque density, and core and copper losses were compared. Lastly, the proposed 8/14 TPSRM is shown to have better performance than the conventional 8/12 TPSRM.

Title: SE(3)-Based Trajectory Optimization and Target Tracking in UAV-Enabled ISAC Systems
Authors: Dongxiao Xu, Xinyang Li, Vlad C. Andrei, Moritz Wiese, Ullrich J. Moenich, Holger Boche
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to enhance sensing capabilities in UAV-enabled MIMO-OFDM ISAC systems by leveraging UAV mobility as a mono-static radar. By integrating uniform planar arrays (UPAs) and modeling the UAV dynamics in $SE(3)$, we address key challenges such as 3D space sensing and trajectory design. We propose a target tracking scheme using extended Kalman filtering (EKF) in $SE(3)$, along with trajectory optimization based on the conditional Posterior Cramer-Rao bound (CPCRB). Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory design in enhancing performance of target tracking and physical parameter estimation in UAV-enabled MIMO-OFDM ISAC systems.

Title: Machine Learning Based Probe Skew Correction for High-frequency BH Loop Measurements
Authors: Yakun Wang, Song Liu, Jun Wang, Binyu Cui, Jingrong Yang
Abstract: Experimental characterization of magnetic components has grown to be increasingly important to understand and model their behaviours in high-frequency PWM converters. The BH loop measurement is the only available approach to separate the core loss as an electrical method, which, however, is susceptive to the probe phase skew. As an alternative to the regular de-skew approaches based on hardware, this work proposes a novel machine-learning-based method to identify and correct the probe skew, which builds on the newly discovered correlation between the skew and the shape/trajectory of the measured BH loop. A special technique is proposed to artificially generate skewed images from measured waveforms as augmented training sets. A machine learning pipeline is developed with the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to treat the problem as an image-based prediction task. The trained model has demonstrated a high accuracy and generalizability in identifying the skew value from a BH loop unseen by the model, which enables the compensation of the skew to yield the corrected core loss value and BH loop.

Title: Adaptive Progressive Attention Graph Neural Network for EEG Emotion Recognition
Authors: Tianzhi Feng, Chennan Wu, Yi Niu, Fu Li, Yang Li, Boxun Fu, Zhifu Zhao, Xiaotian Wang
Abstract: In recent years, numerous neuroscientific studies demonstrate that specific areas of the brain are connected to human emotional responses, with these regions exhibiting variability across individuals and emotional states. To fully leverage these neural patterns, we propose an Adaptive Progressive Attention Graph Neural Network (APAGNN), which dynamically captures the spatial relationships among brain regions during emotional processing. The APAGNN employs three specialized experts that progressively analyze brain topology. The first expert captures global brain patterns, the second focuses on region-specific features, and the third examines emotion-related channels. This hierarchical approach enables increasingly refined analysis of neural activity. Additionally, a weight generator integrates the outputs of all three experts, balancing their contributions to produce the final predictive label. Extensive experiments conducted on SEED, SEED-IV and MPED datasets indicate that our method enhances EEG emotion recognition performance, achieving superior results compared to baseline methods.

We introduce 3D ReX, the first causality-based post-hoc explainability tool for 3D models. 3D ReX uses the theory of actual causality to generate responsibility maps which highlight the regions most crucial to the model's decision. We test 3D ReX on a stroke detection model, providing insight into the spatial distribution of features relevant to stroke.

Title: RGB-Thermal Infrared Fusion for Robust Depth Estimation in Complex Environments
Authors: Zelin Meng, Takanori Fukao
Abstract: Depth estimation in complex real-world scenarios is a challenging task, especially when relying solely on a single modality such as visible light or thermal infrared (THR) imagery. This paper proposes a novel multimodal depth estimation model, RTFusion, which enhances depth estimation accuracy and robustness by integrating the complementary strengths of RGB and THR data. The RGB modality provides rich texture and color information, while the THR modality captures thermal patterns, ensuring stability under adverse lighting conditions such as extreme illumination. The model incorporates a unique fusion mechanism, EGFusion, consisting of the Mutual Complementary Attention (MCA) module for cross-modal feature alignment and the Edge Saliency Enhancement Module (ESEM) to improve edge detail preservation. Comprehensive experiments on the MS2 and ViViD++ datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently produces high-quality depth maps across various challenging environments, including nighttime, rainy, and high-glare conditions. The experimental results highlight the potential of the proposed method in applications requiring reliable depth estimation, such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality.

Title: Mitigating Timbre Leakage with Universal Semantic Mapping Residual Block for Voice Conversion
Authors: Na Li, Chuke Wang, Yu Gu, Zhifeng Li
Abstract: Voice conversion (VC) transforms source speech into a target voice by preserving the content. However, timbre information from the source speaker is inherently embedded in the content representations, causing significant timbre leakage and reducing similarity to the target speaker. To address this, we introduce a residual block to a content extractor. The residual block consists of two weighted branches: 1) universal semantic dictionary based Content Feature Re-expression (CFR) module, supplying timbre-free content representation. 2) skip connection to the original content layer, providing complementary fine-grained information. In the CFR module, each dictionary entry in the universal semantic dictionary represents a phoneme class, computed statistically using speech from multiple speakers, creating a stable, speaker-independent semantic set. We introduce a CFR method to obtain timbre-free content representations by expressing each content frame as a weighted linear combination of dictionary entries using corresponding phoneme posteriors as weights. Extensive experiments across various VC frameworks demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates timbre leakage and significantly improves similarity to the target speaker.

Title: Adaptive Weight Modified Riesz Mean Filter For High-Density Salt and Pepper Noise Removal
Authors: Md Jahidul Islam
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel filter, the Adaptive Weight Modified Riesz Mean Filter (AWMRmF), designed for the effective removal of high-density salt and pepper noise (SPN). AWMRmF integrates a pixel weight function and adaptivity condition inspired by the Different Adaptive Modified Riesz Mean Filter (DAMRmF). In my simulations, I evaluated the performance of AWMRmF against established filters such as Adaptive Frequency Median Filter (AFMF), Adaptive Weighted Mean Filter (AWMF), Adaptive Cesaro Mean Filter (ACmF), Adaptive Riesz Mean Filter (ARmF), and Improved Adaptive Weighted Mean Filter (IAWMF). The assessment was conducted on 26 typical test images, varying noise levels from 60% to 95%. The findings indicate that, in terms of both Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity (SSIM) metrics, AWMRmF outperformed other state-of-the-art filters. Furthermore, AWMRmF demonstrated superior performance in mean PSNR and SSIM results as well.

Title: Versatile Framework for Song Generation with Prompt-based Control
Authors: Yu Zhang, Wenxiang Guo, Changhao Pan, Zhiyuan Zhu, Ruiqi Li, Jingyu Lu, Rongjie Huang, Ruiyuan Zhang, Zhiqing Hong, Ziyue Jiang, Zhou Zhao
Abstract: Song generation focuses on producing controllable high-quality songs based on various prompts. However, existing methods struggle to generate vocals and accompaniments with prompt-based control and proper alignment. Additionally, they fall short in supporting various tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce VersBand, a multi-task song generation framework for synthesizing high-quality, aligned songs with prompt-based control. VersBand comprises these primary models: 1) VocalBand, a decoupled model, leverages the flow-matching method for generating singing styles, pitches, and mel-spectrograms, allowing fast, high-quality vocal generation with style control. 2) AccompBand, a flow-based transformer model, incorporates the Band-MOE, selecting suitable experts for enhanced quality, alignment, and control. This model allows for generating controllable, high-quality accompaniments aligned with vocals. 3) Two generation models, LyricBand for lyrics and MelodyBand for melodies, contribute to the comprehensive multi-task song generation system, allowing for extensive control based on multiple prompts. Experimental results demonstrate that VersBand performs better over baseline models across multiple song generation tasks using objective and subjective metrics.

Title: Improving Generalization in MRI-Based Deep Learning Models for Total Knee Replacement Prediction
Authors: Ehsan Karami, Hamid Soltanian-Zadeh
Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common joint disease that causes pain and mobility issues. While MRI-based deep learning models have demonstrated superior performance in predicting total knee replacement (TKR) and disease progression, their generalizability remains challenging, particularly when applied to imaging data from different sources. In this study, we have shown that replacing batch normalization with instance normalization, using data augmentation, and applying contrastive loss improves model generalization in a baseline deep learning model for knee osteoarthritis (KOA) prediction. We trained and evaluated our model using MRI data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) database, considering sagittal fat-suppressed intermediate-weighted turbo spin-echo (FS-IW-TSE) images as the source domain and sagittal fat-suppressed three-dimensional (3D) dual-echo in steady state (DESS) images as the target domain. The results demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in classification accuracy across both domains, with our approach outperforming the baseline model.

Title: The Adaptive $τ$-Lasso: Robustness and Oracle Properties
Authors: Emadaldin Mozafari-Majd, Visa Koivunen
Abstract: This paper introduces a new regularized version of the robust $\tau$-regression estimator for analyzing high-dimensional datasets subject to gross contamination in the response variables and covariates. The resulting estimator, termed adaptive $\tau$-Lasso, is robust to outliers and high-leverage points. It also incorporates an adaptive $\ell_1$-norm penalty term, which enables the selection of relevant variables and reduces the bias associated with large true regression coefficients. More specifically, this adaptive $\ell_1$-norm penalty term assigns a weight to each regression coefficient. For a fixed number of predictors $p$, we show that the adaptive $\tau$-Lasso has the oracle property, ensuring both variable-selection consistency and asymptotic normality. Asymptotic normality applies only to the entries of the regression vector corresponding to the true support, assuming knowledge of the true regression vector support. We characterize its robustness by establishing the finite-sample breakdown point and the influence function. We carry out extensive simulations and observe that the class of $\tau$-Lasso estimators exhibits robustness and reliable performance in both contaminated and uncontaminated data settings. We also validate our theoretical findings on robustness properties through simulations. In the face of outliers and high-leverage points, the adaptive $\tau$-Lasso and $\tau$-Lasso estimators achieve the best performance or match the best performances of competing regularized estimators, with minimal or no loss in terms of prediction and variable selection accuracy for almost all scenarios considered in this study. Therefore, the adaptive $\tau$-Lasso and $\tau$-Lasso estimators provide attractive tools for a variety of sparse linear regression problems, particularly in high-dimensional settings and when the data is contaminated by outliers and high-leverage points.

Title: QA-MDT: Quality-aware Masked Diffusion Transformer for Enhanced Music Generation
Authors: Chang Li, Ruoyu Wang, Lijuan Liu, Jun Du, Yixuan Sun, Zilu Guo, Zhenrong Zhang, Yuan Jiang, Jianqing Gao, Feng Ma
Abstract: Text-to-music (TTM) generation, which converts textual descriptions into audio, opens up innovative avenues for multimedia creation. Achieving high quality and diversity in this process demands extensive, high-quality data, which are often scarce in available datasets. Most open-source datasets frequently suffer from issues like low-quality waveforms and low text-audio consistency, hindering the advancement of music generation models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel quality-aware training paradigm for generating high-quality, high-musicality music from large-scale, quality-imbalanced datasets. Additionally, by leveraging unique properties in the latent space of musical signals, we adapt and implement a masked diffusion transformer (MDT) model for the TTM task, showcasing its capacity for quality control and enhanced musicality. Furthermore, we introduce a three-stage caption refinement approach to address low-quality captions' issue. Experiments show state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on benchmark datasets including MusicCaps and the Song-Describer Dataset with both objective and subjective metrics. Demo audio samples are available at this https URL, code and pretrained checkpoints are open-sourced at this https URL.

Title: Scalable Surrogate Verification of Image-based Neural Network Control Systems using Composition and Unrolling
Authors: Feiyang Cai, Chuchu Fan, Stanley Bak
Abstract: Verifying safety of neural network control systems that use images as input is a difficult problem because, from a given system state, there is no known way to mathematically model what images are possible in the real-world. We build on recent work that considers a surrogate verification approach, training a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) as an image generator in place of the real world. This enables set-based formal analysis of the closed-loop system, providing analysis beyond simulation and testing. While existing work is effective on small examples, excessive overapproximation both within a single control period and across multiple control periods limits its scalability. We propose approaches to overcome these two sources of error. First, we overcome one-step error by composing the system's dynamics along with the cGAN and neural network controller, without losing the dependencies between input states and the control outputs as in the monotonic analysis of the system dynamics. Second, we reduce multi-step error by repeating the single-step composition, essentially unrolling multiple steps of the control loop into a large neural network. We then leverage existing network verification tools to compute accurate reachable sets for multiple steps, avoiding the accumulation of abstraction error at each step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of both accuracy and scalability using two case studies: an autonomous aircraft taxiing system and an advanced emergency braking system. On the aircraft taxiing system, the converged reachable set is 175% larger using the prior baseline method compared with our proposed approach. On the emergency braking system, with 24x the number of image output variables from the cGAN, the baseline method fails to prove any states are safe, whereas our improvements enable set-based safety analysis.

Title: Courteous MPC for Autonomous Driving with CBF-inspired Risk Assessment
Authors: Yanze Zhang, Yiwei Lyu, Sude E. Demir, Xingyu Zhou, Yupeng Yang, Junmin Wang, Wenhao Luo
Abstract: With more autonomous vehicles (AVs) sharing roadways with human-driven vehicles (HVs), ensuring safe and courteous maneuvers that respect HVs' behavior becomes increasingly important. To promote both safety and courtesy in AV's behavior, an extension of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs)-inspired risk evaluation framework is proposed in this paper by considering both noisy observed positions and velocities of surrounding vehicles. The perceived risk by the ego vehicle can be visualized as a risk map that reflects the understanding of the surrounding environment and thus shows the potential for facilitating safe and courteous driving. By incorporating the risk evaluation framework into the Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme, we propose a Courteous MPC for ego AV to generate courteous behaviors that 1) reduce the overall risk imposed on other vehicles and 2) respect the hard safety constraints and the original objective for efficiency. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed Courteous MPC via theoretical analysis and simulation experiments.

Title: Hook-Based Aerial Payload Grasping from a Moving Platform
Authors: Péter Antal, Tamás Péni, Roland Tóth
Abstract: This paper investigates payload grasping from a moving platform using a hook-equipped aerial manipulator. First, a computationally efficient trajectory optimization based on complementarity constraints is proposed to determine the optimal grasping time. To enable application in complex, dynamically changing environments, the future motion of the payload is predicted using a physics simulator-based model. The success of payload grasping under model uncertainties and external disturbances is formally verified through a robustness analysis method based on integral quadratic constraints. The proposed algorithms are evaluated in a high-fidelity physical simulator, and in real flight experiments using a custom-designed aerial manipulator platform.

Title: Foundations of Safe Online Reinforcement Learning in the Linear Quadratic Regulator: Generalized Baselines
Authors: Benjamin Schiffer, Lucas Janson
Abstract: Many practical applications of online reinforcement learning require the satisfaction of safety constraints while learning about the unknown environment. In this work, we establish theoretical foundations for reinforcement learning with safety constraints by studying the canonical problem of Linear Quadratic Regulator learning with unknown dynamics, but with the additional constraint that the position must stay within a safe region for the entire trajectory with high probability. Our primary contribution is a general framework for studying stronger baselines of nonlinear controllers that are better suited for constrained problems than linear controllers. Due to the difficulty of analyzing non-linear controllers in a constrained problem, we focus on 1-dimensional state- and action- spaces, however we also discuss how we expect the high-level takeaways can generalize to higher dimensions. Using our framework, we show that for \emph{any} non-linear baseline satisfying natural assumptions, $\tilde{O}_T(\sqrt{T})$-regret is possible when the noise distribution has sufficiently large support, and $\tilde{O}_T(T^{2/3})$-regret is possible for \emph{any} subgaussian noise distribution. In proving these results, we introduce a new uncertainty estimation bound for nonlinear controls which shows that enforcing safety in the presence of sufficient noise can provide ``free exploration'' that compensates for the added cost of uncertainty in safety-constrained control.

Title: Adaptive Neural Unscented Kalman Filter
Authors: Amit Levy, Itzik Klein
Abstract: The unscented Kalman filter is an algorithm capable of handling nonlinear scenarios. Uncertainty in process noise covariance may decrease the filter estimation performance or even lead to its divergence. Therefore, it is important to adjust the process noise covariance matrix in real time. In this paper, we developed an adaptive neural unscented Kalman filter to cope with time-varying uncertainties during platform operation. To this end, we devised ProcessNet, a simple yet efficient end-to-end regression network to adaptively estimate the process noise covariance matrix. We focused on the nonlinear inertial sensor and Doppler velocity log fusion problem in the case of autonomous underwater vehicle navigation. Using a real-world recorded dataset from an autonomous underwater vehicle, we demonstrated our filter performance and showed its advantages over other adaptive and non-adaptive nonlinear filters.

Title: Model Predictive Control with Visibility Graphs for Humanoid Path Planning and Tracking Against Adversarial Opponents
Authors: Ruochen Hou, Gabriel I. Fernandez, Mingzhang Zhu, Dennis W. Hong
Abstract: In this paper we detail the methods used for obstacle avoidance, path planning, and trajectory tracking that helped us win the adult-sized, autonomous humanoid soccer league in RoboCup 2024. Our team was undefeated for all seated matches and scored 45 goals over 6 games, winning the championship game 6 to 1. During the competition, a major challenge for collision avoidance was the measurement noise coming from bipedal locomotion and a limited field of view (FOV). Furthermore, obstacles would sporadically jump in and out of our planned trajectory. At times our estimator would place our robot inside a hard constraint. Any planner in this competition must also be be computationally efficient enough to re-plan and react in real time. This motivated our approach to trajectory generation and tracking. In many scenarios long-term and short-term planning is needed. To efficiently find a long-term general path that avoids all obstacles we developed DAVG (Dynamic Augmented Visibility Graphs). DAVG focuses on essential path planning by setting certain regions to be active based on obstacles and the desired goal pose. By augmenting the states in the graph, turning angles are considered, which is crucial for a large soccer playing robot as turning may be more costly. A trajectory is formed by linearly interpolating between discrete points generated by DAVG. A modified version of model predictive control (MPC) is used to then track this trajectory called cf-MPC (Collision-Free MPC). This ensures short-term planning. Without having to switch formulations cf-MPC takes into account the robot dynamics and collision free constraints. Without a hard switch the control input can smoothly transition in cases where the noise places our robot inside a constraint boundary. The nonlinear formulation runs at approximately 120 Hz, while the quadratic version achieves around 400 Hz.

Title: Imperative MPC: An End-to-End Self-Supervised Learning with Differentiable MPC for UAV Attitude Control
Authors: Haonan He, Yuheng Qiu, Junyi Geng
Abstract: Modeling and control of nonlinear dynamics are critical in robotics, especially in scenarios with unpredictable external influences and complex dynamics. Traditional cascaded modular control pipelines often yield suboptimal performance due to conservative assumptions and tedious parameter tuning. Pure data-driven approaches promise robust performance but suffer from low sample efficiency, sim-to-real gaps, and reliance on extensive datasets. Hybrid methods combining learning-based and traditional model-based control in an end-to-end manner offer a promising alternative. This work presents a self-supervised learning framework combining learning-based inertial odometry (IO) module and differentiable model predictive control (d-MPC) for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) attitude control. The IO denoises raw IMU measurements and predicts UAV attitudes, which are then optimized by MPC for control actions in a bi-level optimization (BLO) setup, where the inner MPC optimizes control actions and the upper level minimizes discrepancy between real-world and predicted performance. The framework is thus end-to-end and can be trained in a self-supervised manner. This approach combines the strength of learning-based perception with the interpretable model-based control. Results show the effectiveness even under strong wind. It can simultaneously enhance both the MPC parameter learning and IMU prediction performance.

Title: Speaker Retrieval in the Wild: Challenges, Effectiveness and Robustness
Authors: Erfan Loweimi, Mengjie Qian, Kate Knill, Mark Gales
Abstract: There is a growing abundance of publicly available or company-owned audio/video archives, highlighting the increasing importance of efficient access to desired content and information retrieval from these archives. This paper investigates the challenges, solutions, effectiveness, and robustness of speaker retrieval systems developed "in the wild" which involves addressing two primary challenges: extraction of task-relevant labels from limited metadata for system development and evaluation, as well as the unconstrained acoustic conditions encountered in the archive, ranging from quiet studios to adverse noisy environments. While we focus on the publicly-available BBC Rewind archive (spanning 1948 to 1979), our framework addresses the broader issue of speaker retrieval on extensive and possibly aged archives with no control over the content and acoustic conditions. Typically, these archives offer a brief and general file description, mostly inadequate for specific applications like speaker retrieval, and manual annotation of such large-scale archives is unfeasible. We explore various aspects of system development (e.g., speaker diarisation, embedding extraction, query selection) and analyse the challenges, possible solutions, and their functionality. To evaluate the performance, we conduct systematic experiments in both clean setup and against various distortions simulating real-world applications. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the developed speaker retrieval systems, establishing the versatility and scalability of the proposed framework for a wide range of applications beyond the BBC Rewind corpus.

Title: Synthesis of Discrete-time Control Barrier Functions for Polynomial Systems Based on Sum-of-Squares Programming
Authors: Erfan Shakhesi, W.P.M.H. Heemels, Alexander Katriniok
Abstract: Discrete-time Control Barrier Functions (DTCBFs) are commonly utilized in the literature as a powerful tool for synthesizing control policies that guarantee safety of discrete-time dynamical systems. However, the systematic synthesis of DTCBFs in a computationally efficient way is at present an important open problem. This article first proposes a novel alternating-descent approach based on Sum-of-Squares programming to synthesize quadratic DTCBFs and corresponding polynomial control policies for discrete-time control-affine polynomial systems with input constraints and semi-algebraic safe sets. Subsequently, two distinct approaches are introduced to extend the proposed method to the synthesis of higher-degree polynomial DTCBFs. To demonstrate its efficacy, we apply the proposed method to numerical case studies.

Title: Feelbert: A Feedback Linearization-based Embedded Real-Time Quadrupedal Locomotion Framework
Authors: Aristide Emanuele Casucci, Federico Nesti, Mauro Marinoni, Giorgio Buttazzo
Abstract: Quadruped robots have become quite popular for their ability to adapt their locomotion to generic uneven terrains. For this reason, over time, several frameworks for quadrupedal locomotion have been proposed, but with little attention to ensuring a predictable timing behavior of the controller. To address this issue, this work presents Feelbert, a modular control framework for quadrupedal locomotion suitable for execution on an embedded system under hard real-time execution constraints. It leverages the feedback linearization control technique to obtain a closed-form control law for the body, valid for all configurations of the robot. The control law was derived after defining an appropriate rigid body model that uses the accelerations of the feet as control variables, instead of the estimated contact forces. This work also provides a novel algorithm to compute footholds and gait temporal parameters using the concept of imaginary wheels, and a heuristic algorithm to select the best gait schedule for the current velocity commands. The proposed framework is developed entirely in C++, with no dependencies on third-party libraries and no dynamic memory allocation, to ensure predictability and real-time performance. Its implementation allows Feelbert to be both compiled and executed on an embedded system for critical applications, as well as integrated into larger systems such as Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2). For this reason, Feelbert has been tested in both scenarios, demonstrating satisfactory results both in terms of reference tracking and temporal predictability, whether integrated into ROS 2 or compiled as a standalone application on a Raspberry Pi 5.
