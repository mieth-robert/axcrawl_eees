Title: MambaStyle: Efficient StyleGAN Inversion for Real Image Editing with State-Space Models
Authors: Jhon Lopez, Carlos Hinojosa, Henry Arguello, Bernard Ghanem
Abstract: The task of inverting real images into StyleGAN's latent space to manipulate their attributes has been extensively studied. However, existing GAN inversion methods struggle to balance high reconstruction quality, effective editability, and computational efficiency. In this paper, we introduce MambaStyle, an efficient single-stage encoder-based approach for GAN inversion and editing that leverages vision state-space models (VSSMs) to address these challenges. Specifically, our approach integrates VSSMs within the proposed architecture, enabling high-quality image inversion and flexible editing with significantly fewer parameters and reduced computational complexity compared to state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments show that MambaStyle achieves a superior balance among inversion accuracy, editing quality, and computational efficiency. Notably, our method achieves superior inversion and editing results with reduced model complexity and faster inference, making it suitable for real-time applications.

Title: RadarRGBD A Multi-Sensor Fusion Dataset for Perception with RGB-D and mmWave Radar
Authors: Tieshuai Song, Jiandong Ye, Ao Guo, Guidong He, Bin Yang
Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion has significant potential in perception tasks for both indoor and outdoor environments. Especially under challenging conditions such as adverse weather and low-light environments, the combined use of millimeter-wave radar and RGB-D sensors has shown distinct advantages. However, existing multi-sensor datasets in the fields of autonomous driving and robotics often lack high-quality millimeter-wave radar data. To address this gap, we present a new multi-sensor dataset:RadarRGBD. This dataset includes RGB-D data, millimeter-wave radar point clouds, and raw radar matrices, covering various indoor and outdoor scenes, as well as low-light environments. Compared to existing datasets, RadarRGBD employs higher-resolution millimeter-wave radar and provides raw data, offering a new research foundation for the fusion of millimeter-wave radar and visual sensors. Furthermore, to tackle the noise and gaps in depth maps captured by Kinect V2 due to occlusions and mismatches, we fine-tune an open-source relative depth estimation framework, incorporating the absolute depth information from the dataset for depth supervision. We also introduce pseudo-relative depth scale information to further optimize the global depth scale estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively fills in missing regions in sensor data. Our dataset and related documentation will be publicly available at: this https URL.

Title: P3Net: Progressive and Periodic Perturbation for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Zhenyan Yao, Miao Zhang, Lanhu Wu, Yongri Piao, Feng Tian, Weibing Sun, Huchuan Lu
Abstract: Perturbation with diverse unlabeled data has proven beneficial for semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS). While many works have successfully used various perturbation techniques, a deeper understanding of learning perturbations is needed. Excessive or inappropriate perturbation can have negative effects, so we aim to address two challenges: how to use perturbation mechanisms to guide the learning of unlabeled data through labeled data, and how to ensure accurate predictions in boundary regions. Inspired by human progressive and periodic learning, we propose a progressive and periodic perturbation mechanism (P3M) and a boundary-focused loss. P3M enables dynamic adjustment of perturbations, allowing the model to gradually learn them. Our boundary-focused loss encourages the model to concentrate on boundary regions, enhancing sensitivity to intricate details and ensuring accurate predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two 2D and 3D datasets. Moreover, P3M is extendable to other methods, and the proposed loss serves as a universal tool for improving existing methods, highlighting the scalability and applicability of our approach.

Title: ASVspoof2019 vs. ASVspoof5: Assessment and Comparison
Authors: Avishai Weizman, Yehuda Ben-Shimol, Itshak Lapidot
Abstract: ASVspoof challenges are designed to advance the understanding of spoofing speech attacks and encourage the development of robust countermeasure systems. These challenges provide a standardized database for assessing and comparing spoofing-robust automatic speaker verification solutions. The ASVspoof5 challenge introduces a shift in database conditions compared to ASVspoof2019. While ASVspoof2019 has mismatched conditions only in spoofing attacks in the evaluation set, ASVspoof5 incorporates mismatches in both bona fide and spoofed speech statistics. This paper examines the impact of these mismatches, presenting qualitative and quantitative comparisons within and between the two databases. We show the increased difficulty for genuine and spoofed speech and demonstrate that in ASVspoof5, not only are the attacks more challenging, but the genuine speech also shifts toward spoofed speech compared to ASVspoof2019.

Title: Gaussian Processes in Power Systems: Techniques, Applications, and Future Works
Authors: Bendong Tan, Tong Su, Yu Weng, Ketian Ye, Parikshit Pareek, Petr Vorobev, Hung Nyugen, Junbo Zhao, Deepjyoti Deka
Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) and distributed energy resources (DERs) has significantly heightened operational complexity and uncertainty in modern power systems. Concurrently, the widespread deployment of smart meters, phasor measurement units (PMUs) and other sensors has generated vast spatiotemporal data streams, enabling advanced data-driven analytics and decision-making in grid operations. In this context, Gaussian processes (GPs) have emerged as a powerful probabilistic framework, offering uncertainty quantification, non-parametric modeling, and predictive capabilities to enhance power system analysis and control. This paper presents a comprehensive review of GP techniques and their applications in power system operation and control. GP applications are reviewed across three key domains: GP-based modeling, risk assessment, and optimization and control. These areas serve as representative examples of how GP can be utilized in power systems. Furthermore, critical challenges in GP applications are discussed, and potential research directions are outlined to facilitate future power system operations.

Title: Towards Holistic Evaluation of Large Audio-Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey
Authors: Chih-Kai Yang, Neo S. Ho, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: With advancements in large audio-language models (LALMs), which enhance large language models (LLMs) with auditory capabilities, these models are expected to demonstrate universal proficiency across various auditory tasks. While numerous benchmarks have emerged to assess LALMs' performance, they remain fragmented and lack a structured taxonomy. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive survey and propose a systematic taxonomy for LALM evaluations, categorizing them into four dimensions based on their objectives: (1) General Auditory Awareness and Processing, (2) Knowledge and Reasoning, (3) Dialogue-oriented Ability, and (4) Fairness, Safety, and Trustworthiness. We provide detailed overviews within each category and highlight challenges in this field, offering insights into promising future directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey specifically focused on the evaluations of LALMs, providing clear guidelines for the community. We will release the collection of the surveyed papers and actively maintain it to support ongoing advancements in the field.

Title: Analyzing the Impact of Accent on English Speech: Acoustic and Articulatory Perspectives
Authors: Gowtham Premananth, Vinith Kugathasan, Carol Espy-Wilson
Abstract: Advancements in AI-driven speech-based applications have transformed diverse industries ranging from healthcare to customer service. However, the increasing prevalence of non-native accented speech in global interactions poses significant challenges for speech-processing systems, which are often trained on datasets dominated by native speech. This study investigates accented English speech through articulatory and acoustic analysis, identifying simpler coordination patterns and higher average pitch than native speech. Using eigenspectra and Vocal Tract Variable-based coordination features, we establish an efficient method for quantifying accent strength without relying on resource-intensive phonetic transcriptions. Our findings provide a new avenue for research on the impacts of accents on speech intelligibility and offer insights for developing inclusive, robust speech processing systems that accommodate diverse linguistic communities.

Title: A Quantum-Enhanced Power Flow and Optimal Power Flow based on Combinatorial Reformulation
Authors: Zeynab Kaseb, Matthias Moller, Peter Palensky, Pedro P. Vergara
Abstract: This study introduces the Adiabatic Quantum Power Flow (AQPF) and Adiabatic Quantum Optimal Power Flow (AQOPF) algorithms to solve power flow (PF) and optimal power flow (OPF) problems, respectively. These algorithms utilize a novel combinatorial optimization reformulation of classical PF and OPF problems, and hence, enable their implementation on Ising machines, e.g., quantum and quantum-inspired hardware. The experiments are conducted on standard test cases ranging from 4-bus to 1354-bus systems, using D-Wave's Advantage system (QA), D-Wave's quantum-classical hybrid solver (HA), Fujitsu's Digital Annealer V3 (DAv3), and Fujitsu's Quantum-Inspired Integrated Optimization software (QIIO). The annealers are systematically evaluated based on: (i) full and partitioned formulations, (ii) ability to handle ill-conditioned cases, and (iii) scalability. The results are benchmarked against the Newton-Raphson numerical method (NR) and suggest that AQPF and AQOPF can serve as effective solvers or complementary tools to classical methods to address unsolved challenges in large-scale modern power systems.

Title: Diffusion Probabilistic Generative Models for Accelerated, in-NICU Permanent Magnet Neonatal MRI
Authors: Yamin Arefeen, Brett Levac, Bhairav Patel, Chang Ho, Jonathan I. Tamir
Abstract: Purpose: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) enables non-invasive assessment of brain abnormalities during early life development. Permanent magnet scanners operating in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) facilitate MRI of sick infants, but have long scan times due to lower signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and limited receive coils. This work accelerates in-NICU MRI with diffusion probabilistic generative models by developing a training pipeline accounting for these challenges. Methods: We establish a novel training dataset of clinical, 1 Tesla neonatal MR images in collaboration with Aspect Imaging and Sha'are Zedek Medical Center. We propose a pipeline to handle the low quantity and SNR of our real-world dataset (1) modifying existing network architectures to support varying resolutions; (2) training a single model on all data with learned class embedding vectors; (3) applying self-supervised denoising before training; and (4) reconstructing by averaging posterior samples. Retrospective under-sampling experiments, accounting for signal decay, evaluated each item of our proposed methodology. A clinical reader study with practicing pediatric neuroradiologists evaluated our proposed images reconstructed from 1.5x under-sampled data. Results: Combining all data, denoising pre-training, and averaging posterior samples yields quantitative improvements in reconstruction. The generative model decouples the learned prior from the measurement model and functions at two acceleration rates without re-training. The reader study suggests that proposed images reconstructed from approximately 1.5x under-sampled data are adequate for clinical use. Conclusion: Diffusion probabilistic generative models applied with the proposed pipeline to handle challenging real-world datasets could reduce scan time of in-NICU neonatal MRI.

Title: AI-Assisted NLOS Sensing for RIS-Based Indoor Localization in Smart Factories
Authors: Taofeek A.O. Yusuf, Sigurd S. Petersen, Puchu Li, Jian Ren, Placido Mursia, Vincenzo Sciancalepore, Xavier Costa Pérez, Gilberto Berardinelli, Ming Shen
Abstract: In the era of Industry 4.0, precise indoor localization is vital for automation and efficiency in smart factories. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) are emerging as key enablers in 6G networks for joint sensing and communication. However, RIS faces significant challenges in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) and multipath propagation, particularly in localization scenarios, where detecting NLOS conditions is crucial for ensuring not only reliable results and increased connectivity but also the safety of smart factory personnel. This study introduces an AI-assisted framework employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) customized for accurate Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) classification to enhance RIS-based localization using measured, synthetic, mixed-measured, and mixed-synthetic experimental data, that is, original, augmented, slightly noisy, and highly noisy data, respectively. Validated through such data from three different environments, the proposed customized-CNN (cCNN) model achieves {95.0\%-99.0\%} accuracy, outperforming standard pre-trained models like Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG-16) with an accuracy of {85.5\%-88.0\%}. By addressing RIS limitations in NLOS scenarios, this framework offers scalable and high-precision localization solutions for 6G-enabled smart factories.

Title: Application of Quaternions to Obtain Analytic Solutions to Systems of Polarization Components
Authors: Michael G. Taylor
Abstract: The usual way to describe mathematically a beam of coherent light passing through a system of waveplates is via the Jones vector and Jones matrix. This paper will show that a quaternion can be used to represent both the optical signal and the waveplate component it passes through, replacing the Jones vector and the Jones matrix. The quaternion description is easier to manipulate than the matrix-vector description; for example it can be inverted. As well as the Jones vector, the state of polarization (SOP) of an optical signal is often described as a three-dimensional vector on the Poincaré sphere, or as a polarization ellipse, and it will be shown how these three forms are closely related to the quaternion representation. Similarly, the action of a waveplate may be represented as a rotation about an axis on the Poincaré sphere, and that rotation is shown to have a logarithm-exponential relationship to the waveplate's quaternion. The paper presents rules to decide if two optical signals are aligned or orthogonal in phase or in polarization from their quaternions, and presents the quaternion operations to change the phase or change the SOP. Light passing through a system of waveplates is written as a product of quaternions, and it can be hard to simplify or manipulate that expression because quaternion multiplication does not commute. The paper brings together several mathematical tools that allow such a quaternion product to be rearranged, including the new idea of partial conjugation. Finally, a worked example is included of the quaternion mathematics applied to a waveplate problem that has not been solved before. It is shown that an endless optical phase shifter can be built using three rotatable waveplates, and equations for the angles of rotation are derived to produce the desired phase shift for given input and output SOPs.

Title: Benchmarking Chest X-ray Diagnosis Models Across Multinational Datasets
Authors: Qinmei Xu, Yiheng Li, Xianghao Zhan, Ahmet Gorkem Er, Brittany Dashevsky, Chuanjun Xu, Mohammed Alawad, Mengya Yang, Liu Ya, Changsheng Zhou, Xiao Li, Haruka Itakura, Olivier Gevaert
Abstract: Foundation models leveraging vision-language pretraining have shown promise in chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation, yet their real-world performance across diverse populations and diagnostic tasks remains insufficiently evaluated. This study benchmarks the diagnostic performance and generalizability of foundation models versus traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on multinational CXR datasets. We evaluated eight CXR diagnostic models - five vision-language foundation models and three CNN-based architectures - across 37 standardized classification tasks using six public datasets from the USA, Spain, India, and Vietnam, and three private datasets from hospitals in China. Performance was assessed using AUROC, AUPRC, and other metrics across both shared and dataset-specific tasks. Foundation models outperformed CNNs in both accuracy and task coverage. MAVL, a model incorporating knowledge-enhanced prompts and structured supervision, achieved the highest performance on public (mean AUROC: 0.82; AUPRC: 0.32) and private (mean AUROC: 0.95; AUPRC: 0.89) datasets, ranking first in 14 of 37 public and 3 of 4 private tasks. All models showed reduced performance on pediatric cases, with average AUROC dropping from 0.88 +/- 0.18 in adults to 0.57 +/- 0.29 in children (p = 0.0202). These findings highlight the value of structured supervision and prompt design in radiologic AI and suggest future directions including geographic expansion and ensemble modeling for clinical deployment.

Authors: Shuvashis Sarker, Shamim Rahim Refat, Faika Fairuj Preotee, Tanvir Rouf Shawon, Raihan Tanvir
Abstract: Advanced diagnostic instruments are crucial for the accurate detection and treatment of lung diseases, which affect millions of individuals globally. This study examines the effectiveness of deep learning and transfer learning models using a hybrid dataset, created by merging four individual datasets from Bangladesh and global sources. The hybrid dataset significantly enhances model accuracy and generalizability, particularly in detecting COVID-19, pneumonia, lung opacity, and normal lung conditions from chest X-ray images. A range of models, including CNN, VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, Xception, ResNet50V2, InceptionResNetV2, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet121, were applied to both individual and hybrid datasets. The results showed superior performance on the hybrid dataset, with VGG16, Xception, ResNet50V2, and DenseNet121 each achieving an accuracy of 99%. This consistent performance across the hybrid dataset highlights the robustness of these models in handling diverse data while maintaining high accuracy. To understand the models implicit behavior, explainable AI techniques were employed to illuminate their black-box nature. Specifically, LIME was used to enhance the interpretability of model predictions, especially in cases of misclassification, contributing to the development of reliable and interpretable AI-driven solutions for medical imaging.

Title: Multimodal Biomarkers for Schizophrenia: Towards Individual Symptom Severity Estimation
Authors: Gowtham Premananth, Philip Resnik, Sonia Bansal, Deanna L.Kelly, Carol Espy-Wilson
Abstract: Studies on schizophrenia assessments using deep learning typically treat it as a classification task to detect the presence or absence of the disorder, oversimplifying the condition and reducing its clinical applicability. This traditional approach overlooks the complexity of schizophrenia, limiting its practical value in healthcare settings. This study shifts the focus to individual symptom severity estimation using a multimodal approach that integrates speech, video, and text inputs. We develop unimodal models for each modality and a multimodal framework to improve accuracy and robustness. By capturing a more detailed symptom profile, this approach can help in enhancing diagnostic precision and support personalized treatment, offering a scalable and objective tool for mental health assessment.

Title: A Distributed Local Energy Market Clearing Framework Using a Two-Loop ADMM Method
Authors: Milad Kabirifar, Biswarup Mukherjee, S. Gokul Krishnan, Charalambos Konstantinou, Subhash Lakshminarayana
Abstract: The diversity of prosumers' resources in energy communities can provide significant technical and economic benefits to both prosumers and the distribution system operator (DSO). To maximize these benefits, a coordination framework is required to address all techno-economic constraints as well as the objectives of all agents. This paper presents a fully distributed market-clearing scheme to coordinate the strategies of agents within a local energy community. In the proposed framework, prosumers, the DSO, and the local market operator (LMO) are the participating agents. The framework addresses the preferences and techno-economic constraints of all actors while preserving their privacy. The proposed model is based on a modified alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method with two outer and inner loops; the outer loop models the interactions between the LMO and prosumers, while the inner loop addresses the interactions between the LMO and the DSO. The model is demonstrated on IEEE-69bus test network, showcasing its effectiveness from various perspectives.

Title: AudioMorphix: Training-free audio editing with diffusion probabilistic models
Authors: Jinhua Liang, Yuanzhe Chen, Yi Yuan, Dongya Jia, Xiaobin Zhuang, Zhuo Chen, Yuping Wang, Yuxuan Wang
Abstract: Editing sound with precision is a crucial yet underexplored challenge in audio content creation. While existing works can manipulate sounds by text instructions or audio exemplar pairs, they often struggled to modify audio content precisely while preserving fidelity to the original recording. In this work, we introduce a novel editing approach that enables localized modifications to specific time-frequency regions while keeping the remaining of the audio intact by operating on spectrograms directly. To achieve this, we propose AudioMorphix, a training-free audio editor that manipulates a target region on the spectrogram by referring to another recording. Inspired by morphing theory, we conceptualize audio mixing as a process where different sounds blend seamlessly through morphing and can be decomposed back into individual components via demorphing. Our AudioMorphix optimizes the noised latent conditioned on raw input and reference audio while rectifying the guided diffusion process through a series of energy functions. Additionally, we enhance self-attention layers with a cache mechanism to preserve detailed characteristics from the original recordings. To advance audio editing research, we devise a new evaluation benchmark, which includes a curated dataset with a variety of editing instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AudioMorphix yields promising performance on various audio editing tasks, including addition, removal, time shifting and stretching, and pitch shifting, achieving high fidelity and precision.

Title: OSCAR: One-Step Diffusion Codec Across Multiple Bit-rates
Authors: Jinpei Guo, Yifei Ji, Zheng Chen, Kai Liu, Min Liu, Wang Rao, Wenbo Li, Yong Guo, Yulun Zhang
Abstract: Pretrained latent diffusion models have shown strong potential for lossy image compression, owing to their powerful generative priors. Most existing diffusion-based methods reconstruct images by iteratively denoising from random noise, guided by compressed latent representations. While these approaches have achieved high reconstruction quality, their multi-step sampling process incurs substantial computational overhead. Moreover, they typically require training separate models for different compression bit-rates, leading to significant training and storage costs. To address these challenges, we propose a one-step diffusion codec across multiple bit-rates. termed OSCAR. Specifically, our method views compressed latents as noisy variants of the original latents, where the level of distortion depends on the bit-rate. This perspective allows them to be modeled as intermediate states along a diffusion trajectory. By establishing a mapping from the compression bit-rate to a pseudo diffusion timestep, we condition a single generative model to support reconstructions at multiple bit-rates. Meanwhile, we argue that the compressed latents retain rich structural information, thereby making one-step denoising feasible. Thus, OSCAR replaces iterative sampling with a single denoising pass, significantly improving inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OSCAR achieves superior performance in both quantitative and visual quality metrics. The code and models will be released at this https URL.

Title: Beamforming-Codebook-Aware Channel Knowledge Map Construction for Multi-Antenna Systems
Authors: Haohan Wang, Xu Shi, Hengyu Zhang, Yashuai Cao, Jintao Wang
Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) has emerged as a crucial technology for next-generation communication, enabling the construction of high-fidelity mappings between spatial environments and channel parameters via electromagnetic information analysis. Traditional CKM construction methods like ray tracing are computationally intensive. Recent studies utilizing neural networks (NNs) have achieved efficient CKM generation with reduced computational complexity and real-time processing capabilities. Nevertheless, existing research predominantly focuses on single-antenna systems, failing to address the beamforming requirements inherent to MIMO configurations. Given that appropriate precoding vector selection in MIMO systems can substantially enhance user communication rates, this paper presents a TransUNet-based framework for constructing CKM, which effectively incorporates discrete Fourier transform (DFT) precoding vectors. The proposed architecture combines a UNet backbone for multiscale feature extraction with a Transformer module to capture global dependencies among encoded linear vectors. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning (DL) approaches, yielding a 17\% improvement in RMSE compared to RadioWNet. The code is publicly accessible at this https URL.

Title: Compressing Human Body Video with Interactive Semantics: A Generative Approach
Authors: Bolin Chen, Shanzhi Yin, Hanwei Zhu, Lingyu Zhu, Zihan Zhang, Jie Chen, Ru-Ling Liao, Shiqi Wang, Yan Ye
Abstract: In this paper, we propose to compress human body video with interactive semantics, which can facilitate video coding to be interactive and controllable by manipulating semantic-level representations embedded in the coded bitstream. In particular, the proposed encoder employs a 3D human model to disentangle nonlinear dynamics and complex motion of human body signal into a series of configurable embeddings, which are controllably edited, compactly compressed, and efficiently transmitted. Moreover, the proposed decoder can evolve the mesh-based motion fields from these decoded semantics to realize the high-quality human body video reconstruction. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed framework can achieve promising compression performance for human body videos at ultra-low bitrate ranges compared with the state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC) and the latest generative compression schemes. Furthermore, the proposed framework enables interactive human body video coding without any additional pre-/post-manipulation processes, which is expected to shed light on metaverse-related digital human communication in the future.

Title: Partitioning and Observability in Linear Systems via Submodular Optimization
Authors: Mohamad H. Kazma, Ahmad F. Taha
Abstract: Network partitioning has gained recent attention as a pathway to enable decentralized operation and control in large-scale systems. This paper addresses the interplay between partitioning, observability, and sensor placement (SP) in dynamic networks. The problem, being computationally intractable at scale, is largely unexplored in the literature. To that end, the paper's objective is designing scalable partitioning of linear systems while maximizing observability metrics of the subsystems. We show that the partitioning problem can be posed as a submodular maximization problem -- and the SP problem can subsequently be solved over the partitioned network. Consequently, theoretical bounds are derived to compare observability metrics of the original network with those of the resulting partitions, highlighting the impact of partitioning on system observability. Case studies on networks of varying sizes corroborate the derived theoretical bounds.

Title: Generative Latent Coding for Ultra-Low Bitrate Image and Video Compression
Authors: Linfeng Qi, Zhaoyang Jia, Jiahao Li, Bin Li, Houqiang Li, Yan Lu
Abstract: Most existing approaches for image and video compression perform transform coding in the pixel space to reduce redundancy. However, due to the misalignment between the pixel-space distortion and human perception, such schemes often face the difficulties in achieving both high-realism and high-fidelity at ultra-low bitrate. To solve this problem, we propose \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{L}atent \textbf{C}oding (\textbf{GLC}) models for image and video compression, termed GLC-image and GLC-Video. The transform coding of GLC is conducted in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE). Compared to the pixel-space, such a latent space offers greater sparsity, richer semantics and better alignment with human perception, and show its advantages in achieving high-realism and high-fidelity compression. To further enhance performance, we improve the hyper prior by introducing a spatial categorical hyper module in GLC-image and a spatio-temporal categorical hyper module in GLC-video. Additionally, the code-prediction-based loss function is proposed to enhance the semantic consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our scheme shows high visual quality at ultra-low bitrate for both image and video compression. For image compression, GLC-image achieves an impressive bitrate of less than $0.04$ bpp, achieving the same FID as previous SOTA model MS-ILLM while using $45\%$ fewer bitrate on the CLIC 2020 test set. For video compression, GLC-video achieves 65.3\% bitrate saving over PLVC in terms of DISTS.

Title: Meta-PerSER: Few-Shot Listener Personalized Speech Emotion Recognition via Meta-learning
Authors: Liang-Yeh Shen, Shi-Xin Fang, Yi-Cheng Lin, Huang-Cheng Chou, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: This paper introduces Meta-PerSER, a novel meta-learning framework that personalizes Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) by adapting to each listener's unique way of interpreting emotion. Conventional SER systems rely on aggregated annotations, which often overlook individual subtleties and lead to inconsistent predictions. In contrast, Meta-PerSER leverages a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) approach enhanced with Combined-Set Meta-Training, Derivative Annealing, and per-layer per-step learning rates, enabling rapid adaptation with only a few labeled examples. By integrating robust representations from pre-trained self-supervised models, our framework first captures general emotional cues and then fine-tunes itself to personal annotation styles. Experiments on the IEMOCAP corpus demonstrate that Meta-PerSER significantly outperforms baseline methods in both seen and unseen data scenarios, highlighting its promise for personalized emotion recognition.

Title: Dysfluent WFST: A Framework for Zero-Shot Speech Dysfluency Transcription and Detection
Authors: Chenxu Guo, Jiachen Lian, Xuanru Zhou, Jinming Zhang, Shuhe Li, Zongli Ye, Hwi Joo Park, Anaisha Das, Zoe Ezzes, Jet Vonk, Brittany Morin, Rian Bogley, Lisa Wauters, Zachary Miller, Maria Gorno-Tempini, Gopala Anumanchipalli
Abstract: Automatic detection of speech dysfluency aids speech-language pathologists in efficient transcription of disordered speech, enhancing diagnostics and treatment planning. Traditional methods, often limited to classification, provide insufficient clinical insight, and text-independent models misclassify dysfluency, especially in context-dependent cases. This work introduces Dysfluent-WFST, a zero-shot decoder that simultaneously transcribes phonemes and detects dysfluency. Unlike previous models, Dysfluent-WFST operates with upstream encoders like WavLM and requires no additional training. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in both phonetic error rate and dysfluency detection on simulated and real speech data. Our approach is lightweight, interpretable, and effective, demonstrating that explicit modeling of pronunciation behavior in decoding, rather than complex architectures, is key to improving dysfluency processing systems.

Title: PCMamba: Physics-Informed Cross-Modal State Space Model for Dual-Camera Compressive Hyperspectral Imaging
Authors: Ge Meng, Zhongnan Cai, Jingyan Tu, Yingying Wang, Chenxin Li, Yue Huang, Xinghao Ding
Abstract: Panchromatic (PAN) -assisted Dual-Camera Compressive Hyperspectral Imaging (DCCHI) is a key technology in snapshot hyperspectral imaging. Existing research primarily focuses on exploring spectral information from 2D compressive measurements and spatial information from PAN images in an explicit manner, leading to a bottleneck in HSI reconstruction. Various physical factors, such as temperature, emissivity, and multiple reflections between objects, play a critical role in the process of a sensor acquiring hyperspectral thermal signals. Inspired by this, we attempt to investigate the interrelationships between physical properties to provide deeper theoretical insights for HSI reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a Physics-Informed Cross-Modal State Space Model Network (PCMamba) for DCCHI, which incorporates the forward physical imaging process of HSI into the linear complexity of Mamba to facilitate lightweight and high-quality HSI reconstruction. Specifically, we analyze the imaging process of hyperspectral thermal signals to enable the network to disentangle the three key physical properties-temperature, emissivity, and texture. By fully exploiting the potential information embedded in 2D measurements and PAN images, the HSIs are reconstructed through a physics-driven synthesis process. Furthermore, we design a Cross-Modal Scanning Mamba Block (CSMB) that introduces inter-modal pixel-wise interaction with positional inductive bias by cross-scanning the backbone features and PAN features. Extensive experiments conducted on both real and simulated datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms SOTA methods in both quantitative and qualitative metrics.

Title: Scalable and Efficient Aggregation of Energy-Constrained Flexible Loads
Authors: Julie Rousseau, Philipp Heer, Kristina Orehounig, Gabriela Hug
Abstract: Loads represent a promising flexibility source to support the integration of renewable energy sources, as they may shift their energy consumption over time. By computing the aggregated flexibility of power and energy-constrained loads, aggregators can communicate the group's flexibility without sharing individual private information. However, this computation is, in practice, challenging. Some studies suggest different inner approximations of aggregated flexibility polytopes, but all suffer from large computational costs for realistic load numbers and horizon lengths. In this paper, we develop a novel approximation of the aggregated flexibility of loads based on the concept of worst-case energy dispatch, i.e., if aggregated energy consumptions are assumed to be dispatched in the worst manner possible. This leads to conservative piecewise linear bounds that restrict the aggregated energy consumption only based on the previous aggregated energy consumed. A comparative case study reveals that our method can compute an approximation of the aggregation of thousands of loads efficiently, while displaying an accuracy comparable to other approximation techniques.

Authors: Ming Cheng, Fei Su, Cancan Li, Juan Liu, Ming Li
Abstract: This paper describes the speaker diarization system developed for the Multimodal Information-Based Speech Processing (MISP) 2025 Challenge. First, we utilize the Sequence-to-Sequence Neural Diarization (S2SND) framework to generate initial predictions using single-channel audio. Then, we extend the original S2SND framework to create a new version, Multi-Channel Sequence-to-Sequence Neural Diarization (MC-S2SND), which refines the initial results using multi-channel audio. The final system achieves a diarization error rate (DER) of 8.09% on the evaluation set of the competition database, ranking first place in the speaker diarization task of the MISP 2025 Challenge.

Title: Coverage Path Planning For Multi-view SAR-UAV Observation System Under Energy Constraint
Authors: Deyu Song, Xiangyin Zhang, Zipei Yu, Kaiyu Qin
Abstract: Multi-view Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging can effectively enhance the performance of tasks such as automatic target recognition and image information fusion. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the advantages of flexible deployment and cost reduction. A swarm of UAVs equipped with synthetic aperture radar imaging equipment is well suited to meet the functional requirements of multi-view synthetic aperture radar imaging missions. However, to provide optimal paths for SAR-UAVs from the base station to cover target viewpoints in the mission area is of NP-hard computational complexity. In this work, the coverage path planning problem for multi-view SAR-UAV observation systems is studied. First, the coordinate of observation viewpoints is calculated based on the location of targets and base station under a brief geometric model. Then, the exact problem formulation is modeled in order to fully describe the solution space and search for optimal paths that provide maximum coverage rate for SAR-UAVs. Finally, an Adaptive Density Peak Clustering (ADPC) method is proposed to overcome the additional energy consumption due to the viewpoints being far away from the base station. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is introduced for optimal path generation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed approach.

Title: Quantum-Driven Multihead Inland Waterbody Detection With Transformer-Encoded CYGNSS Delay-Doppler Map Data
Authors: Chia-Hsiang Lin, Jhao-Ting Lin, Po-Ying Chiu, Shih-Ping Chen, Charles C. H. Lin
Abstract: Inland waterbody detection (IWD) is critical for water resources management and agricultural planning. However, the development of high-fidelity IWD mapping technology remains unresolved. We aim to propose a practical solution based on the easily accessible data, i.e., the delay-Doppler map (DDM) provided by NASA's Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS), which facilitates effective estimation of physical parameters on the Earth's surface with high temporal resolution and wide spatial coverage. Specifically, as quantum deep network (QUEEN) has revealed its strong proficiency in addressing classification-like tasks, we encode the DDM using a customized transformer, followed by feeding the transformer-encoded DDM (tDDM) into a highly entangled QUEEN to distinguish whether the tDDM corresponds to a hydrological region. In recent literature, QUEEN has achieved outstanding performances in numerous challenging remote sensing tasks (e.g., hyperspectral restoration, change detection, and mixed noise removal, etc.), and its high effectiveness stems from the fundamentally different way it adopts to extract features (the so-called quantum unitary-computing features). The meticulously designed IWD-QUEEN retrieves high-precision river textures, such as those in Amazon River Basin in South America, demonstrating its superiority over traditional classification methods and existing global hydrography maps. IWD-QUEEN, together with its parallel quantum multihead scheme, works in a near-real-time manner (i.e., millisecond-level computing per DDM). To broaden accessibility for users of traditional computers, we also provide the non-quantum counterpart of our method, called IWD-Transformer, thereby increasing the impact of this work.

Title: Trajectory-Independent Flexibility Envelopes of Energy-Constrained Systems with State-Dependent Losses
Authors: Julie Rousseau, Carlo Tajoli, Hanmin Cai, Philipp Heer, Kristina Orehounig, Gabriela Hug
Abstract: As non-dispatchable renewable power units become prominent in electric power grids, demand-side flexibility appears as a key element of future power systems' operation. Power and energy bounds are intuitive metrics to describe the flexibility of energy-constrained loads. However, to be used in operation, any power consumption trajectory fulfilling the power and energy bounds must necessarily fulfill the load's constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate that energy bounds defined as the minimum and maximum energy consumption potential of a load with state-dependent losses are Trajectory-Dependent (TD), i.e., for any energy value in the bounds a feasible power trajectory exists, but not all power trajectories enclosed in the energy envelopes satisfy the load's constraints. To guarantee the satisfaction of load constraints for all trajectories, we define Trajectory-Independent (TI) energy bounds. We present TI envelope formulations for individual loads, as well as physically coupled loads and assess the proposed formulations in a building heating system, a system with state-dependent losses. We find that using a TD envelope as energy bounds in operation may yield room temperature up to 3.8°C higher and 3.4°C lower than admissible. Overall, poorly insulated buildings observe a TI energy envelope that differs significantly from their TD envelope.

Title: UBGAN: Enhancing Coded Speech with Blind and Guided Bandwidth Extension
Authors: Kishan Gupta, Srikanth Korse, Andreas Brendel, Nicola Pia, Guillaume Fuchs
Abstract: In practical application of speech codecs, a multitude of factors such as the quality of the radio connection, limiting hardware or required user experience necessitate trade-offs between achievable perceptual quality, engendered bitrate and computational complexity. Most conventional and neural speech codecs operate on wideband (WB) speech signals to achieve this compromise. To further enhance the perceptual quality of coded speech, bandwidth extension (BWE) of the transmitted speech is an attractive and popular technique in conventional speech coding. In contrast, neural speech codecs are typically trained end-to-end to a specific set of requirements and are often not easily adaptable. In particular, they are typically trained to operate at a single fixed sampling rate. With the Universal Bandwidth Extension Generative Adversarial Network (UBGAN), we propose a modular and lightweight GAN-based solution that increases the operational flexibility of a wide range of conventional and neural codecs. Our model operates in the subband domain and extends the bandwidth of WB signals from 8 kHz to 16 kHz, resulting in super-wideband (SWB) signals. We further introduce two variants, guided-UBGAN and blind-UBGAN, where the guided version transmits quantized learned representation as a side information at a very low bitrate additional to the bitrate of the codec, while blind-BWE operates without such side-information. Our subjective assessments demonstrate the advantage of UBGAN applied to WB codecs and highlight the generalization capacity of our proposed method across multiple codecs and bitrates.

Title: Robust Look-ahead Pursuit Control for Three-Dimensional Path Following within Finite-Time Stability Guarantee
Authors: Zimao Sheng, Hong an Yang, ZiRui Yu, Jiakang Wang
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenging problem of robust path following for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in complex environments with bounded external disturbances and non-smooth predefined paths. Due to the unique aerodynamic characteristics and flight constraints of fixed-wing UAVs, achieving accurate and stable path following remains difficult, especially in low-altitude mountainous terrains, urban landscapes, and under wind disturbances. Traditional path-following guidance laws often struggle with rapid stabilization and constrained input commands under unknown disturbances while maintaining robustness. To overcome these limitations, we propose a robust nonlinear path-following guidance law that considers the flight path angle and track angle, and dynamically adjusts controller parameters to achieve optimal compensation for acceleration increments. The proposed guidance law guarantees finite-time stability, reduced sensitivity to constrained uncertainties, and consistent behavior compared to traditional asymptotic convergence controllers. Additionally, it ensures that the UAV approaches mobile virtual target points in the shortest possible time while adhering to input constrained conditions. Our contributions include a thorough analysis of the conditions for robust stability, the derivation of the guidance law, and simulations demonstrating its effectiveness. The results show that the proposed guidance law significantly improves path-following performance under external disturbances, making it a promising solution for autonomous missions execution of fixed-wing UAVs.

Title: Synthesis of Ventilator Dyssynchrony Waveforms using a Hybrid Generative Model and a Lung Model
Authors: Sagar Deep Deb, Suvakash Dey, Deepak K. Agrawal
Abstract: Ventilator dyssynchrony (VD) is often described as a mismatch between a patient breathing effort and the ventilator support during mechanical ventilation. This mismatch is often associated with an increased risk of lung injury and longer hospital stays. The manual VD detection method is unreliable and requires considerable effort from medical professionals. Automating this process requires a computational pipeline that can identify VD breaths from continuous waveform signals. For that, while various machine learning (ML) models have been proposed, their accuracy is often limited due to the unavailability of a large, well-annotated VD waveform dataset. This paper presents a new approach combining mathematical and deep generative models to generate synthetic, clinically relevant VD waveforms. The mathematical model, which we call the VD lung ventilator model (VDLV), can accurately replicate clinically observable deformation in the pressure and volume waveforms. These temporal deformations are hypothesized to be related to specific VD breaths. We leverage the VDLV model to produce training waveform datasets covering normal and various VD breaths. These datasets are further diversified using deep learning models such as Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Conditional GAN (cGAN). The performance of both GAN and cGAN models is assessed through quantitative metrics, demonstrating that this hybrid approach effectively creates realistic and diverse VD waveforms. Notably, the pressure and volume cGAN models enable the generation of more precise and targeted VD signals. These improved synthetic waveform datasets have the potential to significantly enhance the accuracy and robustness of VD detection algorithms.

Title: HPP-Voice: A Large-Scale Evaluation of Speech Embeddings for Multi-Phenotypic Classification
Authors: David Krongauz, Hido Pinto, Sarah Kohn, Yanir Marmor, Eran Segal
Abstract: Human speech contains paralinguistic cues that reflect a speaker's physiological and neurological state, potentially enabling non-invasive detection of various medical phenotypes. We introduce the Human Phenotype Project Voice corpus (HPP-Voice): a dataset of 7,188 recordings in which Hebrew-speaking adults count for 30 seconds, with each speaker linked to up to 15 potentially voice-related phenotypes spanning respiratory, sleep, mental health, metabolic, immune, and neurological conditions. We present a systematic comparison of 14 modern speech embedding models, where modern speech embeddings from these 30-second counting tasks outperform MFCCs and demographics for downstream health condition classifications. We found that embedding learned from a speaker identification model can predict objectively measured moderate to severe sleep apnea in males with an AUC of 0.64 $\pm$ 0.03, while MFCC and demographic features led to AUCs of 0.56 $\pm$ 0.02 and 0.57 $\pm$ 0.02, respectively. Additionally, our results reveal gender-specific patterns in model effectiveness across different medical domains. For males, speaker identification and diarization models consistently outperformed speech foundation models for respiratory conditions (e.g., asthma: 0.61 $\pm$ 0.03 vs. 0.56 $\pm$ 0.02) and sleep-related conditions (insomnia: 0.65 $\pm$ 0.04 vs. 0.59 $\pm$ 0.05). For females, speaker diarization models performed best for smoking status (0.61 $\pm$ 0.02 vs 0.55 $\pm$ 0.02), while Hebrew-specific models performed best (0.59 $\pm$ 0.02 vs. 0.58 $\pm$ 0.02) in classifying anxiety compared to speech foundation models. Our findings provide evidence that a simple counting task can support large-scale, multi-phenotypic voice screening and highlight which embedding families generalize best to specific conditions, insights that can guide future vocal biomarker research and clinical deployment.

Title: A Tutorial on Beyond-Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: Modeling, Architectures, System Design and Optimization, and Applications
Authors: Hongyu Li, Matteo Nerini, Shanpu Shen, Bruno Clerckx
Abstract: Written by its inventors, this first tutorial on Beyond-Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (BD-RISs) provides the readers with the basics and fundamental tools necessary to appreciate, understand, and contribute to this emerging and disruptive technology. Conventional (Diagonal) RISs (D-RISs) are characterized by a diagonal scattering matrix $\mathbf{\Theta}$ such that the wave manipulation flexibility of D-RIS is extremely limited. In contrast, BD-RIS refers to a novel and general framework for RIS where its scattering matrix is not limited to be diagonal (hence, the ``beyond-diagonal'' terminology) and consequently, all entries of $\mathbf{\Theta}$ can potentially help shaping waves for much higher manipulation flexibility. This physically means that BD-RIS can artificially engineer and reconfigure coupling across elements of the surface thanks to inter-element reconfigurable components which allow waves absorbed by one element to flow through other elements. Consequently, BD-RIS opens the door to more general and versatile intelligent surfaces that subsumes existing RIS architectures as special cases. In this tutorial, we share all the secret sauce to model, design, and optimize BD-RIS and make BD-RIS transformative in many different applications. Topics discussed include physics-consistent and multi-port network-aided modeling; transmitting, reflecting, hybrid, and multi-sector mode analysis; reciprocal and non-reciprocal architecture designs and optimal performance-complexity Pareto frontier of BD-RIS; signal processing, optimization, and channel estimation for BD-RIS; hardware impairments (discrete-value impedance and admittance, lossy interconnections and components, wideband effects, mutual coupling) of BD-RIS; benefits and applications of BD-RIS in communications, sensing, power transfer.

Title: Neural network based control of unknown nonlinear systems via contraction analysis
Authors: Hao Yin, Claudio De Persis, Bayu Jayawardhana, Santiago Sanchez Escalonilla Plaza
Abstract: This paper studies the design of neural network (NN)-based controllers for unknown nonlinear systems, using contraction analysis. A Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) system is constructed by approximating the unknown draft dynamics with a feedforward NN. Incremental sector bounds and contraction theory are applied to the activation functions and the weights of the NN, respectively. It is demonstrated that if the incremental sector bounds and the weights satisfy some non-convex conditions, the NODE system is contractive. To improve computational efficiency, these non-convex conditions are reformulated as convex LMI conditions. Additionally, it is proven that when the NODE system is contractive, the trajectories of the original autonomous system converge to a neighborhood of the unknown equilibrium, with the size of this neighborhood determined by the approximation error. For a single-layer NN, the NODE system is simplified to a continuous-time Hopfield NN. If the NODE system does not satisfy the contraction conditions, an NN-based controller is designed to enforce contractivity. This controller integrates a linear component, which ensures contraction through suitable control gains, and an NN component, which compensates for the NODE system's nonlinearities. This integrated controller guarantees that the trajectories of the original affine system converge to a neighborhood of the unknown equilibrium. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through two illustrative examples.

Title: Data Center Model for Transient Stability Analysis of Power Systems
Authors: Alberto Jimenez-Ruiz, Federico Milano
Abstract: The rising demand of computing power leads to the installation of a large number of Data Centers (DCs). Their Fault-Ride-Through (FRT) behavior and their unique power characteristics, especially for DCs catered to Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads, pose a threat to the stability of power systems. To ensure its stability, it is required accurate models of the loads involved. Here we propose a dynamic load model that properly captures the behaviour of DCs. Its three most defining features are the use of an Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) which sits between the server load and the grid, the cooling load represented by an induction motor, and a pulsing load that represents the transients caused by contemporary DCs with significant AI workloads. The features of the proposed model and its impact on the dynamic performance of transmission systems are illustrated through a model of the all-island Irish transmission system and real-world data of the DCs currently connected to this system.

Title: Attractor-Based Speech Separation of Multiple Utterances by Unknown Number of Speakers
Authors: Yuzhu Wang, Archontis Politis, Konstantinos Drossos, Tuomas Virtanen
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of single-channel speech separation, where the number of speakers is unknown, and each speaker may speak multiple utterances. We propose a speech separation model that simultaneously performs separation, dynamically estimates the number of speakers, and detects individual speaker activities by integrating an attractor module. The proposed system outperforms existing methods by introducing an attractor-based architecture that effectively combines local and global temporal modeling for multi-utterance scenarios. To evaluate the method in reverberant and noisy conditions, a multi-speaker multi-utterance dataset was synthesized by combining Librispeech speech signals with WHAM! noise signals. The results demonstrate that the proposed system accurately estimates the number of sources. The system effectively detects source activities and separates the corresponding utterances into correct outputs in both known and unknown source count scenarios.

Title: Performance of Objective Speech Quality Metrics on Languages Beyond Validation Data: A Study of Turkish and Korean
Authors: Javier Perez, Dimme de Groot, Jorge Martinez
Abstract: Objective speech quality measures are widely used to assess the performance of video conferencing platforms and telecommunication systems. They predict human-rated speech quality and are crucial for assessing the systems quality of experience. Despite the widespread use, the quality measures are developed on a limited set of languages. This can be problematic since the performance on unseen languages is consequently not guaranteed or even studied. Here we raise awareness to this issue by investigating the performance of two objective speech quality measures (PESQ and ViSQOL) on Turkish and Korean. Using English as baseline, we show that Turkish samples have significantly higher ViSQOL scores and that for Turkish male speakers the correlation between PESQ and ViSQOL is highest. These results highlight the need to explore biases across metrics and to develop a labeled speech quality dataset with a variety of languages.

Title: Optimized Energy Harvesting in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Using Markov Process Evolution
Authors: Muhammad Zeeshan Mumtaz, Mohammadali Mohammadi, Hien Quoc Ngo, Michail Matthaiou
Abstract: This paper investigates a discrete energy state transition model for energy harvesting (EH) in cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) networks. A Markov chain-based stochastic process is conceived to characterize the temporal evolution of the user equipment (UE) energy level by leveraging state transition probabilities (STP) based on the energy differential ($\Delta E$) between the EH and consumed energy within each coherence interval. Tractable mathematical relationships are derived for the STP cases using a new stochastic model of non-linear EH, approximated using a Gamma distribution. This derivation leverages closed-form expressions for the mean and variance of the harvested energy. To improve the positive STP of the minimum energy UE among all network UEs, we aim to maximize the $\Delta E$ for this UE using two power allocation (PA) schemes. The first scheme is a heuristic PA using the relative channel characteristics to this UE from all access points (APs). The second scheme is the optimized PA based on the solution of a second-order conic problem to maximize the $\Delta E$ using a responsive primal-dual interior point method (PD-IPM) algorithm with modified backtracking line-search, iterating over multiple PA periods. Our simulation results illustrate that both the proposed PA schemes enhance the dynamic minimum UE energy level by around four-fold over full power control, along with the performance improvement attributed to spatial resource diversification of CF-mMIMO systems.

Title: Adversarial Deep Metric Learning for Cross-Modal Audio-Text Alignment in Open-Vocabulary Keyword Spotting
Authors: Youngmoon Jung, Yong-Hyeok Lee, Myunghun Jung, Jaeyoung Roh, Chang Woo Han, Hoon-Young Cho
Abstract: For text enrollment-based open-vocabulary keyword spotting (KWS), acoustic and text embeddings are typically compared at either the phoneme or utterance level. To facilitate this, we optimize acoustic and text encoders using deep metric learning (DML), enabling direct comparison of multi-modal embeddings in a shared embedding space. However, the inherent heterogeneity between audio and text modalities presents a significant challenge. To address this, we propose Modality Adversarial Learning (MAL), which reduces the domain gap in heterogeneous modality representations. Specifically, we train a modality classifier adversarially to encourage both encoders to generate modality-invariant embeddings. Additionally, we apply DML to achieve phoneme-level alignment between audio and text, and conduct comprehensive comparisons across various DML objectives. Experiments on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and LibriPhrase datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Title: SEED: Speaker Embedding Enhancement Diffusion Model
Authors: KiHyun Nam, Jungwoo Heo, Jee-weon Jung, Gangin Park, Chaeyoung Jung, Ha-Jin Yu, Joon Son Chung
Abstract: A primary challenge when deploying speaker recognition systems in real-world applications is performance degradation caused by environmental mismatch. We propose a diffusion-based method that takes speaker embeddings extracted from a pre-trained speaker recognition model and generates refined embeddings. For training, our approach progressively adds Gaussian noise to both clean and noisy speaker embeddings extracted from clean and noisy speech, respectively, via forward process of a diffusion model, and then reconstructs them to clean embeddings in the reverse process. While inferencing, all embeddings are regenerated via diffusion process. Our method needs neither speaker label nor any modification to the existing speaker recognition pipeline. Experiments on evaluation sets simulating environment mismatch scenarios show that our method can improve recognition accuracy by up to 19.6% over baseline models while retaining performance on conventional scenarios.

Title: Chirp Delay-Doppler Domain Modulation: A New Paradigm of Integrated Sensing and Communication for Autonomous Vehicles
Authors: Zhuoran Li, Shufeng Tan, Zhen Gao, Yi Tao, Zhonghuai Wu, Zhongxiang Li, Chun Hu, Dezhi Zheng
Abstract: Autonomous driving is reshaping the way humans travel, with millimeter wave (mmWave) radar playing a crucial role in this transformation to enabe vehicle-to-everything (V2X). Although chirp is widely used in mmWave radar systems for its strong sensing capabilities, the lack of integrated communication functions in existing systems may limit further advancement of autonomous driving. In light of this, we first design ``dedicated chirps" tailored for sensing chirp signals in the environment, facilitating the identification of idle time-frequency resources. Based on these dedicated chirps, we propose a chirp-division multiple access (Chirp-DMA) scheme, enabling multiple pairs of mmWave radar transceivers to perform integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) without interference. Subsequently, we propose two chirp-based delay-Doppler domain modulation schemes that enable each pair of mmWave radar transceivers to simultaneously sense and communicate within their respective time-frequency resource blocks. The modulation schemes are based on different multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar schemes: the time division multiplexing (TDM)-based scheme offers higher communication rates, while the Doppler division multiplexing (DDM)-based scheme is suitable for working in a lower signal-to-noise ratio range. We then validate the effectiveness of the proposed DDM-based scheme through simulations. Finally, we present some challenges and issues that need to be addressed to advance ISAC in V2X for better autonomous driving.

Title: OWP-IMU: An RSS-based Optical Wireless and IMU Indoor Positioning Dataset
Authors: Fan Wu, Jorik De Bruycker, Daan Delabie, Nobby Stevens, Francois Rottenberg, Lieven De Strycker
Abstract: Received signal strength (RSS)-based optical wireless positioning (OWP) systems are becoming popular for indoor localization because they are low-cost and accurate. However, few open-source datasets are available to test and analyze RSS-based OWP systems. In this paper, we collected RSS values at a sampling frequency of 27 Hz, inertial measurement unit (IMU) at a sampling frequency of 200 Hz and the ground truth at a sampling frequency of 160 Hz in two indoor environments. One environment has no obstacles, and the other has a metal column as an obstacle to represent a non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenario. We recorded data with a vehicle at three different speeds (low, medium and high). The dataset includes over 110 k data points and covers more than 80 min. We also provide benchmark tests to show localization performance using only RSS-based OWP and improve accuracy by combining IMU data via extended kalman filter. The dataset OWP-IMU is open source1 to support further research on indoor localization methods.

Title: On the Deployment of RIS-mounted UAV Networks
Authors: Anupam Mondal, Priyadarshi Mukherjee, Sasthi C. Ghosh
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) enable smart wireless environments by dynamically controlling signal propagation to enhance communication and localization. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can act as flying base stations and thus, improve system performance by avoiding signal blockages. In this paper, we propose a gradient ascent and coordinate search based method to determine the optimal location for a system that consists of a UAV and a RIS, where the UAV serves cellular users (CUs) and the RIS serves device-to-device (D2D) pairs. In particular, by optimizing the net throughput for both the D2D pairs and the CUs, the suggested method establishes the ideal location for the RIS-mounted UAV. We consider both line of sight (LoS) and non-LoS paths for the RIS and UAV to calculate the throughput while accounting for blockages in the system. The numerical results show that the proposed method performs better than the existing approaches in terms of both the net throughput and the user fairness.

Title: Unlocking Temporal Flexibility: Neural Speech Codec with Variable Frame Rate
Authors: Hanglei Zhang, Yiwei Guo, Zhihan Li, Xiang Hao, Xie Chen, Kai Yu
Abstract: Most neural speech codecs achieve bitrate adjustment through intra-frame mechanisms, such as codebook dropout, at a Constant Frame Rate (CFR). However, speech segments inherently have time-varying information density (e.g., silent intervals versus voiced regions). This property makes CFR not optimal in terms of bitrate and token sequence length, hindering efficiency in real-time applications. In this work, we propose a Temporally Flexible Coding (TFC) technique, introducing variable frame rate (VFR) into neural speech codecs for the first time. TFC enables seamlessly tunable average frame rates and dynamically allocates frame rates based on temporal entropy. Experimental results show that a codec with TFC achieves optimal reconstruction quality with high flexibility, and maintains competitive performance even at lower frame rates. Our approach is promising for the integration with other efforts to develop low-frame-rate neural speech codecs for more efficient downstream tasks.

Title: Active Speech Enhancement: Active Speech Denoising Decliping and Deveraberation
Authors: Ofir Yaish, Yehuda Mishaly, Eliya Nachmani
Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for active sound modification: Active Speech Enhancement (ASE). While Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) algorithms focus on suppressing external interference, ASE goes further by actively shaping the speech signal -- both attenuating unwanted noise components and amplifying speech-relevant frequencies -- to improve intelligibility and perceptual quality. To enable this, we propose a novel Transformer-Mamba-based architecture, along with a task-specific loss function designed to jointly optimize interference suppression and signal enrichment. Our method outperforms existing baselines across multiple speech processing tasks -- including denoising, dereverberation, and declipping -- demonstrating the effectiveness of active, targeted modulation in challenging acoustic environments.

Title: Modeling and Constraint-Aware Control of Pressure Dynamics in Water Electrolysis Systems
Authors: Mostafaali Ayubirad, Madiha Akbar, Hamid R. Ossareh
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of pressure constraint violations in water electrolysis systems operating under dynamic power conditions, a problem common to both Proton Exchange Membrane and alkaline technologies. To investigate this issue, a control-oriented model of an alkaline electrolyzer is developed, capturing key pressure and flow dynamics. To manage rapid power fluctuations that may cause pressure to exceed manufacturer-defined operational boundaries, a model-based constraint-aware power governor based on the Reference Governor (RG) framework is proposed. Simulation results show that the strategy effectively maintains pressure within the specified operating range, outperforming conventional filtering methods while enhancing hydrogen production and reducing auxiliary energy consumption.

Title: Delayed dynamic-feedback controller design for multi-frequency vibration suppression
Authors: Adrian Saldanha, Adam Peichl, Wim Michiels, Tomáš Vyhlídal
Abstract: We present a methodology for designing a dynamic controller with delayed output feedback for achieving non-collocated vibration suppression with a focus on the multi-frequency case. To synthesize the delay-based controller, we first remodel the system of equations as a delay-differential algebraic equation (DDAE) in such a way that existing tools for design of a static output feedback controller can be easily adapted. The problem of achieving non-collocated vibration suppression with sufficient damping is formulated as a constrained optimization problem of minimizing the spectral abscissa in the presence of zero-location constraints, with the constraints exhibiting polynomial dependence on its parameters. We transform the problem into an unconstrained one using elimination, following which we solve the resulting non-convex, non-smooth optimization problem.

Title: Refining Neural Activation Patterns for Layer-Level Concept Discovery in Neural Network-Based Receivers
Authors: Marko Tuononen, Duy Vu, Dani Korpi, Vesa Starck, Ville Hautamäki
Abstract: Concept discovery in neural networks often targets individual neurons or human-interpretable features, overlooking distributed layer-wide patterns. We study the Neural Activation Pattern (NAP) methodology, which clusters full-layer activation distributions to identify such layer-level concepts. Applied to visual object recognition and radio receiver models, we propose improved normalization, distribution estimation, distance metrics, and varied cluster selection. In the radio receiver model, distinct concepts did not emerge; instead, a continuous activation manifold shaped by Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) was observed -- highlighting SNR as a key learned factor, consistent with classical receiver behavior and supporting physical plausibility. Our enhancements to NAP improved in-distribution vs. out-of-distribution separation, suggesting better generalization and indirectly validating clustering quality. These results underscore the importance of clustering design and activation manifolds in interpreting and troubleshooting neural network behavior.

Title: Multilinear subspace learning for person re-identification based fusion of high order tensor features
Authors: Ammar Chouchane, Mohcene Bessaoudi, Hamza Kheddar, Abdelmalik Ouamane, Tiago Vieira, Mahmoud Hassaballah
Abstract: Video surveillance image analysis and processing is a challenging field in computer vision, with one of its most difficult tasks being Person Re-Identification (PRe-ID). PRe-ID aims to identify and track target individuals who have already been detected in a network of cameras, using a robust description of their pedestrian images. The success of recent research in person PRe-ID is largely due to effective feature extraction and representation, as well as the powerful learning of these features to reliably discriminate between pedestrian images. To this end, two powerful features, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Local Maximal Occurrence (LOMO), are modeled on multidimensional data using the proposed method, High-Dimensional Feature Fusion (HDFF). Specifically, a new tensor fusion scheme is introduced to leverage and combine these two types of features in a single tensor, even though their dimensions are not identical. To enhance the system's accuracy, we employ Tensor Cross-View Quadratic Analysis (TXQDA) for multilinear subspace learning, followed by cosine similarity for matching. TXQDA efficiently facilitates learning while reducing the high dimensionality inherent in high-order tensor data. The effectiveness of our approach is verified through experiments on three widely-used PRe-ID datasets: VIPeR, GRID, and PRID450S. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Characterization of Using Hybrid Beamforming in mmWave Virtual Reality
Authors: Nasim Alikhani, Abbas Mohammadi
Abstract: Wireless Virtual Reality (VR) is increasingly in demand in Wireless LANs (WLANs). In this paper, a utility function for resource management in wireless VR is proposed. Maximizing the sum rate metric in transmitting VR audio or videos is an important factor for ascertaining low latency in obtaining QoS requirement of users in VR, so forth mmWave frequency band in WLAN technology should be used. This frequency band is presented in IEEE 802.11ad/ay. Resource access method in IEEE 802.11ay standard is MultiUser MIMO (MU-MIMO) with OFDM modulation. Operating at mmWave frequency band is equal to use massive number of antenna to enhance the received power in (Line of Sight) LoS direction by inducing sever propagation with small wavelength. Also for reducing the complexity of hardware in mmWave technology, designers should select some number of connected phase shifters to each antenna element by hybrid beamforming method. Processing delay, transmission delay and queue delay should be considered in acquiring QoS metric in terms of utility function. The optimal closed form expression of the multi-attribute utility function is based on these delays that are calculated by downlink and uplink rates in assistant with hybrid beamforming. Trends of transmission delay and multi-attribute utility function in various Es/N0 values and different scenarios are analyzed. Based on these results, 95.4% accuracy in comparison with ns3 in uplink and downlink channel modeling in IEEE 802.11ay standard's indoor environment has been reported. Also, it is shown that min channel gain consideration can cause reduction in the value of the utility function and incursion in transmission delay in VR.

Title: Optimizing Resource Allocation for QoS and Stability in Dynamic VLC-NOMA Networks via MARL
Authors: Aubida A. Al-Hameed, Safwan Hafeedh Younus, Mohamad A. Ahmed, Abdullah Baz
Abstract: Visible Light Communication (VLC) combined with Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) offers a promising solution for dense indoor wireless networks. Yet, managing resources effectively is challenged by VLC network dynamic conditions involving user mobility and light dimming. In addition to satisfying Quality of Service (QoS) and network stability requirements. Traditional resource allocation methods and simpler RL approaches struggle to jointly optimize QoS and stability under the dynamic conditions of mobile VLC-NOMA networks. This paper presents MARL frameworks tailored to perform complex joint optimization of resource allocation (NOMA power, user scheduling) and network stability (interference, handovers), considering heterogeneous QoS, user mobility, and dimming in VLC-NOMA systems. Our MARL frameworks capture dynamic channel conditions and diverse user QoS , enabling effective joint optimization. In these frameworks, VLC access points (APs) act as intelligent agents, learning to allocate power and schedule users to satisfy diverse requirements while maintaining network stability by managing interference and minimizing disruptive handovers. We conduct a comparative analysis of two key MARL paradigms: 1) Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) and 2) Centralized Training with Centralized Execution (CTCE). Comprehensive simulations validate the effectiveness of both tailored MARL frameworks and demonstrate an ability to handle complex optimization. The results show key trade-offs, as the CTDE approach achieved approximately 16\% higher for High priority (HP) user QoS satisfaction, while the CTCE approach yielded nearly 7 dB higher average SINR and 12\% lower ping-pong handover ratio, offering valuable insights into the performance differences between these paradigms in complex VLC-NOMA network scenarios.

Abstract: Chromosome analysis is vital for diagnosing genetic disorders and guiding cancer therapy decisions through the identification of somatic clonal aberrations. However, developing an AI model are hindered by the overwhelming complexity and diversity of chromosomal abnormalities, requiring extensive annotation efforts, while automated methods remain task-specific and lack generalizability due to the scarcity of comprehensive datasets spanning diverse resource conditions. Here, we introduce CHROMA, a foundation model for cytogenomics, designed to overcome these challenges by learning generalizable representations of chromosomal abnormalities. Pre-trained on over 84,000 specimens (~4 million chromosomal images) via self-supervised learning, CHROMA outperforms other methods across all types of abnormalities, even when trained on fewer labelled data and more imbalanced datasets. By facilitating comprehensive mapping of instability and clonal leisons across various aberration types, CHROMA offers a scalable and generalizable solution for reliable and automated clinical analysis, reducing the annotation workload for experts and advancing precision oncology through the early detection of rare genomic abnormalities, enabling broad clinical AI applications and making advanced genomic analysis more accessible.

Title: Satellites Reveal Mobility: A Commuting Origin-destination Flow Generator for Global Cities
Authors: Can Rong, Xin Zhang, Yanxin Xi, Hongjie Sui, Jingtao Ding, Yong Li
Abstract: Commuting Origin-destination~(OD) flows, capturing daily population mobility of citizens, are vital for sustainable development across cities around the world. However, it is challenging to obtain the data due to the high cost of travel surveys and privacy concerns. Surprisingly, we find that satellite imagery, publicly available across the globe, contains rich urban semantic signals to support high-quality OD flow generation, with over 98\% expressiveness of traditional multisource hard-to-collect urban sociodemographic, economics, land use, and point of interest data. This inspires us to design a novel data generator, GlODGen, which can generate OD flow data for any cities of interest around the world. Specifically, GlODGen first leverages Vision-Language Geo-Foundation Models to extract urban semantic signals related to human mobility from satellite imagery. These features are then combined with population data to form region-level representations, which are used to generate OD flows via graph diffusion models. Extensive experiments on 4 continents and 6 representative cities show that GlODGen has great generalizability across diverse urban environments on different continents and can generate OD flow data for global cities highly consistent with real-world mobility data. We implement GlODGen as an automated tool, seamlessly integrating data acquisition and curation, urban semantic feature extraction, and OD flow generation together.

Authors: Yuan-Kuei Wu, Juan Azcarreta, Kashyap Patel, Buye Xu, Jung-Suk Lee, Sanha Lee, Ashutosh Pandey
Abstract: This study presents a deep-learning framework for controlling multichannel acoustic feedback in audio devices. Traditional digital signal processing methods struggle with convergence when dealing with highly correlated noise such as feedback. We introduce a Convolutional Recurrent Network that efficiently combines spatial and temporal processing, significantly enhancing speech enhancement capabilities with lower computational demands. Our approach utilizes three training methods: In-a-Loop Training, Teacher Forcing, and a Hybrid strategy with a Multichannel Wiener Filter, optimizing performance in complex acoustic environments. This scalable framework offers a robust solution for real-world applications, making significant advances in Acoustic Feedback Control technology.

Title: Constant-Sum High-Order Barrier Functions for Safety Between Parallel Boundaries
Authors: Kwang Hak Kim, Mamadou Diagne, Miroslav Krstić
Abstract: This paper takes a step towards addressing the difficulty of constructing Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for parallel safety boundaries. A single CBF for both boundaries has been reported to be difficult to validate for safety, and we identify why this challenge is inherent. To overcome this, the proposed method constructs separate CBFs for each boundary. We begin by presenting results for the relative degree one case and then extend these to higher relative degrees using the CBF backstepping technique, establishing conditions that guarantee safety. Finally, we showcase our method by applying it to a unicycle system, deriving a simple, verifiable condition to validate the target CBFs for direct implementation of our results.

Title: Directional Sparsity Based Statistical Channel Estimation for 6D Movable Antenna Communications
Authors: Xiaodan Shao, Rui Zhang, Jihong Park, Tony Q. S. Quek, Robert Schober, Xuemin Shen
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is an innovative and transformative technology to improve wireless network capacity by adjusting the 3D positions and 3D rotations of antennas/surfaces (sub-arrays) based on the channel spatial distribution. For optimization of the antenna positions and rotations, the acquisition of statistical channel state information (CSI) is essential for 6DMA systems. In this paper, we unveil for the first time a new \textbf{\textit{directional sparsity}} property of the 6DMA channels between the base station (BS) and the distributed users, where each user has significant channel gains only with a (small) subset of 6DMA position-rotation pairs, which can receive direct/reflected signals from the user. By exploiting this property, a covariance-based algorithm is proposed for estimating the statistical CSI in terms of the average channel power at a small number of 6DMA positions and rotations. Based on such limited channel power estimation, the average channel powers for all possible 6DMA positions and rotations in the BS movement region are reconstructed by further estimating the multi-path average power and direction-of-arrival (DOA) vectors of all users. Simulation results show that the proposed directional sparsity-based algorithm can achieve higher channel power estimation accuracy than existing benchmark schemes, while requiring a lower pilot overhead.

Title: Extremum Seeking for PDE Systems using Physics-Informed Neural Networks
Authors: Haojin Guo, Zongyi Guo, Jianguo Guo, Tiago Roux Oliveira
Abstract: Extremum Seeking (ES) is an effective real-time optimization method for PDE systems in cascade with nonlinear quadratic maps. To address PDEs in the feedback loop, a boundary control law and a re-design of the additive probing signal are mandatory. The latter, commonly called "trajectory generation" or "motion planning," involves designing perturbation signals that anticipate their propagation through PDEs. Specifically, this requires solving motion planning problems for systems governed by parabolic and hyperbolic PDEs. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) is a powerful tool for solving PDEs by embedding physical laws as constraints in the neural network's loss function, enabling efficient solutions for high-dimensional, nonlinear, and complex problems. This paper proposes a novel construction integrating PINN and ES, automating the motion planning process for specific PDE systems and eliminating the need for case-by-case analytical derivations. The proposed strategy efficiently extracts perturbation signals, optimizing the PDE system.

Title: A Hierarchical Optimization Framework Using Deep Reinforcement Learning for Task-Driven Bandwidth Allocation in 5G Teleoperation
Authors: Narges Golmohammadi, Madan Mohan Rayguru, Sabur Baidya
Abstract: The evolution of 5G wireless technology has revolutionized connectivity, enabling a diverse range of applications. Among these are critical use cases such as real time teleoperation, which demands ultra reliable low latency communications (URLLC) to ensure precise and uninterrupted control, and enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services, which cater to data-intensive applications requiring high throughput and bandwidth. In our scenario, there are two queues, one for eMBB users and one for URLLC users. In teleoperation tasks, control commands are received in the URLLC queue, where communication delays occur. The dynamic index (DI) controls the service rate, affecting the telerobotic (URLLC) queue. A separate queue models eMBB data traffic. Both queues are managed through network slicing and application delay constraints, leading to a unified Lagrangian-based Lyapunov optimization for efficient resource allocation. We propose a DRL based hierarchical optimization framework that consists of two levels. At the first level, network optimization dynamically allocates resources for eMBB and URLLC users using a Lagrangian functional and an actor critic network to balance competing objectives. At the second level, control optimization finetunes the best gains for robots, ensuring stability and responsiveness in network conditions. This hierarchical approach enhances both communication and control processes, ensuring efficient resource utilization and optimized performance across the network.

Title: Domain Adaptive Skin Lesion Classification via Conformal Ensemble of Vision Transformers
Authors: Mehran Zoravar, Shadi Alijani, Homayoun Najjaran
Abstract: Exploring the trustworthiness of deep learning models is crucial, especially in critical domains such as medical imaging decision support systems. Conformal prediction has emerged as a rigorous means of providing deep learning models with reliable uncertainty estimates and safety guarantees. However, conformal prediction results face challenges due to the backbone model's struggles in domain-shifted scenarios, such as variations in different sources. To aim this challenge, this paper proposes a novel framework termed Conformal Ensemble of Vision Transformers (CE-ViTs) designed to enhance image classification performance by prioritizing domain adaptation and model robustness, while accounting for uncertainty. The proposed method leverages an ensemble of vision transformer models in the backbone, trained on diverse datasets including HAM10000, Dermofit, and Skin Cancer ISIC datasets. This ensemble learning approach, calibrated through the combined mentioned datasets, aims to enhance domain adaptation through conformal learning. Experimental results underscore that the framework achieves a high coverage rate of 90.38\%, representing an improvement of 9.95\% compared to the HAM10000 model. This indicates a strong likelihood that the prediction set includes the true label compared to singular models. Ensemble learning in CE-ViTs significantly improves conformal prediction performance, increasing the average prediction set size for challenging misclassified samples from 1.86 to 3.075.

Title: CP-LLM: Context and Pixel Aware Large Language Model for Video Quality Assessment
Authors: Wen Wen, Yaohong Wu, Yue Sheng, Neil Birkbeck, Balu Adsumilli, Yilin Wang
Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a challenging research topic with broad applications. Effective VQA necessitates sensitivity to pixel-level distortions and a comprehensive understanding of video context to accurately determine the perceptual impact of distortions. Traditional hand-crafted and learning-based VQA models mainly focus on pixel-level distortions and lack contextual understanding, while recent LLM-based models struggle with sensitivity to small distortions or handle quality scoring and description as separate tasks. To address these shortcomings, we introduce CP-LLM: a Context and Pixel aware Large Language Model. CP-LLM is a novel multimodal LLM architecture featuring dual vision encoders designed to independently analyze perceptual quality at both high-level (video context) and low-level (pixel distortion) granularity, along with a language decoder subsequently reasons about the interplay between these aspects. This design enables CP-LLM to simultaneously produce robust quality scores and interpretable quality descriptions, with enhanced sensitivity to pixel distortions (e.g. compression artifacts). The model is trained via a multi-task pipeline optimizing for score prediction, description generation, and pairwise comparisons. Experiment results demonstrate that CP-LLM achieves state-of-the-art cross-dataset performance on established VQA benchmarks and superior robustness to pixel distortions, confirming its efficacy for comprehensive and practical video quality assessment in real-world scenarios.

Title: Source Separation by Flow Matching
Authors: Robin Scheibler, John R. Hershey, Arnaud Doucet, Henry Li
Abstract: We consider the problem of single-channel audio source separation with the goal of reconstructing $K$ sources from their mixture. We address this ill-posed problem with FLOSS (FLOw matching for Source Separation), a constrained generation method based on flow matching, ensuring strict mixture consistency. Flow matching is a general methodology that, when given samples from two probability distributions defined on the same space, learns an ordinary differential equation to output a sample from one of the distributions when provided with a sample from the other. In our context, we have access to samples from the joint distribution of $K$ sources and so the corresponding samples from the lower-dimensional distribution of their mixture. To apply flow matching, we augment these mixture samples with artificial noise components to ensure the resulting "augmented" distribution matches the dimensionality of the $K$ source distribution. Additionally, as any permutation of the sources yields the same mixture, we adopt an equivariant formulation of flow matching which relies on a suitable custom-designed neural network architecture. We demonstrate the performance of the method for the separation of overlapping speech.

Title: Selective Invocation for Multilingual ASR: A Cost-effective Approach Adapting to Speech Recognition Difficulty
Authors: Hongfei Xue, Yufeng Tang, Jun Zhang, Xuelong Geng, Lei Xie
Abstract: Although multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have significantly advanced, enabling a single model to handle multiple languages, inherent linguistic differences and data imbalances challenge SOTA performance across all languages. While language identification (LID) models can route speech to the appropriate ASR model, they incur high costs from invoking SOTA commercial models and suffer from inaccuracies due to misclassification. To overcome these, we propose SIMA, a selective invocation for multilingual ASR that adapts to the difficulty level of the input speech. Built on a spoken large language model (SLLM), SIMA evaluates whether the input is simple enough for direct transcription or requires the invocation of a SOTA ASR model. Our approach reduces word error rates by 18.7% compared to the SLLM and halves invocation costs compared to LID-based methods. Tests on three datasets show that SIMA is a scalable, cost-effective solution for multilingual ASR applications.

Title: Discrete Tokens Exhibit Interlanguage Speech Intelligibility Benefit: an Analytical Study Towards Accent-robust ASR Only with Native Speech Data
Authors: Kentaro Onda, Keisuke Imoto, Satoru Fukayama, Daisuke Saito, Nobuaki Minematsu
Abstract: In this study, we gained insight that contributes to achieving accent-robust ASR using only native speech data. In human perception of non-native speech, the phenomenon known as "interlanguage speech intelligibility benefit" (ISIB) is observed, where non-native listeners who share the native language with the speaker understand the speech better compared even to native listeners. Based on the idea that discrete tokens extracted from self-supervised learning (SSL) models represent the human perception of speech, we conducted an analytical study on the robustness of discrete token-based ASR to non-native speech, varying the language used for training the tokenization, which is viewed as a technical implementation of ISIB. The results showed that ISIB actually occurred in the discrete token-based ASR. Since our approach relies only on native speech data to simulate the behavior of human perception, it is expected to be applicable to a wide range of accents for which speech data is scarce.

Title: Prosodically Enhanced Foreign Accent Simulation by Discrete Token-based Resynthesis Only with Native Speech Corpora
Authors: Kentaro Onda, Keisuke Imoto, Satoru Fukayama, Daisuke Saito, Nobuaki Minematsu
Abstract: Recently, a method for synthesizing foreign-accented speech only with native speech data using discrete tokens obtained from self-supervised learning (SSL) models was proposed. Considering limited availability of accented speech data, this method is expected to make it much easier to simulate foreign accents. By using the synthesized accented speech as listening materials for humans or training data for automatic speech recognition (ASR), both of them will acquire higher robustness against foreign accents. However, the previous method has a fatal flaw that it cannot reproduce duration-related accents. Durational accents are commonly seen when L2 speakers, whose native language has syllable-timed or mora-timed rhythm, speak stress-timed languages, such as English. In this paper, we integrate duration modification to the previous method to simulate foreign accents more accurately. Experiments show that the proposed method successfully replicates durational accents seen in real L2 speech.

Title: SpecMaskFoley: Steering Pretrained Spectral Masked Generative Transformer Toward Synchronized Video-to-audio Synthesis via ControlNet
Authors: Zhi Zhong, Akira Takahashi, Shuyang Cui, Keisuke Toyama, Shusuke Takahashi, Yuki Mitsufuji
Abstract: Foley synthesis aims to synthesize high-quality audio that is both semantically and temporally aligned with video frames. Given its broad application in creative industries, the task has gained increasing attention in the research community. To avoid the non-trivial task of training audio generative models from scratch, adapting pretrained audio generative models for video-synchronized foley synthesis presents an attractive direction. ControlNet, a method for adding fine-grained controls to pretrained generative models, has been applied to foley synthesis, but its use has been limited to handcrafted human-readable temporal conditions. In contrast, from-scratch models achieved success by leveraging high-dimensional deep features extracted using pretrained video encoders. We have observed a performance gap between ControlNet-based and from-scratch foley models. To narrow this gap, we propose SpecMaskFoley, a method that steers the pretrained SpecMaskGIT model toward video-synchronized foley synthesis via ControlNet. To unlock the potential of a single ControlNet branch, we resolve the discrepancy between the temporal video features and the time-frequency nature of the pretrained SpecMaskGIT via a frequency-aware temporal feature aligner, eliminating the need for complicated conditioning mechanisms widely used in prior arts. Evaluations on a common foley synthesis benchmark demonstrate that SpecMaskFoley could even outperform strong from-scratch baselines, substantially advancing the development of ControlNet-based foley synthesis models.

Title: Differentiable K-means for Fully-optimized Discrete Token-based ASR
Authors: Kentaro Onda, Yosuke Kashiwagi, Emiru Tsunoo, Hayato Futami, Shinji Watanabe
Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the potential of discrete tokens derived from self-supervised learning (SSL) models for various speech-related tasks. These tokens serve not only as substitutes for text in language modeling but also as intermediate representations for tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, discrete tokens are typically obtained via k-means clustering of SSL features independently of downstream tasks, making them suboptimal for specific applications. This paper proposes the use of differentiable k-means, enabling the joint optimization of tokenization and downstream tasks. This approach enables the fine-tuning of the SSL parameters and learning weights for outputs from multiple SSL layers. Experiments were conducted with ASR as a downstream task. ASR accuracy successfully improved owing to the optimized tokens. The acquired tokens also exhibited greater purity of phonetic information, which were found to be useful even in speech resynthesis.

Title: AudioTrust: Benchmarking the Multifaceted Trustworthiness of Audio Large Language Models

Abstract: The rapid advancement and expanding applications of Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs) demand a rigorous understanding of their trustworthiness. However, systematic research on evaluating these models, particularly concerning risks unique to the audio modality, remains largely unexplored. Existing evaluation frameworks primarily focus on the text modality or address only a restricted set of safety dimensions, failing to adequately account for the unique characteristics and application scenarios inherent to the audio modality. We introduce AudioTrust-the first multifaceted trustworthiness evaluation framework and benchmark specifically designed for ALLMs. AudioTrust facilitates assessments across six key dimensions: fairness, hallucination, safety, privacy, robustness, and authentication. To comprehensively evaluate these dimensions, AudioTrust is structured around 18 distinct experimental setups. Its core is a meticulously constructed dataset of over 4,420 audio/text samples, drawn from real-world scenarios (e.g., daily conversations, emergency calls, voice assistant interactions), specifically designed to probe the multifaceted trustworthiness of ALLMs. For assessment, the benchmark carefully designs 9 audio-specific evaluation metrics, and we employ a large-scale automated pipeline for objective and scalable scoring of model outputs. Experimental results reveal the trustworthiness boundaries and limitations of current state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source ALLMs when confronted with various high-risk audio scenarios, offering valuable insights for the secure and trustworthy deployment of future audio models. Our platform and benchmark are available at this https URL.

Title: Large Language Models based ASR Error Correction for Child Conversations
Authors: Anfeng Xu, Tiantian Feng, So Hyun Kim, Somer Bishop, Catherine Lord, Shrikanth Narayanan
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has recently shown remarkable progress, but accurately transcribing children's speech remains a significant challenge. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in improving ASR transcriptions. However, their applications in child speech including conversational scenarios are underexplored. In this study, we explore the use of LLMs in correcting ASR errors for conversational child speech. We demonstrate the promises and challenges of LLMs through experiments on two children's conversational speech datasets with both zero-shot and fine-tuned ASR outputs. We find that while LLMs are helpful in correcting zero-shot ASR outputs and fine-tuned CTC-based ASR outputs, it remains challenging for LLMs to improve ASR performance when incorporating contextual information or when using fine-tuned autoregressive ASR (e.g., Whisper) outputs.

Title: Beyond Diagonal Intelligent Reflecting Surface Aided Integrated Sensing and Communication
Authors: Shuo Zheng, Shuowen Zhang
Abstract: Beyond diagonal intelligent reflecting surface (BD-IRS) is a new promising IRS architecture for which the reflection matrix is not limited to the diagonal structure as for conventional IRS. In this paper, we study a BD-IRS aided uplink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system where sensing is performed in a device-based manner. Specifically, we aim to estimate the unknown and random location of an active target based on its uplink probing signals sent to a multi-antenna base station (BS) as well as the known prior distribution information of the target's location. Multiple communication users also simultaneously send uplink signals, resulting in a challenging mutual interference issue between sensing and communication. We first characterize the sensing performance metric by deriving the posterior Cramér-Rao bound (PCRB) of the mean-squared error (MSE) when prior information is available. Then, we formulate a BD-IRS reflection matrix optimization problem to maximize the minimum expected achievable rate among the multiple users subject to a constraint on the PCRB as well as the lossless and reciprocal constraints on the BD-IRS reflection matrix. The formulated problem is non-convex and challenging to solve. To tackle this problem, we propose a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) based algorithm which can find a high-quality suboptimal solution with polynomial-time complexity. In addition, we propose and optimize a time-division multiple access (TDMA) based scheme which removes the sensing-communication mutual interference. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed designs and provide useful design insights.

Title: Base Station Placement Optimization for Networked Sensing Exploiting Target Location Distribution
Authors: Kaiyue Hou, Shuowen Zhang
Abstract: This paper studies a networked sensing system with multiple base stations (BSs), which collaboratively sense the unknown and random three-dimensional (3D) location of a target based on the target-reflected echo signals received at the BSs. Considering a practical scenario where the target location distribution is known a priori for exploitation, we aim to design the placement of the multiple BSs to optimize the networked sensing performance. Firstly, we characterize the posterior Cramér-Rao bound (PCRB) of the mean-squared error (MSE) in sensing the target's 3D location. Despite its complex form under networked sensing, we derive its closed-form expression in terms of the BS locations. Next, we formulate the BS placement optimization problem to minimize the sensing PCRB, which is non-convex and difficult to solve. By leveraging a series of equivalent transformations and the iterative inner approximation method, we devise an algorithm with polynomial-time complexity which is guaranteed to converge to a solution satisfying the Karush-Kuhn Tucker (KKT) conditions of the problem. Numerical results show that the proposed placement design significantly outperforms various benchmark designs.

Title: Offline Guarded Safe Reinforcement Learning for Medical Treatment Optimization Strategies
Authors: Runze Yan, Xun Shen, Akifumi Wachi, Sebastien Gros, Anni Zhao, Xiao Hu
Abstract: When applying offline reinforcement learning (RL) in healthcare scenarios, the out-of-distribution (OOD) issues pose significant risks, as inappropriate generalization beyond clinical expertise can result in potentially harmful recommendations. While existing methods like conservative Q-learning (CQL) attempt to address the OOD issue, their effectiveness is limited by only constraining action selection by suppressing uncertain actions. This action-only regularization imitates clinician actions that prioritize short-term rewards, but it fails to regulate downstream state trajectories, thereby limiting the discovery of improved long-term treatment strategies. To safely improve policy beyond clinician recommendations while ensuring that state-action trajectories remain in-distribution, we propose \textit{Offline Guarded Safe Reinforcement Learning} ($\mathsf{OGSRL}$), a theoretically grounded model-based offline RL framework. $\mathsf{OGSRL}$ introduces a novel dual constraint mechanism for improving policy with reliability and safety. First, the OOD guardian is established to specify clinically validated regions for safe policy exploration. By constraining optimization within these regions, it enables the reliable exploration of treatment strategies that outperform clinician behavior by leveraging the full patient state history, without drifting into unsupported state-action trajectories. Second, we introduce a safety cost constraint that encodes medical knowledge about physiological safety boundaries, providing domain-specific safeguards even in areas where training data might contain potentially unsafe interventions. Notably, we provide theoretical guarantees on safety and near-optimality: policies that satisfy these constraints remain in safe and reliable regions and achieve performance close to the best possible policy supported by the data.

Title: Covariance matrix estimation in the singular case using regularized Cholesky factor
Authors: Olivier Besson
Abstract: We consider estimating the population covariance matrix when the number of available samples is less than the size of the observations. The sample covariance matrix (SCM) being singular, regularization is mandatory in this case. For this purpose we consider minimizing Stein's loss function and we investigate a method based on augmenting the partial Cholesky decomposition of the SCM. We first derive the finite sample optimum estimator which minimizes the loss for each data realization, then the Oracle estimator which minimizes the risk, i.e., the average value of the loss. Finally a practical scheme is presented where the missing part of the Cholesky decomposition is filled. We conduct a numerical performance study of the proposed method and compare it with available related methods. In particular we investigate the influence of the condition number of the covariance matrix as well as of the shape of its spectrum.

Title: Large-Scale Bayesian Tensor Reconstruction: An Approximate Message Passing Solution
Authors: Bingyang Cheng, Zhongtao Chen, Yichen Jin, Hao Zhang, Chen Zhang, Edmud Y. Lam, Yik-Chung Wu
Abstract: Tensor CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition (CPD) is a fundamental model for tensor reconstruction. Although the Bayesian framework allows for principled uncertainty quantification and automatic hyperparameter learning, existing methods do not scale well for large tensors because of high-dimensional matrix inversions. To this end, we introduce CP-GAMP, a scalable Bayesian CPD algorithm. This algorithm leverages generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) to avoid matrix inversions and incorporates an expectation-maximization routine to jointly infer the tensor rank and noise power. Through multiple experiments, for synthetic 100x100x100 rank 20 tensors with only 20% elements observed, the proposed algorithm reduces runtime by 82.7% compared to the state-of-the-art variational Bayesian CPD method, while maintaining comparable reconstruction accuracy.

Title: Paired and Unpaired Image to Image Translation using Generative Adversarial Networks
Authors: Gaurav Kumar, Soham Satyadharma, Harpreet Singh
Abstract: Image to image translation is an active area of research in the field of computer vision, enabling the generation of new images with different styles, textures, or resolutions while preserving their characteristic properties. Recent architectures leverage Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to transform input images from one domain to another. In this work, we focus on the study of both paired and unpaired image translation across multiple image domains. For the paired task, we used a conditional GAN model, and for the unpaired task, we trained it using cycle consistency loss. We experimented with different types of loss functions, multiple Patch-GAN sizes, and model architectures. New quantitative metrics - precision, recall, and FID score - were used for analysis. In addition, a qualitative study of the results of different experiments was conducted.

Title: SuperPure: Efficient Purification of Localized and Distributed Adversarial Patches via Super-Resolution GAN Models
Authors: Hossein Khalili, Seongbin Park, Venkat Bollapragada, Nader Sehatbakhsh
Abstract: As vision-based machine learning models are increasingly integrated into autonomous and cyber-physical systems, concerns about (physical) adversarial patch attacks are growing. While state-of-the-art defenses can achieve certified robustness with minimal impact on utility against highly-concentrated localized patch attacks, they fall short in two important areas: (i) State-of-the-art methods are vulnerable to low-noise distributed patches where perturbations are subtly dispersed to evade detection or masking, as shown recently by the DorPatch attack; (ii) Achieving high robustness with state-of-the-art methods is extremely time and resource-consuming, rendering them impractical for latency-sensitive applications in many cyber-physical systems. To address both robustness and latency issues, this paper proposes a new defense strategy for adversarial patch attacks called SuperPure. The key novelty is developing a pixel-wise masking scheme that is robust against both distributed and localized patches. The masking involves leveraging a GAN-based super-resolution scheme to gradually purify the image from adversarial patches. Our extensive evaluations using ImageNet and two standard classifiers, ResNet and EfficientNet, show that SuperPure advances the state-of-the-art in three major directions: (i) it improves the robustness against conventional localized patches by more than 20%, on average, while also improving top-1 clean accuracy by almost 10%; (ii) It achieves 58% robustness against distributed patch attacks (as opposed to 0% in state-of-the-art method, PatchCleanser); (iii) It decreases the defense end-to-end latency by over 98% compared to PatchCleanser. Our further analysis shows that SuperPure is robust against white-box attacks and different patch sizes. Our code is open-source.

Title: Cooperative NOMA Meets Emerging Technologies: A Survey for Next-Generation Wireless Networks
Authors: Mahmoud M. Salim, Suhail I. Al-Dharrab, Daniel Benevides Da Costa, Ali H. Muqaibel
Abstract: The emerging demands of sixth-generation wireless networks, such as ultra-connectivity, native intelligence, and cross-domain convergence, are bringing renewed focus to cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (C-NOMA) as a fundamental enabler of scalable, efficient, and intelligent communication systems. C-NOMA builds on the core benefits of NOMA by leveraging user cooperation and relay strategies to enhance spectral efficiency, coverage, and energy performance. This article presents a unified and forward-looking survey on the integration of C-NOMA with key enabling technologies, including radio frequency energy harvesting, cognitive radio networks, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, space-air-ground integrated networks, and integrated sensing and communication-assisted semantic communication. Foundational principles and relaying protocols are first introduced to establish the technical relevance of C-NOMA. Then, a focused investigation is conducted into protocol-level synergies, architectural models, and deployment strategies across these technologies. Beyond integration, this article emphasizes the orchestration of C-NOMA across future application domains such as digital twins, extended reality, and e-health. In addition, it provides an extensive and in-depth review of recent literature, categorized by relaying schemes, system models, performance metrics, and optimization paradigms, including model-based, heuristic, and AI-driven approaches. Finally, open challenges and future research directions are outlined, spanning standardization, security, and cross-layer design, positioning C-NOMA as a key pillar of intelligent next-generation network architectures.

Title: Performance Guaranteed Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning: A Sliding Mode Approach
Authors: Huazi Pan, Yanjun Zhang, Leo Yu Zhang, Scott Adams, Abbas Kouzani, Suiyang Khoo
Abstract: Manipulation of local training data and local updates, i.e., the poisoning attack, is the main threat arising from the collaborative nature of the federated learning (FL) paradigm. Most existing poisoning attacks aim to manipulate local data/models in a way that causes denial-of-service (DoS) issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel attack method, named Federated Learning Sliding Attack (FedSA) scheme, aiming at precisely introducing the extent of poisoning in a subtle controlled manner. It operates with a predefined objective, such as reducing global model's prediction accuracy by 10\%. FedSA integrates robust nonlinear control-Sliding Mode Control (SMC) theory with model poisoning attacks. It can manipulate the updates from malicious clients to drive the global model towards a compromised state, achieving this at a controlled and inconspicuous rate. Additionally, leveraging the robust control properties of FedSA allows precise control over the convergence bounds, enabling the attacker to set the global accuracy of the poisoned model to any desired level. Experimental results demonstrate that FedSA can accurately achieve a predefined global accuracy with fewer malicious clients while maintaining a high level of stealth and adjustable learning rates.

Title: On the reliability of feature attribution methods for speech classification
Authors: Gaofei Shen, Hosein Mohebbi, Arianna Bisazza, Afra Alishahi, Grzegorz Chrupała
Abstract: As the capabilities of large-scale pre-trained models evolve, understanding the determinants of their outputs becomes more important. Feature attribution aims to reveal which parts of the input elements contribute the most to model outputs. In speech processing, the unique characteristics of the input signal make the application of feature attribution methods challenging. We study how factors such as input type and aggregation and perturbation timespan impact the reliability of standard feature attribution methods, and how these factors interact with characteristics of each classification task. We find that standard approaches to feature attribution are generally unreliable when applied to the speech domain, with the exception of word-aligned perturbation methods when applied to word-based classification tasks.

Abstract: Pose-invariant face recognition has become a challenging problem for modern AI-based face recognition systems. It aims at matching a profile face captured in the wild with a frontal face registered in a database. Existing methods perform face frontalization via either generative models or learning a pose robust feature representation. In this paper, a new method is presented to perform face frontalization and recognition within the feature space. First, a novel feature space pose frontalization module (FSPFM) is proposed to transform profile images with arbitrary angles into frontal counterparts. Second, a new training paradigm is proposed to maximize the potential of FSPFM and boost its performance. The latter consists of a pre-training and an attention-guided fine-tuning stage. Moreover, extensive experiments have been conducted on five popular face recognition benchmarks. Results show that not only our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in the pose-invariant face recognition task but also maintains superior performance in other standard scenarios.

Authors: Qu He, Weikun Li, Guangmin Dai, Hao Chen, Qimeng Liu, Xiaoqing Tian, Jie You, Weicheng Cui, Michael S. Triantafyllou, Dixia Fan
Abstract: Fish have endured millions of years of evolution, and their distinct rigid-flexible body structures offer inspiration for overcoming challenges in underwater robotics, such as limited mobility, high energy consumption, and adaptability. This paper introduces SpineWave, a biomimetic robotic fish featuring a fish-spine-like rigid-flexible transition structure. The structure integrates expandable fishbone-like ribs and adjustable magnets, mimicking the stretch and recoil of fish muscles to balance rigidity and flexibility. In addition, we employed an evolutionary algorithm to optimize the hydrodynamics of the robot, achieving significant improvements in swimming performance. Real-world tests demonstrated robustness and potential for environmental monitoring, underwater exploration, and industrial inspection. These tests established SpineWave as a transformative platform for aquatic robotics.

Title: Monitoring Electrostatic Adhesion Forces via Acoustic Pressure
Authors: Huacen Wang, Jiarui Zou, Zeju Zheng, Hongqiang Wang
Abstract: Electrostatic adhesion is widely used in mobile robotics, haptics, and robotic end effectors for its adaptability to diverse substrates and low energy consumption. Force sensing is important for feedback control, interaction, and monitoring in the EA system. However, EA force monitoring often relies on bulky and expensive sensors, increasing the complexity and weight of the entire system. This paper presents an acoustic-pressure-based method to monitor EA forces without contacting the adhesion pad. When the EA pad is driven by a bipolar square-wave voltage to adhere a conductive object, periodic acoustic pulses arise from the EA system. We employed a microphone to capture these acoustic pressure signals and investigate the influence of peak pressure values. Results show that the peak value of acoustic pressure increased with the mass and contact area of the adhered object, as well as with the amplitude and frequency of the driving voltage. We applied this technique to mass estimation of various objects and simultaneous monitoring of two EA systems. Then, we integrated this technique into an EA end effector that enables monitoring the change of adhered object mass during transport. The proposed technique offers a low-cost, non-contact, and multi-object monitoring solution for EA end effectors in handling tasks.

Title: Unsupervised Network Anomaly Detection with Autoencoders and Traffic Images
Authors: Michael Neri, Sara Baldoni
Abstract: Due to the recent increase in the number of connected devices, the need to promptly detect security issues is emerging. Moreover, the high number of communication flows creates the necessity of processing huge amounts of data. Furthermore, the connected devices are heterogeneous in nature, having different computational capacities. For this reason, in this work we propose an image-based representation of network traffic which allows to realize a compact summary of the current network conditions with 1-second time windows. The proposed representation highlights the presence of anomalies thus reducing the need for complex processing architectures. Finally, we present an unsupervised learning approach which effectively detects the presence of anomalies. The code and the dataset are available at this https URL.

Title: Zero-Shot Hyperspectral Pansharpening Using Hysteresis-Based Tuning for Spectral Quality Control
Authors: Giuseppe Guarino, Matteo Ciotola, Gemine Vivone, Giovanni Poggi, Giuseppe Scarpa
Abstract: Hyperspectral pansharpening has received much attention in recent years due to technological and methodological advances that open the door to new application scenarios. However, research on this topic is only now gaining momentum. The most popular methods are still borrowed from the more mature field of multispectral pansharpening and often overlook the unique challenges posed by hyperspectral data fusion, such as i) the very large number of bands, ii) the overwhelming noise in selected spectral ranges, iii) the significant spectral mismatch between panchromatic and hyperspectral components, iv) a typically high resolution ratio. Imprecise data modeling especially affects spectral fidelity. Even state-of-the-art methods perform well in certain spectral ranges and much worse in others, failing to ensure consistent quality across all bands, with the risk of generating unreliable results. Here, we propose a hyperspectral pansharpening method that explicitly addresses this problem and ensures uniform spectral quality. To this end, a single lightweight neural network is used, with weights that adapt on the fly to each band. During fine-tuning, the spatial loss is turned on and off to ensure a fast convergence of the spectral loss to the desired level, according to a hysteresis-like dynamic. Furthermore, the spatial loss itself is appropriately redefined to account for nonlinear dependencies between panchromatic and spectral bands. Overall, the proposed method is fully unsupervised, with no prior training on external data, flexible, and low-complexity. Experiments on a recently published benchmarking toolbox show that it ensures excellent sharpening quality, competitive with the state-of-the-art, consistently across all bands. The software code and the full set of results are shared online on this https URL.

Title: Joint Magnetometer-IMU Calibration via Maximum A Posteriori Estimation
Authors: Chuan Huang, Gustaf Hendeby, Isaac Skog
Abstract: This paper presents a new approach for jointly calibrating magnetometers and inertial measurement units, focusing on improving calibration accuracy and computational efficiency. The proposed method formulates the calibration problem as a maximum a posteriori estimation problem, treating both the calibration parameters and orientation trajectory of the sensors as unknowns. This formulation enables efficient optimization with closed-form derivatives. The method is compared against two state-of-the-art approaches in terms of computational complexity and estimation accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves lower root mean square error in calibration parameters while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. Further validation through real-world experiments confirms the practical benefits of our approach: it effectively reduces position drift in a magnetic field-aided inertial navigation system by more than a factor of two on most datasets. Moreover, the proposed method calibrated 30 magnetometers in less than 2 minutes. The contributions include a new calibration method, an analysis of existing methods, and a comprehensive empirical evaluation. Datasets and algorithms are made publicly available to promote reproducible research.

Title: MEbots: Integrating a RISC-V Virtual Platform with a Robotic Simulator for Energy-aware Design
Authors: Giovanni Pollo, Mohamed Amine Hamdi, Matteo Risso, Lorenzo Ruotolo, Pietro Furbatto, Matteo Isoldi, Yukai Chen, Alessio Burrello, Enrico Macii, Massimo Poncino, Daniele Jahier Pagliari, Sara Vinco
Abstract: Virtual Platforms (VPs) enable early software validation of autonomous systems' electronics, reducing costs and time-to-market. While many VPs support both functional and non-functional simulation (e.g., timing, power), they lack the capability of simulating the environment in which the system operates. In contrast, robotics simulators lack accurate timing and power features. This twofold shortcoming limits the effectiveness of the design flow, as the designer can not fully evaluate the features of the solution under development. This paper presents a novel, fully open-source framework bridging this gap by integrating a robotics simulator (Webots) with a VP for RISC-V-based systems (MESSY). The framework enables a holistic, mission-level, energy-aware co-simulation of electronics in their surrounding environment, streamlining the exploration of design configurations and advanced power management policies.

Title: One-Step Diffusion-Based Image Compression with Semantic Distillation
Authors: Naifu Xue, Zhaoyang Jia, Jiahao Li, Bin Li, Yuan Zhang, Yan Lu
Abstract: While recent diffusion-based generative image codecs have shown impressive performance, their iterative sampling process introduces unpleasing latency. In this work, we revisit the design of a diffusion-based codec and argue that multi-step sampling is not necessary for generative compression. Based on this insight, we propose OneDC, a One-step Diffusion-based generative image Codec -- that integrates a latent compression module with a one-step diffusion generator. Recognizing the critical role of semantic guidance in one-step diffusion, we propose using the hyperprior as a semantic signal, overcoming the limitations of text prompts in representing complex visual content. To further enhance the semantic capability of the hyperprior, we introduce a semantic distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge from a pretrained generative tokenizer to the hyperprior codec. Additionally, we adopt a hybrid pixel- and latent-domain optimization to jointly enhance both reconstruction fidelity and perceptual realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OneDC achieves SOTA perceptual quality even with one-step generation, offering over 40% bitrate reduction and 20x faster decoding compared to prior multi-step diffusion-based codecs. Code will be released later.

Title: SEDD-PCC: A Single Encoder-Dual Decoder Framework For End-To-End Learned Point Cloud Compression
Authors: Kai Hsiang Hsieh, Monyneath Yim, Jui Chiu Chiang
Abstract: To encode point clouds containing both geometry and attributes, most learning-based compression schemes treat geometry and attribute coding separately, employing distinct encoders and decoders. This not only increases computational complexity but also fails to fully exploit shared features between geometry and attributes. To address this limitation, we propose SEDD-PCC, an end-to-end learning-based framework for lossy point cloud compression that jointly compresses geometry and attributes. SEDD-PCC employs a single encoder to extract shared geometric and attribute features into a unified latent space, followed by dual specialized decoders that sequentially reconstruct geometry and attributes. Additionally, we incorporate knowledge distillation to enhance feature representation learning from a teacher model, further improving coding efficiency. With its simple yet effective design, SEDD-PCC provides an efficient and practical solution for point cloud compression. Comparative evaluations against both rule-based and learning-based methods demonstrate its competitive performance, highlighting SEDD-PCC as a promising AI-driven compression approach.

Title: LLM-Based Emulation of the Radio Resource Control Layer: Towards AI-Native RAN Protocols
Authors: Ziming liu, Bryan Liu, Alvaro Valcarce, Xiaoli Chu
Abstract: Integrating large AI models (LAMs) into 6G mobile networks promises to redefine protocol design and control-plane intelligence by enabling autonomous, cognitive network operations. While industry concepts, such as ETSI's Experiential Networked Intelligence (ENI), envision LAM-driven agents for adaptive network slicing and intent-based management, practical implementations still face challenges in protocol literacy and real-world deployment. This paper presents an end-to-end demonstration of a LAM that generates standards-compliant, ASN.1-encoded Radio Resource Control (RRC) messages as part of control-plane procedures inside a gNB. We treat RRC messaging as a domain-specific language and fine-tune a decoder-only transformer model (LLaMA class) using parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on RRC messages linearized to retain their ASN.1 syntactic structure before standard byte-pair encoding tokenization. This enables combinatorial generalization over RRC protocol states while minimizing training overhead. On 30k field-test request-response pairs, our 8 B model achieves a median cosine similarity of 0.97 with ground-truth messages on an edge GPU -- a 61 % relative gain over a zero-shot LLaMA-3 8B baseline -- indicating substantially improved structural and semantic RRC fidelity. Overall, our results show that LAMs, when augmented with Radio Access Network (RAN)-specific reasoning, can directly orchestrate control-plane procedures, representing a stepping stone toward the AI-native air-interface paradigm. Beyond RRC emulation, this work lays the groundwork for future AI-native wireless standards.

Title: Including the magnitude variability of a signal into the ordinal pattern analysis
Authors: Melvyn Tyloo, Joaquín González, Nicolás Rubido
Abstract: One of the most popular and innovative methods to analyse signals is by using Ordinal Patterns (OPs). The OP encoding is based on transforming a (univariate) signal into a symbolic sequence of OPs, where each OP represents the number of permutations needed to order a small subset of the signal's magnitudes. This implies that OPs are conceptually clear, methodologically simple to implement, robust to noise, and can be applied to short signals. Moreover, they simplify the statistical analyses that can be carried out on a signal, such as entropy and complexity quantifications. However, because of the relative ordering, information about the magnitude of the signal at each timestamp is lost -- this being one of the major drawbacks in the method. Here, we propose a way to use the signal magnitudes discarded in the OP encoding as a complementary variable to its permutation entropy. To illustrate our approach, we analyse synthetic trajectories from logistic and H{é}non maps -- with and without added noise -- and intracranial electroencephalographic recordings from rats in different sleep-wake states. Our results show that, when complementing the permutation entropy with the variability in the signal magnitudes, the characterisation of the dynamical behaviours of the maps and the sleep-wake states is improved. This implies that our approach can be useful for feature engineering and improving AI classifiers, where typical machine learning algorithms need complementary signal features as inputs to improve classification accuracy.

Title: From Tens of Hours to Tens of Thousands: Scaling Back-Translation for Speech Recognition
Authors: Tianduo Wang, Lu Xu, Wei Lu, Shanbo Cheng
Abstract: Recent advances in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) have been largely fueled by massive speech corpora. However, extending coverage to diverse languages with limited resources remains a formidable challenge. This paper introduces Speech Back-Translation, a scalable pipeline that improves multilingual ASR models by converting large-scale text corpora into synthetic speech via off-the-shelf text-to-speech (TTS) models. We demonstrate that just tens of hours of real transcribed speech can effectively train TTS models to generate synthetic speech at hundreds of times the original volume while maintaining high quality. To evaluate synthetic speech quality, we develop an intelligibility-based assessment framework and establish clear thresholds for when synthetic data benefits ASR training. Using Speech Back-Translation, we generate more than 500,000 hours of synthetic speech in ten languages and continue pre-training Whisper-large-v3, achieving average transcription error reductions of over 30\%. These results highlight the scalability and effectiveness of Speech Back-Translation for enhancing multilingual ASR systems.

Title: Deep mineralogical segmentation of thin section images based on QEMSCAN maps
Authors: Jean Pablo Vieira de Mello, Matheus Augusto Alves Cuglieri, Leandro P. de Figueiredo, Fernando Bordignon, Marcelo Ramalho Albuquerque, Rodrigo Surmas, Bruno Cavalcanti de Paula
Abstract: Interpreting the mineralogical aspects of rock thin sections is an important task for oil and gas reservoirs evaluation. However, human analysis tend to be subjective and laborious. Technologies like QEMSCAN(R) are designed to automate the mineralogical mapping process, but also suffer from limitations like high monetary costs and time-consuming analysis. This work proposes a Convolutional Neural Network model for automatic mineralogical segmentation of thin section images of carbonate rocks. The model is able to mimic the QEMSCAN mapping itself in a low-cost, generalized and efficient manner. For this, the U-Net semantic segmentation architecture is trained on plane and cross polarized thin section images using the corresponding QEMSCAN maps as target, which is an approach not widely explored. The model was instructed to differentiate occurrences of Calcite, Dolomite, Mg-Clay Minerals, Quartz, Pores and the remaining mineral phases as an unique class named "Others", while it was validated on rock facies both seen and unseen during training, in order to address its generalization capability. Since the images and maps are provided in different resolutions, image registration was applied to align then spatially. The study reveals that the quality of the segmentation is very much dependent on these resolution differences and on the variety of learnable rock textures. However, it shows promising results, especially with regard to the proper delineation of minerals boundaries on solid textures and precise estimation of the minerals distributions, describing a nearly linear relationship between expected and predicted distributions, with coefficient of determination (R^2) superior to 0.97 for seen facies and 0.88 for unseen.

Title: Deep Koopman Learning using Noisy Data
Authors: Wenjian Hao, Devesh Upadhyay, Shaoshuai Mou
Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven framework to learn a finite-dimensional approximation of a Koopman operator for approximating the state evolution of a dynamical system under noisy observations. To this end, our proposed solution has two main advantages. First, the proposed method only requires the measurement noise to be bounded. Second, the proposed method modifies the existing deep Koopman operator formulations by characterizing the effect of the measurement noise on the Koopman operator learning and then mitigating it by updating the tunable parameter of the observable functions of the Koopman operator, making it easy to implement. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on several standard benchmarks. We then compare the presented method with similar methods proposed in the latest literature on Koopman learning.

Title: Distribution System Reconfiguration to Mitigate Load Altering Attacks via Stackelberg Games
Authors: Sajjad Maleki, E. Veronica Belmaga, Charalambos Konstantinou, Subhash Lakshminarayana
Abstract: The integration of IoT-controllable devices in power systems (such as smart electric vehicle charging stations, heat pumps, etc.), despite their benefits, raises novel cybersecurity concerns. Vulnerabilities in these devices can be leveraged to launch load-altering attacks (LAAs) that can potentially compromise the safety of power systems. In this paper, we analyze the impact of LAAs on the voltage profile of distribution networks (DNs). We first derive closed-form expressions to quantify the attacks' impact. Using the insights derived from this analysis, we then propose a reactive defense method to mitigate LAAs based on reconfiguring the DNs. We also study optimal defense strategies that are robust to LAAs by exploiting non-cooperative sequential game theory. The proposed solution takes into account the potential uncertainties in the attack localization. Furthermore, we propose a Bayesian optimization (BO) approach to compute the equilibrium of the game, which reduces the computational burden. Our results show that attacks launched on the deepest nodes in the DN have the most detrimental effect on the grid voltage profile. Furthermore, the proposed game-theoretic strategy successfully mitigates the effect of the attack while ensuring minimum system reconfiguration.

Title: ShiftySpeech: A Large-Scale Synthetic Speech Dataset with Distribution Shifts
Authors: Ashi Garg, Zexin Cai, Lin Zhang, Henry Li Xinyuan, Leibny Paola García-Perera, Kevin Duh, Sanjeev Khudanpur, Matthew Wiesner, Nicholas Andrews
Abstract: The problem of synthetic speech detection has enjoyed considerable attention, with recent methods achieving low error rates across several established benchmarks. However, to what extent can low error rates on academic benchmarks translate to more realistic conditions? In practice, while the training set is fixed at one point in time, test-time conditions may exhibit distribution shifts relative to the training conditions, such as changes in speaker characteristics, emotional expressiveness, language and acoustic conditions, and the emergence of novel synthesis methods. Although some existing datasets target subsets of these distribution shifts, systematic analysis remains difficult due to inconsistencies between source data and synthesis systems across datasets. This difficulty is further exacerbated by the rapid development of new text-to-speech (TTS) and vocoder systems, which continually expand the diversity of synthetic speech. To enable systematic benchmarking of model performance under distribution shifts, we introduce ShiftySpeech, a large-scale benchmark comprising over 3,000 hours of synthetic speech across 7 source domains, 6 TTS systems, 12 vocoders, and 3 languages. ShiftySpeech is specifically designed to evaluate model generalization under controlled distribution shifts while ensuring broad coverage of modern synthetic speech generation techniques. It fills a key gap in current benchmarks by supporting fine-grained, controlled analysis of generalization robustness. All tested distribution shifts significantly degrade detection performance of state-of-the-art detection approaches based on self-supervised features. Overall, our findings suggest that reliance on synthetic speech detection methods in production environments should be carefully evaluated based on anticipated distribution shifts.

Title: Liver Cirrhosis Stage Estimation from MRI with Deep Learning

Abstract: We present an end-to-end deep learning framework for automated liver cirrhosis stage estimation from multi-sequence MRI. Cirrhosis is the severe scarring (fibrosis) of the liver and a common endpoint of various chronic liver diseases. Early diagnosis is vital to prevent complications such as decompensation and cancer, which significantly decreases life expectancy. However, diagnosing cirrhosis in its early stages is challenging, and patients often present with life-threatening complications. Our approach integrates multi-scale feature learning with sequence-specific attention mechanisms to capture subtle tissue variations across cirrhosis progression stages. Using CirrMRI600+, a large-scale publicly available dataset of 628 high-resolution MRI scans from 339 patients, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in three-stage cirrhosis classification. Our best model achieves 72.8% accuracy on T1W and 63.8% on T2W sequences, significantly outperforming traditional radiomics-based approaches. Through extensive ablation studies, we show that our architecture effectively learns stage-specific imaging biomarkers. We establish new benchmarks for automated cirrhosis staging and provide insights for developing clinically applicable deep learning systems. The source code will be available at this https URL.

Title: Choose Wisely: Data-driven Predictive Control for Nonlinear Systems Using Online Data Selection
Authors: Joshua Näf, Keith Moffat, Jaap Eising, Florian Dörfler
Abstract: This paper proposes Select-Data-driven Predictive Control (Select-DPC), a new method for controlling nonlinear systems using output-feedback for which data are available but an explicit model is not. At each timestep, Select-DPC employs only the most relevant data to implicitly linearize the dynamics in "trajectory space". Then, taking user-defined output constraints into account, it makes control decisions using a convex optimization. This optimal control is applied in a receding-horizon manner. As the online data-selection is the core of Select-DPC, we propose and verify both norm-based and manifold-embedding-based selection methods. We evaluate Select-DPC on three benchmark nonlinear system simulators -- rocket-landing, a robotic arm and cart-pole inverted pendulum swing-up -- comparing them with standard Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) and Time-Windowed DeePC methods, and find that Select-DPC outperforms both methods.

Title: Physics-Informed Neural Network-Based Control for Grid-Forming Converter's Stability Under Overload Conditions
Authors: Abhay Kumar, Dushyant Sharma, Mayukha Pal
Abstract: Grid-forming converters (GFCs) are crucial for frequency and voltage stability in modern power systems. However, their performance under overload conditions remains a challenge. This paper highlights the limitations of existing approaches in managing DC source saturation and AC current limits, emphasizing the need for improved control strategies to ensure system stability. This paper proposes a control strategy based on a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to improve GFC performance under overloaded conditions, effectively preventing switch failures and mitigating DC source saturation. This approach outperforms conventional methods by maintaining stable voltage and frequency, even under significant load increase where traditional droop control alone proves inadequate. The post-disturbance operating point of GFCs remains unchanged using PINN-based control with an improvement of 0.245 Hz in frequency and 0.03 p.u. in active power when compared to an already existing current limitation strategy. Additionally, it reduces peak voltage deviations during transients by 24.14\%, lowers the rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) from 0.02 Hz/s to 0.005 Hz/s, and improves the rate of change of voltage (ROCOV), keeping both within acceptable limits. These improvements significantly enhance system resilience, especially in inertia-less power networks.

Title: A Hybrid Systems Model of Feedback Optimization for Linear Systems
Authors: Oscar Jed Chuy, Matthew Hale, Ricardo Sanfelice
Abstract: Feedback optimization algorithms compute inputs to a system in real time, which helps mitigate the effects of unknown disturbances. However, existing work models both system dynamics and computations in either discrete or continuous time, which does not faithfully model some applications. In this work, we model linear system dynamics in continuous time, and we model the computations of inputs in discrete time. Therefore, we present a novel hybrid systems framework for modeling feedback optimization of linear time-invariant systems that are subject to unknown, constant disturbances. For this setup, we first establish the well-posedness of the hybrid model and establish completeness of solutions while ruling out Zeno behavior. Then, our main result derives a convergence rate and an error bound for the full hybrid computation-in-theloop system and shows that it converges exponentially towards a ball of known radius about a desired fixed point. Simulation results show that this approach successfully mitigates the effects of disturbances, with the magnitude of steady-state error being 81% less than the magnitude of the disturbances in the system.

Title: Benchmarking Ophthalmology Foundation Models for Clinically Significant Age Macular Degeneration Detection
Authors: Benjamin A. Cohen, Jonathan Fhima, Meishar Meisel, Baskin Meital, Luis Filipe Nakayama, Eran Berkowitz, Joachim A. Behar
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has enabled Vision Transformers (ViTs) to learn robust representations from large-scale natural image datasets, enhancing their generalization across domains. In retinal imaging, foundation models pretrained on either natural or ophthalmic data have shown promise, but the benefits of in-domain pretraining remain uncertain. To investigate this, we benchmark six SSL-pretrained ViTs on seven digital fundus image (DFI) datasets totaling 70,000 expert-annotated images for the task of moderate-to-late age-related macular degeneration (AMD) identification. Our results show that iBOT pretrained on natural images achieves the highest out-of-distribution generalization, with AUROCs of 0.80-0.97, outperforming domain-specific models, which achieved AUROCs of 0.78-0.96 and a baseline ViT-L with no pretraining, which achieved AUROCs of 0.68-0.91. These findings highlight the value of foundation models in improving AMD identification and challenge the assumption that in-domain pretraining is necessary. Furthermore, we release BRAMD, an open-access dataset (n=587) of DFIs with AMD labels from Brazil.

Title: Regularized Model Predictive Control
Authors: Komeil Nosrati, Juri Belikov, Aleksei Tepljakov, Eduard Petlenkov
Abstract: In model predictive control (MPC), the choice of cost-weighting matrices and designing the Hessian matrix directly affects the trade-off between rapid state regulation and minimizing the control effort. However, traditional MPC in quadratic programming relies on fixed design matrices across the entire horizon, which can lead to suboptimal performance. This letter presents a Riccati equation-based method for adjusting the design matrix within the MPC framework, which enhances real-time performance. We employ a penalized least-squares (PLS) approach to derive a quadratic cost function for a discrete-time linear system over a finite prediction horizon. Using the method of weighting and enforcing the constraint equation by introducing a large penalty parameter, we solve the constrained optimization problem and generate control inputs for forward-shifted horizons. This process yields a recursive PLS-based Riccati equation that updates the design matrix as a regularization term in each shift, forming the foundation of the regularized MPC (Re-MPC) algorithm. To accomplish this, we provide a convergence and stability analysis of the developed algorithm. Numerical analysis demonstrates its superiority over traditional methods by allowing Riccati equation-based adjustments.

Title: Improving Noise Robustness of LLM-based Zero-shot TTS via Discrete Acoustic Token Denoising
Authors: Ye-Xin Lu, Hui-Peng Du, Fei Liu, Yang Ai, Zhen-Hua Ling
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) methods tend to preserve the acoustic environment of the audio prompt, leading to degradation in synthesized speech quality when the audio prompt contains noise. In this paper, we propose a novel neural codec-based speech denoiser and integrate it with the advanced LLM-based TTS model, LauraTTS, to achieve noise-robust zero-shot TTS. The proposed codec denoiser consists of an audio codec, a token denoiser, and an embedding refiner. The token denoiser predicts the first two groups of clean acoustic tokens from the noisy ones, which can serve as the acoustic prompt for LauraTTS to synthesize high-quality personalized speech or be converted to clean speech waveforms through the embedding refiner and codec decoder. Experimental results show that our proposed codec denoiser outperforms state-of-the-art speech enhancement (SE) methods, and the proposed noise-robust LauraTTS surpasses the approach using additional SE models.

Title: Optimal Control of Nonlinear Systems with Unknown Dynamics
Authors: Wenjian Hao, Paulo C. Heredia, Shaoshuai Mou
Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven method for finding a closed-loop optimal controller, which minimizes a specified infinite-horizon cost function for systems with unknown dynamics given any arbitrary initial state. Suppose the closed-loop optimal controller can be parameterized by a given class of functions, hereafter referred to as the policy. The proposed method introduces a novel gradient estimation framework, which approximates the gradient of the cost function with respect to the policy parameters via integrating the Koopman operator with the classical concept of actor-critic. This enables the policy parameters to be tuned iteratively using gradient descent to achieve an optimal controller, leveraging the linearity of the Koopman operator. The convergence analysis of the proposed framework is provided. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through comparisons with a model-free reinforcement learning approach, and its control performance is further evaluated through simulations against model-based optimal control methods that solve the same optimal control problem utilizing the exact system dynamics.

Title: A Deep Unrolling Model with Hybrid Optimization Structure for Hyperspectral Image Deconvolution
Authors: Alexandros Gkillas, Dimitris Ampeliotis, Kostas Berberidis
Abstract: In recent literature there are plenty of works that combine handcrafted and learnable regularizers to solve inverse imaging problems. While this hybrid approach has demonstrated promising results, the motivation for combining handcrafted and learnable regularizers remains largely underexplored. This work aims to justify this combination, by demonstrating that the incorporation of proper handcrafted regularizers alongside learnable regularizers not only reduces the complexity of the learnable prior, but also the performance is notably enhanced. To analyze the impact of this synergy, we introduce the notion of residual structure, to refer to the structure of the solution that cannot be modeled by the handcrafted regularizers per se. Motivated by these, we propose a novel optimization framework for the hyperspectral deconvolution problem, called DeepMix. Based on the proposed optimization framework, an interpretable model is developed using the deep unrolling strategy, which consists of three distinct modules, namely, a data consistency module, a module that enforces the effect of the handcrafted regularizers, and a denoising module. Recognizing the collaborative nature of these modules, this work proposes a context aware denoising module designed to sustain the advancements achieved by the cooperative efforts of the other modules. This is facilitated through the incorporation of a proper skip connection, ensuring that essential details and structures identified by other modules are effectively retained and not lost during denoising. Extensive experimental results across simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that DeepMix is notable for surpassing existing methodologies, offering marked improvements in both image quality and computational efficiency.

Title: Artificial intelligence in digital pathology: a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy
Authors: Clare McGenity, Emily L Clarke, Charlotte Jennings, Gillian Matthews, Caroline Cartlidge, Henschel Freduah-Agyemang, Deborah D Stocken, Darren Treanor
Abstract: Ensuring diagnostic performance of AI models before clinical use is key to the safe and successful adoption of these technologies. Studies reporting AI applied to digital pathology images for diagnostic purposes have rapidly increased in number in recent years. The aim of this work is to provide an overview of the diagnostic accuracy of AI in digital pathology images from all areas of pathology. This systematic review and meta-analysis included diagnostic accuracy studies using any type of artificial intelligence applied to whole slide images (WSIs) in any disease type. The reference standard was diagnosis through histopathological assessment and / or immunohistochemistry. Searches were conducted in PubMed, EMBASE and CENTRAL in June 2022. We identified 2976 studies, of which 100 were included in the review and 48 in the full meta-analysis. Risk of bias and concerns of applicability were assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Data extraction was conducted by two investigators and meta-analysis was performed using a bivariate random effects model. 100 studies were identified for inclusion, equating to over 152,000 whole slide images (WSIs) and representing many disease types. Of these, 48 studies were included in the meta-analysis. These studies reported a mean sensitivity of 96.3% (CI 94.1-97.7) and mean specificity of 93.3% (CI 90.5-95.4) for AI. There was substantial heterogeneity in study design and all 100 studies identified for inclusion had at least one area at high or unclear risk of bias. This review provides a broad overview of AI performance across applications in whole slide imaging. However, there is huge variability in study design and available performance data, with details around the conduct of the study and make up of the datasets frequently missing. Overall, AI offers good accuracy when applied to WSIs but requires more rigorous evaluation of its performance.

Title: Distributed alternating gradient descent for convex semi-infinite programs over a network
Authors: Ashwin Aravind, Debasish Chatterjee, Ashish Cherukuri
Abstract: This paper presents a first-order distributed algorithm for solving a convex semi-infinite program (SIP) over a time-varying network. In this setting, the objective function associated with the optimization problem is a summation of a set of functions, each held by one node in a network. The semi-infinite constraint, on the other hand, is known to all agents. The nodes collectively aim to solve the problem using local data about the objective and limited communication capabilities depending on the network topology. Our algorithm is built on three key ingredients: consensus step, gradient descent in the local objective, and local gradient descent iterations in the constraint at a node when the estimate violates the semi-infinite constraint. The algorithm is constructed, and its parameters are prescribed in such a way that the iterates held by each agent provably converge to an optimizer. That is, as the algorithm progresses, the estimates achieve consensus, and the constraint violation and the error in the optimal value are bounded above by vanishing terms. Simulation examples illustrate our results.

Title: Robo-Platform: A Robotic System for Recording Sensors and Controlling Robots
Authors: Masoud Dayani Najafabadi, Khoshnam Shojaei
Abstract: Mobile smartphones compactly provide sensors such as cameras, IMUs, GNSS measurement units, and wireless and wired communication channels required for robotics projects. They are affordable, portable, and programmable, which makes them ideal for testing, data acquisition, controlling mobile robots, and many other robotic applications. A robotic system is proposed in this paper, consisting of an Android phone, a microcontroller board attached to the phone via USB, and a remote wireless controller station. In the data acquisition mode, the Android device can record a dataset of a diverse configuration of multiple cameras, IMUs, GNSS units, and external USB ADC channels in the rawest format used for, but not limited to, pose estimation and scene reconstruction applications. In robot control mode, the Android phone, a microcontroller board, and other peripherals constitute the mobile or stationary robotic system. This system is controlled using a remote server connected over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Experiments show that although the SLAM and AR applications can utilize the acquired data, the proposed system can pave the way for more advanced algorithms for processing these noisy and sporadic measurements. Moreover, the characteristics of the communication media are studied, and two example robotic projects, which involve controlling a toy car and a quadcopter, are included.

Title: Long-Form Text-to-Music Generation with Adaptive Prompts: A Case Study in Tabletop Role-Playing Games Soundtracks
Authors: Felipe Marra, Lucas N. Ferreira
Abstract: This paper investigates the capabilities of text-to-audio music generation models in producing long-form music with prompts that change over time, focusing on soundtrack generation for Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TRPGs). We introduce Babel Bardo, a system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform speech transcriptions into music descriptions for controlling a text-to-music model. Four versions of Babel Bardo were compared in two TRPG campaigns: a baseline using direct speech transcriptions, and three LLM-based versions with varying approaches to music description generation. Evaluations considered audio quality, story alignment, and transition smoothness. Results indicate that detailed music descriptions improve audio quality while maintaining consistency across consecutive descriptions enhances story alignment and transition smoothness.

Title: Slamming: Training a Speech Language Model on One GPU in a Day
Authors: Gallil Maimon, Avishai Elmakies, Yossi Adi
Abstract: We introduce Slam, a recipe for training high-quality Speech Language Models (SLMs) on a single academic GPU in 24 hours. We do so through empirical analysis of model initialisation and architecture, synthetic training data, preference optimisation with synthetic data and tweaking all other components. We empirically demonstrate that this training recipe also scales well with more compute getting results on par with leading SLMs in a fraction of the compute cost. We hope these insights will make SLM training and research more accessible. In the context of SLM scaling laws, our results far outperform predicted compute optimal performance, giving an optimistic view to SLM feasibility.

Title: L2RDaS: Synthesizing 4D Radar Tensors for Model Generalization via Dataset Expansion
Authors: Woo-Jin Jung, Dong-Hee Paek, Seung-Hyun Kong
Abstract: 4-dimensional (4D) radar is increasingly adopted in autonomous driving for perception tasks, owing to its robustness under adverse weather conditions. To better utilize the spatial information inherent in 4D radar data, recent deep learning methods have transitioned from using sparse point cloud to 4D radar tensors. However, the scarcity of publicly available 4D radar tensor datasets limits model generalization across diverse driving scenarios. Previous methods addressed this by synthesizing radar data, but the outputs did not fully exploit the spatial information characteristic of 4D radar. To overcome these limitations, we propose LiDAR-to-4D radar data synthesis (L2RDaS), a framework that synthesizes spatially informative 4D radar tensors from LiDAR data available in existing autonomous driving datasets. L2RDaS integrates a modified U-Net architecture to effectively capture spatial information and an object information supplement (OBIS) module to enhance reflection fidelity. This framework enables the synthesis of radar tensors across diverse driving scenarios without additional sensor deployment or data collection. L2RDaS improves model generalization by expanding real datasets with synthetic radar tensors, achieving an average increase of 4.25\% in ${{AP}_{BEV}}$ and 2.87\% in ${{AP}_{3D}}$ across three detection models. Additionally, L2RDaS supports ground-truth augmentation (GT-Aug) by embedding annotated objects into LiDAR data and synthesizing them into radar tensors, resulting in further average increases of 3.75\% in ${{AP}_{BEV}}$ and 4.03\% in ${{AP}_{3D}}$. The implementation will be available at this https URL.

Title: Fast computation of the TGOSPA metric for multiple target tracking via unbalanced optimal transport
Authors: Viktor Nevelius Wernholm, Alfred Wärnsäter, Axel Ringh
Abstract: In multiple target tracking, it is important to be able to evaluate the performance of different tracking algorithms. The trajectory generalized optimal sub-pattern assignment metric (TGOSPA) is a recently proposed metric for such evaluations. The TGOSPA metric is computed as the solution to an optimization problem, but for large tracking scenarios, solving this problem becomes computationally demanding. In this paper, we present an approximation algorithm for evaluating the TGOSPA metric, based on casting the TGOSPA problem as an unbalanced multimarginal optimal transport problem. Following recent advances in computational optimal transport, we introduce an entropy regularization and derive an iterative scheme for solving the Lagrangian dual of the regularized problem. Numerical results suggest that our proposed algorithm is more computationally efficient than the alternative of computing the exact metric using a linear programming solver, while still providing an adequate approximation of the metric.

Title: ECLARE: Efficient cross-planar learning for anisotropic resolution enhancement
Authors: Samuel W. Remedios, Shuwen Wei, Shuo Han, Jinwei Zhang, Aaron Carass, Kurt G. Schilling, Dzung L. Pham, Jerry L. Prince, Blake E. Dewey
Abstract: In clinical imaging, magnetic resonance (MR) image volumes are often acquired as stacks of 2D slices with decreased scan times, improved signal-to-noise ratio, and image contrasts unique to 2D MR pulse sequences. While this is sufficient for clinical evaluation, automated algorithms designed for 3D analysis perform poorly on multi-slice 2D MR volumes, especially those with thick slices and gaps between slices. Super-resolution (SR) methods aim to address this problem, but previous methods do not address all of the following: slice profile shape estimation, slice gap, domain shift, and non-integer or arbitrary upsampling factors. In this paper, we propose ECLARE (Efficient Cross-planar Learning for Anisotropic Resolution Enhancement), a self-SR method that addresses each of these factors. ECLARE uses a slice profile estimated from the multi-slice 2D MR volume, trains a network to learn the mapping from low-resolution to high-resolution in-plane patches from the same volume, and performs SR with anti-aliasing. We compared ECLARE to cubic B-spline interpolation, SMORE, and other contemporary SR methods. We used realistic and representative simulations so that quantitative performance against ground truth can be computed, and ECLARE outperformed all other methods in both signal recovery and downstream tasks. Importantly, as ECLARE does not use external training data it cannot suffer from domain shift between training and testing. Our code is open-source and available at this https URL.

Title: Development of a magnetorheological hand exoskeleton featuring a high force-to-power ratio for enhanced grip endurance
Authors: Wenbo Li, Xianlong Mai, Ying Li, Weihua Li, Shiwu Zhang, Lei Deng, Shuaishuai Sun
Abstract: Hand exoskeletons have significant potential in labor-intensive fields by mitigating hand grip fatigue, enhancing hand strength, and preventing injuries. However, most of the traditional hand exoskeletons are driven by motors, whose output force is limited in the constrained installation conditions. Besides, they also come with the disadvantages of high power consumption, complex and bulky assistive systems, and high instability. In this work, we develop a novel hand exoskeleton integrated with magnetorheological (MR) clutches that offers a high force-to-power ratio to improve grip endurance. The clutch features an enhanced structure design, a micro roller enhancing structure, which can significantly boost output forces. The experimental data demonstrate that the clutch can deliver a peak holding force of 380 N with a 1.48 W consumption, yielding a force-to-power ratio of 256.75N/W, which is 2.35 times higher than the best-reported actuator used for hand exoskeletons. This capability enables the designed MRHE to provide approximately 419.79 N support force for gripping. The designed MR hand exoskeleton is highly integrated, comprising an exoskeleton frame, MR clutches, a control unit, and a battery. Evaluations through static grip endurance tests and dynamic carrying and lifting tests confirm that the MR hand exoskeleton can effectively reduce muscle fatigue, extend grip endurance, and minimize injuries. These findings highlight its strong potential for practical applications in repetitive tasks such as carrying and lifting in industrial settings.

Title: TASTE: Text-Aligned Speech Tokenization and Embedding for Spoken Language Modeling
Authors: Liang-Hsuan Tseng, Yi-Chang Chen, Kuan-Yi Lee, Da-Shan Shiu, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: Recent efforts target spoken language models (SLMs) that not only listen but also speak for more natural human-LLM interaction. Joint speech-text modeling is a promising direction to achieve this. However, the effectiveness of recent speech tokens for joint modeling remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce Text-Aligned Speech Tokenization and Embedding (TASTE), a method that directly addresses the modality gap by aligning speech token with the corresponding text transcription during the tokenization stage. We propose a method that can achieve this through a attention-based aggregation mechanism and with speech reconstruction as the training objective. We conduct extensive experiments and show that TASTE can preserve essential paralinguistic information while dramatically reducing the token sequence length. With TASTE, we perform straightforward joint spoken language modeling by using Low-Rank Adaptation on the pre-trained text LLM. Experimental results show that TASTE-based SLMs perform comparable to previous work on SALMON and StoryCloze; while significantly outperform other pre-trained SLMs on speech continuation across subjective and objective evaluations. To our knowledge, TASTE is the first end-to-end approach that utilizes a reconstruction objective to automatically learn a text-aligned speech tokenization and embedding suitable for spoken language modeling. Our demo, code, and model are available at this https URL.

Title: Partition-wise Graph Filtering: A Unified Perspective Through the Lens of Graph Coarsening
Authors: Guoming Li, Jian Yang, Yifan Chen
Abstract: Filtering-based graph neural networks (GNNs) constitute a distinct class of GNNs that employ graph filters to handle graph-structured data, achieving notable success in various graph-related tasks. Conventional methods adopt a graph-wise filtering paradigm, imposing a uniform filter across all nodes, yet recent findings suggest that this rigid paradigm struggles with heterophilic graphs. To overcome this, recent works have introduced node-wise filtering, which assigns distinct filters to individual nodes, offering enhanced adaptability. However, a fundamental gap remains: a comprehensive framework unifying these two strategies is still absent, limiting theoretical insights into the filtering paradigms. Moreover, through the lens of Contextual Stochastic Block Model, we reveal that a synthesis of graph-wise and node-wise filtering provides a sufficient solution for classification on graphs exhibiting both homophily and heterophily, suggesting the risk of excessive parameterization and potential overfitting with node-wise filtering. To address the limitations, this paper introduces Coarsening-guided Partition-wise Filtering (CPF). CPF innovates by performing filtering on node partitions. The method begins with structure-aware partition-wise filtering, which filters node partitions obtained via graph coarsening algorithms, and then performs feature-aware partition-wise filtering, refining node embeddings via filtering on clusters produced by $k$-means clustering over features. In-depth analysis is conducted for each phase of CPF, showing its superiority over other paradigms. Finally, benchmark node classification experiments, along with a real-world graph anomaly detection application, validate CPF's efficacy and practical utility.

Title: Neurodyne: Neural Pitch Manipulation with Representation Learning and Cycle-Consistency GAN
Authors: Yicheng Gu, Chaoren Wang, Zhizheng Wu, Lauri Juvela
Abstract: Pitch manipulation is the process of producers adjusting the pitch of an audio segment to a specific key and intonation, which is essential in music production. Neural-network-based pitch-manipulation systems have been popular in recent years due to their superior synthesis quality compared to classical DSP methods. However, their performance is still limited due to their inaccurate feature disentanglement using source-filter models and the lack of paired in- and out-of-tune training data. This work proposes Neurodyne to address these issues. Specifically, Neurodyne uses adversarial representation learning to learn a pitch-independent latent representation to avoid inaccurate disentanglement and cycle-consistency training to create paired training data implicitly. Experimental results on global-key and template-based pitch manipulation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, marking improved synthesis quality while maintaining the original singer identity.
