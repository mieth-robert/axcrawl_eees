Title: ClusMFL: A Cluster-Enhanced Framework for Modality-Incomplete Multimodal Federated Learning in Brain Imaging Analysis
Authors: Xinpeng Wang, Rong Zhou, Han Xie, Xiaoying Tang, Lifang He, Carl Yang
Abstract: Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) has emerged as a promising approach for collaboratively training multimodal models across distributed clients, particularly in healthcare domains. In the context of brain imaging analysis, modality incompleteness presents a significant challenge, where some institutions may lack specific imaging modalities (e.g., PET, MRI, or CT) due to privacy concerns, device limitations, or data availability issues. While existing work typically assumes modality completeness or oversimplifies missing-modality scenarios, we simulate a more realistic setting by considering both client-level and instance-level modality incompleteness in this study. Building on this realistic simulation, we propose ClusMFL, a novel MFL framework that leverages feature clustering for cross-institutional brain imaging analysis under modality incompleteness. Specifically, ClusMFL utilizes the FINCH algorithm to construct a pool of cluster centers for the feature embeddings of each modality-label pair, effectively capturing fine-grained data distributions. These cluster centers are then used for feature alignment within each modality through supervised contrastive learning, while also acting as proxies for missing modalities, allowing cross-modal knowledge transfer. Furthermore, ClusMFL employs a modality-aware aggregation strategy, further enhancing the model's performance in scenarios with severe modality incompleteness. We evaluate the proposed framework on the ADNI dataset, utilizing structural MRI and PET scans. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ClusMFL achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to various baseline methods across varying levels of modality incompleteness, providing a scalable solution for cross-institutional brain imaging analysis.

Title: 3D ReX: Causal Explanations in 3D Neuroimaging Classification
Authors: Melane Navaratnarajah, Sophie A. Martin, David A. Kelly, Nathan Blake, Hana Chocker
Abstract: Explainability remains a significant problem for AI models in medical imaging, making it challenging for clinicians to trust AI-driven predictions. We introduce 3D ReX, the first causality-based post-hoc explainability tool for 3D models. 3D ReX uses the theory of actual causality to generate responsibility maps which highlight the regions most crucial to the model's decision. We test 3D ReX on a stroke detection model, providing insight into the spatial distribution of features relevant to stroke.

Title: Domain Randomization is Sample Efficient for Linear Quadratic Control
Authors: Tesshu Fujinami, Bruce D. Lee, Nikolai Matni, George J. Pappas
Abstract: We study the sample efficiency of domain randomization and robust control for the benchmark problem of learning the linear quadratic regulator (LQR). Domain randomization, which synthesizes controllers by minimizing average performance over a distribution of model parameters, has achieved empirical success in robotics, but its theoretical properties remain poorly understood. We establish that with an appropriately chosen sampling distribution, domain randomization achieves the optimal asymptotic rate of decay in the excess cost, matching certainty equivalence. We further demonstrate that robust control, while potentially overly conservative, exhibits superior performance in the low-data regime due to its ability to stabilize uncertain systems with coarse parameter estimates. We propose a gradient-based algorithm for domain randomization that performs well in numerical experiments, which enables us to validate the trends predicted by our analysis. These results provide insights into the use of domain randomization in learning-enabled control, and highlight several open questions about its application to broader classes of systems.

Title: Stochastic Real-Time Deception in Nash Equilibrium Seeking for Games with Quadratic Payoffs
Authors: Michael Tang, Miroslav Krstic, Jorge Poveda
Abstract: In multi-agent autonomous systems, deception is a fundamental concept which characterizes the exploitation of unbalanced information to mislead victims into choosing oblivious actions. This effectively alters the system's long term behavior, leading to outcomes that may be beneficial to the deceiver but detrimental to victim. We study this phenomenon for a class of model-free Nash equilibrium seeking (NES) where players implement independent stochastic exploration signals to learn the pseudogradient flow. In particular, we show that deceptive players who obtain real-time measurements of other players' stochastic perturbation can incorporate this information into their own NES action update, consequentially steering the overall dynamics to a new operating point that could potentially improve the payoffs of the deceptive players. We consider games with quadratic payoff functions, as this restriction allows us to derive a more explicit formulation of the capabilities of the deceptive players. By leveraging results on multi-input stochastic averaging for dynamical systems, we establish local exponential (in probability) convergence for the proposed deceptive NES dynamics. To illustrate our results, we apply them to a two player quadratic game.

Title: A Comprehensive Survey on Generative AI for Video-to-Music Generation
Authors: Shulei Ji, Songruoyao Wu, Zihao Wang, Shuyu Li, Kejun Zhang
Abstract: The burgeoning growth of video-to-music generation can be attributed to the ascendancy of multimodal generative models. However, there is a lack of literature that comprehensively combs through the work in this field. To fill this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive review of video-to-music generation using deep generative AI techniques, focusing on three key components: visual feature extraction, music generation frameworks, and conditioning mechanisms. We categorize existing approaches based on their designs for each component, clarifying the roles of different strategies. Preceding this, we provide a fine-grained classification of video and music modalities, illustrating how different categories influence the design of components within the generation pipelines. Furthermore, we summarize available multimodal datasets and evaluation metrics while highlighting ongoing challenges in the field.

Title: Local Flaw Detection with Adaptive Pyramid Image Fusion Across Spatial Sampling Resolution for SWRs
Authors: Siyu You, Huayi Gou, Leilei Yang, Zhiliang Liu, Mingjian Zuo
Abstract: The inspection of local flaws (LFs) in Steel Wire Ropes (SWRs) is crucial for ensuring safety and reliability in various industries. Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) imaging is commonly used for non-destructive testing, but its effectiveness is often hindered by the combined effects of inspection speed and sampling rate. To address this issue, the impacts of inspection speed and sampling rate on image quality are studied, as variations in these factors can cause stripe noise, axial compression of defect features, and increased interference, complicating accurate detection. We define the relationship between inspection speed and sampling rate as spatial sampling resolution (SSR) and propose an adaptive SSR target-feature-oriented (AS-TFO) method. This method incorporates adaptive adjustment and pyramid image fusion techniques to enhance defect detection under different SSR scenarios. Experimental results show that under high SSR scenarios, the method achieves a precision of 92.54% and recall of 98.41%. It remains robust under low SSR scenarios with a precision of 94.87% and recall of 97.37%. The overall results show that the proposed method outperforms conventional approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. This improvement in detection accuracy and robustness is particularly valuable for handling complex inspection conditions, where inspection speed and sampling rate can vary significantly, making detection more robust and reliable in industrial settings.

Title: A Novel Gain Modeling Technique for LLC Resonant Converters based on The Hybrid Deep-Learning/GMDH Neural Network
Authors: Parham Mohammadi
Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid approach for modeling the voltage gain of LLC resonant converters by combining deep-learning neural networks with the polynomial based Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH). While deep learning offers high accuracy in predicting nonlinear converter behavior, it produces complex network models. GMDH neural networks, in contrast, yield simpler algebraic equations that can be more convenient in converter design. By training a deep network on data from an FPGA based real time simulator and then using the network s predictions to train a GMDH model, the proposed hybrid method achieves both high accuracy and design friendly simplicity. Experimental results show significant improvements over traditional methods such as First Harmonic Approximation (FHA) and frequency domain corrections, particularly for wide operating ranges.

Title: Generative AI Enabled Robust Data Augmentation for Wireless Sensing in ISAC Networks
Authors: Jiacheng Wang, Changyuan Zhao, Hongyang Du, Geng Sun, Jiawen Kang, Shiwen Mao, Dusit Niyato, Dong In Kim
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) uses the same software and hardware resources to achieve both communication and sensing functionalities. Thus, it stands as one of the core technologies of 6G and has garnered significant attention in recent years. In ISAC systems, a variety of machine learning models are trained to analyze and identify signal patterns, thereby ensuring reliable sensing and communications. However, considering factors such as communication rates, costs, and privacy, collecting sufficient training data from various ISAC scenarios for these models is impractical. Hence, this paper introduces a generative AI (GenAI) enabled robust data augmentation scheme. The scheme first employs a conditioned diffusion model trained on a limited amount of collected CSI data to generate new samples, thereby expanding the sample quantity. Building on this, the scheme further utilizes another diffusion model to enhance the sample quality, thereby facilitating the data augmentation in scenarios where the original sensing data is insufficient and unevenly distributed. Moreover, we propose a novel algorithm to estimate the acceleration and jerk of signal propagation path length changes from CSI. We then use the proposed scheme to enhance the estimated parameters and detect the number of targets based on the enhanced data. The evaluation reveals that our scheme improves the detection performance by up to 70%, demonstrating reliability and robustness, which supports the deployment and practical use of the ISAC network.

Title: Hybrid Frequency Transmission for Upload Latency Minimization of IoT Devices in HSR Scenario Aided by Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces
Authors: Tianyou Li, Tonghua Wei, Dapeng Li
Abstract: The explosively growing demand for Internet of Things (IoT) in high-speed railway (HSR) scenario has attracted a lot of attention amongst researchers. However, limited IoT device (IoTD) batteries and large information upload latency still remain critical impediments to practical service applications. In this paper, we consider a HSR wireless mobile communication system, where two intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) are deployed to help solve the problems above. Considering the carrier aggregation method, the IRS needs to be optimized globally in hybrid frequency bands. Meanwhile, to ensure information security, the transmission to the mobile communication relay (MCR) on the train is covert to passengers in the carriage by IRS. This problem is challenging to handle since the variables are coupled with each other and some tricky constraints. We firstly transform the original sum-of-ratios problem into the more tractable parametric problem. Then, the block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm is adopted to decouple the problem into two main sub-problems, and the downlink and uplink settings are alternatively optimized using low-complexity iterative algorithms. Finally, a heuristic algorithm to mitigate the Doppler spread is proposed to further improve the performance. Simulation results corroborate the performance improvement of the proposed algorithm.

Title: ComplexBeat: Breathing Rate Estimation from Complex CSI
Authors: Sitian Li, Andreas Toftegaard Kristensen, Andreas Burg, Alexios Balatsoukas-Stimming
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of channel state information (CSI) from a WiFi system to estimate the breathing rate of a person in a room. In order to extract WiFi CSI components that are sensitive to breathing, we propose to consider the delay domain channel impulse response (CIR), while most state-of-the-art methods consider its frequency domain representation. One obstacle while processing the CSI data is that its amplitude and phase are highly distorted by measurement uncertainties. We thus also propose an amplitude calibration method and a phase offset calibration method for CSI measured in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Finally, we implement a complete breathing rate estimation system in order to showcase the effectiveness of our proposed calibration and CSI extraction methods.

Title: RadSplatter: Extending 3D Gaussian Splatting to Radio Frequencies for Wireless Radiomap Extrapolation
Authors: Yiheng Wang, Ye Xue, Shutao Zhang, Tsung-Hui Chang
Abstract: A radiomap represents the spatial distribution of wireless signal strength, critical for applications like network optimization and autonomous driving. However, constructing radiomap relies on measuring radio signal power across the entire system, which is costly in outdoor environments due to large network scales. We present RadSplatter, a framework that extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to radio frequencies for efficient and accurate radiomap extrapolation from sparse measurements. RadSplatter models environmental scatterers and radio paths using 3D Gaussians, capturing key factors of radio wave propagation. It employs a relaxed-mean (RM) scheme to reparameterize the positions of 3D Gaussians from noisy and dense 3D point clouds. A camera-free 3DGS-based projection is proposed to map 3D Gaussians onto 2D radio beam patterns. Furthermore, a regularized loss function and recursive fine-tuning using highly structured sparse measurements in real-world settings are applied to ensure robust generalization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show state-of-the-art extrapolation accuracy and execution speed.

Title: Radar Network for Gait Monitoring: Technology and Validation
Authors: Ignacio E. López-Delgado, Víctor Navarro-López, Francisco Grandas-Pérez, Juan I. Godino-Llorente, Jesús Grajal
Abstract: In recent years, radar-based devices have emerged as an alternative approach for gait monitoring. However, the radar configuration and the algorithms used to extract the gait parameters often differ between contributions, lacking a systematic evaluation of the most appropriate setup. Additionally, radar-based studies often exclude motorically impaired subjects, leaving it unclear whether the existing algorithms are applicable to such populations. In this paper, a radar network is developed and validated by monitoring the gait of five healthy individuals and three patients with Parkinson's disease. Six configurations and four algorithms were compared using Vicon as ground-truth to determine the most appropriate solution for gait monitoring. The best results were obtained using only three nodes: two oriented towards the feet and one towards the torso. The most accurate stride velocity and distance in the state of the art were obtained with this configuration. Moreover, we show that analyzing the feet velocity increases the reliability of the temporal parameters, especially with aged or motorically impaired subjects. The contribution is significant for the implementation of radar networks in clinical and domestic environments, as it addresses critical aspects concerning the radar network configuration and algorithms.

Title: Task-Oriented Semantic Communication for Stereo-Vision 3D Object Detection
Authors: Zijian Cao, Hua Zhang, Le Liang, Haotian Wang, Shi Jin, Geoffrey Ye Li
Abstract: With the development of computer vision, 3D object detection has become increasingly important in many real-world applications. Limited by the computing power of sensor-side hardware, the detection task is sometimes deployed on remote computing devices or the cloud to execute complex algorithms, which brings massive data transmission overhead. In response, this paper proposes an optical flow-driven semantic communication framework for the stereo-vision 3D object detection task. The proposed framework fully exploits the dependence of stereo-vision 3D detection on semantic information in images and prioritizes the transmission of this semantic information to reduce total transmission data sizes while ensuring the detection accuracy. Specifically, we develop an optical flow-driven module to jointly extract and recover semantics from the left and right images to reduce the loss of the left-right photometric alignment semantic information and improve the accuracy of depth inference. Then, we design a 2D semantic extraction module to identify and extract semantic meaning around the objects to enhance the transmission of semantic information in the key areas. Finally, a fusion network is used to fuse the recovered semantics, and reconstruct the stereo-vision images for 3D detection. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves the detection accuracy by nearly 70% and outperforms the traditional method, especially for the low signal-to-noise ratio regime.

Title: Cross-Domain Continual Learning for Edge Intelligence in Wireless ISAC Networks
Authors: Jingzhi Hu, Xin Li, Zhou Su, Jun Luo
Abstract: In wireless networks with integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), edge intelligence (EI) is expected to be developed at edge devices (ED) for sensing user activities based on channel state information (CSI). However, due to the CSI being highly specific to users' characteristics, the CSI-activity relationship is notoriously domain dependent, essentially demanding EI to learn sufficient datasets from various domains in order to gain cross-domain sensing capability. This poses a crucial challenge owing to the EDs' limited resources, for which storing datasets across all domains will be a significant burden. In this paper, we propose the EdgeCL framework, enabling the EI to continually learn-then-discard each incoming dataset, while remaining resilient to catastrophic forgetting. We design a transformer-based discriminator for handling sequences of noisy and nonequispaced CSI samples. Besides, we propose a distilled core-set based knowledge retention method with robustness-enhanced optimization to train the discriminator, preserving its performance for previous domains while preventing future forgetting. Experimental evaluations show that EdgeCL achieves 89% of performance compared to cumulative training while consuming only 3% of its memory, mitigating forgetting by 79%.

Title: Dimension reduction methods, persistent homology and machine learning for EEG signal analysis of Interictal Epileptic Discharges
Authors: Annika Stiehl, Stefan Geißelsöder, Nicole Ille, Fabienne Anselstetter, Harald Bornfleth, Christian Uhl
Abstract: Recognizing specific events in medical data requires trained personnel. To aid the classification, machine learning algorithms can be applied. In this context, medical records are usually high-dimensional, although a lower dimension can also reflect the dynamics of the signal. In this study, electroencephalogram data with Interictal Epileptic Discharges (IEDs) are investigated. First, the dimensions are reduced using Dynamical Component Analysis (DyCA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), respectively. The reduced data are examined using topological data analysis (TDA), specifically using a persistent homology algorithm. The persistent homology results are used for targeted feature generation. The features are used to train and evaluate a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to distinguish IEDs from background activities.

Title: An Attention-Assisted AI Model for Real-Time Underwater Sound Speed Estimation Leveraging Remote Sensing Sea Surface Temperature Data
Authors: Pengfei Wu, Wei Huang, Yujie Shi, Hao Zhang
Abstract: The estimation of underwater sound velocity distribution serves as a critical basis for facilitating effective underwater communication and precise positioning, given that variations in sound velocity influence the path of signal transmission. Conventional techniques for the direct measurement of sound velocity, as well as methods that involve the inversion of sound velocity utilizing acoustic field data, necessitate on--site data collection. This requirement not only places high demands on device deployment, but also presents challenges in achieving real-time estimation of sound velocity distribution. In order to construct a real-time sound velocity field and eliminate the need for underwater onsite data measurement operations, we propose a self-attention embedded multimodal data fusion convolutional neural network (SA-MDF-CNN) for real-time underwater sound speed profile (SSP) estimation. The proposed model seeks to elucidate the inherent relationship between remote sensing sea surface temperature (SST) data, the primary component characteristics of historical SSPs, and their spatial coordinates. This is achieved by employing CNNs and attention mechanisms to extract local and global correlations from the input data, respectively. The ultimate objective is to facilitate a rapid and precise estimation of sound velocity distribution within a specified task area. Experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper has lower root mean square error (RMSE) and stronger robustness than other state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Exact Sum Distribution of alpha-eta-kappa-mu Fading Channels for Statistical Performance Analysis of RRS-Based Wireless Transmission
Authors: Rayees Ahmad Wani, Rajeev Rajagopal, Pranay Bhardwaj, El Mehdi Amhoud, S. M. Zafaruddin
Abstract: Reconfigurable refractive surface (RRS) is an efficient alternative to holographic multiple input multiple outputs (HMIMO) systems that can serve as a transmission unit operating in the signal refraction mode. RRS transmissions experience near-field propagation due to the proximity of the transmission feed and far-field propagation for the user located farther from the transmitting unit. There is limited research on the effect of channel fading on far-field users in RRS-based transmissions. In this paper, we conduct an exact statistical analysis of RRS-based transmission considering alpha-eta-kappa-mu fading model for the far-field user and the near-field effect of transmission feed. First, we show the exact statistical analysis for the RRS transmission over alpha-eta-kappa-mu fading model consisting of multiple infinite-series representations with multivariate Fox-H function. Next, we develop a novel approach to derive the density and distribution functions for the resultant fading channel of the RRS system in terms of multivariate Fox-H functions without involving infinite series approximations for tractable performance analysis. We present the exact outage probability and average bit-error-rate (BER) performance of single-element and multiple-element RRS systems to validate the proposed analysis further. We also obtain the diversity order of the system by analyzing the outage probability at a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Computer simulations demonstrate the relevance of the developed statistical results for RRS-based wireless systems over the generalized fading model for a comprehensive performance evaluation.

Title: Beyond Diagonal RIS for ISAC Network: Statistical Analysis and Network Parameter Estimation
Authors: Thanh Luan Nguyen, Georges Kaddoum, Bassant Selim, Chadi Assi
Abstract: This paper investigates the use of beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) with $N$ elements to advance integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). We address a key gap in the statistical characterizations of the radar signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) by deriving tractable closed-form cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) for these metrics. Our approach maximizes the radar SNR by jointly configuring radar beamforming and BD-RIS phase shifts. Subsequently, zero-forcing is adopted to mitigate user interference, enhancing the communication SINR. To meet ISAC outage requirements, we propose an analytically-driven successive non-inversion sampling (SNIS) algorithm for estimating network parameters satisfying network outage constraints. Numerical results illustrate the accuracy of the derived CDFs and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SNIS algorithm.

Title: A Bayesian Perspective on Uncertainty Quantification for Estimated Graph Signals
Authors: Lennard Rompelberg, Michael T. Schaub
Abstract: We present a Bayesian perspective on quantifying the uncertainty of graph signals estimated or reconstructed from imperfect observations. We show that many conventional methods of graph signal estimation, reconstruction and imputation, can be reinterpreted as finding the mean of a posterior Gaussian distribution, with a covariance matrix shaped by the graph structure. In this perspective, assumptions of signal smoothness as well as bandlimitedness are naturally expressible as the choice of certain prior distributions; noisy, noise-free or partial observations are expressible in terms of certain likelihood models. In addition to providing a point estimate, as most standard estimation strategies do, our probabilistic framework enables us to characterize the shape of the estimated signal distribution around the estimate in terms of the posterior covariance matrix.

Title: Artificial Intelligence-derived Vascular Age from Photoplethysmography: A Novel Digital Biomarker for Cardiovascular Health
Authors: Guangkun Nie, Qinghao Zhao, Gongzheng Tang, Yaxin Li, Shenda Hong
Abstract: With the increasing availability of wearable devices, photoplethysmography (PPG) has emerged as a promising non-invasive tool for monitoring human hemodynamics. We propose a deep learning framework to estimate vascular age (AI-vascular age) from PPG signals, incorporating a distribution-aware loss to address biases caused by imbalanced data. The model was developed using data from the UK Biobank (UKB), with 98,672 participants in the development cohort and 113,559 participants (144,683 data pairs) for clinical evaluation. After adjusting for key confounders, individuals with a vascular age gap (AI-vascular age minus calendar age) exceeding 9 years had a significantly higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) (HR = 2.37, p < 0.005) and secondary outcomes, including diabetes (HR = 2.69, p < 0.005), hypertension (HR = 2.88, p < 0.005), coronary heart disease (HR = 2.20, p < 0.005), heart failure (HR = 2.15, p < 0.005), myocardial infarction (HR = 2.51, p < 0.005), stroke (HR = 2.55, p < 0.005), and all-cause mortality (HR = 2.51, p < 0.005). Conversely, participants with a vascular age gap below -9 years exhibited a significantly lower incidence of these outcomes. We further evaluated the longitudinal applicability of AI-vascular age using serial PPG data from the UKB, demonstrating its value in risk stratification by leveraging AI-vascular age at two distinct time points to predict future MACCE incidence. External validation was performed on a MIMIC-III-derived cohort (n = 2,343), where each one-year increase in vascular age gap was significantly associated with elevated in-hospital mortality risk (OR = 1.02, p < 0.005). In conclusion, our study establishes AI-vascular age as a novel, non-invasive digital biomarker for cardiovascular health assessment.

Title: Efficient UAV Coverage in Large Convex Quadrilateral Areas with Elliptical Footprints
Authors: Alexander Vavoulas, Konstantinos K. Delibasis, Harilaos G. Sandalidis, George Nousias, Nicholas Vaiopoulos
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have gained significant attention for improving wireless communication, especially in emergencies or as a complement to existing cellular infrastructure. This letter addresses the problem of efficiently covering a large convex quadrilateral using multiple UAVs, where each UAV generates elliptical coverage footprints based on its altitude and antenna tilt. The challenge is approached using circle-packing techniques within a unit square to arrange UAVs in an optimal configuration. Subsequently, a homography transformation is applied to map the unit square onto the quadrilateral area, ensuring that the UAVs' elliptical footprints cover the entire region. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, providing insight into coverage density and optimal altitude configurations for different placement scenarios. The results highlight the scalability and potential for improving UAV-based communication systems, focusing on maximizing coverage efficiency in large areas with irregular shapes.

Authors: Andrei Sperilă, Alessio Iovine, Sorin Olaru, Patrick Panciatici
Abstract: A two-layer control architecture is proposed, which promotes scalable implementations for model predictive controllers. The top layer acts as both reference governor for the bottom layer, and as a feedback controller for the regulated network. By employing set-based methods, global theoretical guarantees are obtained by enforcing local constraints upon the variables of the network and of the first layer's implementation. The proposed technique offers recursive feasibility guarantees as one of its central features, and the expressions of the resulting predictive strategies bear a striking resemblance to classical formulations from model predictive control literature, allowing for flexible and easily customizable implementations.

Title: Pricing is All You Need to Improve Traffic Routing
Authors: Yu Tang, Kaan Ozbay, Li Jin
Abstract: We investigate the design of pricing policies that enhance driver adherence to route guidance, ensuring effective routing control. The major novelty lies in that we adopt a Markov chain to model drivers' compliance rates conditioned on both traffic states and tolls. By formulating the managed traffic network as a nonlinear stochastic dynamical system, we can quantify in a more realistic way the impacts of driver route choices and thus determine appropriate tolls. Specially, we focus on a network comprised of one corridor and one local street. We assume that a reasonable routing policy is specified in advance. However, drivers could be reluctant to be detoured. Thus a fixed toll is set on the corridor to give drivers incentives to choose the local street. We evaluate the effectiveness of the given routing and pricing policies via stability analysis. We suggest using the stability and instability conditions to establish lower and upper bounds on throughput. This allows us to select suitable tolls that maximize these bounds.

Title: Automated Linear Parameter-Varying Modeling of Nonlinear Systems: A Global Embedding Approach
Authors: E. Javier Olucha, Patrick J. W. Koelewijn, Amritam Das, Roland Tóth
Abstract: In this paper, an automated Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) model conversion approach is proposed for nonlinear dynamical systems. The proposed method achieves global embedding of the original nonlinear behavior of the system by leveraging the second fundamental theorem of calculus to factorize matrix function expressions without any approximation. The implementation of the proposed method in the LPVcore toolbox for Matlab is discussed, and its performance is showcased on a comprehensive example of automated LPV model conversion of an unbalanced disk system, which is then used to design an LPV controller that is deployed on the original nonlinear system. In addition, the conversion capabilities are further demonstrated by obtaining an LPV embedding of a three-degree-of-freedom control moment gyroscope. All software implementations are available at this http URL.

Title: Semantica: Decentralized Search using a LLM-Guided Semantic Tree Overlay
Authors: Petru Neague, Quinten Stokkink, Naman Goel, Johan Pouwelse
Abstract: Centralized search engines are key for the Internet, but lead to undesirable concentration of power. Decentralized alternatives fail to offer equal document retrieval accuracy and speed. Nevertheless, Semantic Overlay Networks can come close to the performance of centralized solutions when the semantics of documents are properly captured. This work uses embeddings from Large Language Models to capture semantics and fulfill the promise of Semantic Overlay Networks. Our proposed algorithm, called Semantica, constructs a prefix tree (trie) utilizing document embeddings calculated by a language model. Users connect to each other based on the embeddings of their documents, ensuring that semantically similar users are directly linked. Thereby, this construction makes it more likely for user searches to be answered by the users that they are directly connected to, or by the users they are close to in the network connection graph. The implementation of our algorithm also accommodates the semantic diversity of individual users by spawning "clone" user identifiers in the tree. Our experiments use emulation with a real-world workload to show Semantica's ability to identify and connect to similar users quickly. Semantica finds up to ten times more semantically similar users than current state-of-the-art approaches. At the same time, Semantica can retrieve more than two times the number of relevant documents given the same network load. We also make our code publicly available to facilitate further research in the area.

Title: Scalable and Robust Physics-Informed Graph Neural Networks for Water Distribution Systems
Authors: Inaam Ashraf, André Artelt, Barbara Hammer
Abstract: Water distribution systems (WDSs) are an important part of critical infrastructure becoming increasingly significant in the face of climate change and urban population growth. We propose a robust and scalable surrogate deep learning (DL) model to enable efficient planning, expansion, and rehabilitation of WDSs. Our approach incorporates an improved graph neural network architecture, an adapted physics-informed algorithm, an innovative training scheme, and a physics-preserving data normalization method. Evaluation results on a number of WDSs demonstrate that our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art DL model. Moreover, our method allows us to scale the model to bigger and more realistic WDSs. Furthermore, our approach makes the model more robust to out-of-distribution input features (demands, pipe diameters). Hence, our proposed method constitutes a significant step towards bridging the simulation-to-real gap in the use of artificial intelligence for WDSs.

Title: Learning Plasma Dynamics and Robust Rampdown Trajectories with Predict-First Experiments at TCV
Authors: Allen M. Wang, Alessandro Pau, Cristina Rea, Oswin So, Charles Dawson, Olivier Sauter, Mark D. Boyer, Anna Vu, Cristian Galperti, Chuchu Fan, Antoine Merle, Yoeri Poels, Cristina Venturini, Stefano Marchioni, the TCV Team
Abstract: The rampdown in tokamak operations is a difficult to simulate phase during which the plasma is often pushed towards multiple instability limits. To address this challenge, and reduce the risk of disrupting operations, we leverage recent advances in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) to develop a neural state-space model (NSSM) that predicts plasma dynamics during Tokamak à Configuration Variable (TCV) rampdowns. By integrating simple physics structure and data-driven models, the NSSM efficiently learns plasma dynamics during the rampdown from a modest dataset of 311 pulses with only five pulses in the reactor relevant high performance regime. The NSSM is parallelized across uncertainties, and reinforcement learning (RL) is applied to design trajectories that avoid multiple instability limits with high probability. Experiments at TCV ramping down high performance plasmas show statistically significant improvements in current and energy at plasma termination, with improvements in speed through continuous re-training. A predict-first experiment, increasing plasma current by 20\% from baseline, demonstrates the NSSM's ability to make small extrapolations with sufficient accuracy to design trajectories that successfully terminate the pulse. The developed approach paves the way for designing tokamak controls with robustness to considerable uncertainty, and demonstrates the relevance of the SciML approach to learning plasma dynamics for rapidly developing robust trajectories and controls during the incremental campaigns of upcoming burning plasma tokamaks.

Title: Hovering Flight of Soft-Actuated Insect-Scale Micro Aerial Vehicles using Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Yi-Hsuan Hsiao, Wei-Tung Chen, Yun-Sheng Chang, Pulkit Agrawal, YuFeng Chen
Abstract: Soft-actuated insect-scale micro aerial vehicles (IMAVs) pose unique challenges for designing robust and computationally efficient controllers. At the millimeter scale, fast robot dynamics ($\sim$ms), together with system delay, model uncertainty, and external disturbances significantly affect flight performances. Here, we design a deep reinforcement learning (RL) controller that addresses system delay and uncertainties. To initialize this neural network (NN) controller, we propose a modified behavior cloning (BC) approach with state-action re-matching to account for delay and domain-randomized expert demonstration to tackle uncertainty. Then we apply proximal policy optimization (PPO) to fine-tune the policy during RL, enhancing performance and smoothing commands. In simulations, our modified BC substantially increases the mean reward compared to baseline BC; and RL with PPO improves flight quality and reduces command fluctuations. We deploy this controller on two different insect-scale aerial robots that weigh 720 mg and 850 mg, respectively. The robots demonstrate multiple successful zero-shot hovering flights, with the longest lasting 50 seconds and root-mean-square errors of 1.34 cm in lateral direction and 0.05 cm in altitude, marking the first end-to-end deep RL-based flight on soft-driven IMAVs.

Title: Sensing-based Robustness Challenges in Agricultural Robotic Harvesting
Authors: C. Beldek, J. Cunningham, M.Aydin, E. Sariyildiz, S. L. Phung, G.Alici
Abstract: This paper presents the challenges agricultural robotic harvesters face in detecting and localising fruits under various environmental disturbances. In controlled laboratory settings, both the traditional HSV (Hue Saturation Value) transformation and the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) deep learning model were employed. However, only YOLOv8 was utilised in outdoor experiments, as the HSV transformation was not capable of accurately drawing fruit contours. Experiments include ten distinct fruit patterns with six apples and six oranges. A grid structure for homography (perspective) transformation was employed to convert detected midpoints into 3D world coordinates. The experiments evaluated detection and localisation under varying lighting and background disturbances, revealing accurate performance indoors, but significant challenges outdoors. Our results show that indoor experiments using YOLOv8 achieved 100% detection accuracy, while outdoor conditions decreased performance, with an average accuracy of 69.15% for YOLOv8 under direct sunlight. The study demonstrates that real-world applications reveal significant limitations due to changing lighting, background disturbances, and colour and shape variability. These findings underscore the need for further refinement of algorithms and sensors to enhance the robustness of robotic harvesters for agricultural use.

Title: Incomplete Graph Learning: A Comprehensive Survey
Authors: Riting Xia, Huibo Liu, Anchen Li, Xueyan Liu, Yan Zhang, Chunxu Zhang, Bo Yang
Abstract: Graph learning is a prevalent field that operates on ubiquitous graph data. Effective graph learning methods can extract valuable information from graphs. However, these methods are non-robust and affected by missing attributes in graphs, resulting in sub-optimal outcomes. This has led to the emergence of incomplete graph learning, which aims to process and learn from incomplete graphs to achieve more accurate and representative results. In this paper, we conducted a comprehensive review of the literature on incomplete graph learning. Initially, we categorize incomplete graphs and provide precise definitions of relevant concepts, terminologies, and techniques, thereby establishing a solid understanding for readers. Subsequently, we classify incomplete graph learning methods according to the types of incompleteness: (1) attribute-incomplete graph learning methods, (2) attribute-missing graph learning methods, and (3) hybrid-absent graph learning methods. By systematically classifying and summarizing incomplete graph learning methods, we highlight the commonalities and differences among existing approaches, aiding readers in selecting methods and laying the groundwork for further advancements. In addition, we summarize the datasets, incomplete processing modes, evaluation metrics, and application domains used by the current methods. Lastly, we discuss the current challenges and propose future directions for incomplete graph learning, with the aim of stimulating further innovations in this crucial field. To our knowledge, this is the first review dedicated to incomplete graph learning, aiming to offer valuable insights for researchers in related this http URL developed an online resource to follow relevant research based on this review, available at this https URL

Title: Note-Level Singing Melody Transcription for Time-Aligned Musical Score Generation
Authors: Leekyung Kim, Sungwook Jeon, Wan Heo, Jonghun Park
Abstract: Automatic music transcription converts audio recordings into symbolic representations, facilitating music analysis, retrieval, and generation. A musical note is characterized by pitch, onset, and offset in an audio domain, whereas it is defined in terms of pitch and note value in a musical score domain. A time-aligned score, derived from timing information along with pitch and note value, allows matching a part of the score with the corresponding part of the music audio, enabling various applications. In this paper, we consider an extended version of the traditional note-level transcription task that recognizes onset, offset, and pitch, through including extraction of additional note value to generate a time-aligned score from an audio input. To address this new challenge, we propose an end-to-end framework that integrates recognition of the note value, pitch, and temporal information. This approach avoids error accumulation inherent in multi-stage methods and enhances accuracy through mutual reinforcement. Our framework employs tokenized representations specifically targeted for this task, through incorporating note value information. Furthermore, we introduce a pseudo-labeling technique to address a scarcity problem of annotated note value data. This technique produces approximate note value labels from existing datasets for the traditional note-level transcription. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model in note-level transcription tasks when compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. We also introduce new evaluation metrics that assess both temporal and note value aspects to demonstrate the robustness of the model. Moreover, qualitative assessments via visualized musical scores confirmed the effectiveness of our model in capturing the note values.

Title: Design and Implementation of a Dual Uncrewed Surface Vessel Platform for Bathymetry Research under High-flow Conditions
Authors: Dinesh Kumar, Amin Ghorbanpour, Kin Yen, Iman Soltani
Abstract: Bathymetry, the study of underwater topography, relies on sonar mapping of submerged structures. These measurements, critical for infrastructure health monitoring, often require expensive instrumentation. The high financial risk associated with sensor damage or vessel loss creates a reluctance to deploy uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) for bathymetry. However, the crewed-boat bathymetry operations, are costly, pose hazards to personnel, and frequently fail to achieve the stable conditions necessary for bathymetry data collection, especially under high currents. Further research is essential to advance autonomous control, navigation, and data processing technologies, with a particular focus on bathymetry. There is a notable lack of accessible hardware platforms that allow for integrated research in both bathymetry-focused autonomous control and navigation, as well as data evaluation and processing. This paper addresses this gap through the design and implementation of two complementary USV systems tailored for uncrewed bathymetry research. This includes a low-cost USV for Navigation And Control research (NAC-USV) and a second, high-end USV equipped with a high-resolution multi-beam sonar and the associated hardware for Bathymetry data quality Evaluation and Post-processing research (BEP-USV). The NAC-USV facilitates the investigation of autonomous, fail-safe navigation and control, emphasizing the stability requirements for high-quality bathymetry data collection while minimizing the risk to equipment. The BEP-USV, which mirrors the NAC-USV hardware, is then used for additional control validation and in-depth exploration of bathymetry data evaluation and post-processing methodologies. We detail the design and implementation of both systems, and open source the design. Furthermore, we demonstrate the system's effectiveness in a range of operational scenarios.

Title: A Graph-Enhanced Deep-Reinforcement Learning Framework for the Aircraft Landing Problem
Authors: Vatsal Maru
Abstract: The Aircraft Landing Problem (ALP) is one of the challenging problems in aircraft transportation and management. The challenge is to schedule the arriving aircraft in a sequence so that the cost and delays are optimized. There are various solution approaches to solving this problem, most of which are based on operations research algorithms and meta-heuristics. Although traditional methods perform better on one or the other factors, there remains a problem of solving real-time rescheduling and computational scalability altogether. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that combines graph neural networks with actor-critic architectures to address the ALP. This paper introduces three key contributions: A graph-based state representation that efficiently captures temporal and spatial relationships between aircraft, a specialized actor-critic architecture designed to handle multiple competing objectives in landing scheduling, and a runway balance strategy that ensures efficient resource utilization while maintaining safety constraints. The results show that the trained algorithm can be tested on different problem sets and the results are competitive to operation research algorithms. The experimental results on standard benchmark data sets demonstrate a 99.95 reduction in computational time compared to Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) and 38 higher runway throughput over First Come First Serve (FCFS) approaches. Therefore, the proposed solution is competitive to traditional approaches and achieves substantial advancements. Notably, it does not require retraining, making it particularly suitable for industrial deployment. The frameworks capability to generate solutions within 1 second enables real-time rescheduling, addressing critical requirements of air traffic management.

Title: DeepResonance: Enhancing Multimodal Music Understanding via Music-centric Multi-way Instruction Tuning
Authors: Zhuoyuan Mao, Mengjie Zhao, Qiyu Wu, Hiromi Wakaki, Yuki Mitsufuji
Abstract: Recent advancements in music large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved music understanding tasks, which involve the model's ability to analyze and interpret various musical elements. These improvements primarily focused on integrating both music and text inputs. However, the potential of incorporating additional modalities such as images, videos and textual music features to enhance music understanding remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose DeepResonance, a multimodal music understanding LLM fine-tuned via multi-way instruction tuning with multi-way aligned music, text, image, and video data. To this end, we construct Music4way-MI2T, Music4way-MV2T, and Music4way-Any2T, three 4-way training and evaluation datasets designed to enable DeepResonance to integrate both visual and textual music feature content. We also introduce multi-sampled ImageBind embeddings and a pre-alignment Transformer to enhance modality fusion prior to input into text LLMs, tailoring DeepResonance for multi-way instruction tuning. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performances across six music understanding tasks, highlighting the benefits of the auxiliary modalities and the structural superiority of DeepResonance. We plan to open-source the models and the newly constructed datasets.

Title: Rate Maximization for Downlink Pinching-Antenna Systems
Authors: Yanqing Xu, Zhiguo Ding, George K. Karagiannidis
Abstract: In this letter, we consider a new type of flexible-antenna system, termed pinching-antenna, where multiple low-cost pinching antennas, realized by activating small dielectric particles on a dielectric waveguide, are jointly used to serve a single-antenna user. Our goal is to maximize the downlink transmission rate by optimizing the locations of the pinching antennas. However, these locations affect both the path losses and the phase shifts of the user's effective channel gain, making the problem challenging to solve. To address this challenge and solve the problem in a low complexity manner, a relaxed optimization problem is developed that minimizes the impact of path loss while ensuring that the received signals at the user are constructive. This approach leads to a two-stage algorithm: in the first stage, the locations of the pinching antennas are optimized to minimize the large-scale path loss; in the second stage, the antenna locations are refined to maximize the received signal strength. Simulation results show that pinching-antenna systems significantly outperform conventional fixed-location antenna systems, and the proposed algorithm achieves nearly the same performance as the highly complex exhaustive search-based benchmark.

Title: Soft Arm-Motor Thrust Characterization for a Pneumatically Actuated Soft Morphing Quadrotor
Authors: Vidya Sumathy, Jakub Haluska, George Nikolokopoulos
Abstract: In this work, an experimental characterization of the configuration space of a soft, pneumatically actuated morphing quadrotor is presented, with a focus on precise thrust characterization of its flexible arms, considering the effect of downwash. Unlike traditional quadrotors, the soft drone has pneumatically actuated arms, introducing complex, nonlinear interactions between motor thrust and arm deformation, which make precise control challenging. The silicone arms are actuated using differential pressure to achieve flexibility and thus have a variable workspace compared to their fixed counter-parts. The deflection of the soft arms during compression and expansion is controlled throughout the flight. However, in real time, the downwash from the motor attached at the tip of the soft arm generates a significant and random disturbance on the arm. This disturbance affects both the desired deflection of the arm and the overall stability of the system. To address this factor, an experimental characterization of the effect of downwash on the deflection angle of the arm is conducted.

Title: One-bit Compressed Sensing using Generative Models
Authors: Swatantra Kafle, Geethu Joseph, Pramod K. Varshney
Abstract: This paper addresses the classical problem of one-bit compressed sensing using a deep learning-based reconstruction algorithm that leverages a trained generative model to enhance the signal reconstruction performance. The generator, a pre-trained neural network, learns to map from a low-dimensional latent space to a higher-dimensional set of sparse vectors. This generator is then used to reconstruct sparse vectors from their one-bit measurements by searching over its range. The presented algorithm provides an excellent reconstruction performance because the generative model can learn additional structural information about the signal beyond sparsity. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees on the reconstruction accuracy and sample complexity of the algorithm. Through numerical experiments using three publicly available image datasets, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and Omniglot, we demonstrate the superior performance of the algorithm compared to other existing algorithms and show that our algorithm can recover both the amplitude and the direction of the signal from one-bit measurements.

Title: Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Resource Allocation in Optical Networks: Hype or Hope?
Authors: Michael Doherty, Robin Matzner, Rasoul Sadeghi, Polina Bayvel, Alejandra Beghelli
Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamic resource allocation in optical networks has been the focus of intense research activity in recent years, with almost 100 peer-reviewed papers. We present a review of progress in the field, and identify significant gaps in benchmarking practices and reproducibility. To determine the strongest benchmark algorithms, we systematically evaluate several heuristics across diverse network topologies. We find that path count and sort criteria for path selection significantly affect the benchmark performance. We meticulously recreate the problems from five landmark papers and apply the improved benchmarks. Our comparisons demonstrate that simple heuristics consistently match or outperform the published RL solutions, often with an order of magnitude lower blocking probability. Furthermore, we present empirical lower bounds on network blocking using a novel defragmentation-based method, revealing that potential improvements over the benchmark heuristics are limited to 19--36\% increased traffic load for the same blocking performance in our examples. We make our simulation framework and results publicly available to promote reproducible research and standardized evaluation this https URL.

Title: Optimizing Social Network Interventions via Hypergradient-Based Recommender System Design
Authors: Marino Kühne, Panagiotis D. Grontas, Giulia De Pasquale, Giuseppe Belgioioso, Florian Dörfler, John Lygeros
Abstract: Although social networks have expanded the range of ideas and information accessible to users, they are also criticized for amplifying the polarization of user opinions. Given the inherent complexity of these phenomena, existing approaches to counteract these effects typically rely on handcrafted algorithms and heuristics. We propose an elegant solution: we act on the network weights that model user interactions on social networks (e.g., frequency of communication), to optimize a performance metric (e.g., polarization reduction), while users' opinions follow the classical Friedkin-Johnsen model. Our formulation gives rise to a challenging large-scale optimization problem with non-convex constraints, for which we develop a gradient-based algorithm. Our scheme is simple, scalable, and versatile, as it can readily integrate different, potentially non-convex, objectives. We demonstrate its merit by: (i) rapidly solving complex social network intervention problems with 3 million variables based on the Reddit and DBLP datasets; (ii) significantly outperforming competing approaches in terms of both computation time and disagreement reduction.

Title: On Erlang mixture approximations for differential equations with distributed time delays
Authors: Tobias K. S. Ritschel
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a general approach for approximate simulation and analysis of delay differential equations (DDEs) with distributed time delays based on methods for ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The key innovation is that we 1) approximate the kernel by the probability density function of an Erlang mixture and 2) use the linear chain trick to transform the approximate DDEs to ODEs. Furthermore, we prove that an approximation with infinitely many terms converges for continuous and bounded kernels and for specific choices of the coefficients. We compare the steady states of the original DDEs and their stability criteria to those of the approximate system of ODEs, and we propose an approach based on bisection and least-squares estimation for determining optimal parameter values in the approximation. Finally, we present numerical examples that demonstrate the accuracy and convergence rate obtained with the optimal parameters and the efficacy of the proposed approach for bifurcation analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. The numerical examples involve a modified logistic equation and a point reactor kinetics model of a molten salt nuclear fission reactor.

Title: FAMAC: A Federated Assisted Modified Actor-Critic Framework for Secured Energy Saving in 5G and Beyond Networks
Authors: Attai Ibrahim Abubakar, Michael S. Mollel, Metin Ozturk, Naeem Ramzan
Abstract: The constant surge in the traffic demand on cellular networks has led to continuous expansion in network capacity in order to accommodate existing and new service demands. This has given rise to ultra-dense base station deployment in 5G and beyond networks which leads to increased energy consumption in the network. Hence, these ultra-dense base station deployments must be operated in a way that the energy consumption of the network can be adapted to the spatio-temporal traffic demands on the network in order to minimize the overall energy consumption of the network. To achieve this goal, we leverage two artificial intelligence algorithms, federated learning and actor-critic algorithm, to develop a proactive and intelligent base station switching framework that can learn the operating policy of the small base station in an ultra-dense heterogeneous network (UDHN) that would result in maximum energy saving in the network while respecting the quality of service (QoS) constraints. The performance evaluation reveals that the proposed framework can achieve an energy saving that is about 77% more than that of the state-of-the-art solutions while respecting the QoS constraints of the network.

Title: Automated Lane Merging via Game Theory and Branch Model Predictive Control
Authors: Luyao Zhang, Shaohang Han, Sergio Grammatico
Abstract: We propose an integrated behavior and motion planning framework for the lane-merging problem. The behavior planner combines search-based planning with game theory to model vehicle interactions and plan multi-vehicle trajectories. Inspired by human drivers, we model the lane-merging problem as a gap selection process and determine the appropriate gap by solving a matrix game. Moreover, we introduce a branch model predictive control (BMPC) framework to account for the uncertain equilibrium strategies adopted by the surrounding vehicles, including Nash and Stackelberg strategies. A tailored numerical solver is developed to enhance computational efficiency by exploiting the tree structure inherent in BMPC. Finally, we validate our proposed integrated planner using real traffic data and demonstrate its effectiveness in handling interactions in dense traffic scenarios. The code is publicly available at: this https URL.

Title: Acoustic Prompt Tuning: Empowering Large Language Models with Audition Capabilities
Authors: Jinhua Liang, Xubo Liu, Wenwu Wang, Mark D. Plumbley, Huy Phan, Emmanouil Benetos
Abstract: The auditory system plays a substantial role in shaping the overall human perceptual experience. While prevailing large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs) have shown their promise in solving a wide variety of language and vision understanding tasks, only a few of them can be generalised to the audio domain without compromising their domain-specific capability. In this work, we introduce Acoustic Prompt Tuning (APT), a new adapter extending LLMs and VLMs to the audio domain by injecting audio embeddings to the input of LLMs, namely soft prompting. Specifically, APT applies an instruction-aware audio aligner to generate soft prompts, conditioned on both input text and sounds, as the inputs to the language model. To mitigate data scarcity in the audio domain, a curriculum learning strategy is proposed by formulating diverse audio tasks in a sequential manner. Moreover, we improve the audio language model by using interleaved audio-text embeddings as the input sequence. In this improved model, zero constraints are imposed on the input format, thus it is capable of tackling diverse modelling tasks, such as few-shot audio classification and audio comparison. To further evaluate the advanced ability of the audio networks, we introduce natural language audio reasoning (NLAR), a new task that analyses two audio clips by comparison and summarisation. Experiments show that APT-enhanced LLMs (namely APT-LLMs) achieve competitive results compared to the expert models (i.e., the networks trained on the target datasets) across various tasks. We finally demonstrate APT's ability in extending frozen VLMs to the audio domain without fine-tuning, achieving promising results in audio-visual question and answering. Our code and model weights will be released at this https URL

Title: Stability-Certified On-Policy Data-Driven LQR via Recursive Learning and Policy Gradient
Authors: Lorenzo Sforni, Guido Carnevale, Ivano Notarnicola, Giuseppe Notarstefano
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a data-driven framework to solve Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problems when the dynamics is unknown, with the additional challenge of providing stability certificates for the overall learning and control scheme. Specifically, in the proposed on-policy learning framework, the control input is applied to the actual (unknown) linear system while iteratively optimized. We propose a learning and control procedure, termed Relearn LQR, that combines a recursive least squares method with a direct policy search based on the gradient method. The resulting scheme is analyzed by modeling it as a feedback-interconnected nonlinear dynamical system. A Lyapunov-based approach, exploiting averaging and timescale separation theories for nonlinear systems, allows us to provide formal stability guarantees for the whole interconnected scheme. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is corroborated by numerical simulations, where Relearn LQR is deployed on an aircraft control problem, with both static and drifting parameters.

Title: TransfoRhythm: A Transformer Architecture Conductive to Blood Pressure Estimation via Solo PPG Signal Capturing
Authors: Amir Arjomand, Amin Boudesh, Farnoush Bayatmakou, Kenneth B. Kent, Arash Mohammadi
Abstract: Recent statistics indicate that approximately 1.3 billion individuals worldwide suffer from hypertension, a leading cause of premature death globally. Blood Pressure (BP) serves as a critical health indicator for accurate and timely diagnosis and/or treatment of hypertension. Traditional BP measurement methods rely on cuff-based approaches, which lack real-time, continuous, and reliable BP estimates, crucial for the timely diagnosis/treatment of hypertension. Driven by recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), there has been a surge of interest in developing data-driven and cuff-less BP estimation solutions. In this context, current literature predominantly focuses on coupling Electrocardiography (ECG) and Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, though this approach is constrained by reliance on multiple sensor types. An alternative, utilizing standalone PPG signals, presents challenges due to the absence of auxiliary sensors (ECG), requiring the use of morphological features while addressing motion artifacts and high-frequency noise. To address these issues, the paper introduces the TransfoRhythm framework, a Transformer-based DNN architecture built upon the recently released physiological database, MIMIC-IV. Leveraging the Multi-Head Attention (MHA) mechanism, TransfoRhythm identifies dependencies and similarities across data segments, forming a robust framework for cuff-less BP estimation solely using PPG signals. To our knowledge, this paper represents the first study to apply the MIMIC IV dataset for cuff-less BP estimation. TransfoRhythm achieves highly accurate results with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of [2.21, 1.84] and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of [1.37, 1.06] for systolic and diastolic blood pressures, respectively.

Title: A Closer Look at Mortality Risk Prediction from Electrocardiograms
Authors: Platon Lukyanenko, Joshua Mayourian, Mingxuan Liu, John K. Triedman, Sunil J. Ghelani, William G. La Cava
Abstract: Several recent studies combine large private ECG databases with AI to predict patient mortality. These studies typically use a few, highly variable, modeling approaches. While benchmarking these approaches has historically been limited by a lack of public ECG datasets, this changed with the 2023 release of MIMIC-IV, containing 795,546 ECGs from a U.S. hospital system, and the 2020 release of Code-15, containing 345,779 ECGs collected during routine care in Brazil. We benchmark over 500 AI-ECG survival models predicting all-cause mortality on Code-15 and MIMIC-IV with 2 neural architectures, 4 Deep-Survival-Analysis approaches, and classifiers predicting mortality at 4 time horizons. We extend the highest-performing approach to a dataset from Boston Children's Hospital (BCH, 225,379 ECGs). Models train with and without demographics (age/sex) and evaluate across datasets. The best performing Deep-Survival-Analysis models trained with ECG and demographics yield good median Concordance Indices (Code-15: 0.82, MIMIC-IV: 0.78, BCH: 0.76) and AUPRC scores (median 1-yr/5-yr, Code-15: 0.07/0.15; MIMIC-IV: 0.45/0.55; BCH: 0.04/0.13) considering the percentage of ECGs linked to mortality (1-yr/5-yr, Code-15: 1.2%/3.4%; MIMIC-IV: 14.8%/24.5%; BCH: 0.9%/4.8%). Contrasting with Deep-Survival-Analysis models, classifier-based AI-ECG models exhibit significant, site-dependent sensitivity to the choice of time horizon (median Pearson's R, Code-15: 0.69, p<1E-5; MIMIC-IV: -0.80 p<1E-5). Demographic-only models perform surprisingly well on Code-15. Concordance drops 0.03-0.24 on external validation. We recommend Deep-Survival-Analysis over Classifier-Cox approaches and the inclusion of demographic covariates in ECG survival modeling. Comparisons to demographic-only and baseline models is crucial. External evaluations support fine-tuning models on site-specific data.

Title: Constant Modulus Waveform Design with Space-Time Sidelobe Reduction for DFRC Systems
Authors: Byunghyun Lee, Anindya Bijoy Das, David Love, Christopher Brinton, James Krogmeier
Abstract: Dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) is a key enabler of location-based services for next-generation communication systems. In this paper, we investigate the problem of designing constant modulus waveforms for DFRC systems. We consider the joint optimization of the spatial beam pattern and space-time correlation levels for better separating multiple targets in different angle and delay bins. In particular, we use the space-time correlation function to quantify the correlations between different angle and delay bins and formulate integrated sidelobe levels (ISLs). To serve communication users, we employ constructive interference (CI)-based precoding to modulate information symbols, which leverages distortion induced by multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) and radar transmission. We propose two solution algorithms based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and majorization-minimization (MM) principles, which are effective for small and large block sizes, respectively. The proposed ADMM-based solution decomposes the nonconvex formulated problem into multiple tractable subproblems, each of which admits a closed-form solution. To accelerate convergence of the MM-based solution, we propose a novel majorizing function for complex quadratic functions. After majorization, we decompose the approximated problem into independent subproblems for parallelization, mitigating the complexity that increases with block size. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in comparison to the existing DFRC algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods can substantially enhance the detection and estimation performance due to reduced space-time correlation levels.

Title: CRC-Assisted Channel Codes for Integrated Passive Sensing and Communications
Authors: Chenghong Bian, Kaitao Meng, Huihui Wu, Yumeng Zhang, Deniz Gunduz
Abstract: We propose a novel coded integrated passive sensing and communication (CIPSAC) system with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), where a multi-antenna base station (BS) passively senses the parameters of the targets and decodes the information bit sequences transmitted by a user. The transmitted signal is comprised of pilot and data OFDM symbols where the data symbols adopt cyclic redundancy check (CRC)-assisted channel codes to facilitate both the decoding and sensing procedures. In the proposed scheme, CRC not only enhances the reliability of communication but also provides guidance to the parameter sensing procedure at the BS. In particular, a novel iterative parameter sensing and channel decoding (IPSCD) algorithm is proposed, where the correctly decoded codewords that pass CRC are utilized for sensing to improve the parameter estimation accuracy, and in return, more accurate parameter estimates lead to a larger number of correctly decoded data symbols. Conventional sensing algorithms rely only on the received pilot signals, while we utilize both the data and pilot signals for sensing. We provide a detailed analysis of the optimal strategy, in which the wrongly decoded data packets are replaced by zero codewords. To further improve the performance, we introduce learning-based near-orthogonal superposition (NOS) codes, which exhibit superior error correction capability especially in the short block length regime. NOS codes are trained using a weighted loss function, where a hyper parameter is introduced to balance the sensing and the communication losses. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed CIPSAC system and the IPSCD algorithm, where both the sensing and decoding performances are significantly improved with a few iterations. We also carry out extensive ablation studies for a comprehensive understanding of the proposed scheme.

Title: Learning the Frequency Dynamics of the Power System Using Higher-order Dynamic Mode Decomposition
Authors: Xiao Li, Xinyi Wen, Benjamin Schäfer
Abstract: The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources, characterised by low inertia and intermittent disturbances, presents substantial challenges to power system stability. As critical indicators of system stability, frequency dynamics and associated oscillatory phenomena have attracted significant research attention. While existing studies predominantly employ linearized models, our findings demonstrate that linear approximations exhibit considerable errors when predicting frequency oscillation dynamics across multiple time scales, thus necessitating the incorporation of nonlinear characteristics. This paper proposes a data-driven approach based on higher-order dynamical mode decomposition (HODMD) for learning frequency dynamics. The proposed method offers distinct advantages over alternative nonlinear methods, including no prior knowledge required, adaptability to high-dimensional systems, and robust performance. Furthermore, HODMD demonstrates superior capability in capturing system-wide spatio-temporal modes, successfully identifying modal behaviour that remains undetectable through standard Dynamic Mode Decomposition techniques. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is validated through comprehensive case studies on both IEEE 14-bus and WECC systems.

Title: Improving Rare-Word Recognition of Whisper in Zero-Shot Settings
Authors: Yash Jogi, Vaibhav Aggarwal, Shabari S Nair, Yash Verma, Aayush Kubba
Abstract: Whisper, despite being trained on 680K hours of web-scaled audio data, faces difficulty in recognising rare words like domain-specific terms, with a solution being contextual biasing through prompting. To improve upon this method, in this paper, we propose a supervised learning strategy to fine-tune Whisper for contextual biasing instruction. We demonstrate that by using only 670 hours of Common Voice English set for fine-tuning, our model generalises to 11 diverse open-source English datasets, achieving a 45.6% improvement in recognition of rare words and 60.8% improvement in recognition of words unseen during fine-tuning over the baseline method. Surprisingly, our model's contextual biasing ability generalises even to languages unseen during fine-tuning.

Title: A Unified Algorithmic Framework for Dynamic Compressive Sensing
Authors: Xiaozhi Liu, Yong Xia
Abstract: We propose a unified dynamic tracking algorithmic framework (PLAY-CS) to reconstruct signal sequences with their intrinsic structured dynamic sparsity. By capitalizing on specific statistical assumptions concerning the dynamic filter of the signal sequences, the proposed framework exhibits versatility by encompassing various existing dynamic compressive sensing (DCS) algorithms. This is achieved through the incorporation of a newly proposed Partial-Laplacian filtering sparsity model, tailored to capture a more sophisticated dynamic sparsity. In practical scenarios such as dynamic channel tracking in wireless communications, the framework demonstrates enhanced performance compared to existing DCS algorithms.

Title: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis with Missing Modality: A Knowledge-Transfer Approach
Authors: Weide Liu, Huijing Zhan, Hao Chen, Fengmao Lv
Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis aims to identify the emotions expressed by individuals through visual, language, and acoustic cues. However, most of the existing research efforts assume that all modalities are available during both training and testing, making their algorithms susceptible to the missing modality scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge-transfer network to translate between different modalities to reconstruct the missing audio modalities. Moreover, we develop a cross-modality attention mechanism to retain the maximal information of the reconstructed and observed modalities for sentiment prediction. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate significant improvements over baselines and achieve comparable results to the previous methods with complete multi-modality supervision.

Title: Performance Analysis of Near-Field Sensing in Wideband MIMO Systems
Authors: Zhaolin Wang, Xidong Mu, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: The performance of near-field sensing (NISE) in a legacy wideband multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) communication system is analyzed. The maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) for the target's distance and angle relative to the antenna array are derived. To evaluate the estimation error, closed-form analytical expressions of Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) are derived for both uniform linear arrays (ULAs) and uniform circular arrays (UCAs). The asymptotic CRBs are then analyzed to reveal the scaling laws of CRBs with respect to key system parameters, including array size, bandwidth, and target distance. Our results reveal that 1) the mean-squared error achieved by MLEs approaches CRBs in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime; 2) a larger array aperture does not necessarily improve NISE performance, especially with ultra-large bandwidth; 3) large bandwidth sets an estimation error ceiling for NISE as target distance increases; 4) array aperture and bandwidth, rather than the number of antennas and subcarriers, are the key factors affecting wideband NISE performance; and 5) UCAs offer superior, angle-independent wideband NISE performance compared to ULAs with the same aperture.

Title: Continuous-Aperture Array (CAPA)-Based Wireless Communications: Capacity Characterization
Authors: Boqun Zhao, Chongjun Ouyang, Xingqi Zhang, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: The capacity limits of continuous-aperture array (CAPA)-based wireless communications are characterized. To this end, an analytically tractable transmission framework is established for both uplink and downlink CAPA systems. Based on this framework, closed-form expressions for the single-user channel capacity are derived. The results are further extended to a multiuser case by characterizing the capacity limits of a two-user channel and proposing the associated capacity-achieving decoding and encoding schemes. In the uplink case, the capacity-achieving detectors and sum-rate capacity are derived, and the capacity region is characterized. In the downlink case, the uplink-downlink duality is established by deriving the uplink-to-downlink and downlink-to-uplink transformations under the same power constraint, based on which the optimal source current distributions and the achieved sum-rate capacity and capacity region are characterized. For comparison, the uplink and downlink sum-rates achieved by the linear zero-forcing scheme are also analyzed. To gain further insights, several case studies are presented by specializing the derived results into various array structures, including the planar CAPA, linear CAPA, and planar spatially discrete array (SPDA). Numerical results are provided to reveal that the channel capacity achieved by CAPAs converges towards a finite upper bound as the aperture size increases; and CAPAs offer superior capacity over the conventional SPDAs.

Title: Reconstructing physiological signals from fMRI across the adult lifespan
Authors: Shiyu Wang, Ziyuan Xu, Laurent M. Lochard, Yamin Li, Jiawen Fan, Jingyuan E. Chen, Yuankai Huo, Mara Mather, Roza G. Bayrak, Catie Chang
Abstract: Interactions between the brain and body are of fundamental importance for human behavior and health. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) captures whole-brain activity noninvasively, and modeling how fMRI signals interact with physiological dynamics of the body can provide new insight into brain function and offer potential biomarkers of disease. However, physiological recordings are not always possible to acquire since they require extra equipment and setup, and even when they are, the recorded physiological signals may contain substantial artifacts. To overcome this limitation, machine learning models have been proposed to directly extract features of respiratory and cardiac activity from resting-state fMRI signals. To date, such work has been carried out only in healthy young adults and in a pediatric population, leaving open questions about the efficacy of these approaches on older adults. Here, we propose a novel framework that leverages Transformer-based architectures for reconstructing two key physiological signals - low-frequency respiratory volume (RV) and heart rate (HR) fluctuations - from fMRI data, and test these models on a dataset of individuals aged 36-89 years old. Our framework outperforms previously proposed approaches (attaining median correlations between predicted and measured signals of r ~ .698 for RV and r ~ .618 for HR), indicating the potential of leveraging attention mechanisms to model fMRI-physiological signal relationships. We also evaluate several model training and fine-tuning strategies, and find that incorporating young-adult data during training improves the performance when predicting physiological signals in the aging cohort. Overall, our approach successfully infers key physiological variables directly from fMRI data from individuals across a wide range of the adult lifespan.

Title: Towards Homogeneous Lexical Tone Decoding from Heterogeneous Intracranial Recordings
Authors: Di Wu, Siyuan Li, Chen Feng, Lu Cao, Yue Zhang, Jie Yang, Mohamad Sawan
Abstract: Recent advancements in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have enabled the decoding of lexical tones from intracranial recordings, offering the potential to restore the communication abilities of speech-impaired tonal language speakers. However, data heterogeneity induced by both physiological and instrumental factors poses a significant challenge for unified invasive brain tone decoding. Traditional subject-specific models, which operate under a heterogeneous decoding paradigm, fail to capture generalized neural representations and cannot effectively leverage data across subjects. To address these limitations, we introduce Homogeneity-Heterogeneity Disentangled Learning for neural Representations (H2DiLR), a novel framework that disentangles and learns both the homogeneity and heterogeneity from intracranial recordings across multiple subjects. To evaluate H2DiLR, we collected stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) data from multiple participants reading Mandarin materials comprising 407 syllables, representing nearly all Mandarin characters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that H2DiLR, as a unified decoding paradigm, significantly outperforms the conventional heterogeneous decoding approach. Furthermore, we empirically confirm that H2DiLR effectively captures both homogeneity and heterogeneity during neural representation learning.

Title: Adaptive Compressive Tactile Subsampling: Enabling High Spatiotemporal Resolution in Scalable Robotic Skin
Authors: Ariel Slepyan, Dian Li, Aidan Aug, Sriramana Sankar, Trac Tran, Nitish Thakor
Abstract: Robots, like humans, require full-body, high-resolution tactile sensing to operate safely and effectively in unstructured environments, enabling reflexive responses and closed-loop control. However, the high pixel counts necessary for dense, large-area coverage limit readout rates of most tactile arrays to below 100 Hz, hindering their use in high-speed tasks. We introduce Adaptive Compressive Tactile Subsampling (ACTS), a scalable and data-driven method that dramatically enhances the performance of traditional tactile matrices by leveraging sparse recovery and a learned tactile dictionary. Tested on a 1024-pixel tactile sensor array (32X32), ACTS achieved frame rates up to 1,000 Hz, an 18X improvement over conventional raster scanning, with minimal reconstruction error. For the first time, ACTS enables wearable, large-area, high-density tactile sensing systems that can deliver high-speed results. We demonstrate rapid object classification within 20 ms of contact, high-speed projectile detection, ricochet angle estimation, and soft deformation tracking, in tactile and robotics applications, all using flexible, high-density tactile arrays. These include high-resolution tactile gloves, pressure insoles, and full-body configurations covering robotic arms and human-sized mannequins. ACTS transforms standard, low-cost, and robust tactile sensors into high-speed systems, supporting applications from object manipulation to human-robot interaction. By enabling comprehensive, scalable, and efficient tactile coverage for robots and wearables, ACTS advances robotics toward lifelike, responsive, and adaptable operation in dynamic environments.

Title: Incentive-based Platoon Formation: Optimizing the Personal Benefit for Drivers
Authors: Julian Heinovski, Doğanalp Ergenç, Kirsten Thommes, Falko Dressler
Abstract: Platooning or cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) has been investigated for decades, but debate about its lasting impact is still ongoing. Even though platooning benefits and platoon formation are rather well understood for trucks, this is less clear for passenger cars, which have a higher heterogeneity in trips and drivers' preferences. Most importantly, it remains unclear how to form platoons of passenger cars in order to optimize the personal benefit for the individual driver. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel platoon formation algorithm that optimizes the personal benefit for drivers of individual passenger cars. For computing vehicle-to-platoon assignments, the algorithm utilizes a new metric that we propose to evaluate the personal benefits of various driving systems, including platooning. By combining fuel and travel time costs into a single monetary value, drivers can estimate overall trip costs according to a personal monetary value for time spent. This provides an intuitive way for drivers to understand and compare the benefits of driving systems like human driving, adaptive cruise control (ACC), and, of course, platooning. Unlike previous similarity-based methods, our proposed algorithm forms platoons only when beneficial for the driver, rather than for the sake of platooning only. Results of a large-scale simulation study demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms normal ACC as well as previous similarity-based platooning approaches by balancing fuel savings and travel time, independent of traffic and drivers' time cost.

Title: Optimal Beamforming for Multi-User Continuous Aperture Array (CAPA) Systems
Authors: Zhaolin Wang, Chongjun Ouyang, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: The optimal beamforming design for multi-user continuous aperture array (CAPA) systems is proposed. In contrast to conventional spatially discrete array (SPDA), the beamformer for CAPA is a continuous function rather than a discrete vector or matrix, rendering beamforming optimization a non-convex integral-based functional programming. To address this challenging issue, the closed-form optimal structure of the CAPA beamformer is first derived for maximizing generic system utility functions, by addressing the inversion of continuous functions and using the Lagrangian duality and the calculus of variations. The derived optimal structure is a linear combination of the continuous channel responses for CAPA, with the linear weights determined by the channel correlations. As a further advance, a monotonic optimization method is proposed for obtaining globally optimal CAPA beamforming based on the derived optimal structure. More particularly, a closed-form fixed-point iteration is proposed to obtain the globally optimal solution to the power minimization problem for CAPA beamforming. Furthermore, based on the optimal structure, the low-complexity maximum ratio transmission (MRT), zero-forcing (ZF), and minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) designs for CAPA beamforming are derived. It is theoretically proved that: 1) the MRT and ZF designs are asymptotically optimal in low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes, respectively, and 2) the MMSE design is optimal for signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio (SLNR) maximization. Our numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed designs and reveal that: i) CAPA achieves significant communication performance gain over SPDA, and ii) the MMSE design achieves nearly optimal performance in most cases, while the MRT and ZF designs achieve nearly optimal performance in specific cases

Title: Graph Adapter of EEG Foundation Models for Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning
Authors: Toyotaro Suzumura, Hiroki Kanezashi, Shotaro Akahori
Abstract: In diagnosing neurological disorders from electroencephalography (EEG) data, foundation models such as Transformers have been employed to capture temporal dynamics. Additionally, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are critical for representing the spatial relationships among EEG sensors. However, fine-tuning these large-scale models for both temporal and spatial features can be prohibitively large in computational cost, especially under the limited availability of labeled EEG datasets. We propose EEG-GraphAdapter (EGA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approach designed to address these challenges. EGA is integrated into a pre-trained temporal backbone model as a GNN-based module, freezing the backbone and allowing only the adapter to be fine-tuned. This enables the effective acquisition of EEG spatial representations, significantly reducing computational overhead and data requirements. Experimental evaluations on two healthcare-related downstream tasks-Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Abnormality Detection (TUAB)-show that EGA improves performance by up to 16.1% in F1-score compared with the backbone BENDR model, highlighting its potential for scalable and accurate EEG-based predictions.

Authors: Yifan Gao, Long Guo, Hong Liu
Abstract: Cognitive impairment detection through spontaneous speech is a promising avenue for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), where timely intervention can significantly improve patient outcomes. The PROCESS Grand Challenge at ICASSP 2025 addresses these tasks by promoting innovative classification and regression methods for detecting cognitive decline. In this paper, we propose a multimodal fusion strategy that combines interpretable linguistic features with temporal embeddings extracted from pre-trained models. Our approach achieves an F1-score of 0.649 for the classification task (predicting healthy, MCI, dementia) and an RMSE of 2.628 for the regression task (MMSE score prediction), securing the top overall ranking in the competition.

Title: VoxEval: Benchmarking the Knowledge Understanding Capabilities of End-to-End Spoken Language Models
Authors: Wenqian Cui, Xiaoqi Jiao, Ziqiao Meng, Irwin King
Abstract: With the rising need for speech-based interaction models, end-to-end Spoken Language Models (SLMs) have emerged as a promising solution. While these models require comprehensive world knowledge for meaningful and reliable human interactions, existing question-answering (QA) benchmarks fall short in evaluating SLMs' knowledge understanding due to their inability to support end-to-end speech evaluation and account for varied input audio conditions. To address these limitations, we present VoxEval, a novel SpeechQA benchmark that assesses SLMs' knowledge understanding through pure speech interactions. Our benchmark 1) uniquely maintains speech format for both inputs and outputs, 2) evaluates model robustness across diverse input audio conditions, and 3) pioneers the assessment of complex tasks like mathematical reasoning in spoken format. Systematic evaluation demonstrates that VoxEval presents significant challenges to current SLMs, revealing their sensitivity to varying audio conditions and highlighting the need to enhance reasoning capabilities in future development. We hope this benchmark could guide the advancement of more sophisticated and reliable SLMs.\footnote{VoxEval dataset is available at: this https URL

Title: A New Paradigm in Tuning Learned Indexes: A Reinforcement Learning Enhanced Approach
Authors: Taiyi Wang, Liang Liang, Guang Yang, Thomas Heinis, Eiko Yoneki
Abstract: Learned Index Structures (LIS) have significantly advanced data management by leveraging machine learning models to optimize data indexing. However, designing these structures often involves critical trade-offs, making it challenging for both designers and end-users to find an optimal balance tailored to specific workloads and scenarios. While some indexes offer adjustable parameters that demand intensive manual tuning, others rely on fixed configurations based on heuristic auto-tuners or expert knowledge, which may not consistently deliver optimal performance. This paper introduces LITune, a novel framework for end-to-end automatic tuning of Learned Index Structures. LITune employs an adaptive training pipeline equipped with a tailor-made Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to ensure stable and efficient tuning. To accommodate long-term dynamics arising from online tuning, we further enhance LITune with an on-the-fly updating mechanism termed the O2 system. These innovations allow LITune to effectively capture state transitions in online tuning scenarios and dynamically adjust to changing data distributions and workloads, marking a significant improvement over other tuning methods. Our experimental results demonstrate that LITune achieves up to a 98% reduction in runtime and a 17-fold increase in throughput compared to default parameter settings given a selected Learned Index instance. These findings highlight LITune's effectiveness and its potential to facilitate broader adoption of LIS in real-world applications.

Abstract: Real-time speech interaction, serving as a fundamental interface for human-machine collaboration, holds immense potential. However, current open-source models face limitations such as high costs in voice data collection, weakness in dynamic control, and limited intelligence. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Step-Audio, the first production-ready open-source solution. Key contributions include: 1) a 130B-parameter unified speech-text multi-modal model that achieves unified understanding and generation, with the Step-Audio-Chat version open-sourced; 2) a generative speech data engine that establishes an affordable voice cloning framework and produces the open-sourced lightweight Step-Audio-TTS-3B model through distillation; 3) an instruction-driven fine control system enabling dynamic adjustments across dialects, emotions, singing, and RAP; 4) an enhanced cognitive architecture augmented with tool calling and role-playing abilities to manage complex tasks effectively. Based on our new StepEval-Audio-360 evaluation benchmark, Step-Audio achieves state-of-the-art performance in human evaluations, especially in terms of instruction following. On open-source benchmarks like LLaMA Question, shows 9.3% average performance improvement, demonstrating our commitment to advancing the development of open-source multi-modal language technologies.
