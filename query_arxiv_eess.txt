Title: Koopman Spectral Analysis and System Identification for Stochastic Dynamical Systems via Yosida Approximation of Generators
Authors: Jun Zhou, Yiming Meng, Jun Liu
Abstract: System identification and Koopman spectral analysis are crucial for uncovering physical laws and understanding the long-term behaviour of stochastic dynamical systems governed by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). In this work, we propose a novel method for estimating the Koopman generator of systems of SDEs, based on the theory of resolvent operators and the Yosida approximation. This enables both spectral analysis and accurate estimation and reconstruction of system parameters. The proposed approach relies on only mild assumptions about the system and effectively avoids the error amplification typically associated with direct numerical differentiation. It remains robust even under low sampling rates or with only a single observed trajectory, reliably extracting dominant spectral modes and dynamic features. We validate our method on two simple systems and compare it with existing techniques as benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and improved performance of our approach in system parameter estimation, spectral mode extraction, and overall robustness.

Title: Scalable Two-Stage Stochastic Optimal Power Flow via Separable Approximation
Authors: Shishir Lamichhane, Abodh Poudyal, Bala Krishnamoorthy, Anamika Dubey
Abstract: This paper proposes a Separable Projective Approximation Routine-Optimal Power Flow (SPAR-OPF) framework for solving two-stage stochastic optimization problems in power systems. The framework utilizes a separable piecewise linear approximation of the value function and learns the function based on sample sub-gradient information. We present two formulations to model the learned value function, and compare their effectiveness. Additionally, an efficient statistical method is introduced to assess the quality of the obtained solutions. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated using distributed generation siting and sizing problem in three-phase unbalanced power distribution systems as an example. Results show that the framework approximates the value function with over 98% accuracy and provides high-quality solutions with an optimality gap of less than 1%. The framework scales efficiently with system size, generating high-quality solutions in a short time when applied to a 9500-node distribution system with 1200 scenarios, while the extensive formulations and progressive hedging failed to solve the problem.

Title: Probability of collision in nonlinear dynamics by moment propagation
Authors: Th√©o Verhelst, Giacomo Acciarini, Dario Izzo, Francesco Biscani
Abstract: Estimating the probability of collision between spacecraft is crucial for risk management and collision-avoidance strategies. Current methods often rely on Gaussian assumptions and simplifications, which can be inaccurate in highly nonlinear scenarios. This paper presents a general and efficient approach for computing collision probabilities without relying on such assumptions. Using high-order multivariate Taylor polynomials, we propagate statistical moments of initial uncertainties to the point of closest approach between the spacecraft. To compute the probability of collision, we derive a semi-analytical expression for the probability density function (PDF) of the closest approach distance, inferred from the propagated moments using orthogonal polynomials. Tested on various short-term and long-term encounters in low-Earth orbit, our method accurately handles nonlinear dynamics, non-Gaussian uncertainties, and irregular distributions. This versatile framework advances space situational awareness by providing precise collision probability estimates in complex dynamical environments. Moreover, our methodology applies to any dynamical system with uncertainty in its initial state and is therefore not restricted to collision probability estimation.

Title: Data Assimilation-based Simultaneous Phase-Resolved Ocean Wave and Ship Motion Forecast
Authors: Guangyao Wang, Yulin Pan
Abstract: This paper presents a data-assimilation (DA)-based approach to forecast the phase-resolved wave evolution process and ship motion, which is developed by coupling the high-order spectral method (HOS), ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), and a Cummins-equation-based ship model (CMI). With the developed EnKF-HOS-CMI method, the observation data for wave, ship, or both can be incorporated into the model, therefore producing the optimal analysis results. The developed method is validated and tested based on a synthetic problem on the motions of an irregular wave field and a box-shaped free-floating ship. We show that the EnKF-HOS-CMI method achieves much higher accuracy in the long-term simulation of nonlinear phase-resolved wave field and ship motion in comparison with the HOS-CMI method. Also, the ship parameters are estimated accurately by using a parameter-augmented state space in EnKF.

Title: Access Probability Optimization in RACH: A Multi-Armed Bandits Approach
Authors: Ahmed O. Elmeligy, Ioannis Psaromiligkos, Au Minh
Abstract: The use of cellular networks for massive machine-type communications (mMTC) is an appealing solution due to the availability of the existing infrastructure. However, the massive number of user equipments (UEs) poses a significant challenge to the cellular network's random access channel (RACH) regarding congestion and overloading. To mitigate this problem, we first present a novel approach to model a two-priority RACH, which allows us to define access patterns that describe the random access behavior of UEs as observed by the base station (BS). A non-uniform preamble selection scheme is proposed, offering increased flexibility in resource allocation for different UE priority classes. Then, we formulate an allocation model that finds the optimal access probabilities to maximize the success rate of high-priority UEs while constraining low-priority UEs. Finally, we develop a reinforcement learning approach to solving the optimization problem using multi-armed bandits, which provides a near-optimal but scalable solution and does not require the BS to know the number of UEs in the network.

Title: 6G WavesFM: A Foundation Model for Sensing, Communication, and Localization
Authors: Ahmed Aboulfotouh, Elsayed Mohammed, Hatem Abou-Zeid
Abstract: This paper introduces WavesFM, a novel Wireless Foundation Model (WFM) framework, capable of supporting a wide array of communication, sensing, and localization tasks. Our proposed architecture combines a shared Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone with task-specific multi-layer perceptron (MLP) heads and incorporates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. This design promotes full parameter sharing across tasks, significantly reducing the computational and memory footprint without sacrificing performance. The model processes both image-like wireless modalities, such as spectrograms and channel state information (CSI), and in-phase and quadrature (IQ) signals arranged as orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) resource grids. We demonstrate the strong generalization capabilities of WavesFM through extensive experiments on four downstream tasks: Fifth Generation New Radio (5G NR) positioning; multiple-input multiple-output OFDM (MIMO-OFDM) channel estimation; human activity sensing; and radio-frequency (RF) signal classification. Compared to supervised baselines trained individually, our approach achieves superior performance while sharing 80% of its parameters across tasks. Furthermore, we show that pretraining on domain-relevant data not only boosts performance but also accelerates convergence, reducing training time by up to 5x. These results demonstrate that our unified WFM can support diverse tasks and deliver significant gains in both performance and efficiency, highlighting the transformative potential of foundation models to drive AI-native paradigms in future sixth-generation (6G) networks.

Training, development, and evaluation datasets were provided along with a baseline attacker. Participants developed their attacker systems in the form of automatic speaker verification systems and submitted their scores on the development and evaluation data. The best attacker systems reduced the equal error rate (EER) by 25-44% relative w.r.t. the baseline.

Title: Phase tomography with axial structured illumination
Authors: N Goyal, K Khare
Abstract: Holographic Tomography (HT) or Optical Diffraction Tomography (ODT) provides slice-by-slice information about the refractive index (RI) of three-dimensional (3D) samples and is emerging as an important label-free imaging modality for Life sciences. HT systems go beyond the digital holographic microscopy (DHM) systems that provide a two-dimensional (2D) representation of the total accumulated phase acquired by a plane beam on transmission through a 3D sample. While the early HT systems used a direct reconstruction methodology based on the Fourier diffraction theorem, in recent years, there has been an increasing shift towards using iterative optimization frameworks for solving the 3D RI reconstruction problem. Despite this algorithmic framework shift, the HT system hardware still largely uses the multi-angle illumination geometries that were suitable for reconstructions based on the Fourier diffraction theorem. The present work examines the possibility of HT reconstruction through the use of on-axis structured illumination(s) that nominally illuminates the 3D sample along the axial direction. Through a simulation study, it is shown that a cross-talk free slice-by-slice 3D RI reconstruction of the sample is possible in this case via the use of sparsity penalties if the slice-to-slice distance obeys a design curve based on the notion of effective depth of focus. The simulation results for two-, three- and four-slice 3D objects with laterally overlapping features clearly outline the separate roles played by the slice-to-slice de-correlation of the field propagating through the 3D sample and that of the sparsity penalty used to guide the iterative solution. Our results suggest the possibility of realizing an Axial Structured Illumination Tomography (ASIT) system configuration that avoids the use of hardware-intensive multi-angle illumination geometry.

Title: An Artificial Intelligence Enabled Signature Estimation of Dual Wideband Systems in Ultra-Low Signal-to-Noise Ratio
Authors: Chandrashekhar Rai, Debarati Sen
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems encounter both spatial wideband spreading and temporal wideband effects in the communication channels of individual users. Accurate estimation of a user's channel signature -- specifically, the direction of arrival and time of arrival -- is crucial for designing efficient beamforming transceivers, especially under noisy observations. In this work, we propose an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled framework for estimating the channel signature of a user's location in mmWave massive MIMO systems. Our approach explicitly accounts for spatial wideband spreading, finite basis leakage effects, and significant unknown receiver noise. We demonstrate the effectiveness of a denoising convolutional neural network with residual learning for recovering channel responses, even when channel gains are of extremely low amplitude and embedded in ultra-high receiver noise environments. Notably, our method successfully recovers spatio-temporal diversity branches at signal-to-noise ratios as low as -20 dB. Furthermore, we introduce a local gravitation-based clustering algorithm to infer the number of physical propagation paths (unknown a priori) and to identify their respective support in the delay-angle domain of the denoised response. To complement our approach, we design tailored metrics for evaluating denoising and clustering performance within the context of wireless communications. We validate our framework through system-level simulations using Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) with a Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) modulation scheme over mmWave fading channels, highlighting the necessity and robustness of the proposed methods in ultra-low SNR scenarios.

Title: A Real-time and Hardware Efficient Artfecat-free Spike Sorting Using Deep Spike Detection
Authors: Xiaoyu Jiang, Tao Fang, Majid Zamani
Abstract: Spike sorting is a valuable tool in understanding brain regions. It assigns detected spike waveforms to their origins, helping to research the mechanism of the human brain and the development of implantable brain-machine interfaces (iBMIs). The presence of noise and artefacts will adversely affect the efficacy of spike sorting. This paper proposes a framework for low-cost and real-time implementation of deep spike detection, which consists of two one-dimensional (1-D) convolutional neural network (CNN) model for channel selection and artefact removal. The framework utilizes simulation and hardware layers, and it applies several low-power techniques to optimise the implementation cost of a 1-D CNN model. A compact CNN model with 210 bytes memory size is achieved using structured pruning, network projection and quantization in the simulation layer. The hardware layer also accommodates various techniques including a customized multiply-accumulate (MAC) engine, novel fused layers in the convolution pipeline and proposing flexible resource allocation for a power-efficient and low-delay design. The optimized 1-D CNN significantly decreases both computational complexity and model size, with only a minimal reduction in accuracy. Classification of 1-D CNN on the Cyclone V 5CSEMA5F31C6 FPGA evaluation platform is accomplished in just 16.8 microseconds at a frequency of 2.5 MHz. The FPGA prototype achieves an accuracy rate of 97.14% on a standard dataset and operates with a power consumption of 2.67mW from a supply voltage of 1.1 volts. An accuracy of 95.05% is achieved with a power of 5.6mW when deep spike detection is implemented using two optimized 1-D CNNs on an FPGA board.

Title: Exploiting Symmetric Non-Convexity for Multi-Objective Symbol-Level DFRC Signal Design
Authors: Ly V. Nguyen, Rang Liu, Nhan Thanh Nguyen, Markku Juntti, Bj√∂rn Ottersten, A. Lee Swindlehurst
Abstract: Symbol-level precoding (SLP) is a promising solution for addressing the inherent interference problem in dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) signal designs. This paper considers an SLP-DFRC signal design problem which optimizes the radar performance under communication performance constraints. We show that a common phase modulation applied to the transmit signals from an antenna array does not affect the performance of different radar sensing metrics, including beampattern similarity, signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), and Cram√©r-Rao lower bound (CRLB). We refer to this as symmetric-rotation invariance, upon which we develop low-complexity yet efficient DFRC signal design algorithms. More specifically, we propose a symmetric non-convexity (SNC)-based DFRC algorithm that relies on the non-convexity of the radar sensing metrics to identify a set of radar-only solutions. Based on these solutions, we further exploit the symmetry property of the radar sensing metrics to efficiently design the DFRC signal. We show that the proposed SNC-based algorithm is versatile in the sense that it can be applied to the DFRC signal optimization of all three sensing metrics mentioned above (beampattern, SINR, and CRLB). In addition, since the radar sensing metrics are independent of the communication channel and data symbols, the set of radar-only solutions can be constructed offline, thereby reducing the computational complexity. We also develop an accelerated SNC-based algorithm that further reduces the complexity. Finally, we numerically demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms compared to existing methods in terms of sensing and communication performance as well as computational requirements.

Title: Koopman-Based Event-Triggered Control from Data
Authors: Zeyad M. Manaa, Ayman M. Abdallah, Mohamed Ismail, Samil El Ferik
Abstract: Event-triggered Control (ETC) presents a promising paradigm for efficient resource usage in networked and embedded control systems by reducing communication instances compared to traditional time-triggered strategies. This paper introduces a novel approach to ETC for discrete-time nonlinear systems using a data-driven framework. By leveraging Koopman operator theory, the nonlinear system dynamics are globally linearized (approximately in practical settings) in a higher-dimensional space. We design a state-feedback controller and an event-triggering policy directly from data, ensuring exponential stability in Lyapunov sense. The proposed method is validated through extensive simulation experiments, demonstrating significant resource savings.

Title: Iterative Polynomial Approximation Algorithms for Inverse Graph Filters
Authors: Cheng Cheng, Qiyu Sun, Cong Zheng
Abstract: Chebyshev interpolation polynomials exhibit the exponential approximation property to analytic functions on a cube. Based on the Chebyshev interpolation polynomial approximation, we propose iterative polynomial approximation algorithms to implement the inverse filter with a polynomial graph filter of commutative graph shifts in a distributed manner. The proposed algorithms exhibit exponential convergence properties, and they can be implemented on distributed networks in which agents are equipped with a data processing subsystem for limited data storage and computation power, and with a one-hop communication subsystem for direct data exchange only with their adjacent agents. Our simulations show that the proposed polynomial approximation algorithms may converge faster than the Chebyshev polynomial approximation algorithm and the conventional gradient descent algorithm do.

Title: Graphical Dominance Analysis for Linear Systems: A Frequency-Domain Approach
Authors: Chao Chen, Thomas Chaffey, Rodolphe Sepulchre
Abstract: We propose a frequency-domain approach to dominance analysis for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) linear time-invariant systems. The dominance of a MIMO system is defined to be the number of its poles in the open right half-plane. Our approach is graphical: we define a frequency-wise notion of the recently-introduced scaled graph of a MIMO system plotted in a complex plane. The scaled graph provides a bound of the eigenloci of the system, which can be viewed as a robust MIMO extension of the classical Nyquist plot. Our main results characterize sufficient conditions for quantifying the dominance of a closed-loop system based upon separation of scaled graphs of two open-loop systems in a frequency-wise manner. The results reconcile existing small gain, small phase and passivity theorems for feedback dominance analysis.

Title: Soft and Hard Scaled Relative Graphs for Nonlinear Feedback Stability
Authors: Chao Chen, Sei Zhen Khong, Rodolphe Sepulchre
Abstract: This paper presents input-output stability analysis of nonlinear feedback systems based on the notion of soft and hard scaled relative graphs (SRGs). The soft and hard SRGs acknowledge the distinction between incremental positivity and incremental passivity and reconcile them from a graphical perspective. The essence of our proposed analysis is that the separation of soft/hard SRGs of two open-loop systems on the complex plane guarantees closed-loop stability. The main results generalize an existing soft SRG separation theorem for bounded open-loop systems which was proved based on interconnection properties of soft SRGs under a chordal assumption. By comparison, our analysis does not require this chordal assumption and applies to possibly unbounded open-loop systems.

Title: Data Augmentation Using Neural Acoustic Fields With Retrieval-Augmented Pre-training
Authors: Christopher Ick, Gordon Wichern, Yoshiki Masuyama, Fran√ßois G. Germain, Jonathan Le Roux
Abstract: This report details MERL's system for room impulse response (RIR) estimation submitted to the Generative Data Augmentation Workshop at ICASSP 2025 for Augmenting RIR Data (Task 1) and Improving Speaker Distance Estimation (Task 2). We first pre-train a neural acoustic field conditioned by room geometry on an external large-scale dataset in which pairs of RIRs and the geometries are provided. The neural acoustic field is then adapted to each target room by using the enrollment data, where we leverage either the provided room geometries or geometries retrieved from the external dataset, depending on availability. Lastly, we predict the RIRs for each pair of source and receiver locations specified by Task 1, and use these RIRs to train the speaker distance estimation model in Task 2.

Title: Quantum-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning for Power Grid Security Assessment
Authors: Benjamin M. Peter, Mert Korkali
Abstract: The increasingly challenging task of maintaining power grid security requires innovative solutions. Novel approaches using reinforcement learning (RL) agents have been proposed to help grid operators navigate the massive decision space and nonlinear behavior of these complex networks. However, applying RL to power grid security assessment, specifically for combinatorially troublesome contingency analysis problems, has proven difficult to scale. The integration of quantum computing into these RL frameworks helps scale by improving computational efficiency and boosting agent proficiency by leveraging quantum advantages in action exploration and model-based interdependence. To demonstrate a proof-of-concept use of quantum computing for RL agent training and simulation, we propose a hybrid agent that runs on quantum hardware using IBM's Qiskit Runtime. We also provide detailed insight into the construction of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) for generating relevant quantum output. This agent's proficiency at maintaining grid stability is demonstrated relative to a benchmark model without quantum enhancement using N-k contingency analysis. Additionally, we offer a comparative assessment of the training procedures for RL models integrated with a quantum backend.

Title: Predicting speech intelligibility in older adults using the Gammachirp Envelope Similarity Index, GESI
Authors: Ayako Yamamoto, Fuki Miyazaki, Toshio Irino
Abstract: We propose an objective intelligibility measure (OIM), called the Gammachirp Envelope Similarity Index (GESI), that can predict speech intelligibility (SI) in older adults. GESI is a bottom-up model based on psychoacoustic knowledge from the peripheral to the central auditory system and requires no training data. It computes the single SI metric using the gammachirp filterbank (GCFB), the modulation filterbank, and the extended cosine similarity measure. It takes into account not only the hearing level represented in the audiogram, but also the temporal processing characteristics captured by the temporal modulation transfer function (TMTF). To evaluate performance, SI experiments were conducted with older adults of various hearing levels using speech-in-noise with ideal speech enhancement on familiarity-controlled words. The prediction performance was compared with HASPIw2, which was developed for keyword SI prediction. The results showed that GESI predicted the subjective SI scores more accurately than HASPIw2. The effect of introducing TMTF into the GESI algorithm was not significant, indicating that more research is needed to know how to introduce temporal response characteristics into the OIM.

Title: Beamforming Design and Association Scheme for Multi-RIS Multi-User mmWave Systems Through Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Mengbing Liu, Chongwen Huang, Ahmed Alhammadi, Marco Di Renzo, Merouane Debbah, Chau Yuen
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is emerging as a promising technology for next-generation wireless communication networks, offering a variety of merits such as the ability to tailor the communication environment. Moreover, deploying multiple RISs helps mitigate severe signal blocking between the base station (BS) and users, providing a practical and efficient solution to enhance the service coverage. However, fully reaping the potential of a multi-RIS aided communication system requires solving a non-convex optimization problem. This challenge motivates the adoption of learning-based methods for determining the optimal policy. In this paper, we introduce a novel heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN) to effectively leverage the graph topology of a wireless communication environment. Specifically, we design an association scheme that selects a suitable RIS for each user. Then, we maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) of all the users by iteratively optimizing the RIS association scheme, and beamforming designs until the considered heterogeneous GNN converges. Based on the proposed approach, each user is associated with the best RIS, which is shown to significantly improve the system capacity in multi-RIS multi-user millimeter wave (mmWave) communications. Specifically, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed heterogeneous GNN closely approaches the performance of the high-complexity alternating optimization (AO) algorithm in the considered multi-RIS aided communication system, and it outperforms other benchmark schemes. Moreover, the performance improvement achieved through the RIS association scheme is shown to be of the order of 30%.

Title: Online Optimal Parameter Compensation method of High-dimensional PID Controller for Robust stability
Authors: Zimao Sheng, Hong'an Yang
Abstract: Classical PID control is widely applied in an engineering system, with parameter regulation relying on a method like Trial - Error Tuning or the Ziegler - Nichols rule, mainly for a Single - Input Single - Output (SISO) system. However, the industrial nonlinear Multiple - Input Multiple - Output (MIMO) system demands a high - robustness PID controller due to strong state coupling, external disturbances, and faults. Existing research on PID parameter regulation for a nonlinear uncertain MIMO system has a significant drawback: it's limited to a specific system type, the control mechanism for a MIMO nonlinear system under disturbances is unclear, the MIMO PID controller over - relies on decoupled control, and lacks dynamic parameter compensation. This paper theoretically analyzes a high - dimensional PID controller for a disturbed nonlinear MIMO system, providing a condition for online dynamic parameter regulation to ensure robust stability. By transforming the parameter regulation into a two - stage minimum eigenvalue problem (EVP) solvable via the interior point method, it enables efficient online tuning. The experiment proves that the designed dynamic compensation algorithm can achieve online robust stability of system errors considering multi - channel input coupling, addressing the key limitation in the field.

Title: Max-Min Fairness for Stacked Intelligent Metasurface-Assisted Multi-User MISO Systems
Authors: Nipuni Ginige, Prathapasinghe Dharmawansa, Arthur Sousa de Sena, Nurul Huda Mahmood, Nandana Rajatheva, Matti Latva-aho
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) is an emerging technology that uses multiple reconfigurable surface layers to enable flexible wave-based beamforming. In this paper, we focus on an \ac{SIM}-assisted multi-user multiple-input single-output system, where it is essential to ensure that all users receive a fair and reliable service level. To this end, we develop two max-min fairness algorithms based on instantaneous channel state information (CSI) and statistical CSI. For the instantaneous CSI case, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm that jointly optimizes power allocation using geometric programming and wave-based beamforming coefficients using the gradient descent-ascent method. For the statistical CSI case, since deriving an exact expression for the average minimum achievable rate is analytically intractable, we derive a tight upper bound and thereby formulate a stochastic optimization problem. This problem is then solved, capitalizing on an alternating approach combining geometric programming and gradient descent algorithms, to obtain the optimal policies. Our numerical results show significant improvements in the minimum achievable rate compared to the benchmark schemes. In particular, for the instantaneous CSI scenario, the individual impact of the optimal wave-based beamforming is significantly higher than that of the power allocation strategy. Moreover, the proposed upper bound is shown to be tight in the low signal-to-noise ratio regime under the statistical CSI.

Title: Markovian Continuity of the MMSE
Authors: Elad Domanovitz, Anatoly Khina
Abstract: Minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation is widely used in signal processing and related fields. While it is known to be non-continuous with respect to all standard notions of stochastic convergence, it remains robust in practical applications. In this work, we review the known counterexamples to the continuity of the MMSE. We observe that, in these counterexamples, the discontinuity arises from an element in the converging measurement sequence providing more information about the estimand than the limit of the measurement sequence. We argue that this behavior is uncharacteristic of real-world applications and introduce a new stochastic convergence notion, termed Markovian convergence, to address this issue. We prove that the MMSE is, in fact, continuous under this new notion. We supplement this result with semi-continuity and continuity guarantees of the MMSE in other settings and prove the continuity of the MMSE under linear estimation.

Title: Proactive Radio Resource Allocation for 6G In-Factory Subnetworks
Authors: Hossam Farag, Mohamed Ragab, Gilberto Berardinelli, Cedomir Stefanovic
Abstract: 6G In-Factory Subnetworks (InF-S) have recently been introduced as short-range, low-power radio cells installed in robots and production modules to support the strict requirements of modern control systems. Information freshness, characterized by the Age of Information (AoI), is crucial to guarantee the stability and accuracy of the control loop in these systems. However, achieving strict AoI performance poses significant challenges considering the limited resources and the high dynamic environment of InF-S. In this work, we introduce a proactive radio resource allocation approach to minimize the AoI violation probability. The proposed approach adopts a decentralized learning framework using Bayesian Ridge Regression (BRR) to predict the future AoI by actively learning the system dynamics. Based on the predicted AoI value, radio resources are proactively allocated to minimize the probability of AoI exceeding a predefined threshold, hence enhancing the reliability and accuracy of the control loop. The conducted simulation results prove the effectiveness of our proposed approach to improve the AoI performance where a reduction of 98% is achieved in the AoI violation probability compared to relevant baseline methods.

Title: Data-driven model order reduction for T-Product-Based dynamical systems
Authors: Shenghan Mei, Ziqin He, Yidan Mei, Xin Mao, Anqi Dong, Ren Wang, Can Chen
Abstract: Model order reduction plays a crucial role in simplifying complex systems while preserving their essential dynamic characteristics, making it an invaluable tool in a wide range of applications, including robotic systems, signal processing, and fluid dynamics. However, traditional model order reduction techniques like balanced truncation are not designed to handle tensor data directly and instead require unfolding the data, which may lead to the loss of important higher-order structural information. In this article, we introduce a novel framework for data-driven model order reduction of T-product-based dynamical systems (TPDSs), which are often used to capture the evolution of third-order tensor data such as images and videos through the T-product. Specifically, we develop advanced T-product-based techniques, including T-balanced truncation, T-balanced proper orthogonal decomposition, and the T-eigensystem realization algorithm for input-output TPDSs by leveraging the unique properties of T-singular value decomposition. We demonstrate that these techniques offer significant memory and computational savings while achieving reduction errors that are comparable to those of conventional methods. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is further validated through synthetic and real-world examples.

Title: Sensor Scheduling in Intrusion Detection Games with Uncertain Payoffs
Authors: Jayanth Bhargav, Shreyas Sundaram, Mahsa Ghasemi
Abstract: We study the problem of sensor scheduling for an intrusion detection task. We model this as a two-player zero-sum game over a graph, where the defender (Player 1) seeks to identify the optimal strategy for scheduling sensor orientations to minimize the probability of missed detection at minimal cost, while the intruder (Player 2) aims to identify the optimal path selection strategy to maximize missed detection probability at minimal cost. The defender's strategy space grows exponentially with the number of sensors, making direct computation of the Nash Equilibrium (NE) strategies computationally expensive. To tackle this, we propose a distributed variant of the Weighted Majority algorithm that exploits the structure of the game's payoff matrix, enabling efficient computation of the NE strategies with provable convergence guarantees. Next, we consider a more challenging scenario where the defender lacks knowledge of the true sensor models and, consequently, the game's payoff matrix. For this setting, we develop online learning algorithms that leverage bandit feedback from sensors to estimate the NE strategies. By building on existing results from perturbation theory and online learning in matrix games, we derive high-probability order-optimal regret bounds for our algorithms. Finally, through simulations, we demonstrate the empirical performance of our proposed algorithms in both known and unknown payoff scenarios.

Title: Adaptive Field Effect Planner for Safe Interactive Autonomous Driving on Curved Roads
Authors: Qinghao Li, Zhen Tian, Xiaodan Wang, Jinming Yang, Zhihao Lin
Abstract: Autonomous driving has garnered significant attention for its potential to improve safety, traffic efficiency, and user convenience. However, the dynamic and complex nature of interactive driving poses significant challenges, including the need to navigate non-linear road geometries, handle dynamic obstacles, and meet stringent safety and comfort requirements. Traditional approaches, such as artificial potential fields (APF), often fall short in addressing these complexities independently, necessitating the development of integrated and adaptive frameworks. This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous vehicle navigation that integrates artificial potential fields, Frenet coordinates, and improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO). A dynamic risk field, adapted from traditional APF, is proposed to ensure interactive safety by quantifying risks and dynamically adjusting lane-changing intentions based on surrounding vehicle behavior. Frenet coordinates are utilized to simplify trajectory planning on non-straight roads, while an enhanced quintic polynomial trajectory generator ensures smooth and comfortable path transitions. Additionally, an IPSO algorithm optimizes trajectory selection in real time, balancing safety and user comfort within a feasible input range. The proposed framework is validated through extensive simulations and real-world scenarios, demonstrating its ability to navigate complex traffic environments, maintain safety margins, and generate smooth, dynamically feasible trajectories.

Title: Data-Driven Evolutionary Game-Based Model Predictive Control for Hybrid Renewable Energy Dispatch in Autonomous Ships
Authors: Yaoze Liu, Zhen Tian, Jinming Yang, Zhihao Lin
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a data-driven Evolutionary Game-Based Model Predictive Control (EG-MPC) framework for the energy dispatch of a hybrid renewable energy system powering an autonomous ship. The system integrates solar photovoltaic and wind turbine generation with battery energy storage and diesel backup power to ensure reliable operation. Given the uncertainties in renewable generation and dynamic energy demands, an optimal dispatch strategy is crucial to minimize operational costs while maintaining system reliability. To address these challenges, we formulate a cost minimization problem that considers both battery degradation costs and diesel fuel expenses, leveraging real-world data to enhance modeling accuracy. The EG-MPC approach integrates evolutionary game dynamics within a receding-horizon optimization framework, enabling adaptive and near-optimal control solutions in real time. Simulation results based on site-specific data demonstrate that the proposed method achieves cost-effective, reliable, and adaptive energy dispatch, outperforming conventional rule-based and standard MPC approaches, particularly under uncertainty.

Title: Delay-Angle Information Spoofing for Channel State Information-Free Location-Privacy Enhancement
Authors: Jianxiu Li, Urbashi Mitra
Abstract: In this paper, a delay-angle information spoofing (DAIS) strategy is proposed to enhance the location privacy at the physical layer. More precisely, the location-relevant delays and angles are artificially shifted without the aid of channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter, such that the location perceived by the eavesdropper is incorrect and distinct from the true one. By leveraging the intrinsic structure of the wireless channel, a precoder is designed to achieve DAIS while the legitimate localizer can remove the obfuscation via securely receiving a modest amount of information, i.e., the delay-angle shifts. A lower bound on eavesdropper's localization error is derived, revealing that location privacy is enhanced not only due to estimation error, but also by the geometric mismatch introduced by DAIS. Furthermore, the lower bound is explicitly expressed as a function of the delay-angle shifts, characterizing performance trends and providing the appropriate design of these shift parameters. The statistical hardness of maliciously inferring the delay-angle shifts by a single-antenna eavesdropper as well as the challenges for a multi-antenna eavesdropper are investigated to assess the robustness of the proposed DAIS strategy. Numerical results show that the proposed DAIS strategy results in more than 15 dB performance degradation for the eavesdropper as compared with that for the legitimate localizer at high signal-to-noise ratios, and provides more effective location-privacy enhancement than the prior art.

Abstract: In semantic segmentation, the accuracy of models heavily depends on the high-quality annotations. However, in many practical scenarios such as medical imaging and remote sensing, obtaining true annotations is not straightforward and usually requires significant human labor. Relying on human labor often introduces annotation errors, including mislabeling, omissions, and inconsistency between annotators. In the case of remote sensing, differences in procurement time can lead to misaligned ground truth annotations. These label errors are not independently distributed, and instead usually appear in spatially connected regions where adjacent pixels are more likely to share the same errors. To address these issues, we propose an approximate Bayesian estimation based on a probabilistic model that assumes training data includes label errors, incorporating the tendency for these errors to occur with spatial correlations between adjacent pixels. Bayesian inference requires computing the posterior distribution of label errors, which becomes intractable when spatial correlations are present. We represent the correlation of label errors between adjacent pixels through a Gaussian distribution whose covariance is structured by a Kac-Murdock-Szeg√∂ (KMS) matrix, solving the computational challenges. Through experiments on multiple segmentation tasks, we confirm that leveraging the spatial correlation of label errors significantly improves performance. Notably, in specific tasks such as lung segmentation, the proposed method achieves performance comparable to training with clean labels under moderate noise levels.

Title: DNN based HRIRs Identification with a Continuously Rotating Speaker Array
Authors: Byeong-Yun Ko, Deokki Min, Hyeonuk Nam, Yong-Hwa Park
Abstract: Conventional static measurement of head-related impulse responses (HRIRs) is time-consuming due to the need for repositioning a speaker array for each azimuth angle. Dynamic approaches using analytical models with a continuously rotating speaker array have been proposed, but their accuracy is significantly reduced at high rotational speeds. To address this limitation, we propose a DNN-based HRIRs identification using sequence-to-sequence learning. The proposed DNN model incorporates fully connected (FC) networks to effectively capture HRIR transitions and includes reset and update gates to identify HRIRs over a whole sequence. The model updates the HRIRs vector coefficients based on the gradient of the instantaneous square error (ISE). Additionally, we introduce a learnable normalization process based on the speaker excitation signals to stabilize the gradient scale of ISE across time. A training scheme, referred to as whole-sequence updating and optimization scheme, is also introduced to prevent overfitting. We evaluated the proposed method through simulations and experiments. Simulation results using the FABIAN database show that the proposed method outperforms previous analytic models, achieving over 7 dB improvement in normalized misalignment (NM) and maintaining log spectral distortion (LSD) below 2 dB at a rotational speed of 45¬∞/s. Experimental results with a custom-built speaker array confirm that the proposed method successfully preserved accurate sound localization cues, consistent with those from static measurement.

Title: Aligning Beam with Imbalanced Multi-modality: A Generative Federated Learning Approach
Authors: Jiahui Liang, Miaowen Wen, Shuoyao Wang, Yuxuan Liang, Shijian Gao
Abstract: As vehicle intelligence advances, multi-modal sensing-aided communication emerges as a key enabler for reliable Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) connectivity through precise environmental characterization. As centralized learning may suffer from data privacy, model heterogeneity and communication overhead issues, federated learning (FL) has been introduced to support V2X. However, the practical deployment of FL faces critical challenges: model performance degradation from label imbalance across vehicles and training instability induced by modality disparities in sensor-equipped agents. To overcome these limitations, we propose a generative FL approach for beam selection (GFL4BS). Our solution features two core innovations: 1) An adaptive zero-shot multi-modal generator coupled with spectral-regularized loss functions to enhance the expressiveness of synthetic data compensating for both label scarcity and missing modalities; 2) A hybrid training paradigm integrating feature fusion with decentralized optimization to ensure training resilience while minimizing communication costs. Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over baselines achieving 16.2% higher accuracy than the current state-of-the-art under severe label imbalance conditions while maintaining over 70% successful rate even when two agents lack both LiDAR and RGB camera inputs.

Title: Quantitative Measures for Passive Sonar Texture Analysis
Authors: Jarin Ritu, Alexandra Van Dine, Joshua Peeples
Abstract: Passive sonar signals contain complex characteristics often arising from environmental noise, vessel machinery, and propagation effects. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) perform well on passive sonar classification tasks, they can struggle with statistical variations that occur in the data. To investigate this limitation, synthetic underwater acoustic datasets are generated that centered on amplitude and period variations. Two metrics are proposed to quantify and validate these characteristics in the context of statistical and structural texture for passive sonar. These measures are applied to real-world passive sonar datasets to assess texture information in the signals and correlate the performances of the models. Results show that CNNs underperform on statistically textured signals, but incorporating explicit statistical texture modeling yields consistent improvements. These findings highlight the importance of quantifying texture information for passive sonar classification.

Title: Event triggered optimal formation control for nonlinear multi-agent systems under Denial-of-Service attacks
Authors: Jianqiang Zhang, Kaijun Yang
Abstract: This paper investigates the optimal formation control problem of a class of nonlinear multi-agent systems(MASs) under Denial-of-Service(DoS) attacks. We design the optimal formation control law using an event-triggered control scheme to achieve formation objectives under DoS attacks. Critic neural network (NN)-based approach is employed to achieve the optimal control policy under DoS attacks. Event-triggered mechanism is introduced to ensure the saving of control resources. Additionally, Lyapunov stability theory is utilized to demonstrate that the local neighborhood formation error exhibits exponential stability and the estimation error of weights are uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, the effectiveness of the control algorithm is validated through matlab simulations. The results indicate that under DoS attacks, the nonlinear MAS successfully achieves the desired formation for the MAS.

Title: Radar Code Design for the Joint Optimization of Detection Performance and Measurement Accuracy in Track Maintenance
Authors: Tao Fan, Augusto Aubry, Vincenzo Carotenuto, Antonio De Maio, Xianxiang Yu, Guolong Cui
Abstract: This paper deals with the design of slow-time coded waveforms which jointly optimize the detection probability and the measurements accuracy for track maintenance in the presence of colored Gaussian interference. The output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and Cram√©r Rao bounds (CRBs) on time delay and Doppler shift are used as figures of merit to accomplish reliable detection as well as accurate measurements. The transmitted code is subject to radar power budget requirements and a similarity constraint. To tackle the resulting non-convex multi-objective optimization problem, a polynomial-time algorithm that integrates scalarization and tensor-based relaxation methods is developed. The corresponding relaxed multi-linear problems are solved by means of the maximum block improvement (MBI) framework, where the optimal solution at each iteration is obtained in closed form. Numeral results demonstrate the trade-off between the detection and the estimation performance, along with the acceptable Doppler robustness achieved by the proposed algorithm.

Title: Distributed Time-Varying Gaussian Regression via Kalman Filtering
Authors: Nicola Taddei, Riccardo Maggioni, Jaap Eising, Giulia De Pasquale, Florian Dorfler
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning time-varying functions in a distributed fashion, where agents collect local information to collaboratively achieve a shared estimate. This task is particularly relevant in control applications, whenever real-time and robust estimation of dynamic cost/reward functions in safety critical settings has to be performed. In this paper, we,adopt a finite-dimensional approximation of a Gaussian Process, corresponding to a Bayesian linear regression in an appropriate feature space, and propose a new algorithm, DistKP, to track the time-varying coefficients via a distributed Kalman filter. The proposed method works for arbitrary kernels and under weaker assumptions on the time-evolution of the function to learn compared to the literature. We validate our results using a simulation example in which a fleet of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) learns a dynamically changing wind field.

Title: OmniAudio: Generating Spatial Audio from 360-Degree Video
Authors: Huadai Liu, Tianyi Luo, Qikai Jiang, Kaicheng Luo, Peiwen Sun, Jialei Wan, Rongjie Huang, Qian Chen, Wen Wang, Xiangtai Li, Shiliang Zhang, Zhijie Yan, Zhou Zhao, Wei Xue
Abstract: Traditional video-to-audio generation techniques primarily focus on field-of-view (FoV) video and non-spatial audio, often missing the spatial cues necessary for accurately representing sound sources in 3D environments. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel task, 360V2SA, to generate spatial audio from 360-degree videos, specifically producing First-order Ambisonics (FOA) audio - a standard format for representing 3D spatial audio that captures sound directionality and enables realistic 3D audio reproduction. We first create Sphere360, a novel dataset tailored for this task that is curated from real-world data. We also design an efficient semi-automated pipeline for collecting and cleaning paired video-audio data. To generate spatial audio from 360-degree video, we propose a novel framework OmniAudio, which leverages self-supervised pre-training using both spatial audio data (in FOA format) and large-scale non-spatial data. Furthermore, OmniAudio features a dual-branch framework that utilizes both panoramic and FoV video inputs to capture comprehensive local and global information from 360-degree videos. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance across both objective and subjective metrics on Sphere360. Code and datasets will be released at this https URL.

Title: StableQuant: Layer Adaptive Post-Training Quantization for Speech Foundation Models
Authors: Yeona Hong, Hyewon Han, Woo-jin Chung, Hong-Goo Kang
Abstract: In this paper, we propose StableQuant, a novel adaptive post-training quantization (PTQ) algorithm for widely used speech foundation models (SFMs). While PTQ has been successfully employed for compressing large language models (LLMs) due to its ability to bypass additional fine-tuning, directly applying these techniques to SFMs may not yield optimal results, as SFMs utilize distinct network architecture for feature extraction. StableQuant demonstrates optimal quantization performance regardless of the network architecture type, as it adaptively determines the quantization range for each layer by analyzing both the scale distributions and overall performance. We evaluate our algorithm on two SFMs, HuBERT and wav2vec2.0, for an automatic speech recognition (ASR) task, and achieve superior performance compared to traditional PTQ methods. StableQuant successfully reduces the sizes of SFM models to a quarter and doubles the inference speed while limiting the word error rate (WER) performance drop to less than 0.3% with 8-bit quantization.

Title: A Purely Data-Driven Adaptive Impedance Matching Method Robust to Parasitic Effects
Authors: Wendong Cheng, Li Chen, Weidong Wang
Abstract: Adaptive impedance matching between antennas and radio frequency front-end (RFFE) power modules is essential for mobile communication systems. To address the matching performance degradation caused by parasitic effects in practical tunable matching networks (TMN), this paper proposes a purely data-driven adaptive impedance matching method that avoids trial-and-error physical adjustment. First, we propose the residual enhanced circuit behavior modeling network (RECBM-Net), a deep learning model that maps TMN operating states to their scattering parameters (S-parameters). Then, we formulate the matching process based on the trained surrogate model as a mathematical optimization problem. We employ two classic numerical methods with different online computational overhead, namely simulated annealing particle swarm optimization (SAPSO) and adaptive moment estimation with automatic differentiation (AD-Adam), to search for the matching solution. To further reduce the online inference overhead caused by repeated forward propagation through RECBM-Net, we train an inverse mapping solver network (IMS-Net) to directly predict the optimal solution. Simulation results show that RECBM-Net achieves exceptionally high modeling accuracy. While AD-Adam significantly reduces computational overhead compared to SAPSO, it sacrifices slight accuracy. IMS-Net offers the lowest online overhead while maintaining excellent matching accuracy.

Title: Considerations on the Design of Transceivers for Ambient Internet of Things
Authors: Yuxiao Zhao, Zhen Shen, Shiyu Li, Jing Feng, Hao Min
Abstract: The Ambient IoT (A-IoT) will introduce trillions of connections and enable low-cost battery-less devices. The A-IoT nodes can achieve low cost ($\sim \$ 0.1$ like RFID tag), sub-1mW average power consumption, $\leq 10$ kbps data rates, maintenance-free working for decades, cm-scale size, cm-scale size, and supporting applications like supply chain and smart agriculture. The transceiver challenges in A-IoT focus on sub-mW receivers and crystal-less clock generation. The paper proposes an "approximate low-IF" receiver and "carrier-auxiliary IF feedback" LO synthesizer architecture for Type-B/C A-IoT devices, which tracks the RF carrier frequency and eliminates external crystals. The proposed receiver and LO generator are implemented using 55nm CMOS technology. After locking the LO calibration loop, the receiver sensitivity is better than -88 dBm. The proposed receiver architecture will promote "zero power" devices for ubiquitous IoT connectivity, bridging digital and physical worlds.

Title: On feature representations for marmoset vocal communication analysis
Authors: Eklavya Sarkar, Kaja Wierucka, Alexandra B. Bosshard, Judith Burkart, Mathew Magimai.-Doss
Abstract: The acoustic analysis of marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) vocalizations is often used to understand the evolutionary origins of human language. Currently, the analysis is largely carried out in a manual or semi-manual manner. Thus, there is a need to develop automatic call analysis methods. In that direction, research has been limited to the development of analysis methods with small amounts of data or for specific scenarios. Furthermore, there is lack of prior knowledge about what type of information is relevant for different call analysis tasks. To address these issues, as a first step, this paper explores different feature representation methods, namely, HCTSA-based hand-crafted features Catch22, pre-trained self supervised learning (SSL) based features extracted from neural networks trained on human speech and end-to-end acoustic modeling for call-type classification, caller identification and caller sex identification. Through an investigation on three different marmoset call datasets, we demonstrate that SSL-based feature representations and end-to-end acoustic modeling tend to lead to better systems than Catch22 features for call-type and caller classification. Furthermore, we also highlight the impact of signal bandwidth on the obtained task performances.

Title: Blinding the Wiretapper: RIS-Enabled User Occultation in the ISAC Era
Authors: Getuar Rexhepi, Hyeon Seok Rou, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, George C. Alexandropoulos
Abstract: An undesirable consequence of the foreseeable proliferation of sophisticated integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) technologies is the enabling of spoofing, by malicious agents, of situational information (such as proximity, direction or location) of legitimate users of wireless systems. In order to mitigate this threat, we present a novel ISAC scheme that, aided by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), enables the occultation of the positions of user equipment (UE) from wiretappers, while maintaining both sensing and desired communication performance between the UEs and a legitimate base station (BS). To that end, we first formulate an RIS phase-shift optimization problem that jointly maximizes the sum-rate performance of the UEs (communication objective), while minimizing the projection of the wiretapper's effective channel onto the legitimate channel (hiding objective), thereby disrupting the attempts by a wiretapper of localizing the UEs. Then, in order to efficiently solve the resulting non-convex joint optimization problem, a novel manifold optimization algorithm is derived, whose effectiveness is validated by numerical results, which demonstrate that the proposed approach preserves legitimate ISAC performance while significantly degrading the wiretapper's sensing capability.

Title: The PHD/CPHD filter for Multiple Extended Target Tracking with Trajectory Set Theory and Explicit Shape Estimation
Authors: Yuanhao Cheng, Yunhe Cao, Tat-Soon Yeo, Fu Jie, Wei Zhang
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two methods for tracking multiple extended targets or unresolved group targets with elliptical extent shape. These two methods are deduced from the famous Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filter and the Cardinality-PHD (CPHD) filter, respectively. In these two methods, Trajectory Set Theory (TST) is combined to establish the target trajectory estimates. Moreover, by employing a decoupled shape estimation model, the proposed methods can explicitly provide the shape estimation of the target, such as the orientation of the ellipse extension and the length of its two axes. We derived the closed Bayesian recursive of these two methods with stable trajectory generation and accurate extent estimation, resulting in the TPHD-E filter and the TCPHD-E filter. In addition, Gaussian mixture implementations of our methods are provided, which are further referred to as the GM-TPHD-E filter and the GM-TCPHD-E filters. We illustrate the ability of these methods through simulations and experiments with real data. These experiments demonstrate that the two proposed algorithms have advantages over existing algorithms in target shape estimation, as well as in the completeness and accuracy of target trajectory generation.

Title: Bayesian Sensing for Time-Varying Channels in ISAC Systems
Authors: Xueyang Wang, Kai Wu, J. Andrew Zhang, Shiqi Gong, Chengwen Xing
Abstract: Future mobile networks are projected to support integrated sensing and communications in high-speed communication scenarios. Nevertheless, large Doppler shifts induced by time-varying channels may cause severe inter-carrier interference (ICI). Frequency domain shows the potential of reducing ISAC complexity as compared with other domains. However, parameter mismatching issue still exists for such sensing. In this paper, we develop a novel sensing scheme based on sparse Bayesian framework, where the delay and Doppler estimation problem in time-varying channels is formulated as a 3D multiple measurement-sparse signal recovery (MM-SSR) problem. We then propose a novel two-layer variational Bayesian inference (VBI) method to decompose the 3D MM-SSR problem into two layers and estimate the Doppler in the first layer and the delay in the second layer alternatively. Subsequently, as is benefited from newly unveiled signal construction, a simplified two-stage multiple signal classification (MUSIC)-based VBI method is proposed, where the delay and the Doppler are estimated by MUSIC and VBI, respectively. Additionally, the Cram√©r-Rao bound (CRB) of the considered sensing parameters is derived to characterize the lower bound for the proposed estimators. Corroborated by extensive simulation results, our proposed method can achieve improved mean square error (MSE) than its conventional counterparts and is robust against the target number and target speed, thereby validating its wide applicability and advantages over prior arts.

Title: PID-GM: PID Control with Gain Mapping
Authors: Bo Zhu, Wei Yu, Hugh H.T. Liu
Abstract: Proportional-Integral-Differential (PID) control is widely used in industrial control systems. However, up to now there are at least two open problems related with PID control. One is to have a comprehensive understanding of its robustness with respect to model uncertainties and disturbances. The other is to build intuitive, explicit and mathematically provable guidelines for PID gain tuning. In this paper, we introduce a simple nonlinear mapping to determine PID gains from three auxiliary parameters. By the mapping, PID control is shown to be equivalent to a new PD control (serving as a nominal control) plus an uncertainty and disturbance compensator (to recover the nominal performance). Then PID control can be understood, designed and tuned in a Two-Degree-of-Freedom (2-DoF) control framework. We discuss some basic properties of the mapping, including the existence, uniqueness and invertibility. Taking as an example the PID control applied to a general uncertain second-order plant, we prove by the singular perturbation theory that the closed-loop steady-state and transient performance depends explicitly on one auxiliary parameter which can be viewed as the virtual singular perturbation parameter (SPP) of PID control. All the three PID gains are monotonically decreasing functions of the SPP, indicating that the smaller the SPP is, the higher the PID gains are, and the better the robustness of PID control is. Simulation and experimental examples are provided to demonstrate the properties of the mapping as well as the effectiveness of the mapping based PID gain turning.

Title: Time-Series Analysis on Edge-AI Hardware for Healthcare Monitoring
Authors: Jinhai Hu
Abstract: This project addresses the need for efficient, real-time analysis of biomedical signals such as electrocardiograms (ECG) and electroencephalograms (EEG) for continuous health monitoring. Traditional methods rely on long-duration data recording followed by offline analysis, which is power-intensive and delays responses to critical symptoms such as arrhythmia. To overcome these limitations, a time-domain ECG analysis model based on a novel dynamically-biased Long Short-Term Memory (DB-LSTM) neural network is proposed. This model supports simultaneous ECG forecasting and classification with high performance-achieving over 98% accuracy and a normalized mean square error below 1e-3 for forecasting, and over 97% accuracy with faster convergence and fewer training parameters for classification. To enable edge deployment, the model is hardware-optimized by quantizing weights to INT4 or INT3 formats, resulting in only a 2% and 6% drop in classification accuracy during training and inference, respectively, while maintaining full accuracy for forecasting. Extensive simulations using multiple ECG datasets confirm the model's robustness. Future work includes implementing the algorithm on FPGA and CMOS circuits for practical cardiac monitoring, as well as developing a digital hardware platform that supports flexible neural network configurations and on-chip online training for personalized healthcare applications.

Title: Scalable Discrete Event Simulation Tool for Large-Scale Cyber-Physical Energy Systems: Advancing System Efficiency and Scalability
Authors: Khandaker Akramul Haque, Shining Sun, Xiang Huo, Ana E. Goulart, Katherine R. Davis
Abstract: Modern power systems face growing risks from cyber-physical attacks, necessitating enhanced resilience due to their societal function as critical infrastructures. The challenge is that defense of large-scale systems-of-systems requires scalability in their threat and risk assessment environment for cyber physical analysis including cyber-informed transmission planning, decision-making, and intrusion response. Hence, we present a scalable discrete event simulation tool for analysis of energy systems, called DESTinE. The tool is tailored for largescale cyber-physical systems, with a focus on power systems. It supports faster-than-real-time traffic generation and models packet flow and congestion under both normal and adversarial conditions. Using three well-established power system synthetic cases with 500, 2000, and 10,000 buses, we overlay a constructed cyber network employing star and radial topologies. Experiments are conducted to identify critical nodes within a communication network in response to a disturbance. The findings are incorporated into a constrained optimization problem to assess the impact of the disturbance on a specific node and its cascading effects on the overall network. Based on the solution of the optimization problem, a new hybrid network topology is also derived, combining the strengths of star and radial structures to improve network resilience. Furthermore, DESTinE is integrated with a virtual server and a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) system using Raspberry Pi 5.

Title: Joint Knowledge and Power Management for Secure Semantic Communication Networks
Authors: Xuesong Liu, Yansong Liu, Haoyu Tang, Fangzhou Zhao, Le Xia, Yao Sun
Abstract: Recently, semantic communication (SemCom) has shown its great superiorities in resource savings and information exchanges. However, while its unique background knowledge guarantees accurate semantic reasoning and recovery, semantic information security-related concerns are introduced at the same time. Since the potential eavesdroppers may have the same background knowledge to accurately decrypt the private semantic information transmitted between legal SemCom users, this makes the knowledge management in SemCom networks rather challenging in joint consideration with the power control. To this end, this paper focuses on jointly addressing three core issues of power allocation, knowledge base caching (KBC), and device-to-device (D2D) user pairing (DUP) in secure SemCom networks. We first develop a novel performance metric, namely semantic secrecy throughput (SST), to quantify the information security level that can be achieved at each pair of D2D SemCom users. Next, an SST maximization problem is formulated subject to secure SemCom-related delay and reliability constraints. Afterward, we propose a security-aware resource management solution using the Lagrange primal-dual method and a two-stage method. Simulation results demonstrate our proposed solution nearly doubles the SST performance and realizes less than half of the queuing delay performance compared to different benchmarks.

Title: How competitive are pay-as-bid auction games?
Authors: Martina Vanelli, Giacomo Como, Fabio Fagnani
Abstract: Motivated by the current structure of ancillary services markets, we study the pay-as-bid auction game, a supply function model with discriminatory pricing and asymmetric firms. In this game, strategies are non-decreasing supply functions relating price to quantity and the exact choice of the strategy space turns out to be a crucial issue: when it includes all non-decreasing continuous functions, pure-strategy Nash equilibria often fail to exist. To overcome this, we restrict the strategy space to the set of Lipschitz-continuous functions and we prove that Nash equilibria always exist (under standard concavity assumptions) and consist of functions that are affine on their own support and have slope equal to the maximum allowed Lipschitz constant. We further show that the Nash equilibrium is unique up to the market-clearing price when the demand is affine and the asymmetric marginal production costs are homogeneous in zero. For quadratic production costs, we derive a closed-form expression and we compute the limit as the allowed Lipschitz constant grows to infinity. Our results show that in the limit the pay-as-bid auction game achieves perfect competition with efficient allocation and induces a lower market-clearing price compared to supply function models based on uniform price auctions.

Title: Wireless Silent Speech Interface Using Multi-Channel Textile EMG Sensors Integrated into Headphones
Authors: Chenyu Tang, Jos√©e Mallah, Dominika Kazieczko, Wentian Yi, Tharun Reddy Kandukuri, Edoardo Occhipinti, Bhaskar Mishra, Sunita Mehta, Luigi G. Occhipinti
Abstract: This paper presents a novel wireless silent speech interface (SSI) integrating multi-channel textile-based EMG electrodes into headphone earmuff for real-time, hands-free communication. Unlike conventional patch-based EMG systems, which require large-area electrodes on the face or neck, our approach ensures comfort, discretion, and wearability while maintaining robust silent speech decoding. The system utilizes four graphene/PEDOT:PSS-coated textile electrodes to capture speech-related neuromuscular activity, with signals processed via a compact ESP32-S3-based wireless readout module. To address the challenge of variable skin-electrode coupling, we propose a 1D SE-ResNet architecture incorporating squeeze-and-excitation (SE) blocks to dynamically adjust per-channel attention weights, enhancing robustness against motion-induced impedance variations. The proposed system achieves 96% accuracy on 10 commonly used voice-free control words, outperforming conventional single-channel and non-adaptive baselines. Experimental validation, including XAI-based attention analysis and t-SNE feature visualization, confirms the adaptive channel selection capability and effective feature extraction of the model. This work advances wearable EMG-based SSIs, demonstrating a scalable, low-power, and user-friendly platform for silent communication, assistive technologies, and human-computer interaction.

Title: ViMo: A Generative Visual GUI World Model for App Agent
Authors: Dezhao Luo, Bohan Tang, Kang Li, Georgios Papoudakis, Jifei Song, Shaogang Gong, Jianye Hao, Jun Wang, Kun Shao
Abstract: App agents, which autonomously operate mobile Apps through Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), have gained significant interest in real-world applications. Yet, they often struggle with long-horizon planning, failing to find the optimal actions for complex tasks with longer steps. To address this, world models are used to predict the next GUI observation based on user actions, enabling more effective agent planning. However, existing world models primarily focus on generating only textual descriptions, lacking essential visual details. To fill this gap, we propose ViMo, the first visual world model designed to generate future App observations as images. For the challenge of generating text in image patches, where even minor pixel errors can distort readability, we decompose GUI generation into graphic and text content generation. We propose a novel data representation, the Symbolic Text Representation~(STR) to overlay text content with symbolic placeholders while preserving graphics. With this design, ViMo employs a STR Predictor to predict future GUIs' graphics and a GUI-text Predictor for generating the corresponding text. Moreover, we deploy ViMo to enhance agent-focused tasks by predicting the outcome of different action options. Experiments show ViMo's ability to generate visually plausible and functionally effective GUIs that enable App agents to make more informed decisions.

Title: Prognosis Of Lithium-Ion Battery Health with Hybrid EKF-CNN+LSTM Model Using Differential Capacity
Authors: Md Azizul Hoque, Babul Salam, Mohd Khair Hassan, Abdulkabir Aliyu, Abedalmuhdi Almomany, Muhammed Sutcu
Abstract: Battery degradation is a major challenge in electric vehicles (EV) and energy storage systems (ESS). However, most degradation investigations focus mainly on estimating the state of charge (SOC), which fails to accurately interpret the cells' internal degradation mechanisms. Differential capacity analysis (DCA) focuses on the rate of change of cell voltage about the change in cell capacity, under various charge/discharge rates. This paper developed a battery cell degradation testing model that used two types of lithium-ions (Li-ion) battery cells, namely lithium nickel cobalt aluminium oxides (LiNiCoAlO2) and lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4), to evaluate internal degradation during loading conditions. The proposed battery degradation model contains distinct charge rates (DCR) of 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, and 1.5C, as well as discharge rates (DDR) of 0.5C, 0.9C, 1.3C, and 1.6C to analyze the internal health and performance of battery cells during slow, moderate, and fast loading conditions. Besides, this research proposed a model that incorporates the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to validate experimental data. The proposed model yields excellent modelling results based on mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE), with errors of less than 0.001% at DCR and DDR. The peak identification technique (PIM) has been utilized to investigate battery health based on the number of peaks, peak position, peak height, peak area, and peak width. At last, the PIM method has discovered that the cell aged gradually under normal loading rates but deteriorated rapidly under fast loading conditions. Overall, LiFePO4 batteries perform more robustly and consistently than (LiNiCoAlO2) cells under varying loading conditions.

Title: PC-DeepNet: A GNSS Positioning Error Minimization Framework Using Permutation-Invariant Deep Neural Network
Authors: M. Humayun Kabir, Md. Ali Hasan, Md. Shafiqul Islam, Kyeongjun Ko, Wonjae Shin
Abstract: Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) face significant challenges in urban and sub-urban areas due to non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation, multipath effects, and low received power levels, resulting in highly non-linear and non-Gaussian measurement error distributions. In light of this, conventional model-based positioning approaches, which rely on Gaussian error approximations, struggle to achieve precise localization under these conditions. To overcome these challenges, we put forth a novel learning-based framework, PC-DeepNet, that employs a permutation-invariant (PI) deep neural network (DNN) to estimate position corrections (PC). This approach is designed to ensure robustness against changes in the number and/or order of visible satellite measurements, a common issue in GNSS systems, while leveraging NLOS and multipath indicators as features to enhance positioning accuracy in challenging urban and sub-urban environments. To validate the performance of the proposed framework, we compare the positioning error with state-of-the-art model-based and learning-based positioning methods using two publicly available datasets. The results confirm that proposed PC-DeepNet achieves superior accuracy than existing model-based and learning-based methods while exhibiting lower computational complexity compared to previous learning-based approaches.

Title: LoftUp: Learning a Coordinate-Based Feature Upsampler for Vision Foundation Models
Authors: Haiwen Huang, Anpei Chen, Volodymyr Havrylov, Andreas Geiger, Dan Zhang
Abstract: Vision foundation models (VFMs) such as DINOv2 and CLIP have achieved impressive results on various downstream tasks, but their limited feature resolution hampers performance in applications requiring pixel-level understanding. Feature upsampling offers a promising direction to address this challenge. In this work, we identify two critical factors for enhancing feature upsampling: the upsampler architecture and the training objective. For the upsampler architecture, we introduce a coordinate-based cross-attention transformer that integrates the high-resolution images with coordinates and low-resolution VFM features to generate sharp, high-quality features. For the training objective, we propose constructing high-resolution pseudo-groundtruth features by leveraging class-agnostic masks and self-distillation. Our approach effectively captures fine-grained details and adapts flexibly to various input and feature resolutions. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing feature upsampling techniques across various downstream tasks. Our code is released at this https URL.

Title: Towards Optimal Orders for Entanglement Swapping in Path Graphs: A Greedy Approach
Authors: Van Sy Mai, Abderrahim Amlou, Amar Abane, Abdella Battou
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of finding an optimal order for entanglement swapping in a heterogeneous path of quantum repeaters so as to maximize the path throughput defined as the delivery rate of end-to-end entanglements. The primary difficulty in addressing this problem lies in the vast array of possible swapping orders for large paths and the complexity of the expected throughput, which depends on the attributes of each node and edge along the path, as well as the order of swapping. To cope with these issues, we first propose simple approximations in estimating the swapping outcome between two entanglement distributions that can run in constant time, thereby providing an efficient approach for evaluating and comparing different swapping orders, allowing us to solve the problem exactly for small paths. Second, as the number of possible orders grows exponentially with the number of repeaters in the path, we develop an efficient heuristic based on the greedy selection of nodes to sequentially perform swaps according to their swapping scores, defined as the expected number of entanglements resulting from their swaps. The scores are local but dynamic in the sense that they depend not just on the entanglement distributions available on the path but also on prior swapping decisions. Finally, we illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model and approach through extensive experimentation conducted using a general quantum network simulator.

Abstract: Advancements in audio neural networks have established state-of-the-art results on downstream audio tasks. However, the black-box structure of these models makes it difficult to interpret the information encoded in their internal audio representations. In this work, we explore the semantic interpretability of audio embeddings extracted from these neural networks by leveraging CLAP, a contrastive learning model that brings audio and text into a shared embedding space. We implement a post-hoc method to transform CLAP embeddings into concept-based, sparse representations with semantic interpretability. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that the concept-based representations outperform or match the performance of original audio embeddings on downstream tasks while providing interpretability. Additionally, we demonstrate that fine-tuning the concept-based representations can further improve their performance on downstream tasks. Lastly, we publish three audio-specific vocabularies for concept-based interpretability of audio embeddings.

Title: Charging While Driving Lanes: A Boon to Electric Vehicle Owners or a Disruption to Traffic Flow
Authors: Shayan Bafandkar, Alireza Talebpour
Abstract: Large-scale adoption of commercial and personal Electric Vehicles (EVs) is expected to significantly affect traffic flow dynamics, emissions, and energy consumption in the transportation sector. Range anxiety and challenges associated with charging EVs are among the key issues that reduce the adoption rate of EVs and, in turn, limit their system-level impacts. A promising solution to address these challenges is the introduction of charging while driving (CWD) lanes. Although technological advancements have made it possible to charge vehicles wirelessly while driving, introducing such lanes to the traffic stream can potentially disturb traffic flow and result in new congestion patterns. This study puts forward a framework to investigate the effects of CWD lanes on traffic flow, considering %autonomy, speed harmonization, and environmental factors for different market penetration rates (MPRs) of personal and commercial EVs. Different policies have been investigated to suggest the best design for CWD lanes. Results indicate that introducing CWD lanes can decrease overall traffic throughput and increase congestion due to additional lane-changing maneuvers by electric vehicles aiming to utilize the CWD lane. Although higher MPRs of EVs help stabilize traffic flow and reduce the number of shockwaves, speed disruption tends to increase in the CWD lane and propagate to adjacent lanes. Emission analyses show significant reductions (up to 63\%) in pollution levels with increasing MPRs of personal and commercial EVs. Our analysis shows that while CWD lanes can facilitate the adoption of EVs, they can deteriorate traffic efficiency, emphasizing the importance of careful design and policy considerations.

Title: Information Diffusion and Preferential Attachment in a Network of Large Language Models
Authors: Adit Jain, Vikram Krishnamurthy, Yiming Zhang
Abstract: This paper models information diffusion in a network of Large Language Models (LLMs) that is designed to answer queries from distributed datasets, where the LLMs can hallucinate the answer. We introduce a two-time-scale dynamical model for the centrally administered network, where opinions evolve faster while the network's degree distribution changes more slowly. Using a mean-field approximation, we establish conditions for a locally asymptotically stable equilibrium where all LLMs remain truthful. We provide approximation guarantees for the mean-field approximation and a singularly perturbed approximation of the two-time-scale system. To mitigate hallucination and improve the influence of truthful nodes, we propose a reputation-based preferential attachment mechanism that reconfigures the network based on LLMs' evaluations of their neighbors. Numerical experiments on an open-source LLM (LLaMA-3.1-8B) validate the efficacy of our preferential attachment mechanism and demonstrate the optimization of a cost function for the two-time-scale system.

Title: Joint Channel Estimation and Signal Detection for MIMO-OFDM: A Novel Data-Aided Approach with Reduced Computational Overhead
Authors: Xinjie Li, Jing Zhang, Xingyu Zhou, Chao-Kai Wen, Shi Jin
Abstract: The acquisition of channel state information (CSI) is essential in MIMO-OFDM communication systems. Data-aided enhanced receivers, by incorporating domain knowledge, effectively mitigate performance degradation caused by imperfect CSI, particularly in dynamic wireless environments. However, existing methodologies face notable challenges: they either refine channel estimates within MIMO subsystems separately, which proves ineffective due to deviations from assumptions regarding the time-varying nature of channels, or fully exploit the time-frequency characteristics but incur significantly high computational overhead due to dimensional concatenation. To address these issues, this study introduces a novel data-aided method aimed at reducing complexity, particularly suited for fast-fading scenarios in fifth-generation (5G) and beyond networks. We derive a general form of a data-aided linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE)-based algorithm, optimized for iterative joint channel estimation and signal detection. Additionally, we propose a computationally efficient alternative to this algorithm, which achieves comparable performance with significantly reduced complexity. Empirical evaluations reveal that our proposed algorithms outperform several state-of-the-art approaches across various MIMO-OFDM configurations, pilot sequence lengths, and in the presence of time variability. Comparative analysis with basis expansion model-based iterative receivers highlights the superiority of our algorithms in achieving an effective trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity.

Title: sEEG-based Encoding for Sentence Retrieval: A Contrastive Learning Approach to Brain-Language Alignment
Authors: Yijun Liu
Abstract: Interpreting neural activity through meaningful latent representations remains a complex and evolving challenge at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. We investigate the potential of multimodal foundation models to align invasive brain recordings with natural language. We present SSENSE, a contrastive learning framework that projects single-subject stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) signals into the sentence embedding space of a frozen CLIP model, enabling sentence-level retrieval directly from brain activity. SSENSE trains a neural encoder on spectral representations of sEEG using InfoNCE loss, without fine-tuning the text encoder. We evaluate our method on time-aligned sEEG and spoken transcripts from a naturalistic movie-watching dataset. Despite limited data, SSENSE achieves promising results, demonstrating that general-purpose language representations can serve as effective priors for neural decoding.

Title: On Dimension-Free Transformer: An Application of STP to AI
Authors: Daizhan Cheng
Abstract: The matrix expressions for every parts of a transformer are firstly described. Based on semi-tensor product (STP) of matrices the hypervectors are reconsidered and the linear transformation over hypervectors is constructed by using projection. Its properties and calculating formulas are obtained. Using projection-based transformation of hypervector (PBTH), the framework of dimension-free transformer (DFT) is proposed by verifying each linear transformation in a transformer and replacing it by a proper PBTH, which allows the inputs and outputs being of arbitrary dimensions. Using balanced information about all entries, DFT must be more efficient in dealing with signals.

Title: Haptic-based Complementary Filter for Rigid Body Rotations
Authors: Amit Kumar, Domenico Campolo, Ravi N. Banavar
Abstract: The non-commutative nature of 3D rotations poses well-known challenges in generalizing planar problems to three-dimensional ones, even more so in contact-rich tasks where haptic information (i.e., forces/torques) is involved. In this sense, not all learning-based algorithms that are currently available generalize to 3D orientation estimation. Non-linear filters defined on $\mathbf{\mathbb{SO}(3)}$ are widely used with inertial measurement sensors; however, none of them have been used with haptic measurements. This paper presents a unique complementary filtering framework that interprets the geometric shape of objects in the form of superquadrics, exploits the symmetry of $\mathbf{\mathbb{SO}(3)}$, and uses force and vision sensors as measurements to provide an estimate of orientation. The framework's robustness and almost global stability are substantiated by a set of experiments on a dual-arm robotic setup.

Title: Interdisciplinary Integration of Remote Sensing -- A Review with Four Examples
Authors: Zichen Jin
Abstract: As a high-level discipline, the development of remote sensing depends on the contribution of many other basic and applied disciplines and technologies. For example, due to the close relationship between remote sensing and photogrammetry, remote sensing would inevitably integrate disciplines such as optics and color science. Also, remote sensing integrates the knowledge of electronics in the conversion from optical signals to electrical signals via CCD (Charge-Coupled Device) or other image sensors. Moreover, when conducting object identification and classification with remote sensing data, mathematical morphology and other digital image processing technologies are used. These examples are only the tip of the iceberg of interdisciplinary integration of remote sensing. This work briefly reviews the interdisciplinary integration of remote sensing with four examples - ecology, mathematical morphology, machine learning, and electronics.

Title: HLSTester: Efficient Testing of Behavioral Discrepancies with LLMs for High-Level Synthesis
Authors: Kangwei Xu, Bing Li, Grace Li Zhang, Ulf Schlichtmann
Abstract: In high-level synthesis (HLS), C/C++ programs with synthesis directives are used to generate circuits for FPGA implementations. However, hardware-specific and platform-dependent characteristics in these implementations can introduce behavioral discrepancies between the original C/C++ programs and the circuits after high-level synthesis. Existing methods for testing behavioral discrepancies in HLS are still immature, and the testing workflow requires significant human efforts. To address this challenge, we propose HLSTester, a large language model (LLM) aided testing framework that efficiently detects behavioral discrepancies in HLS. To mitigate hallucinations in LLMs and enhance prompt quality, the testbenches for original C/C++ programs are leveraged to guide LLMs in generating HLS-compatible testbenches, effectively eliminating certain traditional C/C++ constructs that are incompatible with HLS tools. Key variables are pinpointed through a backward slicing technique in both C/C++ and HLS programs to monitor their runtime spectra, enabling an in-depth analysis of the discrepancy symptoms. To reduce test time, a testing input generation mechanism is introduced to integrate dynamic mutation with insights from an LLM-based progressive reasoning chain. In addition, repetitive hardware testing is skipped by a redundancy-aware filtering technique for the generated test inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-aided testing framework significantly accelerates the testing workflow while achieving higher testbench simulation pass rates compared with the traditional method and the direct use of LLMs on the same HLS programs.

Abstract: The emergence of sixth-generation and beyond communication systems is expected to fundamentally transform digital experiences through introducing unparalleled levels of intelligence, efficiency, and connectivity. A promising technology poised to enable this revolutionary vision is the wireless large AI model (WLAM), characterized by its exceptional capabilities in data processing, inference, and decision-making.

Title: Can We Ignore Labels In Out of Distribution Detection?
Authors: Hong Yang, Qi Yu, Travis Desel
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods have recently become more prominent, serving as a core element in safety-critical autonomous systems. One major purpose of OOD detection is to reject invalid inputs that could lead to unpredictable errors and compromise safety. Due to the cost of labeled data, recent works have investigated the feasibility of self-supervised learning (SSL) OOD detection, unlabeled OOD detection, and zero shot OOD detection. In this work, we identify a set of conditions for a theoretical guarantee of failure in unlabeled OOD detection algorithms from an information-theoretic perspective. These conditions are present in all OOD tasks dealing with real-world data: I) we provide theoretical proof of unlabeled OOD detection failure when there exists zero mutual information between the learning objective and the in-distribution labels, a.k.a. 'label blindness', II) we define a new OOD task - Adjacent OOD detection - that tests for label blindness and accounts for a previously ignored safety gap in all OOD detection benchmarks, and III) we perform experiments demonstrating that existing unlabeled OOD methods fail under conditions suggested by our label blindness theory and analyze the implications for future research in unlabeled OOD methods.

Title: DiffVox: A Differentiable Model for Capturing and Analysing Professional Effects Distributions
Authors: Chin-Yun Yu, Marco A. Mart√≠nez-Ram√≠rez, Junghyun Koo, Ben Hayes, Wei-Hsiang Liao, Gy√∂rgy Fazekas, Yuki Mitsufuji
Abstract: This study introduces a novel and interpretable model, DiffVox, for matching vocal effects in music production. DiffVox, short for ``Differentiable Vocal Fx", integrates parametric equalisation, dynamic range control, delay, and reverb with efficient differentiable implementations to enable gradient-based optimisation for parameter estimation. Vocal presets are retrieved from two datasets, comprising 70 tracks from MedleyDB and 365 tracks from a private collection. Analysis of parameter correlations highlights strong relationships between effects and parameters, such as the high-pass and low-shelf filters often behaving together to shape the low end, and the delay time correlates with the intensity of the delayed signals. Principal component analysis reveals connections to McAdams' timbre dimensions, where the most crucial component modulates the perceived spaciousness while the secondary components influence spectral brightness. Statistical testing confirms the non-Gaussian nature of the parameter distribution, highlighting the complexity of the vocal effects space. These initial findings on the parameter distributions set the foundation for future research in vocal effects modelling and automatic mixing.

Title: Advancing Video Anomaly Detection: A Bi-Directional Hybrid Framework for Enhanced Single- and Multi-Task Approaches
Authors: Guodong Shen, Yuqi Ouyang, Junru Lu, Yixuan Yang, Victor Sanchez
Abstract: Despite the prevailing transition from single-task to multi-task approaches in video anomaly detection, we observe that many adopt sub-optimal frameworks for individual proxy tasks. Motivated by this, we contend that optimizing single-task frameworks can advance both single- and multi-task approaches. Accordingly, we leverage middle-frame prediction as the primary proxy task, and introduce an effective hybrid framework designed to generate accurate predictions for normal frames and flawed predictions for abnormal frames. This hybrid framework is built upon a bi-directional structure that seamlessly integrates both vision transformers and ConvLSTMs. Specifically, we utilize this bi-directional structure to fully analyze the temporal dimension by predicting frames in both forward and backward directions, significantly boosting the detection stability. Given the transformer's capacity to model long-range contextual dependencies, we develop a convolutional temporal transformer that efficiently associates feature maps from all context frames to generate attention-based predictions for target frames. Furthermore, we devise a layer-interactive ConvLSTM bridge that facilitates the smooth flow of low-level features across layers and time-steps, thereby strengthening predictions with fine details. Anomalies are eventually identified by scrutinizing the discrepancies between target frames and their corresponding predictions. Several experiments conducted on public benchmarks affirm the efficacy of our hybrid framework, whether used as a standalone single-task approach or integrated as a branch in a multi-task approach. These experiments also underscore the advantages of merging vision transformers and ConvLSTMs for video anomaly detection.

Title: Safe Autonomous Environmental Contact for Soft Robots using Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Akua K. Dickson, Juan C. Pacheco Garcia, Meredith L. Anderson, Ran Jing, Sarah Alizadeh-Shabdiz, Audrey X. Wang, Charles DeLorey, Zach J. Patterson, Andrew P. Sabelhaus
Abstract: Robots built from soft materials will inherently apply lower environmental forces than their rigid counterparts, and therefore may be more suitable in sensitive settings with unintended contact. However, these robots' applied forces result from both their design and their control system in closed-loop, and therefore, ensuring bounds on these forces requires controller synthesis for safety as well. This article introduces the first feedback controller for a soft manipulator that formally meets a safety specification with respect to environmental contact. In our proof-of-concept setting, the robot's environment has known geometry and is deformable with a known elastic modulus. Our approach maps a bound on applied forces to a safe set of positions of the robot's tip via predicted deformations of the environment. Then, a quadratic program with Control Barrier Functions in its constraints is used to supervise a nominal feedback signal, verifiably maintaining the robot's tip within this safe set. Hardware experiments on a multi-segment soft pneumatic robot demonstrate that the proposed framework successfully constrains its environmental contact forces. This framework represents a fundamental shift in perspective on control and safety for soft robots, defining and implementing a formally verifiable logic specification on their pose and contact forces.

Title: How Effective Can Dropout Be in Multiple Instance Learning ?
Authors: Wenhui Zhu, Peijie Qiu, Xiwen Chen, Zhangsihao Yang, Aristeidis Sotiras, Abolfazl Razi, Yalin Wang
Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a popular weakly-supervised method for various applications, with a particular interest in histological whole slide image (WSI) classification. Due to the gigapixel resolution of WSI, applications of MIL in WSI typically necessitate a two-stage training scheme: first, extract features from the pre-trained backbone and then perform MIL aggregation. However, it is well-known that this suboptimal training scheme suffers from "noisy" feature embeddings from the backbone and inherent weak supervision, hindering MIL from learning rich and generalizable features. However, the most commonly used technique (i.e., dropout) for mitigating this issue has yet to be explored in MIL. In this paper, we empirically explore how effective the dropout can be in MIL. Interestingly, we observe that dropping the top-k most important instances within a bag leads to better performance and generalization even under noise attack. Based on this key observation, we propose a novel MIL-specific dropout method, termed MIL-Dropout, which systematically determines which instances to drop. Experiments on five MIL benchmark datasets and two WSI datasets demonstrate that MIL-Dropout boosts the performance of current MIL methods with a negligible computational cost. The code is available at this https URL.

Title: Edge-boosted graph learning for functional brain connectivity analysis
Authors: David Yang, Mostafa Abdelmegeed, John Modl, Minjeong Kim
Abstract: Predicting disease states from functional brain connectivity is critical for the early diagnosis of severe neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease. Existing studies commonly employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to infer clinical diagnoses from node-based brain connectivity matrices generated through node-to-node similarities of regionally averaged fMRI signals. However, recent neuroscience studies found that such node-based connectivity does not accurately capture ``functional connections" within the brain. This paper proposes a novel approach to brain network analysis that emphasizes edge functional connectivity (eFC), shifting the focus to inter-edge relationships. Additionally, we introduce a co-embedding technique to integrate edge functional connections effectively. Experimental results on the ADNI and PPMI datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GNN methods in classifying functional brain networks.

Abstract: This paper develops a novel unmanned surface vehicle (USV)-autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) collaborative system designed to enhance underwater task performance in extreme sea conditions. The system integrates a dual strategy: (1) high-precision multi-AUV localization enabled by Fisher information matrix-optimized USV path planning, and (2) reinforcement learning-based cooperative planning and control method for multi-AUV task execution. Extensive experimental evaluations in the underwater data collection task demonstrate the system's operational feasibility, with quantitative results showing significant performance improvements over baseline methods. The proposed system exhibits robust coordination capabilities between USV and AUVs while maintaining stability in extreme sea conditions.

Title: Generative Semantic Communications: Principles and Practices
Authors: Xiaojun Yuan, Haoming Ma, Yinuo Huang, Zhoufan Hua, Yong Zuo, Zhi Ding
Abstract: Semantic communication leverages artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to extract semantic information from data for efficient transmission, theraby significantly reducing communication cost. With the evolution towards artificial general intelligence (AGI), the increasing demands for AGI services pose new challenges to semantic communication. In response, we propose a new paradigm for AGI-driven communications, called generative semantic communication (GSC), which utilizes advanced AI technologies such as foundation models and generative models. We first describe the basic concept of GSC and its difference from existing semantic communications, and then introduce a general framework of GSC, followed by two case studies to verify the advantages of GSC in AGI-driven applications. Finally, open challenges and new research directions are discussed to stimulate this line of research and pave the way for practical applications.

Title: PIV-FlowDiffuser:Transfer-learning-based denoising diffusion models for PIV
Authors: Qianyu Zhu, Junjie Wang, Jeremiah Hu, Jia Ai, Yong Lee
Abstract: Deep learning algorithms have significantly reduced the computational time and improved the spatial resolution of particle image velocimetry~(PIV). However, the models trained on synthetic datasets might have a degraded performance on practical particle images due to domain gaps. As a result, special residual patterns are often observed for the vector fields of deep learning-based estimators. To reduce the special noise step-by-step, we employ a denoising diffusion model~(FlowDiffuser) for PIV analysis. And the data-hungry iterative denoising diffusion model is trained via a transfer learning strategy, resulting in our PIV-FlowDiffuser method. Specifically, (1) pre-training a FlowDiffuser model with multiple optical flow datasets of the computer vision community, such as Sintel, KITTI, etc; (2) fine-tuning the pre-trained model on synthetic PIV datasets. Note that the PIV images are upsampled by a factor of two to resolve the small-scale turbulent flow structures. The visualized results indicate that our PIV-FlowDiffuser effectively suppresses the noise patterns. Therefore, the denoising diffusion model reduces the average end-point error~($AEE$) by 59.4% over RAFT256-PIV baseline on the classic Cai's dataset. Besides, PIV-FlowDiffuser exhibits enhanced generalization performance on unseen particle images due to transfer learning. Overall, this study highlights the transfer-learning-based denoising diffusion models for PIV. And a detailed implementation is recommended for interested readers in the repository this https URL.

Title: Feedback Stackelberg-Nash equilibria in difference games with quasi-hierarchical interactions and inequality constraints
Authors: Partha Sarathi Mohapatra, Puduru Viswanadha Reddy, Georges Zaccour
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of two-player deterministic finite-horizon difference games with coupled inequality constraints, where each player has two types of decision variables: one involving sequential interactions and the other simultaneous interactions. We refer to these as quasi-hierarchical dynamic games and define a solution concept called the feedback Stackelberg-Nash (FSN) equilibrium. Under a separability assumption on cost functions, we formulate FSN solutions recursively using a dynamic programming-like approach. We further show that the FSN solution for these constrained games can be derived from the parametric feedback Stackelberg solution of an associated unconstrained game with only sequential interactions, given parameter choices that satisfy implicit complementarity conditions. For the linear-quadratic case, we show that the FSN solutions are obtained by reformulating these complementarity conditions as a single large-scale linear complementarity problem. Finally, we illustrate our results with a dynamic duopoly game with production constraints.

Title: Testing LLMs' Capabilities in Annotating Translations Based on an Error Typology Designed for LSP Translation: First Experiments with ChatGPT
Authors: Joachim Minder, Guillaume Wisniewski, Natalie K√ºbler
Abstract: This study investigates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, in annotating MT outputs based on an error typology. In contrast to previous work focusing mainly on general language, we explore ChatGPT's ability to identify and categorise errors in specialised translations. By testing two different prompts and based on a customised error typology, we compare ChatGPT annotations with human expert evaluations of translations produced by DeepL and ChatGPT itself. The results show that, for translations generated by DeepL, recall and precision are quite high. However, the degree of accuracy in error categorisation depends on the prompt's specific features and its level of detail, ChatGPT performing very well with a detailed prompt. When evaluating its own translations, ChatGPT achieves significantly poorer results, revealing limitations with self-assessment. These results highlight both the potential and the limitations of LLMs for translation evaluation, particularly in specialised domains. Our experiments pave the way for future research on open-source LLMs, which could produce annotations of comparable or even higher quality. In the future, we also aim to test the practical effectiveness of this automated evaluation in the context of translation training, particularly by optimising the process of human evaluation by teachers and by exploring the impact of annotations by LLMs on students' post-editing and translation learning.

Title: Optimal Behavior Planning for Implicit Communication using a Probabilistic Vehicle-Pedestrian Interaction Model
Authors: Markus Amann, Malte Probst, Raphael Wenzel, Thomas H. Weisswange, Miguel √Ångel Sotelo
Abstract: In interactions between automated vehicles (AVs) and crossing pedestrians, modeling implicit vehicle communication is crucial. In this work, we present a combined prediction and planning approach that allows to consider the influence of the planned vehicle behavior on a pedestrian and predict a pedestrian's reaction. We plan the behavior by solving two consecutive optimal control problems (OCPs) analytically, using variational calculus. We perform a validation step that assesses whether the planned vehicle behavior is adequate to trigger a certain pedestrian reaction, which accounts for the closed-loop characteristics of prediction and planning influencing each other. In this step, we model the influence of the planned vehicle behavior on the pedestrian using a probabilistic behavior acceptance model that returns an estimate for the crossing probability. The probabilistic modeling of the pedestrian reaction facilitates considering the pedestrian's costs, thereby improving cooperative behavior planning. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach in simulated vehicle-pedestrian interactions with varying initial settings and highlight the decision making capabilities of the planning approach.

Title: Fully Adaptive Stepsizes: Which System Benefit More -- Centralized or Decentralized?
Authors: Diyako Ghaderyan, Stefan Werner
Abstract: In decentralized optimization, the choice of stepsize plays a critical role in algorithm performance. A common approach is to use a shared stepsize across all agents to ensure convergence. However, selecting an optimal stepsize often requires careful tuning, which can be time-consuming and may lead to slow convergence, especially when there is significant variation in the smoothness (L-smoothness) of local objective functions across agents. Individually tuning stepsizes per agent is also impractical, particularly in large-scale networks. To address these limitations, we propose AdGT, an adaptive gradient tracking method that enables each agent to adjust its stepsize based on the smoothness of its local objective. We prove that AdGT generates a sequence of iterates that converges to the optimal consensus solution. Through numerical experiments, we compare AdGT with fixed-stepsize gradient tracking methods and demonstrate its superior performance. Additionally, we compare AdGT with adaptive gradient descent (AdGD) in a centralized setting and observe that fully adaptive stepsizes offer greater benefits in decentralized networks than in centralized ones.

Title: A Genetic Fuzzy-Enabled Framework on Robotic Manipulation for In-Space Servicing
Authors: Nathan Steffen, Wilhelm Louw, Nicholas Ernest, Timothy Arnett, Kelly Cohen
Abstract: Automation of robotic systems for servicing in cislunar space is becoming extremely important as the number of satellites in orbit increases. Safety is critical in performing satellite maintenance, so the control techniques utilized must be trusted in addition to being highly efficient. In this work, Genetic Fuzzy Trees are combined with the widely used LQR control scheme via Thales' TrUE AI Toolkit to create a trusted and efficient controller for a two-degree-of-freedom planar robotic manipulator that would theoretically be used to perform satellite maintenance. It was found that Genetic Fuzzy-LQR is 18.5% more performant than optimal LQR on average, and that it is incredibly robust to uncertainty.

Title: Training Neural Networks on RAW and HDR Images for Restoration Tasks
Authors: Andrew Yanzhe Ke, Lei Luo, Xiaoyu Xiang, Yuchen Fan, Rakesh Ranjan, Alexandre Chapiro, Rafa≈Ç K. Mantiuk
Abstract: The vast majority of standard image and video content available online is represented in display-encoded color spaces, in which pixel values are conveniently scaled to a limited range (0-1) and the color distribution is approximately perceptually uniform. In contrast, both camera RAW and high dynamic range (HDR) images are often represented in linear color spaces, in which color values are linearly related to colorimetric quantities of light. While training on commonly available display-encoded images is a well-established practice, there is no consensus on how neural networks should be trained for tasks on RAW and HDR images in linear color spaces. In this work, we test several approaches on three popular image restoration applications: denoising, deblurring, and single-image super-resolution. We examine whether HDR/RAW images need to be display-encoded using popular transfer functions (PQ, PU21, and mu-law), or whether it is better to train in linear color spaces, but use loss functions that correct for perceptual non-uniformity. Our results indicate that neural networks train significantly better on HDR and RAW images represented in display-encoded color spaces, which offer better perceptual uniformity than linear spaces. This small change to the training strategy can bring a very substantial gain in performance, between 2 and 9 dB.

Title: Fast Data-driven Greedy Sensor Selection for Ridge Regression
Authors: Yasuo Sasaki, Keigo Yamada, Takayuki Nagata, Yuji Saito, Taku Nonomura
Abstract: We propose a data-driven sensor-selection algorithm for accurate estimation of the target variables from the selected measurements. The target variables are assumed to be estimated by a ridge-regression estimator which is trained based on the data. The proposed algorithm greedily selects sensors for minimizing the cost function of the estimator. Sensor selection which prevents overfitting of the resulting estimator can be realized by setting a positive regularization parameter. The greedy solution is computed in quite a short time by using some recurrent relations that we derive. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified for artificial datasets which are generated from linear systems and a real-wold dataset which are aimed for selection of pressure-sensor locations for estimating yaw angle of a ground vehicle. The demonstration for the datasets reveal that the proposed algorithm computes a sensor set resulting in more accurate estimation than existing data-drive selection algorithms in some conditions. Furthermore, it is confirmed that setting a positive regularization parameter in the proposed algorithm leads to accurate estimation when overfitting is problematic.

Title: Analyzing Downlink Coverage in Clustered Low Earth Orbit Satellite Constellations: A Stochastic Geometry Approach
Authors: Miyeon Lee, Sucheol Kim, Minje Kim, Dong-Hyun Jung, Junil Choi
Abstract: Satellite networks are emerging as vital solutions for global connectivity beyond 5G. As companies such as SpaceX, OneWeb, and Amazon are poised to launch a large number of satellites in low Earth orbit, the heightened inter-satellite interference caused by mega-constellations has become a significant concern. To address this challenge, recent works have introduced the concept of satellite cluster networks where multiple satellites in a cluster collaborate to enhance the network performance. In order to investigate the performance of these networks, we propose mathematical analyses by modeling the locations of satellites and users using Poisson point processes, building on the success of stochastic geometry-based analyses for satellite networks. In particular, we suggest the lower and upper bounds of the coverage probability as functions of the system parameters, including satellite density, satellite altitude, satellite cluster area, path loss exponent, and Nakagami parameter $m$. We validate the analytical expressions by comparing them with simulation results. Our analyses can be used to design reliable satellite cluster networks by effectively estimating the impact of system parameters on the coverage performance.

Title: Accelerated Real-time Cine and Flow under In-magnet Staged Exercise
Authors: Preethi Chandrasekaran, Chong Chen, Yingmin Liu, Syed Murtaza Arshad, Christopher Crabtree, Matthew Tong, Yuchi Han, Rizwan Ahmad
Abstract: Background: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is a well established imaging tool for diagnosing and managing cardiac conditions. The integration of exercise stress with CMR (ExCMR) can enhance its diagnostic capacity. Despite recent advances in CMR technology, quantitative ExCMR during exercise remains technically challenging due to motion artifacts and limited spatial and temporal resolution. Methods: This study investigated the feasibility of biventricular functional and hemodynamic assessment using real-time (RT) ExCMR during a staged exercise protocol in 24 healthy volunteers. We employed high acceleration rates and applied a coil reweighting technique to minimize motion blurring and artifacts. We further applied a beat-selection technique that identified beats from the endexpiratory phase to minimize the impact of respiration-induced through-plane motion on cardiac function quantification. Additionally, results from six patients were presented to demonstrate clinical feasibility. Results: Our findings indicated a consistent decrease in end-systolic volume and stable end-diastolic volume across exercise intensities, leading to increased stroke volume and ejection fraction. The selection of end-expiratory beats modestly enhanced the repeatability of cardiac function parameters, as shown by scan-rescan tests in nine volunteers. High scores from a blinded image quality assessment indicated that coil reweighting effectively minimized motion artifacts. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility of RT ExCMR with inmagnet exercise in healthy subjects and patients. Our results indicate that high acceleration rates, coil reweighting, and selection of respiratory phase-specific heartbeats enhance image quality and repeatability of quantitative RT ExCMR.

Abstract: Previous foundation models for fundus images were pre-trained with limited disease categories and knowledge base. Here we introduce a knowledge-rich vision-language model (RetiZero) that leverages knowledge from more than 400 fundus diseases. For RetiZero's pretraining, we compiled 341,896 fundus images paired with texts, sourced from public datasets, ophthalmic literature, and online resources, encompassing a diverse range of diseases across multiple ethnicities and countries. RetiZero exhibits remarkable performance in several downstream tasks, including zero-shot disease recognition, image-to-image retrieval, AI-assisted clinical diagnosis,few-shot fine-tuning, and internal- and cross-domain disease identification. In zero-shot scenarios, RetiZero achieves Top-5 accuracies of 0.843 for 15 diseases and 0.756 for 52 diseases. For image retrieval, it achieves Top-5 scores of 0.950 and 0.886 for the same sets, respectively. AI-assisted clinical diagnosis results show that RetiZero's Top-3 zero-shot performance surpasses the average of 19 ophthalmologists from Singapore, China, and the United States. RetiZero substantially enhances clinicians' accuracy in diagnosing fundus diseases, in particularly rare ones. These findings underscore the value of integrating the RetiZero into clinical settings, where various fundus diseases are encountered.

Title: Stop-and-go wave super-resolution reconstruction via iterative refinement
Authors: Junyi Ji, Alex Richardson, Derek Gloudemans, Gergely Zach√°r, Matthew Nice, William Barbour, Jonathan Sprinkle, Benedetto Piccoli, Daniel B. Work
Abstract: Stop-and-go waves are a fundamental phenomenon in freeway traffic flow, contributing to inefficiencies, crashes, and emissions. Recent advancements in high-fidelity sensor technologies have improved the ability to capture detailed traffic dynamics, yet such systems remain scarce and costly. In contrast, conventional traffic sensors are widely deployed but suffer from relatively coarse-grain data resolution, potentially impeding accurate analysis of stop-and-go waves. This article explores whether generative AI models can enhance the resolution of conventional traffic sensor to approximate the quality of high-fidelity observations. We present a novel approach using a conditional diffusion denoising model, designed to reconstruct fine-grained traffic speed field from radar-based conventional sensors via iterative refinement. We introduce a new dataset, I24-WaveX, comprising 132 hours of data from both low and high-fidelity sensor systems, totaling over 2 million vehicle miles traveled. Our approach leverages this dataset to formulate the traffic measurement enhancement problem as a spatio-temporal super-resolution task. We demonstrate that our model can effectively reproduce the patterns of stop-and-go waves, achieving high accuracy in capturing these critical traffic dynamics. Our results show promising advancements in traffic data enhancement, offering a cost-effective way to leverage existing low spatio-temporal resolution sensor networks for improved traffic analysis and management. We also open-sourced our trained model and code to facilitate further research and applications.

Title: $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal Model Reduction of Linear Quadratic Output Systems in Finite Frequency Range
Authors: Umair Zulfiqar, Zhi-Hua Xiao, Qiu-Yan Song, Mohammad Monir Uddin, Victor Sreeram
Abstract: In frequency-limited model order reduction, the objective is to maintain the frequency response of the original system within a specified frequency range in the reduced-order model. In this paper, a mathematical expression for the frequency-limited $\mathcal{H}_2$ norm is derived, which quantifies the error within the desired frequency interval. Subsequently, the necessary conditions for a local optimum of the frequency-limited $\mathcal{H}_2$ norm of the error are derived. The inherent difficulty in satisfying these conditions within a Petrov-Galerkin projection framework is also discussed. Using the optimality conditions and the Petrov-Galerkin projection, a stationary point iteration algorithm is proposed, which approximately satisfies these optimality conditions upon convergence. The main computational effort in the proposed algorithm involves solving sparse-dense Sylvester equations. These equations are frequently encountered in $\mathcal{H}_2$ model order reduction algorithms and can be solved efficiently. Moreover, the algorithm bypasses the requirement of matrix logarithm computation, which is typically necessary for most frequency-limited reduction methods and can be computationally demanding for high-order systems. An illustrative example is provided to numerically validate the developed theory. The proposed algorithm's effectiveness in accurately approximating the original high-order model within the specified frequency range is demonstrated through the reduction of an advection-diffusion equation-based model, commonly used in model reduction literature for testing algorithms. Additionally, the algorithm's computational efficiency is highlighted by successfully reducing a flexible space structure model of order one million.

Title: Conditional Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model for VHR SAR to Optical Image Translation
Authors: Seon-Hoon Kim, Dae-Won Chung
Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging technology provides the unique advantage of being able to collect data regardless of weather conditions and time. However, SAR images exhibit complex backscatter patterns and speckle noise, which necessitate expertise for interpretation. Research on translating SAR images into optical-like representations has been conducted to aid the interpretation of SAR data. Nevertheless, existing studies have predominantly utilized low-resolution satellite imagery datasets and have largely been based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which are known for their training instability and low fidelity. To overcome these limitations of low-resolution data usage and GAN-based approaches, this letter introduces a conditional image-to-image translation approach based on Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM). We conducted comprehensive experiments on the MSAW dataset, a paired SAR and optical images collection of 0.5m Very-High-Resolution (VHR). The experimental results indicate that our method surpasses both the Conditional Diffusion Models (CDMs) and the GAN-based models in diverse perceptual quality metrics.

Title: MANGO: Learning Disentangled Image Transformation Manifolds with Grouped Operators
Authors: Brighton Ancelin, Yenho Chen, Peimeng Guan, Chiraag Kaushik, Belen Martin-Urcelay, Alex Saad-Falcon, Nakul Singh
Abstract: Learning semantically meaningful image transformations (i.e. rotation, thickness, blur) directly from examples can be a challenging task. Recently, the Manifold Autoencoder (MAE) proposed using a set of Lie group operators to learn image transformations directly from examples. However, this approach has limitations, as the learned operators are not guaranteed to be disentangled and the training routine is prohibitively expensive when scaling up the model. To address these limitations, we propose MANGO (transformation Manifolds with Grouped Operators) for learning disentangled operators that describe image transformations in distinct latent subspaces. Moreover, our approach allows practitioners the ability to define which transformations they aim to model, thus improving the semantic meaning of the learned operators. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that MANGO enables composition of image transformations and introduces a one-phase training routine that leads to a 100x speedup over prior works.

Authors: Teimour Hosseinalizadeh, Nima Monshizadeh
Abstract: In the recent years, we have observed three significant trends in control systems: a renewed interest in data-driven control design, the abundance of cloud computational services and the importance of preserving privacy for the system under control. Motivated by these factors, this work investigates privacy-preserving outsourcing for the design of a stabilizing controller for unknown linear time-invariant this http URL main objective of this research is to preserve the privacy for the system dynamics by designing an outsourcing mechanism. To achieve this goal, we propose a scheme that combines transformation-based techniques and robust data-driven control design methods. The scheme preserves the privacy of both the open-loop and closed-loop system matrices while stabilizing the system under this http URL scheme is applicable to both data with and without disturbance and is lightweight in terms of computational overhead. Numerical investigations for a case study demonstrate the impacts of our mechanism and its role in hindering malicious adversaries from achieving their goals.

Title: A Survey on Speech Large Language Models
Authors: Jing Peng, Yucheng Wang, Yu Xi, Xu Li, Xizhuo Zhang, Kai Yu
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong contextual understanding and remarkable multitask performance. As a result, researchers have been actively exploring the integration of LLMs into the domain of speech understanding, with a primary focus on a broad range of speech-to-text tasks. These include automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech-to-text translation (ST), speech emotion recognition (SER), and others. We refer to such models as Speech LLMs, which are typically built on a unified architecture that follows the pipeline of Audio Feature Extraction -> Multimodal Information Fusion -> LLM Inference. This approach enables richer audio feature extraction while facilitating end-to-end fusion of audio and text modalities, thereby achieving deeper understanding and reasoning from audio data. This paper elucidates the development of Speech LLMs, offering an in-depth analysis of system architectures. Through extensive research and a series of targeted experiments, the paper assesses the advancements in Speech LLMs and their potential for cross-task integration within the speech understanding field. Furthermore, it highlights key challenges identified through experimentation, such as the dormancy of LLMs under certain conditions. The paper further explores training strategies for Speech LLMs, proposes potential solutions based on these findings, and offers valuable insights and references for future research.

Title: Robust multi-coil MRI reconstruction via self-supervised denoising
Authors: Asad Aali, Marius Arvinte, Sidharth Kumar, Yamin I. Arefeen, Jonathan I. Tamir
Abstract: To examine the effect of incorporating self-supervised denoising as a pre-processing step for training deep learning (DL) based reconstruction methods on data corrupted by Gaussian noise. K-space data employed for training are typically multi-coil and inherently noisy. Although DL-based reconstruction methods trained on fully sampled data can enable high reconstruction quality, obtaining large, noise-free datasets is impractical. We leverage Generalized Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (GSURE) for denoising. We evaluate two DL-based reconstruction methods: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) and Model-Based Deep Learning (MoDL). We evaluate the impact of denoising on the performance of these DL-based methods in solving accelerated multi-coil magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction. The experiments were carried out on T2-weighted brain and fat-suppressed proton-density knee scans. We observed that self-supervised denoising enhances the quality and efficiency of MRI reconstructions across various scenarios. Specifically, employing denoised images rather than noisy counterparts when training DL networks results in lower normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE), higher structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) across different SNR levels, including 32dB, 22dB, and 12dB for T2-weighted brain data, and 24dB, 14dB, and 4dB for fat-suppressed knee data. Overall, we showed that denoising is an essential pre-processing technique capable of improving the efficacy of DL-based MRI reconstruction methods under diverse conditions. By refining the quality of input data, denoising enables training more effective DL networks, potentially bypassing the need for noise-free reference MRI scans.

Title: Hyperspectral image fusion, Unsupervised hyperspectral super-resolution, Modality decoupling, Self-supervised learning
Authors: Songcheng Du, Yang Zou, Zixu Wang, Xingyuan Li, Ying Li, Changjing Shang, Qiang Shen
Abstract: Hyperspectral and Multispectral Image Fusion (HMIF) aims to fuse low-resolution hyperspectral images (LR-HSIs) and high-resolution multispectral images (HR-MSIs) to reconstruct high spatial and high spectral resolution images. Current methods typically apply direct fusion from the two modalities without effective supervision, leading to an incomplete perception of deep modality-complementary information and a limited understanding of inter-modality correlations. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective solution for unsupervised HMIF, revealing that modality decoupling is key to improving fusion performance. Specifically, we propose an end-to-end self-supervised \textbf{Mo}dality-Decoupled \textbf{S}patial-\textbf{S}pectral Fusion (\textbf{MossFuse}) framework that decouples shared and complementary information across modalities and aggregates a concise representation of both LR-HSIs and HR-MSIs to reduce modality redundancy. Also, we introduce the subspace clustering loss as a clear guide to decouple modality-shared features from modality-complementary ones. Systematic experiments over multiple datasets demonstrate that our simple and effective approach consistently outperforms the existing HMIF methods while requiring considerably fewer parameters with reduced inference time. The anonymous source code is in \href{this https URL}{MossFuse}.

Title: Spatial-Division ISAC: A Practical Waveform Design Strategy via Null-Space Superimposition
Authors: Byunghyun Lee, Hwanjin Kim, David J. Love, James V. Krogmeier
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is a key enabler of new applications, such as precision agriculture, extended reality (XR), and digital twins, for 6G wireless systems. However, the implementation of ISAC technology is very challenging due to practical constraints such as high complexity. In this paper, we introduce a novel ISAC waveform design strategy, called the spatial-division ISAC (SD-ISAC) waveform, which simplifies the ISAC waveform design problem by decoupling it into separate communication and radar waveform design tasks. Specifically, the proposed strategy leverages the null-space of the communication channel to superimpose sensing signals onto communication signals without interference. This approach offers multiple benefits, including reduced complexity and the reuse of existing communication and radar waveforms. We then address the problem of optimizing the spatial and temporal properties of the proposed waveform. We develop a low-complexity beampattern matching algorithm, leveraging a majorization-minimization (MM) technique. Furthermore, we develop a range sidelobe suppression algorithm based on manifold optimization. We provide comprehensive discussions on the practical advantages and potential challenges of the proposed method, including null-space feedback. We evaluate the performance of the proposed waveform design algorithm through extensive simulations. Simulation results show that the proposed method can provide similar or even superior performance to existing ISAC algorithms while reducing computation time significantly.

Title: Comparative clinical evaluation of "memory-efficient" synthetic 3d generative adversarial networks (gan) head-to-head to state of art: results on computed tomography of the chest
Authors: Mahshid Shiri, Chandra Bortolotto, Alessandro Bruno, Alessio Consonni, Daniela Maria Grasso, Leonardo Brizzi, Daniele Loiacono, Lorenzo Preda
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are increasingly used to generate synthetic medical images, addressing the critical shortage of annotated data for training Artificial Intelligence systems. This study introduces CRF-GAN, a novel memory-efficient GAN architecture that enhances structural consistency in 3D medical image synthesis. Integrating Conditional Random Fields within a two-step generation process allows CRF-GAN improving spatial coherence while maintaining high-resolution image quality. The model's performance is evaluated against the state-of-the-art hierarchical (HA)-GAN model. Materials and Methods: We evaluate the performance of CRF-GAN against the HA-GAN model. The comparison between the two models was made through a quantitative evaluation, using FID and MMD metrics, and a qualitative evaluation, through a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) test completed by a pool of 12 resident radiologists, to assess the realism of the generated images. Results: CRF-GAN outperformed HA-GAN with lower FID and MMD scores, indicating better image fidelity. The 2AFC test showed a significant preference for images generated by CRF-Gan over those generated by HA-GAN. Additionally, CRF-GAN demonstrated 9.34% lower memory usage and achieved up to 14.6% faster training speeds, offering substantial computational savings. Discussion: CRF-GAN model successfully generates high-resolution 3D medical images with non-inferior quality to conventional models, while being more memory-efficient and faster. The key objective was not only to lower the computational cost but also to reallocate the freed-up resources towards the creation of higher-resolution 3D imaging, which is still a critical factor limiting their direct clinical applicability. Moreover, unlike many previous studies, we combined qualitative and quantitative assessments to obtain a more holistic feedback on the model's performance.

Title: Replacing K-infinity Function with Leaky ReLU in Barrier Function Design: A Union of Invariant Sets Approach for ReLU-Based Dynamical Systems
Authors: Pouya Samanipour, Hasan Poonawala
Abstract: In this paper, a systematic framework is presented for determining piecewise affine PWA barrier functions and their corresponding invariant sets for dynamical systems identified via Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) neural networks or their equivalent PWA representations. A common approach to determining the invariant set is to use Nagumo's condition, or to utilize the barrier function with a class K-infinity function. It may be challenging to find a suitable class K-infinity function in some cases. We propose leaky ReLU as an efficient substitute for the complex nonlinear K-infinity function in our formulation. Moreover, we propose the Union of Invariant Sets (UIS) method, which combines information from multiple invariant sets in order to compute the largest possible PWA invariant set. The proposed framework is validated through multiple examples, showcasing its potential to enhance the analysis of invariant sets in ReLU-based dynamical systems. Our code is available at: this https URL.

Title: Unsupervised Learning for AoD Estimation in MISO Downlink LoS Transmissions
Authors: Jiaying Li, Yuanwei Liu, Hong Xing
Abstract: With the emergence of simultaneous localization and communication (SLAC), it becomes more and more attractive to perform angle of departure (AoD) estimation at the receiving Internet of Thing (IoT) user end for improved positioning accuracy, flexibility and enhanced user privacy. To address challenges like a large number of real-time measurements required for latency-critical applications and enormous data collection for training deep learning models in conventional AoD estimation methods, we propose in this letter an unsupervised learning framework, which unifies training for both deterministic maximum likelihood (DML) and stochastic maximum likelihood (SML) based AoD estimation in multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink (DL) wireless transmissions. Specifically, under the line-of-sight (LoS) assumption, we incorporate both the received signals and pilot-sequence information, as per its availability at the DL user, into the input of the deep learning model, and adopt a common neural network architecture compatible with input data in both DML and SML cases. Extensive numerical results validate that the proposed unsupervised learning based AoD estimation not only improves estimation accuracy, but also significantly reduces required number of observations, thereby reducing both estimation overhead and latency compared to various benchmarks.

Title: xApp Conflict Mitigation with Scheduler
Authors: Idris Cinemre, Toktam Mahmoodi, Amirmohammad Farzaneh
Abstract: Open RAN (O-RAN) fosters multi-vendor interoperability and data-driven control but simultaneously introduces the challenge of coordinating pre-trained xApps that may produce conflicting actions. Although O-RAN specifications mandate offline training and validation to prevent the deployment of untrained or inadequately tested models, operational conflicts can still arise under dynamic and context-dependent this http URL work proposes a scheduler-based conflict mitigation framework to address these challenges without requiring training xApps together or further xApp re-training. By examining an indirect conflict involving power and resource block allocation xApps and employing an Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) approach to train both xApps and the scheduler, we illustrate that a straightforward A2C-based scheduler improves performance relative to independently deployed xApps and conflicting cases. Notably, among all tested deployment scenarios (including individual xApp deployment, multiple conflicting xApps, and limited scheduler configurations), augmenting the system with baseline xApps and enabling the scheduler to select from a broader pool achieves the highest total transmission rate, thereby underscoring the importance of adaptive scheduling mechanisms. These findings highlight the context-dependent nature of conflicts in automated network management, as two xApps may conflict under certain conditions but coexist under others. Consequently, the ability to dynamically update and adapt the scheduler to accommodate diverse operational intents is vital for future network deployments. By offering dynamic scheduling without re-training xApps, this framework advances practical conflict resolution solutions while supporting real-world scalability.

Title: Fusing Bluetooth with Pedestrian Dead Reckoning: A Floor Plan-Assisted Positioning Approach
Authors: Wenxuan Pan, Yang Yang, Mingzhe Chen, Dong Wei, Caili Guo, Shiwen Mao
Abstract: Floor plans can provide valuable prior information that helps enhance the accuracy of indoor positioning systems. However, existing research typically faces challenges in efficiently leveraging floor plan information and applying it to complex indoor layouts. To fully exploit information from floor plans for positioning, we propose a floor plan-assisted fusion positioning algorithm (FP-BP) using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR). In the considered system, a user holding a smartphone walks through a positioning area with BLE beacons installed on the ceiling, and can locate himself in real time. In particular, FP-BP consists of two phases. In the offline phase, FP-BP programmatically extracts map features from a stylized floor plan based on their binary masks, and constructs a mapping function to identify the corresponding map feature of any given position on the map. In the online phase, FP-BP continuously computes BLE positions and PDR results from BLE signals and smartphone sensors, where a novel grid-based maximum likelihood estimation (GML) algorithm is introduced to enhance BLE positioning. Then, a particle filter is used to fuse them and obtain an initial estimate. Finally, FP-BP performs post-position correction to obtain the final position based on its specific map feature. Experimental results show that FP-BP can achieve a real-time mean positioning accuracy of 1.19 m, representing an improvement of over 28% compared to existing floor plan-fused baseline algorithms.

Title: Traffic Congestion Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques
Authors: Rafed Muhammad Yasir, Moumita Asad, Naushin Nower, Mohammad Shoyaib
Abstract: The prediction of traffic congestion can serve a crucial role in making future decisions. Although many studies have been conducted regarding congestion, most of these could not cover all the important factors (e.g., weather conditions). We proposed a prediction model for traffic congestion that can predict congestion based on day, time and several weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity). To evaluate our model, it has been tested against the traffic data of New Delhi. With this model, congestion of a road can be predicted one week ahead with an average RMSE of 1.12. Therefore, this model can be used to take preventive measure beforehand.

Title: Large Banks and Systemic Risk: Insights from a Mean-Field Game Model
Authors: Yuanyuan Chang, Dena Firoozi, David Benatia
Abstract: This paper presents a dynamic game framework to analyze the role of large banks in interbank markets. By extending existing models, we incorporate a large bank as a dynamic decision-maker interacting with multiple small banks. Using the mean-field game methodology and convex analysis, best-response trading strategies are derived, leading to an approximate equilibrium for the interbank market. We investigate the influence of the large bank on the market stability by examining individual default probabilities and systemic risk, through the use of Monte Carlo simulations. Our findings reveal that, when the size of the major bank is not excessively large, it can positively contribute to market stability. However, there is also the potential for negative spillover effects in the event of default, leading to an increase in systemic risk. The magnitude of this impact is further influenced by the size and trading rate of the major bank. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the management of systemic risk in interbank markets.

Title: A Holistic Evaluation of Piano Sound Quality
Authors: Monan Zhou, Shangda Wu, Shaohua Ji, Zijin Li, Wei Li
Abstract: This paper aims to develop a holistic evaluation method for piano sound quality to assist in purchasing decisions. Unlike previous studies that focused on the effect of piano performance techniques on sound quality, this study evaluates the inherent sound quality of different pianos. To derive quality evaluation systems, the study uses subjective questionnaires based on a piano sound quality dataset. The method selects the optimal piano classification models by comparing the fine-tuning results of different pre-training models of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). To improve the interpretability of the models, the study applies Equivalent Rectangular Bandwidth (ERB) analysis. The results reveal that musically trained individuals are better able to distinguish between the sound quality differences of different pianos. The best fine-tuned CNN pre-trained backbone achieves a high accuracy of 98.3% as the piano classifier. However, the dataset is limited, and the audio is sliced to increase its quantity, resulting in a lack of diversity and balance, so we use focal loss to reduce the impact of data imbalance. To optimize the method, the dataset will be expanded, or few-shot learning techniques will be employed in future research.

Title: Energy-Aware Routing Algorithm for Mobile Ground-to-Air Charging
Authors: Bill Cai, Fei Lu, Lifeng Zhou
Abstract: We investigate the problem of energy-constrained planning for a cooperative system of an Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) and an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). In scenarios where the UGV serves as a mobile base to ferry the UAV and as a charging station to recharge the UAV, we formulate a novel energy-constrained routing problem. To tackle this problem, we design an energy-aware routing algorithm, aiming to minimize the overall mission duration under the energy limitations of both vehicles. The algorithm first solves a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) to generate a guided tour. Then, it employs the Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to refine the tour and generate paths for the two vehicles. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm through extensive simulations and a proof-of-concept experiment. The results show that our algorithm consistently achieves near-optimal mission time and maintains fast running time across a wide range of problem instances.

Title: Interpolatory model reduction of dynamical systems with root mean squared error
Authors: Sean Reiter, Steffen W. R. Werner
Abstract: The root mean squared error is an important measure used in a variety of applications such as structural dynamics and acoustics to model averaged deviations from standard behavior. For large-scale systems, simulations of this quantity quickly become computationally prohibitive. Classical model order reduction techniques attempt to resolve this issue via the construction of surrogate models that emulate the root mean squared error measure using an intermediate linear system. However, this approach requires a potentially large number of linear outputs, which can be disadvantageous in the design of reduced-order models. In this work, we consider directly the root mean squared error as the quantity of interest using the concept of quadratic-output models and propose several new model reduction techniques for the construction of appropriate surrogates. We test the proposed methods on a model for the vibrational response of a plate with tuned vibration absorbers.

Title: HyperFusion: A Hypernetwork Approach to Multimodal Integration of Tabular and Medical Imaging Data for Predictive Modeling
Authors: Daniel Duenias, Brennan Nichyporuk, Tal Arbel, Tammy Riklin Raviv
Abstract: The integration of diverse clinical modalities such as medical imaging and the tabular data extracted from patients' Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is a crucial aspect of modern healthcare. Integrative analysis of multiple sources can provide a comprehensive understanding of the clinical condition of a patient, improving diagnosis and treatment decision. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) consistently demonstrate outstanding performance in a wide range of multimodal tasks in the medical domain. However, the complex endeavor of effectively merging medical imaging with clinical, demographic and genetic information represented as numerical tabular data remains a highly active and ongoing research pursuit. We present a novel framework based on hypernetworks to fuse clinical imaging and tabular data by conditioning the image processing on the EHR's values and measurements. This approach aims to leverage the complementary information present in these modalities to enhance the accuracy of various medical applications. We demonstrate the strength and generality of our method on two different brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) analysis tasks, namely, brain age prediction conditioned by subject's sex and multi-class Alzheimer's Disease (AD) classification conditioned by tabular data. We show that our framework outperforms both single-modality models and state-of-the-art MRI tabular data fusion methods. A link to our code can be found at this https URL

Title: Potential Field Based Deep Metric Learning
Authors: Shubhang Bhatnagar, Narendra Ahuja
Abstract: Deep metric learning (DML) involves training a network to learn a semantically meaningful representation space. Many current approaches mine n-tuples of examples and model interactions within each tuplets. We present a novel, compositional DML model that instead of in tuples, represents the influence of each example (embedding) by a continuous potential field, and superposes the fields to obtain their combined global potential field. We use attractive/repulsive potential fields to represent interactions among embeddings from images of the same/different classes. Contrary to typical learning methods, where mutual influence of samples is proportional to their distance, we enforce reduction in such influence with distance, leading to a decaying field. We show that such decay helps improve performance on real world datasets with large intra-class variations and label noise. Like other proxy-based methods, we also use proxies to succinctly represent sub-populations of examples. We evaluate our method on three standard DML benchmarks- Cars-196, CUB-200-2011, and SOP datasets where it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Title: Enhancing Audio-Language Models through Self-Supervised Post-Training with Text-Audio Pairs
Authors: Anshuman Sinha, Camille Migozzi, Aubin Rey, Chao Zhang
Abstract: Research on multi-modal contrastive learning strategies for audio and text has rapidly gained interest. Contrastively trained Audio-Language Models (ALMs), such as CLAP, which establish a unified representation across audio and language modalities, have enhanced the efficacy in various subsequent tasks by providing good text aligned audio encoders and vice versa. These improvements are evident in areas like zero-shot audio classification and audio retrieval, among others. However, the ability of these models to understand natural language and temporal relations is still a largely unexplored and open field for research. In this paper, we propose to equip the multi-modal ALMs with temporal understanding without loosing their inherent prior capabilities of audio-language tasks with a temporal instillation method TeminAL. We implement a two-stage training scheme TeminAL A $\&$ B, where the model first learns to differentiate between multiple sounds in TeminAL A, followed by a phase that instills a sense of time, thereby enhancing its temporal understanding in TeminAL B. This approach results in an average performance gain of $5.28\%$ in temporal understanding on the ESC-50 dataset, while the model remains competitive in zero-shot retrieval and classification tasks on the AudioCap/Clotho datasets. We also note the lack of proper evaluation techniques for contrastive ALMs and propose a strategy for evaluating ALMs in zero-shot settings. The general-purpose zero-shot model evaluation strategy ZSTE, is used to evaluate various prior models. ZSTE demonstrates a general strategy to evaluate all ZS contrastive models. The model trained with TeminAL successfully outperforms current models on most downstream tasks.

Title: MoWE-Audio: Multitask AudioLLMs with Mixture of Weak Encoders
Authors: Wenyu Zhang, Shuo Sun, Bin Wang, Xunlong Zou, Zhuohan Liu, Yingxu He, Geyu Lin, Nancy F. Chen, Ai Ti Aw
Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced natural language processing capabilities, facilitating the development of AudioLLMs that process and understand speech and audio inputs alongside text. Existing AudioLLMs typically combine a pre-trained audio encoder with a pre-trained LLM, which are subsequently finetuned on specific audio tasks. However, the pre-trained audio encoder has constrained capacity to capture features for new tasks and datasets. To address this, we propose to incorporate mixtures of `weak' encoders (MoWE) into the AudioLLM framework. MoWE supplements a base encoder with a pool of relatively light weight encoders, selectively activated based on the audio input to enhance feature extraction without significantly increasing model size. Our empirical results demonstrate that MoWE effectively improves multi-task performance, broadening the applicability of AudioLLMs to more diverse audio tasks.

Title: LEO-based Positioning: Foundations, Signal Design, and Receiver Enhancements for 6G NTN
Authors: Harish K. Dureppagari, Chiranjib Saha, Harikumar Krishnamurthy, Xiao Feng Wang, Alberto Rico-Alvari√±o, R. Michael Buehrer, Harpreet S. Dhillon
Abstract: The integration of non-terrestrial networks (NTN) into 5G new radio (NR) has opened up the possibility of developing a new positioning infrastructure using NR signals from Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. Compared to existing Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), LEO-based cellular positioning offers several advantages, such as a superior link budget, higher operating bandwidth, and large forthcoming constellations. Due to these factors, LEO-based positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) is a potential enhancement for NTN in 6G cellular networks. However, extending the existing terrestrial cellular positioning methods to LEO-based NTN positioning requires key fundamental enhancements. These include creating broad positioning beams orthogonal to conventional communication beams, time-domain processing at the user equipment (UE) to resolve large delay and Doppler uncertainties, and efficiently accommodating positioning reference signals (PRS) from multiple satellites within the communication resource grid. In this paper, we present the first set of design insights by incorporating these enhancements and thoroughly evaluating LEO-based positioning, considering the constraints and capabilities of the NR-NTN physical layer. To evaluate the performance of LEO-based NTN positioning, we develop a comprehensive NR-compliant simulation framework, including LEO orbit simulation, transmission (Tx) and receiver (Rx) architectures, and a positioning engine incorporating the necessary enhancements. Our findings suggest that LEO-based NTN positioning could serve as a complementary infrastructure to GNSS and, with appropriate enhancements, may also offer a viable alternative.

Title: PK-YOLO: Pretrained Knowledge Guided YOLO for Brain Tumor Detection in Multiplanar MRI Slices
Authors: Ming Kang, Fung Fung Ting, Rapha√´l C.-W. Phan, Chee-Ming Ting
Abstract: Brain tumor detection in multiplane Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) slices is a challenging task due to the various appearances and relationships in the structure of the multiplane images. In this paper, we propose a new You Only Look Once (YOLO)-based detection model that incorporates Pretrained Knowledge (PK), called PK-YOLO, to improve the performance for brain tumor detection in multiplane MRI slices. To our best knowledge, PK-YOLO is the first pretrained knowledge guided YOLO-based object detector. The main components of the new method are a pretrained pure lightweight convolutional neural network-based backbone via sparse masked modeling, a YOLO architecture with the pretrained backbone, and a regression loss function for improving small object detection. The pretrained backbone allows for feature transferability of object queries on individual plane MRI slices into the model encoders, and the learned domain knowledge base can improve in-domain detection. The improved loss function can further boost detection performance on small-size brain tumors in multiplanar two-dimensional MRI slices. Experimental results show that the proposed PK-YOLO achieves competitive performance on the multiplanar MRI brain tumor detection datasets compared to state-of-the-art YOLO-like and DETR-like object detectors.

Title: System-Level Experimental Evaluation of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces for NextG Communication Systems
Authors: Maria Tsampazi, Tommaso Melodia
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are a promising technique for enhancing the performance of Next Generation (NextG) wireless communication systems in terms of both spectral and energy efficiency, as well as resource utilization. However, current RIS research has primarily focused on theoretical modeling and Physical (PHY) layer considerations only. Full protocol stack emulation and accurate modeling of the propagation characteristics of the wireless channel are necessary for studying the benefits introduced by RIS technology across various spectrum bands and use-cases. In this paper, we propose, for the first time: (i) accurate PHY layer RIS-enabled channel modeling through Geometry-Based Stochastic Models (GBSMs), leveraging the QUAsi Deterministic RadIo channel GenerAtor (QuaDRiGa) open-source statistical ray-tracer; (ii) optimized resource allocation with RISs by comprehensively studying energy efficiency and power control on different portions of the spectrum through a single-leader multiple-followers Stackelberg game theoretical approach; (iii) full-stack emulation and performance evaluation of RIS-assisted channels with SCOPE/srsRAN for Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) and Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communications (URLLC) applications in the worlds largest emulator of wireless systems with hardware-in-the-loop, namely Colosseum. Our findings indicate (i) the significant power savings in terms of energy efficiency achieved with RIS-assisted topologies, especially in the millimeter wave (mmWave) band; and (ii) the benefits introduced for Sub-6 GHz band User Equipments (UEs), where the deployment of a relatively small RIS (e.g., in the order of 100 RIS elements) can result in decreased levels of latency for URLLC services in resource-constrained environments.

Authors: Florian Kaltenberger, Tommaso Melodia, Irfan Ghauri, Michele Polese, Raymond Knopp, Tien Thinh Nguyen, Sakthivel Velumani, Davide Villa, Leonardo Bonati, Robert Schmidt, Sagar Arora, Mikel Irazabal, Navid Nikaein
Abstract: The development of 6G wireless technologies is rapidly advancing, with the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) entering the pre-standardization phase and aiming to deliver the first specifications by 2028. This paper explores the OpenAirInterface (OAI) project, an open-source initiative that plays a crucial role in the evolution of 5G and future 6G networks. OAI provides a comprehensive implementation of 3GPP and O-RAN compliant networks, including Radio Access Network (RAN), Core Network (CN), and software-defined User Equipment (UE) components. This paper details the history and evolution of OAI, its licensing model, and the various projects under its umbrella, such as RAN, the CN, and the Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) projects. It also highlights the development methodology, Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) processes, and end-to-end systems powered by OAI. Furthermore, the paper discusses the potential of OAI for 6G research, focusing on spectrum, reflective intelligent surfaces, and Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) integration. The open-source approach of OAI is emphasized as essential for tackling the challenges of 6G, fostering community collaboration, and driving innovation in next-generation wireless technologies.

Title: Adaptive Control of Positive Systems with Application to Learning SSP
Authors: Fethi Bencherki, Anders Rantzer
Abstract: An adaptive controller is proposed and analyzed for the class of infinite-horizon optimal control problems in positive linear systems presented in (Ohlin et al., 2024b). This controller is derived from the solution of a "data-driven algebraic equation" constructed using the model-free Bellman equation from Q-learning. The equation is driven by data correlation matrices that do not scale with the number of data points, enabling efficient online implementation. Consequently, a sufficient condition guaranteeing stability and robustness to unmodeled dynamics is established. The derived results also provide a quantitative characterization of the interplay between excitation level and robustness to unmodeled dynamics. The class of optimal control problems considered here is equivalent to Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problems, allowing for a performance comparison between the proposed adaptive policy and model-free algorithms for learning the stochastic shortest path, as demonstrated in the numerical experiment.

Title: Hybrid Beamforming Design for RSMA-enabled Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communications
Authors: Jiasi Zhou, Chintha Tellambura, Geoffrey Ye Li
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks leverage extremely large antenna arrays and high frequencies. This inevitably extends the Rayleigh distance, making near-field (NF) spherical wave propagation dominant. This unlocks numerous spatial degrees of freedom, raising the challenge of optimizing them for communication and sensing tradeoffs. To this end, we propose a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-based NF-ISAC transmit scheme utilizing hybrid analog-digital antennas. RSMA enhances interference management, while a variable number of dedicated sensing beams adds beamforming flexibility. The objective is to maximize the minimum communication rate while ensuring multi-target sensing performance by jointly optimizing receive filters, analog and digital beamformers, common rate allocation, and the sensing beam count. To address uncertainty in sensing beam allocation, a rank-zero solution reconstruction method demonstrates that dedicated sensing beams are unnecessary for NF multi-target detection. A penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based double-loop algorithm is introduced, employing weighted minimum mean-squared error (WMMSE) and quadratic transforms to reformulate communication and sensing rates. Simulations reveal that the proposed scheme: 1) achieves performance comparable to fully digital beamforming with fewer RF chains, (2) maintains NF multi-target detection without compromising communication rates, and 3) significantly outperforms conventional multiple access schemes and far-field ISAC systems.

Title: DLEN: Dual Branch of Transformer for Low-Light Image Enhancement in Dual Domains
Authors: Junyu Xia, Jiesong Bai, Yihang Dong
Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLE) aims to improve the visual quality of images captured in poorly lit conditions, which often suffer from low brightness, low contrast, noise, and color distortions. These issues hinder the performance of computer vision tasks such as object detection, facial recognition, and autonomous this http URL enhancement techniques, such as multi-scale fusion and histogram equalization, fail to preserve fine details and often struggle with maintaining the natural appearance of enhanced images under complex lighting conditions. Although the Retinex theory provides a foundation for image decomposition, it often amplifies noise, leading to suboptimal image quality. In this paper, we propose the Dual Light Enhance Network (DLEN), a novel architecture that incorporates two distinct attention mechanisms, considering both spatial and frequency domains. Our model introduces a learnable wavelet transform module in the illumination estimation phase, preserving high- and low-frequency components to enhance edge and texture details. Additionally, we design a dual-branch structure that leverages the power of the Transformer architecture to enhance both the illumination and structural components of the this http URL extensive experiments, our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard this http URL is available here: this https URL

Title: Engineering-Oriented Design of Drift-Resilient MTJ Random Number Generator via Hybrid Control Strategies
Authors: Ran Zhang, Caihua Wan, Yingqian Xu, Xiaohan Li, Raik Hoffmann, Meike Hindenberg, Shiqiang Liu, Dehao Kong, Shilong Xiong, Shikun He, Alptekin Vardar, Qiang Dai, Junlu Gong, Yihui Sun, Zejie Zheng, Thomas K√§mpfe, Guoqiang Yu, Xiufeng Han
Abstract: Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs) have shown great promise as hardware sources for true random number generation (TRNG) due to their intrinsic stochastic switching behavior. However, practical deployment remains challenged by drift in switching probability caused by thermal fluctuations, device aging, and environmental instability. This work presents an engineering-oriented, drift-resilient MTJ-based TRNG architecture, enabled by a hybrid control strategy that combines self-stabilizing feedback with pulse width modulation. A key component is the Downcalibration-2 scheme, which updates the control parameter every two steps using only integer-resolution timing, ensuring excellent statistical quality without requiring bit discarding, pre-characterization, or external calibration. Extensive experimental measurements and numerical simulations demonstrate that this approach maintains stable randomness under dynamic temperature drift, using only simple digital logic. The proposed architecture offers high throughput, robustness, and scalability, making it well-suited for secure hardware applications, embedded systems, and edge computing environments.

Title: Impact of Optic Nerve Tortuosity, Globe Proptosis, and Size on Retinal Ganglion Cell Thickness Across General, Glaucoma, and Myopic Populations: Insights from the UK Biobank
Authors: Charis Y.N. Chiang, Xiaofei Wang, Stuart K. Gardiner, Martin Buist, Michael J.A. Girard
Abstract: Purpose: To investigate the impact of optic nerve tortuosity (ONT), and the interaction of globe proptosis and globe size on retinal ganglion cell (RGC) thickness, using Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL) thickness, across general, glaucoma, and myopic populations. Methods: We analyzed 17,940 eyes from the UKBiobank cohort (ID 76442), including 72 glaucoma and 2475 myopic eyes. AI models segmented structures from 3D optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans and magnetic resonance images (MRI). RNFL thickness was derived from OCT scans and corrected for ocular magnification, was derived from OCT. From MRIs, we extracted: ONT, globe proptosis, axial length, and a novel interzygomatic line-to-posterior pole (ILPP) distance, a composite marker of globe proptosis and size. GEE models assessed associations between orbital and retinal features across all populations. Results: Segmentation models achieved Dice coefficients over 0.94 for both MRI and OCT. RNFL thickness was positively correlated with both ONT and ILPP distance (r = 0.065, p < 0.001, and r = 0.206, p < 0.001 respectively). The same was true for glaucoma (r = 0.040, p = 0.74, and r = 0.224, p = 0.059), and for myopia (r = 0.069, p < 0.001, and r = 0.100, p < 0.0001). GEE models revealed straighter optic nerves and shorter ILPP distance as predictive of thinner RNFL in all populations. Conclusions: This study emphasizes the impact of ONT, globe size, and proptosis on retinal health, suggesting RNFL thinning may arise from biomechanical stress due to straighter optic nerves or reduced ILPP distance, particularly in glaucoma or myopia. The novel ILPP metric, integrating globe size and position, shows potential as a biomarker for axonal health. These findings highlight the role of orbit structures in RGC axonal health and warrant further exploration of the biomechanical relationship between the orbit and optic nerve.

Title: A Bayesian Interpretation of the Internal Model Principle
Authors: Manuel Baltieri, Martin Biehl, Matteo Capucci, Nathaniel Virgo
Abstract: The internal model principle, originally proposed in the theory of control of linear systems, nowadays represents a more general class of results in control theory and cybernetics. The central claim of these results is that, under suitable assumptions, if a system (a controller) can regulate against a class of external inputs (from the environment), it is because the system contains a model of the system causing these inputs, which can be used to generate signals counteracting them. Similar claims on the role of internal models appear also in cognitive science, especially in modern Bayesian treatments of cognitive agents, often suggesting that a system (a human subject, or some other agent) models its environment to adapt against disturbances and perform goal-directed behaviour. It is however unclear whether the Bayesian internal models discussed in cognitive science bear any formal relation to the internal models invoked in standard treatments of control theory. Here, we first review the internal model principle and present a precise formulation of it using concepts inspired by categorical systems theory. This leads to a formal definition of ``model'' generalising its use in the internal model principle. Although this notion of model is not a priori related to the notion of Bayesian reasoning, we show that it can be seen as a special case of possibilistic Bayesian filtering. This result is based on a recent line of work formalising, using Markov categories, a notion of ``interpretation'', describing when a system can be interpreted as performing Bayesian filtering on an outside world in a consistent way.

Title: A Predictive Services Architecture for Efficient Airspace Operations
Authors: √çtalo Romani de Oliveira, Samet Ayhan, Glaucia Balvedi, Michael Biglin, Pablo Costas, Euclides C. Pinto Neto, Alexandre Leite, Felipe C. F. de Azevedo
Abstract: Predicting air traffic congestion and flow management is essential for airlines and Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSP) to enhance operational efficiency. Accurate estimates of future airport capacity and airspace density are vital for better airspace management, reducing air traffic controller workload and fuel consumption, ultimately promoting sustainable aviation. While existing literature has addressed these challenges, data management and query processing remain complex due to the vast volume of high-rate air traffic data. Many analytics use cases require a common pre-processing infrastructure, as ad-hoc approaches are insufficient. Additionally, linear prediction models often fall short, necessitating more advanced techniques. This paper presents a data processing and predictive services architecture that ingests large, uncorrelated, and noisy streaming data to forecast future airspace system states. The system continuously collects raw data, periodically compresses it, and stores it in NoSQL databases for efficient query processing. For prediction, the system learns from historical traffic by extracting key features such as airport arrival and departure events, sector boundary crossings, weather parameters, and other air traffic data. These features are input into various regression models, including linear, non-linear, and ensemble models, with the best-performing model selected for predictions. We evaluate this infrastructure across three prediction use cases in the US National Airspace System (NAS) and a segment of European airspace, using extensive real operations data, confirming that our system can predict future system states efficiently and accurately.

Title: Graph-Based Prediction Models for Data Debiasing
Authors: Dongze Wu, Hanyang Jiang, Yao Xie
Abstract: Bias in data collection, arising from both under-reporting and over-reporting, poses significant challenges in critical applications such as healthcare and public safety. In this work, we introduce Graph-based Over- and Under-reporting Debiasing (GROUD), a novel graph-based optimization framework that debiases reported data by jointly estimating the true incident counts and the associated reporting bias probabilities. By modeling the bias as a smooth signal over a graph constructed from geophysical or feature-based similarities, our convex formulation not only ensures a unique solution but also comes with theoretical recovery guarantees under certain assumptions. We validate GROUD on both challenging simulated experiments and real-world datasets -- including Atlanta emergency calls and COVID-19 vaccine adverse event reports -- demonstrating its robustness and superior performance in accurately recovering debiased counts. This approach paves the way for more reliable downstream decision-making in systems affected by reporting irregularities.

Title: SegOTA: Accelerating Over-the-Air Federated Learning with Segmented Transmission
Authors: Chong Zhang, Min Dong, Ben Liang, Ali Afana, Yahia Ahmed
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) with over-the-air computation efficiently utilizes the communication resources, but it can still experience significant latency when each device transmits a large number of model parameters to the server. This paper proposes the Segmented Over-The-Air (SegOTA) method for FL, which reduces latency by partitioning devices into groups and letting each group transmit only one segment of the model parameters in each communication round. Considering a multi-antenna server, we model the SegOTA transmission and reception process to establish an upper bound on the expected model learning optimality gap. We minimize this upper bound, by formulating the per-round online optimization of device grouping and joint transmit-receive beamforming, for which we derive efficient closed-form solutions. Simulation results show that our proposed SegOTA substantially outperforms the conventional full-model OTA approach and other common alternatives.

Title: A comprehensive review of remote sensing in wetland classification and mapping
Authors: Shuai Yuan, Xiangan Liang, Tianwu Lin, Shuang Chen, Rui Liu, Jie Wang, Hongsheng Zhang, Peng Gong
Abstract: Wetlands constitute critical ecosystems that support both biodiversity and human well-being; however, they have experienced a significant decline since the 20th century. Back in the 1970s, researchers began to employ remote sensing technologies for wetland classification and mapping to elucidate the extent and variations of wetlands. Although some review articles summarized the development of this field, there is a lack of a thorough and in-depth understanding of wetland classification and mapping: (1) the scientific importance of wetlands, (2) major data, methods used in wetland classification and mapping, (3) driving factors of wetland changes, (4) current research paradigm and limitations, (5) challenges and opportunities in wetland classification and mapping under the context of technological innovation and global environmental change. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive perspective and new insights into wetland classification and mapping for readers to answer these questions. First, we conduct a meta-analysis of over 1,200 papers, encompassing wetland types, methods, sensor types, and study sites, examining prevailing trends in wetland classification and mapping. Next, we review and synthesize the wetland features and existing data and methods in wetland classification and mapping. We also summarize typical wetland mapping products and explore the intrinsic driving factors of wetland changes across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Finally, we discuss current limitations and propose future directions in response to global environmental change and technological innovation. This review consolidates our understanding of wetland remote sensing and offers scientific recommendations that foster transformative progress in wetland science.

Title: MultiCore+TPU Accelerated Multi-Modal TinyML for Livestock Behaviour Recognition
Authors: Qianxue Zhang, Eiman Kanjo
Abstract: The advancement of technology has revolutionised the agricultural industry, transitioning it from labour-intensive farming practices to automated, AI-powered management systems. In recent years, more intelligent livestock monitoring solutions have been proposed to enhance farming efficiency and productivity. This work presents a novel approach to animal activity recognition and movement tracking, leveraging tiny machine learning (TinyML) techniques, wireless communication framework, and microcontroller platforms to develop an efficient, cost-effective livestock sensing system. It collects and fuses accelerometer data and vision inputs to build a multi-modal network for three tasks: image classification, object detection, and behaviour recognition. The system is deployed and evaluated on commercial microcontrollers for real-time inference using embedded applications, demonstrating up to 270$\times$ model size reduction, less than 80ms response latency, and on-par performance comparable to existing methods. The incorporation of the TinyML technique allows for seamless data transmission between devices, benefiting use cases in remote locations with poor Internet connectivity. This work delivers a robust, scalable IoT-edge livestock monitoring solution adaptable to diverse farming needs, offering flexibility for future extensions.

Abstract: This paper reviews the NTIRE 2025 Challenge on Day and Night Raindrop Removal for Dual-Focused Images. This challenge received a wide range of impressive solutions, which are developed and evaluated using our collected real-world Raindrop Clarity dataset. Unlike existing deraining datasets, our Raindrop Clarity dataset is more diverse and challenging in degradation types and contents, which includes day raindrop-focused, day background-focused, night raindrop-focused, and night background-focused degradations. This dataset is divided into three subsets for competition: 14,139 images for training, 240 images for validation, and 731 images for testing. The primary objective of this challenge is to establish a new and powerful benchmark for the task of removing raindrops under varying lighting and focus conditions. There are a total of 361 participants in the competition, and 32 teams submitting valid solutions and fact sheets for the final testing phase. These submissions achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the Raindrop Clarity dataset. The project can be found at this https URL.
