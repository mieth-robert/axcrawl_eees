Title: Do Segmentation Models Understand Vascular Structure? A Blob-Based XAI Framework
Authors: Guillaume Garret, Antoine Vacavant, Carole Frindel
Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved impressive performance in medical image segmentation, yet their black-box nature limits clinical adoption. In vascular applications, trustworthy segmentation should rely on both local image cues and global anatomical structures, such as vessel connectivity or branching. However, the extent to which models leverage such global context remains unclear. We present a novel explainability pipeline for 3D vessel segmentation, combining gradient-based attribution with graph-guided point selection and a blob-based analysis of Saliency maps. Using vascular graphs extracted from ground truth, we define anatomically meaningful points of interest (POIs) and assess the contribution of input voxels via Saliency maps. These are analyzed at both global and local scales using a custom blob detector. Applied to IRCAD and Bullitt datasets, our analysis shows that model decisions are dominated by highly localized attribution blobs centered near POIs. Attribution features show little correlation with vessel-level properties such as thickness, tubularity, or connectivity -- suggesting limited use of global anatomical reasoning. Our results underline the importance of structured explainability tools and highlight the current limitations of segmentation models in capturing global vascular context.

Title: Local Temporal Feature Enhanced Transformer with ROI-rank Based Masking for Diagnosis of ADHD
Authors: Byunggun Kim, Younghun Kwon
Abstract: In modern society, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the common mental diseases discovered not only in children but also in adults. In this context, we propose a ADHD diagnosis transformer model that can effectively simultaneously find important brain spatiotemporal biomarkers from resting-state functional magnetic resonance (rs-fMRI). This model not only learns spatiotemporal individual features but also learns the correlation with full attention structures specialized in ADHD diagnosis. In particular, it focuses on learning local blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals and distinguishing important regions of interest (ROI) in the brain. Specifically, the three proposed methods for ADHD diagnosis transformer are as follows. First, we design a CNN-based embedding block to obtain more expressive embedding features in brain region attention. It is reconstructed based on the previously CNN-based ADHD diagnosis models for the transformer. Next, for individual spatiotemporal feature attention, we change the attention method to local temporal attention and ROI-rank based masking. For the temporal features of fMRI, the local temporal attention enables to learn local BOLD signal features with only simple window masking. For the spatial feature of fMRI, ROI-rank based masking can distinguish ROIs with high correlation in ROI relationships based on attention scores, thereby providing a more specific biomarker for ADHD diagnosis. The experiment was conducted with various types of transformer models. To evaluate these models, we collected the data from 939 individuals from all sites provided by the ADHD-200 competition. Through this, the spatiotemporal enhanced transformer for ADHD diagnosis outperforms the performance of other different types of transformer variants. (77.78ACC 76.60SPE 79.22SEN 79.30AUC)

Title: Deciphering scrolls with tomography: A training experiment
Authors: Sonia Foschiatti, Axel Kittenberger, Otmar Scherzer
Abstract: The recovery of severely damaged ancient written documents has proven to be a major challenge for many scientists, mainly due to the impracticality of physical unwrapping them. Non-destructive techniques, such as X-ray computed tomography (CT), combined with computer vision algorithms, have emerged as a means of facilitating the virtual reading of the hidden contents of the damaged documents. This paper proposes an educational laboratory aimed at simulating the entire process of acquisition and virtual recovery of the ancient works. We have developed an experimental setup that uses visible light to replace the detrimental X-rays, and a didactic software pipeline that allows students to virtually reconstruct a transparent rolled sheet with printed text on it, the wrapped scroll.

Authors: Mansoor Hayat, Supavadee Aramvith, Subrata Bhattacharjee, Nouman Ahmad
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of abdominal adipose tissue, including subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT), along with liver segmentation, is essential for understanding body composition and associated health risks such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This study proposes Attention GhostUNet++, a novel deep learning model incorporating Channel, Spatial, and Depth Attention mechanisms into the Ghost UNet++ bottleneck for automated, precise segmentation. Evaluated on the AATTCT-IDS and LiTS datasets, the model achieved Dice coefficients of 0.9430 for VAT, 0.9639 for SAT, and 0.9652 for liver segmentation, surpassing baseline models. Despite minor limitations in boundary detail segmentation, the proposed model significantly enhances feature refinement, contextual understanding, and computational efficiency, offering a robust solution for body composition analysis.

Title: Learned enclosure method for experimental EIT data
Authors: Sara Sippola, Siiri Rautio, Andreas Hauptmann, Takanori Ide, Samuli Siltanen
Abstract: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive imaging method with diverse applications, including medical imaging and non-destructive testing. The inverse problem of reconstructing internal electrical conductivity from boundary measurements is nonlinear and highly ill-posed, making it difficult to solve accurately. In recent years, there has been growing interest in combining analytical methods with machine learning to solve inverse problems. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating the convex hull of inclusions from boundary measurements by combining the enclosure method proposed by Ikehata with neural networks. We demonstrate its performance using experimental data. Compared to the classical enclosure method with least squares fitting, the learned convex hull achieves superior performance on both simulated and experimental data.

Title: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Decentralized Reservoir Management via Murmuration Intelligence
Authors: Heming Fu, Guojun Xiong, Jian Li, Shan Lin
Abstract: Conventional centralized water management systems face critical limitations from computational complexity and uncertainty propagation. We present MurmuRL, a novel decentralized framework inspired by starling murmurations intelligence, integrating bio-inspired alignment, separation, and cohesion rules with multi-agent reinforcement learning. MurmuRL enables individual reservoirs to make autonomous local decisions while achieving emergent global coordination. Experiments on grid networks demonstrate that MurmuRL achieves 8.8% higher final performance while using 27% less computing overhead compared to centralized approaches. Notably, strategic diversity scales super-linearly with system size, exhibiting sophisticated coordination patterns and enhanced resilience during extreme events. MurmuRL offers a scalable solution for managing complex water systems by leveraging principles of natural collective behavior.

Title: Accelerated Recovery with RIS: Designing Wireless Resilience in Mission-Critical Environments
Authors: Kevin Weinberger, Robert-Jeron Reifert, Aydin Sezgin, Mehdi Bennis
Abstract: As 6G and beyond redefine connectivity, wireless networks become the foundation of critical operations, making resilience more essential than ever. With this shift, wireless systems cannot only take on vital services previously handled by wired infrastructures but also enable novel innovative applications that would not be possible with wired systems. As a result, there is a pressing demand for strategies that can adapt to dynamic channel conditions, interference, and unforeseen disruptions, ensuring seamless and reliable performance in an increasingly complex environment. Despite considerable research, existing resilience assessments lack comprehensive key performance indicators (KPIs), especially those quantifying its adaptability, which are vital for identifying a system's capacity to rapidly adapt and reallocate resources. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing a novel framework that explicitly quantifies the adaption performance by augmenting the gradient of the system's rate function. To further enhance the network resilience, we integrate Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) into our framework due to their capability to dynamically reshape the propagation environment while providing alternative channel paths. Numerical results show that gradient augmentation enhances resilience by improving adaptability under adverse conditions while proactively preparing for future disruptions.

Title: Provably Safe Control for Constrained Nonlinear Systems with Bounded Input
Authors: Saurabh Kumar, Shashi Ranjan Kumar, Abhinav Sinha
Abstract: In real-world control applications, actuator constraints and output constraints (specifically in tracking problems) are inherent and critical to ensuring safe and reliable operation. However, generally, control strategies often neglect these physical limitations, leading to potential instability, degraded performance, or even system failure when deployed on real-world systems. This paper addresses the control design problem for a class of nonlinear systems under both actuator saturation and output constraints. First, a smooth asymmetric saturation model (a more generic representative of practical scenarios) is proposed to model actuator saturation, which ensures that the control inputs always remain confined within a predefined set to ensure safety. Based on the proposed model, we develop a nonlinear control framework that guarantees output tracking while ensuring that system output remains confined to the predefined set. Later, we integrate this design with the constrained output tracking control problem, wherein we show that the system output tracks its desired trajectory by simultaneously satisfying input and output constraints. The global stabilization of the tracking error is achieved in the presence of input constraints, while semi-global stabilization is achieved in the presence of both input and output constraints. Additionally, we rigorously establish the boundedness of all closed-loop signals under the proposed design. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in handling asymmetric constraints while achieving desirable tracking performance.

Title: Comprehensive Signal Modeling for Talkative Power Conversion
Authors: Jan Mietzner, Cerikh Chakraborty, Peter A. Hoeher, Lutz Lampe
Abstract: Talkative power conversion is a switching ripple communication technique that integrates data modulation into a switched-mode power electronics converter, enabling simultaneous information transmission and power conversion. Despite numerous research papers published over the last decade on various theoretical and practical aspects of this emerging topic, thorough signal modeling suitable for analysis and computer simulations is still lacking. In this article, we derive the continuous-time output voltage of a DC/DC switched-mode power electronics converter for a broad range of pulsed-based modulation schemes. We also develop corresponding discrete-time signal models and assess their accuracies. Finally, we devise a generic end-to-end signal model for arbitrary modulation signals, discuss implications of continuous-time and discrete-time signal modeling on equalization, and consider generalizations to include parasitic effects as well as the influence of general impedance loads.

Title: Verifiable Mission Planning For Space Operations
Authors: Quentin Rommel, Michael Hibbard, Pavan Shukla, Himanshu Save, Srinivas Bettadpur, Ufuk Topcu
Abstract: As space missions become more complex, planning methods must maximize mission performance while rigorously enforcing safety. We develop a probabilistic approach based on a finite-horizon Markov decision process to optimize spacecraft operations planning with safety guarantees. In the model, states capture essential mission parameters, and actions represent the operational adjustments needed to meet mission objectives. By directly incorporating uncertainties from environmental conditions and spacecraft dynamics, an optimal sequence of actions is computed that maximizes expected rewards and strictly enforces safety constraints. Numerical experiments on the GRACE-FO mission demonstrate robust performance under uncertainties while providing probabilistic safety guarantees, offering a reliable solution for autonomous spacecraft operations.

Title: An Energy-efficient Ordered Transmission-based Sequential Estimation
Authors: Chen Quan, Geethu Joseph, Nitin Jonathan Myers
Abstract: Estimation problems in wireless sensor networks typically involve gathering and processing data from distributed sensors to infer the state of an environment at the fusion center. However, not all measurements contribute significantly to improving estimation accuracy. The ordered transmission protocol, a promising approach for enhancing energy efficiency in wireless networks, allows for the selection of measurements from different sensors to ensure the desired estimation quality. In this work, we use the idea of ordered transmission to reduce the number of transmissions required for sequential estimation within a network, thereby achieving energy-efficient estimation. We derive a new stopping rule that minimizes the number of transmissions while maintaining estimation accuracy similar to general sequential estimation with unordered transmissions. Moreover, we derive the expected number of transmissions required for both general sequential estimation with unordered transmissions and proposed sequential estimation with ordered transmissions and make a comparison between the two systems. Simulation results indicate that our proposed scheme can efficiently reduce transmissions while still ensuring the quality of estimation.

Title: Data driven approach towards more efficient Newton-Raphson power flow calculation for distribution grids
Authors: Shengyuan Yan, Farzad Vazinram, Zeynab Kaseb, Lindsay Spoor, Jochen Stiasny, Betul Mamudi, Amirhossein Heydarian Ardakani, Ugochukwu Orji, Pedro P. Vergara, Yu Xiang, Jerry Guo
Abstract: Power flow (PF) calculations are fundamental to power system analysis to ensure stable and reliable grid operation. The Newton-Raphson (NR) method is commonly used for PF analysis due to its rapid convergence when initialized properly. However, as power grids operate closer to their capacity limits, ill-conditioned cases and convergence issues pose significant challenges. This work, therefore, addresses these challenges by proposing strategies to improve NR initialization, hence minimizing iterations and avoiding divergence. We explore three approaches: (i) an analytical method that estimates the basin of attraction using mathematical bounds on voltages, (ii) Two data-driven models leveraging supervised learning or physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to predict optimal initial guesses, and (iii) a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that incrementally adjusts voltages to accelerate convergence. These methods are tested on benchmark systems. This research is particularly relevant for modern power systems, where high penetration of renewables and decentralized generation require robust and scalable PF solutions. In experiments, all three proposed methods demonstrate a strong ability to provide an initial guess for Newton-Raphson method to converge with fewer steps. The findings provide a pathway for more efficient real-time grid operations, which, in turn, support the transition toward smarter and more resilient electricity networks.

Title: Reachability Analysis of Nonlinear Discrete-Time Systems Using Polyhedral Relaxations and Constrained Zonotopes
Authors: Brenner S. Rego, Guilherme V. Raffo, Marco H. Terra, Joseph K. Scott
Abstract: This paper presents a novel algorithm for reachability analysis of nonlinear discrete-time systems. The proposed method combines constrained zonotopes (CZs) with polyhedral relaxations of factorable representations of nonlinear functions to propagate CZs through nonlinear functions, which is normally done using conservative linearization techniques. The new propagation method provides better approximations than those resulting from linearization procedures, leading to significant improvements in the computation of reachable sets in comparison to other CZ methods from the literature. Numerical examples highlight the advantages of the proposed algorithm.

Title: Optimal SVI-Weighted PSPS Decisions with Decision-Dependent Outage Uncertainty
Authors: Ryan Greenough, Kohei Murakami, Jan Kleissl, Adil Khurram
Abstract: Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS) are a pre-emptive strategy to mitigate the wildfires caused by power system malfunction. System operators implement PSPS to balance wildfire mitigation efforts through de-energization of transmission lines against the risk of widespread blackouts modeled with load shedding. Existing approaches do not incorporate decision-dependent wildfire-driven failure probabilities, as modeling outage scenario probabilities requires incorporating high-order polynomial terms in the objective. This paper uses distribution shaping to develop an efficient MILP problem representation of the distributionally robust PSPS problem. Building upon the author's prior work, the wildfire risk of operating a transmission line is a function of the probability of a wildfire-driven outage and its subsequent expected impact in acres burned. A day-ahead unit commitment and line de-energization PSPS framework is used to assess the trade-off between total cost and wildfire risk at different levels of distributional robustness, parameterized by a level of distributional dissimilarity $\kappa$. We perform simulations on the IEEE RTS 24-bus test system.

Title: ESC-MVQ: End-to-End Semantic Communication With Multi-Codebook Vector Quantization
Authors: Junyong Shin, Yongjeong Oh, Jinsung Park, Joohyuk Park, Yo-Seb Jeon
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel end-to-end digital semantic communication framework based on multi-codebook vector quantization (VQ), referred to as ESC-MVQ. Unlike prior approaches that rely on end-to-end training with a specific power or modulation scheme, often under a particular channel condition, ESC-MVQ models a channel transfer function as parallel binary symmetric channels (BSCs) with trainable bit-flip probabilities. Building on this model, ESC-MVQ jointly trains multiple VQ codebooks and their associated bit-flip probabilities with a single encoder-decoder pair. To maximize inference performance when deploying ESC-MVQ in digital communication systems, we devise an optimal communication strategy that jointly optimizes codebook assignment, adaptive modulation, and power allocation. To this end, we develop an iterative algorithm that selects the most suitable VQ codebook for semantic features and flexibly allocates power and modulation schemes across the transmitted symbols. Simulation results demonstrate that ESC-MVQ, using a single encoder-decoder pair, outperforms existing digital semantic communication methods in both performance and memory efficiency, offering a scalable and adaptive solution for realizing digital semantic communication in diverse channel conditions.

Title: EdgePrompt: A Distributed Key-Value Inference Framework for LLMs in 6G Networks
Authors: Jiahong Ning, Pengyan Zhu, Ce Zheng, Gary Lee, Sumei Sun, Tingting Yang
Abstract: As sixth-generation (6G) networks advance, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into 6G infrastructure to enhance network management and intelligence. However, traditional LLMs architecture struggle to meet the stringent latency and security requirements of 6G, especially as the increasing in sequence length leads to greater task complexity. This paper proposes Edge-Prompt, a cloud-edge collaborative framework based on a hierarchical attention splicing mechanism. EdgePrompt employs distributed key-value (KV) pair optimization techniques to accelerate inference and adapt to network conditions. Additionally, to reduce the risk of data leakage, EdgePrompt incorporates a privacy preserving strategy by isolating sensitive information during processing. Experiments on public dataset show that EdgePrompt effectively improves the inference throughput and reduces the latency, which provides a reliable solution for LLMs deployment in 6G environments.

Title: HyperKING: Quantum-Classical Generative Adversarial Networks for Hyperspectral Image Restoration
Authors: Chia-Hsiang Lin, Si-Sheng Young
Abstract: Quantum machine intelligence starts showing its impact on satellite remote sensing (SRS). Also, recent literature exhibits that quantum generative intelligences encompass superior potential than their classical counterpart, motivating us to develop quantum generative adversarial networks (GANs) for SRS. However, existing quantum GANs are restricted by the limited quantum bit (qubit) resources of current quantum computers and process merely a small 2x2 grayscale image, far from being applicable to SRS. Recently, the novel concept of hybrid quantum-classical GAN, a quantum generator with a classical discriminator, has upgraded the order to 28x28 (still grayscale), whereas it is still insufficient for SRS. This motivates us to design a radically new hybrid framework, where both generator and discriminator are hybrid architectures. We demonstrate this feasibility, leading to a breakthrough of processing 128x128 hyperspectral images for SRS. Specifically, we design the quantum part with mathematically provable quantum full expressibility (FE) to address core signal processing tasks, wherein the FE property allows the quantum network to realize any valid quantum operator with appropriate training. The classical part, composed of convolutional layers, treats the read-in (compressing the optical information into limited qubits) and read-out (addressing the quantum collapse effect) procedures. The proposed innovative hybrid quantum GAN, named Hyperspectral Knot-like IntelligeNt dIscrimiNator and Generator (HyperKING), where knot partly symbolizes the quantum entanglement and partly the compressed quantum domain in the central part of the network architecture. HyperKING significantly surpasses the classical approaches in hyperspectral tensor completion, mixed noise removal (about 3dB improvement), and blind source separation results.

Title: Analysis of Power Swing Characteristics of Grid-Forming VSC System Considering the Current Limitation Mode
Authors: Yongxin Xiong, Heng Wu, Yifei Li, Xiongfei Wang
Abstract: This paper investigates power swing characteristics of grid-forming voltage source converter (GFM-VSC) systems considering the current limitation mode in both non-inertial and inertial GFM-VSC systems. Following grid faults, non-inertial GFM-VSC systems can re-synchronize with the grid but may experience significant power swings driven by its control dynamics, while inertial GFM-VSC systems may exhibit loss of synchronization (LOS), characterized by the divergence of the output angle in the active power control loop. These behaviours are different from conventional synchronous generator (SG)-based systems, where power swings are typically characterized by physical angle deviations among power sources. Based on these findings, this paper explores the performance of traditional impedance-based swing detection schemes in GFM-VSC systems. The theoretical analysis is validated through various simulations using the PSCAD/EMTDC platform, covering both single and multi-machine system scenarios.

Title: Properties of Near Field Focusing for Cylindrical Dipole Arrays in Enclosed Array Volume
Authors: Jiawang Li
Abstract: Motivated by large intelligent surface applications, the electric field properties of near field focusing using phase conjugation method are analyzed for cylindrical dipole arrays. Firstly, for the transmitting antennas featuring vertical polarization, the polarization characteristic is decomposed along the x, y, and z directions. Three typical cases are studied when the focal points are at (xf , 0, 0), (0, yf , 0), and (0, 0, zf ). When the length of the cylindrical dipole array is significantly larger compared to its radius, certain unique insights emerge. When the focal point is positioned along (0, 0, zf ), apart from the region on both sides, the ratio between Ez and Ex/Ey remains {\pi}/2. Additionally, When the focal point is located within the cylinder, the electric field of each polarization is approximately the same everywhere. In other words, beam focusing does not incur losses due to different positions. The focusing resolution of Ez is the same in the transverse and longitudinal directions. Different from the situation where the 3 - dB focal beam depth is much smaller than the focal beam width for the most of arrays, the resolution in the longitudinal can be improved, respectively. Through a comprehensive grasp of these design principles, we can gain a deeper understanding of the specific areas with significant potential for practical applications.

Title: TextDiffSeg: Text-guided Latent Diffusion Model for 3d Medical Images Segmentation
Authors: Kangbo Ma
Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have demonstrated significant potential in 3D medical image segmentation tasks. However, their high computational cost and inability to fully capture global 3D contextual information limit their practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose a novel text-guided diffusion model framework, TextDiffSeg. This method leverages a conditional diffusion framework that integrates 3D volumetric data with natural language descriptions, enabling cross-modal embedding and establishing a shared semantic space between visual and textual modalities. By enhancing the model's ability to recognize complex anatomical structures, TextDiffSeg incorporates innovative label embedding techniques and cross-modal attention mechanisms, effectively reducing computational complexity while preserving global 3D contextual integrity. Experimental results demonstrate that TextDiffSeg consistently outperforms existing methods in segmentation tasks involving kidney and pancreas tumors, as well as multi-organ segmentation scenarios. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of key components, highlighting the synergistic interaction between text fusion, image feature extractor, and label encoder. TextDiffSeg provides an efficient and accurate solution for 3D medical image segmentation, showcasing its broad applicability in clinical diagnosis and treatment planning.

Title: Scalable Multi-task Edge Sensing via Task-oriented Joint Information Gathering and Broadcast
Authors: Huawei Hou, Suzhi Bi, Xian Li, Shuoyao Wang, Liping Qian, Zhi Quan
Abstract: The recent advance of edge computing technology enables significant sensing performance improvement of Internet of Things (IoT) networks. In particular, an edge server (ES) is responsible for gathering sensing data from distributed sensing devices, and immediately executing different sensing tasks to accommodate the heterogeneous service demands of mobile users. However, as the number of users surges and the sensing tasks become increasingly compute-intensive, the huge amount of computation workloads and data transmissions may overwhelm the edge system of limited resources. Accordingly, we propose in this paper a scalable edge sensing framework for multi-task execution, in the sense that the computation workload and communication overhead of the ES do not increase with the number of downstream users or tasks. By exploiting the task-relevant correlations, the proposed scheme implements a unified encoder at the ES, which produces a common low-dimensional message from the sensing data and broadcasts it to all users to execute their individual tasks. To achieve high sensing accuracy, we extend the well-known information bottleneck theory to a multi-task scenario to jointly optimize the information gathering and broadcast processes. We also develop an efficient two-step training procedure to optimize the parameters of the neural network-based codecs deployed in the edge sensing system. Experiment results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the considered representative benchmark methods in multi-task inference accuracy. Besides, the proposed scheme is scalable to the network size, which maintains almost constant computation delay with less than 1% degradation of inference performance when the user number increases by four times.

Title: Channel-Adaptive Robust Resource Allocation for Highly Reliable IRS-Assisted V2X Communications
Authors: Peng Wang, Weihua Wu
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of resource allocation in vehicular networks enhanced by Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS), considering the uncertain Channel State Information (CSI) typical of vehicular environments due to the Doppler shift. Leveraging the 3GPP's Mode 1 cellular V2X architecture, our system model facilitates efficient subcarrier usage and interference reduction through coordinated V2I and V2V communications. Each Cellular User Equipment (CUE) shares its spectrum with at most one Vehicular User Equipment (VUE) in a one-to-one reuse pattern. We formulate a joint optimization problem for vehicular transmit power, Multi-User Detection (MUD) matrices, V2V link spectrum reuse, and IRS reflection coefficients in IRS-aided V2X communication with imperfect CSI. To tackle this, a novel robust resource allocation algorithm is developed by first decomposing the problem into manageable sub-problems such as power allocation, MUD matrices optimization and IRS phase shifts, and then using the Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) method to alternately optimize these subproblems for optimal resource allocation. Our contributions include efficient approaches for self-learning based power allocation and phase shift optimization that adapt to CSI uncertainties, significantly enhancing the reliability and efficiency of vehicular communications. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions in improving the Quality of Service (QoS) and managing the complex interference inherent in dense vehicular networks.

Title: A Novel Approach to Secure RSMA Networks
Authors: Shaima Abidrabbu, Hüseyin Arslan
Abstract: This letter introduces a novel data-dependent interleaving technique designed to enhance the security of rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) networks by protecting the common stream from eavesdropping threats. Specifically, we exploit the RSMA structure by interleaving the common bits of each user based on a sequence derived from their private bits. By decoding its private stream, the legitimate receiver reconstructs the interleaving sequence set by the transmitter and successfully de-interleaves the common stream. Therefore, the common part is successfully prevented from being intercepted by an eavesdropper who is unable to deduce the dynamic changing interleaving permutations. To ensure dynamic interleaving sequences, a private bit selection approach that balances the trade-off between security and system efficiency is proposed. Simulation findings confirm the effectiveness of the suggested method, showing notable security improvements while maintaining robust overall system reliability.

Title: A Novel Splitter Design for RSMA Networks
Authors: Sawaira Rafaqat Ali, Shaima Abidrabbu, H. M. Furqan, Hüseyin Arslan
Abstract: Rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) has firmly established itself as a powerful methodology for multiple access, interference management, and multi-user strategy for next-generation communication systems. In this paper, we propose a novel channel-dependent splitter design for multi-carrier RSMA systems, aimed at improving reliability performance. Specifically, the proposed splitter leverages channel state information and the inherent structure of RSMA to intelligently replicate segments of the private stream data that are likely to encounter deep-faded subchannels into the common stream. Thus, the reliability is enhanced within the same transmission slot, minimizing the need for frequent retransmissions and thereby reducing latency. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct comprehensive evaluations using key performance metrics, including achievable sum rate, average packet delay, and bit error rate (BER), under both perfect and imperfect channel estimation scenarios.

Our solution is evaluated through both simulations and real-world experiments, showing a potential throughput improvement of up to 5x compared to standard LoRa. This advancement positions Super-LoRa as a viable solution for data-intensive IoT applications such as smart cities and precision agriculture, which demand higher data transmission rates.

Title: Novel-view X-ray Projection Synthesis through Geometry-Integrated Deep Learning
Authors: Daiqi Liu, Fuxin Fan, Andreas Maier
Abstract: X-ray imaging plays a crucial role in the medical field, providing essential insights into the internal anatomy of patients for diagnostics, image-guided procedures, and clinical decision-making. Traditional techniques often require multiple X-ray projections from various angles to obtain a comprehensive view, leading to increased radiation exposure and more complex clinical processes. This paper explores an innovative approach using the DL-GIPS model, which synthesizes X-ray projections from new viewpoints by leveraging a single existing projection. The model strategically manipulates geometry and texture features extracted from an initial projection to match new viewing angles. It then synthesizes the final projection by merging these modified geometry features with consistent texture information through an advanced image generation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness and broad applicability of the DL-GIPS framework through lung imaging examples, highlighting its potential to revolutionize stereoscopic and volumetric imaging by minimizing the need for extensive data acquisition.

Title: A Koopman Operator Approach to Data-Driven Control of Semilinear Parabolic Systems
Authors: Joachim Deutscher, Tarik Enderes
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the data-driven stabilization of unknown boundary controlled semilinear parabolic systems. The nonlinear dynamics of the system are lifted using a finite number of eigenfunctionals of the Koopman operator related to the autonomous semilinear PDE. This results in a novel data-driven finite-dimensional model of the lifted dynamics, which is amenable to apply design procedures for finite-dimensional systems to stabilize the semilinear parabolic system. In order to facilitate this, a bilinearization of the lifted dynamics is considered and feedback linearization is applied for the data-driven stabilization of the semilinear parabolic PDE. This reveals a novel connection between the assignment of eigenfunctionals to the closed-loop Koopman operator and feedback linearization. By making use of a modal representation, exponential stability of the closed-loop system in the presence of errors resulting from the data-driven computation of eigenfunctionals and the bilinearization is verified. The data-driven controller directly follows from applying generalized eDMD to state data available for the semilinear parabolic PDE. An example of an unstable semilinear reaction-diffusion system with finite-time blow up demonstrates the novel data-driven stabilization approach.

Title: Power Line Communication vs. Talkative Power Conversion: A Benchmarking Study
Authors: Peter A. Hoeher, Yang Leng, Maximilian Mewis, Rongwu Zhu
Abstract: The convergence of energy transmission and data communication has become a key feature of decentralized energy systems across a broad spectrum of voltage/power ranges, including smart grid applications and cyber-physical power systems. This paper compares two distinct approaches: Power Line Communications (PLC) and Talkative Power Conversion (TPC). While PLC leverages existing power infrastructure for data transmission by using external data transmitters and receivers, TPC integrates communication capabilities directly into power electronic converters. We present their technical foundations and applications, benchmark their strengths and bottlenecks, and outline future research directions regarding TPC that could bridge the gap between power and communication technologies.

Title: Contract-based hierarchical control using predictive feasibility value functions
Authors: Felix Berkel, Kim Peter Wabersich, Hongxi Xiang, Elias Milios
Abstract: Today's control systems are often characterized by modularity and safety requirements to handle complexity, resulting in hierarchical control structures. Although hierarchical model predictive control offers favorable properties, achieving a provably safe, yet modular design remains a challenge. This paper introduces a contract-based hierarchical control strategy to improve the performance of control systems facing challenges related to model inconsistency and independent controller design across hierarchies. We consider a setup where a higher-level controller generates references that affect the constraints of a lower-level controller, which is based on a soft-constrained MPC formulation. The optimal slack variables serve as the basis for a contract that allows the higher-level controller to assess the feasibility of the reference trajectory without exact knowledge of the model, constraints, and cost of the lower-level controller. To ensure computational efficiency while maintaining model confidentiality, we propose using an explicit function approximation, such as a neural network, to represent the cost of optimal slack values. The approach is tested for a hierarchical control setup consisting of a planner and a motion controller as commonly found in autonomous driving.

Title: The CAM Model: An in vivo Testbed for Molecular Communication Systems
Authors: Fardad Vakilipoor, Andreas Ettner-Sitter, Lucas Brand, Sebastian Lotter, Thiha Aung, Silke Harteis, Robert Schober, Maximilian Schäfer
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) research increasingly focuses on biomedical applications like health monitoring and drug delivery, demanding testing in realistic living environments. Elevating MC research requires developing advanced in vivo testbeds. We introduce the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model as the first versatile 3D in vivo MC platform. The CAM, a highly vascularized membrane in fertilized chicken eggs, is established in bioengineering, cancer research, and drug development. Its biological realism, reproducibility, and versatility make it ideal for next-generation MC testbeds, bridging proof-of-concept systems and practical applications. We comprehensively characterize the CAM model's properties and MC system relevance. Through experimental studies, we investigate fluorescent molecule distribution in the CAM's closed-loop vascular system. We derive an analytical model using the wrapped normal distribution to describe particle propagation in dispersive closed-loop systems dominated by diffusion and flow. Parametric models are developed to approximate particle dynamics in the CAM, with parameters estimated via nonlinear least squares curve fitting. A dataset of 69 regions from 25 eggs validates our models. We analyze parameter relationships and biological plausibility. Finally, we develop a parametric model for long-term particle behavior and liver accumulation in chick embryos.

Abstract: Deep generative models have been studied and developed primarily in the context of natural images and computer vision. This has spurred the development of (Bayesian) methods that use these generative models for inverse problems in image restoration, such as denoising, inpainting, and super-resolution. In recent years, generative modeling for Bayesian inference on sensory data has also gained traction. Nevertheless, the direct application of generative modeling techniques initially designed for natural images on raw sensory data is not straightforward, requiring solutions that deal with high dynamic range signals acquired from multiple sensors or arrays of sensors that interfere with each other, and that typically acquire data at a very high rate. Moreover, the exact physical data-generating process is often complex or unknown. As a consequence, approximate models are used, resulting in discrepancies between model predictions and the observations that are non-Gaussian, in turn complicating the Bayesian inverse problem. Finally, sensor data is often used in real-time processing or decision-making systems, imposing stringent requirements on, e.g., latency and throughput. In this paper, we will discuss some of these challenges and offer approaches to address them, all in the context of high-rate real-time sensing applications in automotive radar and medical imaging.

Title: Discrete-Time Modeling of Interturn Short Circuits in Interior PMSMs
Authors: Lukas Zezula, Matus Kozovsky, Ludek Buchta, Petr Blaha
Abstract: This article describes the discrete-time modeling approach for interturn short circuits in interior permanent magnet synchronous motors with concentrated windings that facilitate model-based fault diagnostics and mitigation. A continuous-time model incorporating universal series-parallel stator winding connection and radial permanent magnet fluxes is developed in the stator variables and transformed into the rotor reference frame, including also the electromagnetic torque. The transformed model undergoes discretization using the matrix exponential-based technique, wherein the electrical angular velocity and angle are considered time-varying parameters. The resulting model is subsequently expanded to consider the motor connection resistance via perturbation techniques. In the laboratory experiments, we validate the dynamical properties of the derived model by comparing its outputs with the experimental data and waveforms generated by the forward Euler-based discrete-time approximation.

Title: Modality-Independent Explainable Detection of Inaccurate Organ Segmentations Using Denoising Autoencoders
Authors: Levente Lippenszky, István Megyeri, Krisztian Koos, Zsófia Karancsi, Borbála Deák-Karancsi, András Frontó, Árpád Makk, Attila Rádics, Erhan Bas, László Ruskó
Abstract: In radiation therapy planning, inaccurate segmentations of organs at risk can result in suboptimal treatment delivery, if left undetected by the clinician. To address this challenge, we developed a denoising autoencoder-based method to detect inaccurate organ segmentations. We applied noise to ground truth organ segmentations, and the autoencoders were tasked to denoise them. Through the application of our method to organ segmentations generated on both MR and CT scans, we demonstrated that the method is independent of imaging modality. By providing reconstructions, our method offers visual information about inaccurate regions of the organ segmentations, leading to more explainable detection of suboptimal segmentations. We compared our method to existing approaches in the literature and demonstrated that it achieved superior performance for the majority of organs.

The design is based on the formalism of Control Barrier Functions and represents an anti-windup integrator modification for position-limited servo-controllers. The method is applicable to Linear Time Invariant Multi-Input-Multi-Output open-loop stable continuous time systems. A flight control application example of the developed anti-windup control solution is discussed.

Title: Servo-Controllers with Operational Constraints
Authors: Eugene Lavretsky
Abstract: In this paper, a proportional-integral servo-control design method is developed for multi-input-multioutput linear time invariant systems with operational constraints imposed on the system control input and on an output of the same dimension as the control input. The design is based on min-norm controllers and Control Barrier Functions. It allows to enforce min/max box constraints by analytically solving Quadratic Programs for min-norm augmentation controllers. The method provides an anti-windup protection for the controller integrator state and enforces the desired operational control and output constraints, component-wise. A simulation example is given to illustrate potential benefits of the proposed design methodology for aerial flight critical systems.

Title: Interacting Object-Enabled Clustering and Characterization of Distributed MIMO Channels
Authors: Yingjie Xu, Michiel Sandra, Xuesong Cai, Sara Willhammar, Fredrik Tufvesson
Abstract: Distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), also known as cell-free massive MIMO, emerges as a promising technology for sixth-generation (6G) systems to support uniform coverage and reliable communication. For the design and optimization of such systems, measurement-based investigations of real-world distributed MIMO channels are essential. In this paper, we present an indoor channel measurement campaign, featuring eight distributed antenna arrays with 128 elements in total. Multi-link channels are measured at 50 positions along a 12-meter user route. A clustering algorithm enabled by interacting objects is proposed to identify clusters in the measured channels. The algorithm jointly clusters the multipath components for all links, effectively capturing the dynamic contributions of common clusters to different links. In addition, a Kalman filter-based tracking framework is introduced for cluster prediction, tracking, and updating along the user movement. Using the clustering and tracking results, cluster-level characterization of the measured channels is performed. First, the number of clusters and their visibility at both link ends are analyzed. Next, a maximum-likelihood estimator is utilized to determine the entire cluster visibility region length. Finally, key cluster-level properties, including the common cluster ratio, cluster power, shadowing, spread, among others, are statistically investigated. The results provide valuable insights into cluster behavior in typical multi-link channels, necessary for accurate modeling of distributed MIMO channels.

Abstract: Distributed multiple-input multiple-output (D\mbox{-}MIMO) is a promising technology to realize the promise of massive MIMO gains by fiber-connecting the distributed antenna arrays, thereby overcoming the form factor limitations of co-located MIMO. In this paper, we introduce the concept of mobile D-MIMO (MD-MIMO) network, a further extension of the D-MIMO technology where distributed antenna arrays are connected to the base station with a wireless link allowing all radio network nodes to be mobile. This approach significantly improves deployment flexibility and reduces operating costs, enabling the network to adapt to the highly dynamic nature of next-generation (NextG) networks. We discuss use cases, system design, network architecture, and the key enabling technologies for MD-MIMO. Furthermore, we investigate a case study of MD-MIMO for vehicular networks, presenting detailed performance evaluations for both downlink and uplink. The results show that an MD-MIMO network can provide substantial improvements in network throughput and reliability.

Title: Comparative Evaluation of Radiomics and Deep Learning Models for Disease Detection in Chest Radiography
Authors: Zhijin He, Alan B. McMillan
Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging has revolutionized diagnostic practices, enabling advanced analysis and interpretation of radiological data. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of radiomics-based and deep learning-based approaches for disease detection in chest radiography, focusing on COVID-19, lung opacity, and viral pneumonia. While deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), learn directly from image data, radiomics-based models extract and analyze quantitative features, potentially providing advantages in data-limited scenarios. This study systematically compares the diagnostic accuracy and robustness of various AI models, including Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) for radiomics, against state-of-the-art computer vision deep learning architectures. Performance metrics across varying sample sizes reveal insights into each model's efficacy, highlighting the contexts in which specific AI approaches may offer enhanced diagnostic capabilities. The results aim to inform the integration of AI-driven diagnostic tools in clinical practice, particularly in automated and high-throughput environments where timely, reliable diagnosis is critical. This comparative study addresses an essential gap, establishing guidance for the selection of AI models based on clinical and operational needs.

Title: Experimental Analysis of Multipath Characteristics in Indoor Distributed Massive MIMO Channels
Authors: Yingjie Xu, Xuesong Cai, Sara Willhammar, Fredrik Tufvesson
Abstract: Distributed massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), also known as cell-free massive MIMO, has emerged as a promising technology for sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. This letter introduces an indoor channel measurement campaign designed to explore the behavior of multipath components (MPCs) in distributed massive MIMO channels. Fully coherent channels were measured between eight distributed uniform planar arrays (128 elements in total) and a 12-meter user equipment route. Furthermore, a method is introduced to determine the order (single- or multi-bounce) of MPC interaction by leveraging map information and MPC parameters. In addition, a Kalman filter-based framework is used for identifying the MPC interaction mechanisms (reflection or scattering/diffraction/mixed). Finally, a comprehensive MPC-level characterization is performed based on the measured channels, including the significance of the single-bounce MPCs, the spherical wavefront features, the birth-and-death processes of the MPCs, and the spatial distribution of reflections. The findings serve as a valuable reference for understanding MPC propagation behavior, which is necessary for accurate modeling of indoor distributed massive MIMO channels.

Title: Correlation Ratio for Unsupervised Learning of Multi-modal Deformable Registration
Authors: Xiaojian Chen, Yihao Liu, Shuwen Wei, Aaron Carass, Yong Du, Junyu Chen
Abstract: In recent years, unsupervised learning for deformable image registration has been a major research focus. This approach involves training a registration network using pairs of moving and fixed images, along with a loss function that combines an image similarity measure and deformation regularization. For multi-modal image registration tasks, the correlation ratio has been a widely-used image similarity measure historically, yet it has been underexplored in current deep learning methods. Here, we propose a differentiable correlation ratio to use as a loss function for learning-based multi-modal deformable image registration. This approach extends the traditionally non-differentiable implementation of the correlation ratio by using the Parzen windowing approximation, enabling backpropagation with deep neural networks. We validated the proposed correlation ratio on a multi-modal neuroimaging dataset. In addition, we established a Bayesian training framework to study how the trade-off between the deformation regularizer and similarity measures, including mutual information and our proposed correlation ratio, affects the registration performance.

Title: SEROAISE: Advancing ROA Estimation for ReLU and PWA Dynamics through Estimating Certified Invariant Sets
Authors: Pouya Samanipour, Hasan Poonawala
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for constructing the Region of Attraction (RoA) for dynamics derived either from Piecewise Affine (PWA) functions or from Neural Networks (NNs) with Rectified Linear Units (ReLU) activation function. This method, described as Sequential Estimation of RoA based on Invariant Set Estimation (SEROAISE), computes a Lyapunov-like PWA function over a certified PWA invariant set. While traditional approaches search for Lyapunov functions by enforcing Lyapunov conditions over pre-selected domains, this framework enforces Lyapunov-like conditions over a certified invariant subset obtained using the Iterative Invariant Set Estimator(IISE). Compared to the state-of-the-art, IISE provides systematically larger certified invariant sets. In order to find a larger invariant subset, the IISE utilizes a novel concept known as the Non-Uniform Growth of Invariant Set (NUGIS). A number of examples illustrating the efficacy of the proposed methods are provided, including dynamical systems derived from learning algorithms. The implementation is publicly available at: this https URL.

Title: MultiCore+TPU Accelerated Multi-Modal TinyML for Livestock Behaviour Recognition
Authors: Qianxue Zhang, Eiman Kanjo
Abstract: The advancement of technology has revolutionised the agricultural industry, transitioning it from labour-intensive farming practices to automated, AI-powered management systems. In recent years, more intelligent livestock monitoring solutions have been proposed to enhance farming efficiency and productivity. This work presents a novel approach to animal activity recognition and movement tracking, leveraging tiny machine learning (TinyML) techniques, wireless communication framework, and microcontroller platforms to develop an efficient, cost-effective livestock sensing system. It collects and fuses accelerometer data and vision inputs to build a multi-modal network for three tasks: image classification, object detection, and behaviour recognition. The system is deployed and evaluated on commercial microcontrollers for real-time inference using embedded applications, demonstrating up to 270$\times$ model size reduction, less than 80ms response latency, and on-par performance comparable to existing methods. The incorporation of the TinyML technique allows for seamless data transmission between devices, benefiting use cases in remote locations with poor Internet connectivity. This work delivers a robust, scalable IoT-edge livestock monitoring solution adaptable to diverse farming needs, offering flexibility for future extensions.

Title: High Dynamic Range Modulo Imaging for Robust Object Detection in Autonomous Driving
Authors: Kebin Contreras, Brayan Monroy, Jorge Bacca
Abstract: Object detection precision is crucial for ensuring the safety and efficacy of autonomous driving systems. The quality of acquired images directly influences the ability of autonomous driving systems to correctly recognize and respond to other vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles in real-time. However, real environments present extreme variations in lighting, causing saturation problems and resulting in the loss of crucial details for detection. Traditionally, High Dynamic Range (HDR) images have been preferred for their ability to capture a broad spectrum of light intensities, but the need for multiple captures to construct HDR images is inefficient for real-time applications in autonomous vehicles. To address these issues, this work introduces the use of modulo sensors for robust object detection. The modulo sensor allows pixels to `reset/wrap' upon reaching saturation level by acquiring an irradiance encoding image which can then be recovered using unwrapping algorithms. The applied reconstruction techniques enable HDR recovery of color intensity and image details, ensuring better visual quality even under extreme lighting conditions at the cost of extra time. Experiments with the YOLOv10 model demonstrate that images processed using modulo images achieve performance comparable to HDR images and significantly surpass saturated images in terms of object detection accuracy. Moreover, the proposed modulo imaging step combined with HDR image reconstruction is shorter than the time required for conventional HDR image acquisition.

Title: snnTrans-DHZ: A Lightweight Spiking Neural Network Architecture for Underwater Image Dehazing
Authors: Vidya Sudevan, Fakhreddine Zayer, Rizwana Kausar, Sajid Javed, Hamad Karki, Giulia De Masi, Jorge Dias
Abstract: Underwater image dehazing is critical for vision-based marine operations because light scattering and absorption can severely reduce visibility. This paper introduces snnTrans-DHZ, a lightweight Spiking Neural Network (SNN) specifically designed for underwater dehazing. By leveraging the temporal dynamics of SNNs, snnTrans-DHZ efficiently processes time-dependent raw image sequences while maintaining low power consumption. Static underwater images are first converted into time-dependent sequences by repeatedly inputting the same image over user-defined timesteps. These RGB sequences are then transformed into LAB color space representations and processed concurrently. The architecture features three key modules: (i) a K estimator that extracts features from multiple color space representations; (ii) a Background Light Estimator that jointly infers the background light component from the RGB-LAB images; and (iii) a soft image reconstruction module that produces haze-free, visibility-enhanced outputs. The snnTrans-DHZ model is directly trained using a surrogate gradient-based backpropagation through time (BPTT) strategy alongside a novel combined loss function. Evaluated on the UIEB benchmark, snnTrans-DHZ achieves a PSNR of 21.68 dB and an SSIM of 0.8795, and on the EUVP dataset, it yields a PSNR of 23.46 dB and an SSIM of 0.8439. With only 0.5670 million network parameters, and requiring just 7.42 GSOPs and 0.0151 J of energy, the algorithm significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency. These features make snnTrans-DHZ highly suitable for deployment in underwater robotics, marine exploration, and environmental monitoring.

Title: Probabilistic Task Parameterization of Tool-Tissue Interaction via Sparse Landmarks Tracking in Robotic Surgery
Authors: Yiting Wang, Yunxin Fan, Fei Liu
Abstract: Accurate modeling of tool-tissue interactions in robotic surgery requires precise tracking of deformable tissues and integration of surgical domain knowledge. Traditional methods rely on labor-intensive annotations or rigid assumptions, limiting flexibility. We propose a framework combining sparse keypoint tracking and probabilistic modeling that propagates expert-annotated landmarks across endoscopic frames, even with large tissue deformations. Clustered tissue keypoints enable dynamic local transformation construction via PCA, and tool poses, tracked similarly, are expressed relative to these frames. Embedding these into a Task-Parameterized Gaussian Mixture Model (TP-GMM) integrates data-driven observations with labeled clinical expertise, effectively predicting relative tool-tissue poses and enhancing visual understanding of robotic surgical motions directly from video data.

Title: TransitReID: Transit OD Data Collection with Occlusion-Resistant Dynamic Passenger Re-Identification
Authors: Kaicong Huang, Talha Azfar, Jack Reilly, Ruimin Ke
Abstract: Transit Origin-Destination (OD) data are essential for transit planning, particularly in route optimization and demand-responsive paratransit systems. Traditional methods, such as manual surveys, are costly and inefficient, while Bluetooth and WiFi-based approaches require passengers to carry specific devices, limiting data coverage. On the other hand, most transit vehicles are equipped with onboard cameras for surveillance, offering an opportunity to repurpose them for edge-based OD data collection through visual person re-identification (ReID). However, such approaches face significant challenges, including severe occlusion and viewpoint variations in transit environments, which greatly reduce matching accuracy and hinder their adoption. Moreover, designing effective algorithms that can operate efficiently on edge devices remains an open challenge. To address these challenges, we propose TransitReID, a novel framework for individual-level transit OD data collection. TransitReID consists of two key components: (1) An occlusion-robust ReID algorithm featuring a variational autoencoder guided region-attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on visible body regions through reconstruction loss-optimized weight allocation; and (2) a Hierarchical Storage and Dynamic Matching (HSDM) mechanism specifically designed for efficient and robust transit OD matching which balances storage, speed, and accuracy. Additionally, a multi-threaded design supports near real-time operation on edge devices, which also ensuring privacy protection. We also introduce a ReID dataset tailored for complex bus environments to address the lack of relevant training data. Experimental results demonstrate that TransitReID achieves state-of-the-art performance in ReID tasks, with an accuracy of approximately 90\% in bus route simulations.

Title: ConvShareViT: Enhancing Vision Transformers with Convolutional Attention Mechanisms for Free-Space Optical Accelerators
Authors: Riad Ibadulla, Thomas M. Chen, Constantino Carlos Reyes-Aldasoro
Abstract: This paper introduces ConvShareViT, a novel deep learning architecture that adapts Vision Transformers (ViTs) to the 4f free-space optical system. ConvShareViT replaces linear layers in multi-head self-attention (MHSA) and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) with a depthwise convolutional layer with shared weights across input channels. Through the development of ConvShareViT, the behaviour of convolutions within MHSA and their effectiveness in learning the attention mechanism were analysed systematically. Experimental results demonstrate that certain configurations, particularly those using valid-padded shared convolutions, can successfully learn attention, achieving comparable attention scores to those obtained with standard ViTs. However, other configurations, such as those using same-padded convolutions, show limitations in attention learning and operate like regular CNNs rather than transformer models. ConvShareViT architectures are specifically optimised for the 4f optical system, which takes advantage of the parallelism and high-resolution capabilities of optical systems. Results demonstrate that ConvShareViT can theoretically achieve up to 3.04 times faster inference than GPU-based systems. This potential acceleration makes ConvShareViT an attractive candidate for future optical deep learning applications and proves that our ViT (ConvShareViT) can be employed using only the convolution operation, via the necessary optimisation of the ViT to balance performance and complexity.

Title: Sub-optimality of the Separation Principle for Quadratic Control from Bilinear Observations
Authors: Yahya Sattar, Sunmook Choi, Yassir Jedra, Maryam Fazel, Sarah Dean
Abstract: We consider the problem of controlling a linear dynamical system from bilinear observations with minimal quadratic cost. Despite the similarity of this problem to standard linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control, we show that when the observation model is bilinear, neither does the Separation Principle hold, nor is the optimal controller affine in the estimated state. Moreover, the cost-to-go is non-convex in the control input. Hence, finding an analytical expression for the optimal feedback controller is difficult in general. Under certain settings, we show that the standard LQG controller locally maximizes the cost instead of minimizing it. Furthermore, the optimal controllers (derived analytically) are not unique and are nonlinear in the estimated state. We also introduce a notion of input-dependent observability and derive conditions under which the Kalman filter covariance remains bounded. We illustrate our theoretical results through numerical experiments in multiple synthetic settings.

Title: Beam Misalignment in 3GPP mmWave NR
Authors: Noe Bernadas i Busquets, Xavier Gelabert, Bleron Klaiqi, Ki Won Sung, Slimane Ben Slimane
Abstract: This paper presents an analytical framework for evaluating beam misalignment in 3GPP mmWave NR systems implementing analog beamforming. Our approach captures the interaction between user mobility, beam sweeping mechanisms, and deployment configurations, focusing on long-term average performance metrics. Specifically, we model the beam misalignment rates at both the base station (BS) and user equipment (UE) as Poisson processes and derive expressions for the expected misalignment duration, misalignment fraction, and overall beamforming gain. The framework accounts for practical constraints in NR such as Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSB) periodicity, TDD frame structures, and SSB overhead. Through numerical evaluation based on 3GPP mmWave parameters, we identify key trade-offs between beam counts, user mobility, and SSB timing, providing actionable design insights for robust and efficient beam management in future high-frequency networks.

Title: Towards a Universal Vibration Analysis Dataset: A Framework for Transfer Learning in Predictive Maintenance and Structural Health Monitoring
Authors: Mert Sehri, Igor Varejão, Zehui Hua, Vitor Bonella, Adriano Santos, Francisco de Assis Boldt, Patrick Dumond, Flavio Miguel Varejão
Abstract: ImageNet has become a reputable resource for transfer learning, allowing the development of efficient ML models with reduced training time and data requirements. However, vibration analysis in predictive maintenance, structural health monitoring, and fault diagnosis, lacks a comparable large-scale, annotated dataset to facilitate similar advancements. To address this, a dataset framework is proposed that begins with bearing vibration data as an initial step towards creating a universal dataset for vibration-based spectrogram analysis for all machinery. The initial framework includes a collection of bearing vibration signals from various publicly available datasets. To demonstrate the advantages of this framework, experiments were conducted using a deep learning architecture, showing improvements in model performance when pre-trained on bearing vibration data and fine-tuned on a smaller, domain-specific dataset. These findings highlight the potential to parallel the success of ImageNet in visual computing but for vibration analysis. For future work, this research will include a broader range of vibration signals from multiple types of machinery, emphasizing spectrogram-based representations of the data. Each sample will be labeled according to machinery type, operational status, and the presence or type of faults, ensuring its utility for supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. Additionally, a framework for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training specific to vibration data will be developed. This framework will standardize methodologies across the research community, allowing for collaboration and accelerating progress in predictive maintenance, structural health monitoring, and related fields. By mirroring the success of ImageNet in visual computing, this dataset has the potential to improve the development of intelligent systems in industrial applications.

Title: Making Acoustic Side-Channel Attacks on Noisy Keyboards Viable with LLM-Assisted Spectrograms' "Typo" Correction
Authors: Seyyed Ali Ayati, Jin Hyun Park, Yichen Cai, Marcus Botacin
Abstract: The large integration of microphones into devices increases the opportunities for Acoustic Side-Channel Attacks (ASCAs), as these can be used to capture keystrokes' audio signals that might reveal sensitive information. However, the current State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) models for ASCAs, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and hybrid models, such as CoAtNet, still exhibit limited robustness under realistic noisy conditions. Solving this problem requires either: (i) an increased model's capacity to infer contextual information from longer sequences, allowing the model to learn that an initially noisily typed word is the same as a futurely collected non-noisy word, or (ii) an approach to fix misidentified information from the contexts, as one does not type random words, but the ones that best fit the conversation context. In this paper, we demonstrate that both strategies are viable and complementary solutions for making ASCAs practical. We observed that no existing solution leverages advanced transformer architectures' power for these tasks and propose that: (i) Visual Transformers (VTs) are the candidate solutions for capturing long-term contextual information and (ii) transformer-powered Large Language Models (LLMs) are the candidate solutions to fix the ``typos'' (mispredictions) the model might make. Thus, we here present the first-of-its-kind approach that integrates VTs and LLMs for ASCAs. We first show that VTs achieve SOTA performance in classifying keystrokes when compared to the previous CNN benchmark. Second, we demonstrate that LLMs can mitigate the impact of real-world noise. Evaluations on the natural sentences revealed that: (i) incorporating LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) in our ASCA pipeline boosts the performance of error-correction tasks; and (ii) the comparable performance can be attained by a lightweight, fine-tuned smaller LLM (67 times smaller than GPT-4o), using...

Title: Achieving Tighter Finite-Time Rates for Heterogeneous Federated Stochastic Approximation under Markovian Sampling
Authors: Feng Zhu, Aritra Mitra, Robert W. Heath
Abstract: Motivated by collaborative reinforcement learning (RL) and optimization with time-correlated data, we study a generic federated stochastic approximation problem involving $M$ agents, where each agent is characterized by an agent-specific (potentially nonlinear) local operator. The goal is for the agents to communicate intermittently via a server to find the root of the average of the agents' local operators. The generality of our setting stems from allowing for (i) Markovian data at each agent and (ii) heterogeneity in the roots of the agents' local operators. The limited recent work that has accounted for both these features in a federated setting fails to guarantee convergence to the desired point or to show any benefit of collaboration; furthermore, they rely on projection steps in their algorithms to guarantee bounded iterates. Our work overcomes each of these limitations. We develop a novel algorithm titled \texttt{FedHSA}, and prove that it guarantees convergence to the correct point, while enjoying an $M$-fold linear speedup in sample-complexity due to collaboration. To our knowledge, \emph{this is the first finite-time result of its kind}, and establishing it (without relying on a projection step) entails a fairly intricate argument that accounts for the interplay between complex temporal correlations due to Markovian sampling, multiple local steps to save communication, and the drift-effects induced by heterogeneous local operators. Our results have implications for a broad class of heterogeneous federated RL problems (e.g., policy evaluation and control) with function approximation, where the agents' Markov decision processes can differ in their probability transition kernels and reward functions.

Title: Linearity, Time Invariance, and Passivity of a Novice Person in Human Teleoperation
Authors: David Black, Septimiu Salcudean
Abstract: Low-cost teleguidance of medical procedures is becoming essential to provide healthcare to remote and underserved communities. Human teleoperation is a promising new method for guiding a novice person with relatively high precision and efficiency through a mixed reality (MR) interface. Prior work has shown that the novice, or "follower", can reliably track the MR input with performance not unlike a telerobotic system. As a consequence, it is of interest to understand and control the follower's dynamics to optimize the system performance and permit stable and transparent bilateral teleoperation. To this end, linearity, time-invariance, inter-axis coupling, and passivity are important in teleoperation and controller design. This paper therefore explores these effects with regard to the follower person in human teleoperation. It is demonstrated through modeling and experiments that the follower can indeed be treated as approximately linear and time invariant, with little coupling and a large excess of passivity at practical frequencies. Furthermore, a stochastic model of the follower dynamics is derived. These results will permit controller design and analysis to improve the performance of human teleoperation.

Title: Transformer-Driven Neural Beamforming with Imperfect CSI in Urban Macro Wireless Channels
Authors: Cemil Vahapoglu, Timothy J. O'Shea, Wan Liu, Tamoghna Roy, Sennur Ulukus
Abstract: The literature is abundant with methodologies focusing on using transformer architectures due to their prominence in wireless signal processing and their capability to capture long-range dependencies via attention mechanisms. In particular, depthwise separable convolutions enhance parameter efficiency for the process of high-dimensional data characteristics of MIMO systems. In this work, we introduce a novel unsupervised deep learning framework that integrates depthwise separable convolutions and transformers to generate beamforming weights under imperfect channel state information (CSI) for a multi-user single-input multiple-output (MU-SIMO) system in dense urban environments. The primary goal is to enhance throughput by maximizing sum-rate while ensuring reliable communication. Spectral efficiency and block error rate (BLER) are considered as performance metrics. Experiments are carried out under various conditions to compare the performance of the proposed NNBF framework against baseline methods zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) beamforming. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over the baseline techniques.

Title: Beyond ISAC: Toward Integrated Heterogeneous Service Provisioning via Elastic Multi-Dimensional Multiple Access
Authors: Jie Chen, Xianbin Wang, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: Integrated heterogeneous service provisioning (IHSP) is a promising paradigm that is designed to concurrently support a variety of heterogeneous services, extending beyond sensing and communication to meet the diverse needs of emerging applications. However, a primary challenge of IHSP is addressing the conflicts between multiple competing service demands under constrained resources. In this paper, we overcome this challenge by the joint use of two novel elastic design strategies: compromised service value assessment and flexible multi-dimensional resource multiplexing. Consequently, we propose a value-prioritized elastic multi-dimensional multiple access (MDMA) mechanism for IHSP systems. First, we modify the Value-of-Service (VoS) metric by incorporating elastic parameters to characterize user-specific tolerance and compromise in response to various performance degradations under constrained resources. This VoS metric serves as the foundation for prioritizing services and enabling effective fairness service scheduling among concurrent competing demands. Next, we adapt the MDMA to elastically multiplex services using appropriate multiple access schemes across different resource domains. This protocol leverages user-specific interference tolerances and cancellation capabilities across different domains to reduce resource-demanding conflicts and co-channel interference within the same domain. Then, we maximize the system's VoS by jointly optimizing MDMA design and power allocation. Since this problem is non-convex, we propose a monotonic optimization-assisted dynamic programming (MODP) algorithm to obtain its optimal solution. Additionally, we develop the VoS-prioritized successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm to efficiently find its suboptimal solution. Finally, simulations are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed designs.

Title: A New Paradigm of User-Centric Wireless Communication Driven by Large Language Models
Authors: Kuiyuan Ding, Caili Guo, Yang Yang, Wuxia Hu, Yonina C. Eldar
Abstract: The next generation of wireless communications seeks to deeply integrate artificial intelligence (AI) with user-centric communication networks, with the goal of developing AI-native networks that more accurately address user requirements. The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) offers significant potential in realizing these goals. However, existing efforts that leverage LLMs for wireless communication often overlook the considerable gap between human natural language and the intricacies of real-world communication systems, thus failing to fully exploit the capabilities of LLMs. To address this gap, we propose a novel LLM-driven paradigm for wireless communication that innovatively incorporates the nature language to structured query language (NL2SQL) tool. Specifically, in this paradigm, user personal requirements is the primary focus. Upon receiving a user request, LLMs first analyze the user intent in terms of relevant communication metrics and system parameters. Subsequently, a structured query language (SQL) statement is generated to retrieve the specific parameter values from a high-performance real-time database. We further utilize LLMs to formulate and solve an optimization problem based on the user request and the retrieved parameters. The solution to this optimization problem then drives adjustments in the communication system to fulfill the user's requirements. To validate the feasibility of the proposed paradigm, we present a prototype system. In this prototype, we consider user-request centric semantic communication (URC-SC) system in which a dynamic semantic representation network at the physical layer adapts its encoding depth to meet user requirements. Additionally, two LLMs are employed to analyze user requests and generate SQL statements, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness.

Authors: Donggeon David Oh, Justin Lidard, Haimin Hu, Himani Sinhmar, Elle Lazarski, Deepak Gopinath, Emily S. Sumner, Jonathan A. DeCastro, Guy Rosman, Naomi Ehrich Leonard, Jaime Fernández Fisac
Abstract: We propose a human-centered safety filter (HCSF) for shared autonomy that significantly enhances system safety without compromising human agency. Our HCSF is built on a neural safety value function, which we first learn scalably through black-box interactions and then use at deployment to enforce a novel quality control barrier function (Q-CBF) safety constraint. Since this Q-CBF safety filter does not require any knowledge of the system dynamics for both synthesis and runtime safety monitoring and intervention, our method applies readily to complex, black-box shared autonomy systems. Notably, our HCSF's CBF-based interventions modify the human's actions minimally and smoothly, avoiding the abrupt, last-moment corrections delivered by many conventional safety filters. We validate our approach in a comprehensive in-person user study using Assetto Corsa-a high-fidelity car racing simulator with black-box dynamics-to assess robustness in "driving on the edge" scenarios. We compare both trajectory data and drivers' perceptions of our HCSF assistance against unassisted driving and a conventional safety filter. Experimental results show that 1) compared to having no assistance, our HCSF improves both safety and user satisfaction without compromising human agency or comfort, and 2) relative to a conventional safety filter, our proposed HCSF boosts human agency, comfort, and satisfaction while maintaining robustness.

Title: Virtual VNA 3.1: Non-Coherent-Detection-Based Non-Reciprocal Scattering Matrix Estimation Leveraging a Tunable Load Network
Authors: Philipp del Hougne
Abstract: We refine the recently introduced "Virtual VNA 3.0" technique to remove the need for coherent detection. The resulting "Virtual VNA 3.1" technique can unambiguously estimate the full scattering matrix of a non-reciprocal, linear, passive, time-invariant device under test (DUT) with $N$ monomodal ports using an $N_\mathrm{A}$-channel coherent wavefront generator and an $N_\mathrm{A}$-channel non-coherent detector, where $N_\mathrm{A}<N$. Waves are injected and received only via a fixed set of $N_\mathrm{A}$ "accessible" DUT ports while the remaining $N_\mathrm{S}$ "not-directly-accessible" DUT ports are terminated by a specific tunable load network. To resolve all ambiguities, an additional modified setup is required in which waves are injected and received via a known $2N_\mathrm{A}$-port system connected to the DUT's accessible ports. We experimentally validate our method for $N_\mathrm{A}=N_\mathrm{S}=4$ considering a non-reciprocal eight-port circuit as DUT. By eliminating the need for coherent detection, our work reduces the hardware complexity which may facilitate applications to large-scale or higher-frequency systems. Additionally, our work provides fundamental insights into the minimal requirements to fully and unambiguously characterize a non-reciprocal DUT.

Title: Manifold meta-learning for reduced-complexity neural system identification
Authors: Marco Forgione, Ankush Chakrabarty, Dario Piga, Matteo Rufolo, Alberto Bemporad
Abstract: System identification has greatly benefited from deep learning techniques, particularly for modeling complex, nonlinear dynamical systems with partially unknown physics where traditional approaches may not be feasible. However, deep learning models often require large datasets and significant computational resources at training and inference due to their high-dimensional parameterizations. To address this challenge, we propose a meta-learning framework that discovers a low-dimensional manifold within the parameter space of an over-parameterized neural network architecture. This manifold is learned from a meta-dataset of input-output sequences generated by a class of related dynamical systems, enabling efficient model training while preserving the network's expressive power for the considered system class. Unlike bilevel meta-learning approaches, our method employs an auxiliary neural network to map datasets directly onto the learned manifold, eliminating the need for costly second-order gradient computations during meta-training and reducing the number of first-order updates required in inference, which could be expensive for large models. We validate our approach on a family of Bouc-Wen oscillators, which is a well-studied nonlinear system identification benchmark. We demonstrate that we are able to learn accurate models even in small-data scenarios.

Title: Transferable Deployment of Semantic Edge Inference Systems via Unsupervised Domain Adaption
Authors: Weiqiang Jiao, Suzhi Bi, Xian Li, Cheng Guo, Hao Chen, Zhi Quan
Abstract: This paper investigates deploying semantic edge inference systems for performing a common image clarification task. In particular, each system consists of multiple Internet of Things (IoT) devices that first locally encode the sensing data into semantic features and then transmit them to an edge server for subsequent data fusion and task inference. The inference accuracy is determined by efficient training of the feature encoder/decoder using labeled data samples. Due to the difference in sensing data and communication channel distributions, deploying the system in a new environment may induce high costs in annotating data labels and re-training the encoder/decoder models. To achieve cost-effective transferable system deployment, we propose an efficient Domain Adaptation method for Semantic Edge INference systems (DASEIN) that can maintain high inference accuracy in a new environment without the need for labeled samples. Specifically, DASEIN exploits the task-relevant data correlation between different deployment scenarios by leveraging the techniques of unsupervised domain adaptation and knowledge distillation. It devises an efficient two-step adaptation procedure that sequentially aligns the data distributions and adapts to the channel variations. Numerical results show that, under a substantial change in sensing data distributions, the proposed DASEIN outperforms the best-performing benchmark method by 7.09% and 21.33% in inference accuracy when the new environment has similar or 25 dB lower channel signal to noise power ratios (SNRs), respectively. This verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method in adapting both data and channel distributions in practical transfer deployment applications.

Title: Mind2Matter: Creating 3D Models from EEG Signals
Authors: Xia Deng, Shen Chen, Jiale Zhou, Lei Li
Abstract: The reconstruction of 3D objects from brain signals has gained significant attention in brain-computer interface (BCI) research. Current research predominantly utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for 3D reconstruction tasks due to its excellent spatial resolution. Nevertheless, the clinical utility of fMRI is limited by its prohibitive costs and inability to support real-time operations. In comparison, electroencephalography (EEG) presents distinct advantages as an affordable, non-invasive, and mobile solution for real-time brain-computer interaction systems. While recent advances in deep learning have enabled remarkable progress in image generation from neural data, decoding EEG signals into structured 3D representations remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that translates EEG recordings into 3D object reconstructions by leveraging neural decoding techniques and generative models. Our approach involves training an EEG encoder to extract spatiotemporal visual features, fine-tuning a large language model to interpret these features into descriptive multimodal outputs, and leveraging generative 3D Gaussians with layout-guided control to synthesize the final 3D structures. Experiments demonstrate that our model captures salient geometric and semantic features, paving the way for applications in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), virtual reality, and this http URL code is available in this https URL.

Title: Exploring Video-Based Driver Activity Recognition under Noisy Labels
Authors: Linjuan Fan, Di Wen, Kunyu Peng, Kailun Yang, Jiaming Zhang, Ruiping Liu, Yufan Chen, Junwei Zheng, Jiamin Wu, Xudong Han, Rainer Stiefelhagen
Abstract: As an open research topic in the field of deep learning, learning with noisy labels has attracted much attention and grown rapidly over the past ten years. Learning with label noise is crucial for driver distraction behavior recognition, as real-world video data often contains mislabeled samples, impacting model reliability and performance. However, label noise learning is barely explored in the driver activity recognition field. In this paper, we propose the first label noise learning approach for the driver activity recognition task. Based on the cluster assumption, we initially enable the model to learn clustering-friendly low-dimensional representations from given videos and assign the resultant embeddings into clusters. We subsequently perform co-refinement within each cluster to smooth the classifier outputs. Furthermore, we propose a flexible sample selection strategy that combines two selection criteria without relying on any hyperparameters to filter clean samples from the training dataset. We also incorporate a self-adaptive parameter into the sample selection process to enforce balancing across classes. A comprehensive variety of experiments on the public Drive&Act dataset for all granularity levels demonstrates the superior performance of our method in comparison with other label-denoising methods derived from the image classification field.

Title: Efficient identification of linear, parameter-varying, and nonlinear systems with noise models
Authors: Alberto Bemporad, Roland Tóth
Abstract: We present a general system identification procedure capable of estimating of a broad spectrum of state-space dynamical models, including linear time-invariant (LTI), linear parameter-varying} (LPV), and nonlinear (NL) dynamics, along with rather general classes of noise models. Similar to the LTI case, we show that for this general class of model structures, including the NL case, the model dynamics can be separated into a deterministic process and a stochastic noise part, allowing to seamlessly tune the complexity of the combined model both in terms of nonlinearity and noise modeling. We parameterize the involved nonlinear functional relations by means of artificial neural-networks (ANNs), although alternative parametric nonlinear mappings can also be used. To estimate the resulting model structures, we optimize a prediction-error-based criterion using an efficient combination of a constrained quasi-Newton approach and automatic differentiation, achieving training times in the order of seconds compared to existing state-of-the-art ANN methods which may require hours for models of similar complexity. We formally establish the consistency guarantees for the proposed approach and demonstrate its superior estimation accuracy and computational efficiency on several benchmark LTI, LPV, and NL system identification problems.

Title: Voice Conversion with Diverse Intonation using Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder
Authors: Soobin Suh, Dabi Ahn, Heewoong Park, Jonghun Park
Abstract: Voice conversion is a task of synthesizing an utterance with target speaker's voice while maintaining linguistic information of the source utterance. While a speaker can produce varying utterances from a single script with different intonations, conventional voice conversion models were limited to producing only one result per source input. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach for voice conversion with diverse intonations using conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE). Experiments have shown that the speaker's style feature can be mapped into a latent space with Gaussian distribution. We have also been able to convert voices with more diverse intonation by making the posterior of the latent space more complex with inverse autoregressive flow (IAF). As a result, the converted voice not only has a diversity of intonations, but also has better sound quality than the model without CVAE.

Title: A Diffusion-Based Framework for Terrain-Aware Remote Sensing Image Reconstruction
Authors: Zhenyu Yu, Mohd Yamani Inda Idris, Pei Wang
Abstract: Remote sensing imagery is essential for environmental monitoring, agricultural management, and disaster response. However, data loss due to cloud cover, sensor failures, or incomplete acquisition-especially in high-resolution and high-frequency tasks-severely limits satellite imagery's effectiveness. Traditional interpolation methods struggle with large missing areas and complex structures. Remote sensing imagery consists of multiple bands, each with distinct meanings, and ensuring consistency across bands is critical to avoid anomalies in the combined images. This paper proposes SatelliteMaker, a diffusion-based method that reconstructs missing data across varying levels of data loss while maintaining spatial, spectral, and temporal consistency. We also propose Digital Elevation Model (DEM) as a conditioning input and use tailored prompts to generate realistic images, making diffusion models applicable to quantitative remote sensing tasks. Additionally, we propose a VGG-Adapter module based on Distribution Loss, which reduces distribution discrepancy and ensures style consistency. Extensive experiments show that SatelliteMaker achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks.

Title: Towards a General-Purpose Zero-Shot Synthetic Low-Light Image and Video Pipeline
Authors: Joanne Lin, Crispian Morris, Ruirui Lin, Fan Zhang, David Bull, Nantheera Anantrasirichai
Abstract: Low-light conditions pose significant challenges for both human and machine annotation. This in turn has led to a lack of research into machine understanding for low-light images and (in particular) videos. A common approach is to apply annotations obtained from high quality datasets to synthetically created low light versions. In addition, these approaches are often limited through the use of unrealistic noise models. In this paper, we propose a new Degradation Estimation Network (DEN), which synthetically generates realistic standard RGB (sRGB) noise without the requirement for camera metadata. This is achieved by estimating the parameters of physics-informed noise distributions, trained in a self-supervised manner. This zero-shot approach allows our method to generate synthetic noisy content with a diverse range of realistic noise characteristics, unlike other methods which focus on recreating the noise characteristics of the training data. We evaluate our proposed synthetic pipeline using various methods trained on its synthetic data for typical low-light tasks including synthetic noise replication, video enhancement, and object detection, showing improvements of up to 24\% KLD, 21\% LPIPS, and 62\% AP$_{50-95}$, respectively.

Title: SIDME: Self-supervised Image Demoiréing via Masked Encoder-Decoder Reconstruction
Authors: Xia Wang, Haiyang Sun, Tiantian Cao, Yueying Sun, Min Feng
Abstract: Moiré patterns, resulting from aliasing between object light signals and camera sampling frequencies, often degrade image quality during capture. Traditional demoiréing methods have generally treated images as a whole for processing and training, neglecting the unique signal characteristics of different color channels. Moreover, the randomness and variability of moiré pattern generation pose challenges to the robustness of existing methods when applied to real-world data. To address these issues, this paper presents SIDME (Self-supervised Image Demoiréing via Masked Encoder-Decoder Reconstruction), a novel model designed to generate high-quality visual images by effectively processing moiré patterns. SIDME combines a masked encoder-decoder architecture with self-supervised learning, allowing the model to reconstruct images using the inherent properties of camera sampling frequencies. A key innovation is the random masked image reconstructor, which utilizes an encoder-decoder structure to handle the reconstruction task. Furthermore, since the green channel in camera sampling has a higher sampling frequency compared to red and blue channels, a specialized self-supervised loss function is designed to improve the training efficiency and effectiveness. To ensure the generalization ability of the model, a self-supervised moiré image generation method has been developed to produce a dataset that closely mimics real-world conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIDME outperforms existing methods in processing real moiré pattern data, showing its superior generalization performance and robustness.

Title: Human Aligned Compression for Robust Models
Authors: Samuel Räber, Andreas Plesner, Till Aczel, Roger Wattenhofer
Abstract: Adversarial attacks on image models threaten system robustness by introducing imperceptible perturbations that cause incorrect predictions. We investigate human-aligned learned lossy compression as a defense mechanism, comparing two learned models (HiFiC and ELIC) against traditional JPEG across various quality levels. Our experiments on ImageNet subsets demonstrate that learned compression methods outperform JPEG, particularly for Vision Transformer architectures, by preserving semantically meaningful content while removing adversarial noise. Even in white-box settings where attackers can access the defense, these methods maintain substantial effectiveness. We also show that sequential compression--applying rounds of compression/decompression--significantly enhances defense efficacy while maintaining classification performance. Our findings reveal that human-aligned compression provides an effective, computationally efficient defense that protects the image features most relevant to human and machine understanding. It offers a practical approach to improving model robustness against adversarial threats.

Title: Edge Intelligence for Wildlife Conservation: Real-Time Hornbill Call Classification Using TinyML
Authors: Kong Ka Hing, Mehran Behjati
Abstract: Hornbills, an iconic species of Malaysia's biodiversity, face threats from habi-tat loss, poaching, and environmental changes, necessitating accurate and real-time population monitoring that is traditionally challenging and re-source intensive. The emergence of Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) offers a chance to transform wildlife monitoring by enabling efficient, real-time da-ta analysis directly on edge devices. Addressing the challenge of wildlife conservation, this research paper explores the pivotal role of machine learn-ing, specifically TinyML, in the classification and monitoring of hornbill calls in Malaysia. Leveraging audio data from the Xeno-canto database, the study aims to develop a speech recognition system capable of identifying and classifying hornbill vocalizations. The proposed methodology involves pre-processing the audio data, extracting features using Mel-Frequency Energy (MFE), and deploying the model on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE, which is adept at edge computing. The research encompasses foundational work, in-cluding a comprehensive introduction, literature review, and methodology. The model is trained using Edge Impulse and validated through real-world tests, achieving high accuracy in hornbill species identification. The project underscores the potential of TinyML for environmental monitoring and its broader application in ecological conservation efforts, contributing to both the field of TinyML and wildlife conservation.

Title: Dysarthria Normalization via Local Lie Group Transformations for Robust ASR
Authors: Mikhail Osipov
Abstract: We present a geometry-driven method for normalizing dysarthric speech using local Lie group transformations of spectrograms. Time, frequency, and amplitude distortions are modeled as smooth, invertible deformations, parameterized by scalar fields and applied via exponential maps. A neural network is trained to infer these fields from synthetic distortions of typical speech-without using any pathological data. At test time, the model applies an approximate inverse to real dysarthric inputs. Despite zero-shot generalization, we observe substantial ASR gains, including up to 16 percentage points WER reduction on challenging TORGO samples, with no degradation on clean speech. This work introduces a principled, interpretable approach for robust speech recognition under motor speech disorders

Title: Optimal flock formation induced by agent heterogeneity
Authors: Arthur N. Montanari, Ana Elisa D. Barioni, Chao Duan, Adilson E. Motter
Abstract: The study of flocking in biological systems has identified conditions for self-organized collective behavior, inspiring the development of decentralized strategies to coordinate the dynamics of swarms of drones and other autonomous vehicles. Previous research has focused primarily on the role of the time-varying interaction network among agents while assuming that the agents themselves are identical or nearly identical. Here, we depart from this conventional assumption to investigate how inter-individual differences between agents affect the stability and convergence in flocking dynamics. We show that flocks of agents with optimally assigned heterogeneous parameters significantly outperform their homogeneous counterparts, achieving 20-40% faster convergence to desired formations across various control tasks. These tasks include target tracking, flock formation, and obstacle maneuvering. In systems with communication delays, heterogeneity can enable convergence even when flocking is unstable for identical agents. Our results challenge existing paradigms in multi-agent control and establish system disorder as an adaptive, distributed mechanism to promote collective behavior in flocking dynamics.

Title: Deep Anatomical Federated Network (Dafne): An open client-server framework for the continuous, collaborative improvement of deep learning-based medical image segmentation
Authors: Francesco Santini, Jakob Wasserthal, Abramo Agosti, Xeni Deligianni, Kevin R. Keene, Hermien E. Kan, Stefan Sommer, Fengdan Wang, Claudia Weidensteiner, Giulia Manco, Matteo Paoletti, Valentina Mazzoli, Arjun Desai, Anna Pichiecchio
Abstract: Purpose: To present and evaluate Dafne (deep anatomical federated network), a freely available decentralized, collaborative deep learning system for the semantic segmentation of radiological images through federated incremental learning. Materials and Methods: Dafne is free software with a client-server architecture. The client side is an advanced user interface that applies the deep learning models stored on the server to the user's data and allows the user to check and refine the prediction. Incremental learning is then performed at the client's side and sent back to the server, where it is integrated into the root model. Dafne was evaluated locally, by assessing the performance gain across model generations on 38 MRI datasets of the lower legs, and through the analysis of real-world usage statistics (n = 639 use-cases). Results: Dafne demonstrated a statistically improvement in the accuracy of semantic segmentation over time (average increase of the Dice Similarity Coefficient by 0.007 points/generation on the local validation set, p < 0.001). Qualitatively, the models showed enhanced performance on various radiologic image types, including those not present in the initial training sets, indicating good model generalizability. Conclusion: Dafne showed improvement in segmentation quality over time, demonstrating potential for learning and generalization.

Title: a-DCF: an architecture agnostic metric with application to spoofing-robust speaker verification
Authors: Hye-jin Shim, Jee-weon Jung, Tomi Kinnunen, Nicholas Evans, Jean-Francois Bonastre, Itshak Lapidot
Abstract: Spoofing detection is today a mainstream research topic. Standard metrics can be applied to evaluate the performance of isolated spoofing detection solutions and others have been proposed to support their evaluation when they are combined with speaker detection. These either have well-known deficiencies or restrict the architectural approach to combine speaker and spoof detectors. In this paper, we propose an architecture-agnostic detection cost function (a-DCF). A generalisation of the original DCF used widely for the assessment of automatic speaker verification (ASV), the a-DCF is designed for the evaluation of spoofing-robust ASV. Like the DCF, the a-DCF reflects the cost of decisions in a Bayes risk sense, with explicitly defined class priors and detection cost model. We demonstrate the merit of the a-DCF through the benchmarking evaluation of architecturally-heterogeneous spoofing-robust ASV solutions.

Title: A Comparative Study of Artificial Potential Fields and Reciprocal Control Barrier Function-based Safety Filters
Authors: Ming Li, Zhiyong Sun
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that controllers designed by artificial potential fields (APFs) can be derived from reciprocal control barrier function quadratic program (RCBF-QP) safety filters. By integrating APFs within the RCBF-QP framework, we explicitly establish the relationship between these two approaches. Specifically, we first introduce the concepts of tightened control Lyapunov functions (T-CLFs) and tightened reciprocal control barrier functions (T-RCBFs), each of which incorporates a flexible auxiliary function. We then utilize an attractive potential field as a T-CLF to guide the nominal controller design, and a repulsive potential field as a T-RCBF to formulate an RCBF-QP safety filter. With appropriately chosen auxiliary functions, we show that controllers designed by APFs and those derived by RCBF-QP safety filters are equivalent. Based on this insight, we further generalize the APF-based controllers (equivalently, RCBF-QP safety filter-based controllers) to more general scenarios without restricting the choice of auxiliary functions. Finally, we present a collision avoidance example to clearly illustrate the connection and equivalence between the two methods.

Title: ECG-Chat: A Large ECG-Language Model for Cardiac Disease Diagnosis
Authors: Yubao Zhao, Jiaju Kang, Tian Zhang, Puyu Han, Tong Chen
Abstract: The success of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the medical auxiliary field shows great potential, allowing patients to engage in conversations using physiological signal data. However, general MLLMs perform poorly in cardiac disease diagnosis, particularly in the integration of ECG data analysis and medical report generation, mainly due to the complexity of ECG data analysis and the gap between text and ECG signal modalities. To address these issues, we propose ECG-Chat, a multitask MLLMs focused on ECG medical report generation, providing multimodal conversational capabilities based on cardiology knowledge. We propose a contrastive learning approach that integrates ECG waveform data with text reports, aligning ECG features with reports in a fine-grained manner. This method also results in an ECG encoder that excels in zero-shot report retrieval tasks. Additionally, expanding existing datasets, we constructed a 19k ECG diagnosis dataset and a 25k multi-turn dialogue dataset for training and fine-tuning ECG-Chat, which provides professional diagnostic and conversational capabilities. Furthermore, ECG-Chat can generate comprehensive ECG analysis reports through an automated LaTeX generation pipeline. We established a benchmark for the ECG report generation task and tested our model on multiple baselines. ECG-Chat achieved the best performance in classification, retrieval, and medical report generation tasks. Our code is available at this https URL.

Title: A Radio Map Approach for Reduced Pilot CSI Tracking in Massive MIMO Networks
Authors: Yuanshuai Zheng, Junting Chen
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems offer significant potential to enhance wireless communication performance, yet accurate and timely channel state information (CSI) acquisition remains a key challenge. Existing works on CSI estimation and radio map applications typically rely on stationary CSI statistics and accurate location labels. However, the CSI process can be discontinuous due to user mobility and environmental variations, and inaccurate location data can degrade the performance. By contrast, this paper studies radio-map-embedded CSI tracking and radio map construction without the assumptions of stationary CSI statistics and precise location labels. Using radio maps as the prior information, this paper develops a radio-map-embedded switching Kalman filter (SKF) framework that jointly tracks the location and the CSI with adaptive beamforming for sparse CSI observations under reduced pilots. For radio map construction without precise location labels, the location sequence and the channel covariance matrices are jointly estimated based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). An unbiased estimator on the channel covariance matrix is found. Numerical results on ray-traced MIMO channel datasets demonstrate that using 1 pilot in every 10 milliseconds, an average of over 97% of capacity over that of perfect CSI can be achieved, while a conventional Kalman filter (KF) can only achieve 76%. Furthermore, the proposed radio-map-embedded CSI model can reduce the localization error from 30 meters from the prior to 6 meters for radio map construction.

Title: Survey of Load-Altering Attacks Against Power Grids: Attack Impact, Detection and Mitigation
Authors: Sajjad Maleki, Shijie Pan, Subhash Lakshminarayana, Charalambos Konstantinou
Abstract: The growing penetration of IoT devices in power grids despite its benefits, raises cybersecurity concerns. In particular, load-altering attacks (LAAs) targeting high-wattage IoT-controllable load devices pose serious risks to grid stability and disrupt electricity markets. This paper provides a comprehensive review of LAAs, highlighting the threat model, analyzing their impact on transmission and distribution networks, and the electricity market dynamics. We also review the detection and localization schemes for LAAs that employ either model-based or data-driven approaches, with some hybrid methods combining the strengths of both. Additionally, mitigation techniques are examined, focusing on both preventive measures, designed to thwart attack execution, and reactive methods, which aim to optimize responses to ongoing attacks. We look into the application of each study and highlight potential streams for future research.

Title: Efficient Lung Ultrasound Severity Scoring Using Dedicated Feature Extractor
Authors: Jiaqi Guo, Yunan Wu, Evangelos Kaimakamis, Georgios Petmezas, Vasileios E. Papageorgiou, Nicos Maglaveras, Aggelos K. Katsaggelos
Abstract: With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, ultrasound imaging has emerged as a promising technique for COVID-19 detection, due to its non-invasive nature, affordability, and portability. In response, researchers have focused on developing AI-based scoring systems to provide real-time diagnostic support. However, the limited size and lack of proper annotation in publicly available ultrasound datasets pose significant challenges for training a robust AI model. This paper proposes MeDiVLAD, a novel pipeline to address the above issue for multi-level lung-ultrasound (LUS) severity scoring. In particular, we leverage self-knowledge distillation to pretrain a vision transformer (ViT) without label and aggregate frame-level features via dual-level VLAD aggregation. We show that with minimal finetuning, MeDiVLAD outperforms conventional fully-supervised methods in both frame- and video-level scoring, while offering classification reasoning with exceptional quality. This superior performance enables key applications such as the automatic identification of critical lung pathology areas and provides a robust solution for broader medical video classification tasks.

Title: Diffusion-empowered AutoPrompt MedSAM
Authors: Peng Huang, Shu Hu, Bo Peng, Xun Gong, Penghang Yin, Hongtu Zhu, Xi Wu, Xin Wang
Abstract: MedSAM, a medical foundation model derived from the SAM architecture, has demonstrated notable success across diverse medical domains. However, its clinical application faces two major challenges: the dependency on labor-intensive manual prompt generation, which imposes a significant burden on clinicians, and the absence of semantic labeling in the generated segmentation masks for organs or lesions, limiting its practicality for non-expert users. To address these limitations, we propose AutoMedSAM, an end-to-end framework derived from SAM, designed to enhance usability and segmentation performance. AutoMedSAM retains MedSAM's image encoder and mask decoder structure while introducing a novel diffusion-based class prompt encoder. The diffusion-based encoder employs a dual-decoder structure to collaboratively generate prompt embeddings guided by sparse and dense prompt definitions. These embeddings enhance the model's ability to understand and process clinical imagery autonomously. With this encoder, AutoMedSAM leverages class prompts to embed semantic information into the model's predictions, transforming MedSAM's semi-automated pipeline into a fully automated workflow. Furthermore, AutoMedSAM employs an uncertainty-aware joint optimization strategy during training to effectively inherit MedSAM's pre-trained knowledge while improving generalization by integrating multiple loss functions. Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate that AutoMedSAM achieves superior performance while broadening its applicability to both clinical settings and non-expert users.

Title: Dissipativity-Based Distributed Control and Communication Topology Co-Design for Voltage Regulation and Current Sharing in DC Microgrids
Authors: Mohammad Javad Najafirad, Shirantha Welikala
Abstract: This paper presents a novel dissipativity-based distributed droop-free control approach for voltage regulation and current sharing in DC microgrids (MGs) comprised of an interconnected set of distributed generators (DGs), loads, and power lines. First, we describe the closed-loop DC MG as a networked system where the DGs and lines (i.e., subsystems) are interconnected via a static interconnection matrix. This interconnection matrix demonstrates how the inputs, outputs, and disturbances of DGs and lines are connected in a DC MG. Each DG has a local controller and a distributed global controller. To design the controllers, we use the dissipativity properties of the subsystems and formulate a linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem. To support the feasibility of this problem, we identify a set of necessary local and global conditions that we then enforce in a specifically developed LMI-based local controller design process. In contrast to existing DC MG control solutions, our approach proposes a unified framework for co-designing the distributed controller and communication topology. As the co-design process is LMI-based, it can be efficiently implemented and evaluated using existing convex optimization tools. The effectiveness of the proposed solution was verified by simulating an islanded DC MG in a MATLAB/Simulink environment under different scenarios, such as load changes and topological constraint changes, and then comparing the performance with a recent droop control algorithm.

Title: WiFi-Diffusion: Achieving Fine-Grained WiFi Radio Map Estimation With Ultra-Low Sampling Rate by Diffusion Models
Authors: Zhiyuan Liu, Shuhang Zhang, Qingyu Liu, Hongliang Zhang, Lingyang Song
Abstract: Fine-grained radio map presents communication parameters of interest, e.g., received signal strength, at every point across a large geographical region. It can be leveraged to improve the efficiency of spectrum utilization for a large area, particularly critical for the unlicensed WiFi spectrum. The problem of fine-grained radio map estimation is to utilize radio samples collected by sparsely distributed sensors to infer the map. This problem is challenging due to the ultra-low sampling rate, where the number of available samples is far less than the fine-grained resolution required for radio map estimation. We propose WiFi-Diffusion -- a novel generative framework for achieving fine-grained WiFi radio map estimation using diffusion models. WiFi-Diffusion employs the creative power of generative AI to address the ultra-low sampling rate challenge and consists of three blocks: 1) a boost block, using prior information such as the layout of obstacles to optimize the diffusion model; 2) a generation block, leveraging the diffusion model to generate a candidate set of radio maps; and 3) an election block, utilizing the radio propagation model as a guide to find the best radio map from the candidate set. Extensive simulations demonstrate that 1) the fine-grained radio map generated by WiFi-Diffusion is ten times better than those produced by state-of-the-art (SOTA) when they use the same ultra-low sampling rate; and 2) WiFi-Diffusion achieves comparable fine-grained radio map quality with only one-fifth of the sampling rate required by SOTA.

Title: Sig2text, a Vision-language model for Non-cooperative Radar Signal Parsing
Authors: Hancong Feng KaiLI Jiang Bin tang
Abstract: Automatic non-cooperative analysis of intercepted radar signals is essential for intelligent equipment in both military and civilian domains. Accurate modulation identification and parameter estimation enable effective signal classification, threat assessment, and the development of countermeasures. In this paper, we propose a symbolic approach for radar signal recognition and parameter estimation based on a vision-language model that combines context-free grammar with time-frequency representation of radar waveforms. The proposed model, called Sig2text, leverages the power of vision transformers for time-frequency feature extraction and transformer-based decoders for symbolic parsing of radar waveforms. By treating radar signal recognition as a parsing problem, Sig2text can effectively recognize and parse radar waveforms with different modulation types and parameters. We evaluate the performance of Sig2text on a synthetic radar signal dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in recognizing and parsing radar waveforms with varying modulation types and parameters. The training code of the model is available at this https URL.

Authors: Snigdha Sen, Lorna Smith, Lucy Caselton, Joey Clemente, Maxine Tran, Shonit Punwani, David Atkinson, Richard L Hesketh, Eleftheria Panagiotaki
Abstract: This work aims to characterise renal tumour microstructure using diffusion MRI (dMRI); via the Vascular, Extracellular and Restricted Diffusion for Cytometry in Tumours (VERDICT)-MRI framework with self-supervised learning. Comprehensive datasets were acquired from 14 patients with 15 biopsy-confirmed renal tumours, with nine b-values in the range b=[0,2500]s/mm2. A three-compartment VERDICT model for renal tumours was fitted to the dMRI data using a self-supervised deep neural network, and ROIs were drawn by an experienced uroradiologist. An economical acquisition protocol for future studies with larger patient cohorts was optimised using a recursive feature selection approach. The VERDICT model described the diffusion data in renal tumours more accurately than IVIM or ADC. Combined with self-supervised deep learning, VERDICT identified significant differences in the intracellular volume fraction between cancerous and normal tissue, and in the vascular volume fraction between vascular and non-vascular. The feature selector yields a 4 b-value acquisition of b = [70,150,1000,2000], with a duration of 14 minutes.

Title: Distributed Optimization with Gradient Tracking over Heterogeneous Delay-Prone Directed Networks
Authors: Evagoras Makridis, Gabriele Oliva, Kasagatta Ramesh Narahari, Mohammadreza Doostmohammadian, Usman A. Khan, Themistoklis Charalambous
Abstract: In this paper, we address the distributed optimization problem over unidirectional networks with possibly time-invariant heterogeneous bounded transmission delays. In particular, we propose a modified version of the Accelerated Distributed Directed OPTimization (ADD-OPT) algorithm, herein called Robustified ADD-OPT (R-ADD-OPT), which is able to solve the distributed optimization problem, even when the communication links suffer from heterogeneous but bounded transmission delays. We show that if the gradient step-size of the R-ADD-OPT algorithm is within a certain range, which also depends on the maximum time delay in the network, then the nodes are guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution of the distributed optimization problem. The range of the gradient step-size that guarantees convergence can be computed a priori based on the maximum time delay in the network.

Title: Robust MPC for Uncertain Linear Systems -- Combining Model Adaptation and Iterative Learning
Authors: Hannes Petrenz, Johannes Köhler, Francesco Borrelli
Abstract: This paper presents a robust adaptive learning Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for linear systems with parametric uncertainties and additive disturbances performing iterative tasks. The approach iteratively refines the parameter estimates using set membership estimation. Performance enhancement over iterations is achieved by learning the terminal cost from data. Safety is enforced using a terminal set, which is also learned iteratively. The proposed method guarantees recursive feasibility, constraint satisfaction, and a robust bound on the closed-loop cost. Numerical simulations on a mass-spring-damper system demonstrate improved computational efficiency and control performance compared to an existing robust adaptive MPC approach.

Title: Traffic Congestion Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques
Authors: Rafed Muhammad Yasir, Naushin Nower, Mohammad Shoyaib
Abstract: The prediction of traffic congestion can serve a crucial role in making future decisions. Although many studies have been conducted regarding congestion, most of these could not cover all the important factors (e.g., weather conditions). We proposed a prediction model for traffic congestion that can predict congestion based on day, time and several weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity). To evaluate our model, it has been tested against the traffic data of New Delhi. With this model, congestion of a road can be predicted one week ahead with an average RMSE of 1.12. Therefore, this model can be used to take preventive measure beforehand.

Title: On the convergence result of the gradient-push algorithm on directed graphs with constant stepsize
Authors: Woocheol Choi, Doheon Kim, Seok-Bae Yun
Abstract: Distributed optimization has recieved a lot of interest due to its wide applications in various fields. It consists of multiple agents that connected by a graph and optimize a total cost in a collaborative way. Often in the applications, the graph of the agents is given by a directed graph. The gradient-push algorithm is a fundamental method for distributed optimization for which the agents are connected by a directed graph. Despite of its wide usage in the literatures, its convergence property has not been established well for the important case that the stepsize is constant and the domain is the entire space. This work proves that the gradient-push algorithm with stepsize $\alpha>0$ converges exponentially fast to an $O(\alpha)$-neighborhood of the optimizer if the stepsize $\alpha$ is less than a specific value. For the result, we assume that each cost is smooth and the total cost is strongly convex. Numerical experiments are provided to support the theoretical convergence result. \textcolor{black}{We also present a numerical test showing that the gradient-push algorithm may approach a small neighborhood of the minimizer faster than the Push-DIGing algorithm which is a variant of the gradient-push algorithm involving the communication of the gradient informations of the agents.

Title: Exploring Self-supervised Skeleton-based Action Recognition in Occluded Environments
Authors: Yifei Chen, Kunyu Peng, Alina Roitberg, David Schneider, Jiaming Zhang, Junwei Zheng, Yufan Chen, Ruiping Liu, Kailun Yang, Rainer Stiefelhagen
Abstract: To integrate action recognition into autonomous robotic systems, it is essential to address challenges such as person occlusions-a common yet often overlooked scenario in existing self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition methods. In this work, we propose IosPSTL, a simple and effective self-supervised learning framework designed to handle occlusions. IosPSTL combines a cluster-agnostic KNN imputer with an Occluded Partial Spatio-Temporal Learning (OPSTL) strategy. First, we pre-train the model on occluded skeleton sequences. Then, we introduce a cluster-agnostic KNN imputer that performs semantic grouping using k-means clustering on sequence embeddings. It imputes missing skeleton data by applying K-Nearest Neighbors in the latent space, leveraging nearby sample representations to restore occluded joints. This imputation generates more complete skeleton sequences, which significantly benefits downstream self-supervised models. To further enhance learning, the OPSTL module incorporates Adaptive Spatial Masking (ASM) to make better use of intact, high-quality skeleton sequences during training. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the occluded versions of the NTU-60 and NTU-120 datasets, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness under challenging conditions.

Title: Block Majorization Minimization with Extrapolation and Application to $β$-NMF
Authors: Le Thi Khanh Hien, Valentin Leplat, Nicolas Gillis
Abstract: We propose a Block Majorization Minimization method with Extrapolation (BMMe) for solving a class of multi-convex optimization problems. The extrapolation parameters of BMMe are updated using a novel adaptive update rule. By showing that block majorization minimization can be reformulated as a block mirror descent method, with the Bregman divergence adaptively updated at each iteration, we establish subsequential convergence for BMMe. We use this method to design efficient algorithms to tackle nonnegative matrix factorization problems with the $\beta$-divergences ($\beta$-NMF) for $\beta\in [1,2]$. These algorithms, which are multiplicative updates with extrapolation, benefit from our novel results that offer convergence guarantees. We also empirically illustrate the significant acceleration of BMMe for $\beta$-NMF through extensive experiments.

Title: StreamingT2V: Consistent, Dynamic, and Extendable Long Video Generation from Text
Authors: Roberto Henschel, Levon Khachatryan, Hayk Poghosyan, Daniil Hayrapetyan, Vahram Tadevosyan, Zhangyang Wang, Shant Navasardyan, Humphrey Shi
Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models enable the generation of high-quality videos that follow text instructions, making it easy to create diverse and individual content. However, existing approaches mostly focus on high-quality short video generation (typically 16 or 24 frames), ending up with hard-cuts when naively extended to the case of long video synthesis. To overcome these limitations, we introduce StreamingT2V, an autoregressive approach for long video generation of 80, 240, 600, 1200 or more frames with smooth transitions. The key components are:(i) a short-term memory block called conditional attention module (CAM), which conditions the current generation on the features extracted from the previous chunk via an attentional mechanism, leading to consistent chunk transitions, (ii) a long-term memory block called appearance preservation module, which extracts high-level scene and object features from the first video chunk to prevent the model from forgetting the initial scene, and (iii) a randomized blending approach that enables to apply a video enhancer autoregressively for infinitely long videos without inconsistencies between chunks. Experiments show that StreamingT2V generates high motion amount. In contrast, all competing image-to-video methods are prone to video stagnation when applied naively in an autoregressive manner. Thus, we propose with StreamingT2V a high-quality seamless text-to-long video generator that outperforms competitors with consistency and motion. Our code will be available at: this https URL

Title: A Semi-Self-Supervised Approach for Dense-Pattern Video Object Segmentation
Authors: Keyhan Najafian, Farhad Maleki, Lingling Jin, Ian Stavness
Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) -- predicting pixel-level regions for objects within each frame of a video -- is particularly challenging in agricultural scenarios, where videos of crops include hundreds of small, dense, and occluded objects (stems, leaves, flowers, pods) that sway and move unpredictably in the wind. Supervised training is the state-of-the-art for VOS, but it requires large, pixel-accurate, human-annotated videos, which are costly to produce for videos with many densely packed objects in each frame. To address these challenges, we proposed a semi-self-supervised spatiotemporal approach for dense-VOS (DVOS) using a diffusion-based method through multi-task (reconstruction and segmentation) learning. We train the model first with synthetic data that mimics the camera and object motion of real videos and then with pseudo-labeled videos. We evaluate our DVOS method for wheat head segmentation from a diverse set of videos (handheld, drone-captured, different field locations, and different growth stages -- spanning from Boot-stage to Wheat-mature and Harvest-ready). Despite using only a few manually annotated video frames, the proposed approach yielded a high-performing model, achieving a Dice score of 0.79 when tested on a drone-captured external test set. While our method was evaluated on wheat head segmentation, it can be extended to other crops and domains, such as crowd analysis or microscopic image analysis.

Title: Quantum Generative Learning for High-Resolution Medical Image Generation
Authors: Amena Khatun, Kübra Yeter Aydeniz, Yaakov S. Weinstein, Muhammad Usman
Abstract: Integration of quantum computing in generative machine learning models has the potential to offer benefits such as training speed-up and superior feature extraction. However, the existing quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) fail to generate high-quality images due to their patch-based, pixel-wise learning approaches. These methods capture only local details, ignoring the global structure and semantic information of images. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing a quantum image generative learning (QIGL) approach for high-quality medical image generation. Our proposed quantum generator leverages variational quantum circuit approach addressing scalability issues by extracting principal components from the images instead of dividing them into patches. Additionally, we integrate the Wasserstein distance within the QIGL framework to generate a diverse set of medical samples. Through a systematic set of simulations on X-ray images from knee osteoarthritis and medical MNIST datasets, our model demonstrates superior performance, achieving the lowest Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) scores compared to its classical counterpart and advanced QGAN models reported in the literature.

Title: Taming Data and Transformers for Audio Generation
Authors: Moayed Haji-Ali, Willi Menapace, Aliaksandr Siarohin, Guha Balakrishnan, Vicente Ordonez
Abstract: The scalability of ambient sound generators is hindered by data scarcity, insufficient caption quality, and limited scalability in model architecture. This work addresses these challenges by advancing both data and model scaling. First, we propose an efficient and scalable dataset collection pipeline tailored for ambient audio generation, resulting in AutoReCap-XL, the largest ambient audio-text dataset with over 47 million clips. To provide high-quality textual annotations, we propose AutoCap, a high-quality automatic audio captioning model. By adopting a Q-Former module and leveraging audio metadata, AutoCap substantially enhances caption quality, reaching a CIDEr score of $83.2$, a $3.2\%$ improvement over previous captioning models. Finally, we propose GenAu, a scalable transformer-based audio generation architecture that we scale up to 1.25B parameters. We demonstrate its benefits from data scaling with synthetic captions as well as model size scaling. When compared to baseline audio generators trained at similar size and data scale, GenAu obtains significant improvements of $4.7\%$ in FAD score, $11.1\%$ in IS, and $13.5\%$ in CLAP score. Our code, model checkpoints, and dataset are publicly available.

Title: reBEN: Refined BigEarthNet Dataset for Remote Sensing Image Analysis
Authors: Kai Norman Clasen, Leonard Hackel, Tom Burgert, Gencer Sumbul, Begüm Demir, Volker Markl
Abstract: This paper presents refined BigEarthNet (reBEN) that is a large-scale, multi-modal remote sensing dataset constructed to support deep learning (DL) studies for remote sensing image analysis. The reBEN dataset consists of 549,488 pairs of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image patches. To construct reBEN, we initially consider the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 tiles used to construct the BigEarthNet dataset and then divide them into patches of size 1200 m x 1200 m. We apply atmospheric correction to the Sentinel-2 patches using the latest version of the sen2cor tool, resulting in higher-quality patches compared to those present in BigEarthNet. Each patch is then associated with a pixel-level reference map and scene-level multi-labels. This makes reBEN suitable for pixel- and scene-based learning tasks. The labels are derived from the most recent CORINE Land Cover (CLC) map of 2018 by utilizing the 19-class nomenclature as in BigEarthNet. The use of the most recent CLC map results in overcoming the label noise present in BigEarthNet. Furthermore, we introduce a new geographical-based split assignment algorithm that significantly reduces the spatial correlation among the train, validation, and test sets with respect to those present in BigEarthNet. This increases the reliability of the evaluation of DL models. To minimize the DL model training time, we introduce software tools that convert the reBEN dataset into a DL-optimized data format. In our experiments, we show the potential of reBEN for multi-modal multi-label image classification problems by considering several state-of-the-art DL models. The pre-trained model weights, associated code, and complete dataset are available at this https URL.

Title: Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Robotic Skill Acquisition From a Suboptimal Demonstration
Authors: Chenlin Ming, Zitong Wang, Boxuan Zhang, Zhanxiang Cao, Xiaoming Duan, Jianping He
Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) has emerged as a crucial method for robots to acquire new skills. However, when given suboptimal task trajectory demonstrations with shape characteristics reflecting human preferences but subpar dynamic attributes such as slow motion, robots not only need to mimic the behaviors but also optimize the dynamic performance. In this work, we leverage optimization-based methods to search for a superior-performing trajectory whose shape is similar to that of the demonstrated trajectory. Specifically, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to quantify the difference between two trajectories and combine it with additional performance metrics, such as collision cost, to construct the cost function. Moreover, we develop a multi-policy version of the Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Motion Planning (STOMP), called MSTOMP, which is more stable and robust to parameter changes. To deal with the jitter in the demonstrated trajectory, we further utilize the gain-controlling method in the frequency domain to denoise the demonstration and propose a computationally more efficient metric, called Mean Square Error in the Spectrum (MSES), that measures the trajectories' differences in the frequency domain. We also theoretically highlight the connections between the time domain and the frequency domain methods. Finally, we verify our method in both simulation experiments and real-world experiments, showcasing its improved optimization performance and stability compared to existing methods.

Title: RISE-iEEG: Robust to Inter-Subject Electrodes Implantation Variability iEEG Classifier
Authors: Maryam Ostadsharif Memar, Navid Ziaei, Behzad Nazari, Ali Yousefi
Abstract: Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) is increasingly used for clinical and brain-computer interface applications due to its high spatial and temporal resolution. However, inter-subject variability in electrode implantation poses a challenge for developing generalized neural decoders. To address this, we introduce a novel decoder model that is robust to inter-subject electrode implantation variability. We call this model RISE-iEEG, which stands for Robust to Inter-Subject Electrode Implantation Variability iEEG Classifier. RISE-iEEG employs a deep neural network structure preceded by a participant-specific projection network. The projection network maps the neural data of individual participants onto a common low-dimensional space, compensating for the implantation variability. In other words, we developed an iEEG decoder model that can be applied across multiple participants' data without requiring the coordinates of electrode for each participant. The performance of RISE-iEEG across multiple datasets, including the Music Reconstruction dataset, and AJILE12 dataset, surpasses that of advanced iEEG decoder models such as HTNet and EEGNet. Our analysis shows that the performance of RISE-iEEG is about 7\% higher than that of HTNet and EEGNet in terms of F1 score, with an average F1 score of 0.83, which is the highest result among the evaluation methods defined. Furthermore, Our analysis of the projection network weights reveals that the Superior Temporal and Postcentral lobes are key encoding nodes for the Music Reconstruction and AJILE12 datasets, which aligns with the primary physiological principles governing these regions. This model improves decoding accuracy while maintaining interpretability and generalization.

Title: Shuffled Linear Regression via Spectral Matching
Authors: Hang Liu, Anna Scaglione
Abstract: Shuffled linear regression (SLR) seeks to estimate latent features through a linear transformation, complicated by unknown permutations in the measurement dimensions. This problem extends traditional least-squares (LS) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) approaches by jointly estimating the permutation, resulting in shuffled LS and shuffled LASSO formulations. Existing methods, constrained by the combinatorial complexity of permutation recovery, often address small-scale cases with limited measurements. In contrast, we focus on large-scale SLR, particularly suited for environments with abundant measurement samples. We propose a spectral matching method that efficiently resolves permutations by aligning spectral components of the measurement and feature covariances. Rigorous theoretical analyses demonstrate that our method achieves accurate estimates in both shuffled LS and shuffled LASSO settings, given a sufficient number of samples. Furthermore, we extend our approach to address simultaneous pose and correspondence estimation in image registration tasks. Experiments on synthetic datasets and real-world image registration scenarios show that our method outperforms existing algorithms in both estimation accuracy and registration performance.

Title: TerrAInav Sim: An Open-Source Simulation of UAV Aerial Imaging from Satellite Data
Authors: S. Parisa Dajkhosh, Peter M. Le, Orges Furxhi, Eddie L. Jacobs
Abstract: Capturing real-world aerial images for vision-based navigation (VBN) is challenging due to limited availability and conditions that make it nearly impossible to access all desired images from any location. The complexity increases when multiple locations are involved. State-of-the-art solutions, such as deploying UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) for aerial imaging or relying on existing research databases, come with significant limitations. TerrAInav Sim offers a compelling alternative by simulating a UAV to capture bird's-eye view map-based images at zero yaw with real-world visible-band specifications. This open-source tool allows users to specify the bounding box (top-left and bottom-right) coordinates of any region on a map. Without the need to physically fly a drone, the virtual Python UAV performs a raster search to capture images. Users can define parameters such as the flight altitude, aspect ratio, diagonal field of view of the camera, and the overlap between consecutive images. TerrAInav Sim's capabilities range from capturing a few low-altitude images for basic applications to generating extensive datasets of entire cities for complex tasks like deep learning. This versatility makes TerrAInav a valuable tool for not only VBN but also other applications, including environmental monitoring, construction, and city management. The open-source nature of the tool also allows for the extension of the raster search to other missions. A dataset of Memphis, TN, has been provided along with this simulator. A supplementary dataset is also provided, which includes data from a 3D world generation package for comparison.

Title: Enhancing LLMs for Power System Simulations: A Feedback-driven Multi-agent Framework
Authors: Mengshuo Jia, Zeyu Cui, Gabriela Hug
Abstract: The integration of experimental technologies with large language models (LLMs) is transforming scientific research. It positions AI as a versatile research assistant rather than a mere problem-solving tool. In the field of power systems, however, managing simulations -- one of the essential experimental technologies -- remains a challenge for LLMs due to their limited domain-specific knowledge, restricted reasoning capabilities, and imprecise handling of simulation parameters. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a feedback-driven, multi-agent framework. It incorporates three proposed modules: an enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module, an improved reasoning module, and a dynamic environmental acting module with an error-feedback mechanism. Validated on 69 diverse tasks from Daline and MATPOWER, this framework achieves success rates of 93.13% and 96.85%, respectively. It significantly outperforms ChatGPT 4o, o1-preview, and the fine-tuned GPT-4o, which all achieved a success rate lower than 30% on complex tasks. Additionally, the proposed framework also supports rapid, cost-effective task execution, completing each simulation in approximately 30 seconds at an average cost of 0.014 USD for tokens. Overall, this adaptable framework lays a foundation for developing intelligent LLM-based assistants for human researchers, facilitating power system research and beyond.

Title: Inferring Short-Sightedness in Dynamic Noncooperative Games
Authors: Cade Armstrong, Ryan Park, Xinjie Liu, Kushagra Gupta, David Fridovich-Keil
Abstract: Dynamic game theory is an increasingly popular tool for modeling multi-agent, e.g. human-robot, interactions. Game-theoretic models presume that each agent wishes to minimize a private cost function that depends on others' actions. These games typically evolve over a fixed time horizon, specifying how far into the future each agent plans. In practical settings, however, decision-makers may vary in foresightedness. We conjecture that quantifying and estimating each agent's foresightedness from online data will enable safer and more efficient interactions with other agents. To this end, we frame this inference problem as an \emph{inverse} dynamic game. We consider a specific parametrization of each agent's objective function that smoothly interpolates myopic and farsighted planning. Games of this form are readily transformed into parametric mixed complementarity problems; we exploit the directional differentiability of solutions to these problems with respect to their hidden parameters to solve for agents' foresightedness. We conduct two types of experiments: one with synthetically generated pedestrian motion at a crosswalk and the other with real-world intersection data involving people walking, biking, and driving vehicles. The results of these experiments demonstrate that explicitly inferring agents' foresightedness enables game-theoretic models to more accurately model agents' behavior. Specifically, our results show 33% more accurate prediction of foresighted behavior on average compared to the baseline in real-world scenarios.

Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Resource Allocation for Hybrid Bit and Generative Semantic Communications in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks
Authors: Chong Huang, Xuyang Chen, Gaojie Chen, Pei Xiao, Geoffrey Ye Li, Wei Huang
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel framework consisting of hybrid bit-level and generative semantic communications for efficient downlink image transmission within space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs). The proposed model comprises multiple low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and ground users. Considering the limitations in signal coverage and receiver antennas that make the direct communication between satellites and ground users unfeasible in many scenarios, thus UAVs serve as relays and forward images from satellites to the ground users. Our hybrid communication framework effectively combines bit-level transmission with several semantic-level image generation modes, optimizing bandwidth usage to meet stringent satellite link budget constraints and ensure communication reliability and low latency under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. To reduce the transmission delay while ensuring reconstruction quality for the ground user, we propose a novel metric to measure delay and reconstruction quality in the proposed system, and employ a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based strategy to optimize resource allocation in the proposed network. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in terms of communication resource conservation, reduced latency, and maintaining high image quality, significantly outperforming traditional solutions. Therefore, the proposed framework can ensure that real-time image transmission requirements in SAGINs, even under dynamic network conditions and user demand.

Title: FaceSpeak: Expressive and High-Quality Speech Synthesis from Human Portraits of Different Styles
Authors: Tian-Hao Zhang, Jiawei Zhang, Jun Wang, Xinyuan Qian, Xu-Cheng Yin
Abstract: Humans can perceive speakers' characteristics (e.g., identity, gender, personality and emotion) by their appearance, which are generally aligned to their voice style. Recently, vision-driven Text-to-speech (TTS) scholars grounded their investigations on real-person faces, thereby restricting effective speech synthesis from applying to vast potential usage scenarios with diverse characters and image styles. To solve this issue, we introduce a novel FaceSpeak approach. It extracts salient identity characteristics and emotional representations from a wide variety of image styles. Meanwhile, it mitigates the extraneous information (e.g., background, clothing, and hair color, etc.), resulting in synthesized speech closely aligned with a character's persona. Furthermore, to overcome the scarcity of multi-modal TTS data, we have devised an innovative dataset, namely Expressive Multi-Modal TTS, which is diligently curated and annotated to facilitate research in this domain. The experimental results demonstrate our proposed FaceSpeak can generate portrait-aligned voice with satisfactory naturalness and quality.

Title: Separate Source Channel Coding Is Still What You Need: An LLM-based Rethinking
Authors: Tianqi Ren, Rongpeng Li, Ming-min Zhao, Xianfu Chen, Guangyi Liu, Yang Yang, Zhifeng Zhao, Honggang Zhang
Abstract: Along with the proliferating research interest in Semantic Communication (SemCom), Joint Source Channel Coding (JSCC) has dominated the attention due to the widely assumed existence in efficiently delivering information semantics. %has emerged as a pivotal area of research, aiming to enhance the efficiency and reliability of information transmission through deep learning-based methods. Nevertheless, this paper challenges the conventional JSCC paradigm, and advocates for adoption of Separate Source Channel Coding (SSCC) to enjoy the underlying more degree of freedom for optimization. We demonstrate that SSCC, after leveraging the strengths of Large Language Model (LLM) for source coding and Error Correction Code Transformer (ECCT) complemented for channel decoding, offers superior performance over JSCC. Our proposed framework also effectively highlights the compatibility challenges between SemCom approaches and digital communication systems, particularly concerning the resource costs associated with the transmission of high precision floating point numbers. Through comprehensive evaluations, we establish that empowered by LLM-based compression and ECCT-enhanced error correction, SSCC remains a viable and effective solution for modern communication systems. In other words, separate source and channel coding is still what we need!

Authors: Johannes Huemer, Markus Murschitz, Matthias Schörghuber, Lukas Reisinger, Thomas Kadiofsky, Christoph Weidinger, Mario Niedermeyer, Benedikt Widy, Marcel Zeilinger, Csaba Beleznai, Tobias Glück, Andreas Kugi, Patrik Zips
Abstract: Efficient material logistics play a critical role in controlling costs and schedules in the construction industry. However, manual material handling remains prone to inefficiencies, delays, and safety risks. Autonomous forklifts offer a promising solution to streamline on-site logistics, reducing reliance on human operators and mitigating labor shortages. This paper presents the development and evaluation of ADAPT (Autonomous Dynamic All-terrain Pallet Transporter), a fully autonomous off-road forklift designed for construction environments. Unlike structured warehouse settings, construction sites pose significant challenges, including dynamic obstacles, unstructured terrain, and varying weather conditions. To address these challenges, our system integrates AI-driven perception techniques with traditional approaches for decision making, planning, and control, enabling reliable operation in complex environments. We validate the system through extensive real-world testing, comparing its continuous performance against an experienced human operator across various weather conditions. Our findings demonstrate that autonomous outdoor forklifts can operate near human-level performance, offering a viable path toward safer and more efficient construction logistics.

Title: Efficient Transformed Gaussian Process State-Space Models for Non-Stationary High-Dimensional Dynamical Systems
Authors: Zhidi Lin, Ying Li, Feng Yin, Juan Maroñas, Alexandre H. Thiéry
Abstract: Gaussian process state-space models (GPSSMs) offer a principled framework for learning and inference in nonlinear dynamical systems with uncertainty quantification. However, existing GPSSMs are limited by the use of multiple independent stationary Gaussian processes (GPs), leading to prohibitive computational and parametric complexity in high-dimensional settings and restricted modeling capacity for non-stationary dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient transformed Gaussian process state-space model (ETGPSSM) for scalable and flexible modeling of high-dimensional, non-stationary dynamical systems. Specifically, our ETGPSSM integrates a single shared GP with input-dependent normalizing flows, yielding an expressive implicit process prior that captures complex, non-stationary transition dynamics while significantly reducing model complexity. For the inference of the implicit process, we develop a variational inference algorithm that jointly approximates the posterior over the underlying GP and the neural network parameters defining the normalizing flows. To avoid explicit variational parameterization of the latent states, we further incorporate the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) into the variational framework, enabling accurate and efficient state estimation. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our ETGPSSM in system dynamics learning, high-dimensional state estimation, and time-series forecasting, outperforming existing GPSSMs and neural network-based SSMs in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy.

Title: Conformal Calibration: Ensuring the Reliability of Black-Box AI in Wireless Systems
Authors: Osvaldo Simeone, Sangwoo Park, Matteo Zecchin
Abstract: AI is poised to revolutionize telecommunication networks by boosting efficiency, automation, and decision-making. However, the black-box nature of most AI models introduces substantial risk, possibly deterring adoption by network operators. These risks are not addressed by the current prevailing deployment strategy, which typically follows a best-effort train-and-deploy paradigm. This paper reviews conformal calibration, a general framework that moves beyond the state of the art by adopting computationally lightweight, advanced statistical tools that offer formal reliability guarantees without requiring further training or fine-tuning. Conformal calibration encompasses pre-deployment calibration via uncertainty quantification or hyperparameter selection; online monitoring to detect and mitigate failures in real time; and counterfactual post-deployment performance analysis to address "what if" diagnostic questions after deployment. By weaving conformal calibration into the AI model lifecycle, network operators can establish confidence in black-box AI models as a dependable enabling technology for wireless systems.

Title: $π$-MPPI: A Projection-based Model Predictive Path Integral Scheme for Smooth Optimal Control of Fixed-Wing Aerial Vehicles
Authors: Edvin Martin Andrejev, Amith Manoharan, Karl-Eerik Unt, Arun Kumar Singh
Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) is a popular sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm for nonlinear systems. It optimizes trajectories by sampling control sequences and averaging them. However, a key issue with MPPI is the non-smoothness of the optimal control sequence, leading to oscillations in systems like fixed-wing aerial vehicles (FWVs). Existing solutions use post-hoc smoothing, which fails to bound control derivatives. This paper introduces a new approach: we add a projection filter $\pi$ to minimally correct control samples, ensuring bounds on control magnitude and higher-order derivatives. The filtered samples are then averaged using MPPI, leading to our $\pi$-MPPI approach. We minimize computational overhead by using a neural accelerated custom optimizer for the projection filter. $\pi$-MPPI offers a simple way to achieve arbitrary smoothness in control sequences. While we focus on FWVs, this projection filter can be integrated into any MPPI pipeline. Applied to FWVs, $\pi$-MPPI is easier to tune than the baseline, resulting in smoother, more robust performance.

Title: Self-Supervised Enhancement of Forward-Looking Sonar Images: Bridging Cross-Modal Degradation Gaps through Feature Space Transformation and Multi-Frame Fusion
Authors: Zhisheng Zhang, Peng Zhang, Fengxiang Wang, Liangli Ma, Fuchun Sun
Abstract: Enhancing forward-looking sonar images is critical for accurate underwater target detection. Current deep learning methods mainly rely on supervised training with simulated data, but the difficulty in obtaining high-quality real-world paired data limits their practical use and generalization. Although self-supervised approaches from remote sensing partially alleviate data shortages, they neglect the cross-modal degradation gap between sonar and remote sensing images. Directly transferring pretrained weights often leads to overly smooth sonar images, detail loss, and insufficient brightness. To address this, we propose a feature-space transformation that maps sonar images from the pixel domain to a robust feature domain, effectively bridging the degradation gap. Additionally, our self-supervised multi-frame fusion strategy leverages complementary inter-frame information to naturally remove speckle noise and enhance target-region brightness. Experiments on three self-collected real-world forward-looking sonar datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, effectively suppressing noise, preserving detailed edges, and substantially improving brightness, demonstrating strong potential for underwater target detection applications.
