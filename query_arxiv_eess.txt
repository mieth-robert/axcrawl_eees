Title: Physics-informed Modularized Neural Network for Advanced Building Control by Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Zixin Jiang, Xuezheng Wang, Bing Dong
Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) provides a promising solution for building energy modeling and can serve as a virtual environment to enable reinforcement learning (RL) agents to interact and learn. However, challenges remain in efficiently integrating physics priors, evaluating the effectiveness of physics constraints, balancing model accuracy and physics consistency, and enabling real-world implementation. To address these gaps, this study introduces a Physics-Informed Modularized Neural Network (PI-ModNN), which incorporates physics priors through a physics-informed model structure, loss functions, and hard constraints. A new evaluation metric called "temperature response violation" is developed to quantify the physical consistency of data-driven building dynamic models under varying control inputs and training data sizes. Additionally, a physics prior evaluation framework based on rule importance is proposed to assess the contribution of each individual physics prior, offering guidance on selecting appropriate PIML techniques. Results indicate that incorporating physical priors does not always improve model performance; inappropriate priors may decrease model accuracy and consistency. However, hard constraints are effective in enforcing model consistency. Furthermore, we present a general workflow for developing control-oriented PIML models and integrating them with deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Following this framework, a case study implementing DRL in an office space over three months demonstrates potential energy savings of 31.4%. Finally, we provide a general guideline for integrating data-driven models with advanced building control through a four-step evaluation framework, paving the way for reliable and scalable deployment of advanced building controls.

Title: A Novel Approach to Linking Histology Images with DNA Methylation
Authors: Manahil Raza, Muhammad Dawood, Talha Qaiser, Nasir M. Rajpoot
Abstract: DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that regulates gene expression by adding methyl groups to DNA. Abnormal methylation patterns can disrupt gene expression and have been linked to cancer development. To quantify DNA methylation, specialized assays are typically used. However, these assays are often costly and have lengthy processing times, which limits their widespread availability in routine clinical practice. In contrast, whole slide images (WSIs) for the majority of cancer patients can be more readily available. As such, given the ready availability of WSIs, there is a compelling need to explore the potential relationship between WSIs and DNA methylation patterns. To address this, we propose an end-to-end graph neural network based weakly supervised learning framework to predict the methylation state of gene groups exhibiting coherent patterns across samples. Using data from three cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) - TCGA-LGG (Brain Lower Grade Glioma), TCGA-GBM (Glioblastoma Multiforme) ($n$=729) and TCGA-KIRC (Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma) ($n$=511) - we demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significantly higher AUROC scores than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, by more than $20\%$. We conduct gene set enrichment analyses on the gene groups and show that majority of the gene groups are significantly enriched in important hallmarks and pathways. We also generate spatially enriched heatmaps to further investigate links between histological patterns and DNA methylation states. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that explores association of spatially resolved histological patterns with gene group methylation states across multiple cancer types using weakly supervised deep learning.

Title: Large-Scale Classification of Shortwave Communication Signals with Machine Learning
Authors: Stefan Scholl
Abstract: This paper presents a deep learning approach to the classification of 160 shortwave radio signals. It addresses the typical challenges of the shortwave spectrum, which are the large number of different signal types, the presence of various analog modulations and ionospheric propagation. As a classifier a deep convolutional neural network is used, that is trained to recognize 160 typical shortwave signal classes. The approach is blind and therefore does not require preknowledge or special preprocessing of the signal and no manual design of discriminative features for each signal class. The network is trained on a large number of synthetically generated signals and high quality recordings. Finally, the network is evaluated on real-world radio signals obtained from globally deployed receiver hardware and achieves up to 90% accuracy for an observation time of only 1 second.

Title: A Solid-State Nanopore Signal Generator for Training Machine Learning Models
Authors: Jaise Johnson, Chinmayi R Galigekere, Manoj M Varma
Abstract: Translocation event detection from raw nanopore current signals is a fundamental step in nanopore signal analysis. Traditional data analysis methods rely on user-defined parameters to extract event information, making the interpretation of experimental results sensitive to parameter choice. While Machine Learning (ML) has seen widespread adoption across various scientific fields, its potential remains underexplored in solid-state nanopore research. In this work, we introduce a nanopore signal generator capable of producing extensive synthetic datasets for machine learning applications and benchmarking nanopore signal analysis platforms. Using this generator, we train deep learning models to detect translocation events directly from raw signals, achieving over 99% true event detection with minimal false positives.

Title: Debiasing Continuous-time Nonlinear Autoregressions
Authors: Simon Kuang, Xinfan Lin
Abstract: We study how to identify a class of continuous-time nonlinear systems defined by an ordinary differential equation affine in the unknown parameter. We define a notion of asymptotic consistency as $(n, h) \to (\infty, 0)$, and we achieve it using a family of direct methods where the first step is differentiating a noisy time series and the second step is a plug-in linear estimator. The first step, differentiation, is a signal processing adaptation of the nonparametric statistical technique of local polynomial regression. The second step, generalized linear regression, can be consistent using a least squares estimator, but we demonstrate two novel bias corrections that improve the accuracy for finite $h$. These methods significantly broaden the class of continuous-time systems that can be consistently estimated by direct methods.

Title: Extended Sensitivity-Aware Reactive Power Dispatch Algorithm for Smart Inverters with Multiple Control Modes
Authors: Mohammad Almomani, Ahmed Alkhonain, Venkataramana Ajjarapu
Abstract: The increasing integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in distribution networks presents new challenges for voltage regulation and reactive power support. This paper extends a sensitivity-aware reactive power dispatch algorithm tailored to manage smart inverters operating under different control modes, including PQ, PV, and Volt-Var (VV). The proposed approach dynamically optimizes reactive power dispatch and voltage setpoints, enabling effective coordination among distribution systems as a virtual power plant (VPP) to support the transmission network. The algorithm is applied to the IEEE 13-bus and IEEE-123 bus test systems, and its performance is validated by comparing results with OpenDSS simulations across various operating scenarios. Results show that the maximum error in the voltages is less than 0.015 pu.

Title: Novel Data-Driven Indices for Early Detection and Quantification of Short-Term Voltage Instability from Voltage Trajectories
Authors: Mohammad Almomani, Muhammad Sarwar, Venkataramana Ajjarapu
Abstract: This paper presents a novel Short-Term Voltage Stability Index (STVSI), which leverages Lyapunov Exponent-based detection to assess and quantify short-term stability triggered by Over Excitation Limiters (OELs) or undamped oscillations in voltage. The proposed method is measurement-based and decomposes the voltage trajectory into two key components using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD): a residual part, which indicates delayed voltage recovery, and an oscillatory part, which captures oscillations. The residual component is critical, as it can detect activation of OELs in synchronous generators or Low Voltage Ride-Through (LVRT) relays in inverter-based resources, potentially leading to instability within the quasisteady-state time frame. Meanwhile, the oscillatory component may indicate either a stable or unstable state in the short term. To accurately assess stability, STVSI employs an entropy-based metric to measure the proximity of the system to instability, with specific indices for short-term voltage stability based on oscillations and recovery. Simulations on the Nordic power system demonstrate that STVSI effectively identifies and categorizes voltage stability issues. Moreover, STVSI not only detects voltage stability conditions but also qualitatively assesses the extent of stability, providing a nuanced measure of stability.

Title: Enhanced Entropy-Based Metric for Characterization of Delayed Voltage Recovery
Authors: Mohammad Almomani, Muhammad Sarwar, Venkataramana Ajjarapu
Abstract: Ensuring accurate violation detection in power systems is paramount for operational reliability. This paper introduces an enhanced voltage recovery violation index (EVRVI), a comprehensive index designed to quantify fault-induced delayed voltage recovery (FIDVR). EVRVI enhances traditional entropy-based methods by leveraging Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) to extract key features from the voltage signal, which are then used to quantify over-voltage (OV) and under-voltage (UV) events. Our simulations on the Nordic system, involving over 245k scenarios, demonstrate EVRVI's superior ability to identify and categorize voltage recovery issues compared to the traditional entropy-based measure. EVRVI not only significantly reduces false negatives in violation detection but also provides a reliable framework for over-voltage detection, making it an invaluable tool for modern power system studies.

Title: Adaptive Control of Dual-Rotor Rotational System with Unknown Geometry and Unknown Inertia
Authors: Mohammad Mirtaba, Jhon Manuel Portella Delgado, Ankit Goel
Abstract: This paper develops an input-output feedback linearization-based adaptive controller to stabilize and regulate a dual-rotor rotational system (DRRS), whose inertial properties as well as the geometric configuration of rotors are unknown. First, the equations of motion governing the dynamics of DRRS are derived using the Newton-Euler approach. Next, an input-output feedback linearization technique is used to linearize the dynamics from the rotor speeds to the angular position of the system. A finite-time convergent estimator, based on the portion of the DRRS dynamics, is used to update the required parameters in the controller. Finally, the proposed controller is validated in both step and harmonic command-following problems, and the robustness of the controller to the system's parameters is demonstrated.

Title: Class Imbalance Correction for Improved Universal Lesion Detection and Tagging in CT
Authors: Peter D. Erickson, Tejas Sudharshan Mathai, Ronald M. Summers
Abstract: Radiologists routinely detect and size lesions in CT to stage cancer and assess tumor burden. To potentially aid their efforts, multiple lesion detection algorithms have been developed with a large public dataset called DeepLesion (32,735 lesions, 32,120 CT slices, 10,594 studies, 4,427 patients, 8 body part labels). However, this dataset contains missing measurements and lesion tags, and exhibits a severe imbalance in the number of lesions per label category. In this work, we utilize a limited subset of DeepLesion (6\%, 1331 lesions, 1309 slices) containing lesion annotations and body part label tags to train a VFNet model to detect lesions and tag them. We address the class imbalance by conducting three experiments: 1) Balancing data by the body part labels, 2) Balancing data by the number of lesions per patient, and 3) Balancing data by the lesion size. In contrast to a randomly sampled (unbalanced) data subset, our results indicated that balancing the body part labels always increased sensitivity for lesions >= 1cm for classes with low data quantities (Bone: 80\% vs. 46\%, Kidney: 77\% vs. 61\%, Soft Tissue: 70\% vs. 60\%, Pelvis: 83\% vs. 76\%). Similar trends were seen for three other models tested (FasterRCNN, RetinaNet, FoveaBox). Balancing data by lesion size also helped the VFNet model improve recalls for all classes in contrast to an unbalanced dataset. We also provide a structured reporting guideline for a ``Lesions'' subsection to be entered into the ``Findings'' section of a radiology report. To our knowledge, we are the first to report the class imbalance in DeepLesion, and have taken data-driven steps to address it in the context of joint lesion detection and tagging.

Title: Impact Assessment of Cyberattacks in Inverter-Based Microgrids
Authors: Kerd Topallaj, Colin McKerrell, Suraj Ramanathan, Ioannis Zografopoulos
Abstract: In recent years, the evolution of modern power grids has been driven by the growing integration of remotely controlled grid assets. Although Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and Inverter-Based Resources (IBR) enhance operational efficiency, they also introduce cybersecurity risks. The remote accessibility of such critical grid components creates entry points for attacks that adversaries could exploit, posing threats to the stability of the system. To evaluate the resilience of energy systems under such threats, this study employs real-time simulation and a modified version of the IEEE 39-bus system that incorporates a Microgrid (MG) with solar-based IBR. The study assesses the impact of remote attacks impacting the MG stability under different levels of IBR penetrations through Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulations. Namely, we analyze voltage, current, and frequency profiles before, during, and after cyberattack-induced disruptions. The results demonstrate that real-time HIL testing is a practical approach to uncover potential risks and develop robust mitigation strategies for resilient MG operations.

Authors: Jungkyu Park, Jan Witowski, Yanqi Xu, Hari Trivedi, Judy Gichoya, Beatrice Brown-Mulry, Malte Westerhoff, Linda Moy, Laura Heacock, Alana Lewin, Krzysztof J. Geras
Abstract: Although digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) improves diagnostic performance over full-field digital mammography (FFDM), false-positive recalls remain a concern in breast cancer screening. We developed a multi-modal artificial intelligence system integrating FFDM, synthetic mammography, and DBT to provide breast-level predictions and bounding-box localizations of suspicious findings. Our AI system, trained on approximately 500,000 mammography exams, achieved 0.945 AUROC on an internal test set. It demonstrated capacity to reduce recalls by 31.7% and radiologist workload by 43.8% while maintaining 100% sensitivity, underscoring its potential to improve clinical workflows. External validation confirmed strong generalizability, reducing the gap to a perfect AUROC by 35.31%-69.14% relative to strong baselines. In prospective deployment across 18 sites, the system reduced recall rates for low-risk cases. An improved version, trained on over 750,000 exams with additional labels, further reduced the gap by 18.86%-56.62% across large external datasets. Overall, these results underscore the importance of utilizing all available imaging modalities, demonstrate the potential for clinical impact, and indicate feasibility of further reduction of the test error with increased training set when using large-capacity neural networks.

Title: Nes2Net: A Lightweight Nested Architecture for Foundation Model Driven Speech Anti-spoofing
Authors: Tianchi Liu, Duc-Tuan Truong, Rohan Kumar Das, Kong Aik Lee, Haizhou Li
Abstract: Speech foundation models have significantly advanced various speech-related tasks by providing exceptional representation capabilities. However, their high-dimensional output features often create a mismatch with downstream task models, which typically require lower-dimensional inputs. A common solution is to apply a dimensionality reduction (DR) layer, but this approach increases parameter overhead, computational costs, and risks losing valuable information. To address these issues, we propose Nested Res2Net (Nes2Net), a lightweight back-end architecture designed to directly process high-dimensional features without DR layers. The nested structure enhances multi-scale feature extraction, improves feature interaction, and preserves high-dimensional information. We first validate Nes2Net on CtrSVDD, a singing voice deepfake detection dataset, and report a 22% performance improvement and an 87% back-end computational cost reduction over the state-of-the-art baseline. Additionally, extensive testing across four diverse datasets: ASVspoof 2021, ASVspoof 5, PartialSpoof, and In-the-Wild, covering fully spoofed speech, adversarial attacks, partial spoofing, and real-world scenarios, consistently highlights Nes2Net's superior robustness and generalization capabilities. The code package and pre-trained models are available at this https URL.

Title: Covariance-Intersection-based Distributed Kalman Filtering: Stability Problems Revisited
Authors: Zhongyao Hu, Bo Chen, Chao Sun, Li Yu
Abstract: This paper studies the stability of covariance-intersection (CI)-based distributed Kalman filtering in time-varying systems. For the general time-varying case, a relationship between the error covariance and the observability Gramian is established. Utilizing this relationship, we demonstrate an intuition that the stability of a node is only related to the observability of those nodes that can reach it uniformly. For the periodic time-varying case, it is proved by a monotonicity analysis method that CI-based distributed Kalman filtering converges periodically for any initial condition. The convergent point is shown to be the unique positive definite solution to a Riccati-like equation. Additionally, by constructing an intermediate difference equation, the closed-loop transition matrix of the estimation error system is proved to be Schur stable. Notably, all theoretical results are obtained without requiring network connectivity assumptions. Finally, simulations verify the effectiveness of the stability results.

Title: POMATO: Marrying Pointmap Matching with Temporal Motion for Dynamic 3D Reconstruction
Authors: Songyan Zhang, Yongtao Ge, Jinyuan Tian, Guangkai Xu, Hao Chen, Chen Lv, Chunhua Shen
Abstract: 3D reconstruction in dynamic scenes primarily relies on the combination of geometry estimation and matching modules where the latter task is pivotal for distinguishing dynamic regions which can help to mitigate the interference introduced by camera and object motion. Furthermore, the matching module explicitly models object motion, enabling the tracking of specific targets and advancing motion understanding in complex scenarios. Recently, the proposed representation of pointmap in DUSt3R suggests a potential solution to unify both geometry estimation and matching in 3D space, but it still struggles with ambiguous matching in dynamic regions, which may hamper further improvement. In this work, we present POMATO, a unified framework for dynamic 3D reconstruction by marrying pointmap matching with temporal motion. Specifically, our method first learns an explicit matching relationship by mapping RGB pixels from both dynamic and static regions across different views to 3D pointmaps within a unified coordinate system. Furthermore, we introduce a temporal motion module for dynamic motions that ensures scale consistency across different frames and enhances performance in tasks requiring both precise geometry and reliable matching, most notably 3D point tracking. We show the effectiveness of the proposed pointmap matching and temporal fusion paradigm by demonstrating the remarkable performance across multiple downstream tasks, including video depth estimation, 3D point tracking, and pose estimation.

Authors: Sidhiq Mardianta, Affandy, Catur Supriyanto, Catur Supriyanto, Adi Wijaya
Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the major complications in diabetic patients' eyes, potentially leading to permanent blindness if not detected timely. This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) in diagnosing DR. The method employed is the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) algorithm, applied to identify DR and its severity stages from fundus images using the public dataset "APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection." Literature was reviewed via ScienceDirect, ResearchGate, Google Scholar, and IEEE Xplore. Classification results using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) showed the best performance for the binary classes normal (0) and DR (1) with an accuracy of 99.55%, precision of 99.54%, recall of 99.54%, and F1-score of 99.54%. For the multiclass classification No_DR (0), Mild (1), Moderate (2), Severe (3), Proliferate_DR (4), the accuracy was 95.26%, precision 95.26%, recall 95.17%, and F1-score 95.23%. Evaluation using the confusion matrix yielded results of 99.68% for binary classification and 96.65% for multiclass. This study highlights the significant potential in enhancing the accuracy of DR diagnosis compared to traditional human analysis

Abstract: This study addresses the preamble detection problem in the Random Access procedure of LTE/5G networks by formulating it as a multi-class classification task and evaluating the effectiveness of machine learning techniques. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is implemented and compared against conventional detection methods. The proposed approach improves preamble index assignment, enhancing detection efficiency for User Equipment (UE) accessing the network. Performance analysis demonstrates that the SVM-based solution increases detection accuracy while reducing missed detections. These findings underscore the potential of machine learning in optimizing the Random Access procedure and improving network accessibility.

Title: A Douglas-Rachford Splitting Method for Solving Monotone Variational Inequalities in Linear-quadratic Dynamic Games
Authors: Reza Rahimi Baghbadorani, Emilio Benenati, Sergio Grammatico
Abstract: This paper considers constrained linear dynamic games with quadratic objective functions, which can be cast as affine variational inequalities. By leveraging the problem structure, we apply the Douglas-Rachford splitting, which generates a solution algorithm with linear convergence rate. The fast convergence of the method enables receding-horizon control architectures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the associated VI admits a closed-form solution within a neighborhood of the attractor, thus allowing for a further reduction in computation time. Finally, we benchmark the proposed method via numerical experiments in an automated driving application.

Title: Unimodular Waveform Design for Integrated Sensing and Communication MIMO System via Manifold Optimization
Authors: Jiangtao Wang, Xuyang Zhao, Muyu Mei, Yongchao Wang
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been widely recognized as one of the key technologies for 6G wireless networks. In this paper, we focus on the waveform design of ISAC system, which can realize radar sensing while also facilitate information transmission. The main content is as follows: first, we formulate the waveform design problem as a nonconvex and non-smooth model with a unimodulus constraint based on the measurement metric of the radar and communication system. Second, we transform the model into an unconstrained problem on the Riemannian manifold and construct the corresponding operators by analyzing the unimodulus constraint. Third, to achieve the solution efficiently, we propose a low-complexity non-smooth unimodulus manifold gradient descent (N-UMGD) algorithm with theoretical convergence guarantee. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can concentrate the energy of the sensing signal in the desired direction and realize information transmission with a low bit error rate.

Title: A Control-Oriented Simplified Single Particle Model with Grouped Parameter and Sensitivity Analysis for Lithium-Ion Batteries
Authors: Feng Guoa, Luis D. Couto
Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in transportation, energy storage, and consumer electronics, driving the need for reliable battery management systems (BMS) for state estimation and control. The Single Particle Model (SPM) balances computational efficiency and accuracy but faces challenges in parameter estimation due to numerous parameters. Current SPM models using parabolic approximation introduce intermediate variables and hard to do parameter grouping. This study presents a control-oriented SPM reformulation that employs parameter grouping and parabolic approximation to simplify model parameters while using average and surface lithium-ion concentrations as model output. By parameter grouping, the original 17 parameters were reduced to 9 grouped parameters. The reformulated model achieves a reduced-order ordinary differential equation form while maintaining mathematical accuracy equivalent to the pre-grouped discretized SPM. Through Sobol sensitivity analysis under various current profiles, the grouped parameters were reduced from 9 to 6 highly sensitive parameters. Results demonstrate that estimating these 6 parameters achieves comparable practical accuracy to estimating all 9 parameters, with faster convergence. This control-oriented SPM enhances BMS applications by facilitating state estimation and control while reducing parameter estimation requirements.

Title: Adaptive Extended Kalman Filtering for Battery State of Charge Estimation on STM32
Authors: António Barros, Edoardo Peretti, Davide Fabroni, Diego Carrera, Pasqualina Fragneto, Giacomo Boracchi
Abstract: Accurate and computationally light algorithms for estimating the State of Charge (SoC) of a battery's cells are crucial for effective battery management on embedded systems. In this letter, we propose an Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter (AEKF) for SoC estimation using a covariance adaptation technique based on maximum likelihood estimation - a novelty in this domain. Furthermore, we tune a key design parameter - the window size - to obtain an optimal memory-performance trade-off, and experimentally demonstrate our solution achieves superior estimation accuracy with respect to existing alternative methods. Finally, we present a fully custom implementation of the AEKF for a general-purpose low-cost STM32 microcontroller, showing it can be deployed with minimal computational requirements adequate for real-world usage.

Title: InstructMPC: A Human-LLM-in-the-Loop Framework for Context-Aware Control
Authors: Ruixiang Wu, Jiahao Ai, Tongxin Li
Abstract: Model Predictive Control~(MPC) is a powerful control strategy widely utilized in domains like energy management, building control, and autonomous systems. However, its effectiveness in real-world settings is challenged by the need to incorporate context-specific predictions and expert instructions, which traditional MPC often neglects. We propose \IMPC, a novel framework that addresses this gap by integrating real-time human instructions through a Large Language Model~(LLM) to produce context-aware predictions for MPC. Our method employs a Language-to-Distribution~(L2D) module to translate contextual information into predictive disturbance trajectories, which are then incorporated into the MPC optimization. Unlike existing context-aware and language-based MPC models, \IMPC enables dynamic human-LLM interaction and fine-tunes the L2D module in a closed loop with theoretical performance guarantees, achieving a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T\log T})$ for linear dynamics when optimized via advanced fine-tuning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization~(DPO) using a tailored loss function.

Title: Control-Oriented Modelling and Adaptive Parameter Estimation for Hybrid Wind-Wave Energy Systems
Authors: Yingbo Huang, Bozhong Yuan, Haoran He, Jing Na, Yu Feng, Guang Li, Jing Zhao, Pak Kin Wong, Lin Cui
Abstract: Hybrid wind-wave energy system, integrating floating offshore wind turbine and wave energy converters, has received much attention in recent years due to its potential benefit in increasing the power harvest density and reducing the levelized cost of electricity. Apart from the design complexities of the hybrid wind-wave energy systems, their energy conversion efficiency, power output smoothness and their safe operations introduce new challenges for their control system designs. Recent studies show that advanced model-based control strategies have the great potential to significantly improve their overall control performance. However the performance of these advanced control strategies rely on the computationally efficient control-oriented models with sufficient fidelity, which are normally difficult to derive due to the complexity of the hydro-, aero-dynamic effects and the this http URL most available results, the hybrid wind-wave energy system models are established by using the Boundary Element Method, devoting to understanding the hydrodynamic responses and performance analysis. However, such models are complex and involved relatively heavy computational burden, which cannot be directly used for the advanced model-based control methods that are essential for improving power capture efficiency from implementing in practice. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a control-oriented model of the hybrid windwave energy system with six degrees of freedom. First, ...

Title: Fair Resource Allocation in UAV-based Semantic Communication System with Fluid Antenna
Authors: Liang Siyun, Chen Zhu, Zhaohui Yang, Changsheng You, Dusit Niyato, Kai-Kit Wong, Zhaoyang Zhang
Abstract: In this paper, the problem of maximization of the minimum equivalent rate in a unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV)-based multi-user semantic communication system is investigated. In the considered model, a multi-antenna UAV employs semantic extraction techniques to compress the data ready to be sent to the users, which are equipped with fluid antennas. Our aim is to jointly optimize the trajectory of the UAV, the transmit beamforming and the semantic compression rate at the UAV, as well as the selection of activated ports in fluid antenna system (FAS), to maximize the minimum equivalent transmission rate among all user. An alternating algorithm is designed to solve the problem. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Title: Hybrid Control as a Proxy for Detection and Mitigation of Sensor Attacks in Cooperative Driving
Authors: Mischa Huisman, Carlos Murguia, Erjen Lefeber, Nathan van de Wouw
Abstract: To enhance the robustness of cooperative driving against cyberattacks, we propose a hybrid controller scheme to detect and mitigate False-Data Injection (FDI) attacks in real-time. The core of our method builds on a given Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) algorithm and exploits sensor redundancy to construct equivalent controllers, each driven by a distinct, non-overlapping subset of sensors (equivalent controller realizations). By construction, these controller realizations generate the same control input in the absence of an attack, allowing us to devise an algorithm that compares control signals and measurements to pinpoint anomalous behavior via a majority vote. This allows us to: 1) decide in real-time which subset of sensors is compromised; and 2) switch to a healthy subset, mitigating thus sensor FDI attacks. We model the latter logic as a hybrid dynamic controller that decides in real-time what realization to use, builds on attack-dependent flow and jump sets, and employs controller resets (to return the state of previously compromised controller realizations to a correct value after the attack stops). We demonstrate the performance of our scheme through simulation experiments.

Title: OSDM-MReg: Multimodal Image Registration based One Step Diffusion Model
Authors: Xiaochen Wei, Weiwei Guo, Wenxian Yu, Feiming Wei, Dongying Li
Abstract: Multimodal remote sensing image registration aligns images from different sensors for data fusion and analysis. However, current methods often fail to extract modality-invariant features when aligning image pairs with large nonlinear radiometric differences. To address this issues, we propose OSDM-MReg, a novel multimodal image registration framework based image-to-image translation to eliminate the gap of multimodal images. Firstly, we propose a novel one-step unaligned target-guided conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models(UTGOS-CDDPM)to translate multimodal images into a unified domain. In the inference stage, traditional conditional DDPM generate translated source image by a large number of iterations, which severely slows down the image registration task. To address this issues, we use the unaligned traget image as a condition to promote the generation of low-frequency features of the translated source image. Furthermore, during the training stage, we add the inverse process of directly predicting the translated image to ensure that the translated source image can be generated in one step during the testing stage. Additionally, to supervised the detail features of translated source image, we propose a new perceptual loss that focuses on the high-frequency feature differences between the translated and ground-truth images. Finally, a multimodal multiscale image registration network (MM-Reg) fuse the multimodal feature of the unimodal images and multimodal images by proposed multimodal feature fusion strategy. Experiments demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency across various multimodal registration tasks, particularly for SAR-optical image pairs.

Title: Unimodular Waveform Design that Minimizes PSL of Ambiguity Function over A Continuous Doppler Frequency Shift Region of Interest
Authors: Weiting Lin, Yuwei Chang, Borching Su
Abstract: In active sensing systems, waveforms with ambiguity functions (AFs) of low peak sidelobe levels (PSLs) across a time delay and Doppler frequency shift plane (delay-Doppler plane) of interest are desirable for reducing false alarms. Additionally, unimodular waveforms are preferred due to hardware limitations. In this paper, a new method is proposed to design unimodular waveforms with PSL suppression over a continuous Doppler frequency shift region, based on the discrete-time ambiguity function (DTAF). Compared with existing methods that suppress PSL over grid points in the delay-Doppler plane by using the discrete ambiguity function (DAF), we regard the DTAF optimization problem as of more practical interest because the Doppler frequency shifts observed in echo signals reflected from targets are inherently continuous rather than discrete. The problem of interest is formulated as an optimization problem with infinite constraints along with unimodular constraints. To the best of the authors' knowledge, such a problem has not been studied yet. We propose to reformulate a non-convex semi-infinite programming (SIP) to a semidefinite programming (SDP) with a finite number of constraints and a rank-one constraint, which is then solved by the sequential rank-one constraint relaxation (SROCR) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in achieving a lower PSL of AF over a continuous Doppler frequency shift region of interest. Moreover, the designed waveform can effectively prevent false alarms when detecting a target with an arbitrary velocity.

Abstract: Neuromorphic engineering is an emerging research domain that aims to realize important implementation advantages that brain-inspired technologies can offer over classical digital technologies, including energy efficiency, adaptability, and robustness. For the field of systems and control, neuromorphic controllers could potentially bring many benefits, but their advancement is hampered by lack of systematic analysis and design tools. In this paper, the objective is to show that hybrid systems methods can aid in filling this gap. We do this by formally analyzing rhythmic neuromorphic control of a pendulum system, which was recently proposed as a prototypical setup. The neuromorphic controller generates spikes, which we model as a Dirac delta pulse, whenever the pendulum angular position crosses its resting position, with the goal of inducing a stable limit cycle. This leads to modeling the closed-loop system as a hybrid dynamical system, which in between spikes evolves in open loop and where the jumps correspond to the spiking control actions. Exploiting the hybrid system model, we formally prove the existence, uniqueness, and a stability property of the hybrid limit cycle for the closed-loop system. Numerical simulations illustrate our approach. We finally elaborate on a possible spiking adaptation mechanism on the pulse amplitude to generate a hybrid limit cycle of a desired maximal angular amplitude.

Title: Low-Complexity SDP-ADMM for Physical-Layer Multicasting in Massive MIMO Systems
Authors: Mahmoud Zaher, Emil Björnson
Abstract: There is a demand for the same data content from several user equipments (UEs) in many wireless communication applications. Physical-layer multicasting combines the beamforming capability of massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) and the broadcast nature of the wireless channel to efficiently deliver the same data to a group of UEs using a single transmission. This paper tackles the max-min fair (MMF) multicast beamforming optimization, which is an NP-hard problem. We develop an efficient semidefinite program-alternating direction method of multipliers (SDP-ADMM) algorithm to find the near-global optimal rank-1 solution to the MMF multicast problem in a massive MIMO system. Numerical results show that the proposed SDP-ADMM algorithm exhibits similar spectral efficiency performance to state-of-the-art algorithms running on standard SDP solvers at a vastly reduced computational complexity. We highlight that the proposed ADMM elimination procedure can be employed as an effective low-complexity rank reduction method for other problems utilizing semidefinite relaxation.

Authors: Alba Gurpegui, Mark Jeeninga, Emma Tegling, Anders Rantzer
Abstract: This paper addresses the positive synchronization of interconnected systems on undirected graphs. For homogeneous positive systems, a static feedback protocol design is proposed, based on the Linear Regulator problem. The solution to the algebraic equation associated to the stabilizing policy can be found using a linear program. Necessary and sufficient conditions on the positivity of each agent's trajectory for all nonnegative initial conditions are also provided. Simulations on large regular graphs with different nodal degree illustrate the proposed results.

Title: Plug and Play Distributed Control of Clustered Energy Hub Networks
Authors: Varsha Behrunani, Cara Koepele, Jared Miller, Ahmed Aboudonia, Philipp Heer, Roy S. Smith, John Lygeros
Abstract: The transition to renewable energy is driving the rise of distributed multi-energy systems, in which individual energy hubs and prosumers (e.g., homes, industrial campuses) generate, store, and trade energy. Economic Model Predictive Control (MPC) schemes are widely used to optimize operation of energy hubs by efficiently dispatching resources and minimizing costs while ensuring operational constraints are met. Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading among hubs enhances network efficiency and reduces costs but also increases computational and privacy challenges, especially as the network scales. Additionally, current distributed control techniques require global recomputation whenever the network topology changes, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we propose a clustering-based P2P trading framework that enables plug-and-play operation, allowing energy hubs to seamlessly join or leave without requiring network-wide controller updates. The impact is restricted to the hubs within the affected cluster. The energy trading problem is formulated as a bi-level bargaining game, where inter-cluster trading commitments are determined at the cluster level, while energy dispatch and cost-sharing among hubs within a cluster are refined at the hub level. Both levels are solved in a distributed manner using ADMM, ensuring computational feasibility and privacy preservation. Moreover, we develop plug-and-play procedures to handle dynamic topology changes at both the hub and cluster levels, minimizing disruptions across the network. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed bi-level framework reduces operational costs, and enables scalable energy management under plug-and-play operation.

Title: Addressing Relative Degree Issues in Control Barrier Function Synthesis with Physics-Informed Neural Networks
Authors: Lukas Brunke, Siqi Zhou, Francesco D'Orazio, Angela P. Schoellig
Abstract: In robotics, control barrier function (CBF)-based safety filters are commonly used to enforce state constraints. A critical challenge arises when the relative degree of the CBF varies across the state space. This variability can create regions within the safe set where the control input becomes unconstrained. When implemented as a safety filter, this may result in chattering near the safety boundary and ultimately compromise system safety. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach for CBF synthesis by formulating it as solving a set of boundary value problems. The solutions to the boundary value problems are determined using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Our approach ensures that the synthesized CBFs maintain a constant relative degree across the set of admissible states, thereby preventing unconstrained control scenarios. We illustrate the approach in simulation and further verify it through real-world quadrotor experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving desired system safety properties.

Title: Exploring Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations for Speech Emotion Recognition with Distribution-Shift
Authors: Maja J. Hjuler, Line H. Clemmensen, Sneha Das
Abstract: We introduce EmoLIME, a version of local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) for black-box Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply LIME in SER. EmoLIME generates high-level interpretable explanations and identifies which specific frequency ranges are most influential in determining emotional states. The approach aids in interpreting complex, high-dimensional embeddings such as those generated by end-to-end speech models. We evaluate EmoLIME, qualitatively, quantitatively, and statistically, across three emotional speech datasets, using classifiers trained on both hand-crafted acoustic features and Wav2Vec 2.0 embeddings. We find that EmoLIME exhibits stronger robustness across different models than across datasets with distribution shifts, highlighting its potential for more consistent explanations in SER tasks within a dataset.

Title: Status Updating with Time Stamp Errors
Authors: Md Nurul Absar Siddiky, Ahmed Arafa
Abstract: A status updating system is considered in which multiple processes are sampled and transmitted through a shared channel. Each process has its dedicated server that processes its samples before time stamping them for transmission. Time stamps, however, are prone to errors, and hence the status updates received may not be credible. Our setting models the time stamp error rate as a function of the servers' busy times. Hence, to reduce errors and enhance credibility, servers need to process samples on a relatively prolonged schedule. This, however, deteriorates timeliness, which is captured through the age of information (AoI) metric. An optimization problem is formulated whose goal to characterize the optimal processes' schedule and sampling instances to achieve the optimal trade-off between timeliness and credibility. The problem is first solved for a single process setting, where it is shown that a threshold-based sleep-wake schedule is optimal, in which the server wakes up and is allowed to process newly incoming samples only if the AoI surpasses a certain threshold that depends on the required timeliness-credibility trade-off. Such insights are then extended to the multi-process setting, where two main scheduling and sleep-wake policies, namely round-robin scheduling with threshold-waiting and asymmetric scheduling with zero-waiting, are introduced and analyzed.

Title: Towards Zero Trust Security in Connected Vehicles: A Comprehensive Survey
Authors: Malak Annabi, Abdelhafid Zeroual, Nadhir Messai
Abstract: Zero Trust is the new cybersecurity model that challenges the traditional one by promoting continuous verification of users, devices, and applications, whatever their position or origin. This model is critical for reducing the attack surface and preventing lateral movement without relying on implicit trust. Adopting the zero trust principle in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), especially in the context of connected vehicles (CVs), presents an adequate solution in the face of increasing cyber threats, thereby strengthening the ITS environment. This paper offers an understanding of Zero Trust security through a comprehensive review of existing literature, principles, and challenges. It specifically examines its applications in emerging technologies, particularly within connected vehicles, addressing potential issues and cyber threats faced by CVs. Inclusion/exclusion criteria for the systematic literature review were planned alongside a bibliometric analysis. Moreover, keyword co-occurrence analysis was done, which indicates trends and general themes for the Zero Trust model, Zero Trust implementation, and Zero Trust application. Furthermore, the paper explores various ZT models proposed in the literature for connected vehicles, shedding light on the challenges associated with their integration into CV systems. Future directions of this research will focus on incorporating Zero Trust principles within Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication paradigms. This initiative intends to enhance the security posture and safety protocols within interconnected vehicular networks. The proposed research seeks to address the unique cybersecurity vulnerabilities inherent in the highly dynamic nature of vehicular communication systems.

Title: Optimal Bayesian Affine Estimator and Active Learning for the Wiener Model
Authors: Sasan Vakili, Manuel Mazo Jr., Peyman Mohajerin Esfahani
Abstract: This paper presents a Bayesian estimation framework for Wiener models, focusing on learning nonlinear output functions under known linear state dynamics. We derive a closed-form optimal affine estimator for the unknown parameters, characterized by the so-called "dynamic basis statistics (DBS)." Several features of the proposed estimator are studied, including Bayesian unbiasedness, closed-form posterior statistics, error monotonicity in trajectory length, and consistency condition (also known as persistent excitation). In the special case of Fourier basis functions, we demonstrate that the closed-form description is computationally available, as the Fourier DBS enjoys explicit expression. Furthermore, we identify an inherent inconsistency in single-trajectory measurements, regardless of input excitation. Leveraging the closed-form estimation error, we develop an active learning algorithm synthesizing input signals to minimize estimation error. Numerical experiments validate the efficacy of our approach, showing significant improvements over traditional regularized least-squares methods.

Title: Neural network-enhanced integrators for simulating ordinary differential equations
Authors: Amine Othmane, Kathrin Flaßkamp
Abstract: Numerous applications necessitate the computation of numerical solutions to differential equations across a wide range of initial conditions and system parameters, which feeds the demand for efficient yet accurate numerical integration this http URL study proposes a neural network (NN) enhancement of classical numerical integrators. NNs are trained to learn integration errors, which are then used as additive correction terms in numerical schemes. The performance of these enhanced integrators is compared with well-established methods through numerical studies, with a particular emphasis on computational efficiency. Analytical properties are examined in terms of local errors and backward error analysis. Embedded Runge-Kutta schemes are then employed to develop enhanced integrators that mitigate generalization risk, ensuring that the neural network's evaluation in previously unseen regions of the state space does not destabilize the integrator. It is guaranteed that the enhanced integrators perform at least as well as the desired classical Runge-Kutta schemes. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is demonstrated through extensive numerical studies using a realistic model of a wind turbine, with parameters derived from the established simulation framework OpenFast.

Authors: Juan Giribet, Alejandro Ghersin, Ignacio Mas
Abstract: A dual quaternion-based control strategy for formation flying of small UAV groups is proposed. Through the definition of a virtual structure, the coordinated control of formation's position, orientation, and shape parameters is enabled. This abstraction simplifies formation management, allowing a low-level controller to compute commands for individual UAVs. The controller is divided into a pose control module and a geometry-based adaptive strategy, providing efficient and precise task execution. Simulation and experimental results validate the approach.

Title: Robust and Efficient Average Consensus with Non-Coherent Over-the-Air Aggregation
Authors: Yuhang Deng, Zheng Chen, Erik G. Larsson
Abstract: Non-coherent over-the-air (OTA) computation has garnered increasing attention for its advantages in facilitating information aggregation among distributed agents in resource-constrained networks without requiring precise channel estimation. A promising application scenario of this method is distributed average consensus in wireless multi-agent systems. However, in such scenario, non-coherent interference from concurrent OTA transmissions can introduce bias in the consensus value. To address this issue, we develop a robust distributed average consensus algorithm by formulating the consensus problem as a distributed optimization problem. Using decentralized projected gradient descent (D-PGD), our proposed algorithm can achieve unbiased mean square average consensus even in the presence of non-coherent interference and noise. Additionally, we implement transmit power control and receive scaling mechanisms to further accelerate convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that our method can significantly enhance the convergence speed of the D-PGD algorithm for OTA average consensus without compromising accuracy.

Title: Low-Complexity AoI-Optimal Status Update Control with Partial Battery State Information in Energy Harvesting IoT Networks
Authors: Hao Wu, Shengtian Yang, Jun Chen, Chao Chen, Anding Wang
Abstract: For a two-hop IoT system consisting of multiple energy harvesting sensors, a cache-enabled edge node, and multiple monitors, the status update control at the edge node, which has partial battery state information (pBSI) of the sensors, is formulated as a pBSI problem. The concept of inferred pBSI is introduced to reduce the noiseless single-sensor pBSI problem to a Markov decision process with a moderate state-space size, enabling the optimal policy to be obtained through a value iteration algorithm. A lower bound on the expected time-average on-demand age of information performance is established for the general single-sensor status update problem. For the single-sensor pBSI problem, a semi-closed-form policy called the current-next (CN) policy is proposed, along with an efficient post-update value iteration algorithm with a per-iteration time complexity proportional to the square of the battery capacity. A weighted-update-gain-competition (WUGC) approach is further leveraged to extend the CN policy to the multi-sensor case. Numerical results in the single-sensor case demonstrate the near-optimal performance of the CN policy across various energy arrival processes. Simulations for an IoT system with $100$ sensors reveal that the WUGC-CN policy outperforms the maximum-age-first policy and the random-scheduling-based CN policy under Bernoulli energy arrival processes.

Title: Réduire le bruit grâce à la réalité augmentée sonore -- Auditory Concealer
Authors: Clara Boukhemia
Abstract: This report presents the work done over 22 weeks of internship within the Sound Perception and Design team of the Sciences and Technologies of Music and Sound (STMS) laboratory at the Institute for Research and Coordination in Acoustics/Music (IRCAM). As part of the launch of the project Reducing Noise with Augmented Reality (ReNAR); which aims to create a tool to reduce in real-time the cognitive impact of sounds perceived as unpleasant or annoying in indoor environments; an initial study was conducted to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of a new masking approach called concealer. The main hypothesis is that the concealer approach could provide better results than a masker approach in terms of perceived pleasantness. Mixtures of two noise sources (ventilation) and five masking sounds (water sounds) were generated using both approaches at various levels. The evaluation of the perceived pleasantness of these mixtures showed that the masker approach remains more effective than the concealer approach, regardless of the noise source, water sound, or level used.

Title: Jointly-optimized Trajectory Generation and Camera Control for 3D Coverage Planning
Authors: Savvas Papaioannou, Panayiotis Kolios, Theocharis Theocharides, Christos G. Panayiotou, Marios M. Polycarpou
Abstract: This work proposes a jointly optimized trajectory generation and camera control approach, enabling an autonomous agent, such as an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operating in 3D environments, to plan and execute coverage trajectories that maximally cover the surface area of a 3D object of interest. Specifically, the UAV's kinematic and camera control inputs are jointly optimized over a rolling planning horizon to achieve complete 3D coverage of the object. The proposed controller incorporates ray-tracing into the planning process to simulate the propagation of light rays, thereby determining the visible parts of the object through the UAV's camera. This integration enables the generation of precise look-ahead coverage trajectories. The coverage planning problem is formulated as a rolling finite-horizon optimal control problem and solved using mixed-integer programming techniques. Extensive real-world and synthetic experiments validate the performance of the proposed approach.

Title: Matched Topological Subspace Detector
Authors: Chengen Liu, Victor M. Tenorio, Antonio G. Marques, Elvin Isufi
Abstract: Topological spaces, represented by simplicial complexes, capture richer relationships than graphs by modeling interactions not only between nodes but also among higher-order entities, such as edges or triangles. This motivates the representation of information defined in irregular domains as topological signals. By leveraging the spectral dualities of Hodge and Dirac theory, practical topological signals often concentrate in specific spectral subspaces (e.g., gradient or curl). For instance, in a foreign currency exchange network, the exchange flow signals typically satisfy the arbitrage-free condition and hence are curl-free. However, the presence of anomalies can disrupt these conditions, causing the signals to deviate from such subspaces. In this work, we formulate a hypothesis testing framework to detect whether simplicial complex signals lie in specific subspaces in a principled and tractable manner. Concretely, we propose Neyman-Pearson matched topological subspace detectors for signals defined at a single simplicial level (such as edges) or jointly across all levels of a simplicial complex. The (energy-based projection) proposed detectors handle missing values, provide closed-form performance analysis, and effectively capture the unique topological properties of the data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed topological detectors on various real-world data, including foreign currency exchange networks.

Title: Orthogonal Matching Pursuit based Reconstruction for Modulo Hysteresis Operators
Authors: Matthias Beckmann, Jürgen Jeschke
Abstract: Unlimited sampling provides an acquisition scheme for high dynamic range signals by folding the signal into the dynamic range of the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) using modulo non-linearity prior to sampling to prevent saturation. Recently, a generalized scheme called modulo hysteresis was introduced to account for hardware non-idealities. The encoding operator, however, does not guarantee that the output signal is within the dynamic range of the ADC. To resolve this, we propose a modified modulo hysteresis operator and show identifiability of bandlimited signals from modulo hysteresis samples. We propose a recovery algorithm based on orthogonal matching pursuit and validate our theoretical results through numerical experiments.

Title: Collision-free landing of multiple UAVs on moving ground vehicles using time-varying control barrier functions
Authors: Viswa Narayanan Sankaranarayanan, Akshit Saradagi, Sumeet Satpute, George Nikolakopoulos
Abstract: In this article, we present a centralized approach for the control of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for landing on moving unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) using control barrier functions (CBFs). The proposed control framework employs two kinds of CBFs to impose safety constraints on the UAVs' motion. The first class of CBFs (LCBF) is a three-dimensional exponentially decaying function centered above the landing platform, designed to safely and precisely land UAVs on the UGVs. The second set is a spherical CBF (SCBF), defined between every pair of UAVs, which avoids collisions between them. The LCBF is time-varying and adapts to the motions of the UGVs. In the proposed CBF approach, the control input from the UAV's nominal tracking controller designed to reach the landing platform is filtered to choose a minimally-deviating control input that ensures safety (as defined by the CBFs). As the control inputs of every UAV are shared in establishing multiple CBF constraints, we prove that the control inputs are shared without conflict in rendering the safe sets forward invariant. The performance of the control framework is validated through a simulated scenario involving three UAVs landing on three moving targets.

Title: Self-sustained oscillations in discrete-time relay feedback systems
Authors: Kang Tong, Christian Grussler, Michelle S. Chong
Abstract: We study the problem of determining self-sustained oscillations in discrete-time linear time-invariant relay feedback systems. Concretely, we are interested in predicting when such a system admits unimodal oscillations, i.e., when the output has a single-peaked period. Under the assumption that the linear system is stable and has an impulse response that is strictly monotonically decreasing on its infinite support, we take a novel approach in using the framework of total positivity to address our main question. It is shown that unimodal self-oscillations can only exist if the number of positive and negative elements in a period coincides. Based on this result, we derive conditions for the existence of such oscillations, determine bounds on their periods, and address the question of uniqueness.

Title: A Corrector-aided Look-ahead Distance-based Guidance for Reference Path Following with an Efficient Midcourse Guidance Strategy
Authors: Reva Dhillon, Agni Ravi Deepa, Hrishav Das, Subham Basak, Satadal Ghosh
Abstract: Efficient path-following is crucial in most of the applications of autonomous vehicles (UxV). Among various guidance strategies presented in literature, look-ahead distance ($L_1$)-based guidance method has received significant attention due to its ease in implementation and ability to maintain a low cross-track error while following simpler reference paths and generate bounded lateral acceleration commands. However, the constant value of $L_1$ becomes problematic when the UxV is far away from the reference path and also produce higher cross-track error while following complex reference paths having high variation in radius of curvature. To address these challenges, the notion of look-ahead distance is leveraged in a novel way to develop a two-phase guidance strategy. Initially, when the UxV is far from the reference path, an optimized $L_1$ selection strategy is developed to guide the UxV toward the reference path in order to maintain minimal lateral acceleration command. Once the vehicle reaches a close vicinity of the reference path, a novel notion of corrector point is incorporated in the constant $L_1$-based guidance scheme to generate the lateral acceleration command that effectively reduces the root mean square of the cross-track error thereafter. Simulation results demonstrate that this proposed corrector point and look-ahead point pair-based guidance strategy along with the developed midcourse guidance scheme outperforms the conventional constant $L_1$ guidance scheme both in terms of feasibility and measures of effectiveness like cross-track error and lateral acceleration requirements.

Title: Smart Exploration in Reinforcement Learning using Bounded Uncertainty Models
Authors: J.S. van Hulst, W.P.M.H. Heemels, D.J. Antunes
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful tool for decision-making in uncertain environments, but it often requires large amounts of data to learn an optimal policy. We propose using prior model knowledge to guide the exploration process to speed up this learning process. This model knowledge comes in the form of a model set to which the true transition kernel and reward function belong. We optimize over this model set to obtain upper and lower bounds on the Q-function, which are then used to guide the exploration of the agent. We provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of the Q-function to the optimal Q-function under the proposed class of exploring policies. Furthermore, we also introduce a data-driven regularized version of the model set optimization problem that ensures the convergence of the class of exploring policies to the optimal policy. Lastly, we show that when the model set has a specific structure, namely the bounded-parameter MDP (BMDP) framework, the regularized model set optimization problem becomes convex and simple to implement. In this setting, we also show that we obtain finite-time convergence to the optimal policy under additional assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed exploration strategy in a simulation study. The results indicate that the proposed method can significantly speed up the learning process in reinforcement learning.

Title: Linear time-and-space-invariant relaxation systems
Authors: Tihol Ivanov Donchev, Brayan M. Shali, Rodolphe Sepulchre
Abstract: This paper generalizes the physical property of relaxation from linear time-invariant (LTI) to linear time-and-space-invariant (LTSI) systems. It is shown that the defining features of relaxation -- complete monotonicity, passivity, and memory-based storage -- carry over seamlessly to the spatio-temporal domain. An LTSI system is shown to be of relaxation type if and only if its associated spatio-temporal Hankel operator is cyclically monotone. This implies the existence of an intrinsic quadratic storage functional defined uniquely by past inputs, independently of any state-space realization. As in the LTI case, LTSI relaxation systems are shown to be those systems for which the state-space concept of storage coincides with the input-output concept of fading memory functional.

Title: Robo-taxi Fleet Coordination at Scale via Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Luigi Tresca, Carolin Schmidt, James Harrison, Filipe Rodrigues, Gioele Zardini, Daniele Gammelli, Marco Pavone
Abstract: Fleets of robo-taxis offering on-demand transportation services, commonly known as Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) systems, hold significant promise for societal benefits, such as reducing pollution, energy consumption, and urban congestion. However, orchestrating these systems at scale remains a critical challenge, with existing coordination algorithms often failing to exploit the systems' full potential. This work introduces a novel decision-making framework that unites mathematical modeling with data-driven techniques. In particular, we present the AMoD coordination problem through the lens of reinforcement learning and propose a graph network-based framework that exploits the main strengths of graph representation learning, reinforcement learning, and classical operations research tools. Extensive evaluations across diverse simulation fidelities and scenarios demonstrate the flexibility of our approach, achieving superior system performance, computational efficiency, and generalizability compared to prior methods. Finally, motivated by the need to democratize research efforts in this area, we release publicly available benchmarks, datasets, and simulators for network-level coordination alongside an open-source codebase designed to provide accessible simulation platforms and establish a standardized validation process for comparing methodologies.

Title: Multi-Modality Sensing in mmWave Beamforming for Connected Vehicles Using Deep Learning
Authors: Muhammad Baqer Mollah, Honggang Wang, Mohammad Ataul Karim, Hua Fang
Abstract: Beamforming techniques are considered as essential parts to compensate severe path losses in millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications. In particular, these techniques adopt large antenna arrays and formulate narrow beams to obtain satisfactory received powers. However, performing accurate beam alignment over narrow beams for efficient link configuration by traditional standard defined beam selection approaches, which mainly rely on channel state information and beam sweeping through exhaustive searching, imposes computational and communications overheads. And, such resulting overheads limit their potential use in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications involving highly dynamic scenarios. In comparison, utilizing out-of-band contextual information, such as sensing data obtained from sensor devices, provides a better alternative to reduce overheads. This paper presents a deep learning-based solution for utilizing the multi-modality sensing data for predicting the optimal beams having sufficient mmWave received powers so that the best V2I and V2V line-of-sight links can be ensured proactively. The proposed solution has been tested on real-world measured mmWave sensing and communication data, and the results show that it can achieve up to 98.19% accuracies while predicting top-13 beams. Correspondingly, when compared to existing been sweeping approach, the beam sweeping searching space and time overheads are greatly shortened roughly by 79.67% and 91.89%, respectively which confirm a promising solution for beamforming in mmWave enabled communications.

Title: Dictionary-free Koopman Predictive Control for Autonomous Vehicles in Mixed Traffic
Authors: Xu Shang, Zhaojian Li, Yang Zheng
Abstract: Koopman Model Predictive Control (KMPC) and Data-EnablEd Predictive Control (DeePC) use linear models to approximate nonlinear systems and integrate them with predictive control. Both approaches have recently demonstrated promising performance in controlling Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic. However, selecting appropriate lifting functions for the Koopman operator in KMPC is challenging, while the data-driven representation from Willems' fundamental lemma in DeePC must be updated to approximate the local linearization when the equilibrium traffic state changes. In this paper, we propose a dictionary-free Koopman model predictive control (DF-KMPC) for CAV control. In particular, we first introduce a behavioral perspective to identify the optimal dictionary-free Koopman linear model. We then utilize an iterative algorithm to compute a data-driven approximation of the dictionary-free Koopman representation. Integrating this data-driven linear representation with predictive control leads to our DF-KMPC, which eliminates the need to select lifting functions and update the traffic equilibrium state. Nonlinear traffic simulations show that DF-KMPC effectively mitigates traffic waves and improves tracking performance.

Title: Streaming Heteroscedastic Probabilistic PCA with Missing Data
Authors: Kyle Gilman, David Hong, Jeffrey A. Fessler, Laura Balzano
Abstract: Streaming principal component analysis (PCA) is an integral tool in large-scale machine learning for rapidly estimating low-dimensional subspaces from very high-dimensional data arriving at a high rate. However, modern datasets increasingly combine data from a variety of sources, and thus may exhibit heterogeneous quality across samples. Standard streaming PCA algorithms do not account for non-uniform noise, so their subspace estimates can quickly degrade. While the recently proposed Heteroscedastic Probabilistic PCA Technique (HePPCAT) addresses this heterogeneity, it was not designed to handle streaming data, which may exhibit non-stationary behavior. Moreover, HePPCAT does not allow for missing entries in the data, which can be common in streaming data. This paper proposes the Streaming HeteroscedASTic Algorithm for PCA (SHASTA-PCA) to bridge this divide. SHASTA-PCA employs a stochastic alternating expectation maximization approach that jointly learns the low-rank latent factors and the unknown noise variances from streaming data that may have missing entries and heteroscedastic noise, all while maintaining a low memory and computational footprint. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior subspace estimation of our method compared to state-of-the-art streaming PCA algorithms in the heteroscedastic setting. Finally, we illustrate SHASTA-PCA applied to highly heterogeneous real data from astronomy.

Title: Unsupervised Denoising for Signal-Dependent and Row-Correlated Imaging Noise
Authors: Benjamin Salmon, Alexander Krull
Abstract: Accurate analysis of microscopy images is hindered by the presence of noise. This noise is usually signal-dependent and often additionally correlated along rows or columns of pixels. Current self- and unsupervised denoisers can address signal-dependent noise, but none can reliably remove noise that is also row- or column-correlated. Here, we present the first fully unsupervised deep learning-based denoiser capable of handling imaging noise that is row-correlated as well as signal-dependent. Our approach uses a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a specially designed autoregressive decoder. This decoder is capable of modeling row-correlated and signal-dependent noise but is incapable of independently modeling underlying clean signal. The VAE therefore produces latent variables containing only clean signal information, and these are mapped back into image space using a proposed second decoder network. Our method does not require a pre-trained noise model and can be trained from scratch using unpaired noisy data. We benchmark our approach on microscopy datatsets from a range of imaging modalities and sensor types, each with row- or column-correlated, signal-dependent noise, and show that it outperforms existing self- and unsupervised denoisers.

Title: An Adaptive Method for Contextual Stochastic Multi-armed Bandits with Rewards Generated by a Linear Dynamical System
Authors: Jonathan Gornet, Mehdi Hosseinzadeh, Bruno Sinopoli
Abstract: Online decision-making can be formulated as the popular stochastic multi-armed bandit problem where a learner makes decisions (or takes actions) to maximize cumulative rewards collected from an unknown environment. This paper proposes to model a stochastic multi-armed bandit as an unknown linear Gaussian dynamical system, as many applications, such as bandits for dynamic pricing problems or hyperparameter selection for machine learning models, can benefit from this perspective. Following this approach, we can build a matrix representation of the system's steady-state Kalman filter that takes a set of previously collected observations from a time interval of length $s$ to predict the next reward that will be returned for each action. This paper proposes a solution in which the parameter $s$ is determined via an adaptive algorithm by analyzing the model uncertainty of the matrix representation. This algorithm helps the learner adaptively adjust its model size and its length of exploration based on the uncertainty of its environmental model. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through extensive numerical studies, revealing that the proposed scheme is capable of increasing the rate of collected cumulative rewards.

Title: Efficient and Accurate Pneumonia Detection Using a Novel Multi-Scale Transformer Approach
Authors: Alireza Saber, Pouria Parhami, Alimohammad Siahkarzadeh, Mansoor Fateh, Amirreza Fateh
Abstract: Pneumonia, a prevalent respiratory infection, remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly among vulnerable populations. Chest X-rays serve as a primary tool for pneumonia detection; however, variations in imaging conditions and subtle visual indicators complicate consistent interpretation. Automated tools can enhance traditional methods by improving diagnostic reliability and supporting clinical decision-making. In this study, we propose a novel multi-scale transformer approach for pneumonia detection that integrates lung segmentation and classification into a unified framework. Our method introduces a lightweight transformer-enhanced TransUNet for precise lung segmentation, achieving a Dice score of 95.68% on the "Chest X-ray Masks and Labels" dataset with fewer parameters than traditional transformers. For classification, we employ pre-trained ResNet models (ResNet-50 and ResNet-101) to extract multi-scale feature maps, which are then processed through a modified transformer module to enhance pneumonia detection. This integration of multi-scale feature extraction and lightweight transformer modules ensures robust performance, making our method suitable for resource-constrained clinical environments. Our approach achieves 93.75% accuracy on the "Kermany" dataset and 96.04% accuracy on the "Cohen" dataset, outperforming existing methods while maintaining computational efficiency. This work demonstrates the potential of multi-scale transformer architectures to improve pneumonia diagnosis, offering a scalable and accurate solution to global healthcare challenges."this https URL

Abstract: Current emotional text-to-speech systems face challenges in conveying the full spectrum of human emotions, largely due to the inherent complexity of human emotions and the limited range of emotional labels in existing speech datasets. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a TTS framework that provides flexible user control over three emotional dimensions - pleasure, arousal, and dominance - enabling the synthesis of a diverse array of emotional styles. The framework leverages an emotional dimension predictor, trained soley on categorical labels from speech data and grounded in earlier psychological research, which is seamlessly integrated into a language model-based TTS system. Experimental results demonstrates that the proposed framework effectively learns emotional styles from expressive speech, eliminating the need for explicit emotion labels during TTS training, while enhancing the naturalness and diversity of synthesized emotional speech.

Title: Designing Unimodular Waveforms for MIMO Radar Based on Manifold Optimization Method
Authors: Xuyang Zhao, Jiangtao Wang, Shihao Yan, Yongchao Wang
Abstract: In this paper, we design unimodular waveforms with good correlation properties for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) radar systems. Specifically, first, we analyze the geometric properties of the unimodular constraint in the fourth-order polynomial minimization problem using Riemannian geometry theory. By embedding it into the search space, we transform the original non-convex optimization problem into an unconstrained problem on a Riemannian manifold. Then, we construct the manifold corresponding to the search space and the operators required for the customized optimization algorithm. Second, we develop a customized low-complexity unimodular manifold gradient descent (UM-GD) algorithm on the constructed manifold to solve the optimization problem in the normal-scale case, and propose its acceleration version unimodular manifold accelerated gradient descent (UM-AGD) algorithm, to speed up the convergence. In the large-scale case, we transform the objective function into the form of a summation of a large but finite number of loss functions and develop a customized unimodular manifold stochastic variance reduced gradient (UM-SVRG) algorithm to solve this problem. Compared to the existing bechmark method, which has a computational complexity of roughly $\mathcal{O}(M^4+3M^2N+3|\mathcal{D}| |\hat{\Theta}|^2MN)$, UM-SVRG algorithm effectively reduces the computational complexity of each iteration to roughly $\mathcal{O}(|\mathcal{D}||\hat{\Theta}|^2MN)$. Thirdly, we provide theoretical guarantees of convergence for both the UM-GD and UM-SVRG algorithms through appropriate parameter selection, and prove that the proposed algorithms can converge to a stationary point. Finally, numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed UM-GD and UM-SVRG algorithms.

Title: Parameter choices in HaarPSI for IQA with medical images
Authors: Clemens Karner, Janek Gröhl, Ian Selby, Judith Babar, Jake Beckford, Thomas R Else, Timothy J Sadler, Shahab Shahipasand, Arthikkaa Thavakumar, Michael Roberts, James H.F. Rudd, Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb, Jonathan R Weir-McCall, Anna Breger
Abstract: When developing machine learning models, image quality assessment (IQA) measures are a crucial component for the evaluation of obtained output images. However, commonly used full-reference IQA (FR-IQA) measures have been primarily developed and optimized for natural images. In many specialized settings, such as medical images, this poses an often overlooked problem regarding suitability. In previous studies, the FR-IQA measure HaarPSI showed promising behavior regarding generalizability. The measure is based on Haar wavelet representations and the framework allows optimization of two parameters. So far, these parameters have been aligned for natural images. Here, we optimize these parameters for two medical image data sets, a photoacoustic and a chest X-ray data set, with IQA expert ratings. We observe that they lead to similar parameter values, different to the natural image data, and are more sensitive to parameter changes. We denote the novel optimized setting as HaarPSI$_{MED}$, which improves the performance of the employed medical images significantly (p<0.05). Additionally, we include an independent CT test data set that illustrates the generalizability of HaarPSI$_{MED}$, as well as visual examples that qualitatively demonstrate the improvement. The results suggest that adapting common IQA measures within their frameworks for medical images can provide a valuable, generalizable addition to employment of more specific task-based measures.

Title: Direct Adaptive Control of Grid-Connected Power Converters via Output-Feedback Data-Enabled Policy Optimization
Authors: Feiran Zhao, Ruohan Leng, Linbin Huang, Huanhai Xin, Keyou You, Florian Dörfler
Abstract: Power electronic converters are becoming the main components of modern power systems due to the increasing integration of renewable energy sources. However, power converters may become unstable when interacting with the complex and time-varying power grid. In this paper, we propose an adaptive data-driven control method to stabilize power converters by using only online input-output data. Our contributions are threefold. First, we reformulate the output-feedback control problem as a state-feedback linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem with a controllable non-minimal state, which can be constructed from past input-output signals. Second, we propose a data-enabled policy optimization (DeePO) method for this non-minimal realization to achieve efficient output-feedback adaptive control. Third, we use high-fidelity simulations to verify that the output-feedback DeePO can effectively stabilize grid-connected power converters and quickly adapt to the changes in the power grid.

Title: Loop Shaping of Hybrid Motion Control with Contact Transition
Authors: Michael Ruderman
Abstract: A standard motion control with feedback of the output displacement cannot handle unforeseen contact with environment without penetrating into the soft, i.e. viscoelastic, materials or even damaging the fragile materials. Robotics and mechatronics with tactile and haptic capabilities, and in particular medical robotics for example, place special demands on the advanced motion control systems that should enable the safe and harmless contact transitions. This paper shows how the basic principles of loop shaping can be easily used to handle sufficiently stiff motion control in such a way that it is extended by sensor-free dynamic reconfiguration upon contact with the environment. A thereupon based hybrid control scheme is proposed. A remarkable feature of the developed approach is that no measurement of the contact force is required and the input signal and the measured output displacement are the only quantities used for design and operation. Experiments on 1-DOF actuator are shown, where the moving tool comes into contact with grapes that are soft and simultaneously penetrable.

Title: Uncertainty Awareness in Wireless Communications and Sensing
Authors: Shixiong Wang, Wei Dai, Jianyong Sun, Zongben Xu, Geoffrey Ye Li
Abstract: Wireless communications and sensing (WCS) establish the backbone of modern information exchange and environment perception. Typical applications range from mobile networks and the Internet of Things to radar and sensor grids. Despite transformative capabilities, wireless systems often face diverse uncertainties in design and operation, such as modeling errors due to incomplete physical knowledge, statistical errors arising from data scarcity, measurement errors caused by sensor imperfections, computational errors owing to resource limitation, and unpredictability of environmental evolution. Once ignored, these uncertainties can lead to severe outcomes, e.g., performance degradation, system untrustworthiness, inefficient resource utilization, and security vulnerabilities. As such, this article reviews mature and emerging architectural, computational, and operational countermeasures, encompassing uncertainty-aware designs of signals and systems (e.g., diversity, adaptivity, modularity), as well as uncertainty-aware modeling and computational frameworks (e.g., risk-informed optimization, robust signal processing, and trustworthy machine learning). Trade-offs to employ these methods, e.g., robustness vs optimality, are also highlighted.

Title: Transfer Learning Strategies for Pathological Foundation Models: A Systematic Evaluation in Brain Tumor Classification
Authors: Ken Enda, Yoshitaka Oda, Zen-ichi Tanei, Kenichi Satoh, Hiroaki Motegi, Terasaka Shunsuke, Shigeru Yamaguchi, Takahiro Ogawa, Wang Lei, Masumi Tsuda, Shinya Tanaka
Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on large-scale pathology datasets have shown promising results across various diagnostic tasks. Here, we present a systematic evaluation of transfer learning strategies for brain tumor classification using these models. We analyzed 254 cases comprising five major tumor types: glioblastoma, astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and metastatic tumors. Comparing state-of-the-art foundation models with conventional approaches, we found that foundation models demonstrated robust classification performance with as few as 10 patches per case, despite the traditional assumption that extensive per-case image sampling is necessary. Furthermore, our evaluation revealed that simple transfer learning strategies like linear probing were sufficient, while fine-tuning often degraded model performance. These findings suggest a paradigm shift from "training encoders on extensive pathological data" to "querying pre-trained encoders with labeled datasets", providing practical implications for implementing AI-assisted diagnosis in clinical pathology.

Title: Impulsive Relative Motion Control with Continuous-Time Constraint Satisfaction for Cislunar Space Missions
Authors: Fabio Spada, Purnanand Elango, Behçet Açıkmeşe
Abstract: Recent investments in cislunar applications open new frontiers for space missions within highly nonlinear dynamical regimes. In this paper, we propose a method based on Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) to loiter around a given target with impulsive actuation while satisfying path constraints continuously over the finite time-horizon, i.e., independently of the number of nodes in which domain is discretized. Location, timing, magnitude, and direction of a fixed number of impulses are optimized in a model predictive framework, exploiting the exact nonlinear dynamics of non-stationary orbital regimes. The proposed approach is first validated on a relative orbiting problem with respect to a selenocentric near rectilinear halo orbit. The approach is then compared to a formulation with path constraints imposed only at nodes and with mesh refined to ensure complete satisfaction of path constraints over the continuous-time horizon. CPU time per iteration of 400 ms for the refined-mesh approach reduce to 5.5 ms for the proposed approach.

Title: A Deep Neural Network-based Frequency Predictor for Frequency-Constrained Optimal Power Flow
Authors: Fan Jiang, Xingpeng Li, Pascal Van Hentenryck
Abstract: Rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) and frequency nadir should be considered in real-time frequency-constrained optimal power flow (FCOPF) to ensure frequency stability of the modern power systems. Since calculating the frequency response is complex, deep neural network (DNN) could be adopted to capture the nonlinearities and estimate those two metrics accurately. Therefore, in this paper, a DNN-based frequency predictor is developed with the training data obtained from time-domain simulations using PSCAD/EMTDC. Subsequently, it is reformulated using a set of mixed-integer linear programming formulations and then embedded into the FCOPF framework as constraints to ensure grid frequency stability, creating the proposed DNN-FCOPF model. Two benchmark models, a traditional OPF without any frequency constraints and a linear system-wide RoCoF-constrained FCOPF, are also implemented to gauge the proposed DNN-FCOPF. Finally, the solutions obtained with these three models are compared and evaluated with time-domain simulations using PSCAD under various load profiles, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed DNN-FCOPF.

Title: FNSE-SBGAN: Far-field Speech Enhancement with Schrodinger Bridge and Generative Adversarial Networks
Authors: Tong Lei, Qinwen Hu, Ziyao Lin, Andong Li, Rilin Chen, Meng Yu, Dong Yu, Jing Lu
Abstract: The prevailing method for neural speech enhancement predominantly utilizes fully-supervised deep learning with simulated pairs of far-field noisy-reverberant speech and clean speech. Nonetheless, these models frequently demonstrate restricted generalizability to mixtures recorded in real-world conditions. To address this issue, this study investigates training enhancement models directly on real mixtures. Specifically, we revisit the single-channel far-field to near-field speech enhancement (FNSE) task, focusing on real-world data characterized by low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), high reverberation, and mid-to-high frequency attenuation. We propose FNSE-SBGAN, a novel framework that integrates a Schrodinger Bridge (SB)-based diffusion model with generative adversarial networks (GANs). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics and subjective evaluations, significantly reducing the character error rate (CER) by up to 14.58% compared to far-field signals. Experimental results demonstrate that FNSE-SBGAN preserves superior subjective quality and establishes a new benchmark for real-world far-field speech enhancement. Additionally, we introduce a novel evaluation framework leveraging matrix rank analysis in the time-frequency domain, providing systematic insights into model performance and revealing the strengths and weaknesses of different generative methods.

Title: Convergence Theory of Flexible ALADIN for Distributed Optimization
Authors: Xu Du, Xiaohua Zhou, Shijie Zhu
Abstract: The Augmented Lagrangian Alternating Direction Inexact Newton (ALADIN) method is a cutting-edge distributed optimization algorithm known for its superior numerical performance. It relies on each agent transmitting information to a central coordinator for data exchange. However, in practical network optimization and federated learning, unreliable information transmission often leads to packet loss, posing challenges for the convergence analysis of ALADIN. To address this issue, this paper proposes Flexible ALADIN, a random polling variant of ALADIN, and presents a rigorous convergence analysis, including global convergence for convex problems and local convergence for non-convex problems.

Title: Real-time Tracking System with Partially Coupled Sources
Authors: Saeid Sadeghi Vilni, Risto Wichman
Abstract: We consider a pull-based real-time tracking system consisting of multiple partially coupled sources and a sink. The sink monitors the sources in real-time and can request one source for an update at each time instant. The sources send updates over an unreliable wireless channel. The sources are partially coupled, and updates about one source can provide partial knowledge about other sources. We study the problem of minimizing the sum of an average distortion function and a transmission cost. Since the controller is at the sink side, the controller (sink) has only partial knowledge about the source states, and thus, we model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and then cast it as a belief-MDP problem. Using the relative value iteration algorithm, we solve the problem and propose a control policy. Simulation results show the proposed policy's effectiveness and superiority compared to a baseline policy.

Title: A robot-assisted pipeline to rapidly scan 1.7 million historical aerial photographs
Authors: Sheila Masson, Alan Potts, Allan Williams, Steve Berggreen, Kevin McLaren, Sam Martin, Eugenio Noda, Nicklas Nordfors, Nic Ruecroft, Hannah Druckenmiller, Solomon Hsiang, Andreas Madestam, Anna Tompsett
Abstract: During the 20th Century, aerial surveys captured hundreds of millions of high-resolution photographs of the earth's surface. These images, the precursors to modern satellite imagery, represent an extraordinary visual record of the environmental and social upheavals of the 20th Century. However, most of these images currently languish in physical archives where retrieval is difficult and costly. Digitization could revolutionize access, but manual scanning is slow and expensive. Here, we describe and validate a novel robot-assisted pipeline that increases worker productivity in scanning 30-fold, applied at scale to digitize an archive of 1.7 million historical aerial photographs from 65 countries.

Title: Prescribed-Time Boresight Control of Spacecraft Under Pointing Constraints
Authors: Xiaodong Shao, Haoyang Yang, Haoran Li, Zongyu Zuo, Jose Guadalupe Romero, Qinglei Hu
Abstract: This article proposes an integrated boresight guidance and control (IBGC) scheme to address the boresight reorientation problem of spacecraft under temporal and pointing constraints. A $C^1$ continuous, saturated prescribed-time adjustment (PPTA) function is presented, along with the establishment of a practical prescribed-time stability theorem. Utilizing the time scale transformation technique and the PPTA function, we propose a prescribed-time guidance law that guides the boresight vector from almost any initial orientation in free space to a small neighborhood of the goal orientation within a preassigned time, while avoiding all forbidden zones augmented with safety margins. Subsequently, a prescribed-time disturbance observer (PTDO) is derived to reconstruct the external disturbances. By leveraging barrier and PPTA functions, a PTDO-based reduced-attitude tracking controller is developed, which ensures prescribed-time boresight tracking within a ``safe tube''. By judiciously setting the safety margins, settling times, and safe tube for the guidance and control laws, the proposed IBGC scheme achieves pointing-constrained boresight reorientation within a required task completion time. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed IBGC scheme.

Title: Vision Transformers with Autoencoders and Explainable AI for Cancer Patient Risk Stratification Using Whole Slide Imaging
Authors: Ahmad Hussein, Mukesh Prasad, Ali Anaissi, Ali Braytee
Abstract: Cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, necessitating accurate diagnosis and prognosis. Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) has become an integral part of clinical workflows with advancements in digital pathology. While various studies have utilized WSIs, their extracted features may not fully capture the most relevant pathological information, and their lack of interpretability limits clinical adoption. In this paper, we propose PATH-X, a framework that integrates Vision Transformers (ViT) and Autoencoders with SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) to enhance model explainability for patient stratification and risk prediction using WSIs from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A representative image slice is selected from each WSI, and numerical feature embeddings are extracted using Google's pre-trained ViT. These features are then compressed via an autoencoder and used for unsupervised clustering and classification tasks. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis is applied to evaluate stratification into two and three risk groups. SHAP is used to identify key contributing features, which are mapped onto histopathological slices to provide spatial context. PATH-X demonstrates strong performance in breast and glioma cancers, where a sufficient number of WSIs enabled robust stratification. However, performance in lung cancer was limited due to data availability, emphasizing the need for larger datasets to enhance model reliability and clinical applicability.

Title: A Semidefinite Relaxation for Sums of Heterogeneous Quadratic Forms on the Stiefel Manifold
Authors: Kyle Gilman, Sam Burer, Laura Balzano
Abstract: We study the maximization of sums of heterogeneous quadratic forms over the Stiefel manifold, a nonconvex problem that arises in several modern signal processing and machine learning applications such as heteroscedastic probabilistic principal component analysis (HPPCA). In this work, we derive a novel semidefinite program (SDP) relaxation of the original problem and study a few of its theoretical properties. We prove a global optimality certificate for the original nonconvex problem via a dual certificate, which leads to a simple feasibility problem to certify global optimality of a candidate solution on the Stiefel manifold. In addition, our relaxation reduces to an assignment linear program for jointly diagonalizable problems and is therefore known to be tight in that case. We generalize this result to show that it is also tight for close-to jointly diagonalizable problems, and we show that the HPPCA problem has this characteristic. Numerical results validate our global optimality certificate and sufficient conditions for when the SDP is tight in various problem settings.

Title: Faster Reinforcement Learning by Freezing Slow States
Authors: Yijia Wang, Daniel R. Jiang
Abstract: We study infinite horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) with "fast-slow" structure, where some state variables evolve rapidly ("fast states") while others change more gradually ("slow states"). Such structure is common in real-world problems where sequential decisions need to be made at high frequencies over long horizons, where slowly evolving information also influences optimal decisions. Examples include inventory control under slowly changing demand, or dynamic pricing with gradually shifting consumer behavior. Modeling the problem at the natural decision frequency leads to MDPs with discount factors close to one, making them computationally challenging. We propose a novel approximation strategy that "freezes" slow states during a phase of lower-level planning, solving finite-horizon MDPs conditioned on a fixed slow state, and then applying value iteration to an auxiliary upper-level MDP that evolves on a slower timescale. Freezing states for short periods of time leads to easier-to-solve lower-level problems, while a slower upper-level timescale allows for a more favorable discount factor. On the theoretical side, we analyze the regret incurred by our frozen-state approach, which leads to simple insights on how to trade off computational budget versus regret. Empirically, we demonstrate that frozen-state methods produce high-quality policies with significantly less computation, and we show that simply omitting slow states is often a poor heuristic.

Title: Modulated Differentiable STFT and Balanced Spectrum Metric for Freight Train Wheelset Bearing Cross-machine Transfer Fault Diagnosis under Speed Fluctuations
Authors: Chao He, Hongmei Shi, Ruixin Li, Jianbo Li, ZuJun Yu
Abstract: The service conditions of wheelset bearings has a direct impact on the safe operation of railway heavy haul freight trains as the key components. However, speed fluctuation of the trains and few fault samples are the two main problems that restrict the accuracy of bearing fault diagnosis. Therefore, a cross-machine transfer diagnosis (pyDSN) network coupled with interpretable modulated differentiable short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and physics-informed balanced spectrum quality metric is proposed to learn domain-invariant and discriminative features under time-varying speeds. Firstly, due to insufficiency in extracting extract frequency components of time-varying speed signals using fixed windows, a modulated differentiable STFT (MDSTFT) that is interpretable with STFT-informed theoretical support, is proposed to extract the robust time-frequency spectrum (TFS). During training process, multiple windows with different lengths dynamically change. Also, in addition to the classification metric and domain discrepancy metric, we creatively introduce a third kind of metric, referred to as the physics-informed metric, to enhance transferable TFS. A physics-informed balanced spectrum quality (BSQ) regularization loss is devised to guide an optimization direction for MDSTFT and model. With it, not only can model acquire high-quality TFS, but also a physics-restricted domain adaptation network can be also acquired, making it learn real-world physics knowledge, ultimately diminish the domain discrepancy across different datasets. The experiment is conducted in the scenario of migrating from the laboratory datasets to the freight train dataset, indicating that the hybrid-driven pyDSN outperforms existing methods and has practical value.

Title: Channel Charting in Real-World Coordinates with Distributed MIMO
Authors: Sueda Taner, Victoria Palhares, Christoph Studer
Abstract: Channel charting is an emerging self-supervised method that maps channel-state information (CSI) to a low-dimensional latent space (the channel chart) that represents pseudo-positions of user equipments (UEs). While channel charts preserve local geometry, i.e., nearby UEs are nearby in the channel chart (and vice versa), the pseudo-positions are in arbitrary coordinates and global geometry is typically not preserved. In order to embed channel charts in real-world coordinates, we first propose a bilateration loss for distributed multiple-input multiple-output (D-MIMO) wireless systems in which only the access point (AP) positions are known. The idea behind this loss is to compare the received power at pairs of APs to determine whether a UE should be placed closer to one AP or the other in the channel chart. We then propose a line-of-sight (LoS) bounding-box loss that places the UE in a predefined LoS area of each AP that is estimated to have a LoS path to the UE. We demonstrate the efficacy of combining both of these loss functions with neural-network-based channel charting using ray-tracing-based and measurement-based channel vectors. Our proposed approach outperforms several baselines and maintains the self-supervised nature of channel charting as it neither relies on geometrical propagation models nor on any ground-truth UE position information.

Title: Quantification of Multi-Compartment Flow with Spectral Diffusion MRI
Authors: Mira M. Liu, Jonathan Dyke, Thomas Gladytz, Jonas Jasse, Ian Bolger, Sergio Calle, Swathi Pavuluri, Tanner Crews, Surya Seshan, Steven Salvatore, Isaac Stillman, Thangamani Muthukumar, Bachir Taouli, Samira Farouk, Sara Lewis, Octavia Bane
Abstract: Purpose: Estimation of multi-compartment intravoxel flow in fD in ml/100g/min with multi-b-value diffusion weighted imaging and a multi-Gaussian model in the kidneys. Theory and Methods: A multi-Gaussian model of intravoxel flow using water transport time to quantify fD is presented and simulated. Multi-compartment anisotropic DWI signal is simulated analyzed with (1) a rigid bi-exponential, (2) a rigid tri-exponential, and (3) diffusion spectrum imaging model of intravoxel incoherent motion (spectral diffusion). The application is demonstrated in a two-center study of 54 kidney allografts with 9 b-value advanced DWI that were split by function (CKD-EPI 2021 eGFR<45ml/min/1.73m2) and fibrosis (Banff 2017 interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy score 0-6). Results: Spectral diffusion demonstrated strong correlation to truth for simulated three-compartment anisotropic diffusion (y=1.08x+0.1, R2=0.71) and two-compartment anisotropic diffusion (y=0.91x+0.6, R2=0.74), outperforming rigid models in cases of variable compartment number. Use of a fixed regularization parameter set to {\lambda}=0.1 increased computation up to 208-fold and agreed with voxel-wise cross-validated regularization (concordance correlation coefficient=0.99). Spectral diffusion of renal allografts showed significant increase in tissue parenchyma compartment fD (f-stat=3.86, p=0.02). Tubular fD was significantly decreased in allografts with impaired function (Mann-Whitney Utest t-stat=-2.14, p=0.04). Conclusions: Quantitative multi-compartment intravoxel flow can be estimated in ml/100g/min with fD from multi-Gaussian diffusion, even with moderate anisotropy such as in kidneys. The use of spectral diffusion with a multi-Gaussian model and a fixed regularization parameter shows promise in organs such as the kidney with variable numbers of physiologic compartments.

Title: Fidelity-Imposed Displacement Editing for the Learn2Reg 2024 SHG-BF Challenge
Authors: Jiacheng Wang, Xiang Chen, Renjiu Hu, Rongguang Wang, Jiazheng Wang, Min Liu, Yaonan Wang, Hang Zhang
Abstract: Co-examination of second-harmonic generation (SHG) and bright-field (BF) microscopy enables the differentiation of tissue components and collagen fibers, aiding the analysis of human breast and pancreatic cancer tissues. However, large discrepancies between SHG and BF images pose challenges for current learning-based registration models in aligning SHG to BF. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal registration framework that employs fidelity-imposed displacement editing to address these challenges. The framework integrates batch-wise contrastive learning, feature-based pre-alignment, and instance-level optimization. Experimental results from the Learn2Reg COMULISglobe SHG-BF Challenge validate the effectiveness of our method, securing the 1st place on the online leaderboard.

Title: Investigation of Holographic Beamforming via Dynamic Metasurface Antennas in QoS Guaranteed Power Efficient Networks
Authors: Askin Altinoklu, Leila Musavian
Abstract: This work focuses on designing a power-efficient network for Dynamic Metasurface Antennas (DMA)-aided multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) antenna systems. Power efficiency is achieved through holographic beamforming in a DMA-aided network, minimizing total transmission power while ensuring a guaranteed signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio (SINR) for multiple users in downlink. Unlike conventional MISO systems, which have well-explored beamforming solutions, DMA require specialized methods due to their unique physical constraints and wave-domain precoding capabilities. To achieve this, optimization algorithms relying on alternating optimization and semi-definite programming, are developed, including spherical-wave channel modelling of near-field communication. In this setup, the beamforming performance of DMA-aided precoding is analyzed in comparison to its optimal limits and traditional fully digital (FD) architectures, considering the effects of the Lorentzian constraints of metasurfaces and the degree of freedom (DoF) limitations due to a reduced number of RF chains. We demonstrate that the performance gap caused by DoF constraints becomes more significant as the number of users increases, highlighting the trade-offs of DMA in high-density wireless networks.

Title: Large Wireless Model (LWM): A Foundation Model for Wireless Channels
Authors: Sadjad Alikhani, Gouranga Charan, Ahmed Alkhateeb
Abstract: This paper presents Large Wireless Model (LWM) -- the world's first foundation model for wireless channels. Designed as a task-agnostic model, LWM generates universal, rich, contextualized channel embeddings (features) that potentially enhance performance across a wide range of downstream tasks in wireless communication and sensing systems. Towards this objective, LWM, which has a transformer-based architecture, was pre-trained in a self-supervised manner on large-scale wireless channel datasets. Our results show consistent improvements in downstream tasks when using the LWM embeddings compared to raw channel representations, especially in scenarios with high-complexity machine learning tasks and limited training datasets. This LWM's ability to learn from large-scale wireless data opens a promising direction for intelligent systems that can efficiently adapt to diverse tasks with limited data, paving the way for addressing key challenges in wireless communication and sensing systems.

Title: DGSNA: prompt-based Dynamic Generative Scene-based Noise Addition method
Authors: Zihao Chen, Zhentao Lin, Bi Zeng, Linyi Huang, Zhi Li, Jia Cai
Abstract: To ensure the reliable operation of speech systems across diverse environments, noise addition methods have emerged as the prevailing solution. However, existing methods offer limited coverage of real-world noisy scenes and depend on pre-existing scene-based information and noise. This paper presents prompt-based Dynamic Generative Scene-based Noise Addition (DGSNA), a novel noise addition methodology that integrates Dynamic Generation of Scene-based Information (DGSI) with Scene-based Noise Addition for Speech (SNAS). This integration facilitates automated scene-based noise addition by transforming clean speech into various noise environments, thereby providing a more comprehensive and realistic simulation of diverse noise conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that DGSNA significantly enhances the robustness of speech recognition and keyword spotting models across various noise conditions, achieving a relative improvement of up to 11.21%. Furthermore, DGSNA can be effectively integrated with other noise addition methods to enhance performance. Our implementation and demonstrations are available at this https URL.

Title: PATH: A Discrete-sequence Dataset for Evaluating Online Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Approaches for Multivariate Time Series
Authors: Lucas Correia, Jan-Christoph Goos, Thomas Bäck, Anna V. Kononova
Abstract: Benchmarking anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time series is a challenging task due to a lack of high-quality datasets. Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. Additionally, our dataset represents a discrete-sequence problem, which remains unaddressed by previously-proposed solutions in literature. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data. Furthermore, results show that the threshold used can have a large influence on detection performance, hence more work needs to be invested in methods to find a suitable threshold without the need for labelled data.

Title: Large Language Model-based Decision-making for COLREGs and the Control of Autonomous Surface Vehicles
Authors: Klinsmann Agyei, Pouria Sarhadi, Wasif Naeem
Abstract: In the field of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs), devising decision-making and obstacle avoidance solutions that address maritime COLREGs (Collision Regulations), primarily defined for human operators, has long been a pressing challenge. Recent advancements in explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning have shown promise in enabling human-like decision-making. Notably, significant developments have occurred in the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to the decision-making of complex systems, such as self-driving cars. The textual and somewhat ambiguous nature of COLREGs (from an algorithmic perspective), however, poses challenges that align well with the capabilities of LLMs, suggesting that LLMs may become increasingly suitable for this application soon. This paper presents and demonstrates the first application of LLM-based decision-making and control for ASVs. The proposed method establishes a high-level decision-maker that uses online collision risk indices and key measurements to make decisions for safe manoeuvres. A tailored design and runtime structure is developed to support training and real-time action generation on a realistic ASV model. Local planning and control algorithms are integrated to execute the commands for waypoint following and collision avoidance at a lower level. To the authors' knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to apply explainable AI to the dynamic control problem of maritime systems recognising the COLREGs rules, opening new avenues for research in this challenging area. Results obtained across multiple test scenarios demonstrate the system's ability to maintain online COLREGs compliance, accurate waypoint tracking, and feasible control, while providing human-interpretable reasoning for each decision.

Title: Neural Port-Hamiltonian Differential Algebraic Equations for Compositional Learning of Electrical Networks
Authors: Cyrus Neary, Nathan Tsao, Ufuk Topcu
Abstract: We develop compositional learning algorithms for coupled dynamical systems. While deep learning has proven effective at modeling complex relationships from data, compositional couplings between system components typically introduce algebraic constraints on state variables, posing challenges to many existing data-driven approaches to modeling dynamical systems. Towards developing deep learning models for constrained dynamical systems, we introduce neural port-Hamiltonian differential algebraic equations (N-PHDAEs), which use neural networks to parametrize unknown terms in both the differential and algebraic components of a port-Hamiltonian DAE. To train these models, we propose an algorithm that uses automatic differentiation to perform index reduction, automatically transforming the neural DAE into an equivalent system of neural ordinary differential equations (N-ODEs), for which established model inference and backpropagation methods exist. The proposed compositional modeling framework and learning algorithms may be applied broadly to learn control-oriented models of dynamical systems in a variety of application areas, however, in this work, we focus on their application to the modeling of electrical networks. Experiments simulating the dynamics of nonlinear circuits exemplify the benefits of our approach: the proposed N-PHDAE model achieves an order of magnitude improvement in prediction accuracy and constraint satisfaction when compared to a baseline N-ODE over long prediction time horizons. We also validate the compositional capabilities of our approach through experiments on a simulated D.C. microgrid: we train individual N-PHDAE models for separate grid components, before coupling them to accurately predict the behavior of larger-scale networks.

Title: MMAudio: Taming Multimodal Joint Training for High-Quality Video-to-Audio Synthesis
Authors: Ho Kei Cheng, Masato Ishii, Akio Hayakawa, Takashi Shibuya, Alexander Schwing, Yuki Mitsufuji
Abstract: We propose to synthesize high-quality and synchronized audio, given video and optional text conditions, using a novel multimodal joint training framework MMAudio. In contrast to single-modality training conditioned on (limited) video data only, MMAudio is jointly trained with larger-scale, readily available text-audio data to learn to generate semantically aligned high-quality audio samples. Additionally, we improve audio-visual synchrony with a conditional synchronization module that aligns video conditions with audio latents at the frame level. Trained with a flow matching objective, MMAudio achieves new video-to-audio state-of-the-art among public models in terms of audio quality, semantic alignment, and audio-visual synchronization, while having a low inference time (1.23s to generate an 8s clip) and just 157M parameters. MMAudio also achieves surprisingly competitive performance in text-to-audio generation, showing that joint training does not hinder single-modality performance.

Title: Connecting the Unconnectable through Feedback
Authors: Yimeng Li, Yulin Shao
Abstract: Reliable uplink connectivity remains a persistent challenge for IoT devices, particularly those at the cell edge, due to their limited transmit power and single-antenna configurations. This paper introduces a novel framework aimed at connecting the unconnectable, leveraging real-time feedback from access points (APs) to enhance uplink coverage without increasing the energy consumption of IoT devices. At the core of this approach are feedback channel codes, which enable IoT devices to dynamically adapt their transmission strategies based on AP decoding feedback, thereby reducing the critical uplink SNR required for successful communication. Analytical models are developed to quantify the coverage probability and the number of connectable APs, providing a comprehensive understanding of the system's performance. Numerical results validate the proposed method, demonstrating substantial improvements in coverage range and connectivity, particularly for devices at the cell edge, with up to a 51% boost in connectable APs. Our approach offers a robust and energy-efficient solution to overcoming uplink coverage limitations, enabling IoT networks to connect devices in challenging environments.

Title: Accompaniment Prompt Adherence: A Measure for Evaluating Music Accompaniment Systems
Authors: Maarten Grachten, Javier Nistal
Abstract: Generative systems of musical accompaniments are rapidly growing, yet there are no standardized metrics to evaluate how well generations align with the conditional audio prompt. We introduce a distribution-based measure called "Accompaniment Prompt Adherence" (APA), and validate it through objective experiments on synthetic data perturbations, and human listening tests. Results show that APA aligns well with human judgments of adherence and is discriminative to transformations that degrade adherence. We release a Python implementation of the metric using the widely adopted pre-trained CLAP embedding model, offering a valuable tool for evaluating and comparing accompaniment generation systems.

Title: Theoretical Analysis of Multi-coding with Arbitrary Correlations Among the Codes
Authors: Brian Nelson, Behrouz Farhang-Boroujeny
Abstract: The use of non-orthogonal signals has several benefits over orthogonal signals in multi-coded communications. We provide a novel, theoretical study of non-orthogonal signaling to expand the applicability of these schemes. Motivated by a class of multi-carrier spread spectrum systems, this paper presents a thorough symbol error rate analysis of the broad class of multi-code signaling methods when they make use of codes which are not necessarily orthogonal. Our analysis is also extended to the case where the code set includes the negative of each code vector, i.e., an extension to biorthogonal signaling. Moreover, it is shown that the symbol error rate results derived in this paper reduce to those available in the literature when the multi-codes are orthogonal or have equal correlation between vectors. Additionally, we show how Monte Carlo integration can be used to evaluate the integrals in the error probability calculation and derive low complexity upper bounds on the error probabilities.

Title: Representation and Stability Analysis of 1D PDEs with Periodic Boundary Conditions
Authors: Declan Jagt, Sergei Chernyshenko, Matthew Peet
Abstract: PDEs with periodic boundary conditions are frequently used to model processes in large spatial environments, assuming solutions to extend periodically beyond some bounded interval. However, solutions to these PDEs often do not converge to a unique equilibrium, but instead converge to non-stationary trajectories existing in the nullspace of the spatial differential operator (e.g. $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}$). To analyse this convergence behaviour, in this paper, it is shown how such trajectories can be modeled for a broad class of linear, 2nd order, 1D PDEs with periodic as well as more general boundary conditions, using the Partial Integral Equation (PIE) representation. In particular, it is first shown how any PDE state satisfying these boundary conditions can be uniquely expressed in terms of two components, existing in the image and the nullspace of the differential operator $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}$, respectively. An equivalent representation of linear PDEs is then derived as a PIE, explicitly defining the dynamics of both state components. Finally, a notion of exponential stability is defined that requires only one of the state components to converge to zero, and it is shown how this stability notion can be tested by solving a linear operator inequality. The proposed methodology is applied to two examples, demonstrating that exponential stability can be verified with tight bounds on the rate of decay.

Title: Improving Mixed-Criticality Scheduling with Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Muhammad El-Mahdy, Nourhan Sakr, Rodrigo Carrasco
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning (RL) approach to scheduling mixed-criticality (MC) systems on processors with varying speeds. Building upon the foundation laid by [1], we extend their work to address the non-preemptive scheduling problem, which is known to be NP-hard. By modeling this scheduling challenge as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), we develop an RL agent capable of generating near-optimal schedules for real-time MC systems. Our RL-based scheduler prioritizes high-critical tasks while maintaining overall system performance. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach. The RL scheduler significantly improves task completion rates, achieving around 80% overall and 85% for high-criticality tasks across 100,000 instances of synthetic data and real data under varying system conditions. Moreover, under stable conditions without degradation, the scheduler achieves 94% overall task completion and 93% for high-criticality tasks. These results highlight the potential of RL-based schedulers in real-time and safety-critical applications, offering substantial improvements in handling complex and dynamic scheduling scenarios.

Title: Grant-Free Random Access in Uplink LEO Satellite Communications with OFDM
Authors: Rui Mao, Yongpeng Wu, Boxiao Shen, Symeon Chatzinotas, Björn Ottersten, Wenjun Zhang
Abstract: This paper investigates joint device activity detection and channel estimation for grant-free random access in Low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications. We consider uplink communications from multiple single-antenna terrestrial users to a LEO satellite equipped with a uniform planar array of multiple antennas, where orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation is adopted. To combat the severe Doppler shift, a transmission scheme is proposed, where the discrete prolate spheroidal basis expansion model (DPS-BEM) is introduced to reduce the number of unknown channel parameters. Then the vector approximate message passing (VAMP) algorithm is employed to approximate the minimum mean square error estimation of the channel, and the Markov random field is combined to capture the channel sparsity. Meanwhile, the expectation-maximization (EM) approach is integrated to learn the hyperparameters in priors. Finally, active devices are detected by calculating energy of the estimated channel. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional algorithms in terms of activity error rate and channel estimation precision.

Title: Inter-event Interval Microscopy for Event Cameras
Authors: Changqing Su, Yanqin Chen, Zihan Lin, Zhen Cheng, You Zhou, Bo Xiong, Zhaofei Yu, Tiejun Huang
Abstract: Event cameras, an innovative bio-inspired sensor, differ from traditional cameras by sensing changes in intensity rather than directly perceiving intensity and recording these variations as a continuous stream of "events". The intensity reconstruction from these sparse events has long been a challenging problem. Previous approaches mainly focused on transforming motion-induced events into videos or achieving intensity imaging for static scenes by integrating modulation devices at the event camera acquisition end. In this paper, for the first time, we achieve event-to-intensity conversion using a static event camera for both static and dynamic scenes in fluorescence microscopy. Unlike conventional methods that primarily rely on event integration, the proposed Inter-event Interval Microscopy (IEIM) quantifies the time interval between consecutive events at each pixel. With a fixed threshold in the event camera, the time interval can precisely represent the intensity. At the hardware level, the proposed IEIM integrates a pulse light modulation device within a microscope equipped with an event camera, termed Pulse Modulation-based Event-driven Fluorescence Microscopy. Additionally, we have collected IEIMat dataset under various scenes including high dynamic range and high-speed scenarios. Experimental results on the IEIMat dataset demonstrate that the proposed IEIM achieves superior spatial and temporal resolution, as well as a higher dynamic range, with lower bandwidth compared to other methods. The code and the IEIMat dataset will be made publicly available.
