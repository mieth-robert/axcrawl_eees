Title: Generalizable Pareto-Optimal Offloading with Reinforcement Learning in Mobile Edge Computing
Authors: Ning Yang, Junrui Wen, Meng Zhang, Ming Tang
Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) is essential for next-generation mobile network applications that prioritize various performance metrics, including delays and energy efficiency. However, conventional single-objective scheduling solutions cannot be directly applied to practical systems in which the preferences (i.e., the weights of different objectives) are often unknown or challenging to specify in advance. In this study, we formulate a multi-objective offloading problem for MEC with multiple edges to minimize the sum of expected long-term energy consumption and delay while considering unknown preferences. To address the challenge of unknown preferences and the potentially diverse MEC systems, we propose a generalizable multi-objective (deep) reinforcement learning (GMORL)-based tasks offloading framework, which employs the Discrete Soft Actor-Critic (Discrete-SAC) method. Our method uses a single policy model to efficiently schedule tasks based on varying preferences and adapt to heterogeneous MEC systems with different CPU frequencies and server quantities. Under the proposed framework, we introduce a histogram-based state encoding method for constructing features for multiple edges in MEC systems, a sophisticated reward function for accurately computing the utilities of delay and energy consumption, and a novel neural network architecture for improving generalization. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed GMORL scheme enhances the hypervolume of the Pareto front by up to $121.0\%$ compared to benchmarks. Our code are avavilable at this https URL

Title: Development of AI-integrated infrastructure with biomedical device and mobile app for neonatal vital monitoring during and in between kangaroo care sessions
Authors: Saptarshi Purkayastha, Hrishikesh Bhagwat, Keerthika Sunchu, Orlando Hoilett, Eddy Odari, Reuben Thuo, Martin Wafula, Celia Kariuki, Sherri Bucher
Abstract: Premature infant mortality remains a critical challenge in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with continuous vital sign monitoring being essential for early detection of life-threatening conditions. This paper presents an integrated system combining NeoWarm, a novel biomedical device, with NeoRoo, a mobile application, and NeoSmartML, a machine learning infrastructure, to enable comprehensive vital sign monitoring during Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC). Our power-optimized device achieves 6-6.5 days of continuous operation on a single charge, while the mobile application implements an offline-first architecture with efficient data synchronization. The optical character recognition pipeline demonstrates promising accuracy (F1 scores 0.78-0.875) for automated vital sign extraction from existing NICU monitors. Experimental validation shows the system's feasibility for deployment in resource-constrained settings, though further optimization of heart rate and temperature detection, along with the risk classification foundation model is needed.

Title: Distributed Gossip-GAN for Low-overhead CSI Feedback Training in FDD mMIMO-OFDM Systems
Authors: Yuwen Cao, Guijun Liu, Tomoaki Ohtsuki, Howard H. Yang, Tony Q. S. Quek
Abstract: The deep autoencoder (DAE) framework has turned out to be efficient in reducing the channel state information (CSI) feedback overhead in massive multiple-input multipleoutput (mMIMO) systems. However, these DAE approaches presented in prior works rely heavily on large-scale data collected through the base station (BS) for model training, thus rendering excessive bandwidth usage and data privacy issues, particularly for mMIMO systems. When considering users' mobility and encountering new channel environments, the existing CSI feedback models may often need to be retrained. Returning back to previous environments, however, will make these models perform poorly and face the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To solve the above challenging problems, we propose a novel gossiping generative adversarial network (Gossip-GAN)-aided CSI feedback training framework. Notably, Gossip-GAN enables the CSI feedback training with low-overhead while preserving users' privacy. Specially, each user collects a small amount of data to train a GAN model. Meanwhile, a fully distributed gossip-learning strategy is exploited to avoid model overfitting, and to accelerate the model training as well. Simulation results demonstrate that Gossip-GAN can i) achieve a similar CSI feedback accuracy as centralized training with real-world datasets, ii) address catastrophic forgetting challenges in mobile scenarios, and iii) greatly reduce the uplink bandwidth usage. Besides, our results show that the proposed approach possesses an inherent robustness.

Title: FlowECG: Using Flow Matching to Create a More Efficient ECG Signal Generator
Authors: Vitalii Bondar, Serhii Semenov, Vira Babenko, Dmytro Holovniak
Abstract: Synthetic electrocardiogram generation serves medical AI applications requiring privacy-preserving data sharing and training dataset augmentation. Current diffusion-based methods achieve high generation quality but require hundreds of neural network evaluations during sampling, creating computational bottlenecks for clinical deployment. We propose FlowECG, a flow matching approach that adapts the SSSD-ECG architecture by replacing the iterative diffusion process with continuous flow dynamics. Flow matching learns direct transport paths from noise to data distributions through ordinary differential equation solving. We evaluate our method on the PTB-XL dataset using Dynamic Time Warping, Wasserstein distance, Maximum Mean Discrepancy, and spectral similarity metrics. FlowECG matches SSSD-ECG performance at 200 neural function evaluations, outperforming the baseline on three metrics. The key finding shows that FlowECG maintains generation quality with substantially fewer sampling steps, achieving comparable results with 10-25 evaluations compared to 200 for diffusion methods. This efficiency improvement reduces computational requirements by an order of magnitude while preserving physiologically realistic 12-lead ECG characteristics. The approach enables practical deployment in resource-limited clinical settings where real-time generation or large-scale synthetic data creation is needed.

Title: MIDOG 2025 Track 2: A Deep Learning Model for Classification of Atypical and Normal Mitotic Figures under Class and Hardness Imbalances
Authors: Sujatha Kotte, Vangala Govindakrishnan Saipradeep, Vidushi Walia, Dhandapani Nandagopal, Thomas Joseph, Naveen Sivadasan, Bhagat Singh Lali
Abstract: Motivation: Accurate classification of mitotic figures into normal and atypical types is crucial for tumor prognostication in digital pathology. However, developing robust deep learning models for this task is challenging due to the subtle morphological differences, as well as significant class and hardness imbalances in real-world histopathology datasets. Methods: We propose a novel deep learning approach based on a ResNet backbone with specialized classification heads. Our architecture uniquely models both the mitotic figure phenotype and the instance difficulty simultaneously. This method is specifically designed to handle the challenges of diverse tissue types, scanner variability, and imbalanced data. We employed focal loss to effectively mitigate the pronounced class imbalance, and a comprehensive data augmentation pipeline was implemented to enhance the model's robustness and generalizability. Results: Our approach demonstrated strong and consistent performance. In a 5-fold cross-validation on the MIDOG 2025 Track 2 dataset, it achieved a mean balanced accuracy of 0.8744 +/- 0.0093 and an ROC AUC of 0.9505 +/- 0.029. The model showed robust generalization across preliminary leaderboard evaluations, achieving an overall balanced accuracy of 0.8736 +/- 0.0204. Conclusion: The proposed method offers a reliable and generalizable solution for the classification of atypical and normal mitotic figures. By addressing the inherent challenges of real world data, our approach has the potential to support precise prognostic assessments in clinical practice and improve consistency in pathological diagnosis.

Title: FireGNN: Neuro-Symbolic Graph Neural Networks with Trainable Fuzzy Rules for Interpretable Medical Image Classification
Authors: Prajit Sengupta, Islem Rekik
Abstract: Medical image classification requires not only high predictive performance but also interpretability to ensure clinical trust and adoption. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful framework for modeling relational structures within datasets; however, standard GNNs often operate as black boxes, limiting transparency and usability, particularly in clinical settings. In this work, we present an interpretable graph-based learning framework named FireGNN that integrates trainable fuzzy rules into GNNs for medical image classification. These rules embed topological descriptors - node degree, clustering coefficient, and label agreement - using learnable thresholds and sharpness parameters to enable intrinsic symbolic reasoning. Additionally, we explore auxiliary self-supervised tasks (e.g., homophily prediction, similarity entropy) as a benchmark to evaluate the contribution of topological learning. Our fuzzy-rule-enhanced model achieves strong performance across five MedMNIST benchmarks and the synthetic dataset MorphoMNIST, while also generating interpretable rule-based explanations. To our knowledge, this is the first integration of trainable fuzzy rules within a GNN.

Title: Data-Efficient Psychiatric Disorder Detection via Self-supervised Learning on Frequency-enhanced Brain Networks
Authors: Mujie Liu, Mengchu Zhu, Qichao Dong, Ting Dang, Jiangang Ma, Jing Ren, Feng Xia
Abstract: Psychiatric disorders involve complex neural activity changes, with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data serving as key diagnostic evidence. However, data scarcity and the diverse nature of fMRI information pose significant challenges. While graph-based self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have shown promise in brain network analysis, they primarily focus on time-domain representations, often overlooking the rich information embedded in the frequency domain. To overcome these limitations, we propose Frequency-Enhanced Network (FENet), a novel SSL framework specially designed for fMRI data that integrates time-domain and frequency-domain information to improve psychiatric disorder detection in small-sample datasets. FENet constructs multi-view brain networks based on the inherent properties of fMRI data, explicitly incorporating frequency information into the learning process of representation. Additionally, it employs domain-specific encoders to capture temporal-spectral characteristics, including an efficient frequency-domain encoder that highlights disease-relevant frequency features. Finally, FENet introduces a domain consistency-guided learning objective, which balances the utilization of diverse information and generates frequency-enhanced brain graph representations. Experiments on two real-world medical datasets demonstrate that FENet outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining strong performance in minimal data conditions. Furthermore, we analyze the correlation between various frequency-domain features and psychiatric disorders, emphasizing the critical role of high-frequency information in disorder detection.

Title: An Interpretable Ensemble Framework for Multi-Omics Dementia Biomarker Discovery Under HDLSS Conditions
Authors: Byeonghee Lee, Joonsung Kang
Abstract: Biomarker discovery in neurodegenerative diseases requires robust, interpretable frameworks capable of integrating high-dimensional multi-omics data under low-sample conditions. We propose a novel ensemble approach combining Graph Attention Networks (GAT), MultiOmics Variational AutoEncoder (MOVE), Elastic-net sparse regression, and Storey's False Discovery Rate (FDR). This framework is benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods including DIABLO, MOCAT, AMOGEL, and MOMLIN. We evaluate performance using both simulated multi-omics data and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Our method demonstrates superior predictive accuracy, feature selection precision, and biological relevance. Biomarker gene maps derived from both datasets are visualized and interpreted, offering insights into latent molecular mechanisms underlying dementia.

Title: Analysis and Design of Spare Strategy for Large-Scale Satellite Constellation Using Direct Insertion under (r,q) Policy
Authors: Seungyeop Han, Zachary Grieser, Shoji Yoshikawa, Takumi Noro, Takumi Suda, Koki Ho
Abstract: This paper introduces a Markov chain-based approach for the analysis and optimization of spare-management policies in large-scale satellite constellations. Focusing on the direct strategy, we model spare replenishment as a periodic-review reorder-point/order-quantity policy, where spares are deployed directly to constellation planes. The stochastic behavior of satellite failures and launch vehicle lead times is captured through Markov representations of both failure and replenishment dynamics. Based on this efficient and accurate framework, we construct and solve an optimization problem aimed at minimizing operational costs. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a case study using a real-world mega-constellation.

Title: Automated Cervical Os Segmentation for Camera-Guided, Speculum-Free Screening
Authors: Aoife McDonald-Bowyer, Anjana Wijekoon, Ryan Laurance Love, Katie Allan, Scott Colvin, Aleksandra Gentry-Maharaj, Adeola Olaitan, Danail Stoyanov, Agostino Stilli, Sophia Bano
Abstract: Cervical cancer is highly preventable, yet persistent barriers to screening limit progress toward elimination goals. Speculum-free devices that integrate imaging and sampling could improve access, particularly in low-resource settings, but require reliable visual guidance. This study evaluates deep learning methods for real-time segmentation of the cervical os in transvaginal endoscopic images. Five encoder-decoder architectures were compared using 913 frames from 200 cases in the IARC Cervical Image Dataset, annotated by gynaecologists. Performance was assessed using IoU, DICE, detection rate, and distance metrics with ten-fold cross-validation. EndoViT/DPT, a vision transformer pre-trained on surgical video, achieved the highest DICE (0.50 \pm 0.31) and detection rate (0.87 \pm 0.33), outperforming CNN-based approaches. External validation with phantom data demonstrated robust segmentation under variable conditions at 21.5 FPS, supporting real-time feasibility. These results establish a foundation for integrating automated os recognition into speculum-free cervical screening devices to support non-expert use in both high- and low-resource contexts.

Title: Complexity Reduction for TSO-DSO Coordination: Flexibility Aggregation vs. Distributed Optimization
Authors: Maísa Beraldo Bandeira, Alexander Engelmann, Timm Faulwasser
Abstract: The increasing number of flexible devices and distributed energy resources in power grids renders the coordination of transmission and distribution systems increasingly complex. In this paper, we discuss and compare two different approaches to optimization-based complexity reduction: Flexibility aggregation via Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) and distributed optimization via the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Flexibility aggregation achieves near-optimal solutions with minimal communication. However, its performance depends on the quality of the approximation used. In contrast, ADMM attains results closer to the centralized solution but requires significantly more communication steps. We draw upon a case study combining different matpower benchmarks to compare both methods.

Title: Optimal Path Planning for Wheel Loader Automation Enabled by Efficient Soil-Tool Interaction Modeling
Authors: Armin Abdolmohammadi, Navid Mojahed, Bahram Ravani, Shima Nazari
Abstract: Earthmoving operations with wheel loaders require substantial power and incur high operational costs. This work presents an efficient automation framework based on the Fundamental Earthmoving Equation (FEE) for soil-tool interaction modeling. A reduced-order multi-step parameter estimation method guided by Sobol's global sensitivity analysis is deployed for accurate, online excavation force prediction. An optimal control problem is then formulated to compute energy-efficient bucket trajectories using soil parameters identified in the previous digging cycle. High-fidelity simulations in Algoryx Dynamics confirm accurate force prediction and demonstrate 15-40% energy savings compared to standard paths. The total computation time is comparable to a single digging cycle, highlighting the framework's potential for real-time, energy-optimized wheel loader automation.

Title: Uplink and Downlink Communications in Segmented Waveguide-Enabled Pinching-Antenna Systems (SWANs)
Authors: Chongjun Ouyang, Hao Jiang, Zhaolin Wang, Yuanwei Liu, Zhiguo Ding
Abstract: A segmented waveguide-enabled pinching-antenna system (SWAN) is proposed, in which a segmented waveguide composed of multiple short dielectric waveguide segments is employed to radiate or receive signals through the pinching antennas (PAs) deployed on each segment. Based on this architecture, three practical operating protocols are proposed: segment selection (SS), segment aggregation (SA), and segment multiplexing (SM). For uplink SWAN communications, where one PA is activated per segment, the segmented structure eliminates the inter-antenna radiation effect, i.e., signals captured by one PA may re-radiate through other PAs along the same waveguide. This yields a tractable and physically consistent uplink signal model for a multi-PA pinching-antenna system (PASS), which has not been established for conventional PASS using a single long waveguide. Building on this model, PA placement algorithms are proposed to maximize the uplink signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Closed-form expressions for the received SNR under the three protocols are derived, and the corresponding scaling laws with respect to the number of segments are analyzed. It is proven that the segmented architecture reduces both the average PA-to-user distance and the PA-to-feed distance, thereby mitigating both large-scale path loss and in-waveguide propagation loss. These results are extended to downlink SWAN communications, where multiple PAs are activated per segment, and PA placement methods are proposed to maximize the downlink received SNR under the three protocols. Numerical results demonstrate that: \romannumeral1) among the three protocols, SM achieves the best performance, followed by SA and then SS; and \romannumeral2) for all protocols, the proposed SWAN achieves a higher SNR than conventional PASS with a single long waveguide in both uplink and downlink scenarios.

Title: A Linear Programming Framework for Optimal Event-Triggered LQG Control
Authors: Zahra Hashemi, Dipankar Maity
Abstract: This letter explores intelligent scheduling of sensor-to-controller communication in networked control systems, particularly when data transmission incurs a cost. While the optimal controller in a standard linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) setup can be computed analytically, deter- mining the optimal times to transmit sensor data remains computationally and analytically challenging. We show that, through reformulation and the introduction of auxiliary binary variables, the scheduling problem can be cast as a computationally efficient mixed-integer linear program (MILP). This formulation not only simplifies the analysis but also reveals structural insights and provides clear decision criteria at each step. Embedding the approach within a model predictive control (MPC) framework enables dynamic adaptation, and we prove that the resulting scheduler per- forms at least as well as any deterministic strategy (e.g., periodic strategy). Simulation results further demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms traditional peri- odic scheduling.

Title: Sound Matching an Analogue Levelling Amplifier Using the Newton-Raphson Method
Authors: Chin-Yun Yu, György Fazekas
Abstract: Automatic differentiation through digital signal processing algorithms for virtual analogue modelling has recently gained popularity. These algorithms are typically more computationally efficient than black-box neural networks that rely on dense matrix multiplications. Due to their differentiable nature, they can be integrated with neural networks and jointly trained using gradient descent algorithms, resulting in more efficient systems. Furthermore, signal processing algorithms have significantly fewer parameters than neural networks, allowing the application of the Newton-Raphson method. This method offers faster and more robust convergence than gradient descent at the cost of quadratic storage. This paper presents a method to emulate analogue levelling amplifiers using a feed-forward digital compressor with parameters optimised via the Newton-Raphson method. We demonstrate that a digital compressor can successfully approximate the behaviour of our target unit, the Teletronix LA-2A. Different strategies for computing the Hessian matrix are benchmarked. We leverage parallel algorithms for recursive filters to achieve efficient training on modern GPUs. The resulting model is made into a VST plugin and is open-sourced at this https URL.

Title: Combinatorial Control Barrier Functions: Nested Boolean and p-choose-r Compositions of Safety Constraints
Authors: Pio Ong, Haejoon Lee, Tamas G. Molnar, Dimitra Panagou, Aaron D. Ames
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of composing multiple control barrier functions (CBFs) -- and matrix control barrier functions (MCBFs) -- through logical and combinatorial operations. Standard CBF formulations naturally enable conjunctive (AND) combinations, but disjunctive (OR) and more general logical structures introduce nonsmoothness and possibly a combinatorial blow-up in the number of logical combinations. We introduce the framework of combinatorial CBFs that addresses p-choose-r safety specifications and their nested composition. The proposed framework ensures safety for the exact safe set in a scalable way, using the original number of primitive constraints. We establish theoretical guarantees on safety under these compositions, and we demonstrate their use on a patrolling problem in a multi-agent system.

Title: Multi-sectoral Impacts of H2 and Synthetic Fuels Adoption for Heavy-duty Transportation Decarbonization
Authors: Youssef Shaker, Jun Wen Law, Audun Botterud, Dharik Mallapragada
Abstract: Policies focused on deep decarbonization of regional economies emphasize electricity sector decarbonization alongside electrification of end-uses. There is growing interest in utilizing hydrogen (H2) produced via electricity to displace fossil fuels in difficult-to-electrify sectors. One such case is heavy-duty vehicles (HDV), which represent a substantial and growing share of transport emissions as light-duty vehicles electrify. Here, we assess the bulk energy system impact of decarbonizing the HDV segment via either H2, or drop-in synthetic liquid fuels produced from H2 and CO2. Our analysis soft-links two modeling approaches: (a) a bottom-up transport demand model producing a variety of final energy demand scenarios for the same service demand and (b) a multi-sectoral capacity expansion model that co-optimizes power, H2 and CO2 supply chains under technological and policy constraints to meet exogenous final energy demands. Through a case study of Western Europe in 2040 under deep decarbonization constraints, we quantify the energy system implications of different levels of H2 and synthetic fuels adoption in the HDV sector under scenarios with and without CO2 sequestration. In the absence of CO2 storage, substitution of liquid fossil fuels in HDVs is essential to meet the deep decarbonization constraint across the modeled power, H2 and transport sectors. Additionally, utilizing H2 HDVs reduces decarbonization costs and fossil liquids demand, but could increase natural gas consumption. While H2 HDV adoption reduces the need for direct air capture (DAC), synthetic fuel adoption increases DAC investments and total system costs. The study highlights the trade-offs across transport decarbonization pathways, and underscores the importance of multi-sectoral consideration in decarbonization studies.

Title: Quasi-Deterministic Modeling of Sub-THz Band Access Channels in Street Canyon Environments
Authors: Minseok Kim, Masato Yomoda, Minghe Mao, Nobuaki Kuno, Koshiro Kitao, Satoshi Suyama
Abstract: Sub-terahertz (sub-THz) frequencies (100--300 GHz) are expected to play a key role in beyond-5G and 6G mobile networks. However, their quasi-optical propagation characteristics require new channel models beyond sub-100 GHz extrapolations. This paper presents an extensive double-directional (D-D) channel measurement campaign conducted in an outdoor street-canyon environment at 154 GHz and 300 GHz under both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions using an in-house-developed channel sounder. Based on these measurements, clustering with merged datasets across the two frequencies enables comparative analyses that identify both common and distinct multipath clusters, as well as the frequency dependence of cluster-level characteristics. A quasi-deterministic (QD) channel model is then proposed, combining deterministic components, such as LoS and single-bounce reflections from side walls, with random components. Large-scale parameters (path loss, delay spread, angular spread, and Rician K-factor) are also evaluated. These results provide valuable insights into sub-THz propagation in urban street canyons and contribute toward the development of accurate, channel models for future 6G systems.

Title: Language-based Color ISP Tuning
Authors: Owen Mayer, Shohei Noguchi, Alexander Berestov, Jiro Takatori
Abstract: We propose a method for tuning the parameters of a color adjustment Image Signal Processor (ISP) algorithmic "block" using language prompts. This enables the user to impart a particular visual style to the ISP-processed image simply by describing it through a text prompt. To do this, we first implement the ISP block in a differentiable manner. Then, we define an objective function using an off-the-shelf, pretrained vision-language model (VLM) such that the objective is minimized when the ISP processed image is most visually similar to the input language prompt. Finally, we optimize the ISP parameters using gradient descent. Experimental results demonstrate tuning of ISP parameters with different language prompts, and compare the performance of different pretrained VLMs and optimization strategies.

Title: Hybrid Atomic Norm Sparse/Diffuse Channel Estimation
Authors: Lei Lyu, Urbashi Mitra
Abstract: In this paper, the hybrid sparse/diffuse (HSD) channel model in frequency domain is proposed. Based on the structural analysis on the resolvable paths and diffuse scattering statistics in the channel, the Hybrid Atomic-Least-Squares (HALS) algorithm is designed to estimate sparse/diffuse components with a combined atomic and l2 regularization. A theoretical analysis is conducted on the Lagrangian dual problem and the conditions needed to be satisfied by primal and dual solutions are provided. This analysis, in turn, suggests an algorithm for optimal frequency support estimation. Debiased methods for improved channel estimation are provided. Given differing amounts of side information, performance bounds are derived in terms of a genie-aided estimator and constrained Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLB). Numerical results via simulations on synthetic data as well as real experimental data validate the efficacy of the proposed method. There are clear tradeoffs with respect to the properties of the channel with respect to performance: sparsity of specular paths and relative energy of diffuse components.

Title: Adapting Medical Vision Foundation Models for Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation via Active Learning and Selective Semi-supervised Fine-tuning
Authors: Jin Yang, Daniel S. Marcus, Aristeidis Sotiras
Abstract: Medical Vision Foundation Models (Med-VFMs) have superior capabilities of interpreting medical images due to the knowledge learned from self-supervised pre-training with extensive unannotated images. To improve their performance on adaptive downstream evaluations, especially segmentation, a few samples from target domains are selected randomly for fine-tuning them. However, there lacks works to explore the way of adapting Med-VFMs to achieve the optimal performance on target domains efficiently. Thus, it is highly demanded to design an efficient way of fine-tuning Med-VFMs by selecting informative samples to maximize their adaptation performance on target domains. To achieve this, we propose an Active Source-Free Domain Adaptation (ASFDA) method to efficiently adapt Med-VFMs to target domains for volumetric medical image segmentation. This ASFDA employs a novel Active Learning (AL) method to select the most informative samples from target domains for fine-tuning Med-VFMs without the access to source pre-training samples, thus maximizing their performance with the minimal selection budget. In this AL method, we design an Active Test Time Sample Query strategy to select samples from the target domains via two query metrics, including Diversified Knowledge Divergence (DKD) and Anatomical Segmentation Difficulty (ASD). DKD is designed to measure the source-target knowledge gap and intra-domain diversity. It utilizes the knowledge of pre-training to guide the querying of source-dissimilar and semantic-diverse samples from the target domains. ASD is designed to evaluate the difficulty in segmentation of anatomical structures by measuring predictive entropy from foreground regions adaptively. Additionally, our ASFDA method employs a Selective Semi-supervised Fine-tuning to improve the performance and efficiency of fine-tuning by identifying samples with high reliability from unqueried ones.

Title: Experimental Validation of Decentralized Affine Transformation
Authors: Garegin Mazmanyan, Hossein Rastgoftar
Abstract: This paper presents an experimental validation of decentralized affine transformation (AT) in multi-agent systems using teams of mini-quadcopters. The AT framework enables an agent team to safely navigate constrained, obstacle-rich environments while allowing aggressive changes in inter-agent distances, which are formally characterized through the decomposition of the AT transformation matrix. Without loss of generality, we focus on two-dimensional AT, formulated as a decentralized leader-follower problem. In this formulation, three leader quadcopters are positioned at the vertices of a triangle, while all follower quadcopters remain within the triangle. The leaders know the desired trajectories prescribed by the AT, whereas the followers do not. Instead, the followers infer their trajectories through local communication governed by fixed communication weights determined by the initial spatial configuration of the team. Experimental results validate the asymptotic convergence of decentralized AT and demonstrate its capability to safely guide multi-agent teams through obstacle-laden environments.

Title: Branched Broomrape Detection in Tomato Farms Using Satellite Imagery and Time-Series Analysis
Authors: Mohammadreza Narimani, Alireza Pourreza, Ali Moghimi, Parastoo Farajpoor, Hamid Jafarbiglu, Mohsen Mesgaran
Abstract: Branched broomrape (Phelipanche ramosa (L.) Pomel) is a chlorophyll-deficient parasitic plant that threatens tomato production by extracting nutrients from the host, with reported yield losses up to 80 percent. Its mostly subterranean life cycle and prolific seed production (more than 200,000 seeds per plant, viable for up to 20 years) make early detection essential. We present an end-to-end pipeline that uses Sentinel-2 imagery and time-series analysis to identify broomrape-infested tomato fields in California. Regions of interest were defined from farmer-reported infestations, and images with less than 10 percent cloud cover were retained. We processed 12 spectral bands and sun-sensor geometry, computed 20 vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, NDMI), and derived five plant traits (Leaf Area Index, Leaf Chlorophyll Content, Canopy Chlorophyll Content, Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation, and Fractional Vegetation Cover) using a neural network calibrated with ground-truth and synthetic data. Trends in Canopy Chlorophyll Content delineated transplanting-to-harvest periods, and phenology was aligned using growing degree days. Vegetation pixels were segmented and used to train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network on 18,874 pixels across 48 growing-degree-day time points. The model achieved 88 percent training accuracy and 87 percent test accuracy, with precision 0.86, recall 0.92, and F1 0.89. Permutation feature importance ranked NDMI, Canopy Chlorophyll Content, FAPAR, and a chlorophyll red-edge index as most informative, consistent with the physiological effects of infestation. Results show the promise of satellite-driven time-series modeling for scalable detection of parasitic stress in tomato farms.

Title: Self-Calibrating Integrate-and-Fire Time Encoding Machine
Authors: Maya Mekel, Vered Karp, Satish Mulleti, Alejandro Cohen
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel self-calibrating integrate-and-fire time encoding machine (S-IF-TEM) that enables simultaneous parameter estimation and signal reconstruction during sampling, thereby effectively mitigating mismatch effects. The proposed framework is developed over a new practical IF-TEM (P-IF-TEM) setting, which extends classical models by incorporating device mismatches and imperfections that can otherwise lead to significant reconstruction errors. Unlike existing IF-TEM settings, P-IF-TEM accounts for scenarios where (i) system parameters are inaccurately known and may vary over time, (ii) the integrator discharge time after firings can vary, and (iii) the sampler may operate in its nonlinear region under large input dynamic ranges. For this practical model, we derive sampling rate bounds and reconstruction conditions that ensure perfect recovery. Analytical results establish the conditions for perfect reconstruction under self-calibration, and evaluation studies demonstrate substantial improvements - exceeding 59dB - highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Title: Landscape Analysis of Simultaneous Blind Deconvolution and Phase Retrieval via Structured Low-Rank Tensor Recovery
Authors: Xiao Liang, Zhen Qin, Zhihui Zhu, Shuang Li
Abstract: This paper presents a geometric analysis of the simultaneous blind deconvolution and phase retrieval (BDPR) problem via a structured low-rank tensor recovery framework. Due to the highly complicated structure of the associated sensing tensor, directly characterizing its optimization landscape is intractable. To address this, we introduce a tensor sensing problem as a tractable surrogate that preserves the essential structural features of the target low-rank tensor while enabling rigorous theoretical analysis. As a first step toward understanding this surrogate model, we study the corresponding population risk, which captures key aspects of the underlying low-rank tensor structure. We characterize the global landscape of the population risk on the unit sphere and show that Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) converges linearly under mild conditions. We then extend the analysis to the tensor sensing problem, establishing local geometric properties, proving convergence guarantees for RGD, and quantifying robustness under measurement noise. Our theoretical results are further supported by extensive numerical experiments. These findings offer foundational insights into the optimization landscape of the structured low-rank tensor recovery problem, which equivalently characterizes the original BDPR problem, thereby providing principled guidance for solving the original BDPR problem.

Title: Online simplex-structured matrix factorization
Authors: Hugues Kouakou, José Henrique de Morais Goulart, Raffaele Vitale, Thomas Oberlin, David Rousseau, Cyril Ruckebusch, Nicolas Dobigeon
Abstract: Simplex-structured matrix factorization (SSMF) is a common task encountered in signal processing and machine learning. Minimum-volume constrained unmixing (MVCU) algorithms are among the most widely used methods to perform this task. While MVCU algorithms generally perform well in an offline setting, their direct application to online scenarios suffers from scalability limitations due to memory and computational demands. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an approach which can build upon any off-the-shelf MVCU algorithm to operate sequentially, i.e., to handle one observation at a time. The key idea of the proposed method consists in updating the solution of MVCU only when necessary, guided by an online check of the corresponding optimization problem constraints. It only stores and processes observations identified as informative with respect to the geometrical constraints underlying SSMF. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach when analyzing synthetic and real datasets, showing that it achieves estimation accuracy comparable to the offline MVCU method upon which it relies, while significantly reducing the computational cost.

Title: Control Synthesis for Multiple Reach-Avoid Tasks via Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Analysis
Authors: Yu Chen, Shaoyuan Li, Xiang Yin
Abstract: We investigate the control synthesis problem for continuous-time time-varying nonlinear systems with disturbance under a class of multiple reach-avoid (MRA) tasks. Specifically, the MRA task requires the system to reach a series of target regions in a specified order while satisfying state constraints between each pair of target arrivals. This problem is more challenging than standard reach-avoid tasks, as it requires considering the feasibility of future reach-avoid tasks during the planning process. To solve this problem, we define a series of value functions by solving a cascade of time-varying reach-avoid problems characterized by Hamilton-Jacobi variational inequalities. We prove that the super-level set of the final value function computed is exactly the feasible set of the MRA task. Additionally, we demonstrate that the control law can be effectively synthesized by ensuring the non-negativeness of the value functions over time. We also show that the Linear temporal logic task control synthesis problems can be converted to a collection of MRA task control synthesis problems by properly defining each target and state constraint set of MRA tasks. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated through four case studies on robot planning problems under time-varying nonlinear systems with disturbance.

Title: Uncertainty Quantification on State-Based Conflict Detection and Resolution Algorithms
Authors: Muhammad Fazlur Rahman, Joost Ellerbroek, Jacco Hoekstra
Abstract: This study investigates how navigation uncertainty affects conflict detection and resolution (CD&R) for uncrewed aircraft in U-space. Position and velocity errors are modelled as zero-mean Gaussian noise consistent with ADS-L accuracy, and propagated through conflict metrics using Monte Carlo and analytical approximations. Under uncertainty, state-based detection becomes probabilistic. The probability of detection depends on both the level of uncertainty and the encounter geometry, and falls below 50% when the nominal intrusion time equals the look-ahead. Operationally, detection is re-evaluated over time as the encounter develops, yielding multiple observations with varying probabilities. Two resolution algorithms are compared: Modified Voltage Potential (MVP) and Velocity Obstacle (VO). MVP proves more robust under uncertainty because it explicitly maximises distance at the closest point of approach (CPA). By maximising CPA distance, MVP maintains an outward push and avoids reversal behaviour during the manoeuvre, whereas VO performance degrades at low relative speeds and shallow angles. BlueSky simulations confirm these effects: MVP achieves higher intrusion-prevention rates and larger post-resolution miss distances across conflict scenarios, with its advantage most pronounced at low relative velocity. The findings highlight the importance of maximising CPA distance as a conflict resolution strategy. Moreover, the look-ahead horizon and protected zone can be tuned to achieve a desired target level of safety.

Title: Forecasting Self-Similar User Traffic Demand Using Transformers in LEO Satellite Networks
Authors: Yekta Demirci, Guillaume Mantelet, Stéphane Martel, Jean-François Frigon, Gunes Karabulut Kurt
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the use of a transformer-based model to address the need for forecasting user traffic demand in the next generation Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks. Considering a LEO satellite constellation, we present the need to forecast the demand for the satellites in-orbit to utilize dynamic beam-hopping in high granularity. We adopt a traffic dataset with second-order self-similar characteristics. Given this traffic dataset, the Fractional Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average (FARIMA) model is considered a benchmark forecasting solution. However, the constrained on-board processing capabilities of LEO satellites, combined with the need to fit a new model for each input sequence due to the nature of FARIMA, motivate the investigation of alternative solutions. As an alternative, a pretrained probabilistic time series model that utilizes transformers with a Prob-Sparse self-attention mechanism is considered. The considered solution is investigated under different time granularities with varying sequence and prediction lengths. Concluding this paper, we provide extensive simulation results where the transformer-based solution achieved up to six percent better forecasting accuracy on certain traffic conditions using mean squared error as the performance indicator.

Title: Design and Validation of a MATLAB-based GUI for Coarray Domain Analysis of Sparse Linear Arrays
Authors: Ashish Patwari, Ananya Pandey, Aditya Dabade, Priyadarshini Raiguru
Abstract: This work presents a first-of-its-kind graphical user interface (GUI)-based simulator developed using MATLAB App designer for the comprehensive analysis of sparse linear arrays (SLAs) in the difference coarray (DCA) domain. Sparse sensor arrays have emerged as a critical solution in enhancing signal detection, direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, and beamforming in fields such as wireless communication, radar, sonar, and integrated sensing systems. They offer several advantages over traditional uniform arrays, including reduced system complexity, lower deployment costs, and improved mitigation of mutual coupling effects. The tool enables users to input array configurations, compute DCAs, visualize weight function graphs, and assess the hole-free status of arrays, as applicable for coarray processing. Unlike conventional simulators that focus on radiation pattern visualization (array pattern, main lobe and sidelobe characteristics, azimuth cut, rectangular view, polar view etc.), this tool addresses the behavior of SLAs from a coarray domain perspective. Numerical validations demonstrate the tool's correctness, effectiveness, and its potential to foster further research in sparse arrays. This simulator could also be used as a teaching aid to drive home complicated topics and attract young minds towards the fascinating field of sparse array design.

Title: Local Density-Based Anomaly Score Normalization for Domain Generalization
Authors: Kevin Wilkinghoff, Haici Yang, Janek Ebbers, François G. Germain, Gordon Wichern, Jonathan Le Roux
Abstract: State-of-the-art anomalous sound detection (ASD) systems in domain-shifted conditions rely on projecting audio signals into an embedding space and using distance-based outlier detection to compute anomaly scores. One of the major difficulties to overcome is the so-called domain mismatch between the anomaly score distributions of a source domain and a target domain that differ acoustically and in terms of the amount of training data provided. A decision threshold that is optimal for one domain may be highly sub-optimal for the other domain and vice versa. This significantly degrades the performance when only using a single decision threshold, as is required when generalizing to multiple data domains that are possibly unseen during training while still using the same trained ASD system as in the source domain. To reduce this mismatch between the domains, we propose a simple local-density-based anomaly score normalization scheme. In experiments conducted on several ASD datasets, we show that the proposed normalization scheme consistently improves performance for various types of embedding-based ASD systems and yields better results than existing anomaly score normalization approaches.

Title: A Highly Compact Direct-Injection Power-Flow Controller and Line-Voltage Regulator with Shared Magnetics and Partial-Power Conversion for Full-Power Control
Authors: Davood Keshavarzi, Alexander Koehler, Stefan M. Goetz
Abstract: An increasing integration of photovoltaic units, electric vehicle chargers, heat pumps, and energy storage systems challenges low-voltage power grids and can cause voltage range violation, loss of stability, (local) overload of lines, and power management problems. Research suggested universal power-flow control (UPFC) to solve power management problems. In contrast to bulky, slow, and costly conventional UPFCs with their shunt and series transformers, this paper presents a highly compact and current-dense power-flow controller, which can serve between different feeders in the low-voltage power grids. The enabler is a systematic combination of silicon car-bide (SiC) with silicon (Si) transistors and a strict partial-power topology built around a multi-active bridge. The circuit links an active-front-end converter as a shunt stage through a multi-active-bridge converter bidirectionally with low-voltage series-injection modules floating with their respective phases. The topology can use small power to control high currents through the low-voltage series-injection modules. The multi-active bridge serves as a multi-input-output power router that exchanges energy between all elements. We assess the design as well as the implementation considerations of the proposed power-flow controller mathematically and verify its performance in simulation and real systems.

Title: Factor Graph Optimization for Leak Localization in Water Distribution Networks
Authors: Paul Irofti, Luis Romero-Ben, Florin Stoican, Vicenç Puig
Abstract: Detecting and localizing leaks in water distribution network systems is an important topic with direct environmental, economic, and social impact. Our paper is the first to explore the use of factor graph optimization techniques for leak localization in water distribution networks, enabling us to perform sensor fusion between pressure and demand sensor readings and to estimate the network's temporal and structural state evolution across all network nodes. The methodology introduces specific water network factors and proposes a new architecture composed of two factor graphs: a leak-free state estimation factor graph and a leak localization factor graph. When a new sensor reading is obtained, unlike Kalman and other interpolation-based methods, which estimate only the current network state, factor graphs update both current and past states. Results on Modena, L-TOWN and synthetic networks show that factor graphs are much faster than nonlinear Kalman-based alternatives such as the UKF, while also providing improvements in localization compared to state-of-the-art estimation-localization approaches. Implementation and benchmarks are available at this https URL.

Title: Real-Time Defense Against Coordinated Cyber-Physical Attacks: A Robust Constrained Reinforcement Learning Approach
Authors: Saman Mazaheri Khamaneh, Tong Wu, Wei Sun, Cong Chen
Abstract: Modern power systems face increasing vulnerability to sophisticated cyber-physical attacks beyond traditional N-1 contingency frameworks. Existing security paradigms face a critical bottleneck: efficiently identifying worst-case scenarios and rapidly coordinating defensive responses are hindered by intensive computation and time delays, during which cascading failures can propagate. This paper presents a novel tri-level robust constrained reinforcement learning (RCRL) framework for robust power system security. The framework generates diverse system states through AC-OPF formulations, identifies worst-case N-K attack scenarios for each state, and trains policies to mitigate these scenarios across all operating conditions without requiring predefined attack patterns. The framework addresses constraint satisfaction through Beta-blending projection-based feasible action mapping techniques during training and primal-dual augmented Lagrangian optimization for deployment. Once trained, the RCRL policy learns how to control observed cyber-physical attacks in real time. Validation on IEEE benchmark systems demonstrates effectiveness against coordinated N-K attacks, causing widespread cascading failures throughout the network. The learned policy can successfully respond rapidly to recover system-wide constraints back to normal within 0.21 ms inference times, establishing superior resilience for critical infrastructure protection.

Title: General Decentralized Stochastic Optimal Control via Change of Measure: Applications to the Witsenhausen Counterexample
Authors: Bhagyashri Telsang, Seddik Djouadi, Charalambos D. Charalambous
Abstract: In this paper we present global and person-by-person (PbP) optimality conditions for general decentralized stochastic dynamic optimal control problems, using a discrete-time version of Girsanov's change of measure. The PbP optimality conditions are applied to the Witsenhausen counterexample to show that the two strategies satisfy two coupled nonlinear integral equations. Further, we prove a fixed point theorem in a function space, establishing existence and uniqueness of solutions to the integral equations. We also provide numerical solutions of the two integral equations using the Gauss Hermite Quadrature scheme, and include a detail comparison to other numerical methods of the literature. The numerical solutions confirm Witsehausen's observation that, for certain choices of parameters, linear or affine strategies are optimal, while for other choices of parameters nonlinear strategies outperformed affine strategies.

Title: Privacy-Preserving Uncertainty Disclosure for Facilitating Enhanced Energy Storage Dispatch
Authors: Ning Qi, Xiaolong Jin, Kai Hou, Zeyu Liu, Hongjie Jia, Wei Wei
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel privacy-preserving uncertainty disclosure framework, enabling system operators to release marginal value function bounds to reduce the conservativeness of interval forecast and mitigate excessive withholding, thereby enhancing storage dispatch and social welfare. We propose a risk-averse analytical storage arbitrage model based on stochastic dynamic programming and explicitly account for uncertainty intervals in value function training. We derive real-time marginal value function bounds using a rolling-horizon chance-constrained economic dispatch formulation. We rigorously prove that the bounds reliably cap the true opportunity cost and dynamically converge to the hindsight value. We verify that both the marginal value function and its bounds monotonically decrease with the state of charge and increase with uncertainty, providing a theoretical basis for risk-averse strategic behaviors and SoC-dependent designs. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework via an agent-based simulation on the ISO-NE test system. Under 50% renewable capacity and 35% storage capacity, the proposed bounds enhance storage response by 38.91% and reduce the optimality gap to 3.91% through improved interval predictions. Additionally, by mitigating excessive withholding, the bounds yield an average system cost reduction of 0.23% and an average storage profit increase of 13.22%. These benefits further scale with higher prediction conservativeness, storage capacity, and system uncertainty.

Title: A Signed Friedkin-Johnsen Model for Arbitrary Network Topologies
Authors: Aashi Shrinate, Twinkle Tripathy
Abstract: The paper presents an opposing rule-based signed Friedkin-Johnsen (SFJ) model for the evolution of opinions in arbitrary network topologies with signed interactions and stubborn agents. The primary objective of the paper is to analyse the emergent behaviours of the agents under the proposed rule and to identify the key agents which contribute to the final opinions, characterised as influential agents. We start by presenting some convergence results which show how the opinions of the agents evolve for a signed network with any arbitrary topology. Throughout the paper, we classify the agents as opinion leaders (sinks in the associated condensation graph) and followers (the rest). In general, it has been shown in the literature that opinion leaders and stubborn agents drive the opinions of the group. However, the addition of signed interactions reveals interesting behaviours wherein opinion leaders can now become non-influential or less influential. Further, while the stubborn agents always continue to remain influential, they might become less influential owing to signed interactions. Additionally, the signed interactions can drive the opinions of the agents outside of the convex hull of their initial opinions. Thereafter, we propose the absolute influence centrality measure, which allows us to quantify the overall influence of all the agents in the network and also identify the most influential agents. Unlike most of the existing measures, it is applicable to any network topology and considers the effect of both stubbornness and signed interactions. Finally, simulations are presented for the Bitcoin Alpha dataset to elaborate the proposed results.

Title: Opinion Clustering under the Friedkin-Johnsen Model: Agreement in Disagreement
Authors: Aashi Shrinate, Twinkle Tripathy
Abstract: The convergence of opinions in the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) framework is well studied, but the topological conditions leading to opinion clustering remain less explored. To bridge this gap, we examine the role of topology in the emergence of opinion clusters within the network. The key contribution of the paper lies in the introduction of the notion of topologically prominent agents, referred to as Locally Topologically Persuasive (LTP) agents. Interestingly, each LTP agent is associated with a unique set of (non-influential) agents in its vicinity. Using them, we present conditions to obtain opinion clusters in the FJ framework in any arbitrarily connected digraph. A key advantage of the proposed result is that the resulting opinion clusters are independent of the edge weights and the stubbornness of the agents. Finally, we demonstrate using simulation results that, by suitably placing LTP agents, one can design networks that achieve any desired opinion clustering.

Title: BERT4beam: Large AI Model Enabled Generalized Beamforming Optimization
Authors: Yuhang Li, Yang Lu, Wei Chen, Bo Ai, Zhiguo Ding, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is anticipated to emerge as a pivotal enabler for the forthcoming sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication systems. However, current research efforts regarding large AI models for wireless communications primarily focus on fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for specific tasks. This paper investigates the large-scale AI model designed for beamforming optimization to adapt and generalize to diverse tasks defined by system utilities and scales. We propose a novel framework based on bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), termed BERT4beam. We aim to formulate the beamforming optimization problem as a token-level sequence learning task, perform tokenization of the channel state information, construct the BERT model, and conduct task-specific pre-training and fine-tuning strategies. Based on the framework, we propose two BERT-based approaches for single-task and multi-task beamforming optimization, respectively. Both approaches are generalizable for varying user scales. Moreover, the former can adapt to varying system utilities and antenna configurations by re-configuring the input and output module of the BERT model, while the latter, termed UBERT, can directly generalize to diverse tasks, due to a finer-grained tokenization strategy. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the two proposed approaches can achieve near-optimal performance and outperform existing AI models across various beamforming optimization tasks, showcasing strong adaptability and generalizability.

Title: Length-Aware Rotary Position Embedding for Text-Speech Alignment
Authors: Hyeongju Kim, Juheon Lee, Jinhyeok Yang, Jacob Morton
Abstract: Many recent text-to-speech (TTS) systems are built on transformer architectures and employ cross-attention mechanisms for text-speech alignment. Within these systems, rotary position embedding (RoPE) is commonly used to encode positional information in text and speech representations. In this work, we introduce length-aware RoPE (LARoPE), a simple yet effective extension of RoPE that improves text-speech alignment. Unlike RoPE, which relies on absolute indices, LARoPE computes relative distances between query and key positions using length-normalized indices. Experimental results show that LARoPE consistently outperforms RoPE, offering faster loss convergence, more accurate text-speech alignment, and higher overall TTS quality. Furthermore, LARoPE demonstrates greater resilience to variations in utterance duration and maintains stable performance in extended speech generation up to 30 seconds, whereas RoPE suffers from notable degradation. Notably, our method achieves a state-of-the-art word error rate on a standard zero-shot TTS benchmark.

Title: The Microwave Rainbow: How Geometry Paints Colours in Microwave Vision
Authors: Huizhang Yang
Abstract: Microwave vision from spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides an all-weather, day-and-night capability to observe Earth, yet much of the information encoded in its signals remains undeciphered. Recent high-resolution imagery has revealed a striking phenomenon: man-made structures systematically appear in a spectrum of colours, the physical origin of which has been an open question. Here we show that this effect, which we term the microwave rainbow, is a form of geometric dispersion arising from structures acting as intrinsic diffraction gratings. We introduce a geometric-physical model that provides a direct analytical link between a target's geometry and its observed colour signature. This model quantitatively explains the full range of signatures, from continuous colour gradients on curved surfaces (zero-order diffraction) to repeating spectral patterns from periodic structures (high-order diffraction). This work transforms colour from a visual artefact into a precise measure of physical form, enabling the geometry of both critical infrastructure and natural phenomena to be mapped directly from space. Our findings establish the physical basis for a new remote sensing modality: microwave colour vision, and open a new frontier in how we perceive our world.

Title: UltraUPConvNet: A UPerNet- and ConvNeXt-Based Multi-Task Network for Ultrasound Tissue Segmentation and Disease Prediction
Authors: Zhi Chen
Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is widely used in clinical practice due to its cost-effectiveness, mobility, and safety. However, current AI research often treats disease prediction and tissue segmentation as two separate tasks and their model requires substantial computational overhead. In such a situation, we introduce UltraUPConvNet, a computationally efficient universal framework designed for both ultrasound image classification and segmentation. Trained on a large-scale dataset containing more than 9,700 annotations across seven different anatomical regions, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on certain datasets with lower computational overhead.

Title: Nonreciprocal RIS-Aided Covert Channel Reciprocity Attacks and Countermeasures
Authors: Haoyu Wang, Jiawei Hu, Jiaqi Xu, Ying Ju, A. Lee Swindlehurst
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology enhances wireless communication performance, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities that can be exploited by adversaries. This paper investigates channel reciprocity attack (CRACK) threats in multi-antenna wireless systems operating in time-division duplexing mode using a physically consistent non-reciprocal RIS (NR-RIS) model. CRACK can degrade communication rate and facilitate passive eavesdropping behavior by distorting the downlink precoding, without requiring any additional signal transmission or channel state information (CSI). Unlike conventional RIS jamming strategies, the NR-RIS does not need synchronization with the legitimate system and thus can operate with slow or fixed configurations to implement CRACK, obscuring the distinction between the direct and RIS-induced channels and thereby complicating corresponding defensive precoding designs. To counter the CRACK threat posed by NR-RIS, we develop ``SecureCoder,'' a deep reinforcement learning-based framework that can mitigate CRACK and determine an improved downlink precoder matrix using the estimated uplink CSI and rate feedback from the users. Simulation results demonstrate the severe performance degradation caused by NR-RIS CRACK and validate the effectiveness of SecureCoder in improving both throughput and reducing security threats, thereby enhancing system robustness.

Title: Holographic interference surface: A proof of concept based on the principle of interferometry
Authors: Haifan Yin, Jindiao Huang, Ruikun Zhang, Jiwang Wu, Li Tan
Abstract: Revolutionizing communication architectures to achieve a balance between enhanced performance and improved efficiency is becoming increasingly critical for wireless communications as the era of ultra-large-scale arrays approaches. In traditional communication architectures, radio frequency (RF) signals are typically converted to baseband for subsequent processing through operations such as filtering, analog-to-digital conversion and down-conversion, all of which depend on expensive and power-intensive RF chains. The increased hardware complexity and escalated power consumption resulting from this dependency significantly limit the practical deployment of ultra-large-scale arrays. To address these limitations, we propose a holographic communication system based on the principle of interferometry, designated as holographic interference surfaces (HIS). Utilizing the interference effect of electromagnetic waves, HIS estimates the channel state information (CSI) by dealing solely with power information, which enables the replacement of RF chains with power sensors and completes the signal processing in radio frequency. As proof-of-concept demonstrations, we implemented a prototype system based on principles of holographic interference. Experimental results align well with theoretical predictions, confirming the practical viability and effectiveness of the proposed HIS. This work provides a new paradigm for building a more cost-effective wireless communication architecture.

Title: Fundamental limitations of sensitivity metrics for anomaly impact analysis in LTI systems
Authors: Jingwei Dong, Kangkang Zhang, Anh Tung Nguyen, André M. H. Teixeira
Abstract: This study establishes a connection between the output-to-output gain (OOG), a sensitivity metric quantifying the impact of stealthy attacks, and a novel input-to-input gain (IIG) introduced to evaluate fault sensitivity under disturbances, and investigates their fundamental performance limitations arising from the transmission zeros of the underlying dynamical system. Inspired by the OOG, which characterizes the maximum performance loss caused by stealthy attacks, the IIG is proposed as a new measure of robust fault sensitivity, and is defined as the maximum energy of undetectable faults for a given disturbance intensity. Then, using right (for OOG) and left (for IIG) co-prime factorizations, both metrics are expressed as the~$\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ norm of a ratio of the numerator factors. This unified representation facilitates a systematic analysis of their fundamental limitations. Subsequently, by utilizing the Poisson integral relation, theoretical bounds for the IIG and OOG are derived, explicitly characterizing their fundamental limitations imposed by system \mbox{non-minimum} phase (NMP) zeros. Finally, a numerical example is employed to validate the results.

Title: Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-Empowered Wireless Image Transmission over Complex Dynamic Channel
Authors: Haozhen Li, Ruide Zhang, Rongqing Zhang, Xiang Cheng
Abstract: Wireless image transmission underpins diverse networked intelligent services and becomes an increasingly critical issue. Existing works have shown that deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) is an effective framework to balance image transmission fidelity and data overhead. However, these studies oversimplify the communication system as a mere pipeline with noise, failing to account for the complex dynamics of wireless channels and concrete physical-layer transmission process. To address these limitations, we propose a Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-empowered Dynamic Channel Adaptive Transmission (DCAT) scheme, designed for practical implementation in real communication scenarios. Building upon the Swin Transformer backbone, our DCAT scheme demonstrates robust adaptability to time-selective fading and channel aging effects by effectively utilizing the physical-layer transmission characteristics of wireless channels. Comprehensive experimental results confirm that DCAT consistently achieves superior performance compared with JSCC baseline approaches across all conditions. Furthermore, our neural network architecture demonstrates high scalability due to its interpretable design, offering substantial potential for cost-efficient deployment in practical applications.

Title: Dynamic Modeling, Analysis, and Validation of Dual-Port Grid-Forming Control for Hybrid AC/DC Systems
Authors: Irina Subotić, Dominic Groß, Alexander Winkens, Julian Jansen, Florian Klein-Helmkamp, Andreas Ulbig
Abstract: This work investigates the transient and dynamical behavior of hybrid AC/DC systems using dual-port grid-forming (GFM) control. A generalized modeling framework for hybrid AC/DC networks is first introduced that accounts for converter, control, and network circuit dynamics and arbitrary network topologies. This modeling framework is applied to low-voltage networks to analyze the performance of dual-port grid-forming (GFM) control. The results demonstrate that active damping by dual-port GFM control is effective at improving the transient response and mitigating oscillations. In contrast, the steady-state response characteristics can be adjusted independently with minimal impact on damping characteristics. The dynamic model and results are validated through hardware experiments for three prototypical system architectures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that low-voltage DC distribution interfaced by AC/DC converters using dual-port GFM control, can serve both as the sole interconnection between AC distribution systems and in parallel to an AC connection, thereby enhancing the operational flexibility of low- and medium-voltage distribution networks.

Title: Large-Scale Self-Powered Vibration Control: Theory and Experiment
Authors: Connor Ligeikis, Heath Hofmann, Jeff Scruggs
Abstract: A self-powered system is a control technology that powers itself by harvesting energy from exogenous disturbances. This article details the design and experimental validation of a prototype self-powered vibration control system, for larger-scale applications (i.e., power flows above 1W and forces on the order of 1kN.) The prototype consists of a linear ballscrew coupled with a permanent-magnet synchronous machine. A custom three-phase inverter is used to control power flow, and a custom half-bridge DC-DC power converter is used to facilitate power flow to and from a storage capacitor. Due to parasitics in the control hardware, feedback laws for self-powered systems must adhere to a feasibility condition tighter than mere passivity. This article implements a tractable control design approach that accounts for this feasibility constraint. The control design is validated via hardware-in-the-loop experiments pertaining to a stochastically-excited tuned vibration absorber.

Title: Resistor Hopping KLJN Noise Communication Using Small Bias Voltages Supported by ML and Optimum Threshold-Based Detectors
Authors: Hadi Zayyani, Felipe A. P. de Figueiredo, Mohammad Salman, Rausley A. A. de Souza
Abstract: In this paper, a Resistor Hopping (RH) scheme with the addition of biases is proposed for secure Kirchhoff Law Johnson-Noise (KLJN) communication. The RH approach enables us to increase the bit rate of secure communication between Alice and Bob, while also ensuring that the inherent unconditional security of KLJN is satisfied. The biases are added to the proposed scheme to better distinguish between Gaussian distributed noises in terms of their means, rather than just using variances. Throughout the paper, we strive to minimize biases to achieve a power-efficient scheme. For the detection part of the proposed algorithm, a Maximum-Likelihood (ML) detector is derived. The separability condition of Gaussian distributions is investigated, along with the provision of a threshold-based detector that offers both simple and optimal thresholds in terms of minimizing the error probability. Some analysis of the proposed RH-KLJN communication scheme is provided, including Physical Layer Security (PLS) equations. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed scheme over the classical KLJN scheme, offering a higher data rate and lower bit error probability at the expense of increased complexity.

Title: A Generalized Framework for Quadratic Noise Modulation Using Non-Gaussian Distributions
Authors: Hadi Zayyani, Mohammad Salman, Felipe A. P. de Figueiredo, Rausley A. A. de Souza
Abstract: This letter generalizes noise modulation by introducing two voltage biases and employing non-Gaussian noise distributions, such as Mixture of Gaussian (MoG) and Laplacian, in addition to traditional Gaussian noise. The proposed framework doubles the data rate by enabling discrimination in both the mean and variance of transmitted noise symbols. This novel modulation scheme is referred to as Generalized Quadratic Noise Modulation (GQNM). Closed-form expressions for the Bit Error Probability (BEP) are derived for the Generalized Gaussian (GG) and Gaussian Mixture of Two Gaussians (GMoTG) cases. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the generalized modulation scheme, particularly under non-Gaussian noise assumptions, highlighting its potential for enhanced performance in low-power and secure communication systems.

Title: Solving ill-conditioned polynomial equations using score-based priors with application to multi-target detection
Authors: Rafi Beinhorn, Shay Kreymer, Amnon Balanov, Michael Cohen, Alon Zabatani, Tamir Bendory
Abstract: Recovering signals from low-order moments is a fundamental yet notoriously difficult task in inverse problems. This recovery process often reduces to solving ill-conditioned systems of polynomial equations. In this work, we propose a new framework that integrates score-based diffusion priors with moment-based estimators to regularize and solve these nonlinear inverse problems. This introduces a new role for generative models: stabilizing polynomial recovery from noisy statistical features. As a concrete application, we study the multi-target detection (MTD) model in the high-noise regime. We demonstrate two main results: (i) diffusion priors substantially improve recovery from third-order moments, and (ii) they make the super-resolution MTD problem, otherwise ill-posed, feasible. Numerical experiments on MNIST data confirm consistent gains in reconstruction accuracy across SNR levels. Our results suggest a promising new direction for combining generative priors with nonlinear polynomial inverse problems.

Title: Knowledge Distillation for Sensing-Assisted Long-Term Beam Tracking in mmWave Communications
Authors: Mengyuan Ma, Nhan Thanh Nguyen, Nir Shlezinger, Yonina C. Eldar, A. Lee Swindlehurst, Markku Juntti
Abstract: Infrastructure-mounted sensors can capture rich environmental information to enhance communications and facilitate beamforming in millimeter-wave systems. This work presents an efficient sensing-assisted long-term beam tracking framework that selects optimal beams from a codebook for current and multiple future time slots. We first design a large attention-enhanced neural network (NN) to fully exploit past visual observations for beam tracking. A convolutional NN extracts compact image features, while gated recurrent units with attention capture the temporal dependencies within sequences. The large NN then acts as the teacher to guide the training of a lightweight student NN via knowledge distillation. The student requires shorter input sequences yet preserves long-term beam prediction ability. Numerical results demonstrate that the teacher achieves Top-5 accuracies exceeding 93% for current and six future time slots, approaching state-of-the-art performance with a 90% complexity reduction. The student closely matches the teacher's performance while cutting complexity by another 90%, despite operating with 60% shorter input sequences. This improvement significantly enhances data efficiency, reduces latency, and lowers power consumption in sensing and processing.

Title: A Goal-Oriented Approach for Active Object Detection with Exploration-Exploitation Balance
Authors: Yalei Yu, Matthew Coombes, Wen-Hua Chen, Cong Sun, Myles Flanagan, Jingjing Jiang, Pramod Pashupathy, Masoud Sotoodeh-Bahraini, Peter Kinnell, Niels Lohse
Abstract: Active object detection, which aims to identify objects of interest through controlled camera movements, plays a pivotal role in real-world visual perception for autonomous robotic applications, such as manufacturing tasks (e.g., assembly operations) performed in unknown environments. A dual control for exploration and exploitation (DCEE) algorithm is presented within goal-oriented control systems to achieve efficient active object detection, leveraging active learning by incorporating variance-based uncertainty estimation in the cost function. This novel method employs an exploration-exploitation balanced cost function to actively guide the selection of the next viewpoint. Specifically, active object detection is achieved through the development of a reward function that encodes knowledge about the confidence variation of objects as a function of viewpoint position within a given domain. By identifying the unknown parameters of this function, the system generates an optimal viewpoint planning strategy. DCEE integrates parameter estimation of the reward function and view planning, ensuring a balanced trade-off between the exploitation of learned knowledge and active exploration during the planning process. Moreover, it demonstrates remarkable adaptability across diverse scenarios, effectively handling LEGO brick detection at varying locations. Importantly, the algorithm maintains consistent configuration settings and a fixed number of parameters across various scenarios, underscoring its efficiency and robustness. To validate the proposed approach, extensive numerical studies, high-fidelity virtual simulations, and real-world experiments under various scenarios were conducted. The results confirm the effectiveness of DCEE in active object detection, showcasing superior performance compared to existing methods, including model predictive control (MPC) and entropy approaches.

Title: Partitioning techniques for non-centralized predictive control: A systematic review and novel theoretical insights
Authors: Alessandro Riccardi, Luca Laurenti, Bart De Schutter
Abstract: The partitioning problem is of central relevance for designing and implementing non-centralized Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategies for large-scale systems. These control approaches include decentralized MPC, distributed MPC, hierarchical MPC, and coalitional MPC. Partitioning a system for the application of non-centralized MPC consists of finding the best definition of the subsystems, and their allocation into groups for the definition of local controllers, to maximize the relevant performance indicators. The present survey proposes a novel systematization of the partitioning approaches in the literature in five main classes: optimization-based, algorithmic, community-detection-based, game-theoretic-oriented, and heuristic approaches. A unified graph-theoretical formalism, a mathematical re-formulation of the problem in terms of mixed-integer programming, the novel concepts of predictive partitioning and multi-topological representations, and a methodological formulation of quality metrics are developed to support the classification and further developments of the field. We analyze the different classes of partitioning techniques, and we present an overview of their strengths and limitations, which include a technical discussion about the different approaches. Representative case studies are discussed to illustrate the application of partitioning techniques for non-centralized MPC in various sectors, including power systems, water networks, wind farms, chemical processes, transportation systems, communication networks, industrial automation, smart buildings, and cyber-physical systems. An outlook of future challenges completes the survey.

Title: Dynamic Length FSK Waveforms for Joint Communications and Radar
Authors: Tian Han, Peter J Smith, Urbashi Mitra, Jamie S Evans, Robin Evans, Rajitha Senanayake
Abstract: Motivated by the constant modulus property of frequency shift keying (FSK) based waveforms and the stabilisation of its radar performance with an increase in the number of subpulses, in this paper an FSK-based dynamic subpulse number joint communications and radar waveform design is proposed. From a communications point of view, the system operates based on traditional FSK modulation. From a sensing point of view, although the subpulses are continuously generated and transmitted, radar waveforms are dynamically formed by monitoring the flatness of the spectrum which in turn guarantees the accuracy of the delay estimation. Other constraints on the waveform length are used to ensure satisfactory values of the root mean square time duration, ambiguity function sidelobe levels and prevent overly long waveforms. To provide an estimation of the probability of generating extremely long waveforms, the distribution of the number of subpulses is approximated using a Brownian motion process and an existing result on its one-sided exit density. Numerical examples are provided to evaluate the accuracy of the approximate distribution, as well as the ambiguity function sidelobe levels and the delay and Doppler shift estimation performance of the transmitted waveforms.

Title: Radio Frequency Amplitude-Modulation to Frequency-Modulation Signal Converter
Authors: Rishab Parthasarathy, Michael Popik, Noah Haefner
Abstract: In this project, we wanted to discover an analog topology that could effectively convert amplitude-modulated (AM) signals to frequency-modulated (FM) signals, while also ensuring that both sets of signals were within their respective radio frequency (RF) bands. To that end, an effective topology for doing so was developed, characterized, and demonstrated, requiring the ability to de-modulate incoming signals from the AM radio band--spanning from 530 kHz to 1700 kHz--and re-modulate these signals into the FM radio band--spanning from 88 MHz to 108 MHz. These bands are separated by roughly 86 MHz, presenting the need for the topology to radically alter the incoming frequency before re-broadcasting. At its simplest implementation, this required an AM demodulation circuit coupled to a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO). Together, these two circuits translated variations in the incoming envelope signal to variations in the output frequency while still maintaining high-fidelity audio, similar to how existing radio receiving and broadcasting are done. Altogether, the project not only developed a working system but also provided valuable instruction in the design, analysis, and construction of effective RF circuits--invaluable to future endeavors within analog electronics.

Title: Cooperative UAV-mounted RISs-assisted Energy-efficient Communications
Authors: Hongyang Pan, Yanheng Liu, Geng Sun, Qingqing Wu, Tierui Gong, Pengfei Wang, Dusit Niyato, Chau Yuen
Abstract: Cooperative reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are promising technologies for 6G networks to support a great number of users. Compared with the fixed RISs, the properly deployed RISs may improve the communication performance with less communication energy consumption, thereby improving the energy efficiency. In this paper, we consider a cooperative unmanned aerial vehicle-mounted RISs (UAV-RISs)-assisted cellular network, where multiple RISs are carried and enhanced by UAVs to serve multiple ground users (GUs) simultaneously such that achieving the three-dimensional (3D) mobility and opportunistic deployment. Specifically, we formulate an energy-efficient communication problem based on multi-objective optimization framework (EEComm-MOF) to jointly consider the beamforming vector of base station (BS), the location deployment and the discrete phase shifts of UAV-RIS system so as to simultaneously maximize the minimum available rate over all GUs, maximize the total available rate of all GUs, and minimize the total energy consumption of the system, while the transmit power constraint of BS is considered. To comprehensively solve EEComm-MOF which is an NP-hard and non-convex problem with constraints, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II with a continuous solution processing mechanism, a discrete solution processing mechanism, and a complex solution processing mechanism (INSGA-II-CDC) is proposed. Simulations results demonstrate that the proposed INSGA-II-CDC can solve EEComm-MOF effectively and outperforms other benchmarks under different parameter settings. Moreover, the stability of INSGA-II-CDC and the effectiveness of the improved mechanisms are verified. Finally, the implementability analysis of the algorithm is given.

Title: Simplified Design Approach for Via Transitions up to 67 GHz
Authors: Giorgi Tsintsadze, Reza Vahdani, James L. Drewniak, Richard Zai
Abstract: A systematic approach for high-speed via transition design is proposed. The effects of via barrel radius, anti-pad size, and the distance from adjacent stitching (GND) vias on bandwidth are analyzed and characterized. Guidelines for selecting parameter values are provided and validated by correlating 3D full-wave FEM simulation results with actual measurements of the coupon board. When a sufficient number of stitching vias are used, the via structure can be approximated as a coaxial transmission line. The proposed methodology builds on this approximation and also considers high-order modes. With this framework, engineers can easily optimize design parameters while intuitively understanding how geometry affects bandwidth. This approach also allows engineers with limited access to expensive and computationally intensive 3D FEM tools to design high bandwidth vias up to 67 GHz.

Title: Stacked Intelligent Metasurface for End-to-End OFDM System
Authors: Yida Zhang, Qiuyan Liu, Hongtao Luo, Yuqi Xia, Qiang Wang
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) and dual-polarized SIM (DPSIM) enabled wave-domain signal processing have emerged as promising research directions for offloading baseband digital processing tasks and efficiently simplifying transceiver design. However, existing architectures are limited to employing SIM (DPSIM) for a single communication function, such as precoding or combining. To further enhance the overall performance of SIM (DPSIM)-assisted systems and achieve end-to-end (E2E) joint optimization from the transmitted bitstream to the received bitstream, we propose an SIM (DPSIM)- assisted E2E orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system, where traditional communication tasks such as modulation, precoding, combining, and demodulation are performed simultaneously during electromagnetic (EM) forward propagation. Furthermore, inspired by the idea of abstracting real metasurfaces as hidden layers of a neural network, we propose the electromagnetic neural network (EMNN) to enable the control of the E2E OFDM communication system. In addition, transfer learning is introduced into the model training, and a training and deployment framework for the EMNN is designed. Simulation results demonstrate that both SIM-assisted E2E OFDM systems and DPSIM-assisted E2E OFDM systems can achieve robust bitstream transmission under complex channel conditions. Our study highlights the application potential of EMNN and SIM (DPSIM)-assisted E2E OFDM systems in the design of next-generation transceivers.

Title: RadioLAM: A Large AI Model for Fine-Grained 3D Radio Map Estimation
Authors: Zhiyuan Liu, Qingyu Liu, Shuhang Zhang, Hongliang Zhang, Lingyang Song
Abstract: A radio map captures the spatial distribution of wireless channel parameters, such as the strength of the signal received, across a geographic area. The problem of fine-grained three-dimensional (3D) radio map estimation involves inferring a high-resolution radio map for the two-dimensional (2D) area at an arbitrary target height within a 3D region of interest, using radio samples collected by sensors sparsely distributed in that 3D region. Solutions to the problem are crucial for efficient spectrum management in 3D spaces, particularly for drones in the rapidly developing low-altitude economy. However, this problem is challenging due to ultra-sparse sampling, where the number of collected radio samples is far fewer than the desired resolution of the radio map to be estimated. In this paper, we design a Large Artificial Intelligence Model (LAM) called RadioLAM for the problem. RadioLAM employs the creative power and the strong generalization capability of LAM to address the ultra-sparse sampling challenge. It consists of three key blocks: 1) an augmentation block, using the radio propagation model to project the radio samples collected at different heights to the 2D area at the target height; 2) a generation block, leveraging an LAM under an Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to generate a candidate set of fine-grained radio maps for the target 2D area; and 3) an election block, utilizing the radio propagation model as a guide to find the best map from the candidate set. Extensive simulations show that RadioLAM is able to solve the fine-grained 3D radio map estimation problem efficiently from an ultra-low sampling rate of 0.1%, and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art.

Title: Model Predictive Control with High-Probability Safety Guarantee for Nonlinear Stochastic Systems
Authors: Zishun Liu, Liqian Ma, Yongxin Chen
Abstract: We present a model predictive control (MPC) framework for nonlinear stochastic systems that ensures safety guarantee with high probability. Unlike most existing stochastic MPC schemes, our method adopts a set-erosion that converts the probabilistic safety constraint into a tractable deterministic safety constraint on a smaller safe set over deterministic dynamics. As a result, our method is compatible with any off-the-shelf deterministic MPC algorithm. The key to the effectiveness of our method is a tight bound on the stochastic fluctuation of a stochastic trajectory around its nominal version. Our method is scalable and can guarantee safety with high probability level (e.g., 99.99%), making it particularly suitable for safety-critical applications involving complex nonlinear dynamics. Rigorous analysis is conducted to establish a theoretical safety guarantee, and numerical experiments are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed MPC method.

Title: Low-Altitude Wireless Networks: A Survey

Abstract: The rapid development of the low-altitude economy has imposed unprecedented demands on wireless infrastructure to accommodate large-scale drone deployments and facilitate intelligent services in dynamic airspace environments. However, unlocking its full potential in practical applications presents significant challenges. Traditional aerial systems predominantly focus on air-ground communication services, often neglecting the integration of sensing, computation, control, and energy-delivering functions, which hinders the ability to meet diverse mission-critical demands. Besides, the absence of systematic low-altitude airspace planning and management exacerbates issues regarding dynamic interference in three-dimensional space, coverage instability, and scalability. To overcome these challenges, a comprehensive framework, termed low-altitude wireless network (LAWN), has emerged to seamlessly integrate communication, sensing, computation, control, and air traffic management into a unified design. This article provides a comprehensive overview of LAWN systems, introducing LAWN system fundamentals and the evolution of functional designs. Subsequently, we delve into performance evaluation metrics and review critical concerns surrounding privacy and security in the open-air network environment. Finally, we present the cutting-edge developments in airspace structuring and air traffic management, providing insights to facilitate the practical deployment of LAWNs.

Title: $ε$-Optimal Multi-Agent Patrol using Recurrent Strategy
Authors: Deepak Mallya, Arpita Sinha, Leena Vachhani
Abstract: The multi-agent patrol problem refers to repeatedly visiting different locations in an environment using multiple autonomous agents. For over two decades, researchers have studied this problem in various settings. While providing valuable insights into the problem, the works in existing literature have not commented on the nature of the optimal solutions to the problem. We first show that an $\epsilon$-approximate recurrent patrol strategy exists for every feasible patrol strategy. Then, we establish the existence of a recurrent patrol strategy that is an $\epsilon$-optimal solution to the General Patrol Problem. The factor $\epsilon$ is proportional to the discretisation constant $D$, which can be arbitrarily small and is independent of the number of patrol agents and the size of the environment. This result holds for a variety of problem formulations already studied. We also provide an algorithmic approach to determine an $\epsilon$-approximate recurrent patrol strategy for a patrol strategy created by any method from the literature. We perform extensive simulations in graphs based on real-life environments to validate the claims made in this work.

Title: EMeRALDS: Electronic Medical Record Driven Automated Lung Nodule Detection and Classification in Thoracic CT Images
Authors: Hafza Eman, Furqan Shaukat, Muhammad Hamza Zafar, Syed Muhammad Anwar
Abstract: Objective: Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, primarily due to delayed diagnosis and poor early detection. This study aims to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) for the accurate detection and classification of pulmonary nodules in computed tomography (CT) scans. Methods: We propose an end-to-end CAD pipeline consisting of two modules: (i) a detection module (CADe) based on the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), in which the standard visual prompt is replaced with a text prompt encoded by CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining), and (ii) a diagnosis module (CADx) that calculates similarity scores between segmented nodules and radiomic features. To add clinical context, synthetic electronic medical records (EMRs) were generated using radiomic assessments by expert radiologists and combined with similarity scores for final classification. The method was tested on the publicly available LIDC-IDRI dataset (1,018 CT scans). Results: The proposed approach demonstrated strong performance in zero-shot lung nodule analysis. The CADe module achieved a Dice score of 0.92 and an IoU of 0.85 for nodule segmentation. The CADx module attained a specificity of 0.97 for malignancy classification, surpassing existing fully supervised methods. Conclusions: The integration of VLMs with radiomics and synthetic EMRs allows for accurate and clinically relevant CAD of pulmonary nodules in CT scans. The proposed system shows strong potential to enhance early lung cancer detection, increase diagnostic confidence, and improve patient management in routine clinical workflows.

Title: Attention-Enhanced Learning for Sensing-Assisted Long-Term Beam Tracking in mmWave Communications
Authors: Mengyuan Ma, Nhan Thanh Nguyen, Nir Shlezinger, Yonina C. Eldar, Markku Juntti
Abstract: Beam training and prediction in millimeter-wave communications are highly challenging due to fast time-varying channels and sensitivity to blockages and mobility. In this context, infrastructure-mounted cameras can capture rich environmental information that can facilitate beam tracking design. In this work, we develop an efficient attention-enhanced machine learning model for long-term beam tracking built upon convolutional neural networks and gated recurrent units to predict both current and future beams from past observed images. The integrated temporal attention mechanism substantially improves its predictive performance. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed design achieves Top-5 beam prediction accuracies exceeding 90% across both current and six future time slots, significantly reducing overhead arising from sensing and processing for beam training. It further attains 97% of state-of-the-art performance with only 3% of the computational complexity.

Title: Impact of a Sharpness Based Loss Function for Removing Out-of-Focus Blur
Authors: Uditangshu Aurangabadkar, Darren Ramsook, Anil Kokaram
Abstract: Recent research has explored complex loss functions for deblurring. In this work, we explore the impact of a previously introduced loss function - Q which explicitly addresses sharpness and employ it to fine-tune State-of-the-Art (SOTA) deblurring models. Standard image quality metrics such as PSNR or SSIM do not distinguish sharpness from ringing. Therefore, we propose a novel full-reference image quality metric Omega that combines PSNR with Q. This metric is sensitive to ringing artefacts, but not to a slight increase in sharpness, thus making it a fair metric for comparing restorations from deblurring mechanisms. Our approach shows an increase of 15 percent in sharpness (Q) and up to 10 percent in Omega over the use of standard losses.

Title: EyeNexus: Adaptive Gaze-Driven Quality and Bitrate Streaming for Seamless VR Cloud Gaming Experiences
Authors: Ze Wu, Ahmad Alhilal, Yuk Hang Tsui, Matti Siekkinen, Pan Hui
Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) cloud gaming systems render the 3D graphics on cloud servers for playing graphically demanding games on VR headsets. Delivering high-resolution game scenes is challenging due to variation in network performance. By leveraging the non-uniform human vision perception, foveated rendering and encoding have proven effective for optimized streaming in constrained networks. SoTA foveation methods either do not incorporate real-time gaze data or are unable to handle variations in network conditions, resulting in a suboptimal user experience. We introduce EyeNexus, a pioneering system that combines real-time gaze-driven spatial compression (FSC) with gaze-driven video encoding (FVE), transforming the gaze point for precise alignment and foveation. We propose a novel foveation model that dynamically adjusts the foveation region based on real-time bandwidth and gaze data. The model simplifies network-aware quality assignment in FVE, ensuring smooth and imperceptible quality gradients. We evaluate EyeNexus using objective and subjective measures with different network conditions and games. EyeNexus reduces latency by up to 70.9% and improves perceptual visual quality by up to 24.6%. Our IRB-approved user study shows that EyeNexus achieves the highest playability and visual quality, with improvements of up to 48%, while eliminating motion sickness.

Title: Continuous-Time Distributed Learning for Collective Wisdom Maximization
Authors: Luka Baković, Giacomo Como, Fabio Fagnani, Anton Proskurnikov, Emma Tegling
Abstract: Motivated by the well established idea that collective wisdom is greater than that of an individual, we propose a novel learning dynamics as a sort of companion to the Abelson model of opinion dynamics. Agents are assumed to make independent guesses about the true state of the world after which they engage in opinion exchange leading to consensus. We investigate the problem of finding the optimal parameters for this exchange, e.g. those that minimize the variance of the consensus value. Specifically, the parameter we examine is susceptibility to opinion change. We propose a dynamics for distributed learning of the optimal parameters and analytically show that it converges for all relevant initial conditions by linking to well established results from consensus theory. Lastly, a numerical example provides intuition on both system behavior and our proof methods.

Title: Varying Horizon Learning Economic MPC With Unknown Costs of Disturbed Nonlinear Systems
Authors: Weiliang Xiong, Defeng He, Haiping Du, Jianbin Mu
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel varying horizon economic model predictive control (EMPC) scheme without terminal constraints for constrained nonlinear systems with additive disturbances and unknown economic costs. The general regression learning framework with mixed kernels is first used to reconstruct the unknown cost. Then an online iterative procedure is developed to adjust the horizon adaptively. Again, an elegant horizon-dependent contraction constraint is designed to ensure the convergence of the closed-loop system to a neighborhood of the desired steady state. Moreover, sufficient conditions ensuring recursive feasibility and input-to-state stability are established for the system in closed-loop with the EMPC. The merits of the proposed scheme are verified by the simulations of a continuous stirred tank reactor and a four-tank system in terms of robustness, economic performance and online computational burden.

Title: High Effort, Low Gain: Fundamental Limits of Active Learning for Linear Dynamical Systems
Authors: Nicolas Chatzikiriakos, Kevin Jamieson, Andrea Iannelli
Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of identifying an unknown linear dynamical system given a finite hypothesis class. In particular, we analyze the effect of the excitation input on the sample complexity of identifying the true system with high probability. To this end, we present sample complexity lower bounds that capture the choice of the selected excitation input. The sample complexity lower bound gives rise to a system theoretic condition to determine the potential benefit of experiment design. Informed by the analysis of the sample complexity lower bound, we propose a persistent excitation (PE) condition tailored to the considered setting, which we then use to establish sample complexity upper bounds. Notably, the \acs{PE} condition is weaker than in the case of an infinite hypothesis class and allows analyzing different excitation inputs modularly. Crucially, the lower and upper bounds share the same dependency on key problem parameters. Finally, we leverage these insights to propose an active learning algorithm that sequentially excites the system optimally with respect to the current estimate, and provide sample complexity guarantees for the presented algorithm. Concluding simulations showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Title: Distributed Finite-Horizon Optimal Control for Consensus with Differential Privacy Guarantees
Authors: Yuwen Ma, Yongqiang Wang, Sarah K. Spurgeon, Boli Chen
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of privacy-preserving consensus control for multi-agent systems (MAS) using differential privacy. We propose a novel distributed finite-horizon linear quadratic regulator (LQR) framework, in which agents share individual state information while preserving the confidentiality of their local pairwise weight matrices, which are considered sensitive data in MAS. Protecting these matrices effectively safeguards each agent's private cost function and control preferences. Our solution injects consensus error-dependent Laplace noise into the communicated state information and employs a carefully designed time-dependent scaling factor in the local cost functions. {This approach guarantees bounded consensus and achieves rigorous $\epsilon$-differential privacy for the weight matrices without relying on specific noise distribution assumptions.} Additionally, we analytically characterize the trade-off between consensus accuracy and privacy level, offering clear guidelines on how to enhance consensus performance through appropriate scaling of the LQR weight matrices and the privacy budget.

Title: Multi-Stage Location Optimization Through Power Delay Profile Alignment Using Site-Specific Wireless Ray Tracing
Authors: Mingjun Ying, Peijie Ma, Dipankar Shakya, Theodore S. Rappaport
Abstract: Ray tracing (RT) simulations require accurate transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) location information from real-world measurements to accurately characterize wireless propagation behavior in an environment. Such wireless propagation measurements typically employ GPS-based logging for TX/RX locations, which can produce meter-level errors that lead to unreliable RT calibration and validation. These location misalignments cause inaccurate interactions between RT-generated multipath components (MPCs) and the modeled 3D environment, which lead to erroneous channel predictions, and severe discrepancies between simulated and measured power delay profiles (PDPs) and channel characteristics. Moreover, the same RT-generated PDPs using inaccurate locations result in calibration errors when adjusting material properties such as conductivity and permittivity. This paper presents a systematic multi-stage TX/RX location calibration framework to correct location errors and consequently align measured and simulated omnidirectional PDPs. Optimization is performed using a computationally efficient multi-stage grid search and the Powell method. Applying the location calibration framework to NYU WIRELESS urban-microcell (UMi) measurements at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz corrected TX/RX location errors of up to 7 m. The framework reduced the composite loss function by 42.3\% for line-of-sight (LOS) and 13.5\% for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. Furthermore, peak power prediction accuracy improved by approximately 1 dB on average. Such improved geometric alignment enables accurate channel prediction, vital for beam management and infrastructure deployment for next-generation wireless networks.

Title: The Filter Echo: A General Tool for Filter Visualisation
Authors: Daniel Gaa, Joachim Weickert, Iva Farag, Özgün Çiçek
Abstract: To select suitable filters for a task or to improve existing filters, a deep understanding of their inner workings is vital. Diffusion echoes, which are space-adaptive impulse responses, are useful to visualise the effect of nonlinear diffusion filters. However, they have received little attention in the literature. There may be two reasons for this: Firstly, the concept was introduced specifically for diffusion filters, which might appear too limited. Secondly, diffusion echoes have large storage requirements, which restricts their practicality. This work addresses both problems. We introduce the filter echo as a generalisation of the diffusion echo and use it for applications beyond adaptive smoothing, such as image inpainting, osmosis, and variational optic flow computation. We provide a framework to visualise and inspect echoes from various filters with different applications. Furthermore, we propose a compression approach for filter echoes, which reduces storage requirements by a factor of 20 to 100.

Title: EEND-SAA: Enrollment-Less Main Speaker Voice Activity Detection Using Self-Attention Attractors
Authors: Wen-Yung Wu, Pei-Chin Hsieh, Tai-Shih Chi
Abstract: Voice activity detection (VAD) is essential in speech-based systems, but traditional methods detect only speech presence without identifying speakers. Target-speaker VAD (TS-VAD) extends this by detecting the speech of a known speaker using a short enrollment utterance, but this assumption fails in open-domain scenarios such as meetings or customer service calls, where the main speaker is unknown. We propose EEND-SAA, an enrollment-less, streaming-compatible framework for main-speaker VAD, which identifies the primary speaker without prior knowledge. Unlike TS-VAD, our method determines the main speaker as the one who talks more steadily and clearly, based on speech continuity and volume. We build our model on EEND using two self-attention attractors in a Transformer and apply causal masking for real-time use. Experiments on multi-speaker LibriSpeech mixtures show that EEND-SAA reduces main-speaker DER from 6.63% to 3.61% and improves F1 from 0.9667 to 0.9818 over the SA-EEND baseline, achieving state-of-the-art performance under conditions involving speaker overlap and noise.

Title: Optimized Sparse Network Coverage via L1-norm Minimization
Authors: Souvik Paul, Iván Alexander Morales Sandoval, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu
Abstract: The selection of nodes that can serve as cluster heads, local sinks and gateways is a critical challenge in distributed sensor and communication networks. This paper presents a novel framework for identifying a minimal set of nexus nodes to ensure full network coverage while minimizing cost. By formulating the problem as a convex relaxation of the NP-hard set cover problem, we integrate the graph theoretic centrality measures of node degree and betweenness centrality into a cost function optimized via a relaxed L1-norm minimization. The proposed approach is applicable to static and dynamic network scenarios and does not require location or distance estimation. Through simulations across various graph models and dynamic conditions, it is shown that the method achieves faster execution times (lower complexity) and competitive sparsity compared to classical greedy and genetic algorithms (GA), offering a robust, distributed, and cost-efficient node selection solution.

Title: Data-driven Smile Design: Personalized Dental Aesthetics Outcomes Using Deep Learning
Authors: Marcus Lin, Jennifer Lai
Abstract: A healthy smile plays a significant role in functional as well as esthetic considerations, improving confidence. It is difficult for dental professionals to strike a balance between esthetic requirements and functional requirements. Traditional smile design has had heavy reliance on dentist expertise and used plaster models and hand drawings, raising questions about the outcome for patients. Digital technology, led by Dr. Christian Coachman in 2007, allows photographic and videographic assessments, enabling improved intercommunication among specialists and patients. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and big data have supported analysis of facial features and development of personalized smile designs in the last few years. Outputs are, however, susceptible to practitioner bias or limitations of training data, and may be suboptimal for individual users. The study presented here suggests a comprehensive system integrating AI, big data, and recognition technologies to automate the smile design process so that both experienced and inexperienced dentists can generate pleasing aesthetics with ease. The system has a Facial Feature Extraction Module and an Image Generation Module, serving diverse practitioner and patient needs. User data can be incorporated in future research for design optimization and testing of virtual and augmented reality for real-time previewing. Data gathered can also be employed in aesthetic preference analyses, which can enhance our knowledge of smile design in dental practice.

Title: Meta Fluid Antenna: Architecture Design, Performance Analysis, Experimental Examination
Authors: Baiyang Liu, Jiewei Huang, Tuo Wu, Huan Meng, Fengcheng Mei, Lei Ning, Kai-Kit Wong, Hang Wong, Kin-Fai Tong, Kwai-Man Luk
Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) have recently emerged as a promising solution for sixth-generation (6G) ultra-dense connectivity. These systems utilize dynamic radiating and/or shaping techniques to mitigate interference and improve spectral efficiency without relying on channel state information (CSI). The reported improvements achieved by employing a single dynamically activated radiating position in fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA) are significant. To fully realize the potential of FAMA in multi-user multiplexing, we propose leveraging the unique fast-switching capabilities of a single radio-frequency (RF)-chain meta-fluid antenna structure to achieve multi-activation. This allows for a significantly larger set of independent radiating states without requiring additional signal processing. Simulations demonstrate that multi-activation FAMA enables robust multi-user multiplexing with a higher signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) under various Rayleigh-fading environments compared to other single RF-chain technologies. We further show that the SIR can be optimized within a 15~$\mu s$ timeframe under a multi-user Rayleigh-fading channel, making the proposed scheme highly suitable for fast-changing wireless environments. Verified through the theoretical Jakes' model, full three-dimensional (3D) electromagnetic (EM) simulations and experimental validation, multi-activation FAMA enables effective CSI-free, multi-user communication, offering a scalable solution for high-capacity wireless networks.

Title: Compositional shield synthesis for safe reinforcement learning in partial observability
Authors: Steven Carr, Georgios Bakirtzis, Ufuk Topcu
Abstract: Agents controlled by the output of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms often transition to unsafe states, particularly in uncertain and partially observable environments. Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide a natural setting for studying such scenarios with limited sensing. Shields filter undesirable actions to ensure safe RL by preserving safety requirements in the agents' policy. However, synthesizing holistic shields is computationally expensive in complex deployment scenarios. We propose the compositional synthesis of shields by modeling safety requirements by parts, thereby improving scalability. In particular, problem formulations in the form of POMDPs using RL algorithms illustrate that an RL agent equipped with the resulting compositional shielding, beyond being safe, converges to higher values of expected reward. By using subproblem formulations, we preserve and improve the ability of shielded agents to require fewer training episodes than unshielded agents, especially in sparse-reward settings. Concretely, we find that compositional shield synthesis allows an RL agent to remain safe in environments two orders of magnitude larger than other state-of-the-art model-based approaches.

Title: RadarLLM: Adapting Pretrained Large Language Models for Marine Radar Target Detection with Preference-aware Loss
Authors: Qiying Hu
Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their capacities to capture universal knowledge, making them promising general-purpose optimization solvers for wireless signal processing. Motivated by these findings, we take the first step towards fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs for the effective analysis of radar signal features in marine target detection tasks. Nevertheless, directly fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs on marine target detection tasks tends to suffer from pronounced overfitting, particularly in challenging low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) scenarios. This overfitting primarily stems from the model's tendency to memorize spurious or noisy feature patterns rather than learning discriminative structures that generalize well to unseen data. To address this challenge, we introduce RadarLLM, a novel fine-tuning framework that utilizes an effective preference-aware loss. Unlike conventional training strategies that uniformly optimize all feature tokens, this loss function selectively optimizes different feature patches based on their online evaluated learning values, thus guiding the model to focus on the most generalizable patterns during optimization. We theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of the evaluated learning values by transforming the problem as selecting useful feature tokens. Extensive experiments on real-world marine radar datasets show that 1) the proposed loss function is much better than the original one, with particularly significant gains in challenging low SCR scenarios and 2) RadarLLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse detection scenarios, with particularly notable gains under limited training data conditions.

Title: When marine radar target detection meets pretrained large language models
Authors: Qiying Hu, Linping Zhang, Xueqian Wang, Gang Li, Yu Liu, Xiao-Ping Zhang
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) methods are widely used to extract high-dimensional patterns from the sequence features of radar echo signals. However, conventional DL algorithms face challenges such as redundant feature segments, and constraints from restricted model sizes. To address these issues, we propose a framework that integrates feature preprocessing with large language models (LLMs). Our preprocessing module tokenizes radar sequence features, applies a patch selection algorithm to filter out uninformative segments, and projects the selected patches into embeddings compatible with the feature space of pre-trained LLMs. Leveraging these refined embeddings, we incorporate a pre-trained LLM, fine-tuning only the normalization layers to reduce training burdens while enhancing performance. Experiments on measured datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on supervised learning tests.

Title: Control Analysis and Design for Autonomous Vehicles Subject to Imperfect AI-Based Perception
Authors: Tao Yan, Zheyu Zhang, Jingjing Jiang, Wen-Hua Chen
Abstract: Safety is a critical concern in autonomous vehicle (AV) systems, especially when AI-based sensing and perception modules are involved. However, due to the black box nature of AI algorithms, it makes closed-loop analysis and synthesis particularly challenging, for example, establishing closed-loop stability and ensuring performance, while they are fundamental to AV safety. To approach this difficulty, this paper aims to develop new modeling, analysis, and synthesis tools for AI-based AVs. Inspired by recent developments in perception error models (PEMs), the focus is shifted from directly modeling AI-based perception processes to characterizing the perception errors they produce. Two key classes of AI-induced perception errors are considered: misdetection and measurement noise. These error patterns are modeled using continuous-time Markov chains and Wiener processes, respectively. By means of that, a PEM-augmented driving model is proposed, with which we are able to establish the closed-loop stability for a class of AI-driven AV systems via stochastic calculus. Furthermore, a performance-guaranteed output feedback control synthesis method is presented, which ensures both stability and satisfactory performance. The method is formulated as a convex optimization problem, allowing for efficient numerical solutions. The results are then applied to an adaptive cruise control (ACC) scenario, demonstrating their effectiveness and robustness despite the corrupted and misleading perception.

Title: Design and Optimization of EV Charging Infrastructure with Battery in Commercial Buildings
Authors: Quan Nguyen, Christine Holland, Siddharth Sridhar
Abstract: The installation of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in buildings is inevitable, as states push for increased EV adoption to support decarbonization efforts. This transition could force the need for grid infrastructure upgrades and enhanced controls to support reliable power delivery to end-use loads, and overall economic operation. This paper evaluates strategies that address these needs on two fronts: i) optimal sizing of service transformers and battery energy storage systems (BESS), and ii) optimized coordination between EV charging, BESS operation, and building demand. These strategies are applied to a school campus setting, consisting of building and EV charging loads, to provide an illustration of energy management in commercial buildings with EV fleets. A rolling-window optimization approach is applied to determine i) optimal sizing of the service transformer and BESS and ii) optimal control of EV charging and BESS charge/discharge schedules. The design and control strategies are validated in a 20-year time horizon with an annually increasing number of EVs (buses and vans). In addition, an economic analysis is also carried out to show the costs and benefits of each design as a medium- and long-term investment.

Title: Approaches to Analysis and Design of AI-Based Autonomous Vehicles
Authors: Tao Yan, Zheyu Zhang, Jingjing Jiang, Wen-Hua Chen
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) models are becoming key components in an autonomous vehicle (AV), especially in handling complicated perception tasks. However, closing the loop through AI-based feedback may pose significant risks on reliability of autonomous driving due to very limited understanding about the mechanism of AI-driven perception processes. To overcome it, this paper aims to develop tools for modeling, analysis, and synthesis for a class of AI-based AV; in particular, their closed-loop properties, e.g., stability, robustness, and performance, are rigorously studied in the statistical sense. First, we provide a novel modeling means for the AI-driven perception processes by looking at their error characteristics. Specifically, three fundamental AI-induced perception uncertainties are recognized and modeled by Markov chains, Gaussian processes, and bounded disturbances, respectively. By means of that, the closed-loop stochastic stability (SS) is established in the sense of mean square, and then, an SS control synthesis method is presented within the framework of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Besides the SS properties, the robustness and performance of AI-based AVs are discussed in terms of a stochastic guaranteed cost, and criteria are given to test the robustness level of an AV when in the presence of AI-induced uncertainties. Furthermore, the stochastic optimal guaranteed cost control is investigated, and an efficient design procedure is developed innovatively based on LMI techniques and convex optimization. Finally, to illustrate the effectiveness, the developed results are applied to an example of car following control, along with extensive simulation.

Title: The LLM as a Network Operator: A Vision for Generative AI in the 6G Radio Access Network
Authors: Oluwaseyi Giwa, Michael Adewole, Tobi Awodumila, Pelumi Aderinto
Abstract: The management of future AI-native Next-Generation (NextG) Radio Access Networks (RANs), including 6G and beyond, presents a challenge of immense complexity that exceeds the capabilities of traditional automation. In response, we introduce the concept of the LLM-RAN Operator. In this paradigm, a Large Language Model (LLM) is embedded into the RAN control loop to translate high-level human intents into optimal network actions. Unlike prior empirical studies, we present a formal framework for an LLM-RAN operator that builds on earlier work by making guarantees checkable through an adapter aligned with the Open RAN (O-RAN) standard, separating strategic LLM-driven guidance in the Non-Real-Time (RT) RAN intelligent controller (RIC) from reactive execution in the Near-RT RIC, including a proposition on policy expressiveness and a theorem on convergence to stable fixed points. By framing the problem with mathematical rigor, our work provides the analytical tools to reason about the feasibility and stability of AI-native RAN control. It identifies critical research challenges in safety, real-time performance, and physical-world grounding. This paper aims to bridge the gap between AI theory and wireless systems engineering in the NextG era, aligning with the AI4NextG vision to develop knowledgeable, intent-driven wireless networks that integrate generative AI into the heart of the RAN.

Title: Synergetic Empowerment: Wireless Communications Meets Embodied Intelligence
Authors: Hongtao Liang, Yihe Diao, YuHang Wu, Fuhui Zhou, Qihui Wu
Abstract: Wireless communication is evolving into an agent era, where large-scale agents with inherent embodied intelligence are not just users but active participants. The perfect combination of wireless communication and embodied intelligence can achieve a synergetic empowerment and greatly facilitate the development of agent communication. An overview of this synergetic empowerment is presented, framing it as a co-evolutionary process that transforms wireless communication from a simple utility into the digital nervous system of a collective intelligence, while simultaneously elevating isolated agents into a unified superorganism with emergent capabilities far exceeding individual contributions. Moreover, we elaborate how embodied intelligence and wireless communication mutually benefit each other through the lens of the perception-cognition-execution (PCE) loop, revealing a fundamental duality where each PCE stage both challenges network capacity and creates unprecedented opportunities for system-wide optimization. Furthermore, critical open issues and future research directions are identified.

Title: A Deep Learning Framework for Joint Channel Acquisition and Communication Optimization in Movable Antenna Systems
Authors: Ruizhi Zhang, Yuchen Zhang, Lipeng Zhu, Ying Zhang, Rui Zhang
Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end deep learning framework in a movable antenna (MA)-enabled multiuser communication system. In contrast to the conventional works assuming perfect channel state information (CSI), we address the practical CSI acquisition issue through the design of pilot signals and quantized CSI feedback, and further incorporate the joint optimization of channel estimation, MA placement, and precoding design. The proposed mechanism enables the system to learn an optimized transmission strategy from imperfect channel data, overcoming the limitations of conventional methods that conduct channel estimation and antenna position optimization separately. To balance the performance and overhead, we further extend the proposed framework to optimize the antenna placement based on the statistical CSI. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms traditional benchmarks in terms of achievable sum-rate of users, especially under limited feedback and sparse channel environments. Notably, it achieves a performance comparable to the widely-adopted gradient-based methods with perfect CSI, while maintaining significantly lower CSI feedback overhead. These results highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of learning-based MA system design for future wireless systems.

Title: CAR-BRAINet: Sub-6GHz Aided Spatial Adaptive Beam Prediction with Multi Head Attention for Heterogeneous Vehicular Networks
Authors: Aathira G Menon (1), Prabu Krishnan (1), Shyam Lal (1) ((1) Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK), Surathkal)
Abstract: Heterogeneous Vehicular Networks (HetVNets) play a key role by stacking different communication technologies such as sub-6GHz, mm-wave and DSRC to meet diverse connectivity needs of 5G/B5G vehicular networks. HetVNet helps address the humongous user demands-but maintaining a steady connection in a highly mobile, real-world conditions remain a challenge. Though there has been ample of studies on beam prediction models a dedicated solution for HetVNets is sparsely explored. Hence, it is the need of the hour to develop a reliable beam prediction solution, specifically for HetVNets. This paper introduces a lightweight deep learning-based solution termed-"CAR-BRAINet" which consists of convolutional neural networks with a powerful multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism. Existing literature on beam prediction is largely studied under a limited, idealised vehicular scenario, often overlooking the real-time complexities and intricacies of vehicular networks. Therefore, this study aims to mimic the complexities of a real-time driving scenario by incorporating key factors such as prominent MAC protocols-3GPP-C-V2X and IEEE 802.11BD, the effect of Doppler shifts under high velocity and varying distance and SNR levels into three high-quality dynamic datasets pertaining to urban, rural and highway vehicular networks. CAR-BRAINet performs effectively across all the vehicular scenarios, demonstrating precise beam prediction with minimal beam overhead and a steady improvement of 17.9422% on the spectral efficiency over the existing methods. Thus, this study justifies the effectiveness of CAR-BRAINet in complex HetVNets, offering promising performance without relying on the location angle and antenna dimensions of the mobile users, and thereby reducing the redundant sensor-latency.

Title: A Service-Oriented Adaptive Hierarchical Incentive Mechanism for Federated Learning
Authors: Jiaxing Cao, Yuzhou Gao, Jiwei Huang
Abstract: Recently, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a novel framework for distributed model training. In FL, the task publisher (TP) releases tasks, and local model owners (LMOs) use their local data to train models. Sometimes, FL suffers from the lack of training data, and thus workers are recruited for gathering data. To this end, this paper proposes an adaptive incentive mechanism from a service-oriented perspective, with the objective of maximizing the utilities of TP, LMOs and workers. Specifically, a Stackelberg game is theoretically established between the LMOs and TP, positioning TP as the leader and the LMOs as followers. An analytical Nash equilibrium solution is derived to maximize their utilities. The interaction between LMOs and workers is formulated by a multi-agent Markov decision process (MAMDP), with the optimal strategy identified via deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Additionally, an Adaptively Searching the Optimal Strategy Algorithm (ASOSA) is designed to stabilize the strategies of each participant and solve the coupling problems. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of the proposed method.

Title: Multimodal Deep Learning for ATCO Command Lifecycle Modeling and Workload Prediction
Authors: Kaizhen Tan
Abstract: Air traffic controllers (ATCOs) issue high-intensity voice commands in dense airspace, where accurate workload modeling is critical for safety and efficiency. This paper proposes a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates structured data, trajectory sequences, and image features to estimate two key parameters in the ATCO command lifecycle: the time offset between a command and the resulting aircraft maneuver, and the command duration. A high-quality dataset was constructed, with maneuver points detected using sliding window and histogram-based methods. A CNN-Transformer ensemble model was developed for accurate, generalizable, and interpretable predictions. By linking trajectories to voice commands, this work offers the first model of its kind to support intelligent command generation and provides practical value for workload assessment, staffing, and scheduling.

Title: MAE-SAM2: Mask Autoencoder-Enhanced SAM2 for Clinical Retinal Vascular Leakage Segmentation
Authors: Xin Xing, Irmak Karaca, Samira Badrloo, Quan Dong Nguyen, Mahadevan Subramaniam
Abstract: We propose MAE-SAM2, a novel foundation model for retinal vascular leakage segmentation on fluorescein angiography images. Due to the small size and dense distribution of the leakage areas, along with the limited availability of labeled clinical data, this presents a significant challenge for segmentation tasks. Our approach integrates a Self-Supervised learning (SSL) strategy, Masked Autoencoder (MAE), with SAM2. In our implementation, we explore different loss functions and conclude a task-specific combined loss. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that MAE-SAM2 outperforms several state-of-the-art models, achieving the highest Dice score and Intersection-over-Union (IoU). Compared to the original SAM2, our model achieves a $5\%$ performance improvement, highlighting the promise of foundation models with self-supervised pretraining in clinical imaging tasks.

Title: Combining Audio and Non-Audio Inputs in Evolved Neural Networks for Ovenbird
Authors: Sergio Poo Hernandez, Vadim Bulitko, Erin Bayne
Abstract: In the last several years the use of neural networks as tools to automate species classification from digital data has increased. This has been due in part to the high classification accuracy of image classification through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In the case of audio data CNN based recognizers are used to automate the classification of species in audio recordings by using information from sound visualization (i.e., spectrograms). It is common for these recognizers to use the spectrogram as their sole input. However, researchers have other non-audio data, such as habitat preferences of a species, phenology, and range information, available that could improve species classification. In this paper we present how a single-species recognizer neural network's accuracy can be improved by using non-audio data as inputs in addition to spectrogram information. We also analyze if the improvements are merely a result of having a neural network with a higher number of parameters instead of combining the two inputs. We find that networks that use the two different inputs have a higher classification accuracy than networks of similar size that use only one of the inputs.

Title: SG-ML: Smart Grid Cyber Range Modelling Language
Authors: Muhammad M. Roomi, Suhail S.M. Hussain, Daisuke Mashima
Abstract: This work provides a detailed specification of the Smart Grid Modelling Language (SG-ML), which is designed for the automated generation of smart grid cyber ranges. SG-ML is defined as a set of XML schemas that describe a smart grid's configuration in both machine-readable and human-friendly ways, thereby bridging the gap between system modelling and automated deployment. Unlike prior ad-hoc approaches to cyber range design, SG-ML provides a unified methodology that integrates both power system and cyber network representations. The SG-ML model can be customized by users to meet specific requirements, such as emulating physical or cyber topologies and configuring network devices. An SG-ML Processor then parses this configured model to instantiate the cyber range environment. The modelling language leverages established standards like the IEC 61850 Substation Configuration Language (SCL) and IEC 61131 PLCopen XML to define power system topology, cyber network topology, and device configurations. This approach allows for the reuse of existing assets, reducing the effort needed to create the SG-ML model. To address gaps not covered by these standards such as attack injection parameters, scenario-specific metadata, and additional network constraints, SG-ML introduces proprietary schemas that complement standard models. Overall, SG-ML enables reproducible, scalable, and automated generation of realistic smart grid cyber ranges for research, training, and security assessment.

Title: Stabilising Lifetime PD Models under Forecast Uncertainty
Authors: Vahab Rostampour
Abstract: Estimating lifetime probabilities of default (PDs) under IFRS~9 and CECL requires projecting point--in--time transition matrices over multiple years. A persistent weakness is that macroeconomic forecast errors compound across horizons, producing unstable and volatile PD term structures. This paper reformulates the problem in a state--space framework and shows that a direct Kalman filter leaves non--vanishing variability. We then introduce an anchored observation model, which incorporates a neutral long--run economic state into the filter. The resulting error dynamics exhibit asymptotic stochastic stability, ensuring convergence in probability of the lifetime PD term structure. Simulation on a synthetic corporate portfolio confirms that anchoring reduces forecast noise and delivers smoother, more interpretable projections.

Title: Reasonable Experiments in Model-Based Systems Engineering
Authors: Johan Cederbladh, Loek Cleophas, Eduard Kamburjan, Lucas Lima, Rakshit Mittal, Hans Vangheluwe
Abstract: With the current trend in Model-Based Systems Engineering towards Digital Engineering and early Validation & Verification, experiments are increasingly used to estimate system parameters and explore design decisions. Managing such experimental configuration metadata and results is of utmost importance in accelerating overall design effort. In particular, we observe it is important to 'intelligent-ly' reuse experiment-related data to save time and effort by not performing potentially superfluous, time-consuming, and resource-intensive experiments. In this work, we present a framework for managing experiments on digital and/or physical assets with a focus on case-based reasoning with domain knowledge to reuse experimental data efficiently by deciding whether an already-performed experiment (or associated answer) can be reused to answer a new (potentially different) question from the engineer/user without having to set up and perform a new experiment. We provide the general architecture for such an experiment manager and validate our approach using an industrial vehicular energy system-design case study.

Title: Large-Scale Network Utility Maximization via GPU-Accelerated Proximal Message Passing
Authors: Akshay Sreekumar, Anthony Degleris, Ram Rajagopal
Abstract: We present a GPU-accelerated proximal message passing algorithm for large-scale network utility maximization (NUM). NUM is a fundamental problem in resource allocation, where resources are allocated across various streams in a network to maximize total utility while respecting link capacity constraints. Our method, a variant of ADMM, requires only sparse matrix-vector multiplies with the link-route matrix and element-wise proximal operator evaluations, enabling fully parallel updates across streams and links. It also supports heterogeneous utility types, including logarithmic utilities common in NUM, and does not assume strict concavity. We implement our method in PyTorch and demonstrate its performance on problems with tens of millions of variables and constraints, achieving 4x to 20x speedups over existing CPU and GPU solvers and solving problem sizes that exhaust the memory of baseline methods. Additionally, we show that our algorithm is robust to congestion and link-capacity degradation. Finally, using a time-expanded transit seat allocation case study, we illustrate how our approach yields interpretable allocations in realistic networks.

Title: Highly Efficient Optimal Control for Lyophilization via Simulation of Discrete/Continuous Mixed-index Differential-algebraic Equations
Authors: Prakitr Srisuma, Richard D. Braatz
Abstract: This article presents a highly efficient optimal control algorithm and policies for lyophilization (also known as freeze drying). The optimal solutions and control policies are derived using an extended version of the simulation-based algorithm, which reformulates the optimal control problem as a hybrid discrete/continuous system of mixed-index differential-algebraic equations and subsequently calculates the optimal control vector via simulation of the resulting DAEs. Our algorithm and control policies are demonstrated via a number of case studies that encompass various lyophilization and optimal control strategies. All the case studies can be solved within less than a second on a normal laptop, regardless of their complexity. The method is several orders of magnitude faster than the traditional optimization-based techniques while giving similar/better accuracy. The proposed algorithm offers an efficient and reliable framework for optimal control of lyophilization, which can also be extended to other similar systems with phase transitions.

Title: A Broadcast Channel Framework for MIMO-OFDM Integrated Sensing and Communication
Authors: Homa Nikbakht, Husheng Li, Zhu Han, H. Vincent Poor
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is expected to be one of the major features of 6G wireless networks. In an ISAC system, communications and sensing functionalities are jointly performed using the same waveform, frequency band and hardware, thereby enabling various use cases such as in cyber physical systems, digital twin and smart cities. A major challenge to the design and analysis of ISAC is a unified framework that incorporates the two distinct functions. By viewing ISAC as a type of broadcast channel, in this paper, we propose a unified ISAC framework in which communication and sensing signals are broadcast to the actual communication users and virtual sensing users. This framework allows the application of existing multiplexing schemes, such as dirty paper coding (DPC) and frequency division multiplexing (FDM) that have been intensively studied in data communications and information theory. Within this framework, we propose different superposition coding schemes, for cases when the sensing waveform is known or unknown to the communication receiver. We propose the waveform optimization algorithms in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) setting accounting for the effects of clutter and Doppler shift. The proposed framework is numerically evaluated for different schemes under various sensing and communications performance metrics.

Title: ViSTR-GP: Online Cyberattack Detection via Vision-to-State Tensor Regression and Gaussian Processes in Automated Robotic Operations
Authors: Navid Aftabi, Philip Samaha, Jin Ma, Long Cheng, Ramy Harik, Dan Li
Abstract: Industrial robotic systems are central to automating smart manufacturing operations. Connected and automated factories face growing cybersecurity risks that can potentially cause interruptions and damages to physical operations. Among these attacks, data-integrity attacks often involve sophisticated exploitation of vulnerabilities that enable an attacker to access and manipulate the operational data and are hence difficult to detect with only existing intrusion detection or model-based detection. This paper addresses the challenges in utilizing existing side-channels to detect data-integrity attacks in robotic manufacturing processes by developing an online detection framework, ViSTR-GP, that cross-checks encoder-reported measurements against a vision-based estimate from an overhead camera outside the controller's authority. In this framework, a one-time interactive segmentation initializes SAM-Track to generate per-frame masks. A low-rank tensor-regression surrogate maps each mask to measurements, while a matrix-variate Gaussian process models nominal residuals, capturing temporal structure and cross-joint correlations. A frame-wise test statistic derived from the predictive distribution provides an online detector with interpretable thresholds. We validate the framework on a real-world robotic testbed with synchronized video frame and encoder data, collecting multiple nominal cycles and constructing replay attack scenarios with graded end-effector deviations. Results on the testbed indicate that the proposed framework recovers joint angles accurately and detects data-integrity attacks earlier with more frequent alarms than all baselines. These improvements are most evident in the most subtle attacks. These results show that plants can detect data-integrity attacks by adding an independent physical channel, bypassing the controller's authority, without needing complex instrumentation.

Title: Autonomous Close-Proximity Photovoltaic Panel Coating Using a Quadcopter
Authors: Dimitri Jacquemont, Carlo Bosio, Teaya Yang, Ruiqi Zhang, Ozgur Orun, Shuai Li, Reza Alam, Thomas M. Schutzius, Simo A. Makiharju, Mark W. Mueller
Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) panels are becoming increasingly widespread in the domain of renewable energy, and thus, small efficiency gains can have massive effects. Anti-reflective and self-cleaning coatings enhance panel performance but degrade over time, requiring periodic reapplication. Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer a flexible and autonomous way to apply protective coatings more often and at lower cost compared to traditional manual coating methods. In this letter, we propose a quadcopter-based system, equipped with a liquid dispersion mechanism, designed to automate such tasks. The localization stack only uses onboard sensors, relying on visual-inertial odometry and the relative position of the PV panel detected with respect to the quadcopter. The control relies on a model-based controller that accounts for the ground effect and the mass decrease of the quadcopter during liquid dispersion. We validate the autonomy capabilities of our system through extensive indoor and outdoor experiments.

Title: California Wildfire Inventory (CAWFI): An Extensive Dataset for Predictive Techniques based on Artificial Intelligence
Authors: Rohan Tan Bhowmik, Youn Soo Jung, Juan Aguilera, Mary Prunicki, Kari Nadeau
Abstract: Due to climate change and the disruption of ecosystems worldwide, wildfires are increasingly impacting environment, infrastructure, and human lives globally. Additionally, an exacerbating climate crisis means that these losses would continue to grow if preventative measures are not implemented. Though recent advancements in artificial intelligence enable wildfire management techniques, most deployed solutions focus on detecting wildfires after ignition. The development of predictive techniques with high accuracy requires extensive datasets to train machine learning models. This paper presents the California Wildfire Inventory (CAWFI), a wildfire database of over 37 million data points for building and training wildfire prediction solutions, thereby potentially preventing megafires and flash fires by addressing them before they spark. The dataset compiles daily historical California wildfire data from 2012 to 2018 and indicator data from 2012 to 2022. The indicator data consists of leading indicators (meteorological data correlating to wildfire-prone conditions), trailing indicators (environmental data correlating to prior and early wildfire activity), and geological indicators (vegetation and elevation data dictating wildfire risk and spread patterns). CAWFI has already demonstrated success when used to train a spatio-temporal artificial intelligence model, predicting 85.7% of future wildfires larger than 300,000 acres when trained on 2012-2017 indicator data. This dataset is intended to enable wildfire prediction research and solutions as well as set a precedent for future wildfire databases in other regions.

Title: Multi-objective task allocation for electric harvesting robots: a hierarchical route reconstruction approach
Authors: Peng Chen, Jing Liang, Hui Song, Kang-Jia Qiao, Cai-Tong Yue, Kun-Jie Yu, Ponnuthurai Nagaratnam Suganthan, Witold Pedrycz
Abstract: The increasing labor costs in agriculture have accelerated the adoption of multi-robot systems for orchard harvesting. However, efficiently coordinating these systems is challenging due to the complex interplay between makespan and energy consumption, particularly under practical constraints like load-dependent speed variations and battery limitations. This paper defines the multi-objective agricultural multi-electrical-robot task allocation (AMERTA) problem, which systematically incorporates these often-overlooked real-world constraints. To address this problem, we propose a hybrid hierarchical route reconstruction algorithm (HRRA) that integrates several innovative mechanisms, including a hierarchical encoding structure, a dual-phase initialization method, task sequence optimizers, and specialized route reconstruction operators. Extensive experiments on 45 test instances demonstrate HRRA's superior performance against seven state-of-the-art algorithms. Statistical analysis, including the Wilcoxon signed-rank and Friedman tests, empirically validates HRRA's competitiveness and its unique ability to explore previously inaccessible regions of the solution space. In general, this research contributes to the theoretical understanding of multi-robot coordination by offering a novel problem formulation and an effective algorithm, thereby also providing practical insights for agricultural automation.

Title: Maximum diversity, weighting and invariants of time series
Authors: Byungchang So
Abstract: Magnitude, obtained as a special case of Euler characteristic of enriched category, represents a sense of the size of metric spaces and is related to classical notions such as cardinality, dimension, and volume. While the studies have explained the meaning of magnitude from various perspectives, continuity also gives a valuable view of magnitude. Based on established results about continuity of magnitude and maximum diversity, this article focuses on continuity of weighting, a distribution whose totality is magnitude, and its variation corresponding to maximum diversity. Meanwhile, recent studies also illuminated the connection between magnitude and data analysis by applying magnitude theory to point clouds representing the data or the set of model parameters. This article will also provide an application for time series analysis by introducing a new kind of invariants of periodic time series, where the invariance follows directly from the continuity results. As a use-case, a simple machine learning experiment is conducted with real-world data, in which the suggested invariants improved the performance.

Title: WeaveMuse: An Open Agentic System for Multimodal Music Understanding and Generation
Authors: Emmanouil Karystinaios
Abstract: Agentic AI has been standardized in industry as a practical paradigm for coordinating specialized models and tools to solve complex multimodal tasks. In this work, we present WeaveMuse, a multi-agent system for music understanding, symbolic composition, and audio synthesis. Each specialist agent interprets user requests, derives machine-actionable requirements (modalities, formats, constraints), and validates its own outputs, while a manager agent selects and sequences tools, mediates user interaction, and maintains state across turns. The system is extendable and deployable either locally, using quantization and inference strategies to fit diverse hardware budgets, or via the HFApi to preserve free community access to open models. Beyond out-of-the-box use, the system emphasizes controllability and adaptation through constraint schemas, structured decoding, policy-based inference, and parameter-efficient adapters or distilled variants that tailor models to MIR tasks. A central design goal is to facilitate intermodal interaction across text, symbolic notation and visualization, and audio, enabling analysis-synthesis-render loops and addressing cross-format constraints. The framework aims to democratize, implement, and make accessible MIR tools by supporting interchangeable open-source models of various sizes, flexible memory management, and reproducible deployment paths.

Title: Dynamic modeling and simulation of an electric flash clay calcination plant for green cement production
Authors: Nicola Cantisani, Jan Lorenz Svensen, Shanmugam Perumal, John Bagterp Jørgensen
Abstract: We present a novel dynamic model of an electric flash clay calcination plant. Calcined kaolinite-rich clay has been identified as one of the most effective candidates for supplementary cementitious material (SCM), because of its large availability. Calcination of clay is achieved via the dehydroxylation reaction, which does not release CO2 (unlike limestone), but has a considerable energy requirement. The required high temperature can be met by electric resistive heating of the working gas in the plant, that can be powered by renewable energy. Therefore, CO2-free calcination of clay can be achieved. Up to 50\% of the limestone-based clinker can be substituted by calcined clay (CC), making the cement more sustainable. We consider a plant that consists of gas-material cyclones that pre-heat the clay, a calciner, and a gas-recirculation system with electric heating of the gas. The model is formulated as a system of differential-algebraic equations (DAE). The model consists of thermophysical properties, reaction kinetics and stoichiometry, transport, mass and energy balances, and algebraic constraints. The model can be used to perform dynamic simulations with changing inputs, process design, and optimization. Moreover, it can be used to develop model-based control, which is relevant for flexible operation of a clay calcination plant for green cement production.

Title: Comparing Model-based Control Strategies for a Quadruple Tank System: Decentralized PID, LMPC, and NMPC
Authors: Anders H. D. Christensen, Tobias K. S. Ritschel, Jan Lorenz Svensen, Steen Hørsholt, Jakob Kjøbsted Huusom, John Bagterp Jørgensen
Abstract: This paper compares the performance of a decentralized proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, a linear model predictive controller (LMPC), and a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) applied to a quadruple tank system (QTS). We present experimental data from a physical setup of the QTS as well as simulation results. The QTS is modeled as a stochastic nonlinear continuous-discrete-time system, with parameters estimated using a maximum-likelihood prediction-error-method (ML-PEM). The NMPC applies the stochastic nonlinear continuous-discrete-time model, while the LMPC uses a linearized version of the same model. We tune the decentralized PID controller using the simple internal model control (SIMC) rules. The SIMC rules require transfer functions of the process, and we obtain these from the linearized model. We compare the controller performances based on systematic tests using both the physical setup and the simulated QTS. We measure the performance in terms of tracking errors and rate of movement in the manipulated variables. The LMPC and the NMPC perform better than the decentralized PID control system for tracking pre-announced time-varying setpoints. For disturbance rejection, the MPCs perform only slightly better than the decentralized PID controller. The primary advantage of the MPCs is their ability to use the information of future setpoints. We demonstrate this by providing simulation results of the MPCs with and without such information. Finally, the NMPC achieves slightly improved tracking errors compared to the LMPC but at the expense of having a higher input rate of movement.

Title: CORB-Planner: Corridor as Observations for RL Planning in High-Speed Flight
Authors: Yechen Zhang, Bin Gao, Gang Wang, Jian Sun, Zhuo Li
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in a large number of robotic control tasks. Nevertheless, its deployment on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) remains challenging, mainly because of reliance on accurate dynamic models and platform-specific sensing, which hinders cross-platform transfer. This paper presents the CORB-Planner (Corridor-as-Observations for RL B-spline planner), a real-time, RL-based trajectory planning framework for high-speed autonomous UAV flight across heterogeneous platforms. The key idea is to combine B-spline trajectory generation with the RL policy producing successive control points with a compact safe flight corridor (SFC) representation obtained via heuristic search. The SFC abstracts obstacle information in a low-dimensional form, mitigating overfitting to platform-specific details and reducing sensitivity to model inaccuracies. To narrow the sim-to-real gap, we adopt an easy-to-hard progressive training pipeline in simulation. A value-based soft decomposed-critic Q (SDCQ) algorithm is used to learn effective policies within approximately ten minutes of training. Benchmarks in simulation and real-world tests demonstrate real-time planning on lightweight onboard hardware and support maximum flight speeds up to 8.2m/s in dense, cluttered environments without external positioning. Compatibility with various UAV configurations (quadrotors, hexarotors) and modest onboard compute underlines the generality and robustness of CORB-Planner for practical deployment.

Title: Revisiting Meter Tracking in Carnatic Music using Deep Learning Approaches
Authors: Satyajeet Prabhu
Abstract: Beat and downbeat tracking, jointly referred to as Meter Tracking, is a fundamental task in Music Information Retrieval (MIR). Deep learning models have far surpassed traditional signal processing and classical machine learning approaches in this domain, particularly for Western (Eurogenetic) genres, where large annotated datasets are widely available. These systems, however, perform less reliably on underrepresented musical traditions. Carnatic music, a rich tradition from the Indian subcontinent, is renowned for its rhythmic intricacy and unique metrical structures (tālas). The most notable prior work on meter tracking in this context employed probabilistic Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs). The performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning models on Carnatic music, however, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we evaluate two models for meter tracking in Carnatic music: the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), a lightweight architecture that has been successfully adapted for Latin rhythms, and Beat This!, a transformer-based model designed for broad stylistic coverage without the need for post-processing. Replicating the experimental setup of the DBN baseline on the Carnatic Music Rhythm (CMR$_f$) dataset, we systematically assess the performance of these models in a directly comparable setting. We further investigate adaptation strategies, including fine-tuning the models on Carnatic data and the use of musically informed parameters. Results show that while off-the-shelf models do not always outperform the DBN, their performance improves substantially with transfer learning, matching or surpassing the baseline. These findings indicate that SOTA deep learning models can be effectively adapted to underrepresented traditions, paving the way for more inclusive and broadly applicable meter tracking systems.

Title: Introduction to a Low-Cost AI-Powered GUI for Unstained Cell Culture Analysis
Authors: Surajit Das, Pavel Zun
Abstract: This article presents a novel microscopy image analysis framework designed for low-budget labs equipped with a standard CPU desktop. The Python-based program enables cytometric analysis of live, unstained cells in culture through an advanced computer vision and machine learning pipeline. Crucially, the framework operates on label-free data, requiring no manually annotated training data or training phase. It is accessible via a user-friendly, cross-platform GUI that requires no programming skills, while also providing a scripting interface for programmatic control and integration by developers. The end-to-end workflow performs semantic and instance segmentation, feature extraction, analysis, evaluation, and automated report generation. Its modular architecture supports easy maintenance and flexible integration while supporting both single-image and batch processing. Validated on several unstained cell types from the public dataset of livecells, the framework demonstrates superior accuracy and reproducibility compared to contemporary tools like Cellpose and StarDist. Its competitive segmentation speed on a CPU-based platform highlights its significant potential for basic research and clinical applications -- particularly in cell transplantation for personalized medicine and muscle regeneration therapies.

Title: Prioritizing Recurrent Services
Authors: Lin (Franklin)Feng, Yue Hu, Xu Kuang
Abstract: We study optimal scheduling in multi-class queueing systems with reentrance, where jobs may return for additional service after completion. Such reentrance creates feedback loops that fundamentally alter congestion dynamics and challenge classical scheduling results. We model two distinct dimensions of the reentrance behavior, the probability of return and the speed of return, and show that their product, the effective return rate, is the key statistic that governs optimal priorities. Our main result establishes a dichotomy: when the effective return rate of the smaller job class (the class with lower expected total workload) is lower, a fixed priority rule is optimal; when it is higher, fixed rules are suboptimal and the optimal policy must be state dependent. This characterization clarifies how reentrance changes the externalities that jobs impose on one another and provides structural guidance for designing scheduling policies.

Title: Parallel/Distributed Tabu Search for Scheduling Microprocessor Tasks in Hybrid Flowshop
Authors: Adam Janiak, Damian Kowalczyk, Maciej Lichtenstein
Abstract: The paper deals with the makespan minimization in the hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with multiprocessor tasks. The hybrid flow shop (HFS) generalizes the classical flow shop processor configuration by replacing each processor (processing stage) by some number of identical parallel processors. Similarly, the multiprocessor tasks generalize the classical assumption, by allowing a task to require more than one processor simultaneously for its processing. In this work we present the algorithm for solving the problem based on the tabu search technique. The proposed algorithm uses parallel and distributed mechanisms for neighborhood evaluation and well balances heterogeneous network environment.

Title: FuseCodec: Semantic-Contextual Fusion and Supervision for Neural Codecs
Authors: Md Mubtasim Ahasan, Rafat Hasan Khan, Tasnim Mohiuddin, Aman Chadha, Tariq Iqbal, M Ashraful Amin, Amin Ahsan Ali, Md Mofijul Islam, A K M Mahbubur Rahman
Abstract: Speech tokenization enables discrete representation and facilitates speech language modeling. However, existing neural codecs capture low-level acoustic features, overlooking the semantic and contextual cues inherent to human speech. While recent efforts introduced semantic representations from self-supervised speech models or incorporated contextual representations from pre-trained language models, challenges remain in aligning and unifying the semantic and contextual representations. We introduce FuseCodec, which unifies acoustic, semantic, and contextual representations through strong cross-modal alignment and globally informed supervision. We propose three complementary techniques: (i) Latent Representation Fusion, integrating semantic and contextual features directly into the encoder latent space for robust and unified representation learning; (ii) Global Semantic-Contextual Supervision, supervising discrete tokens with globally pooled and broadcasted representations to enhance temporal consistency and cross-modal alignment; and (iii) Temporally Aligned Contextual Supervision, strengthening alignment by dynamically matching contextual and speech tokens within a local window for fine-grained token-level supervision. We further introduce FuseCodec-TTS, demonstrating our methodology's applicability to zero-shot speech synthesis. Empirically, FuseCodec achieves state-of-the-art performance in LibriSpeech, surpassing EnCodec, SpeechTokenizer, and DAC in transcription accuracy, perceptual quality, intelligibility, and speaker similarity. Results highlight the effectiveness of contextually and semantically guided tokenization for speech tokenization and downstream tasks. Code and pretrained models are available at this https URL.

Title: Finite dominating sets for the refueling station location problem in fleet operations
Authors: Moddassir Khan Nayeem, Fuhad Ahmed Opu, Omar Abbaas, Sara Abu-Aridah
Abstract: This study considers a set of routes used by public transportation vehicles and dedicated distribution fleets in a general network. We aim to optimally locate alternative fuel refueling stations in the network to serve these dedicated routes. Deviations from prescribed routes for refueling purposes are allowed. Unlike most related literature, our approach considers all points in the network as candidate refueling station locations. We derive coverage constraints for any candidate location to serve a given route. Then we develop an exact algorithm to establish a finite dominating set (FDS) of candidate locations guaranteed to include an optimal solution to the problem. This set can be used in a mathematical model to minimize the number of stations required to cover all flows in the network. Numerical experiments on realistic networks are presented to illustrate the proposed methodology and to demonstrate its scalability and sensitivity to changes in parameter values.

Title: PaiP: An Operational Aware Interactive Planner for Unknown Cabinet Environments
Authors: Chengjin Wang, Zheng Yan, Yanmin Zhou, Runjie Shen, Zhipeng Wang, Bin Cheng, Bin He
Abstract: Box/cabinet scenarios with stacked objects pose significant challenges for robotic motion due to visual occlusions and constrained free space. Traditional collision-free trajectory planning methods often fail when no collision-free paths exist, and may even lead to catastrophic collisions caused by invisible objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose an operational aware interactive motion planner (PaiP) a real-time closed-loop planning framework utilizing multimodal tactile perception. This framework autonomously infers object interaction features by perceiving motion effects at interaction interfaces. These interaction features are incorporated into grid maps to generate operational cost maps. Building upon this representation, we extend sampling-based planning methods to interactive planning by optimizing both path cost and operational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that PaiP achieves robust motion in narrow spaces.

Title: Scaling to Multimodal and Multichannel Heart Sound Classification: Fine-Tuning Wav2Vec 2.0 with Synthetic and Augmented Biosignals
Authors: Milan Marocchi, Matthew Fynn, Kayapanda Mandana, Yue Rong
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for approximately 17.9 million deaths each year. Early detection is critical, creating a demand for accurate and inexpensive pre-screening methods. Deep learning has recently been applied to classify abnormal heart sounds indicative of CVDs using synchronised phonocardiogram (PCG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, as well as multichannel PCG (mPCG). However, state-of-the-art architectures remain underutilised due to the limited availability of synchronised and multichannel datasets. Augmented datasets and pre-trained models provide a pathway to overcome these limitations, enabling transformer-based architectures to be trained effectively. This work combines traditional signal processing with denoising diffusion models, WaveGrad and DiffWave, to create an augmented dataset to fine-tune a Wav2Vec 2.0-based classifier on multimodal and multichannel heart sound datasets. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the Computing in Cardiology (CinC) 2016 dataset of single channel PCG, accuracy, unweighted average recall (UAR), sensitivity, specificity and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) reach 92.48\%, 93.05\%, 93.63\%, 92.48\%, 94.93\% and 0.8283, respectively. Using the synchronised PCG and ECG signals of the training-a dataset from CinC, 93.14\%, 92.21\%, 94.35\%, 90.10\%, 95.12\% and 0.8380 are achieved for accuracy, UAR, sensitivity, specificity and MCC, respectively. Using a wearable vest dataset consisting of mPCG data, the model achieves 77.13\% accuracy, 74.25\% UAR, 86.47\% sensitivity, 62.04\% specificity, and 0.5082 MCC. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer-based models for CVD detection when supported by augmented datasets, highlighting their potential to advance multimodal and multichannel heart sound classification.

Title: MindVL: Towards Efficient and Effective Training of Multimodal Large Language Models on Ascend NPUs
Authors: Feilong Chen, Yijiang Liu, Yi Huang, Hao Wang, Miren Tian, Ya-Qi Yu, Minghui Liao, Jihao Wu
Abstract: We propose MindVL, a multimodal large langauge model trained on Ascend NPUs. Similar to Qwen2.5-VL, MindVL adopts native-resolution Vision Transformers, which enables it to process images at their original variable resolutions. This design avoids the degradation caused by fixed-resolution tiling while preserving fine-grained details and global layouts, which is crucial for visually dense content such as complex charts and diagrams. To ensure the smooth training of MindVL on Ascend NPUs, we develop Mindspeed-MLLM, a distributed multimodal training framework tailored for Ascend NPUs. To maintain training accuracy, we implement equivalent replacements for certain operators. MindVL undergoes a three-phase training process, namely the warm-up phase, multitask training phase, and supervised instruction tuning phase, to gradually enhance its capabilities. This process starts with basic visual and multimodal pre-training, followed by large-scale multiask trainging and instruction tuning. We also adopt multimodal data packaging and hybrid parallelism techniques, which significantly improve end-to-end training speed. To further boost model performance, we specifically introduce test-time resolution search and model weight averaging. Notably, despite using about 1/10 of the training data required by Qwen2.5-VL, MindVL achieves performance on par with Qwen2.5-VL in evaluations of general multimodal understanding and document/table comprehension. Beyond overall scores, MindVL also delivers leading performance in OCR assessments.

Title: Tensor Invariant Data-Assisted Control and Dynamic Decomposition of Multibody Systems
Authors: Mostafa Eslami, Maryam Babazadeh
Abstract: The control of robotic systems in complex, shared collaborative workspaces presents significant challenges in achieving robust performance and safety when learning from experienced or simulated data is employed in the pipeline. A primary bottleneck is the reliance on coordinate-dependent models, which leads to profound data inefficiency by failing to generalize physical interactions across different frames of reference. This forces learning algorithms to rediscover fundamental physical principles in every new orientation, artificially inflating the complexity of the learning task. This paper introduces a novel framework that synergizes a coordinate-free, unreduced multibody dynamics and kinematics model based on tensor mechanics with a Data-Assisted Control (DAC) architecture. A non-recursive, closed-form Newton-Euler model in an augmented matrix form is derived that is optimized for tensor-based control design. This structure enables a principled decomposition of the system into a structurally certain, physically grounded part and an uncertain, empirical, and interaction-focused part, mediated by a virtual port variable. Then, a complete, end-to-end tensor-invariant pipeline for modeling, control, and learning is proposed. The coordinate-free control laws for the structurally certain part provide a stable and abstract command interface, proven via Lyapunov analysis. Eventually, the model and closed-loop system are validated through simulations. This work provides a naturally ideal input for data-efficient, frame-invariant learning algorithms, such as equivariant learning, designed to learn the uncertain interaction. The synergy directly addresses the data-inefficiency problem, increases explainability and interpretability, and paves the way for more robust and generalizable robotic control in interactive environments.

Title: Room acoustics affect communicative success in hybrid meeting spaces: a pilot study
Authors: Robert Einig, Stefan Janscha, Jonas Schuster, Julian Koch, Martin Hagmueller, Barbara Schuppler
Abstract: Since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, universities and companies have increasingly integrated hybrid features into their meeting spaces, or even created dedicated rooms for this purpose. While the importance of a fast and stable internet connection is often prioritized, the acoustic design of seminar rooms is frequently overlooked. Poor acoustics, particularly excessive reverberation, can lead to issues such as misunderstandings, reduced speech intelligibility or cognitive and vocal fatigue. This pilot study investigates whether room acoustic interventions in a seminar room at Graz University of Technology support better communication in hybrid meetings. For this purpose, we recorded two groups of persons twice, once before and once after improving the acoustics of the room. Our findings -- despite not reaching statistical significance due to the small sample size - indicate clearly that our spatial interventions improve communicative success in hybrid meetings. To make the paper accessible also for readers from the speech communication community, we explain room acoustics background, relevant for the interpretation of our results.

Title: Fundamental limits on taming infectious disease epidemics
Authors: Giovanni Pugliese Carratelli, Xiaodong Cheng, Kris V. Parag, Ioannis Lestas
Abstract: Epidemic control frequently relies on adjusting interventions based on prevalence. But designing such policies is a highly non-trivial problem due to uncertain intervention effects, costs and the difficulty of quantifying key transmission mechanisms and parameters. Here, using exact mathematical and computational methods, we reveal a fundamental limit in epidemic control in that prevalence feedback policies are outperformed by a single optimally chosen constant control level. Specifically, we find no incentive to use prevalence based control under a wide class of cost functions that depend arbitrarily on interventions and scale with infections. We also identify regimes where prevalence feedback is beneficial. Our results challenge the current understanding that prevalence based interventions are required for epidemic control and suggest that, for many classes of epidemics, interventions should not be varied unless the epidemic is near the herd immunity threshold.

Title: WAFER: A new method to retrieve sun-induced fluorescence based on spectral wavelet decompositions
Authors: Veronika Oehl, Alexander Damm
Abstract: Sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) as a close remote sensing based proxy for photosynthesis is accepted as a useful measure to remotely monitor vegetation health and gross primary productivity. In this work we present the new retrieval method WAFER (WAvelet decomposition FluorEscence Retrieval) based on wavelet decompositions of the measured spectra of reflected radiance as well as a reference radiance not containing fluorescence. By comparing absolute absorption line depths by means of the corresponding wavelet coefficients, a relative reflectance is retrieved independently of the fluorescence, i.e. without introducing a coupling between reflectance and fluorescence. The fluorescence can then be derived as the remaining offset. This method can be applied to arbitrary chosen wavelength windows in the whole spectral range, such that all the spectral data available is exploited, including the separation into several frequency (i.e. width of absorption lines) levels and without the need of extensive training datasets. At the same time, the assumptions about the reflectance shape are minimal and no spectral shape assumptions are imposed on the fluorescence, which not only avoids biases arising from wrong or differing fluorescence models across different spatial scales and retrieval methods but also allows for the exploration of this spectral shape for different measurement setups. WAFER is tested on a synthetic dataset as well as several diurnal datasets acquired with a field spectrometer (FloX) over an agricultural site. We compare the WAFER method to two established retrieval methods, namely the improved Fraunhofer line discrimination (iFLD) method and spectral fitting method (SFM) and find a good agreement with the added possibility of exploring the true spectral shape of the offset signal and free choice of the retrieval window.

Title: Convergence Filters for Efficient Economic MPC of Non-dissipative Systems
Authors: Defeng He, Weiliang Xiong, Shiqiang He, Haiping Du
Abstract: This note presents a novel, efficient economic model predictive control (EMPC) scheme for non-dissipative systems subject to state and input constraints. A new conception of convergence filters is defined to address the stability issue of EMPC for constrained non-dissipative systems. Three convergence filters are designed accordingly to be imposed into the receding horizon optimization problem of EMPC. To improve online computational efficiency, the variable horizon idea without terminal constraints is adopted to compromise the convergence speed, economic performance, and computational burden of EMPC. Moreover, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the recursive feasibility and stability of the EMPC. The advantages of the proposed EMPC are validated by a classical non-dissipative continuous stirred-tank reactor.

Title: VH-Diffuser: Variable Horizon Diffusion Planner for Time-Aware Goal-Conditioned Trajectory Planning
Authors: Ruijia Liu, Ancheng Hou, Shaoyuan Li, Xiang Yin
Abstract: Diffusion-based planners have gained significant recent attention for their robustness and performance in long-horizon tasks. However, most existing planners rely on a fixed, pre-specified horizon during both training and inference. This rigidity often produces length-mismatch (trajectories that are too short or too long) and brittle performance across instances with varying geometric or dynamical difficulty. In this paper, we introduce the Variable Horizon Diffuser (VHD) framework, which treats the horizon as a learned variable rather than a fixed hyperparameter. Given a start-goal pair, we first predict an instance-specific horizon using a learned Length Predictor model, which guides a Diffusion Planner to generate a trajectory of the desired length. Our design maintains compatibility with existing diffusion planners by controlling trajectory length through initial noise shaping and training on randomly cropped sub-trajectories, without requiring architectural changes. Empirically, VHD improves success rates and path efficiency in maze-navigation and robot-arm control benchmarks, showing greater robustness to horizon mismatch and unseen lengths, while keeping training simple and offline-only.

Title: Sphere-GAN: a GAN-based Approach for Saliency Estimation in 360° Videos
Authors: Mahmoud Z. A. Wahba, Sara Baldoni, Federica Battisti
Abstract: The recent success of immersive applications is pushing the research community to define new approaches to process 360° images and videos and optimize their transmission. Among these, saliency estimation provides a powerful tool that can be used to identify visually relevant areas and, consequently, adapt processing algorithms. Although saliency estimation has been widely investigated for 2D content, very few algorithms have been proposed for 360° saliency estimation. Towards this goal, we introduce Sphere-GAN, a saliency detection model for 360° videos that leverages a Generative Adversarial Network with spherical convolutions. Extensive experiments were conducted using a public 360° video saliency dataset, and the results demonstrate that Sphere-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art models in accurately predicting saliency maps.

Title: RJD-BASE: Multi-Modal Spectral Clustering via Randomized Joint Diagonalization
Authors: Haoze He, Artemis Pados, Daniel Kressner
Abstract: We revisit the problem of spectral clustering in multimodal settings, where each data modality is encoded as a graph Laplacian. While classical approaches--including joint diagonalization, spectral co-regularization, and multiview clustering--attempt to align embeddings across modalities, they often rely on costly iterative refinement and may fail to directly target the spectral subspace relevant for clustering. In this work, we introduce two key innovations. First, we bring the power of randomization to this setting by sampling random convex combinations of Laplacians as a simple and scalable alternative to explicit eigenspace alignment. Second, we propose a principled selection rule based on Bottom-$k$ Aggregated Spectral Energy (BASE)--a $k$-dimensional extension of the directional smoothness objective from recent minimax formulations--which we uniquely apply as a selection mechanism rather than an optimization target. The result is Randomized Joint Diagonalization with BASE Selection (RJD-BASE), a method that is easily implementable, computationally efficient, aligned with the clustering objective, and grounded in decades of progress in standard eigensolvers. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that RJD-BASE reliably selects high-quality embeddings, outperforming classical multimodal clustering methods at low computational cost.

Title: Early Detection of Branched Broomrape (Phelipanche ramosa) Infestation in Tomato Crops Using Leaf Spectral Analysis and Machine Learning
Authors: Mohammadreza Narimani, Alireza Pourreza, Ali Moghimi, Parastoo Farajpoor, Hamid Jafarbiglu, Mohsen B. Mesgaran
Abstract: Branched broomrape (Phelipanche ramosa) is a chlorophyll-deficient parasitic weed that threatens tomato production by extracting nutrients from the host. We investigate early detection using leaf-level spectral reflectance (400-2500 nm) and ensemble machine learning. In a field experiment in Woodland, California, we tracked 300 tomato plants across growth stages defined by growing degree days (GDD). Leaf reflectance was acquired with a portable spectrometer and preprocessed (band denoising, 1 nm interpolation, Savitzky-Golay smoothing, correlation-based band reduction). Clear class differences were observed near 1500 nm and 2000 nm water absorption features, consistent with reduced leaf water content in infected plants at early stages. An ensemble combining Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM with RBF kernel, and Naive Bayes achieved 89% accuracy at 585 GDD, with recalls of 0.86 (infected) and 0.93 (noninfected). Accuracy declined at later stages (e.g., 69% at 1568 GDD), likely due to senescence and weed interference. Despite the small number of infected plants and environmental confounders, results show that proximal sensing with ensemble learning enables timely detection of broomrape before canopy symptoms are visible, supporting targeted interventions and reduced yield losses.

Title: A Converse Control Lyapunov Theorem for Joint Safety and Stability
Authors: Thanin Quartz, Maxwell Fitzsimmons, Jun Liu
Abstract: We show that the existence of a strictly compatible pair of control Lyapunov and control barrier functions is equivalent to the existence of a single smooth Lyapunov function that certifies both asymptotic stability and safety. This characterization complements existing literature on converse Lyapunov functions by establishing a partial differential equation (PDE) characterization with prescribed boundary conditions on the safe set, ensuring that the safe set is exactly certified by this Lyapunov function. The result also implies that if a safety and stability specification cannot be certified by a single Lyapunov function, then any pair of control Lyapunov and control barrier functions necessarily leads to a conflict and cannot be satisfied simultaneously in a robust sense.

Title: From private to public governance: The case for reconfiguring energy systems as a commons
Authors: Chris Giotitsas, Pedro H. J. Nardelli, Vasilis Kostakis, Arun Narayanan
Abstract: The discussions around the unsustainability of the dominant socio-economic structures have yet to produce solutions to address the escalating problems we face as a species. Such discussions, this paper argues, are hindered by the limited scope of the proposed solutions within a business-as-usual context as well as by the underlying technological rationale upon which these solutions are developed. In this paper, we conceptualize a radical sustainable alternative to the energy conundrum based on an emerging mode of production and a commons-based political economy. We propose a commons-oriented Energy Internet as a potential system for energy production and consumption, which may be better suited to tackle the current issues society faces. We conclude by referring to some of the challenges that the implementation of such a proposal would entail.

Title: ResWCAE: Biometric Pattern Image Denoising Using Residual Wavelet-Conditioned Autoencoder
Authors: Youzhi Liang, Wen Liang
Abstract: The utilization of biometric authentication with pattern images is increasingly popular in compact Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, the reliability of such systems can be compromised by image quality issues, particularly in the presence of high levels of noise. While state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms designed for generic image denoising have shown promise, their large number of parameters and lack of optimization for unique biometric pattern retrieval make them unsuitable for these devices and scenarios. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight and robust deep learning architecture, the Residual Wavelet-Conditioned Convolutional Autoencoder (Res-WCAE) with a Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) regularization, designed specifically for fingerprint image denoising. Res-WCAE comprises two encoders - an image encoder and a wavelet encoder - and one decoder. Residual connections between the image encoder and decoder are leveraged to preserve fine-grained spatial features, where the bottleneck layer conditioned on the compressed representation of features obtained from the wavelet encoder using approximation and detail subimages in the wavelet-transform domain. The effectiveness of Res-WCAE is evaluated against several state-of-the-art denoising methods, and the experimental results demonstrate that Res-WCAE outperforms these methods, particularly for heavily degraded fingerprint images in the presence of high levels of noise. Overall, Res-WCAE shows promise as a solution to the challenges faced by biometric authentication systems in compact IoT devices.

Title: Cooperative Nonlinear Guidance Strategies for Guaranteed Pursuit-Evasion
Authors: Saurabh Kumar, Shashi Ranjan Kumar, Abhinav Sinha
Abstract: This paper investigates a pursuit-evasion problem involving three agents: a pursuer, an evader, and a defender. Cooperative guidance laws are developed for the evader-defender team that guarantee interception of the pursuer by the defender before it reaches the vicinity of the evader. Unlike heuristic methods, optimal control, differential game formulation, and recently proposed time-constrained guidance techniques, a geometry-based solution is proposed to safeguard the evader from the pursuer's incoming threat. The proposed strategy is computationally efficient and expected to be scalable as the number of agents increases. Another notable feature of the proposed strategy is that the evader-defender team does not require knowledge of the pursuer's strategy, yet the pursuer's interception is guaranteed for arbitrary initial engagement geometries. It is further shown that the relevant error variables for the evader-defender team (or individual) converge to zero at a prespecified finite time that can be exactly prescribed prior to the three-body engagement. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative pursuit-evasion strategy is demonstrated through simulations across diverse engagement scenarios.

Title: MIMO Channel Shaping and Rate Maximization Using Beyond-Diagonal RIS
Authors: Yang Zhao, Hongyu Li, Bruno Clerckx, Massimo Franceschetti
Abstract: This paper investigates the limits to which a passive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) can reshape a point-to-point Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channel in terms of singular values and their functions (e.g., achievable rate and harvestable power) for improved wireless performance. We depart from the Diagonal (D) scattering model and adopt a Beyond-Diagonal (BD) model that exploits element-wise connections for passive signal amplitude and phase manipulation. Specifically, analytical tight bounds are derived under typical RIS deployment scenarios to unveil the channel shaping potentials of BD-RIS regarding communication Degrees of Freedom (DoF), singular value spread, power gain, and capacity. An efficient numerical method is then proposed to optimize BD-RIS for any locally Lipschitz function of channel singular values, and showcased to characterize the achievable singular value region. As a side product, we tackle BD-RIS-aided MIMO rate maximization problem by a local-optimal Alternating Optimization (AO) approach and a low-complexity shaping approach. Results show that BD-RIS significantly improves the dynamic range of channel singular values and the tradeoff in manipulating them, thus offering enhanced data rate, harvestable power, and physical-layer security. These advantages become more pronounced when the number of RIS elements, group size, or MIMO dimensions increase. Of particular interest, BD-RIS is shown to activate multi-stream transmission and achieve the asymptotic DoF at much lower transmit power than D-RIS thanks to its proficiency in channel shaping.

Title: The Whole Is Bigger Than the Sum of Its Parts: Modeling Individual Annotators to Capture Emotional Variability
Authors: James Tavernor, Yara El-Tawil, Emily Mower Provost
Abstract: Emotion expression and perception are nuanced, complex, and highly subjective processes. When multiple annotators label emotional data, the resulting labels contain high variability. Most speech emotion recognition tasks address this by averaging annotator labels as ground truth. However, this process omits the nuance of emotion and inter-annotator variability, which are important signals to capture. Previous work has attempted to learn distributions to capture emotion variability, but these methods also lose information about the individual annotators. We address these limitations by learning to predict individual annotators and by introducing a novel method to create distributions from continuous model outputs that permit the learning of emotion distributions during model training. We show that this combined approach can result in emotion distributions that are more accurate than those seen in prior work, in both within- and cross-corpus settings.

Title: Learning-Enabled Iterative Convex Optimization for Safety-Critical Model Predictive Control
Authors: Shuo Liu, Zhe Huang, Jun Zeng, Koushil Sreenath, Calin A. Belta
Abstract: Safety remains a central challenge in control of dynamical systems, particularly when the boundaries of unsafe sets are complex (e.g., nonconvex, nonsmooth) or unknown. This paper proposes a learning-enabled framework for safety-critical Model Predictive Control (MPC) that integrates Discrete-Time High-Order Control Barrier Functions (DHOCBFs) with iterative convex optimization. Unlike existing methods that primarily address CBFs of relative degree one with fully known unsafe set boundaries, our approach generalizes to arbitrary relative degrees and addresses scenarios where the unsafe set boundaries must be inferred. We extract pixel-based data specifically from unsafe set boundaries and train a neural network to approximate local linearizations of these boundaries. The learned models are incorporated into the linearized DHOCBF constraints at each time step, enabling real-time constraint satisfaction within the MPC framework. An iterative convex optimization procedure is developed to accelerate computation while maintaining formal safety guarantees. The benefits of computational performance and safe avoidance of obstacles with diverse shapes are examined and confirmed through numerical results. By bridging model-based control with learning-based environment modeling, this framework advances safe autonomy for discrete-time systems operating in complex and partially known settings.

Title: Reinforcement Learning for Infinite-Dimensional Systems
Authors: Wei Zhang, Jr-Shin Li
Abstract: Interest in reinforcement learning (RL) for large-scale systems, comprising extensive populations of intelligent agents interacting with heterogeneous environments, has surged significantly across diverse scientific domains in recent years. However, the large-scale nature of these systems often leads to high computational costs or reduced performance for most state-of-the-art RL techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RL architecture and derive effective algorithms to learn optimal policies for arbitrarily large systems of agents. In our formulation, we model such systems as parameterized control systems defined on an infinite-dimensional function space. We then develop a moment kernel transform that maps the parameterized system and the value function into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This transformation generates a sequence of finite-dimensional moment representations for the RL problem, organized into a filtrated structure. Leveraging this RL filtration, we develop a hierarchical algorithm for learning optimal policies for the infinite-dimensional parameterized system. To enhance the algorithm's efficiency, we exploit early stopping at each hierarchy, demonstrating the fast convergence property of the algorithm through the construction of a convergent spectral sequence. The performance and efficiency of the proposed algorithm are validated using practical examples in engineering and quantum systems.

Title: Robust Mean Field Social Control: A Unified Reinforcement Learning Framework
Authors: Zhenhui Xu, Jiayu Chen, Bing-Chang Wang, Yuhu Wu, Tielong Shen
Abstract: This paper studies linear quadratic Gaussian robust mean field social control problems in the presence of multiplicative noise. We aim to compute asymptotic decentralized strategies without requiring full prior knowledge of agents' dynamics. The primary challenges lie in solving an indefinite stochastic algebraic Riccati equation for feedback gains, and an indefinite algebraic Riccati equation for feedforward gains. To overcome these challenges, we first propose a unified dual-loop iterative framework that handles both indefinite Riccati-type equations, and provide rigorous convergence proofs for both the outer-loop and inner-loop iterations. Secondly, considering the potential biases arising in the iterative processes due to estimation and modeling errors, we verify the robustness of the proposed algorithm using the small-disturbance input-to-state stability technique. Convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal solution is thus ensured, even in the existence of disturbances. Finally, to relax the limitation of requiring precise knowledge of agents' dynamics, we employ the integral reinforcement learning technique to develop a data-driven method within the dual-loop iterative framework. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Title: YuE: Scaling Open Foundation Models for Long-Form Music Generation

Abstract: We tackle the task of long-form music generation--particularly the challenging \textbf{lyrics-to-song} problem--by introducing YuE, a family of open foundation models based on the LLaMA2 architecture. Specifically, YuE scales to trillions of tokens and generates up to five minutes of music while maintaining lyrical alignment, coherent musical structure, and engaging vocal melodies with appropriate accompaniment. It achieves this through (1) track-decoupled next-token prediction to overcome dense mixture signals, (2) structural progressive conditioning for long-context lyrical alignment, and (3) a multitask, multiphase pre-training recipe to converge and generalize. In addition, we redesign the in-context learning technique for music generation, enabling versatile style transfer (e.g., converting Japanese city pop into an English rap while preserving the original accompaniment) and bidirectional generation. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that YuE matches or even surpasses some of the proprietary systems in musicality and vocal agility. In addition, fine-tuning YuE enables additional controls and enhanced support for tail languages. Furthermore, beyond generation, we show that YuE's learned representations can perform well on music understanding tasks, where the results of YuE match or exceed state-of-the-art methods on the MARBLE benchmark.

Authors: Thomas Sanchez, Vladyslav Zalevskyi, Angeline Mihailov, Gerard Martí-Juan, Elisenda Eixarch, Andras Jakab, Vincent Dunet, Mériam Koob, Guillaume Auzias, Meritxell Bach Cuadra
Abstract: Quality control (QC) has long been considered essential to guarantee the reliability of neuroimaging studies. It is particularly important for fetal brain MRI, where acquisitions and image processing techniques are less standardized than in adult imaging. In this work, we focus on automated quality control of super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) volumes of fetal brain MRI, an important processing step where multiple stacks of thick 2D slices are registered together and combined to build a single, isotropic and artifact-free T2 weighted volume. We propose FetMRQC$_{SR}$, a machine-learning method that extracts more than 100 image quality metrics to predict image quality scores using a random forest model. This approach is well suited to a problem that is high dimensional, with highly heterogeneous data and small datasets. We validate FetMRQC$_{SR}$ in an out-of-domain (OOD) setting and report high performance (ROC AUC = 0.89), even when faced with data from an unknown site or SRR method. We also investigate failure cases and show that they occur in $45\%$ of the images due to ambiguous configurations for which the rating from the expert is arguable. These results are encouraging and illustrate how a non deep learning-based method like FetMRQC$_{SR}$ is well suited to this multifaceted problem. Our tool, along with all the code used to generate, train and evaluate the model are available at this https URL .

Title: M2D-CLAP: Exploring General-purpose Audio-Language Representations Beyond CLAP
Authors: Daisuke Niizumi, Daiki Takeuchi, Masahiro Yasuda, Binh Thien Nguyen, Yasunori Ohishi, Noboru Harada
Abstract: Contrastive language-audio pre-training (CLAP), which learns audio-language representations by aligning audio and text in a common feature space, has become popular for solving audio tasks. However, CLAP's audio features lack generalizability, whereas self-supervised learning (SSL) models offer general-purpose features that perform well across diverse audio tasks. We aim to develop a broadly applicable audio representation and hypothesize that a model that learns both general audio and CLAP features should achieve our goal, which we call a general-purpose audio-language representation. To implement our hypothesis, we propose M2D-CLAP, the first approach to jointly learn effective general audio and CLAP features. It extends an SSL masked modeling duo (M2D) by incorporating CLAP and utilizes LLM-based sentence embeddings. The training process consists of multiple stages. In the first stage, generalizable audio features are pre-trained via a multitask objective combining M2D and CLAP, with CLAP leveraging LLM-based semantic embeddings to distill semantic knowledge into them. In the following stages, CLAP features are pre-trained and refined with guidance from the learned audio features. Experiments demonstrated that M2D-CLAP learns high-performing general audio features (e.g., AudioSet mAP of 49.0, SOTA results in music tasks) and CLAP features, thereby enabling a general-purpose audio-language representation.

Title: Regist3R: Incremental Registration with Stereo Foundation Model
Authors: Sidun Liu, Wenyu Li, Peng Qiao, Yong Dou
Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction has remained an essential yet challenging problem in the field of computer vision. While DUSt3R and its successors have achieved breakthroughs in 3D reconstruction from unposed images, these methods exhibit significant limitations when scaling to multi-view scenarios, including high computational cost and cumulative error induced by global alignment. To address these challenges, we propose Regist3R, a novel stereo foundation model tailored for efficient and scalable incremental reconstruction. Regist3R leverages an incremental reconstruction paradigm, enabling large-scale 3D reconstructions from unordered and many-view image collections. We evaluate Regist3R on public datasets for camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. Our experiments demonstrate that Regist3R achieves comparable performance with optimization-based methods while significantly improving computational efficiency, and outperforms existing multi-view reconstruction models. Furthermore, to assess its performance in real-world applications, we introduce a challenging oblique aerial dataset which has long spatial spans and hundreds of views. The results highlight the effectiveness of Regist3R. We also demonstrate the first attempt to reconstruct large-scale scenes encompassing over thousands of views through pointmap-based foundation models, showcasing its potential for practical applications in large-scale 3D reconstruction tasks, including urban modeling, aerial mapping, and beyond.

Title: BEM-Assisted Low-Complexity Channel Estimation for AFDM Systems over Doubly Selective Channels
Authors: Limin Liu, Zhe Li, Qihao Peng, Qu Luo, Pei Xiao, Haowei Wu
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a low-complexity channel estimation scheme of affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) based on generalized complex exponential basis expansion model (GCE-BEM) over doubly selective channels. The GCE-BEM is used to solve fractional Doppler this http URL, the closed-form expression of channel estimation error is derived for the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation algorithm. Based on the estimated channel, the MMSE detection is adopt to characterize the impacts of estimated channel on bit error rate (BER) by deriving the theoretical lower bound. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme effectively mitigates severe inter-Doppler interference (IDoI). Our theoretical performance analysis can perfectly match the Monte-Carlo results, validating the effectiveness of our proposed channel estimation based on GCE-BEM.

Title: Reducing Object Hallucination in Large Audio-Language Models via Audio-Aware Decoding
Authors: Tzu-wen Hsu, Ke-Han Lu, Cheng-Han Chiang, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) can take audio and text as the inputs and answer questions about the audio. While prior LALMs have shown strong performance on standard benchmarks, there has been alarming evidence that LALMs can hallucinate what is presented in the audio. To mitigate the hallucination of LALMs, we introduce Audio-Aware Decoding (AAD), a lightweight inference-time strategy that uses contrastive decoding to compare the token prediction logits with and without the audio context. By contrastive decoding, AAD promotes the tokens whose probability increases when the audio is present. We conduct our experiment on object hallucination datasets with three LALMs and show that AAD improves the F1 score by 0.046 to 0.428. We also show that AAD can improve the accuracy on general audio QA datasets like Clotho-AQA by 5.4% to 10.3%. We conduct thorough ablation studies to understand the effectiveness of each component in AAD.

Title: Single-shot HDR using conventional image sensor shutter functions and optical randomization
Authors: Xiang Dai, Kyrollos Yanny, Kristina Monakhova, Nicholas Antipa
Abstract: High-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging is an essential technique for overcoming the dynamic range limits of image sensors. The classic method relies on multiple exposures, which slows capture time, resulting in motion artifacts when imaging dynamic scenes. Single-shot HDR imaging alleviates this issue by encoding HDR data into a single exposure, then computationally recovering it. Many established methods use strong image priors to recover improperly exposed image detail. These approaches struggle with extended highlight regions. We utilize the global reset release (GRR) shutter mode of an off-the-shelf sensor. GRR shutter mode applies a longer exposure time to rows closer to the bottom of the sensor. We use optics that relay a randomly permuted (shuffled) image onto the sensor, effectively creating spatially randomized exposures across the scene. The exposure diversity allows us to recover HDR data by solving an optimization problem with a simple total variation image prior. In simulation, we demonstrate that our method outperforms other single-shot methods when many sensor pixels are saturated (10% or more), and is competitive at a modest saturation (1%). Finally, we demonstrate a physical lab prototype that uses an off-the-shelf random fiber bundle for the optical shuffling. The fiber bundle is coupled to a low-cost commercial sensor operating in GRR shutter mode. Our prototype achieves a dynamic range of up to 73dB using an 8-bit sensor with 48dB dynamic range.

Title: Learning from Scratch: Structurally-masked Transformer for Next Generation Lib-free Simulation
Authors: Junlang Huang, Hao Chen, Zhong Guan
Abstract: This paper proposes a neural framework for power and timing prediction of multi-stage data path, distinguishing itself from traditional lib-based analytical methods dependent on driver characterization and load simplifications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first language-based, netlist-aware neural network designed explicitly for standard cells. Our approach employs two pre-trained neural models of waveform prediction and delay estimation that directly infer transient waveforms and propagation delays from SPICE netlists, conditioned on critical physical parameters such as load capacitance, input slew, and gate size. This method accurately captures both intrinsic and coupling-induced delay effects without requiring simplification or interpolation. For multi-stage timing prediction, we implement a recursive propagation strategy where predicted waveforms from each stage feed into subsequent stages, cumulatively capturing delays across the logic chain. This approach ensures precise timing alignment and complete waveform visibility throughout complex signal pathways. The waveform prediction utilizes a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture with netlist-aware node-level encoding, addressing traditional Transformers' fixed input dimensionality constraints. Additionally, specialized subnetworks separately handle primary delay estimation and crosstalk correction. Experimental results demonstrate SPICE-level accuracy, consistently achieving RMSE below 0.0098 across diverse industrial circuits. The proposed framework provides a scalable, structurally adaptable neural alternative to conventional power and timing engines, demonstrating high fidelity to physical circuit behaviors.

Title: On the Equivalence of Koopman Eigenfunctions and Commuting Symmetries
Authors: Xinyuan Jiang, Yan Li
Abstract: The Koopman operator framework offers a way to represent a nonlinear system as a linear one. The key to this simplification lies in the identification of eigenfunctions. While various data-driven algorithms have been developed for this problem, a theoretical characterization of Koopman eigenfunctions from geometric properties of the flow is still missing. This paper provides such a characterization by establishing an equivalence between a set of Koopman eigenfunctions and a set of commuting symmetries -- both assumed to span the tangent spaces at every point on a simply connected open set. Based on this equivalence, we derive an explicit formula for the principal Koopman eigenfunctions and prove its uniform convergence on the region of attraction of a locally asymptotically stable equilibrium point, thereby offering a constructive method for computing Koopman eigenfunctions.

Title: Optimizing Preventive and Reactive Defense Resource Allocation with Uncertain Sensor Signals
Authors: Faezeh Shojaeighadikolaei, Shouhuai Xu, Keith Paarporn
Abstract: Cyber attacks continue to be a cause of concern despite advances in cyber defense techniques. Although cyber attacks cannot be fully prevented, standard decision-making frameworks typically focus on how to prevent them from succeeding, without considering the cost of cleaning up the damages incurred by successful attacks. This motivates us to investigate a new resource allocation problem formulated in this paper: The defender must decide how to split its investment between preventive defenses, which aim to harden nodes from attacks, and reactive defenses, which aim to quickly clean up the compromised nodes. This encounters a challenge imposed by the uncertainty associated with the observation, or sensor signal, whether a node is truly compromised or not; this uncertainty is real because attack detectors are not perfect. We investigate how the quality of sensor signals impacts the defender's strategic investment in the two types of defense, and ultimately the level of security that can be achieved. In particular, we show that the optimal investment in preventive resources increases, and thus reactive resource investment decreases, with higher sensor quality. We also show that the defender's performance improvement, relative to a baseline of no sensors employed, is maximal when the attacker can only achieve low attack success probabilities.

Title: Joint Transmit and Pinching Beamforming Design for Pinching Antenna-assisted Symbiotic Radio
Authors: Ze Wang, Guoping Zhang, Hongbo Xu, Ming Zeng, Fang Fang, Octavia A. Dobre, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel downlink symbiotic radio framework enabled by the pinching antenna system (PASS), designed to enhance both primary and secondary transmissions through reconfigurable antenna positioning. This reconfigurability introduces additional degrees of freedom for adaptive pinching beamforming, thereby enabling constructive signal enhancement and interference suppression tailored to the locations of the backscatter device, the Internet of Things (IoT) receiver, and the primary receivers. To fully exploit these benefits, we formulate a joint transmit and pinching beamforming optimization problem that maximizes the achievable sum rate while satisfying the IoT receiver's detection error probability constraint and feasible deployment constraints for the pinching antennas. The resulting problem is inherently nonconvex and highly coupled. To address this challenge, we develop two complementary solution approaches. The first is a learning-aided gradient descent method, where the constrained optimization is reformulated into a differentiable form and solved through end-to-end learning. In this approach, the pinching antenna position matrix is reparameterized to automatically satisfy minimum spacing constraints, while transmit power and waveguide length limits are enforced via projection and normalization. The second approach is an optimization-based successive convex approximation-particle swarm optimization method, which first determines the transmit beamforming solution using successive convex approximation and subsequently optimizes pinching beamforming via a particle swarm optimization search over candidate pinching antenna placements.

Title: Quantifying the Value of Seismic Structural Health Monitoring for post-earthquake recovery of electric power system in terms of resilience enhancement
Authors: Huangbin Liang, Beatriz Moya, Francisco Chinesta, Eleni Chatzi
Abstract: Post-earthquake recovery of electric power networks (EPNs) is critical to community resilience. Traditional recovery processes often rely on prolonged and imprecise manual inspections for damage diagnosis, leading to suboptimal repair prioritization and extended service disruptions. Seismic Structural Health Monitoring (SSHM) offers the potential to expedite recovery by enabling more accurate and timely damage assessment. However, SSHM deployment incurs costs, and its system-level resilience benefit remains underexplored. This study proposes a probabilistic simulation framework to quantify the value of SSHM for enhancing EPN resilience. The framework includes seismic damage modeling based on network configuration, hazard intensity, fragility functions, and damage-functionality mappings, combined with recovery simulations incorporating resource constraints, repair and transfer durations. System functionality is evaluated using graph-based island detection and optimal power flow analysis. Resilience is quantified via the Lack of Resilience (LoR) metric derived from the functionality restoration curve. SSHM is incorporated by altering the quality of damage information used in repair scheduling. Different monitoring scenarios (e.g., no-SSHM baseline, partial SSHM, full SSHM with various accuracies) are modeled using confusion matrices to simulate damage misclassification. Results show that improved damage awareness via SSHM significantly accelerates recovery and reduces LoR by up to 21%. This work supports evidence-based decisions for SSHM deployment in critical infrastructure.

Title: Low-complexity Leakage Minimization Beamforming for Large-scale Multi-user Cell-Free Massive MIMO
Authors: Iván Alexander Morales Sandoval, Getuar Rexhepi, Kengo Ando, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu
Abstract: We propose a low-complexity beamforming (BF) design for information leakage minimization in multi-user (MU) cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems. Our approach leverages fractional programming (FP) to reformulate the secrecy rate maximization problem into a tractable difference-of-convex form. To efficiently solve the resulting non-convex problem, we employ the Concave-Convex Procedure (CCP), enabling fast convergence to a local optimum. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves secrecy rates comparable to state-of-the-art (SotA) methods, while significantly reducing computational complexity and improving convergence speed.

Title: Comparing Conditional Diffusion Models for Synthesizing Contrast-Enhanced Breast MRI from Pre-Contrast Images
Authors: Sebastian Ibarra, Javier del Riego, Alessandro Catanese, Julian Cuba, Julian Cardona, Nataly Leon, Jonathan Infante, Karim Lekadir, Oliver Diaz, Richard Osuala
Abstract: Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI is essential for breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. However, its reliance on contrast agents introduces safety concerns, contraindications, increased cost, and workflow complexity. To this end, we present pre-contrast conditioned denoising diffusion probabilistic models to synthesize DCE-MRI, introducing, evaluating, and comparing a total of 22 generative model variants in both single-breast and full breast settings. Towards enhancing lesion fidelity, we introduce both tumor-aware loss functions and explicit tumor segmentation mask conditioning. Using a public multicenter dataset and comparing to respective pre-contrast baselines, we observe that subtraction image-based models consistently outperform post-contrast-based models across five complementary evaluation metrics. Apart from assessing the entire image, we also separately evaluate the region of interest, where both tumor-aware losses and segmentation mask inputs improve evaluation metrics. The latter notably enhance qualitative results capturing contrast uptake, albeit assuming access to tumor localization inputs that are not guaranteed to be available in screening settings. A reader study involving 2 radiologists and 4 MRI technologists confirms the high realism of the synthetic images, indicating an emerging clinical potential of generative contrast-enhancement. We share our codebase at this https URL.

Title: From perception to production: how acoustic invariance facilitates articulatory learning in a self-supervised vocal imitation model
Authors: Marvin Lavechin, Thomas Hueber
Abstract: Human infants face a formidable challenge in speech acquisition: mapping extremely variable acoustic inputs into appropriate articulatory movements without explicit instruction. We present a computational model that addresses the acoustic-to-articulatory mapping problem through self-supervised learning. Our model comprises a feature extractor that transforms speech into latent representations, an inverse model that maps these representations to articulatory parameters, and a synthesizer that generates speech outputs. Experiments conducted in both single- and multi-speaker settings reveal that intermediate layers of a pre-trained wav2vec 2.0 model provide optimal representations for articulatory learning, significantly outperforming MFCC features. These representations enable our model to learn articulatory trajectories that correlate with human patterns, discriminate between places of articulation, and produce intelligible speech. Critical to successful articulatory learning are representations that balance phonetic discriminability with speaker invariance -- precisely the characteristics of self-supervised representation learning models. Our findings provide computational evidence consistent with developmental theories proposing that perceptual learning of phonetic categories guides articulatory development, offering insights into how infants might acquire speech production capabilities despite the complex mapping problem they face.

Title: Modeling the Doppler Shift in Cislunar Environment with Gaussian Mixture Models
Authors: Baris Donmez, Sebastien Loranger, Gunes Karabulut Kurt
Abstract: This study investigates the RF-based Doppler shift distribution characterization of the Lunar South Pole (LSP) based inter-satellite link (ISL) in varying inclination. Doppler shift in parts per million (ppm) is determined and analyzed, as it provides an independence from the carrier frequency. Due to unknown relative velocity states duration, the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is found to be the best fitting distribution for ISLs with $1^\circ$ inclination interval Doppler shift with respect to a predetermined satellite. Goodness-of-fit is investigated and quantified with Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and weighted mean relative difference (WMRD) error metrics. Simulation results show that ISL Doppler shifts reach up to $\pm1.89$ ppm as the inclination of the other orbit deviates higher from the reference orbit, inclining $80^\circ$. Regarding the error measurements of GMM fitting, the WMRD and KL divergence metrics for ISL take values up to 0.6575 and 2.2963, respectively.

Title: Joint Spatial and Spectral Hybrid Precoding for Multi-User MIMO-OFDM Systems
Authors: Navid Reyhanian, Reza Ghaderi Zefreh, Parisa Ramezani, Emil Björnson
Abstract: The deployment of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems cannot rely solely on digital precoding due to hardware constraints. Instead, hybrid precoding, which combines digital and radio frequency (RF) techniques, has emerged as a potential alternative. This approach strikes a balance between performance and cost, addressing the limitations of signal mixers and analog-to-digital converters in mmWave systems. mmWave systems are designed to function in wideband channels with frequency selectivity, necessitating the use of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) to mitigate dispersive channels. However, OFDM faces several challenges. First, it suffers from a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) due to the linear combination of subcarriers. Second, it suffers from out-of-band (OOB) emissions due to the sharp spectral transitions of OFDM subcarriers and windowing-induced spectral leakage. Furthermore, phase shifter (PS) impairments at the RF transmitter precoder and the user combiner represent a limitation in practical mmWave systems, leading to phase errors. This work addresses these challenges. We study the problem of robust digital-RF precoding optimization for the downlink sum-rate maximization in hybrid multi-user (MU) MIMO-OFDM systems under maximum transmit power, PAPR, and OOB emission constraints. The formulated maximization problem is non-convex and difficult to solve. We propose a weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) based block coordinate descent (BCD) method to iteratively optimize digital-RF precoders at the transmitter and digital-RF combiners at the users. Low-cost and scalable optimization approaches are proposed to efficiently solve the BCD subproblems. Extensive simulation results are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approaches and exhibit their superiority relative to well-known benchmarks.

Title: Taming Spontaneous Stop-and-Go Traffic Waves: A Computational Mechanism Design Perspective
Authors: Di Shen, Qi Dai, Suzhou Huang, Dimitar Filev
Abstract: It is well known that stop-and-go waves can be generated spontaneously in traffic even without bottlenecks. Can such undesirable traffic patterns, induced by intrinsic human driving behaviors, be tamed effectively and inexpensively? Taking advantage of emerging connectivity and autonomy technologies, we envision a simple yet realistic traffic control system to achieve this goal. To prove the concept, we design such a system to suppress these waves while maximizing traffic throughput in the Tadaki setting: a circular road with varying number of vehicles. We first introduce our driver behavior model and demonstrate how our calibrated human driving agents can closely reproduce the observed human driving patterns in the original Tadaki experiment. We then propose a simple control system mediated via connected automated vehicles (CAV) whose ideal speed parameter is treated as a system-level control variable adapted to the local vehicle density of the traffic. The objective of the control system is set up as a tradeoff: maximizing throughput while minimizing traffic oscillation. Following computational mechanism design, we search for the optimal control policy as a function of vehicle density and the tradeoff attitude parameter. This can be done by letting all vehicles play a simulated game of CAV-modulated traffic under such a control system. Our simulation results show that the improvements in traffic efficiency and smoothness are substantial. Finally, we envision how such a traffic control system can be realized in an environment with smart vehicles connected to a smart infrastructure or via a scheme of variable speed advisory.

Title: Taming Spontaneous Stop-and-Go Traffic Waves: A Bifurcation Perspective of A Dynamical Map
Authors: Suzhou Huang, Jian Hu
Abstract: We consider a discrete-time dynamical system in a car-following context. The system was recently introduced to parsimoniously model human driving behavior based on utility maximization. The parameters of the model were calibrated using vehicle trajectory data from the Sugiyama experiment. It was shown that such a system can accurately reproduce the observed collective phenomena of a more elaborate experiment by Tadaki et al. Once the heterogeneity and noise are switched off, the model defines a map of the corresponding discrete-time dynamical system. We first perform a bifurcation analysis of the map by studying the stability of its limit solutions: a free-flow fixed point and a stop-and-go quasi-periodic orbit. When the vehicle density is varied, our model displays a bifurcation diagram qualitatively similar to those found in a class of optimal velocity models based on an ordinary differential equation approach, including regimes where one or both of the limit solutions are stable. In a 2D bifurcation diagram we further demonstrate that imposing a vehicle density-dependent speed advisory can dissipate the stop-and-go quasi-periodic orbit. This in turn lays the mathematical foundation for a simple, yet effective proposal [1] to tame stop-and-go waves, improving traffic flow and smoothness simultaneously via variable speed advisory.

Title: Realistic UE Antennas for 6G in the 3GPP Channel Model
Authors: Simon Svendsen, Dimitri Gold, Christian Rom, Volker Pauli, Vuokko Nurmela
Abstract: The transition to 6G has driven significant updates to the 3GPP channel model, particularly in modeling UE antennas and user-induced blockage for handheld devices. The 3GPP Rel.19 revision of TR 38.901 introduces a more realistic framework that captures directive antenna patterns, practical antenna placements, polarization effects, and element-specific blockage. These updates are based on high-fidelity simulations and measurements of a reference smartphone across multiple frequency ranges. By aligning link- and system-level simulations with real-world device behavior, the new model enables more accurate evaluation of 6G technologies and supports consistent performance assessment across industry and research.

Title: Terradynamically streamlined shapes in animals and robots enhances traversability through densely cluttered terrain
Authors: Chen Li, Andrew O. Pullin, Duncan W. Haldane, Han K. Lam, Ronald S. Fearing, Robert J. Full
Abstract: Many animals, modern aircraft, and underwater vehicles use streamlined body shapes that reduce fluid dynamic drag to achieve fast and effective locomotion in air and water. Similarly, numerous small terrestrial animals move through cluttered terrain where 3-D, multi-component obstacles like grass, shrubs, vines, and leaf litter resist motion, but it is unknown whether their body shape plays a major role in traversal. Few ground vehicles or terrestrial robots have used body shape to effectively traverse cluttered terrain. Here, we challenged forest-floor-dwelling discoid cockroaches possessing a thin, rounded body to traverse tall, narrowly spaced, vertical, grass-like compliant beams. Animals displayed high traversal performance (79 +/- 12% probability and 3.4 +/- 0.7 s time). Although we observed diverse traversal strategies, cockroaches primarily (48 +/- 9 % probability) used a novel roll maneuver, allowing them to rapidly traverse obstacle gaps narrower than half body width (2.0 +/- 0.5 s traversal time). Reduction of body roundness by addition of artificial shells nearly inhibited roll maneuvers and decreased traversal performance. Inspired by this discovery, we added a thin, rounded exoskeletal shell to a legged robot with a nearly cuboidal body, common to many existing terrestrial robots. Without adding sensory feedback or changing the open-loop control, the rounded shell enabled the robot to traverse beam obstacles with gaps narrower than shell width via body roll. Terradynamically streamlined shapes can reduce terrain resistance and enhance traversability by assisting effective body reorientation via distributed mechanical feedback. Our findings highlight the need to consider body shape to improve robot mobility in real-world terrain often filled with clutter, and to develop better locomotor-ground contact models to understand interaction with complex terrain.

Title: An iterative Jacobi-like algorithm to compute a few sparse approximate eigenvectors
Authors: Cristian Rusu
Abstract: In this paper, we describe a new algorithm that approximates the extreme eigenvalue/eigenvector pairs of a symmetric matrix. The proposed algorithm can be viewed as an extension of the Jacobi eigenvalue method for symmetric matrices diagonalization to the case where we want to approximate just a few extreme eigenvalues/eigenvectors. The method is also particularly well-suited for the computation of sparse approximations of the eigenvectors. In fact, we show that in general, our method provides a trade-off between the sparsity of the computed approximate eigenspaces and their accuracy. We provide theoretical results that show the linear convergence of the proposed method. Finally, we show experimental numerical results for sparse low-rank approximations of random symmetric matrices and show applications to graph Fourier transforms, and the sparse principal component analysis in image classification experiments. These applications are chosen because, in these cases, there is no need to perform the eigenvalue decomposition to high precision to achieve good numerical results.

Title: Data-Induced Interactions of Sparse Sensors Using Statistical Physics
Authors: Andrei A. Klishin, J. Nathan Kutz, Krithika Manohar
Abstract: Large-dimensional empirical data in science and engineering frequently have a low-rank structure and can be represented as a combination of just a few eigenmodes. Because of this structure, we can use just a few spatially localized sensor measurements to reconstruct the full state of a complex system. The quality of this reconstruction, especially in the presence of sensor noise, depends significantly on the spatial configuration of the sensors. Multiple algorithms based on gappy interpolation and QR factorization have been proposed to optimize sensor placement. Here, instead of an algorithm that outputs a single "optimal" sensor configuration, we take a statistical mechanics view to compute the full landscape of sensor interactions induced by the training data. The two key advances of this paper are the recasting of the sensor placement landscape in an Ising model form and a regularized reconstruction that significantly decreases reconstruction error for few sensors. In addition, we provide first uncertainty quantification of the sparse sensing reconstruction and open questions about the shape of reconstruction risk curve. Mapping out these data-induced sensor interactions allows combining them with external selection criteria and anticipating sensor replacement impacts.

Title: CoPlay: Audio-agnostic Cognitive Scaling for Acoustic Sensing
Authors: Yin Li, Bo Liu, Rajalakshmi Nanadakumar
Abstract: Acoustic sensing manifests great potential in various applications that encompass health monitoring, gesture interface and imaging by leveraging the speakers and microphones on smart devices. However, in ongoing research and development in acoustic sensing, one problem is often overlooked: the same speaker, when used concurrently for sensing and other traditional applications (like playing music), could cause interference in both making it impractical to use in the real world. The strong ultrasonic sensing signals mixed with music would overload the speaker's mixer. To confront this issue of overloaded signals, current solutions are clipping or down-scaling, both of which affect the music playback quality and also sensing range and accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose CoPlay, a deep learning based optimization algorithm to cognitively adapt the sensing signal. It can 1) maximize the sensing signal magnitude within the available bandwidth left by the concurrent music to optimize sensing range and accuracy and 2) minimize any consequential frequency distortion that can affect music playback. In this work, we design a deep learning model and test it on common types of sensing signals (sine wave or Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave FMCW) as inputs with various agnostic concurrent music and speech. First, we evaluated the model performance to show the quality of the generated signals. Then we conducted field studies of downstream acoustic sensing tasks in the real world. A study with 12 users proved that respiration monitoring and gesture recognition using our adapted signal achieve similar accuracy as no-concurrent-music scenarios, while clipping or down-scaling manifests worse accuracy. A qualitative study also manifests that the music play quality is not degraded, unlike traditional clipping or down-scaling methods.

Title: Intramuscular microelectrode arrays enable highly-accurate neural decoding of hand movements
Authors: Agnese Grison, Jaime Ibanez Pereda, Silvia Muceli, Aritra Kundu, Farah Baracat, Giacomo Indiveri, Elisa Donati, Dario Farina
Abstract: Decoding the activity of the nervous system is a critical challenge in neuroscience and neural interfacing. In this study, we present a neuromuscular recording system that enables large-scale sampling of muscle activity using microelectrode arrays with over 100 channels embedded in forearm muscles. These arrays captured intramuscular high-density signals that were decoded into patterns of activation of spinal motoneurons. In two healthy participants, we recorded high-density intramuscular activity during single- and multi-digit contractions, revealing distinct motoneuron recruitment patterns specific to each task. Based on these patterns, we achieved perfect classification accuracy (100%) for 12 single- and multi-digit tasks and over 96% accuracy for up to 16 tasks, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art EMG classification methods. This intramuscular high-density system and classification method represent an advancement in neural interfacing, with the potential to improve human-computer interaction and the control of assistive technologies, particularly for replacing or restoring impaired motor function.

Title: Evaluating Automatic Speech Recognition Systems for Korean Meteorological Experts
Authors: ChaeHun Park, Hojun Cho, Jaegul Choo
Abstract: This paper explores integrating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) into natural language query systems to improve weather forecasting efficiency for Korean meteorologists. We address challenges in developing ASR systems for the Korean weather domain, specifically specialized vocabulary and Korean linguistic intricacies. To tackle these issues, we constructed an evaluation dataset of spoken queries recorded by native Korean speakers. Using this dataset, we assessed various configurations of a multilingual ASR model family, identifying performance limitations related to domain-specific terminology. We then implemented a simple text-to-speech-based data augmentation method, which improved the recognition of specialized terms while maintaining general-domain performance. Our contributions include creating a domain-specific dataset, comprehensive ASR model evaluations, and an effective augmentation technique. We believe our work provides a foundation for future advancements in ASR for the Korean weather forecasting domain.

Title: Securing Integrated Sensing and Communication Against a Mobile Adversary: A Stackelberg Game with Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Milad Tatar Mamaghani, Xiangyun Zhou, Nan Yang, A. Lee Swindlehurst
Abstract: In this paper, we study a secure integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system employing a full-duplex base station with sensing capabilities against a mobile proactive adversarial target$\unicode{x2014}$a malicious unmanned aerial vehicle (M-UAV). We develop a game-theoretic model to enhance communication security, radar sensing accuracy, and power efficiency. The interaction between the legitimate network and the mobile adversary is formulated as a non-cooperative Stackelberg game (NSG), where the M-UAV acts as the leader and strategically adjusts its trajectory to improve its eavesdropping ability while conserving power and avoiding obstacles. In response, the legitimate network, acting as the follower, dynamically allocates resources to minimize network power usage while ensuring required secrecy rates and sensing performance. To address this challenging problem, we propose a low-complexity successive convex approximation (SCA) method for network resource optimization combined with a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm for adaptive M-UAV trajectory planning through sequential interactions and learning. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in addressing security challenges of dynamic ISAC systems in 6G, i.e., achieving a Stackelberg equilibrium with robust performance while mitigating the adversary's ability to intercept network signals.

Title: Delay Analysis of 5G HARQ in the Presence of Decoding and Feedback Latencies

Abstract: The growing demand for stringent quality of service (QoS) guarantees in 5G networks requires accurate characterisation of delay performance, often measured using Delay Violation Probability (DVP) for a given target delay. Widely used retransmission schemes like Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) and Hybrid ARQ (HARQ) improve QoS through effective feedback, incremental redundancy (IR), and parallel retransmission processes. However, existing works to quantify the DVP under these retransmission schemes overlook practical aspects such as decoding complexity, feedback delays, and the resulting need for multiple parallel ARQ/HARQ processes that enable packet transmissions without waiting for previous feedback, thus exploiting valuable transmission opportunities. This work proposes a comprehensive multi-server delay model for ARQ/HARQ that incorporates these aspects. Using a finite blocklength error model, we derive closed-form expressions and algorithms for accurate DVP evaluation under realistic 5G configurations aligned with 3GPP standards. Our numerical evaluations demonstrate notable improvements in DVP accuracy over the state-of-the-art, highlight the impact of parameter tuning and resource allocation, and reveal how DVP affects system throughput.

Title: DLF: Extreme Image Compression with Dual-generative Latent Fusion
Authors: Naifu Xue, Zhaoyang Jia, Jiahao Li, Bin Li, Yuan Zhang, Yan Lu
Abstract: Recent studies in extreme image compression have achieved remarkable performance by compressing the tokens from generative tokenizers. However, these methods often prioritize clustering common semantics within the dataset, while overlooking the diverse details of individual objects. Consequently, this results in suboptimal reconstruction fidelity, especially at low bitrates. To address this issue, we introduce a Dual-generative Latent Fusion (DLF) paradigm. DLF decomposes the latent into semantic and detail elements, compressing them through two distinct branches. The semantic branch clusters high-level information into compact tokens, while the detail branch encodes perceptually critical details to enhance the overall fidelity. Additionally, we propose a cross-branch interactive design to reduce redundancy between the two branches, thereby minimizing the overall bit cost. Experimental results demonstrate the impressive reconstruction quality of DLF even below 0.01 bits per pixel (bpp). On the CLIC2020 test set, our method achieves bitrate savings of up to 27.93% on LPIPS and 53.55% on DISTS compared to MS-ILLM. Furthermore, DLF surpasses recent diffusion-based codecs in visual fidelity while maintaining a comparable level of generative realism. Project: this https URL

Title: OSDM-MReg: Multimodal Image Registration based One Step Diffusion Model
Authors: Xiaochen Wei, Weiwei Guo, Wenxian Yu, Feiming Wei, Dongying Li
Abstract: Multimodal remote sensing image registration aligns images from different sensors for data fusion and analysis. However, existing methods often struggle to extract modality-invariant features when faced with large nonlinear radiometric differences, such as those between SAR and optical images. To address these challenges, we propose OSDM-MReg, a novel multimodal image registration framework that bridges the modality gap through image-to-image translation. Specifically, we introduce a one-step unaligned target-guided conditional diffusion model (UTGOS-CDM) to translate source and target images into a unified representation domain. Unlike traditional conditional DDPM that require hundreds of iterative steps for inference, our model incorporates a novel inverse translation objective during training to enable direct prediction of the translated image in a single step at test time, significantly accelerating the registration process. After translation, we design a multimodal multiscale registration network (MM-Reg) that extracts and fuses both unimodal and translated multimodal images using the proposed multimodal fusion strategy, enhancing the robustness and precision of alignment across scales and modalities. Extensive experiments on the OSdataset demonstrate that OSDM-MReg achieves superior registration accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Parametric Reachable Sets Via Controlled Dynamical Embeddings
Authors: Akash Harapanahalli, Samuel Coogan
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new framework for reachable set computation through continuous evolution of a set of parameters and offsets which define a parametope, through the intersection of constraints. This results in a dynamical approach towards nonlinear reachability analysis: a single trajectory of an embedding system provides a parametope reachable set for the original system, and uncertainties are accounted for through continuous parameter evolution. This is dual to most existing computational strategies, which define sets through some combination of generator vectors, and usually discretize the system dynamics. We show how, under some regularity assumptions of the dynamics and the set considered, any desired parameter evolution can be accommodated as long as the offset dynamics are set accordingly, providing a virtual "control input" for reachable set computation. In a special case of the theory, we demonstrate how closing the loop for the parameter dynamics using the adjoint of the linearization results in a desirable first-order cancellation of the original system dynamics. Using interval arithmetic in JAX, we demonstrate the efficiency and utility of reachable parametope computation through two numerical examples.

Title: SonicSieve: Bringing Directional Speech Extraction to Smartphones Using Acoustic Microstructures
Authors: Kuang Yuan, Yifeng Wang, Xiyuxing Zhang, Chengyi Shen, Swarun Kumar, Justin Chan
Abstract: Imagine placing your smartphone on a table in a noisy restaurant and clearly capturing the voices of friends seated around you, or recording a lecturer's voice with clarity in a reverberant auditorium. We introduce SonicSieve, the first intelligent directional speech extraction system for smartphones using a bio-inspired acoustic microstructure. Our passive design embeds directional cues onto incoming speech without any additional electronics. It attaches to the in-line mic of low-cost wired earphones which can be attached to smartphones. We present an end-to-end neural network that processes the raw audio mixtures in real-time on mobile devices. Our results show that SonicSieve achieves a signal quality improvement of 5.0 dB when focusing on a 30° angular region. Additionally, the performance of our system based on only two microphones exceeds that of conventional 5-microphone arrays.

Title: Industrial Energy Disaggregation with Digital Twin-generated Dataset and Efficient Data Augmentation
Authors: Christian Internò, Andrea Castellani, Sebastian Schmitt, Fabio Stella, Barbara Hammer
Abstract: Industrial Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is limited by the scarcity of high-quality datasets and the complex variability of industrial energy consumption patterns. To address data scarcity and privacy issues, we introduce the Synthetic Industrial Dataset for Energy Disaggregation (SIDED), an open-source dataset generated using Digital Twin simulations. SIDED includes three types of industrial facilities across three different geographic locations, capturing diverse appliance behaviors, weather conditions, and load profiles. We also propose the Appliance-Modulated Data Augmentation (AMDA) method, a computationally efficient technique that enhances NILM model generalization by intelligently scaling appliance power contributions based on their relative impact. We show in experiments that NILM models trained with AMDA-augmented data significantly improve the disaggregation of energy consumption of complex industrial appliances like combined heat and power systems. Specifically, in our out-of-sample scenarios, models trained with AMDA achieved a Normalized Disaggregation Error of 0.093, outperforming models trained without data augmentation (0.451) and those trained with random data augmentation (0.290). Data distribution analyses confirm that AMDA effectively aligns training and test data distributions, enhancing model generalization.

Title: Enhancing Resilience Against Jamming Attacks: A Cooperative Anti-Jamming Method Using Direction Estimation
Authors: Amir Mehrabian, Georges Kaddoum
Abstract: The inherent vulnerability of wireless communication necessitates strategies to enhance its security, particularly in the face of jamming attacks. This paper uses the collaborations of multiple sensing nodes (SNs) in the wireless network to present a cooperative anti-jamming approach (CAJ) designed to neutralize the impact of jamming attacks. We propose an eigenvector (EV) method to estimate the direction of the channel vector from pilot symbols. Through our analysis, we demonstrate that with an adequate number of pilot symbols, the performance of the proposed EV method is comparable to the scenario where the perfect channel state information (CSI) is utilized. Both analytical formulas and simulations illustrate the excellent performance of the proposed EV-CAJ under strong jamming signals. Considering severe jamming, the proposed EV-CAJ method exhibits only a 0.7 dB degradation compared to the case without jamming especially when the number of SNs is significantly larger than the number of jamming nodes (JNs). Moreover, the extension of the proposed method can handle multiple jammers at the expense of degrees of freedom (DoF). We also investigate the method's ability to remain robust in fast-fading channels with different coherence times. Our proposed approach demonstrates good resilience, particularly when the ratio of the channel's coherence time to the time frame is small. This is especially important in the case of mobile jammers with large Doppler shifts.

Title: Advanced Hybrid Transformer LSTM Technique with Attention and TS Mixer for Drilling Rate of Penetration Prediction
Authors: Saddam Hussain Khan (Artificial Intelligence Lab, Department of Computer Systems Engineering, University of Engineering and Applied Sciences (UEAS), Swat, Pakistan)
Abstract: Accurate prediction of the Rate of Penetration (ROP) is pivotal for drilling optimization, yet it remains a persistent challenge due to the nonlinear, dynamic, and heterogeneous nature of drilling data. This study introduces a novel hybrid deep learning architecture in which input data are first processed through a customized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture multi-scale temporal dependencies aligned with drilling operational cycles, and the resulting features are subsequently refined by an Enhanced Transformer encoder with drilling-specific positional encodings and real-time optimization. Concurrently, the same input is directed to a Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) block that enables efficient cross-feature modeling of static and categorical attributes such as lithology indices and mud properties. The outputs from the enhanced Transformer and TS-Mixer are concatenated, after which an adaptive attention selectively emphasizes the most informative feature representations for accurate ROP prediction. The proposed framework fuses sequential memory, static feature interactions, global contextual learning, and dynamic feature weighting, providing a comprehensive solution to the heterogeneous and event-driven nature of drilling dynamics. Evaluation on a real-world drilling dataset demonstrates benchmark-leading performance, achieving an Rsqaure of 0.9988 and a MAPE of 1.447%, significantly surpassing standalone and hybrid baselines. Model interpretability is achieved through SHAP and LIME, and comparisons between actual and predicted curves, along with bias checks, confirm the accuracy and fairness of the model across various scenarios. This advanced hybrid approach enables dependable real-time ROP prediction, supporting the development of intelligent, cost-effective drilling optimization systems with significant operational benefits.

Title: Distance Between Stochastic Linear Systems
Authors: Venkatraman Renganathan, Sei Zhen Khong
Abstract: While the existing stochastic control theory is well equipped to handle dynamical systems with stochastic uncertainties, a paradigm shift using distance measure based decision making is required for the effective further exploration of the field. As a first step, a distance measure between two stochastic linear time invariant systems is proposed here, extending the existing distance metrics between deterministic linear dynamical systems. In the frequency domain, the proposed distance measure corresponds to the worst-case point-wise in frequency Wasserstein distance between distributions characterising the uncertainties using inverse stereographic projection on the Riemann sphere. For the time domain setting, the proposed distance corresponds to the gap metric induced type-q Wasserstein distance between the distributions characterising the uncertainty of plant models. Apart from providing lower and upper bounds for the proposed distance measures in both frequency and time domain settings, it is proved that the former never exceeds the latter. The proposed distance measures will facilitate the provision of probabilistic guarantees on system robustness and controller performances.

Title: Spectral and Rhythm Feature Performance Evaluation for Category and Class Level Audio Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
Authors: Friedrich Wolf-Monheim
Abstract: Next to decision tree and k-nearest neighbours algorithms deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used to classify audio data in many domains like music, speech or environmental sounds. To train a specific CNN various spectral and rhythm features like mel-scaled spectrograms, mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), cyclic tempograms, short-time Fourier transform (STFT) chromagrams, constant-Q transform (CQT) chromagrams and chroma energy normalized statistics (CENS) chromagrams can be used as digital image input data for the neural network. The performance of these spectral and rhythm features for audio category level as well as audio class level classification is investigated in detail with a deep CNN and the ESC-50 dataset with 2,000 labeled environmental audio recordings using an end-to-end deep learning pipeline. The evaluated metrics accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score for multiclass classification clearly show that the mel-scaled spectrograms and the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) perform significantly better then the other spectral and rhythm features investigated in this research for audio classification tasks using deep CNNs.
