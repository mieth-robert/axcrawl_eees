Title: Optimized Rolling Allocation of Outages for Damage Assesment
Authors: Hritik Gopal Shah, Catherine Tajmajer, Elli Ntakou
Abstract: Natural disasters often inflict severe damage on distribution grids. Rapid, reliable damage assessment (DA) is essential for storm restoration, yet most optimization work targets repair dispatch after faults are identified. This paper presents a production, rolling horizon DA crew allocation system deployed across multiple U.S. states in Eversource Energy's service territory and used during live storms. The method implements a sequential k-job assignment policy per available crew, executed on a fixed cadence and on operators' control. The objective jointly prioritizes critical facilities and customer impact while controlling travel time on the actual road network via the Google Maps API. A key constraint is the absence of live crew GPS; we infer crew locations from the last confirmed DA site and robustify travel estimates for staleness, yielding stable recommendations without continuous tracking. The operator remains in the loop with controls to limit churn and to publish a feasible plan. Using data from the March 7 New Hampshire storm with 90 moderate outages and seven DA crews, we observe shorter time to first assessment, fewer revisits with reduced distance traveled. To our knowledge, this is among the first multi-state enterprise integrated deployments to treat DA crews as a first-class optimized resource in storm restoration.

Title: Learning-Enabled Elastic Network Topology for Distributed ISAC Service Provisioning
Authors: Jie Chen, Xianbin Wang
Abstract: Conventional mobile networks, including both localized cell-centric and cooperative cell-free networks (CCN/CFN), are built upon rigid network topologies. However, neither architecture is adequate to flexibly support distributed integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) services, due to the increasing difficulty of aligning spatiotemporally distributed heterogeneous service demands with available radio resources. In this paper, we propose an elastic network topology (ENT) for distributed ISAC service provisioning, where multiple co-existing localized CCNs can be dynamically aggregated into CFNs with expanded boundaries for federated network operation. This topology elastically orchestrates localized CCN and federated CFN boundaries to balance signaling overhead and distributed resource utilization, thereby enabling efficient ISAC service provisioning. A two-phase operation protocol is then developed. In Phase I, each CCN autonomously classifies ISAC services as either local or federated and partitions its resources into dedicated and shared segments. In Phase II, each CCN employs its dedicated resources for local ISAC services, while the aggregated CFN consolidates shared resources from its constituent CCNs to cooperatively deliver federated services. Furthermore, we design a utility-to-signaling ratio (USR) to quantify the tradeoff between sensing/communication utility and signaling overhead. Consequently, a USR maximization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the network topology (i.e., service classification and CCN aggregation) and the allocation of dedicated and shared resources. However, this problem is challenging due to its distributed optimization nature and the absence of complete channel state information. To address this problem efficiently, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework with centralized training and decentralized execution.

Title: ASCHOPLEX encounters Dafne: a federated continuous learning project for the generalizability of the Choroid Plexus automatic segmentation
Authors: Valentina Visani, Marco Pinamonti, Valentina Sammassimo, Manuela Moretto, Mattia Veronese, Agnese Tamanti, Francesca Benedetta Pizzini, Massimiliano Calabrese, Marco Castellaro, Francesco Santini
Abstract: The Choroid Plexus (ChP) is a highly vascularized brain structure that plays a critical role in several physiological processes. ASCHOPLEX, a deep learning-based segmentation toolbox with an integrated fine-tuning stage, provides accurate ChP delineations on non-contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans; however, its performance is hindered by inter-dataset variability. This study introduces the first federated incremental learning approach for automated ChP segmentation from 3D T1-weighted brain MRI, by integrating an enhanced version of ASCHOPLEX within the Dafne (Deep Anatomical Federated Network) framework. A comparative evaluation is conducted to assess whether federated incremental learning through Dafne improves model generalizability across heterogeneous imaging conditions, relative to the conventional fine-tuning strategy employed by standalone ASCHOPLEX. The experimental cohort comprises 2,284 subjects, including individuals with Multiple Sclerosis as well as healthy controls, collected from five independent MRI datasets. Results indicate that the fine-tuning strategy provides high performance on homogeneous data (e.g., same MRI sequence, same cohort of subjects), but limited generalizability when the data variability is high (e.g., multiple MRI sequences, multiple and new cohorts of subjects). By contrast, the federated incremental learning variant of ASCHOPLEX constitutes a robust alternative consistently achieving higher generalizability and more stable performance across diverse acquisition settings.

Title: Fixed-time control with prescribed performance for path following of underwater gliders
Authors: Hanzhi Yang, Nina Mahmoudian
Abstract: Underwater gliders are increasingly deployed in challenging missions - such as hurricane-season observations and long-endurance environmental monitoring - where strong currents and turbulence pose significant risks to navigation safety. To address these practical challenges, this paper presents a fixed-time prescribed performance control scheme for the 3D path following of underwater gliders subject to model uncertainties and environmental disturbances. The primary contribution is the integration of a finite-time performance function within a fixed-time control framework. This synthesis ensures that the tracking errors are constrained within prescribed performance bounds and converge to a compact set within a fixed time, independent of initial conditions. A second key contribution is the development of a fixed-time sliding mode disturbance observer that provides accurate finite-time estimation of lumped disturbances, enhancing the system's robustness. Integrated with an iLOS guidance law, the proposed controller enables precise and safe waypoint following. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional sliding mode and prescribed performance controllers in tracking accuracy, convergence speed, and control effort smoothness, validating its efficacy for robust underwater navigation.

Title: X-GridAgent: An LLM-Powered Agentic AI System for Assisting Power Grid Analysis
Authors: Yihan (Logon)Wen, Xin Chen
Abstract: The growing complexity of power system operations has created an urgent need for intelligent, automated tools to support reliable and efficient grid management. Conventional analysis tools often require significant domain expertise and manual effort, which limits their accessibility and adaptability. To address these challenges, this paper presents X-GridAgent, a novel large language model (LLM)-powered agentic AI system designed to automate complex power system analysis through natural language queries. The system integrates domain-specific tools and specialized databases under a three-layer hierarchical architecture comprising planning, coordination, and action layers. This architecture offers high flexibility and adaptability to previously unseen tasks, while providing a modular and extensible framework that can be readily expanded to incorporate new tools, data sources, or analytical capabilities. To further enhance performance, we introduce two novel algorithms: (1) LLM-driven prompt refinement with human feedback, and (2) schema-adaptive hybrid retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for accurate information retrieval from large-scale structured grid datasets. Experimental evaluations across a variety of user queries and power grid cases demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of X-GridAgent in automating interpretable and rigorous power system analysis.

Title: Balancing Decentralized Trust and Physical Evidence: A Blockchain-Physical Layer Co-Design for Real-Time 3D Prioritization in Disaster Zones
Authors: Mohammad Taghi Dabiri, Mazen Hasna, Aiman Erbad, Rula Ammuri, Khalid Qaraqe
Abstract: During disaster response, making rapid and well-informed decisions about which areas require immediate attention can save lives. However, current coordination models often struggle with unreliable data, intentional misinformation, and the breakdown of critical communication infrastructure. A decentralized, vote-based blockchain model offers a compelling substrate for achieving this real-time, trusted coordination. This article explores a blockchain-driven approach to rapidly update a dynamic 3D crisis map based on inputs from users and local sensors. Each node submits a timestamped and geotagged vote to a public ledger, enabling agencies to visualize needs as they emerge. However, ensuring the physical authenticity of these claims demands more than cryptography alone. We propose a dual-layer architecture where mobile UAV verifiers perform physical-layer attestation and issue independent location flags to the blockchain. This dual-signature mechanism fuses immutable digital records with sensory-grounded trust. We analyze core technical and human centric challenges, ranging from spoofing and vote ambiguity to verifier compromise and connectivity loss, and outline layered mitigation strategies and future research directions. As a concrete instantiation, we present a UAV mapping scheme leveraging modulated retro-reflector (MRR) sensors and 3D-aware LoS placement to maximize verifiability under urban occlusion, offering a path toward resilient, trust-anchored crisis coordination.

Title: Towards City-Scale Quantum Timing: Wireless Synchronization via Quantum Hubs
Authors: Mohammad Taghi Dabiri, Mazen Hasna, Rula Ammuri, Saif Al-Kuwari, Khalid Qaraqe
Abstract: This paper presents a novel wireless quantum synchronization framework tailored for city-scale deployment using entangled photon pairs and passive corner cube retroreflector (CCR) arrays. A centralized quantum hub emits entangled photons, directing one toward a target device and the other toward a local reference unit. The target, equipped with a planar CCR array, reflects the incoming photon without active circuitry, enabling secure round-trip quantum measurements for sub-nanosecond synchronization and localization. We develop a comprehensive analytical model that captures key physical-layer phenomena, including Gaussian beam spread, spatial misalignment, atmospheric turbulence, and probabilistic photon generation. A closed-form expression is derived for the single-photon detection probability under Gamma-Gamma fading, and its distribution is used to model photon arrival events and synchronization error. Moreover, we analyze the impact of background photons, SPAD detector jitter, and quantum generation randomness on synchronization accuracy and outage probability. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the analytical models and reveal key trade-offs among beam waist, CCR array size, and background light. The proposed architecture offers a low-power, infrastructure-free solution for secure timing in next-generation smart cities.

Title: The Area Signal-to-Noise Ratio: A Robust Alternative to Peak-Based SNR in Spectroscopic Analysis
Authors: Alex Yu, Huaqing Zhao, Lin Z. Li
Abstract: In spectroscopic analysis, the peak-based signal-to-noise ratio (pSNR) is commonly used but suffers from limitations such as sensitivity to noise spikes and reduced effectiveness for broader peaks. We introduce the area-based signal-to-noise ratio (aSNR) as a robust alternative that integrates the signal over a defined region of interest, reducing noise variance and improving detection for various lineshapes. We used Monte Carlo simulations (n=2,000 trials per condition) to test aSNR on Gaussian, Lorentzian, and Voigt lineshapes. We found that aSNR requires significantly lower amplitudes than pSNR to achieve a 50% detection probability. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves show that aSNR performs better than pSNR at low amplitudes. Our results show that aSNR works especially advantageously for broad peaks and could be extended to volume-based SNR for multidimensional spectra.

Title: QoS- and Physics-Aware Routing in Optical LEO Satellite Networks via Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Mohammad Taghi Dabiri, Rula Ammuri, Mazen Hasna, Khalid Qaraqe
Abstract: Optical inter-satellite links (ISLs) are becoming the principal communication backbone in modern large-scale LEO constellations, offering multi-Gb/s capacity and near speed-of-light latency. However, the extreme sensitivity of optical beams to relative satellite motion, pointing jitter, and rapidly evolving geometry makes routing fundamentally more challenging than in RF-based systems. In particular, intra-plane and inter-plane ISLs exhibit markedly different stability and feasible range profiles, producing a dynamic, partially constrained connectivity structure that must be respected by any physically consistent routing strategy. This paper presents a lightweight geometry- and QoS-aware routing framework for optical LEO networks that incorporates class-dependent feasibility constraints derived from a jitter-aware Gaussian-beam model. These analytically computed thresholds are embedded directly into the time-varying ISL graph and enforced via feasible-action masking in a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent. The proposed method leverages local geometric progress, feasible-neighbor structure, and congestion indicators to select next-hop relays without requiring global recomputation. Simulation results on a Starlink-like constellation show that the learned paths are physically consistent, exploit intra-plane stability, adapt to jitter-limited inter-plane connectivity, and maintain robust end-to-end latency under dynamic topology evolution.

Title: Systemization of Knowledge: Resilience and Fault Tolerance in Cyber-Physical Systems
Authors: Rahul Bulusu
Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) now support critical infrastructure spanning transportation, energy, manufacturing, medical devices, and autonomous robotics. Their defining characteristic is the tight coupling between digital computation and continuous physical dynamics which enables sophisticated autonomy but also creates highly non-linear failure modes. Small disturbances at sensors, firmware, networks, or physical interfaces can propagate through estimation and control pipelines, producing cascading instabilities that defy traditional single-layer reasoning. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) unifies nearly two decades of CPS resilience research into a structured Origin-Layer-Effect (OLE) taxonomy. This taxonomy provides a cross-layer lens for understanding how faults arise, how they propagate, and why unrelated CPS failures often share deep structural similarities. By mapping representative systems including RockDrone, MAYDAY, M2MON, HACMS, Byzantine fault-tolerant control, and learning-based recovery mechanisms onto the taxonomy, we reveal patterns of coverage, persistent blind spots, and recurring pathways of fault amplification. Our analysis identifies four structural gaps that span multiple CPS domains: (1) physical-model manipulation, (2) ML-enabled control without stability guarantees, (3) semantic inconsistencies between formal models and firmware, and (4) inadequate forensic visibility across cyber and physical layers. These insights motivate new directions for resilient CPS design, integrating robust control, runtime monitoring, formal assurance, and system-level visibility.

Title: When Future Communications Shift Toward Narrow Beams: A Forward Looking Survey on Pointing Errors and Alignment Limits
Authors: Meysam Ghanbari, Mohammad Taghi Dabiri, Osamah S. Badarneh, Mazen Hasna, Yazan H. Al-Badarneh, Mustafa K. Alshawaqfeh, Khalid Qaraqe
Abstract: Directional links in free-space optical (FSO), millimeter-wave (mmWave), and terahertz (THz) systems are a cornerstone of emerging 6G networks, yet their reliability is fundamentally limited by pointing errors and misalignment. Existing studies address this impairment using technology-specific definitions, models, and mitigation approaches, which hinders cross-domain comparison and transferable design insight. This survey provides a unified treatment of pointing errors across optical and high frequency wireless communications. We establish consistent terminology and a cross-technology taxonomy of pointing errors, review angular misalignment and statistical distribution models, and analyze their impact on system performance. Mitigation techniques are systematically surveyed with emphasis on optical systems and their connection to underlying pointing error models. The survey further provides a detailed examination of pointing-error effects in orbital angular momentum (OAM) links and quantum optical communications, and surveys the corresponding mitigation approaches tailored to mode-dependent impairments and quantum measurement constraints. The survey also outlines open challenges and future research directions. By consolidating fragmented literature into a coherent framework, this work supports consistent analysis and robust design of next generation directional communication systems.

Title: Accelerating Underground Pumped Hydro Energy Storage Scheduling with Decision-Focused Learning
Authors: Honghui Zheng, Pietro Favaro, Yury Dvorkin, Ján Drgoňa
Abstract: Underground pumped hydro energy storage (UPHES) systems play a critical role in grid-scale energy storage for renewable integration, yet optimal day-ahead scheduling remains computationally prohibitive due to nonlinear turbine performance characteristics and discrete operational modes. This paper presents a decision-focused learning (DFL) framework that addresses the computational-accuracy trade-off in UPHES day-ahead scheduling. The proposed methodology employs neural networks to predict penalty weights that guide recursive linearization, transforming the intractable MINLP into a sequence of convex quadratic programs trained end-to-end via differentiable optimization layers. Case studies across 19 representative Belgian electricity market scenarios demonstrate that the DFL framework effectively navigates the trade-off between solution quality and computation time. As a refinement tool, the framework improves profit by 1.1% over piecewise MIQP baselines. Alternatively, as a real-time scheduler initialized with linear approximations, it achieves a 300-fold speedup (3.87s vs 1205.79s) while maintaining profitability within 3.6% of the piecewise MIQP benchmark. Thus, the presented DFL framework enables flexible prioritization between profit maximization and real-time responsiveness.

Title: Semantic Radio Access Networks: Architecture, State-of-the-Art, and Future Directions
Authors: Rui Meng, Zixuan Huang, Jingshu Yan, Mengying Sun, Yiming Liu, Chenyuan Feng, Xiaodong Xu, Zhidi Zhang, Song Gao, Ping Zhang, Tony Q. S. Quek
Abstract: Radio Access Network (RAN) is a bridge between user devices and the core network in mobile communication systems, responsible for the transmission and reception of wireless signals and air interface management. In recent years, Semantic Communication (SemCom) has represented a transformative communication paradigm that prioritizes meaning-level transmission over conventional bit-level delivery, thus providing improved spectrum efficiency, anti-interference ability in complex environments, flexible resource allocation, and enhanced user experience for RAN. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive reviews on the integration of SemCom into RAN. Motivated by this, we systematically explore recent advancements in Semantic RAN (SemRAN). We begin by introducing the fundamentals of RAN and SemCom, identifying the limitations of conventional RAN, and outlining the overall architecture of SemRAN. Subsequently, we review representative techniques of SemRAN across physical layer, data link layer, network layer, and security plane. Furthermore, we envision future services and applications enabled by SemRAN, alongside its current standardization progress. Finally, we conclude by identifying critical research challenges and outlining forward-looking directions to guide subsequent investigations in this burgeoning field.

Title: BenchLink: An SoC-Based Benchmark for Resilient Communication Links in GPS-Denied Environments
Authors: Sidharth Santhi Nivas, Prem Sagar Pattanshetty Vasanth Kumar, Zhaoxi Zhang, Chenzhi Zhao, Maxwell McManus, Nicholas Mastronarde, Elizabeth Serena Bentley, George Sklivanitis, Dimitris A. Pados, Zhangyu Guan
Abstract: Accurate timing and synchronization, typically enabled by GPS, are essential for modern wireless communication systems. However, many emerging applications must operate in GPS-denied environments where signals are unreliable or disrupted, resulting in oscillator drift and carrier frequency impairments. To address these challenges, we present BenchLink, a System-on-Chip (SoC)-based benchmark for resilient communication links that functions without GPS and supports adaptive pilot density and modulation. Unlike traditional General Purpose Processor (GPP)-based software-defined radios (e.g. USRPs), the SoC-based design allows for more precise latency control. We implement and evaluate BenchLink on Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs, and demonstrate its effectiveness in both ground and aerial environments. A comprehensive dataset has also been collected under various conditions. We will make both the SoC-based link design and dataset available to the wireless community. BenchLink is expected to facilitate future research on data-driven link adaptation, resilient synchronization in GPS-denied scenarios, and emerging applications that require precise latency control, such as integrated radar sensing and communication.

Title: Decentralized water-level balancing for irrigation channels in storage critical operations
Authors: Timm Strecker, Michael Cantoni
Abstract: A feedback control system is proposed for balancing the deviations of water levels from set-points along open channels subject to uncertain supply-demand mismatch that exceeds individual pool capacity. Decentralized controllers adjust the gate flows between pools to regulate potentially weighted differences between neighbouring water-level errors to zero in steady state. A sequential SISO loop-shaping procedure is developed for the design of each local flow controller based on distributed parameter transfer function models of the channel dynamics. Recursive feasibility of the procedure for relevant performance specifications, and stability of the resulting MIMO closed-loop, are verified by supporting analysis. Both numerical simulations and field trial results are presented.

Title: Universal Transient Stability Analysis: A Large Language Model-Enabled Dynamics Prediction Framework
Authors: Chao Shen, Ke Zuo, Mingyang Sun
Abstract: Existing dynamics prediction frameworks for transient stability analysis (TSA) fail to achieve multi-scenario "universality"--the inherent ability of a single, pre-trained architecture to generalize across diverse operating conditions, unseen faults, and heterogeneous systems. To address this, this paper proposes TSA-LLM, a large language model (LLM)-based universal framework that models multi-variate transient dynamics prediction as a univariate generative task with three key innovations: First, a novel data processing pipeline featuring channel independence decomposition to resolve dimensional heterogeneity, sample-wise normalization to eliminate separate stable or unstable pipelines, and temporal patching for efficient long-sequence modeling; Second, a parameter-efficient freeze-and-finetune strategy that augments the LLM's architecture with dedicated input embedding and output projection layers while freezing core transformer blocks to preserve generic feature extraction capabilities; Third, a two-stage fine-tuning scheme that combines teacher forcing, which feeds the model ground-truth data during initial training, with scheduled sampling, which gradually shifts to leveraging model-generated predictions, to mitigate cumulative errors in long-horizon iterative prediction. Comprehensive testing demonstrates the framework's universality, as TSA-LLM trained solely on the New England 39-bus system achieves zero-shot generalization to mixed stability conditions and unseen faults, and matches expert performance on the larger Iceland 189-bus system with only 5% fine-tuning data. This multi-scenario versatility validates a universal framework that eliminates scenario-specific retraining and achieves scalability via large-scale parameters and cross-scenario training data.

Title: GenTSE: Enhancing Target Speaker Extraction via a Coarse-to-Fine Generative Language Model
Authors: Haoyang Li, Xuyi Zhuang, Azmat Adnan, Ye Ni, Wei Rao, Shreyas Gopal, Eng Siong Chng
Abstract: Language Model (LM)-based generative modeling has emerged as a promising direction for TSE, offering potential for improved generalization and high-fidelity speech. We present GenTSE, a two-stage decoder-only generative LM approach for TSE: Stage-1 predicts coarse semantic tokens, and Stage-2 generates fine acoustic tokens. Separating semantics and acoustics stabilizes decoding and yields more faithful, content-aligned target speech. Both stages use continuous SSL or codec embeddings, offering richer context than discretized-prompt methods. To reduce exposure bias, we employ a Frozen-LM Conditioning training strategy that conditions the LMs on predicted tokens from earlier checkpoints to reduce the gap between teacher-forcing training and autoregressive inference. We further employ DPO to better align outputs with human perceptual preferences. Experiments on Libri2Mix show that GenTSE surpasses previous LM-based systems in speech quality, intelligibility, and speaker consistency.

Title: Leveraging Overfitting for Low-Complexity and Modality-Agnostic Joint Source-Channel Coding
Authors: Haotian Wu, Gen Li, Pier Luigi Dragotti, Deniz Gündüz
Abstract: This paper introduces Implicit-JSCC, a novel overfitted joint source-channel coding paradigm that directly optimizes channel symbols and a lightweight neural decoder for each source. This instance-specific strategy eliminates the need for training datasets or pre-trained models, enabling a storage-free, modality-agnostic solution. As a low-complexity alternative, Implicit-JSCC achieves efficient image transmission with around 1000x lower decoding complexity, using as few as 607 model parameters and 641 multiplications per pixel. This overfitted design inherently addresses source generalizability and achieves state-of-the-art results in the high SNR regimes, underscoring its promise for future communication systems, especially streaming scenarios where one-time offline encoding supports multiple online decoding.

Title: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Enhanced Satellite Networks: Deployment Strategies, Key Capabilities, Practical Solutions, and Future Directions
Authors: Ziyuan Zheng, Xiangyu Li, Shirui Zuo, Yu Wan, Bodong Shang, Wenpeng Jing, Qingqing Wu
Abstract: Satellite networks promise wide-area 6G coverage but face two persistent barriers: blockage-induced service discontinuities and increasingly stringent spectrum coexistence across satellite layers and with terrestrial systems. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) act as low-power programmable apertures that redirect energy without the cost and power consumption of fully active arrays. We develop a deployment-first, operations-aware view of RIS-enabled satellite networking that treats RIS as both satellite/terminal antennas and inter-satellite or space-ground relays. We show that system-level gains are governed by two unifying mechanisms: connectivity restoration via virtual line-of-sight links that preserve connectivity under blockage and mobility, and angular selectivity that reshapes interference to enlarge spectrum reuse. We further discuss practical operation under high mobility, highlighting Delay-Doppler channel acquisition, predictive beam tracking, and control designs that budget overhead and latency, and summarize hardware considerations for reliable operation in space. Finally, we outline forward-looking opportunities in the generative artificial intelligence paradigm, multifunctional RIS architectures, ubiquitous satellite integrated sensing and communication, and sustainable satellite Internet-of-Things.

Title: Low-Altitude ISAC with Rotatable Active and Passive Arrays
Authors: Ziyuan Zheng, Qingqing Wu, Yanze Zhu, Honghao Wang, Ying Gao, Wen Chen, Jian Xiong
Abstract: This paper investigates a low-altitude integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system that leverages cooperative rotatable active and passive arrays. We consider a downlink scenario where a base station (BS) with an active rotatable array serves multiple communication users and senses low-altitude targets, assisted by a rotatable reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). A rotation-aware geometry-based multipath model is developed to capture the impact of three-dimensional (3D) array orientations on both steering vectors and direction-dependent element gains. On this basis, we formulate a new optimization problem that maximizes the downlink sum rate subject to a transmit power budget, RIS unit-modulus constraints, mechanical rotation limits, and a sensing beampattern mean-squared-error (MSE) constraint. To address the resulting highly non-convex problem, we propose a penalty-based alternating-optimization (AO) framework that alternately updates the BS precoder, RIS phase shifts, and BS/RIS array rotation angles. The three blocks are efficiently handled via a convex optimization method based on quadratic-transform (QT) and majorization-minorization (MM), Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) on the unit-modulus manifold, and projected gradient descent (PGD) with Barzilai-Borwein step sizes, respectively. Numerical results in low-altitude geometries demonstrate that the proposed jointly rotatable BS-RIS architecture achieves significant sum-rate gains over fixed or partially rotatable baselines while guaranteeing sensing requirements, especially with directional antennas and in interference-limited regimes.

Title: LEO Constellations as a Decentralized GNSS Network: Optimizing PNT Corrections in Space
Authors: Xing Liu, Xue Xian Zheng, José A. López-Salcedo, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Gonzalo Seco-Granados
Abstract: With the rapid expansion of low Earth orbit (LEO) constellations, thousands of satellites are now in operation, many equipped with onboard GNSS receivers capable of continuous orbit determination and time synchronization. This development is creating an unprecedented spaceborne GNSS network, offering new opportunities for network-driven precise LEO orbit and clock estimation. Yet, current onboard GNSS processing is largely standalone and often insufficient for high-precision applications, while centralized fusion is challenging due to computational bottlenecks and the lack of in-orbit infrastructure. In this work, we report a decentralized GNSS network over large-scale LEO constellations, where each satellite processes its own measurements while exchanging compact information with neighboring nodes to enable precise orbit and time determination. We model the moving constellation as a dynamic graph and tailor a momentum-accelerated gradient tracking (GT) method to ensure steady convergence despite topology changes. Numerical simulations with constellations containing hundreds of satellites show that the proposed method matches the accuracy of an ideal centralized benchmark, while substantially reducing communication burdens. Ultimately, this framework supports the development of autonomous and self-organizing space systems, enabling high-precision navigation with reduced dependence on continuous ground contact.

Title: Partitioned robustness analysis of networks with uncertain links
Authors: Simone Mariano, Chung-Yao Kao, Michael Cantoni
Abstract: An input-output model for networks with link uncertainty is developed. The main result presents a set of integral quadratic constraints (IQCs) that collectively imply robust stability of the uncertain network dynamics. The model dependency of each IQC is localized according to an edge-based partition of the network graph. The class of admissible network partitions affords scope for trading-off scalability against conservativeness. This is illustrated by numerical example.

Title: LSTM-Based Modeling and Reinforcement Learning Control of a Magnetically Actuated Catheter
Authors: Arya Rashidinejad Meibodi, Mahbod Gholamali Sinaki, Khalil Alipour
Abstract: Autonomous magnetic catheter systems are emerging as a promising approach for the future of minimally invasive interventions. This study presents a novel approach that begins by modeling the nonlinear and hysteretic dynamics of a magnetically actuated catheter system, consists of a magnetic catheter manipulated by servo-controlled magnetic fields generated by two external permanent magnets, and its complex behavior is captured using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. This model validated against experimental setup's data with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.42 mm and 99.8% coverage within 3 mm, establishing it as a reliable surrogate model. This LSTM enables the training of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents for controlling the system and avoiding damage to the real setup, with the potential for subsequent fine-tuning on the physical system. We implemented Deep Q-Network (DQN) and actor-critic RL controllers, comparing these two agents first for regulation and subsequently for path following along linear and half-sinusoidal paths for the catheter tip. The actor-critic outperforms DQN, offering greater accuracy and faster performance with less error, along with smoother trajectories at a 10 Hz sampling rate, in both regulation and path following compared to the DQN controller. This performance, due to the continuous action space, suits dynamic navigation tasks like navigating curved vascular structures for practical applications.

Title: Co-Existence of Private 5G Network and Wireless Hospital Systems
Authors: Mohsin Khan, Matti Hämäläinen, Timo J. Mäkelä, Erkki Harjula, Jani Katisko
Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of deploying private 5G networks in hospital environments, with a focus on the operating room at the brand new Oulu University Hospital, Finland. The study aims to evaluate the interference risk with other wireless systems, and electromagnetic safety of a private 5G network in the 3.9-4.1 GHz band, while ensuring compatibility with legacy wireless systems, such as LTE and Wi-Fi. We conducted a measurement campaign, employing state-of-the-art instrumentation and a methodology that combined high resolution and long-duration spectrum scans. The results demonstrate no measurable interference between the hospital's private 5G network with adjacent LTE (4G) or Wi-Fi bands, confirming the spectral isolation of the 5G transmissions, and vise versa. Additionally, RF exposure levels in the operating room were found to be well below ICNIRP, WHO, and IEEE safety thresholds, ensuring that the network poses negligible biological risk to patients and hospital staff. The study also proposes spectrum management strategies for private 5G networks in hospitals, focusing on adaptive sensing and guardband planning. These findings provide a solid foundation for the integration of private 5G infrastructure in hospitals environments, supporting digital transformation in patient care without compromising electromagnetic compatibility or patient safety. The results also contribute to ongoing discussions around private 5G network deployments in sensitive sectors and provide actionable guidelines for future hospitals' wireless systems planning.

Title: Dyna-Style Reinforcement Learning Modeling and Control of Non-linear Dynamics
Authors: Karim Abdelsalam, Zeyad Gamal, Ayman El-Badawy
Abstract: Controlling systems with complex, nonlinear dynamics poses a significant challenge, particularly in achieving efficient and robust control. In this paper, we propose a Dyna-Style Reinforcement Learning control framework that integrates Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) with Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) reinforcement learning. SINDy is used to identify a data-driven model of the system, capturing its key dynamics without requiring an explicit physical model. This identified model is used to generate synthetic rollouts that are periodically injected into the reinforcement learning replay buffer during training on the real environment, enabling efficient policy learning with limited data available. By leveraging this hybrid approach, we mitigate the sample inefficiency of traditional model-free reinforcement learning methods while ensuring accurate control of nonlinear systems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework, we apply it to a bi-rotor system as a case study, evaluating its performance in stabilization and trajectory tracking. The results show that our SINDy-TD3 approach achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to direct reinforcement learning techniques, highlighting the potential of combining data-driven modeling with reinforcement learning for complex dynamical systems.

Title: Safe Navigation with Zonotopic Tubes: An Elastic Tube-based MPC Framework
Authors: Niyousha Ghiasi, Bahare Kiumarsi, Hamidreza Modares
Abstract: This paper presents an elastic tube-based model predictive control (MPC) framework for unknown discrete-time linear systems subject to disturbances. Unlike most existing elastic tube-based MPC methods, we do not assume perfect knowledge of the system model or disturbance realizations bounds. Instead, a conservative zonotopic disturbance set is initialized and iteratively refined using data and prior knowledge: data are used to identify matrix zonotope model sets for the system dynamics, while prior physical knowledge is employed to discard models and disturbances inconsistent with known constraints. This process yields constrained matrix zonotopes representing disturbance realizations and dynamics that enable a principled fusion of offline information with limited online data, improving MPC feasibility and performance. The proposed design leverages closed-loop system characterization to learn and refine control gains that maintain a small tube size. By separating open-loop model mismatch from closed-loop effects in the error dynamics, the method avoids dependence on the size of the state and input operating regions, thereby reducing conservatism. An adaptive co-design of the tube and ancillary feedback ensures $\lambda$-contractive zonotopic tubes, guaranteeing robust positive invariance, improved feasibility margins, and enhanced disturbance tolerance. We establish recursive feasibility conditions and introduce a polyhedral Lyapunov candidate for the error tube, proving exponential stability of the closed-loop error dynamics under the adaptive tube-gain updates. Simulations demonstrate improved robustness, enlarged feasibility regions, and safe closed-loop performance using only a small amount of online data.

Title: A Multimodal Human-Centered Framework for Assessing Pedestrian Well-Being in the Wild
Authors: Yasaman Hakiminejad, Arash Tavakoli
Abstract: Pedestrian well-being is a critical yet rarely measured component of sustainable urban mobility and livable city design. Existing approaches to evaluating pedestrian environments often rely on static, infrastructure-based indices or retrospective surveys, which overlook the dynamic, subjective, and psychophysiological dimensions of everyday walking experience. This paper introduces a multimodal, human-centered framework for assessing pedestrian well-being in the wild by integrating three complementary data streams: continuous physiological sensing, geospatial tracking, and momentary self-reports collected using the Experience Sampling Method. The framework conceptualizes pedestrian experience as a triangulation enabling a holistic understanding of how urban environments influence well-being. The utility of our framework is then demonstrated through a naturalistic case study conducted in the Greater Philadelphia region, in which participants wore research-grade wearable sensors and carried GPS-enabled smartphones during their regular daily activities. Physiological indicators of autonomic nervous system activity, including heart rate variability and electrodermal activity, were synchronized with spatial trajectories and in situ self-reports of stress, affect, and perceived infrastructure conditions. Results illustrate substantial inter- and intra-individual variability in both subjective experience and physiological response, as well as context-dependent patterns associated with traffic exposure, pedestrian infrastructure quality, and environmental enclosure. The findings also suggest that commonly used walkability indices may not fully capture experiential dimensions of pedestrian well-being. By enabling real-world, multimodal measurement of pedestrian experience, the proposed framework offers a scalable and transferable approach for advancing human-centered urban analytics.

Title: Cruising the Spectrum: Joint Spectrum Mobility and Antenna Array Management for Mobile (cm/mm)Wave Connectivity
Authors: Ece Bingöl, Eylem Ekici, Mehmet C. Vuran
Abstract: The large bandwidths available at millimeter wave (mmWave) FR2 bands (24-71 GHz) and the emerging FR3 bands (7-24 GHz) are essential for supporting high data rates. Highly directional beams utilized to overcome the attenuation in these frequencies necessitate robust and efficient beamforming schemes. Nevertheless, antenna and beam management approaches still face challenges in highly mobile solutions, such as vehicular connectivity, with increasing number of bands. In this work, the concepts of spectrum mobility is studied along with antenna array management in multiple frequencies to improve beamforming under mobility. The spectrum mobility problem aims to select the optimal channel frequency and beam direction in each time slot to maximize data rate. This problem is formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and Point-Based Value Iteration (PBVI) algorithm is used to find a policy with performance guarantees. Numerical examples confirm the efficacy of the resulting policy for multiple available frequency bands, even when the user mobility significantly deviates from models assumed during policy generation.

Title: USE: A Unified Model for Universal Sound Separation and Extraction
Authors: Hongyu Wang, Chenda Li, Xin Zhou, Shuai Wang, Yanmin Qian
Abstract: Sound separation (SS) and target sound extraction (TSE) are fundamental techniques for addressing complex acoustic scenarios. While existing SS methods struggle with determining the unknown number of sound sources, TSE approaches require precisely specified clues to achieve optimal performance. This paper proposes a unified framework that synergistically combines SS and TSE to overcome their individual limitations. Our architecture employs two complementary components: 1) An Encoder-Decoder Attractor (EDA) network that automatically infers both the source count and corresponding acoustic clues for SS, and 2) A multi-modal fusion network that precisely interprets diverse user-provided clues (acoustic, semantic, or visual) for TSE. Through joint training with cross-task consistency constraints, we establish a unified latent space that bridges both paradigms. During inference, the system adaptively operates in either fully autonomous SS mode or clue-driven TSE mode. Experiments demonstrate remarkable performance in both tasks, with notable improvements of 1.4 dB SDR improvement in SS compared to baseline and 86\% TSE accuracy.

Title: ARX-Implementation of encrypted nonlinear dynamic controllers using observer form
Authors: Deuksun Hong, Donghyeon Song, Mingyu Jeong, Junsoo Kim
Abstract: While computation-enabled cryptosystems applied to control systems have improved security and privacy, a major issue is that the number of recursive operations on encrypted data is limited to a finite number of times in most cases, especially where fast computation is required. To allow for nonlinear dynamic control under this constraint, a method for representing a state-space system model as an auto-regressive model with exogenous inputs (ARX model) is proposed. With the input as well as the output of the plant encrypted and transmitted to the controller, the reformulated ARX form can compute each output using only a finite number of operations, from its several previous inputs and outputs. Existence of a stable observer for the controller is a key condition for the proposed representation. The representation replaces the controller with an observer form and applies a method similar to finite-impulse-response approximation. It is verified that the approximation error and its effect can be made arbitrarily small by an appropriate choice of a parameter, under stability of the observer and the closed-loop system. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: Neural Network-Assisted RIS Weight Optimization for Spatial Nulling in Distorted Reflector Antenna Systems
Authors: Xinrui Li, R. Michael Buehrer
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have recently been proposed as an effective means for spatial interference suppression in large reflector antenna systems. Existing RIS weight optimization algorithms typically rely on accurate theoretical radiation models. However, in practice, distortions on the reflector antenna may cause mismatches between the theoretical and true antenna patterns, leading to degraded interference cancellation performance when these weights are directly applied. In this report, a residual learning network-assisted simulated annealing (ResNet-SA) framework is proposed to address this mismatch without requiring explicit knowledge of the distorted electric field. By learning the residual difference between the theoretical and true antenna gains, a neural network (NN) is embedded in a heuristic optimization algorithm to find the optimal weight vector. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves improved null depth in the true radiation pattern as compared with conventional methods that optimize weights based solely on the theoretical model, validating the effectiveness of the ResNet-SA algorithm for reflector antenna systems with approximate knowledge of the pattern.

Title: Enhancing Grid Resilience for Giga-Watt Scale Data Centers Using High Voltage Circuit Breaker Operated Braking Resistors
Authors: Soham Ghosh, Mohammad Ashraf Hossain Sadi
Abstract: As hyperscale and co-located data centers scale, the electric grid sees an increase in large, voltage-sensitive IT loads with these data center plant size ranging between 500 MW to 2 GW. A sudden loss of these loads as they switch to onsite UPS during grid voltage excursion events causes a grid frequency rise from generation and load imbalance, and a voltage rise because less power is flowing through the network. This paper proposes and theoretically demonstrates the use of high voltage circuit breaker operated braking resistors at data center transmission substations as an effective strategy in enhancing grid resilience under such large load loss scenarios. We developed a test bed to illustrate the dynamic behavior of the system with resistive braking on a gigawatt scale data center load cluster connected to a 345 kV network. The braking resistor(s), which in the case of inverter rich system comes in a multi-stage configuration, are connected or disconnected via high-speed circuit breaker(s). Results show that insertion for 0.25 to 0.85 seconds sufficiently reduce rate of change of frequency and provides time for primary governor response and capacitor switching to restore steady state. Sensitivity across different synchronous machines and inverter-based resource mix are tested and confirms robustness. We conclude circuit breaker controlled resistive braking is a practical means to enhance Bulk Electric System (BES) resilience for gigawatt scale data centers. The approach integrates with protection, needs no generator changes, and can be scaled with cluster size or growth of the data center facility load.

Title: A Lyapunov-Based Small-Gain Theorem for Fixed-Time ISS: Theory, Optimization, and Games
Authors: Michael Tang, Miroslav Krstic, Jorge Poveda
Abstract: We develop a Lyapunov-based small-gain theorem for establishing fixed-time input-to-state stability (FxT-ISS) guarantees in interconnected nonlinear dynamical systems. The proposed framework considers interconnections in which each subsystem admits a FxT-ISS Lyapunov function, providing robustness with respect to external inputs. We show that, under an appropriate nonlinear small-gain condition, the overall interconnected system inherits the FxT-ISS property. In this sense, the proposed result complements existing Lyapunov-based smallgain theorems for asymptotic and finite-time stability, and enables a systematic analysis of interconnection structures exhibiting fixed-time stability. To illustrate the applicability of the theory, we study feedback-based optimization problems with time-varying cost functions, and Nash-equilibrium seeking for noncooperative games with nonlinear dynamical plants in the loop. For both problems, we present a class of non-smooth gradient or pseudogradient-based controllers that achieve fixed-time convergence without requiring time-scale separation and using real-time feedback. Numerical examples are provided to validate the theoretical findings.

Title: Versatile CMOS Analog LIF Neuron for Memristor-Integrated Neuromorphic Circuits
Authors: Nikhil Garg, Davide Florini, Patrick Dufour, Eloir Muhr, Mathieu Faye, Marc Bocquet, Damien Querlioz, Yann Beilliard, Dominique Drouin, Fabien Alibart, Jean-Michel Portal
Abstract: Heterogeneous systems with analog CMOS circuits integrated with nanoscale memristive devices enable efficient deployment of neural networks on neuromorphic hardware. CMOS Neuron with low footprint can emulate slow temporal dynamics by operating with extremely low current levels. Nevertheless, the current read from the memristive synapses can be higher by several orders of magnitude, and performing impedance matching between neurons and synapses is mandatory. In this paper, we implement an analog leaky integrate and fire (LIF) neuron with a voltage regulator and current attenuator for interfacing CMOS neurons with memristive synapses. In addition, the neuron design proposes a dual leakage that could enable the implementation of local learning rules such as voltage-dependent synaptic plasticity. We also propose a connection scheme to implement adaptive LIF neurons based on two-neuron interaction. The proposed circuits can be used to interface with a variety of synaptic devices and process signals of diverse temporal dynamics.

Title: Energy-convergence trade off for the training of neural networks on bio-inspired hardware
Authors: Nikhil Garg, Paul Uriarte Vicandi, Yanming Zhang, Alexandre Baigol, Donato Francesco Falcone, Saketh Ram Mamidala, Bert Jan Offrein, Laura Bégon-Lours
Abstract: The increasing deployment of wearable sensors and implantable devices is shifting AI processing demands to the extreme edge, necessitating ultra-low power for continuous operation. Inspired by the brain, emerging memristive devices promise to accelerate neural network training by eliminating costly data transfers between compute and memory. Though, balancing performance and energy efficiency remains a challenge. We investigate ferroelectric synaptic devices based on HfO2/ZrO2 superlattices and feed their experimentally measured weight updates into hardware-aware neural network simulations. Across pulse widths from 20 ns to 0.2 ms, shorter pulses lower per-update energy but require more training epochs while still reducing total energy without sacrificing accuracy. Classification accuracy using plain stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is diminished compared to mixed-precision SGD. We analyze the causes and propose a ``symmetry point shifting'' technique, addressing asymmetric updates and restoring accuracy. These results highlight a trade-off among accuracy, convergence speed, and energy use, showing that short-pulse programming with tailored training significantly enhances on-chip learning efficiency.

Title: Unsupervised local learning based on voltage-dependent synaptic plasticity for resistive and ferroelectric synapses

Abstract: The deployment of AI on edge computing devices faces significant challenges related to energy consumption and functionality. These devices could greatly benefit from brain-inspired learning mechanisms, allowing for real-time adaptation while using low-power. In-memory computing with nanoscale resistive memories may play a crucial role in enabling the execution of AI workloads on these edge devices. In this study, we introduce voltage-dependent synaptic plasticity (VDSP) as an efficient approach for unsupervised and local learning in memristive synapses based on Hebbian principles. This method enables online learning without requiring complex pulse-shaping circuits typically necessary for spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). We show how VDSP can be advantageously adapted to three types of memristive devices (TiO$_2$, HfO$_2$-based metal-oxide filamentary synapses, and HfZrO$_4$-based ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJ)) with disctinctive switching characteristics. System-level simulations of spiking neural networks incorporating these devices were conducted to validate unsupervised learning on MNIST-based pattern recognition tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The results demonstrated over 83% accuracy across all devices using 200 neurons. Additionally, we assessed the impact of device variability, such as switching thresholds and ratios between high and low resistance state levels, and proposed mitigation strategies to enhance robustness.

Title: Extragradient methods with complexity guarantees for hierarchical variational inequalities
Authors: Pavel Dvurechensky, Meggie Marschner, Shimrit Shtern, Mathias Staudigl
Abstract: In the framework of a real Hilbert space we consider the problem of approaching solutions to a class of hierarchical variational inequality problems, subsuming several other problem classes including certain mathematical programs under equilibrium constraints, constrained min-max problems, hierarchical game problems, optimal control under VI constraints, and simple bilevel optimization problems. For this general problem formulation, we establish rates of convergence in terms of suitably constructed gap functions, measuring feasibility gaps and optimality gaps. We present worst-case iteration complexity results on both levels of the variational problem, as well as weak convergence under a geometric weak sharpness condition on the lower level solution set. Our results match and improve the state of the art in terms of their iteration complexity and the generality of the problem formulation.

Title: Robustness Certificates for Neural Networks against Adversarial Attacks
Authors: Sara Taheri, Mahalakshmi Sabanayagam, Debarghya Ghoshdastidar, Majid Zamani
Abstract: The increasing use of machine learning in safety-critical domains amplifies the risk of adversarial threats, especially data poisoning attacks that corrupt training data to degrade performance or induce unsafe behavior. Most existing defenses lack formal guarantees or rely on restrictive assumptions about the model class, attack type, extent of poisoning, or point-wise certification, limiting their practical reliability. This paper introduces a principled formal robustness certification framework that models gradient-based training as a discrete-time dynamical system (dt-DS) and formulates poisoning robustness as a formal safety verification problem. By adapting the concept of barrier certificates (BCs) from control theory, we introduce sufficient conditions to certify a robust radius ensuring that the terminal model remains safe under worst-case ${\ell}_p$-norm based poisoning. To make this practical, we parameterize BCs as neural networks trained on finite sets of poisoned trajectories. We further derive probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds by solving a scenario convex program (SCP), which yields a confidence lower bound on the certified robustness radius generalizing beyond the training set. Importantly, our framework also extends to certification against test-time attacks, making it the first unified framework to provide formal guarantees in both training and test-time attack settings. Experiments on MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10 show that our approach certifies non-trivial perturbation budgets while being model-agnostic and requiring no prior knowledge of the attack or contamination level.

Title: Early warning signals for loss of control
Authors: Jasper J. van Beers, Marten Scheffer, Prashant Solanki, Ingrid A. van de Leemput, Egbert H. van Nes, Coen C. de Visser
Abstract: Maintaining stability in feedback systems, from aircraft and autonomous robots to biological and physiological systems, relies on monitoring their behavior and continuously adjusting their inputs. Incremental damage can make such control fragile. This tends to go unnoticed until a small perturbation induces instability (i.e. loss of control). Traditional methods in the field of engineering rely on accurate system models to compute a safe set of operating instructions, which become invalid when the, possibly damaged, system diverges from its model. Here we demonstrate that the approach of such a feedback system towards instability can nonetheless be monitored through dynamical indicators of resilience. This holistic system safety monitor does not rely on a system model and is based on the generic phenomenon of critical slowing down, shown to occur in the climate, biology and other complex nonlinear systems approaching criticality. Our findings for engineered devices opens up a wide range of applications involving real-time early warning systems as well as an empirical guidance of resilient system design exploration, or "tinkering". While we demonstrate the validity using drones, the generic nature of the underlying principles suggest that these indicators could apply across a wider class of controlled systems including reactors, aircraft, and self-driving cars.

Title: NeRV360: Neural Representation for 360-Degree Videos with a Viewport Decoder
Authors: Daichi Arai, Kyohei Unno, Yasuko Sugito, Yuichi Kusakabe
Abstract: Implicit neural representations for videos (NeRV) have shown strong potential for video compression. However, applying NeRV to high-resolution 360-degree videos causes high memory usage and slow decoding, making real-time applications impractical. We propose NeRV360, an end-to-end framework that decodes only the user-selected viewport instead of reconstructing the entire panoramic frame. Unlike conventional pipelines, NeRV360 integrates viewport extraction into decoding and introduces a spatial-temporal affine transform module for conditional decoding based on viewpoint and time. Experiments on 6K-resolution videos show that NeRV360 achieves a 7-fold reduction in memory consumption and a 2.5-fold increase in decoding speed compared to HNeRV, a representative prior work, while delivering better image quality in terms of objective metrics.

Title: AirGS: Real-Time 4D Gaussian Streaming for Free-Viewpoint Video Experiences
Authors: Zhe Wang, Jinghang Li, Yifei Zhu
Abstract: Free-viewpoint video (FVV) enables immersive viewing experiences by allowing users to view scenes from arbitrary perspectives. As a prominent reconstruction technique for FVV generation, 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) models dynamic scenes with time-varying 3D Gaussian ellipsoids and achieves high-quality rendering via fast rasterization. However, existing 4DGS approaches suffer from quality degradation over long sequences and impose substantial bandwidth and storage overhead, limiting their applicability in real-time and wide-scale deployments. Therefore, we present AirGS, a streaming-optimized 4DGS framework that rearchitects the training and delivery pipeline to enable high-quality, low-latency FVV experiences. AirGS converts Gaussian video streams into multi-channel 2D formats and intelligently identifies keyframes to enhance frame reconstruction quality. It further combines temporal coherence with inflation loss to reduce training time and representation size. To support communication-efficient transmission, AirGS models 4DGS delivery as an integer linear programming problem and design a lightweight pruning level selection algorithm to adaptively prune the Gaussian updates to be transmitted, balancing reconstruction quality and bandwidth consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AirGS reduces quality deviation in PSNR by more than 20% when scene changes, maintains frame-level PSNR consistently above 30, accelerates training by 6 times, reduces per-frame transmission size by nearly 50% compared to the SOTA 4DGS approaches.

Title: Knowledge-Driven 3D Semantic Spectrum Map: KE-VQ-Transformer Based UAV Semantic Communication and Map Completion
Authors: Wei Wu, Lingyi Wang, Fuhui Zhou, Zhaohui Yang, Qihui Wu
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-native three-dimensional (3D) spectrum maps are crucial in spectrum monitoring for intelligent communication networks. However, it is challenging to obtain and transmit 3D spectrum maps in a spectrum-efficient, computation-efficient, and AI-driven manner, especially under complex communication environments and sparse sampling data. In this paper, we consider practical air-to-ground semantic communications for spectrum map completion, where the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) measures the spectrum at spatial points and extracts the spectrum semantics, which are then utilized to complete spectrum maps at the ground device. Since statistical machine learning can easily be misled by superficial data correlations with the lack of interpretability, we propose a novel knowledge-enhanced semantic spectrum map completion framework with two expert knowledge-driven constraints from physical signal propagation models. This framework can capture the real-world physics and avoid getting stuck in the mindset of superficial data distributions. Furthermore, a knowledge-enhanced vector-quantized Transformer (KE-VQ-Transformer) based multi-scale low-complex intelligent completion approach is proposed, where the sparse window is applied to avoid ultra-large 3D attention computation, and the multi-scale design improves the completion performance. The knowledge-enhanced mean square error (KMSE) and root KMSE (RKMSE) are introduced as novel metrics for semantic spectrum map completion that jointly consider the numerical precision and physical consistency with the signal propagation model, based on which a joint offline and online training method is developed with supervised and unsupervised knowledge loss. The simulation demonstrates that our proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmark schemes in terms of RKMSE.

Title: Energy-Gain Control of Time-Varying Systems: Receding Horizon Approximation
Authors: Jintao Sun, Michael Cantoni
Abstract: Standard formulations of prescribed worstcase disturbance energy-gain control policies for linear time-varying systems depend on all forward model data. In a discrete-time setting, this dependence arises through a backward Riccati recursion. The aim herein is to consider the infinite-horizon $\ell_2$ gain performance of state feedback policies with only finite receding-horizon preview of the model parameters. The proposed synthesis of controllers subject to such a constraint leverages the strict contraction of lifted Riccati operators under uniform controllability and observability. The main approximation result establishes a sufficient number of preview steps for the performance loss to remain below any set tolerance, relative to the baseline gain bound of the associated infinite-preview controller. Aspects of the main result are explored in the context of a numerical example.

Title: Flocking phase transition and threat responses in bio-inspired autonomous drone swarms
Authors: Matthieu Verdoucq, Dari Trendafilov, Clément Sire, Ramón Escobedo, Guy Theraulaz, Gautier Hattenberger
Abstract: Collective motion inspired by animal groups offers powerful design principles for autonomous aerial swarms. We present a bio-inspired 3D flocking algorithm in which each drone interacts only with a minimal set of influential neighbors, relying solely on local alignment and attraction cues. By systematically tuning these two interaction gains, we map a phase diagram revealing sharp transitions between swarming and schooling, as well as a critical region where susceptibility, polarization fluctuations, and reorganization capacity peak. Outdoor experiments with a swarm of ten drones, combined with simulations using a calibrated flight-dynamics model, show that operating near this transition enhances responsiveness to external disturbances. When confronted with an intruder, the swarm performs rapid collective turns, transient expansions, and reliably recovers high alignment within seconds. These results demonstrate that minimal local-interaction rules are sufficient to generate multiple collective phases and that simple gain modulation offers an efficient mechanism to adjust stability, flexibility, and resilience in drone swarms.

Title: Wireless Center of Pressure Feedback System for Humanoid Robot Balance Control using ESP32-C3
Authors: Muhtadin, Faris Rafi Pramana, Dion Hayu Fandiantoro, Moh Ismarintan Zazuli, Atar Fuady Babgei
Abstract: Maintaining stability during the single-support phase is a fundamental challenge in humanoid robotics, particularly in dance robots that require complex maneuvers and high mechanical freedom. Traditional tethered sensor configurations often restrict joint movement and introduce mechanical noises. This study proposes a wireless embedded balance system designed to maintain stability on uneven surfaces. The system utilizes a custom-designed foot unit integrated with four load cells and an ESP32-C3 microcontroller to estimate the Center of Pressure (CoP) in real time. The CoP data were transmitted wirelessly to the main controller to minimize the wiring complexity of the 29-DoF VI-ROSE humanoid robot. A PID control strategy is implemented to adjust the torso, hip, and ankle roll joints based on CoP feedback. Experimental characterization demonstrated high sensor precision with an average measurement error of 14.8 g. Furthermore, the proposed control system achieved a 100% success rate in maintaining balance during single-leg lifting tasks at a 3-degree inclination with optimized PID parameters (Kp=0.10, Kd=0.005). These results validate the efficacy of wireless CoP feedback in enhancing the postural stability of humanoid robots, without compromising their mechanical flexibility.

Title: $\mathcal{K}$-Lorentzian Polynomials, Semipositive Cones, and Cone-Stable EVI Systems
Authors: Papri Dey
Abstract: Lorentzian and completely log-concave polynomials have recently emerged as a unifying framework for negative dependence, log-concavity, and convexity in combinatorics and probability. We extend this theory to variational analysis and cone-constrained dynamics by studying $K$-Lorentzian and $K$-completely log-concave polynomials over a proper convex cone $K\subset\mathbb{R}^n$. For a $K$-Lorentzian form $f$ and $v\in\operatorname{int}K$, we define an open cone $K^\circ(f,v)$ and a closed cone $K(f,v)$ via directional derivatives along $v$, recovering the usual hyperbolicity cone when $f$ is hyperbolic. We prove that $K^\circ(f,v)$ is a proper cone and equals $\operatorname{int}K(f,v)$. If $f$ is $K(f,v)$-Lorentzian, then $K(f,v)$ is convex and maximal among convex cones on which $f$ is Lorentzian. Using the Rayleigh matrix $M_f(x)=\nabla f(x)\nabla f(x)^T - f(x)\nabla^2 f(x)$, we obtain cone-restricted Rayleigh inequalities and show that two-direction Rayleigh inequalities on $K$ are equivalent to an acuteness condition for the bilinear form $v^T M_f(x) w$. This yields a cone-restricted negative-dependence interpretation linking the curvature of $\log f$ to covariance properties of associated Gibbs measures. For determinantal generating polynomials, we identify the intersection of the hyperbolicity cone with the nonnegative orthant as the classical semipositive cone, and we extend this construction to general proper cones via $K$-semipositive cones. Finally, for linear evolution variational inequality (LEVI) systems, we show that if $q(x)=x^T A x$ is (strictly) $K$-Lorentzian, then $A$ is (strictly) $K$-copositive and yields Lyapunov (semi-)stability on $K$, giving new Lyapunov criteria for cone-constrained dynamics.

Title: Equitable non-contact infrared thermography after solar loading using deep learning
Authors: Ellin Q. Zhao, Alexander Vilesov, Pradyumna Chari, Laleh Jalilian, Achuta Kadambi
Abstract: Widely deployed for fever detection, infrared thermometers (IRTs) enable rapid non-contact measurement of core body temperature but are inaccurate in unconstrained environments when skin temperature is transient. In this work, we present the first study on the effect of solar loading--solar radiation-induced elevation of skin but not core temperature--on IRT performance. Solar loading causes poor specificity in IRT fever detection, and the standard procedure is to reacclimate subjects for up to 30 minutes before IRT measurement. In contrast, we propose a single-shot deep learning model that removes solar loading transients from thermal facial images, allowing accurate IRT operation in solar loaded conditions. Forehead skin temperature increases by 2.00°C after solar loading, and our deep learning model, SL-Net, reduces this error by 68\% to 0.64°C. We show that the solar loading effect depends on skin tone, introducing inequity in IRT performance, while SL-Net is unbiased. We open source a diverse dataset of 100 subjects with co-registered RGB-thermal images, and IRT and skin tone measurements. Our work shows that it is possible to use machine learning to correct complex thermal perturbations to enable robust and equitable human thermography.

Title: Turbulent Multiple-Scattering Channel Modeling for Ultraviolet Communications: A Monte-Carlo Integration Approach
Authors: Renzhi Yuan, Xinyi Chu, Tao Shan, Chuang Yang, Mugen Peng
Abstract: Modeling of multiple-scattering channels in atmospheric turbulence is essential for the performance analysis of long-distance non-line-of-sight (NLOS) ultraviolet (UV) communications. Existing works on the turbulent channel modeling for NLOS UV communications either focused on single-scattering cases or estimate the turbulent fluctuation effect in an unreliable way based on Monte-Carlo simulation (MCS) approach. In this paper, we establish a comprehensive turbulent multiple-scattering channel model by using a more efficient Monte-Carlo integration (MCI) approach for NLOS UV communications, where both the scattering, absorption, and turbulence effects are considered. Compared with the MCS approach, the MCI approach is more interpretable for estimating the turbulent fluctuation. To achieve this, we first introduce the scattering, absorption, and turbulence effects for NLOS UV communications in turbulent channels. Then we propose the estimation methods based on MCI approach for estimating both the turbulent fluctuation and the distribution of turbulent fading coefficient. Numerical results demonstrate that the turbulence-induced scattering effect can always be ignored for typical UV communication scenarios. Besides, the turbulent fluctuation will increase as either the communication distance increases or the zenith angle decreases, which is compatible with existing experimental results and also with our experimental results. Moreover, we demonstrate numerically that the distribution of the turbulent fading coefficient for UV multiple-scattering channels under all turbulent conditions can be approximated as log-normal distribution; and we also demonstrate both numerically and experimentally that the turbulent fading can be approximated as a Gaussian distribution under weak turbulence.

Title: Differentially Private Gradient-Tracking-Based Distributed Stochastic Optimization over Directed Graphs
Authors: Jialong Chen, Jimin Wang, Ji-Feng Zhang
Abstract: This paper proposes a differentially private gradient-tracking-based distributed stochastic optimization algorithm over directed graphs. In particular, privacy noises are incorporated into each agent's state and tracking variable to mitigate information leakage, after which the perturbed states and tracking variables are transmitted to neighbors. We design two novel schemes for the step-sizes and the sampling number within the algorithm. The sampling parameter-controlled subsampling method employed by both schemes enhances the differential privacy level, and ensures a finite cumulative privacy budget even over infinite iterations. The algorithm achieves both almost sure and mean square convergence for nonconvex objectives. Furthermore, when nonconvex objectives satisfy the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, Scheme (S1) achieves a polynomial mean square convergence rate, and Scheme (S2) achieves an exponential mean square convergence rate. The trade-off between privacy and convergence is presented. The effectiveness of the algorithm and its superior performance compared to existing works are illustrated through numerical examples of distributed training on the benchmark datasets "MNIST" and "CIFAR-10".

Title: Reducing Latency by Eliminating CSIT Feedback: FDD Downlink MIMO Transmission for Internet-of-Things Communications
Authors: Juntaek Han, Namhyun Kim, Jeonghun Park
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for low-latency frequency division duplex (FDD) multi-input multi-output (MIMO) transmission with Internet of Things (IoT) communications. Our key idea is eliminating feedback associated with downlink channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) acquisition. Instead, we propose to reconstruct downlink CSIT from uplink reference signals by exploiting the frequency invariance property of channel parameters. Nonetheless, the frequency disparity between the uplink and downlink makes it impossible to get perfect downlink CSIT, resulting in substantial interference. To address this, we formulate a max-min fairness problem and propose a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-aided efficient precoding method. In particular, to fully harness the potential benefits of RSMA, we propose a method that approximates the error covariance matrix and incorporates it into the precoder optimization process. This approach effectively accounts for the impact of imperfect CSIT, enabling the design of a robust precoder that efficiently handles CSIT inaccuracies. Simulation results demonstrate that our framework outperforms other baseline methods in terms of the minimum spectral efficiency when no direct CSI feedback is used. Moreover, we show that our framework significantly reduces communication latency compared to conventional CSI feedback-based methods, underscoring its effectiveness in enhancing latency performance for IoT communications.

Title: Network-Realised Model Predictive Control Part II: Distributed Constraint Management
Authors: Andrei Sperilă, Alessio Iovine, Sorin Olaru, Patrick Panciatici
Abstract: A two-layer control architecture is proposed, which promotes scalable implementations for model predictive controllers. The top layer acts as both reference governor for the bottom layer, and as a feedback controller for the regulated network. By employing set-based methods, global theoretical guarantees are obtained by enforcing local constraints upon the network's variables and upon those of the first layer's implementation. The proposed technique offers recursive feasibility guarantees as one of its central features, and the expressions of the resulting predictive strategies bear a striking resemblance to classical formulations from model predictive control literature, allowing for flexible and easily customisable implementations.

Title: Aerial Active STAR-RIS-assisted Satellite-Terrestrial Covert Communications
Authors: Chuang Zhang, Geng Sun, Jiahui Li, Jiacheng Wang, Ruichen Zhang, Dusit Niyato, Shiwen Mao, Abbas Jamalipour
Abstract: An integration of satellites and terrestrial networks is crucial for enhancing performance of next generation communication systems. However, the networks are hindered by the long-distance path loss and security risks in dense urban environments. In this work, we propose a satellite-terrestrial covert communication system assisted by the aerial active simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (AASTAR-RIS) to improve the channel capacity while ensuring the transmission covertness. Specifically, we first derive the minimal detection error probability (DEP) under the worst condition that the Warden has perfect channel state information (CSI). Then, we formulate an AASTAR-RIS-assisted satellite-terrestrial covert communication optimization problem (ASCCOP) to maximize the sum of the fair channel capacity for all ground users while meeting the strict covert constraint, by jointly optimizing the trajectory and active beamforming of the AASTAR-RIS. Due to the challenges posed by the complex and high-dimensional state-action spaces as well as the need for efficient exploration in dynamic environments, we propose a generative deterministic policy gradient (GDPG) algorithm, which is a generative deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to solve the ASCCOP. Concretely, the generative diffusion model (GDM) is utilized as the policy representation of the algorithm to enhance the exploration process by generating diverse and high-quality samples through a series of denoising steps. Moreover, we incorporate an action gradient mechanism to accomplish the policy improvement of the algorithm, which refines the better state-action pairs through the gradient ascent. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms important benchmarks.

Abstract: Early detection of breast cancer is critical for improving patient outcomes. While mammography remains the primary screening modality, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly recommended as a supplemental tool for women with dense breast tissue and those at elevated risk. However, the acquisition and interpretation of multiparametric breast MRI are time-consuming and require specialized expertise, limiting scalability in clinical practice. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have shown promise in supporting breast MRI interpretation, but their development is hindered by the limited availability of large, diverse, and publicly accessible datasets. To address this gap, we present a publicly available, multi-center breast MRI dataset collected across six clinical institutions in five European countries. The dataset comprises 741 examinations from women undergoing screening or diagnostic breast MRI and includes malignant, benign, and non-lesion cases. Data were acquired using heterogeneous scanners, field strengths, and acquisition protocols, reflecting real-world clinical variability. In addition, we report baseline benchmark experiments using a transformer-based model to illustrate potential use cases of the dataset and to provide reference performance for future methodological comparisons.

Title: Demonstrating Integrative, Scalable and Extensible Modeling of Hydrological Systems with Model-Based Systems Engineering and Hetero-functional Graph Theory
Authors: Megan S. Harris, Ehsanoddin Ghorbanichemazkati, Mohammad Mahdi Naderi, John C. Little, Amro M. Farid
Abstract: Worsening global challenges demand solutions grounded in a systems-level understanding of coupled social and environmental dynamics. Existing environmental models encode extensive knowledge of individual systems, yet much of this information remains isolated within domain-specific formulations and data structures. This paper introduces a unified modeling framework that formalizes information from existing process models by asserting real-world physical relationships onto their underlying mathematical representations. By integrating Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) with Hetero-functional Graph Theory (HFGT), the framework establishes a consistent ontology that explicitly defines system structure and behavior. Illustrative hydrological examples demonstrate implementation of the methodology, showing how relationships embedded in conventional process models can be made explicit and scalable. While simplified, these examples provide a first step toward applying the approach to complex environmental systems. More broadly, the methodology offers a foundation for future modeling of systems of systems within a shared computational architecture.

Title: Improving Action Smoothness for a Cascaded Online Learning Flight Control System
Authors: Yifei Li, Erik-jan van Kampen
Abstract: This paper aims to improve the action smoothness of a cascaded online learning flight control system. Although the cascaded structure is widely used in flight control design, its stability can be compromised by oscillatory control actions, which poses challenges for practical engineering applications. To address this issue, we introduce an online temporal smoothness technique and a low-pass filter to reduce the amplitude and frequency of the control actions. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to analyze policy performance in the frequency domain. Simulation results demonstrate the improvements achieved by the two proposed techniques.

Title: EEG Foundation Models: A Critical Review of Current Progress and Future Directions
Authors: Gayal Kuruppu, Neeraj Wagh, Vaclav Kremen, Sandipan Pati, Gregory Worrell, Yogatheesan Varatharajah
Abstract: Premise. Patterns of electrical brain activity recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) offer immense value for scientific and clinical investigations. The inability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their over-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards general-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models (EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the real-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubrics for long-term research progress remain unclear. Objective. In this work, we conduct a review of ten early EEG-FMs to capture common trends and identify key directions for future development of EEG-FMs. Methods. We comparatively analyze each EEG-FM using three fundamental pillars of foundation modeling, namely the representation of input data, self-supervised modeling, and the evaluation strategy. Based on this analysis, we present a critical synthesis of EEG-FM methodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. Results. We find that most EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on transformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked temporal EEG sequences for self-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely limited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility. In addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work should demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and trustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline. Significance. Our review indicates that the development of benchmarks, software tools, technical methodologies, and applications in collaboration with domain experts may advance the translational utility and real-world adoption of EEG-FMs.

Title: Gait Transitions in Load-Pulling Quadrupeds: Insights from Sled Dogs and a Minimal SLIP Model
Authors: Jiayu Ding, Benjamin Seleb, Heather J. Huson, Saad Bhamla, Zhenyu Gan
Abstract: Quadrupedal animals employ diverse galloping strategies to optimize speed, stability, and energy efficiency. However, the biomechanical mechanisms that enable adaptive gait transitions during high-speed locomotion under load remain poorly understood. In this study, we present new empirical and modeling insights into the biomechanics of load-pulling quadrupeds, using sprint sled dogs as a model system. High-speed video and force recordings reveal that sled dogs often switch between rotary and transverse galloping gaits within just a few strides and without any observable changes in speed, stride duration, or terrain, providing clear evidence of locomotor multistability during high-speed load-pulling. To investigate the mechanical basis of these transitions, a physics-based quadrupedal Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum model with hybrid dynamics and prescribed footfall sequences to reproduce the asymmetric galloping patterns observed in racing sled dogs. Through trajectory optimization, we replicate experimentally observed gait sequences and identify swing-leg stiffness modulation as a key control mechanism for inducing transitions. This work provides a much-needed biomechanical perspective on high-speed animal draft and establishes a modeling framework for studying locomotion in pulling quadrupeds, with implications for both biological understanding and the design of adaptive legged systems.

Title: Fluid Antenna-enabled Near-Field Integrated Sensing, Computing and Semantic Communication for Emerging Applications
Authors: Yinchao Yang, Jingxuan Zhou, Zhaohui Yang, Mohammad Shikh-Bahaei
Abstract: The integration of sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key enabler for next-generation technologies. With high-frequency bands and large-scale antenna arrays, the Rayleigh distance extends, necessitating near-field (NF) models where waves are spherical. Although NF-ISAC improves both sensing and communication, it also poses challenges such as high data volume and potential privacy risks. To address these, we propose a novel framework: near-field integrated sensing, computing, and semantic communication (NF-ISCSC), which leverages semantic communication to transmit contextual information only, thereby reducing data overhead and improving efficiency. However, semantic communication is sensitive to channel variations, requiring adaptive mechanisms. To this end, fluid antennas (FAs) are introduced to support the NF-ISCSC system, enabling dynamic adaptability to changing channels. The proposed FA-enabled NF-ISCSC framework considers multiple communication users and extended targets comprising several scatterers. A joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize data rate while accounting for sensing quality, computational load, and power budget. Using an alternating optimization (AO) approach, the original problem is divided into three sub-problems: ISAC beamforming, FA positioning, and semantic extraction ratio. Beamforming is optimized using the successive convex approximation method. FA positioning is solved via a projected Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm, and the semantic extraction ratio is optimized using bisection search. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves higher data rates and better privacy preservation.

Title: Unifying Common Signal Analyses with Instantaneous Time-Frequency Atoms
Authors: Steven Sandoval, Phillip L. De Leon
Abstract: In previous work, we presented a general framework for instantaneous time-frequency analysis but did not provide any specific details of how to compute a particular instantaneous spectrum (IS). In this work, we use instantaneous time-frequency atoms to obtain an IS associated with common signal analyses: time domain analysis, frequency domain analysis, fractional Fourier transform, synchrosqueezed short-time Fourier transform, and synchrosqueezed short-time fractional Fourier transform. By doing so, we demonstrate how the general framework can be used to unify these analyses and we develop closed-form expressions for the corresponding ISs. This is accomplished by viewing these analyses as decompositions into AM--FM components and recognizing that each uses a specialized (or limiting) form of a quadratic chirplet as a template during analysis. With a two-parameter quadratic chirplet, we can organize these ISs into a 2D continuum with points in the plane corresponding to a decomposition related to one of the signal analyses. Finally, using several example signals, we compute in closed-form the ISs for the various analyses.

Title: Electromagnetic Formation Flying Using Alternating Magnetic Field Forces and Control Barrier Functions for State and Input Constraints
Authors: Sumit S. Kamat, T. Michael Seigler, Jesse B. Hoagg
Abstract: This article presents a feedback control algorithm for electromagnetic formation flying with constraints on the satellites' states and control inputs. The algorithm combines several key techniques. First, we use alternating magnetic field forces to decouple the electromagnetic forces between each pair of satellites in the formation. Each satellite's electromagnetic actuation system is driven by a sum of amplitude-modulated sinusoids, where amplitudes are controlled in order to prescribe the time-averaged force between each pair of satellites. Next, the desired time-averaged force is computed from a optimal control that satisfies state constraints (i.e., no collisions and an upper limit on intersatellite speeds) and input constraints (i.e., not exceeding satellite's apparent power capability). The optimal time-averaged force is computed using a single relaxed control barrier function that is obtained by composing multiple control barrier functions that are designed to enforce each state and input constraint. Finally, we demonstrate the satellite formation control method in numerical simulations.

Abstract: We propose an equilibrium model of ski resorts where users are assigned to cycles in a closed network. As queues form on lifts with limited capacity, we derive an efficient way to find waiting times via convex optimization. The equilibrium problem is formulated as a variational inequality, and numerical experiments show that it can be solved using standard algorithms.

Authors: Suraj Kumar, Aditya Rallapalli, Ashok Kumar Kakula, Bharat Kumar GVP
Abstract: India achieved a significant milestone on August $23^{\text{rd}}$ 2023, becoming the fourth country to accomplish a soft landing on the Moon. This paper presents the powered descent trajectory design for the Chandrayaan-3 mission. The optimization framework is based on pseudospectral Radau collocation, and controllability-based waypoint refinement is employed to further enhance the robustness of the trajectory against state and control perturbations. Furthermore, the trade-off between fuel consumption and robustness is explicitly quantified, providing insights into the practical considerations of mission planning.

Title: Nonholonomic Robot Parking by Feedback -- Part I: Modular Strict CLF Designs
Authors: Velimir Todorovski, Kwang Hak Kim, Alessandro Astolfi, Miroslav Krstic
Abstract: It has been known in the robotics literature since about 1995 that, in polar coordinates, the nonholonomic unicycle is asymptotically stabilizable by smooth feedback, even globally. We introduce a modular design framework that selects the forward velocity to decouple the radial coordinate, allowing the steering subsystem to be stabilized independently. Within this structure, we develop families of feedback laws using passivity, backstepping, and integrator forwarding. Each law is accompanied by a strict control Lyapunov function, including barrier variants that enforce angular constraints. These strict CLFs provide constructive class KL convergence estimates and enable eigenvalue assignment at the target equilibrium. The framework generalizes and extends prior modular and nonmodular approaches, while preparing the ground for inverse optimal and adaptive redesigns in the sequel paper.

Title: Nonholonomic Robot Parking by Feedback -- Part II: Nonmodular, Inverse Optimal, Adaptive, Prescribed/Fixed-Time and Safe Designs
Authors: Kwang Hak Kim, Velimir Todorovski, Miroslav Krstić
Abstract: For the unicycle system, we provide constructive methods for the design of feedback laws that have one or more of the following properties: being nonmodular and globally exponentially stabilizing, inverse optimal, robust to arbitrary decrease or increase of input coefficients, adaptive, prescribed/fixed-time stabilizing, and safe (ensuring the satisfaction of state constraints). Our nonmodular backstepping feedbacks are implementable with either unidirectional or bidirectional velocity actuation. Thanks to constructing families of strict CLFs for the unicycle, we introduce a general design framework and families of feedback laws for the unicycle, which are inverse optimal with respect to meaningful costs. These inverse optimal feedback laws are endowed with robustness to actuator uncertainty and arbitrarily low input saturation due to the unicycle's driftlessness. Besides ensuring robustness to unknown input coefficients, we also develop adaptive laws for these unknown coefficients, enabling the achievement of good transient performance with lower initial control effort. Additionally, we develop controllers that achieve stabilization within a user-specified time horizon using two systematic methods: time-dilated prescribed-time design with smooth-in-time convergence to zero of both the states and the inputs and homogeneity-based fixed-time control that provides an explicit bound on the settling time. Finally, with a nonovershooting design we guarantee strictly forward motion without curb violation. This article, along with its Part I, lays a broad constructive design foundation for stabilization of the nonholonomic unicycle.

Title: Adaptive Trajectory Bundle Method for Roll-to-Roll Manufacturing Systems
Authors: Jiachen Li, Shihao Li, Christopher Martin, Wei Li, Dongmei Chen
Abstract: Roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing requires precise tension and velocity control under operational constraints. Model predictive control demands gradient computation, while sampling-based methods like MPPI struggle with hard constraint satisfaction. This paper presents an adaptive trajectory bundle method that achieves rigorous constraint handling through derivative-free sequential convex programming. The approach approximates nonlinear dynamics and costs via interpolated sample bundles, replacing Taylor-series linearization with function-value interpolation. Adaptive trust region and penalty mechanisms automatically adjust based on constraint violation metrics, eliminating manual tuning. We establish convergence guarantees proving finite-time feasibility and convergence to stationary points of the constrained problem. Simulations on a six-zone R2R system demonstrate that the adaptive method achieves 4.3\% lower tension RMSE than gradient-based MPC and 11.1\% improvement over baseline TBM in velocity transients, with superior constraint satisfaction compared to MPPI variants. Experimental validation on an R2R dry transfer system confirms faster settling and reduced overshoot relative to LQR and non-adaptive TBM.

Title: Closed-Loop Control Law for Low Thrust Orbit Transfer with Guaranteed Stability
Authors: Suraj Kumar, Aditya Rallapalli, Nivriti Priyadarshini, Bharat Kumar GVP, Ravi Kumar L
Abstract: Electric propulsion is used to maximize payload capacity in communication satellites. These orbit raising maneuvers span several months and hundreds of revolutions, making trajectory design a complex challenge. The literature typically addresses this problem using feedback laws, with Q-law being one of the most prominent approaches. However, Q-law suffers from closed-loop stability issues, limiting its suitability for real-time on-board implementation. In this work, we focus on closed-loop orbit raising rather than offline trajectory planning and address the stability limitations of the Q-law through a Lyapunov based control design. A Lyapunov-guided modification of the classical Q-law is proposed to ensure closed-loop stability and enable real-time implementation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through closed-loop orbit transfers across various scenarios, including co-planar transfers, equatorial to polar orbit transfers, and geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) to geostationary earth orbit (GEO) transfers.

Title: V-Rex: Real-Time Streaming Video LLM Acceleration via Dynamic KV Cache Retrieval
Authors: Donghyuk Kim, Sejeong Yang, Wonjin Shin, Joo-Young Kim
Abstract: Streaming video large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for real-time multimodal tasks such as video captioning, question answering, conversational agents, and augmented reality. However, these models face fundamental memory and computational challenges because their key-value (KV) caches grow substantially with continuous streaming video input. This process requires an iterative prefill stage, which is a unique feature of streaming video LLMs. Due to its iterative prefill stage, it suffers from significant limitations, including extensive computation, substantial data transfer, and degradation in accuracy. Crucially, this issue is exacerbated for edge deployment, which is the primary target for these models. In this work, we propose V-Rex, the first software-hardware co-designed accelerator that comprehensively addresses both algorithmic and hardware bottlenecks in streaming video LLM inference. At its core, V-Rex introduces ReSV, a training-free dynamic KV cache retrieval algorithm. ReSV exploits temporal and spatial similarity-based token clustering to reduce excessive KV cache memory across video frames. To fully realize these algorithmic benefits, V-Rex offers a compact, low-latency hardware accelerator with a dynamic KV cache retrieval engine (DRE), featuring bit-level and early-exit based computing units. V-Rex achieves unprecedented real-time of 3.9-8.3 FPS and energy-efficient streaming video LLM inference on edge deployment with negligible accuracy loss. While DRE only accounts for 2.2% power and 2.0% area, the system delivers 1.9-19.7x speedup and 3.1-18.5x energy efficiency improvements over AGX Orin GPU. This work is the first to comprehensively tackle KV cache retrieval across algorithms and hardware, enabling real-time streaming video LLM inference on resource-constrained edge devices.

Title: Safe Online Control-Informed Learning
Authors: Tianyu Zhou, Zihao Liang, Zehui Lu, Shaoshuai Mou
Abstract: This paper proposes a Safe Online Control-Informed Learning framework for safety-critical autonomous systems. The framework unifies optimal control, parameter estimation, and safety constraints into an online learning process. It employs an extended Kalman filter to incrementally update system parameters in real time, enabling robust and data-efficient adaptation under uncertainty. A softplus barrier function enforces constraint satisfaction during learning and control while eliminating the dependence on high-quality initial guesses. Theoretical analysis establishes convergence and safety guarantees, and the framework's effectiveness is demonstrated on cart-pole and robot-arm systems.

Title: The MIMO-ME-MS Channel: Analysis and Algorithm for Secure MIMO Integrated Sensing and Communications
Authors: Seongkyu Jung, Namyoon Lee, Jeonghun Park
Abstract: This paper studies precoder design for secure MIMO integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) by introducing the MIMO-ME-MS channel, where a multi-antenna transmitter serves a legitimate multi-antenna receiver in the presence of a multi-antenna eavesdropper while simultaneously enabling sensing via a multi-antenna sensing receiver. Using sensing mutual information as the sensing metric, we formulate a nonconvex weighted objective that jointly captures secure communication (via secrecy rate) and sensing performance. A high-SNR analysis based on subspace decomposition characterizes the maximum achievable weighted degrees of freedom and reveals that a quasi-optimal precoder must span a "useful subspace," highlighting why straightforward extensions of classical wiretap/ISAC precoders can be suboptimal in this tripartite setting. Motivated by these insights, we develop a practical two-stage iterative algorithm that alternates between sequential basis construction and power allocation via a difference-of-convex program. Numerical results show that the proposed approach captures the desirable precoding structure predicted by the analysis and yields substantial gains in the MIMO-ME-MS channel.

Title: Explicit Group Sparse Projection with Applications to Deep Learning and NMF
Authors: Riyasat Ohib, Nicolas Gillis, Niccolò Dalmasso, Sameena Shah, Vamsi K. Potluru, Sergey Plis
Abstract: We design a new sparse projection method for a set of vectors that guarantees a desired average sparsity level measured leveraging the popular Hoyer measure (an affine function of the ratio of the $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norms). Existing approaches either project each vector individually or require the use of a regularization parameter which implicitly maps to the average $\ell_0$-measure of sparsity. Instead, in our approach we set the sparsity level for the whole set explicitly and simultaneously project a group of vectors with the sparsity level of each vector tuned automatically. We show that the computational complexity of our projection operator is linear in the size of the problem. Additionally, we propose a generalization of this projection by replacing the $\ell_1$ norm by its weighted version. We showcase the efficacy of our approach in both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks on image datasets including CIFAR10 and ImageNet. In deep neural network pruning, the sparse models produced by our method on ResNet50 have significantly higher accuracies at corresponding sparsity values compared to existing competitors. In nonnegative matrix factorization, our approach yields competitive reconstruction errors against state-of-the-art algorithms.

Title: Reaction-diffusion systems derived from kinetic theory for Multiple Sclerosis
Authors: Romina Travaglini, João Miguel Oliveira
Abstract: We present a mathematical study for the development of Multiple Sclerosis in which a spatio-temporal kinetic { theory} model describes, at the mesoscopic level, the dynamics of a high number of interacting agents. We consider both interactions among different populations of human cells and the motion of immune cells, stimulated by cytokines. Moreover, we reproduce the consumption of myelin sheath due to anomalously activated lymphocytes and its restoration by oligodendrocytes. Successively, we fix a small time parameter and assume that the considered processes occur at different scales. This allows us to perform a formal limit, obtaining macroscopic reaction-diffusion equations for the number densities with a chemotaxis term. A natural step is then to study the system, inquiring about the formation of spatial patterns through a Turing instability analysis of the problem and basing the discussion on the microscopic parameters of the model. In particular, we get spatial patterns oscillating in time that may reproduce brain lesions characteristic of different phases of the pathology.

Title: High contrast holography through dual modulation
Authors: Leyla Kabuli, Oliver Cossairt, Florian Schiffers, Nathan Matsuda, Grace Kuo
Abstract: Holographic displays are a promising technology for immersive visual experiences, and their potential for compact form factor makes them a strong candidate for head-mounted displays. However, at the short propagation distances needed for a compact, head-mounted architecture, image contrast is low when using a traditional phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM). Although a complex SLM could restore contrast, these modulators require bulky lenses to optically co-locate the amplitude and phase components, making them poorly suited for a compact head-mounted design. In this work, we introduce a novel architecture to improve contrast: by adding a low resolution amplitude SLM a short distance away from the phase modulator, we demonstrate peak signal-to-noise ratio improvement up to 31 dB in simulation and 6.5 dB experimentally compared to phase-only modulation, even when the amplitude modulator is 60$\times$ lower resolution than its phase counterpart. We analyze the relationship between diffraction angle and amplitude modulator pixel size, and validate the concept with a benchtop experimental prototype. By showing that low resolution modulation is sufficient to improve contrast, we open new design spaces for high-contrast holographic displays.

Title: Optimal Control with Natural Images: Efficient Reinforcement Learning using Overcomplete Sparse Codes
Authors: Peter N. Loxley
Abstract: Optimal control and sequential decision making are widely used in many complex tasks. Optimal control over a sequence of natural images is a first step towards understanding the role of vision in control. Here, we formalize this problem as a reinforcement learning task, and derive general conditions under which an image includes enough information to implement an optimal policy. Reinforcement learning is shown to provide a computationally efficient method for finding optimal policies when natural images are encoded into "efficient" image representations. This is demonstrated by introducing a new reinforcement learning benchmark that easily scales to large numbers of states and long horizons. In particular, by representing each image as an overcomplete sparse code, we are able to efficiently solve an optimal control task that is orders of magnitude larger than those tasks solvable using complete codes. Theoretical justification for this behaviour is provided. This work also demonstrates that deep learning is not necessary for efficient optimal control with natural images.

Title: Linear Stability Analysis of a Constant Quaternion Difference Attitude Controller
Authors: Yujendra Mitikiri
Abstract: It is quite often claimed, and correctly so, that linear methods cannot achieve global stability results for attitude control, and conversely that nonlinear control is essential in order to achieve (almost) globally stable tracking of general attitude trajectories. On account of this definitive result, and also because of the existence of powerful nonlinear control techniques, there has been relatively very little work analyzing the limits and performance of linear attitude control. It is the purpose of this paper to provide a characterization of the stability achievable for one class of linear attitude control problems, namely those leading to a constant quaternion difference. In this paper, we analytically derive a critical error angle below which linearized dynamics lead to natural marginal stability for such a system, and above which the system is unstable. The dynamics are then used to derive a locally stable linear attitude controller whose performance is validated using simulations.

Title: A Multicore and Edge TPU-Accelerated Multimodal TinyML System for Livestock Behavior Recognition
Authors: Qianxue Zhang, Eiman Kanjo
Abstract: The advancement of technology has revolutionized the agricultural industry, transitioning it from labor-intensive farming practices to automated, AI-powered management systems. In recent years, more intelligent livestock monitoring solutions have been proposed to enhance farming efficiency and productivity. This work presents a novel approach to animal activity recognition and movement tracking, leveraging tiny machine learning (TinyML) techniques, wireless communication framework, and microcontroller platforms to develop an efficient, cost-effective livestock sensing system. It collects and fuses accelerometer data and vision inputs to build a multimodal network for three tasks: image classification, object detection, and behavior recognition. The system is deployed and evaluated on commercial microcontrollers for real-time inference using embedded applications, demonstrating up to 270$\times$ model size reduction, less than 80ms response latency, and on-par performance comparable to existing methods. The incorporation of the wireless communication technique allows for seamless data transmission between devices, benefiting use cases in remote locations with poor Internet connectivity. This work delivers a robust, scalable IoT-edge livestock monitoring solution adaptable to diverse farming needs, offering flexibility for future extensions.

Title: Learning Enhanced Ensemble Filters
Authors: Eviatar Bach, Ricardo Baptista, Edoardo Calvello, Bohan Chen, Andrew Stuart
Abstract: The filtering distribution in hidden Markov models evolves according to the law of a mean-field model in state-observation space. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) approximates this mean-field model with an ensemble of interacting particles, employing a Gaussian ansatz for the joint distribution of the state and observation at each observation time. These methods are robust, but the Gaussian ansatz limits accuracy. Here this shortcoming is addressed by using machine learning to map the joint predicted state and observation to the updated state estimate. The derivation of methods from a mean field formulation of the true filtering distribution suggests a single parametrization of the algorithm that can be deployed at different ensemble sizes. And we use a mean field formulation of the ensemble Kalman filter as an inductive bias for our architecture. To develop this perspective, in which the mean-field limit of the algorithm and finite interacting ensemble particle approximations share a common set of parameters, a novel form of neural operator is introduced, taking probability distributions as input: a measure neural mapping (MNM). A MNM is used to design a novel approach to filtering, the MNM-enhanced ensemble filter (MNMEF), which is defined in both the mean-field limit and for interacting ensemble particle approximations. The ensemble approach uses empirical measures as input to the MNM and is implemented using the set transformer, which is invariant to ensemble permutation and allows for different ensemble sizes. In practice fine-tuning of a small number of parameters, for specific ensemble sizes, further enhances the accuracy of the scheme. The promise of the approach is demonstrated by its superior root-mean-square-error performance relative to leading methods in filtering the Lorenz '96 and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky models.

Title: DiTSinger: Scaling Singing Voice Synthesis with Diffusion Transformer and Implicit Alignment
Authors: Zongcai Du, Guilin Deng, Xiaofeng Guo, Xin Gao, Linke Li, Kaichang Cheng, Fubo Han, Siyu Yang, Peng Liu, Pan Zhong, Qiang Fu
Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion-based Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) demonstrates strong expressiveness but remains limited by data scarcity and model scalability. We introduce a two-stage pipeline: a compact seed set of human-sung recordings is constructed by pairing fixed melodies with diverse LLM-generated lyrics, and melody-specific models are trained to synthesize over 500 hours of high-quality Chinese singing data. Building on this corpus, we propose DiTSinger, a Diffusion Transformer with RoPE and qk-norm, systematically scaled in depth, width, and resolution for enhanced fidelity. Furthermore, we design an implicit alignment mechanism that obviates phoneme-level duration labels by constraining phoneme-to-acoustic attention within character-level spans, thereby improving robustness under noisy or uncertain alignments. Extensive experiments validate that our approach enables scalable, alignment-free, and high-fidelity SVS.

Title: A Data-Centric Approach to Generalizable Speech Deepfake Detection
Authors: Wen Huang, Yuchen Mao, Yanmin Qian
Abstract: Achieving robust generalization in speech deepfake detection (SDD) remains a primary challenge, as models often fail to detect unseen forgery methods. While research has focused on model-centric and algorithm-centric solutions, the impact of data composition is often underexplored. This paper proposes a data-centric approach, analyzing the SDD data landscape from two practical perspectives: constructing a single dataset and aggregating multiple datasets. To address the first perspective, we conduct a large-scale empirical study to characterize the data scaling laws for SDD, quantifying the impact of source and generator diversity. To address the second, we propose the Diversity-Optimized Sampling Strategy (DOSS), a principled framework for mixing heterogeneous data with two implementations: DOSS-Select (pruning) and DOSS-Weight (re-weighting). Our experiments show that DOSS-Select outperforms the naive aggregation baseline while using only 3% of the total available data. Furthermore, our final model, trained on a 12k-hour curated data pool using the optimal DOSS-Weight strategy, achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming large-scale baselines with greater data and model efficiency on both public benchmarks and a new challenge set of various commercial APIs.

Title: Designing Spatial Architectures for Sparse Attention: STAR Accelerator via Cross-Stage Tiling
Authors: Huizheng Wang, Taiquan Wei, Hongbin Wang, Zichuan Wang, Xinru Tang, Zhiheng Yue, Shaojun Wei, Yang Hu, Shouyi Yin
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on self-attention for contextual understanding, demanding high-throughput inference and large-scale token parallelism (LTPP). Existing dynamic sparsity accelerators falter under LTPP scenarios due to stage-isolated optimizations. Revisiting the end-to-end sparsity acceleration flow, we identify an overlooked opportunity: cross-stage coordination can substantially reduce redundant computation and memory access. We propose STAR, a cross-stage compute- and memory-efficient algorithm-hardware co-design tailored for Transformer inference under LTPP. STAR introduces a leading-zero-based sparsity prediction using log-domain add-only operations to minimize prediction overhead. It further employs distributed sorting and a sorted updating FlashAttention mechanism, guided by a coordinated tiling strategy that enables fine-grained stage interaction for improved memory efficiency and latency. These optimizations are supported by a dedicated STAR accelerator architecture, achieving up to 9.2$\times$ speedup and 71.2$\times$ energy efficiency over A100, and surpassing SOTA accelerators by up to 16.1$\times$ energy and 27.1$\times$ area efficiency gains. Further, we deploy STAR onto a multi-core spatial architecture, optimizing dataflow and execution orchestration for ultra-long sequence processing. Architectural evaluation shows that, compared to the baseline design, Spatial-STAR achieves a 20.1$\times$ throughput improvement.
