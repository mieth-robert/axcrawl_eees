Title: COSMOS: Coherent Supergaussian Modeling with Spatial Priors for Sparse-View 3D Splatting
Authors: Chaeyoung Jeong, Kwangsu Kim
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a promising approach for 3D reconstruction, providing explicit, point-based representations and enabling high-quality real time rendering. However, when trained with sparse input views, 3DGS suffers from overfitting and structural degradation, leading to poor generalization on novel views. This limitation arises from its optimization relying solely on photometric loss without incorporating any 3D structure priors. To address this issue, we propose Coherent supergaussian Modeling with Spatial Priors (COSMOS). Inspired by the concept of superpoints from 3D segmentation, COSMOS introduces 3D structure priors by newly defining supergaussian groupings of Gaussians based on local geometric cues and appearance features. To this end, COSMOS applies inter group global self-attention across supergaussian groups and sparse local attention among individual Gaussians, enabling the integration of global and local spatial information. These structure-aware features are then used for predicting Gaussian attributes, facilitating more consistent 3D reconstructions. Furthermore, by leveraging supergaussian-based grouping, COSMOS enforces an intra-group positional regularization to maintain structural coherence and suppress floaters, thereby enhancing training stability under sparse-view conditions. Our experiments on Blender and DTU show that COSMOS surpasses state-of-the-art methods in sparse-view settings without any external depth supervision.

Title: Adaptive Resolution and Chroma Subsampling for Energy-Efficient Video Coding
Authors: Amritha Premkumar, Christian Herglotz
Abstract: Conventional video encoders typically employ a fixed chroma subsampling format, such as YUV420, which may not optimally reflect variations in chroma detail across different types of content. This can lead to suboptimal chroma quality and inefficiencies in bitrate allocation. We propose an Adaptive Resolution-Chroma Subsampling (ARCS) framework that jointly optimizes spatial resolution and chroma subsampling to balance perceptual quality and decoding efficiency. ARCS selects an optimal (resolution, chroma format) pair for each bitrate by maximizing a composite quality-complexity objective, while enforcing monotonicity constraints to ensure smooth transitions between representations. Experimental results using x265 show that, compared to a fixed-format encoding (YUV444), on average, ARCS achieves a 13.48 % bitrate savings and a 62.18 % reduction in decoding time, which we use as a proxy for the decoding energy, to yield the same colorVideoVDP score. The proposed framework introduces chroma adaptivity as a new control dimension for energy-efficient video streaming.

Title: ALIEN: Analytic Latent Watermarking for Controllable Generation
Authors: Liangqi Lei, Keke Gai, Jing Yu, Qi Wu
Abstract: Watermarking is a technical alternative to safeguarding intellectual property and reducing misuse. Existing methods focus on optimizing watermarked latent variables to balance watermark robustness and fidelity, as Latent diffusion models (LDMs) are considered a powerful tool for generative tasks. However, reliance on computationally intensive heuristic optimization for iterative signal refinement results in high training overhead and local optima this http URL address these issues, we propose an \underline{A}na\underline{l}ytical Watermark\underline{i}ng Framework for Controllabl\underline{e} Generatio\underline{n} (ALIEN). We develop the first analytical derivation of the time-dependent modulation coefficient that guides the diffusion of watermark residuals to achieve controllable watermark embedding this http URL results show that ALIEN-Q outperforms the state-of-the-art by 33.1\% across 5 quality metrics, and ALIEN-R demonstrates 14.0\% improved robustness against generative variant and stability threats compared to the state-of-the-art across 15 distinct conditions.

Title: PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems Using Neural Networks: A Case Study on the Importance of Dataset Generalization
Authors: Bianca S. de C. da Silva, Pedro H. C. de Souza, Luciano L. Mendes
Abstract: In [1], we introduced a NN designed to reduce the PAPR in OFDM systems. However, the original study did not include explicit generalization tests to assess how well the NN would perform on previously unseen data, which prevented a comprehensive evaluation of the model's robustness and applicability in diverse scenarios. To address this gap, we conducted additional generalization assessments, the results of which are presented in this case study. These results serve both to complement and to refine the original analysis reported in [1]. Most importantly, the overall conclusions of the initial study remain valid: the NN is still able to reduce the PAPR level to a desired reference value, also with a lower computational cost, confirming the effectiveness and practical applicability of the proposed method across a more generalized setting.

Title: STACodec: Semantic Token Assignment for Balancing Acoustic Fidelity and Semantic Information in Audio Codecs
Authors: Kaiyuan Zhang, Mohan Shi, Eray Eren, Natarajan Balaji Shankar, Zilai Wang, Abeer Alwan
Abstract: Neural audio codecs are widely used for audio compression and can be integrated into token-based language models. Traditional codecs preserve acoustic details well but lack semantic information. Recent hybrid codecs attempt to incorporate semantic information through distillation, but this often degrades reconstruction performance, making it difficult to achieve both. To address this limitation, we introduce STACodec, a unified codec that integrates semantic information from self-supervised learning (SSL) models into the first layer of residual vector quantization (RVQ-1) via semantic token assignment (STA). To further eliminate reliance on SSL-based semantic tokenizers and improve efficiency during inference, we propose a semantic pre-distillation (SPD) module, which predicts semantic tokens directly for assignment to the first RVQ layer during inference. Experimental results show that STACodec outperforms existing hybrid codecs in both audio reconstruction and downstream semantic tasks, demonstrating a better balance between acoustic fidelity and semantic capability.

Title: From Hallucination to Articulation: Language Model-Driven Losses for Ultra Low-Bitrate Neural Speech Coding
Authors: Jayeon Yi, Minje Kim
Abstract: ``Phoneme Hallucinations (PH)'' commonly occur in low-bitrate DNN-based codecs. It is the generative decoder's attempt to synthesize plausible outputs from excessively compressed tokens missing some semantic information. In this work, we propose language model-driven losses (LM loss) and show they may alleviate PHs better than a semantic distillation (SD) objective in very-low-bitrate settings. The proposed LM losses build upon language models pretrained to associate speech with text. When ground-truth transcripts are unavailable, we propose to modify a popular automatic speech recognition (ASR) model, Whisper, to compare the decoded utterance against the ASR-inferred transcriptions of the input speech. Else, we propose to use the timed-text regularizer (TTR) to compare WavLM representations of the decoded utterance against BERT representations of the ground-truth transcriptions. We test and compare LM losses against an SD objective, using a reference codec whose three-stage training regimen was designed after several popular codecs. Subjective and objective evaluations conclude that LM losses may provide stronger guidance to extract semantic information from self-supervised speech representations, boosting human-perceived semantic adherence while preserving overall output quality. Demo samples, code, and checkpoints are available online.

Title: Dynamic Quantum Optimal Communication Topology Design for Consensus Control in Linear Multi-Agent Systems
Authors: Milad Hasanzadeh, Amin Kargarian
Abstract: This paper proposes a quantum framework for the design of communication topologies in consensus-based multi-agent systems. The communication graph is selected online by solving a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP) that minimizes a cost combining communication and distance penalties with degree-regularization terms, while enforcing exact connectivity through a flow-based formulation. To cope with the combinatorial complexity of this NP-hard problem, we develop a three-block ADMM scheme that decomposes the MIQP into a convex quadratic program in relaxed edge and flow variables, a pure binary unconstrained subproblem, and a closed-form auxiliary update. The binary subproblem is mapped to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) Hamiltonian and approximately solved via quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE). The resulting time-varying, optimizer-generated Laplacians are applied to linear first- and second-order consensus dynamics. Numerical simulations on networks demonstrate that the proposed method produces connected topologies that satisfy degree constraints, achieve consensus, and incur costs comparable to those of classical mixed-integer solvers, thereby illustrating how quantum algorithms can be embedded as topology optimizers within closed-loop distributed control architectures.

Title: Content-Driven Frame-Level Bit Prediction for Rate Control in Versatile Video Coding
Authors: Amritha Premkumar, Prajit T Rajendran, Vignesh V Menon, Christian Herglotz
Abstract: Rate control allocates bits efficiently across frames to meet a target bitrate while maintaining quality. Conventional two-pass rate control (2pRC) in Versatile Video Coding (VVC) relies on analytical rate-QP models, which often fail to capture nonlinear spatial-temporal variations, causing quality instability and high complexity due to multiple trial encodes. This paper proposes a content-adaptive framework that predicts frame-level bit consumption using lightweight features from the Video Complexity Analyzer (VCA) and quantization parameters within a Random Forest regression. On ultra-high-definition sequences encoded with VVenC, the model achieves strong correlation with ground truth, yielding R2 values of 0.93, 0.88, and 0.77 for I-, P-, and B-frames, respectively. Integrated into a rate-control loop, it achieves comparable coding efficiency to 2pRC while reducing total encoding time by 33.3%. The results show that VCA-driven bit prediction provides a computationally efficient and accurate alternative to conventional rate-QP models.

Title: A hard-constrained NN learning framework for rapidly restoring AC-OPF from DC-OPF
Authors: Kejun Chen, Bernard Knueven, Wesley Jones
Abstract: This paper proposes a hard-constrained unsupervised learning framework for rapidly solving the non-linear and non-convex AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) problem in real-time operation. Without requiring ground-truth AC-OPF solutions, feasibility and optimality are ensured through a properly designed learning environment and training loss. Inspired by residual learning, the neural network (NN) learns the correction mapping from the DC-OPF solution to the active power setpoints of the generators through re-dispatch. A subsequent optimization model is utilized to restore the optimal AC-OPF solution, and the resulting projection difference is employed as the training loss. A replay buffer is utilized to enhance learning efficiency by fully leveraging past data pairs. The optimization model is cast as a differentiable optimization layer, where the gradient is derived by applying the implicit function theorem to the KKT conditions at the optimal solution. Tested on IEEE-118 and PEGASE-9241 bus systems, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed NN can obtain strictly feasible and near-optimal solutions with reduced computational time compared to conventional optimization solvers. In addition, aided by the updated DC-OPF solution under varying topologies, the trained NN, together with the PF solver, can rapidly find the corresponding AC solution. The proposed method achieves a $40\times$ time speedup, while maintaining an average constraint violation on the order of $10^{-4}$ and an optimization gap below $1\%$.

Title: B-GRPO: Unsupervised Speech Emotion Recognition based on Batched-Group Relative Policy Optimization
Authors: Yingying Gao, Shilei Zhang, Runyan Yang, Zihao Cui, Junlan Feng
Abstract: Unsupervised speech emotion recognition (SER) focuses on addressing the problem of data sparsity and annotation bias of emotional speech. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising method which enhances the performance through rule-based or model-based verification functions rather than human annotations. We treat the sample selection during the learning process as a long-term procedure and whether to select a sample as the action to make policy, thus achieving the application of RL to measure sample quality in SER. We propose a modified Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to adapt it to classification problems, which takes the samples in a batch as a group and uses the average reward of these samples as the baseline to calculate the advantage. And rather than using a verifiable reward function as in GRPO, we put forward self-reward functions and teacher-reward functions to encourage the model to produce high-confidence outputs. Experiments indicate that the proposed method improves the performance of baseline without RL by 19.8%.

Title: Zero-shot Multi-Contrast Brain MRI Registration by Intensity Randomizing T1-weighted MRI (LUMIR25)
Authors: Hengjie Liu, Yimeng Dou, Di Xu, Xinyi Fu, Dan Ruan, Ke Sheng
Abstract: In this paper, we summarize the methods and results of our submission to the LUMIR25 challenge in Learn2Reg 2025, which achieved 1st place overall on the test set. Extended from LUMIR24, this year's task focuses on zero-shot registration under domain shifts (high-field MRI, pathological brains, and various MRI contrasts), while the training data comprise only in-domain T1-weighted brain MRI. We start with a meticulous analysis of LUMIR24 winners to identify the main contributors to good monomodal registration performance. To achieve good generalization with diverse contrasts from a model trained with T1-weighted MRI only, we employ three simple but effective strategies: (i) a multimodal loss based on the modality-independent neighborhood descriptor (MIND), (ii) intensity randomization for appearance augmentation, and (iii) lightweight instance-specific optimization (ISO) on feature encoders at inference time. On the validation set, our approach achieves reasonable T1-T2 registration accuracy while maintaining good deformation regularity.

Title: Hybrid-Field Joint Channel and Visible Region Estimation for RIS-Assisted Communications
Authors: Xiaokun Tuo, Ming-Min Zhao, Xiang Wang, Changsheng You, Min-Jian Zhao
Abstract: In reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication systems, the large-scale RIS introduces pronounced geometric effects that lead to the coexistence of far-field and near-field propagation. Furthermore, random blockages induce spatial non-stationarity across the RIS array, causing signals from different scatterers to illuminate only partial regions, referred to as visible regions (VRs). This renders conventional far-field and fully visible array-based channel models inadequate and makes channel estimation particularly challenging. In this paper, we investigate the non-stationary cascaded channel estimation problem in a hybrid-field propagation environment, where the RIS-base station (BS) link operates in the far-field, while the user-RIS link exhibits near-field characteristics with partial visibility. To address the resulting high-dimensional and coupled estimation problem, a reduced-dimensional sparse bilinear representation is developed by exploiting the structural characteristics of the cascaded channel. In particular, a dictionary compression technique is proposed to represent the high-dimensional coupled dictionary using a low-dimensional polar-domain dictionary weighted by a visibility matrix, thereby significantly reducing the problem scale. Based on this representation, a turbo-structured joint Bayesian estimation (TS-JBE) approach is proposed to simultaneously estimate the channel gains, VRs, and off-grid parameters, thereby avoiding error propagation inherent in existing sequential methods. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the estimation accuracy compared with existing approaches.

Title: AS-Mamba: Asymmetric Self-Guided Mamba Decoupled Iterative Network for Metal Artifact Reduction
Authors: Bowen Ning, Zekun Zhou, Xinyi Zhong, Zhongzhen Wang, HongXin Wu, HaiTao Wang, Liu Shi, Qiegen Liu
Abstract: Metal artifact significantly degrades Computed Tomography (CT) image quality, impeding accurate clinical diagnosis. However, existing deep learning approaches, such as CNN and Transformer, often fail to explicitly capture the directional geometric features of artifacts, leading to compromised structural restoration. To address these limitations, we propose the Asymmetric Self-Guided Mamba (AS-Mamba) for metal artifact reduction. Specifically, the linear propagation of metal-induced streak artifacts aligns well with the sequential modeling capability of State Space Models (SSMs). Consequently, the Mamba architecture is leveraged to explicitly capture and suppress these directional artifacts. Simultaneously, a frequency domain correction mechanism is incorporated to rectify the global amplitude spectrum, thereby mitigating intensity inhomogeneity caused by beam hardening. Furthermore, to bridge the distribution gap across diverse clinical scenarios, we introduce a self-guided contrastive regularization strategy. Extensive experiments on public andclinical dental CBCT datasets demonstrate that AS-Mamba achieves superior performance in suppressing directional streaks and preserving structural details, validating the effectiveness of integrating physical geometric priors into deep network design.

Title: Advances in Battery Energy Storage Management: Control and Economic Synergies
Authors: Venkata Rajesh Chundru, Shreshta Rajakumar Deshpande, Stanislav A Gankov
Abstract: The existing literature on Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) predominantly focuses on two main areas: control system design aimed at achieving grid stability and the techno-economic analysis of BESS dispatch on power grid. However, with the increasing incorporation of ancillary services into power grids, a more comprehensive approach to energy management systems is required. Such an approach should not only optimize revenue generation from BESS but also ensure the safe, efficient, and reliable operation of lithium-ion batteries. This research seeks to bridge this gap by exploring literature that addresses both the economic and operational dimensions of BESS. Specifically, it examines how economic aspects of grid duty cycles can align with control schemes deployed in BESS systems. This alignment, or synergy, could be instrumental in creating robust digital twins virtual representations of BESS systems that enhance both grid stability and revenue potential. The literature review is organized into five key categories: (1) ancillary services for BESS, exploring support functions that BESS can provide to power grids; (2) control systems developed for real-time BESS power flow management, ensuring smooth operations under dynamic grid conditions; (3) optimization algorithms for BESS dispatch, focusing on efficient energy allocation strategies; (4) techno-economic analyses of BESS and battery systems to assess their financial viability; and (5) digital twin technologies for real-world BESS deployments, enabling advanced predictive maintenance and performance optimization. This review will identify potential synergies, research gaps, and emerging trends, paving the way for future innovations in BESS management and deployment strategies.

Title: Xona Pulsar Single-Satellite Positioning: System Perspective and Experimental Validation
Authors: Thyagaraja Marathe, Tyler G. R. Reid, Srinivas Tantry, Michael O'Meara
Abstract: Xona is deploying Pulsar, a low Earth orbit (LEO) commercial navigation system designed to deliver resilient positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) where traditional solutions fall short. Pulsar satellites broadcast dedicated signals optimized for commercial users. This brings rapid geometry change, strong Doppler observability, and robust timing, enabling new approaches to positioning even when only one satellite is visible. Internet of Things (IoT) applications often prioritize availability over sub-meter accuracy in urban canyons, semi-indoor spaces, and other constrained environments. Many platforms are battery-powered, have strict size, weight, and power (SWaP) limits, and cannot support complex multi-sensor architectures. Leveraging LEO dynamics and signal strength, Pulsar can maintain navigation capability under these conditions without specialized user hardware. Here we present a single-satellite positioning (SSP) concept that uses available Pulsar measurements to estimate user position and receiver clock states without external aiding. Early in Pulsar deployment, only one or two satellites may be in view, yet this still benefits stationary or near-stationary users, including in semi-indoor and indoor settings. We discuss algorithmic details and system implications: SSP enables positioning with minimal satellite visibility, reduces reliance on dense constellations, and supports integration into resource-constrained platforms. We present simulation and live sky results. High-fidelity constellation simulations configured for Pulsar provide controlled performance assessment. We also present early findings from a Pulsar-enabled receiver using observations from the Pulsar-0 satellite on orbit. Preliminary tests demonstrate meter-level accuracy outdoors and indoors, highlighting potential under varied reception conditions.

Title: ARIS-RSMA Enhanced ISAC System: Joint Rate Splitting and Beamforming Design
Authors: Xin Jin, Tiejun Lv, Yashuai Cao, Jie Zeng, Mugen Peng
Abstract: This letter proposes an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS) assisted rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system to overcome the fairness bottleneck in multi-target sensing under obstructed line-of-sight environments. Beamforming at the transceiver and ARIS, along with rate splitting, are optimized to maximize the minimum multi-target echo signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio under multi-user rate and power constraints. The intricate non-convex problem is decoupled into three subproblems and solved iteratively by majorization-minimization (MM) and sequential rank-one constraint relaxation (SROCR) algorithms. Simulations show our scheme outperforms nonorthogonal multiple access, space-division multiple access, and passive RIS baselines, approaching sensing-only upper bounds.

Title: Safety Controller Synthesis for Stochastic Polynomial Time-Delayed Systems
Authors: Omid Akbarzadeh, MohammadHossein Ashoori, Amy Nejati, Abolfazl Lavaei
Abstract: This work develops a theoretical framework for safety controller synthesis in discrete-time stochastic nonlinear polynomial systems subject to time-invariant delays (dt-SNPS-td). While safety analysis of stochastic systems using control barrier certificates (CBC) has been widely studied, developing safety controllers for stochastic systems with time delays remains largely unexplored. The main challenge arises from the need to account for the influence of delayed components when formulating and enforcing safety conditions. To address this, we employ Krasovskii control barrier certificates, which extend the conventional CBC framework by augmenting it with an additional summation term that captures the influence of delayed states. This formulation integrates both the current and delayed components into a unified barrier structure, enabling safety synthesis for stochastic systems with time delays. The proposed approach synthesizes safety controllers under input constraints, offering probabilistic safety guarantees robust to such delays: it ensures that all trajectories of the dt-SNPS-td remain within the prescribed safe region while fulfilling a quantified probabilistic bound. To achieve this, our method reformulates the safety constraints as a sum-of-squares optimization program, enabling the systematic construction of Krasovskii CBC together with their associated safety controllers. We validate the proposed framework through three case studies, including two physical systems, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical applicability.

Title: Structured Learning for Electromagnetic Field Modeling and Real-Time Inversion
Authors: Antonio Bernardes, Jasan Zughaibi, Michael Muehlebach, Bradley J. Nelson
Abstract: Precise magnetic field modeling is fundamental to the closed-loop control of electromagnetic navigation systems (eMNS) and the analytical Multipole Expansion Model (MPEM) is the current standard. However, the MPEM relies on strict physical assumptions regarding source symmetry and isolation, and requires optimization-based calibration that is highly sensitive to initialization. These constraints limit its applicability to systems with complex or irregular coil geometries. This work introduces an alternative modeling paradigm based on multi-layer perceptrons that learns nonlinear magnetic mappings while strictly preserving the linear dependence on currents. As a result, the field models enable fast, closed-form minimum-norm inversion with evaluation times of approximately 1 ms, which is critical for high-bandwidth magnetic control. For model training and evaluation we use large-scale, high-density datasets collected from the research-grade OctoMag and clinical-grade Navion systems. Our results demonstrate that data-driven models achieve predictive fidelity equivalent to the MPEM while maintaining comparable data efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate that straightforward design choices effectively eliminate spurious workspace ill-conditioning frequently reported in MPEM-based calibration. To facilitate future research, we release the complete codebase and datasets open source.

Title: Efficient and Robust Modeling of Nonlinear Mechanical Systems
Authors: Davide Tebaldi, Roberto Zanasi
Abstract: The development of efficient and robust dynamic models is fundamental in the field of systems and control engineering. In this paper, a new formulation for the dynamic model of nonlinear mechanical systems, that can be applied to different automotive and robotic case studies, is proposed, together with a modeling procedure allowing to automatically obtain the model formulation. Compared with the Euler-Lagrange formulation, the proposed model is shown to give superior performances in terms of robustness against measurement noise for systems exhibiting dependence on some external variables, as well as in terms of execution time when computing the inverse dynamics of the system.

Title: Lightweight Pilot Estimation on LEO Satellite Signals for Enhanced SOP Navigation
Authors: Francesco Zanirato, Alessio Curzio, Francesco Ardizzon, Elisa Sbalchiero, Luca Canzian, Stefano Tomasin, Nicola Laurenti, Jaron Samson
Abstract: The computation of positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) via signal of opportunity (SOP), where signals originally transmitted for communication, such as 5G, Wi-Fi, or DVB-S, are exploited due to their ubiquity and spectral characteristics, is an emerging research field. However, relying on these signals presents challenges, including limited knowledge of the signal modulation and the need to identify recurring sequences for correlation. We offer a guide to implement a receiver capable of capturing broadband downlink Ku-band signals from low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites (e.g., Starlink and OneWeb) and estimating the recurring symbols for SOP measurements. The methodology integrates recent approaches in the literature, highlighting the most effective aspects while guiding the replication of experiments even under limitations on the front-end gain and bandwidth. Using the proposed model, we can identify recurring symbols transmitted by Starlink satellites, which are then used to collect Doppler shift measurements over a 600 s interval. A position, velocity, and time (PVT) solution is also computed via least squares (LS), which achieves a positioning error of approximately 268 m after a post-fit refinement.

Title: Multi-Functional RIS-enabled Radar and Communication Coexistence: Channel Modeling and a Sub-6 GHz Indoor Measurement Campaign
Authors: Anton Tishchenko, Demos Serghiou, Hamidreza Taghvaee, Arman Shojaeifard, Ahmed Elzanaty, Gabriele Gradoni, Mohsen Khalily, Rahim Tafazolli
Abstract: In this work, we analyze a multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surface (MF-RIS)-enabled radar and communication coexistence (RCC) system, detailing the key aspects of its phase synthesis codebook generation and the implemented localization algorithm for real-time user tracking based on density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), which features a Kalman filter for the prediction of user mobility. We derived a 3GPP-compatible radar cross-section (RCS) and re-radiation pattern-based channel model for the described MF-RIS system, supplementing it with channel measurements. We obtained large and small-scale characteristics, including path loss, shadow fading, Rician K-factor, cluster powers, and RMS delay spread. The study finds that Sub-6 GHz indoor propagation is largely free of blind spots, even with a blocked line-of-sight (LoS) path. Therefore, the proposed channel model includes non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths, including the ones created by the MF-RIS. We also performed an experimental evaluation of the channel throughput in a fifth generation (5G) new radio (NR) single user multiple-input-multiple-output (SU-MIMO) system, reporting a 74\% reduction in throughput variance and a 12.5\% sum-rate improvement within the MF-RIS near-field compared to the no-RIS setup. This result shows that the MF-RIS can minimize delay spread and increase the coherence bandwidth by creating virtual-LoS (vLoS) path for the moving user, thereby effectively hardening wireless MIMO channels.

Title: Orientation-Robust Latent Motion Trajectory Learning for Annotation-free Cardiac Phase Detection in Fetal Echocardiography
Authors: Yingyu Yang, Qianye Yang, Can Peng, Elena D'Alberti, Olga Patey, Aris T. Papageorghiou, J.Alison Noble
Abstract: Fetal echocardiography is essential for detecting congenital heart disease (CHD), facilitating pregnancy management, optimized delivery planning, and timely postnatal interventions. Among standard imaging planes, the four-chamber (4CH) view provides comprehensive information for CHD diagnosis, where clinicians carefully inspect the end-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) phases to evaluate cardiac structure and motion. Automated detection of these cardiac phases is thus a critical component toward fully automated CHD analysis. Yet, in the absence of fetal electrocardiography (ECG), manual identification of ED and ES frames remains a labor-intensive bottleneck. We present ORBIT (Orientation-Robust Beat Inference from Trajectories), a self-supervised framework that identifies cardiac phases without manual annotations under various fetal heart orientation. ORBIT employs registration as self-supervision task and learns a latent motion trajectory of cardiac deformation, whose turning points capture transitions between cardiac relaxation and contraction, enabling accurate and orientation-robust localization of ED and ES frames across diverse fetal positions. Trained exclusively on normal fetal echocardiography videos, ORBIT achieves consistent performance on both normal (MAE = 1.9 frames for ED and 1.6 for ES) and CHD cases (MAE = 2.4 frames for ED and 2.1 for ES), outperforming existing annotation-free approaches constrained by fixed orientation assumptions. These results highlight the potential of ORBIT to facilitate robust cardiac phase detection directly from 4CH fetal echocardiography.

Title: UnifSrv: AP Selection for Achieving Uniformly Good Performance of CF-MIMO in Realistic Urban Networks
Authors: Yunlu Xiao, Marina Petrova, Ljiljana Simić
Abstract: Under the ideal assumption of uniform propagation, cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) provides uniformly high throughput over the network by effectively surrounding each user with its serving access point (AP) set. However, in realistic non-uniform urban propagation environments, it is difficult to consistently select good limited serving AP sets, resulting in significantly degraded throughput, reintroducing "edge-effect" for the worst-served users. To restore the uniformly good performance of scalable CF-mMIMO in realistic urban networks, we formulate a novel multi-objective optimization problem to jointly achieve high throughput by maximizing the sum data rate, uniform throughput by maximizing Jain's fairness index of the throughput per user, and scalability by minimizing the serving AP set size. We then propose the UnifSrv AP selection algorithms to solve this optimization problem, consisting of a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm UnifSrv-DRL and a heuristic algorithm UnifSrv-heu. We conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation of scalable CF-mMIMO under realistic urban network distributions, propagation, and mobility patterns, showing that the prior benchmark AP selection schemes fail to provide uniformly high throughput in practice. By contrast, UnifSrv at least doubles the throughput compared to prior benchmarks, or achieves comparable throughput but with half of the serving AP set size. Importantly, our heuristic algorithm achieves equivalent throughput to our DRL one, but with orders of magnitude lower complexity. We thus for the first time propose an AP selection algorithm that achieves uniformly good CF-mMIMO performance in realistic urban networks with low complexity.

Title: On the Design of an Optimal Multi-Tone Jammer Against the Wiener Interpolation Filter
Authors: Corentin Fonteneau (IETR, INSA Rennes, UR)
Abstract: In the context of civilian and military communications, anti-jamming techniques are essential to ensure information integrity in the presence of malicious interference. A conventional time-domain approach relies on computing the Wiener interpolation filter to estimate and suppress the jamming waveform from the received samples. It is widely acknowledged that this method is effective for protecting wideband systems against narrowband interference. In this work, this paradigm is questioned through the design of a $K$-tone jamming waveform that is intrinsically difficult to estimate assuming a $L$-tap Wiener interpolation filter. This design relies on an optimization procedure that maximizes the analytical Bayesian mean squared error associated with the jamming waveform estimate. Additionally, an analytical proof is provided showing that a multi-tone jamming waveform composed of $L/2+1$ tones is sufficient to render the Wiener-filter-based anti-jamming module completely ineffective. The analytical results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations assuming both perfect knowledge and practical estimates of the correlation functions of the received signal.

Title: Bridging 6G IoT and AI: LLM-Based Efficient Approach for Physical Layer's Optimization Tasks
Authors: Ahsan Mehmood, Naveed Ul Hassan, Ghassan M. Kraidy
Abstract: This paper investigates the role of large language models (LLMs) in sixth-generation (6G) Internet of Things (IoT) networks and proposes a prompt-engineering-based real-time feedback and verification (PE-RTFV) framework that perform physical-layer's optimization tasks through an iteratively process. By leveraging the naturally available closed-loop feedback inherent in wireless communication systems, PE-RTFV enables real-time physical-layer optimization without requiring model retraining. The proposed framework employs an optimization LLM (O-LLM) to generate task-specific structured prompts, which are provided to an agent LLM (A-LLM) to produce task-specific solutions. Utilizing real-time system feedback, the O-LLM iteratively refines the prompts to guide the A-LLM toward improved solutions in a gradient-descent-like optimization process. We test PE-RTFV approach on wireless-powered IoT testbed case study on user-goal-driven constellation design through semantically solving rate-energy (RE)-region optimization problem which demonstrates that PE-RTFV achieves near-genetic-algorithm performance within only a few iterations, validating its effectiveness for complex physical-layer optimization tasks in resource-constrained IoT networks.

Authors: Sumit Kumar, Suraj Jaiswal, Parampreet Singh, Vipul Arora
Abstract: The advancement of machine learning in audio analysis has opened new possibilities for technology-enhanced music education. This paper introduces a framework for automatic singing mistake detection in the context of music pedagogy, supported by a newly curated dataset. The dataset comprises synchronized teacher learner vocal recordings, with annotations marking different types of mistakes made by learners. Using this dataset, we develop different deep learning models for mistake detection and benchmark them. To compare the efficacy of mistake detection systems, a new evaluation methodology is proposed. Experiments indicate that the proposed learning-based methods are superior to rule-based methods. A systematic study of errors and a cross-teacher study reveal insights into music pedagogy that can be utilised for various music applications. This work sets out new directions of research in music pedagogy. The codes and dataset are publicly available.

Title: The Combination of Several Decorrelation Methods to Improve Acoustic Feedback Cancellation
Authors: Klaus Linhard, Philipp Bulling
Abstract: This paper extends an acoustic feedback cancellation system by incorporating multiple decorrelation methods. The baseline system is based on a frequency-domain Kalman filter implemented in a multi-delay structure. The proposed extensions include a variable time delay line, prediction, distortion compensation, and a simplified reverberation model. Each extension is analyzed, and a practical parameter range is defined. While existing literature often focuses on a single extension, such as prediction, to describe an optimal system, this work demonstrates that each individual extension contributes to performance improvements. Furthermore, the combination of all proposed extensions results in a superior system. The evaluation is conducted using publicly available datasets, with performance assessed through system distance metrics and the objective speech quality measure PSEQ.

Title: Optimal Derivative Feedback Control for an Active Magnetic Levitation System: An Experimental Study on Data-Driven Approaches
Authors: Saber Omidi, Rene Akupan Ebunle, Se Young Yoon
Abstract: This paper presents the design and implementation of data-driven optimal derivative feedback controllers for an active magnetic levitation system. A direct, model-free control design method based on the reinforcement learning framework is compared with an indirect optimal control design derived from a numerically identified mathematical model of the system. For the direct model-free approach, a policy iteration procedure is proposed, which adds an iteration layer called the epoch loop to gather multiple sets of process data, providing a more diverse dataset and helping reduce learning biases. This direct control design method is evaluated against a comparable optimal control solution designed from a plant model obtained through the combined Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control (DMDc) and Prediction Error Minimization (PEM) system identification. Results show that while both controllers can stabilize and improve the performance of the magnetic levitation system when compared to controllers designed from a nominal model, the direct model-free approach consistently outperforms the indirect solution when multiple epochs are allowed. The iterative refinement of the optimal control law over the epoch loop provides the direct approach a clear advantage over the indirect method, which relies on a single set of system data to determine the identified model and control.

Title: Dynamic Motion/Force Control of Mobile Manipulators via Extended-UDE
Authors: Songqun Gao, Wendi Ding, Maotong Cheng, Qinyuan Ren, Ben M. Chen
Abstract: Mobile manipulators are known for their superior mobility over manipulators on fixed bases, offering promising applications in smart industry and housekeeping scenarios. The dynamic coupling nature between the mobile base and the manipulator presents challenges for force interactive tasks of the mobile manipulator. However, current strategies often fail to account for this coupling in such scenarios. To address this, this paper presents a dynamic coupling-integrated manipulator model that requires only the manipulator dynamics and the mobile base kinematics, which simplifies the modeling process. In addition, embedding the dynamic model, an extended uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE) is proposed for the mobile manipulator, which separately estimates the dynamic coupling terms and other unmodeled uncertainties, incorporating them into the feedforward and feedback control loops, respectively. The proposed approach increases the speed of response of the system and improves the dynamic robot-environment interaction (REI) performance of the mobile manipulator. A series of simulations and experiments of a wall-cleaning task are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Ablation studies demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves the motion/force tracking performance when the mobile base is in dynamic motion.

Title: UAV-Mounted Aerial Relays in Military Communications: A Comprehensive Survey
Authors: Faisal Al-Kamali, Francois Chan, Hussein A. Ammar, James H. Bayes, Claude D'Amours
Abstract: Relays are pivotal in military communication networks, expanding coverage and ensuring reliable connectivity in challenging operational environments. While traditional terrestrial relays (TR) are constrained by fixed locations and vulnerability to physical obstructions, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted aerial relays (AR) offer a dynamic and flexible alternative by operating above obstacles and adapting to changing battlefield conditions. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of AR systems in military communications, presenting a detailed comparison between AR and TR paradigms and examining two specific AR technologies: active aerial relays (AAR) and aerial reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS) relays. The survey delves into their operation, benefits, challenges, and military applications, supported by a qualitative analysis across metrics such as coverage, flexibility, security, and cost. A novel multi-dimensional metric, the mission-critical relay effectiveness score (MCRES), is introduced as a quantitative method for evaluating relay suitability based on mission-specific weights for critical attributes like mobility, jamming resilience, deployment speed, stealth, coverage, and autonomy. Furthermore, we present Algorithm 1, a decision-making framework that leverages the MCRES to guide the systematic selection of the optimal relay type, AR or TR, and subsequently AAR or ARIS, tailored to the unique demands of a given military scenario, such as dynamic battlefield operations, electronic warfare, or covert missions. Finally, the paper addresses current implementation challenges and outlines promising future research directions to advance the deployment of robust and resilient UAV-mounted relay systems in contested military environments.

Title: Computationally Efficient Laplacian CL-colME
Authors: Nikola Stankovic
Abstract: Decentralized collaborative mean estimation (colME) is a fundamental task in heterogeneous networks. Its graph-based variants B-colME and C-colME achieve high scalability of the problem. This paper evaluates the consensus-based C-colME framework, which relies on doubly stochastic averaging matrices to ensure convergence to the oracle solution. We propose CL-colME, a novel variant utilizing Laplacian-based consensus to avoid the computationally expensive normalization processes. Simulation results show that the proposed CL-colME maintains the convergence behavior and accuracy of C-colME while improving computational efficiency.

Title: Dynamic Modeling, Parameter Identification and Numerical Analysis of Flexible Cables in Flexibly Connected Dual-AUV Systems
Authors: Kuo Chen, Minghao Dou, Qianqi Liu, Yang An, Kai Ren, Zeming WU, Yu Tian, Jie Sun, Xinping Wang, Zhier Chen, Jiancheng Yu
Abstract: This research presents a dynamic modeling framework and parameter identification methods for describing the highly nonlinear behaviors of flexibly connected dual-AUV systems. The modeling framework is established based on the lumped mass method, integrating axial elasticity, bending stiffness, added mass and hydrodynamic forces, thereby accurately capturing the time-varying response of the forces and cable configurations. To address the difficulty of directly measuring material-related and hydrodynamic coefficients, this research proposes a parameter identification method that combines the physical model with experimental data. High-precision inversion of the equivalent Youngs modulus and hydrodynamic coefficients is performed through tension experiments under multiple configurations, effectively demonstrating that the identified model maintains predictive consistency in various operational conditions. Further numerical analysis indicates that the dynamic properties of flexible cable exhibit significant nonlinear characteristics, which are highly dependent on material property variations and AUV motion conditions. This nonlinear dynamic behavior results in two typical response states, slack and taut, which are jointly determined by boundary conditions and hydrodynamic effects, significantly affecting the cable configuration and endpoint loads. In this research, the dynamics of flexible cables under complex boundary conditions is revealed, providing a theoretical foundation for the design, optimization and further control research of similar systems.

Title: Active Localization of Unstable Systems with Coarse Information
Authors: Ege Yuceel, Daniel Liberzon, Sayan Mitra
Abstract: We study localization and control for unstable systems under coarse, single-bit sensing. Motivated by understanding the fundamental limitations imposed by such minimal feedback, we identify sufficient conditions under which the initial state can be recovered despite instability and extremely sparse measurements. Building on these conditions, we develop an active localization algorithm that integrates a set-based estimator with a control strategy derived from Voronoi partitions, which provably estimates the initial state while ensuring the agent remains in informative regions. Under the derived conditions, the proposed approach guarantees exponential contraction of the initial-state uncertainty, and the result is further supported by numerical experiments. These findings can offer theoretical insight into localization in robotics, where sensing is often limited to coarse abstractions such as keyframes, segmentations, or line-based features.

Title: Chasing Tails: How Do People Respond to Wait Time Distributions?
Authors: Evgeny Kagan, Kyle Hyndman, Andrew Davis
Abstract: We use a series of pre-registered, incentive-compatible online experiments to investigate how people evaluate and choose among different waiting time distributions. Our main findings are threefold. First, consistent with prior literature, people show an aversion to both longer expected waits and higher variance. Second, and more surprisingly, moment-based utility models fail to capture preferences when distributions have thick-right tails: indeed, decision-makers strongly prefer distributions with long-right tails (where probability mass is more evenly distributed over a larger support set) relative to tails that exhibit a spike near the maximum possible value, even when controlling for mean, variance, and higher moments. Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) utility models commonly used in portfolio theory predict these choices well. Third, when given a choice, decision-makers overwhelmingly seek information about right-tail outcomes. These results have practical implications for service operations: (1) service designs that create a spike in long waiting times (such as priority or dedicated queue designs) may be particularly aversive; (2) when informativeness is the goal, providers should prioritize sharing right-tail probabilities or percentiles; and (3) to increase service uptake, providers can strategically disclose (or withhold) distributional information depending on right-tail shape.

Title: Misophonia Trigger Sound Detection on Synthetic Soundscapes Using a Hybrid Model with a Frozen Pre-Trained CNN and a Time-Series Module
Authors: Kurumi Sashida, Gouhei Tanaka
Abstract: Misophonia is a disorder characterized by a decreased tolerance to specific everyday sounds (trigger sounds) that can evoke intense negative emotional responses such as anger, panic, or anxiety. These reactions can substantially impair daily functioning and quality of life. Assistive technologies that selectively detect trigger sounds could help reduce distress and improve well-being. In this study, we investigate sound event detection (SED) to localize intervals of trigger sounds in continuous environmental audio as a foundational step toward such assistive support. Motivated by the scarcity of real-world misophonia data, we generate synthetic soundscapes tailored to misophonia trigger sound detection using audio synthesis techniques. Then, we perform trigger sound detection tasks using hybrid CNN-based models. The models combine feature extraction using a frozen pre-trained CNN backbone with a trainable time-series module such as gated recurrent units (GRUs), long short-term memories (LSTMs), echo state networks (ESNs), and their bidirectional variants. The detection performance is evaluated using common SED metrics, including Polyphonic Sound Detection Score 1 (PSDS1). On the multi-class trigger SED task, bidirectional temporal modeling consistently improves detection performance, with Bidirectional GRU (BiGRU) achieving the best overall accuracy. Notably, the Bidirectional ESN (BiESN) attains competitive performance while requiring orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters by optimizing only the readout. We further simulate user personalization via a few-shot "eating sound" detection task with at most five support clips, in which BiGRU and BiESN are compared. In this strict adaptation setting, BiESN shows robust and stable performance, suggesting that lightweight temporal modules are promising for personalized misophonia trigger SED.

Title: Nipping the Drift in the Bud: Retrospective Rectification for Robust Vision-Language Navigation
Authors: Gang He, Zhenyang Liu, Kepeng Xu, Li Xu, Tong Qiao, Wenxin Yu, Chang Wu, Weiying Xie
Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) requires embodied agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate through complex continuous 3D environments. However, the dominant imitation learning paradigm suffers from exposure bias, where minor deviations during inference lead to compounding errors. While DAgger-style approaches attempt to mitigate this by correcting error states, we identify a critical limitation: Instruction-State Misalignment. Forcing an agent to learn recovery actions from off-track states often creates supervision signals that semantically conflict with the original instruction. In response to these challenges, we introduce BudVLN, an online framework that learns from on-policy rollouts by constructing supervision to match the current state distribution. BudVLN performs retrospective rectification via counterfactual re-anchoring and decision-conditioned supervision synthesis, using a geodesic oracle to synthesize corrective trajectories that originate from valid historical states, ensuring semantic consistency. Experiments on the standard R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks demonstrate that BudVLN consistently mitigates distribution shift and achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Success Rate and SPL.

Title: A Consistency-Improved LiDAR-Inertial Bundle Adjustment
Authors: Xinran Li, Shuaikang Zheng, Pengcheng Zheng, Xinyang Wang, Jiacheng Li, Zhitian Li, Xudong Zou
Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using 3D LiDAR has emerged as a cornerstone for autonomous navigation in robotics. While feature-based SLAM systems have achieved impressive results by leveraging edge and planar structures, they often suffer from the inconsistent estimator associated with feature parameterization and estimated covariance. In this work, we present a consistency-improved LiDAR-inertial bundle adjustment (BA) with tailored parameterization and estimator. First, we propose a stereographic-projection representation parameterizing the planar and edge features, and conduct a comprehensive observability analysis to support its integrability with consistent estimator. Second, we implement a LiDAR-inertial BA with Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) formulation and First-Estimate Jacobians (FEJ) to preserve the accurate estimated covariance and observability properties of the system. Last, we apply our proposed BA method to a LiDAR-inertial odometry.

Title: Scaling Speech Tokenizers with Diffusion Autoencoders
Authors: Yuancheng Wang, Zhenyu Tang, Yun Wang, Arthur Hinsvark, Yingru Liu, Yinghao Li, Kainan Peng, Junyi Ao, Mingbo Ma, Mike Seltzer, Qing He, Xubo Liu
Abstract: Speech tokenizers are foundational to speech language models, yet existing approaches face two major challenges: (1) balancing trade-offs between encoding semantics for understanding and acoustics for reconstruction, and (2) achieving low bit rates and low token rates. We propose Speech Diffusion Tokenizer (SiTok), a diffusion autoencoder that jointly learns semantic-rich representations through supervised learning and enables high-fidelity audio reconstruction with diffusion. We scale SiTok to 1.6B parameters and train it on 2 million hours of speech. Experiments show that SiTok outperforms strong baselines on understanding, reconstruction and generation tasks, at an extremely low token rate of $12.5$ Hz and a bit-rate of 200 bits-per-second.

Title: Force Generative Imitation Learning: Bridging Position Trajectory and Force Commands through Control Technique
Authors: Hiroshi Sato, Sho Sakaino, Toshiaki Tsuji
Abstract: In contact-rich tasks, while position trajectories are often easy to obtain, appropriate force commands are typically unknown. Although it is conceivable to generate force commands using a pretrained foundation model such as Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, force control is highly dependent on the specific hardware of the robot, which makes the application of such models challenging. To bridge this gap, we propose a force generative model that estimates force commands from given position trajectories. However, when dealing with unseen position trajectories, the model struggles to generate accurate force commands. To address this, we introduce a feedback control mechanism. Our experiments reveal that feedback control does not converge when the force generative model has memory. We therefore adopt a model without memory, enabling stable feedback control. This approach allows the system to generate force commands effectively, even for unseen position trajectories, improving generalization for real-world robot writing tasks.

Title: Reading Between the Waves: Robust Topic Segmentation Using Inter-Sentence Audio Features
Authors: Steffen Freisinger, Philipp Seeberger, Tobias Bocklet, Korbinian Riedhammer
Abstract: Spoken content, such as online videos and podcasts, often spans multiple topics, which makes automatic topic segmentation essential for user navigation and downstream applications. However, current methods do not fully leverage acoustic features, leaving room for improvement. We propose a multi-modal approach that fine-tunes both a text encoder and a Siamese audio encoder, capturing acoustic cues around sentence boundaries. Experiments on a large-scale dataset of YouTube videos show substantial gains over text-only and multi-modal baselines. Our model also proves more resilient to ASR noise and outperforms a larger text-only baseline on three additional datasets in Portuguese, German, and English, underscoring the value of learned acoustic features for robust topic segmentation.

Title: AI-Generated Music Detection in Broadcast Monitoring
Authors: David Lopez-Ayala, Asier Cabello, Pablo Zinemanas, Emilio Molina, Martin Rocamora
Abstract: AI music generators have advanced to the point where their outputs are often indistinguishable from human compositions. While detection methods have emerged, they are typically designed and validated in music streaming contexts with clean, full-length tracks. Broadcast audio, however, poses a different challenge: music appears as short excerpts, often masked by dominant speech, conditions under which existing detectors fail. In this work, we introduce AI-OpenBMAT, the first dataset tailored to broadcast-style AI-music detection. It contains 3,294 one-minute audio excerpts (54.9 hours) that follow the duration patterns and loudness relations of real television audio, combining human-made production music with stylistically matched continuations generated with Suno v3.5. We benchmark a CNN baseline and state-of-the-art SpectTTTra models to assess SNR and duration robustness, and evaluate on a full broadcast scenario. Across all settings, models that excel in streaming scenarios suffer substantial degradation, with F1-scores dropping below 60% when music is in the background or has a short duration. These results highlight speech masking and short music length as critical open challenges for AI music detection, and position AI-OpenBMAT as a benchmark for developing detectors capable of meeting industrial broadcast requirements.

Title: Reciprocal Latent Fields for Precomputed Sound Propagation
Authors: Hugo Seuté, Pranai Vasudev, Etienne Richan, Louis-Xavier Buffoni
Abstract: Realistic sound propagation is essential for immersion in a virtual scene, yet physically accurate wave-based simulations remain computationally prohibitive for real-time applications. Wave coding methods address this limitation by precomputing and compressing impulse responses of a given scene into a set of scalar acoustic parameters, which can reach unmanageable sizes in large environments with many source-receiver pairs. We introduce Reciprocal Latent Fields (RLF), a memory-efficient framework for encoding and predicting these acoustic parameters. The RLF framework employs a volumetric grid of trainable latent embeddings decoded with a symmetric function, ensuring acoustic reciprocity. We study a variety of decoders and show that leveraging Riemannian metric learning leads to a better reproduction of acoustic phenomena in complex scenes. Experimental validation demonstrates that RLF maintains replication quality while reducing the memory footprint by several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, a MUSHRA-like subjective listening test indicates that sound rendered via RLF is perceptually indistinguishable from ground-truth simulations.

Title: EEG-MACS: Manifold Attention and Confidence Stratification for EEG-based Cross-Center Brain Disease Diagnosis under Unreliable Annotations
Authors: Zhenxi Song, Ruihan Qin, Huixia Ren, Zhen Liang, Yi Guo, Min Zhang, Zhiguo Zhang
Abstract: Cross-center data heterogeneity and annotation unreliability significantly challenge the intelligent diagnosis of diseases using brain signals. A notable example is the EEG-based diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, which features subtler abnormal neural dynamics typically observed in small-group settings. To advance this area, in this work, we introduce a transferable framework employing Manifold Attention and Confidence Stratification (MACS) to diagnose neurodegenerative disorders based on EEG signals sourced from four centers with unreliable annotations. The MACS framework's effectiveness stems from these features: 1) The Augmentor generates various EEG-represented brain variants to enrich the data space; 2) The Switcher enhances the feature space for trusted samples and reduces overfitting on incorrectly labeled samples; 3) The Encoder uses the Riemannian manifold and Euclidean metrics to capture spatiotemporal variations and dynamic synchronization in EEG; 4) The Projector, equipped with dual heads, monitors consistency across multiple brain variants and ensures diagnostic accuracy; 5) The Stratifier adaptively stratifies learned samples by confidence levels throughout the training process; 6) Forward and backpropagation in MACS are constrained by confidence stratification to stabilize the learning system amid unreliable annotations. Our subject-independent experiments, conducted on both neurocognitive and movement disorders using cross-center corpora, have demonstrated superior performance compared to existing related algorithms. This work not only improves EEG-based diagnostics for cross-center and small-setting brain diseases but also offers insights into extending MACS techniques to other data analyses, tackling data heterogeneity and annotation unreliability in multimedia and multimodal content understanding.

Title: DUST: A Framework for Data-Driven Density Steering
Authors: Joshua Pilipovsky, Panagiotis Tsiotras
Abstract: We consider the problem of data-driven stochastic optimal control of an unknown LTI dynamical system. Assuming the process noise is normally distributed, we pose the problem of steering the state's mean and covariance to a target normal distribution, under noisy data collected from the underlying system, a problem commonly referred to as covariance steering (CS). A novel framework for Data-driven Uncertainty quantification and density STeering (DUST) is presented that simultaneously characterizes the noise affecting the measured data and designs an optimal affine-feedback controller to steer the density of the state to a prescribed terminal value. We use both indirect and direct data-driven design approaches based on the notions of persistency of excitation and subspace identification to exactly represent the mean and covariance dynamics of the state in terms of the data and noise realizations. Since both the mean and the covariance steering sub-problems are plagued with stochastic uncertainty arising from noisy data collection, we first estimate the noise realization from this dataset and subsequently compute tractable upper bounds on the estimation errors. The first and second moment steering problems are then solved to optimality using techniques from robust control and robust optimization. Lastly, we present an alternative control design approach based on the certainty equivalence principle and interpret the problem as one of CS under multiplicative uncertainty. We analyze the performance and efficacy of each of these data-driven approaches using a case study and compare them with their model-based counterparts.

Title: Exposing Barriers to Flexibility Aggregation in Unbalanced Distribution Networks
Authors: Andrey Churkin, Wangwei Kong, Pierluigi Mancarella, Eduardo A. Martínez Ceseña
Abstract: The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DER) offers new opportunities for distribution system operators (DSO) to improve network operation through flexibility services. To utilise flexible resources, various DER flexibility aggregation methods have been proposed, such as the concept of aggregated P-Q flexibility areas. Yet, many existing studies assume perfect coordination among DER and rely on single-phase power flow analysis, thus overlooking barriers to flexibility aggregation in real unbalanced systems. To quantify the impact of these barriers, this paper proposes a three-phase optimal power flow (OPF) framework for P-Q flexibility assessment, implemented as an open-source Julia tool this http URL. The framework explicitly accounts for voltage unbalance and imperfect coordination among DER in low voltage (LV) distribution networks. Simulations on an illustrative 5-bus system and a real 221-bus LV network in the UK reveal that over 30% of the theoretical aggregated flexibility potential can be lost due to phase unbalance and lack of coordination across phases. These findings highlight the need for improved flexibility aggregation tools applicable to real unbalanced distribution networks.

Title: Downscaling Neural Network for Coastal Simulations
Authors: Zhi-Song Liu, Markus Büttner, Matthew Scarborough, Eirik Valseth, Vadym Aizinger, Bernhard Kainz, Andreas Rupp
Abstract: Learning the fine-scale details of a coastal ocean simulation from a coarse representation is a challenging task. For real-world applications, high-resolution simulations are necessary to advance understanding of many coastal processes, specifically, to predict flooding resulting from tsunamis and storm surges. We propose a Downscaling Neural Network for Coastal Simulation (DNNCS) for spatiotemporal enhancement to learn the high-resolution numerical solution. Given images of coastal simulations produced on low-resolution computational meshes using low polynomial order discontinuous Galerkin discretizations and a coarse temporal resolution, the proposed DNNCS learns to produce high-resolution free surface elevation and velocity visualizations in both time and space. To model the dynamic changes over time and space, we propose grid-aware spatiotemporal attention to project the temporal features to the spatial domain for non-local feature matching. The coordinate information is also utilized via positional encoding. For the final reconstruction, we use the spatiotemporal bilinear operation to interpolate the missing frames and then expand the feature maps to the frequency domain for residual mapping. Besides data-driven losses, the proposed physics-informed loss guarantees gradient consistency and momentum changes, leading to a 24% reduction in root-mean-square error compared to the model trained with only data-driven losses. To train the proposed model, we propose a coastal simulation dataset and use it for model optimization and evaluation. Our method shows superior downscaling quality and fast computation compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Path Evolution Model for Endogenous Channel Digital Twin towards 6G Wireless Networks
Authors: Haoyu Wang, Zhi Sun, Shuangfeng Han, Xiaoyun Wang, Shidong Zhou, Zhaocheng Wang
Abstract: Massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) is critical for boosting 6G wireless network capacity. Nevertheless, high dimensional Channel State Information (CSI) acquisition becomes the bottleneck of 6G massive MIMO system. Recently, Channel Digital Twin (CDT), which replicates physical entities in wireless channels, has been proposed, providing site-specific prior knowledge for CSI acquisition. However, external devices (e.g., cameras and GPS devices) cannot always be integrated into existing communication systems, nor are they universally available across all scenarios. Moreover, the trained CDT model cannot be directly applied in new environments, which lacks environmental generalizability. To this end, Path Evolution Model (PEM) is proposed as an alternative CDT to reflect physical path evolutions from consecutive channel measurements. Compared to existing CDTs, PEM demonstrates virtues of full endogeneity, self-sustainability and environmental generalizability. Firstly, PEM only requires existing channel measurements, which is free of other hardware devices and can be readily deployed. Secondly, self-sustaining maintenance of PEM can be achieved in dynamic channel by progressive updates. Thirdly, environmental generalizability can greatly reduce deployment costs in dynamic environments. To facilitate the implementation of PEM, an intelligent and light-weighted operation framework is firstly designed. Then, the environmental generalizability of PEM is rigorously analyzed. Next, efficient learning approaches are proposed to reduce the amount of training data practically. Extensive simulation results reveal that PEM can simultaneously achieve high-precision and low-overhead CSI acquisition, which can serve as a fundamental CDT for 6G wireless networks.

Title: Mamba Goes HoME: Hierarchical Soft Mixture-of-Experts for 3D Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Szymon Płotka, Gizem Mert, Maciej Chrabaszcz, Ewa Szczurek, Arkadiusz Sitek
Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence has significantly advanced medical image segmentation. Nonetheless, challenges remain, including efficient 3D medical image processing across diverse modalities and handling data variability. In this work, we introduce Hierarchical Soft Mixture-of-Experts (HoME), a two-level token-routing layer for efficient long-context modeling, specifically designed for 3D medical image segmentation. Built on the Mamba Selective State Space Model (SSM) backbone, HoME enhances sequential modeling through adaptive expert routing. In the first level, a Soft Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) layer partitions input sequences into local groups, routing tokens to specialized per-group experts for localized feature extraction. The second level aggregates these outputs through a global SMoE layer, enabling cross-group information fusion and global context refinement. This hierarchical design, combining local expert routing with global expert refinement, enhances generalizability and segmentation performance, surpassing state-of-the-art results across datasets from the three most widely used 3D medical imaging modalities and varying data qualities. The code is publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Set-Based Control Barrier Functions for Scalable Safety Filter Design
Authors: Kim P. Wabersich, Felix Berkel, Felix Gruber, Sven Reimann
Abstract: Industrial control applications require high performance under strict constraints. Control barrier functions (CBFs) provide principled safety mechanisms, but constructing CBF-based safety filters for large-scale systems is challenging. We introduce set-based CBFs for linear systems with convex constraints by defining the barrier via the Minkowski functional of a control invariant set. This invariant set can be obtained from scalable computations, including reachability analysis and model predictive control (MPC). The approach yields tunable safety filters with dampened intervention and asymptotic stability of the set of safe states. We derive reformulations embedding set-based CBF constraints into convex optimization for common set representations and present learning-based approximations reducing runtime while preserving safety. We demonstrate the approach through simulations on a high-dimensional system and a motion control task, and validate the method experimentally on an electric drive with short sampling times.

Title: Mamba-FCS: Joint Spatio- Frequency Feature Fusion, Change-Guided Attention, and SeK Loss for Enhanced Semantic Change Detection in Remote Sensing
Authors: Buddhi Wijenayake, Athulya Ratnayake, Praveen Sumanasekara, Roshan Godaliyadda, Parakrama Ekanayake, Vijitha Herath, Nichula Wasalathilaka
Abstract: Semantic Change Detection (SCD) from remote sensing imagery requires models balancing extensive spatial context, computational efficiency, and sensitivity to class-imbalanced land-cover transitions. While Convolutional Neural Networks excel at local feature extraction but lack global context, Transformers provide global modeling at high computational costs. Recent Mamba architectures based on state-space models offer compelling solutions through linear complexity and efficient long-range modeling. In this study, we introduce Mamba-FCS, a SCD framework built upon Visual State Space Model backbone incorporating, a Joint Spatio-Frequency Fusion block incorporating log-amplitude frequency domain features to enhance edge clarity and suppress illumination artifacts, a Change-Guided Attention (CGA) module that explicitly links the naturally intertwined BCD and SCD tasks, and a Separated Kappa (SeK) loss tailored for class-imbalanced performance optimization. Extensive evaluation on SECOND and Landsat-SCD datasets shows that Mamba-FCS achieves state-of-the-art metrics, 88.62% Overall Accuracy, 65.78% F_scd, and 25.50% SeK on SECOND, 96.25% Overall Accuracy, 89.27% F_scd, and 60.26% SeK on Landsat-SCD. Ablation analyses confirm distinct contributions of each novel component, with qualitative assessments highlighting significant improvements in SCD. Our results underline the substantial potential of Mamba architectures, enhanced by proposed techniques, setting a new benchmark for effective and scalable semantic change detection in remote sensing applications. The complete source code, configuration files, and pre-trained models will be publicly available upon publication.

Title: Reservoir Predictive Path Integral Control for Unknown Nonlinear Dynamics
Authors: Daisuke Inoue, Tadayoshi Matsumori, Gouhei Tanaka, Yuji Ito
Abstract: Neural networks have found extensive application in data-driven control of nonlinear dynamical systems, yet fast online identification and control of unknown dynamics remain central challenges. To meet these challenges, this paper integrates echo-state networks (ESNs)--reservoir computing models implemented with recurrent neural networks--and model predictive path integral (MPPI) control--sampling-based variants of model predictive control. The proposed reservoir predictive path integral (RPPI) enables fast learning of nonlinear dynamics with ESNs and exploits the learned nonlinearities directly in MPPI control computation without linearization approximations. This framework is further extended to uncertainty-aware RPPI (URPPI), which achieves robust stochastic control by treating ESN output weights as random variables and minimizing an expected cost over their distribution to account for identification errors. Experiments on controlling a Duffing oscillator and a four-tank system demonstrate that URPPI improves control performance, reducing control costs by up to 60% compared to traditional quadratic programming-based model predictive control methods.

Title: Time-Frequency Analysis of Non-Uniformly Sampled Signals via Sample Density Adaptation
Authors: Ashwini Kulkarni, Santosh Nannuru
Abstract: The analysis of non-stationary signals in non-uniformly sampled data is a challenging task. Time-integrated methods, such as the generalised Lomb-Scargle (GLS) periodogram, provide a robust statistical assessment of persistent periodicities but are insensitive to transient events. Conversely, existing time-frequency methods often rely on fixed-duration windows or interpolation, which can be suboptimal for non-uniform data. We introduce the non-uniform Stockwell-transform (NUST), a time-frequency framework that applies a localized density adaptive spectral analysis directly to non-uniformly sampled data. NUST employs a doubly adaptive window that adjusts its width based on both frequency and local data density, providing detailed time-frequency information for both transient and persistent signals. We validate the NUST on numerous non-uniformly sampled synthetic signals, demonstrating its superior time-localization performance compared to GLS. Furthermore, we apply NUST to HARPS radial velocity data of the multi-planetary system HD 10180, successfully distinguishing coherent planetary signals from stellar activity.

Title: Detection and Identification of Sensor Attacks Using Partially Attack-Free Data
Authors: Takumi Shinohara, Karl H. Johansson, Henrik Sandberg
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate data-driven attack detection and identification in a model-free setting. We consider a practically motivated scenario in which the available dataset may be compromised by malicious sensor attacks, but contains an unknown, contiguous, partially attack-free interval. The control input is assumed to include a small stochastic watermarking signal. Under these assumptions, we establish sufficient conditions for attack detection and identification from partially attack-free data. We also develop data-driven detection and identification procedures and characterize their computational complexity. Notably, the proposed framework does not impose a limit on the number of compromised sensors; thus, it can detect and identify attacks even when all sensor outputs are compromised outside the attack-free interval, provided that the attack-free interval is sufficiently long. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework via numerical simulations.

Title: Learning a distance measure from the information-estimation geometry of data
Authors: Guy Ohayon, Pierre-Etienne H. Fiquet, Florentin Guth, Jona Ballé, Eero P. Simoncelli
Abstract: We introduce the Information-Estimation Metric (IEM), a novel form of distance function derived from an underlying continuous probability density over a domain of signals. The IEM is rooted in a fundamental relationship between information theory and estimation theory, which links the log-probability of a signal with the errors of an optimal denoiser, applied to noisy observations of the signal. In particular, the IEM between a pair of signals is obtained by comparing their denoising error vectors over a range of noise amplitudes. Geometrically, this amounts to comparing the score vector fields of the blurred density around the signals over a range of blur levels. We prove that the IEM is a valid global distance metric and derive a closed-form expression for its local second-order approximation, which yields a Riemannian metric. For Gaussian-distributed signals, the IEM coincides with the Mahalanobis distance. But for more complex distributions, it adapts, both locally and globally, to the geometry of the distribution. In practice, the IEM can be computed using a learned denoiser (analogous to generative diffusion models) and solving a one-dimensional integral. To demonstrate the value of our framework, we learn an IEM on the ImageNet database. Experiments show that this IEM is competitive with or outperforms state-of-the-art supervised image quality metrics in predicting human perceptual judgments.

Title: Enhanced Ground-Satellite Direct Access via Onboard Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers
Authors: Qihao Peng, Tierui Gong, Zihang Song, Qu Luo, Zihuai Lin, Pei Xiao, Chau Yuen
Abstract: Ground-satellite links for 6G networks face critical challenges, including severe path loss, tight size-weight-power limits, and congested spectrum, all of which significantly hinder the performance of traditional radio frequency (RF) front ends. This article introduces the Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receiver (RAQR) for onboard satellite systems, a millimeter-scale front end that converts radio fields to optical signals through atomic electromagnetically induced transparency. RAQR's high sensitivity and high frequency selectivity address link budget, payload, and interference challenges while fitting within space constraints. A hybrid atomic-electronic design and supporting signal model demonstrate enhanced data rate, coverage, and sensing accuracy relative to conventional RF receivers. The article concludes with integration strategies, distributed-satellite concepts, and open research problems for bringing RAQR-enabled satellite payloads into service.

Title: Optimal RIS Placement in Multi-User MISO Systems with User Randomness
Authors: Abhishek Rajasekaran, Mehdi Karbalayghareh, Xiaoyan Ma, David J. Love, Christopher G. Brinton
Abstract: It is well established that the performance of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted systems critically depends on the optimal placement of the RIS. Previous works consider either simple coverage maximization or simultaneous optimization of the placement of the RIS along with the beamforming and reflection coefficients, most of which assume that the location of the RIS, base station (BS), and users are known. However, in practice, only the spatial variation of user density and obstacle configuration are likely to be known prior to deployment of the system. Thus, we formulate a non-convex problem that optimizes the position of the RIS over the expected minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the system with user randomness, assuming that the system employs joint beamforming after deployment. To solve this problem, we propose a recursive coarse-to-fine methodology that constructs a set of candidate locations for RIS placement based on the obstacle configuration and evaluates them over multiple instantiations from the user distribution. The search is recursively refined within the optimal region identified in each stage to determine the final optimal region for RIS deployment. Detailed numerical results are presented to corroborate our findings.

Abstract: Retinal neovascularization (RNV) is a vision threatening development in diabetic retinopathy (DR). Vision loss associated with RNV is preventable with timely intervention, making RNV clinical screening and monitoring a priority. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography (OCTA) provides high-resolution imaging and high-sensitivity detection of RNV lesions. With recent commercial devices introducing widefield OCTA imaging to the clinic, the technology stands to improve early detection of RNV pathology. However, to meet clinical requirements these imaging capabilities must be combined with effective RNV detection and quantification, but existing algorithms for OCTA images are optimized for conventional, i.e. narrow, fields of view. Here, we present a novel approach for RNV diagnosis and staging on widefield OCT/OCTA. Unlike conventional methods dependent on multi-layer retinal segmentation, our model reframes RNV identification as a direct binary localization task. Our fully automated approach was trained and validated on 589 widefield scans (17x17-mm to 26x21-mm) collected from multiple devices at multiple clinics. Our method achieved a device-dependent area under curve (AUC) ranging from 0.96 to 0.99 for RNV diagnosis, and mean intersection over union (IOU) ranging from 0.76 to 0.88 for segmentation. We also demonstrate our method's ability to monitor lesion growth longitudinally. Our results indicate that deep learning-based analysis for widefield OCTA images could offer a valuable means for improving RNV screening and management.

Title: Generalizable Learning for Massive MIMO CSI Feedback in Unseen Environments
Authors: Haoyu Wang, Zhi Sun, Shuangfeng Han, Xiaoyun Wang, Zhaocheng Wang
Abstract: Deep learning is promising to enhance the accuracy and reduce the overhead of channel state information (CSI) feedback, which can boost the capacity of frequency division duplex (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Nevertheless, the generalizability of current deep learning-based CSI feedback algorithms cannot be guaranteed in unseen environments, which induces a high deployment cost. In this paper, the generalizability of deep learning-based CSI feedback is promoted with physics interpretation. Firstly, the distribution shift of the cluster-based channel is modeled, which comprises the multi-cluster structure and single-cluster response. Secondly, the physics-based distribution alignment is proposed to effectively address the distribution shift of the cluster-based channel, which comprises multi-cluster decoupling and fine-grained alignment. Thirdly, the efficiency and robustness of physics-based distribution alignment are enhanced. Explicitly, an efficient multi-cluster decoupling algorithm is proposed based on the Eckart-Young-Mirsky (EYM) theorem to support real-time CSI feedback. Meanwhile, a hybrid criterion to estimate the number of decoupled clusters is designed, which enhances the robustness against channel estimation error. Fourthly, environment-generalizable neural network for CSI feedback (EG-CsiNet) is proposed as a novel learning framework with physics-based distribution alignment. Based on extensive simulations and sim-to-real experiments in various conditions, the proposed EG-CsiNet can robustly reduce the generalization error by more than 3 dB compared to the state-of-the-arts.

Title: Optimal Scheduling of Electricity and Water in Renewable-Colocated Desalination Plants
Authors: Ahmed S. Alahmed, Audun Botterud, Saurabh Amin, Ali T. Al-Awami
Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework for the optimal scheduling of flexible water desalination plants (WDPs) as hybrid generator-load resources. WDPs integrate thermal generation, membrane-based controllable loads, and renewable energy sources, offering unique operational flexibility for power system operations. They can simultaneously participate in two markets: selling desalinated water to a water utility, and bidirectionally transacting electricity with the grid based on their net electricity demand. We formulate the scheduling decision problem of a profit-maximizing WDP, capturing operational, technological, and market-based coupling between water and electricity flows. The threshold-based structure we derive provides computationally tractable coordination suitable for large-scale deployment, offering operational insights into how thermal generation and membrane-based loads complementarily provide continuous bidirectional flexibility. The thresholds are analytically characterized in closed form as explicit functions of technology and tariff parameters. We examine how small changes in the exogenous tariff and technology parameters affect the WDP's profit. Extensive simulations illustrate the optimal WDP's operation, profit, and water-electricity exchange, demonstrating significant improvements relative to benchmark algorithms.

Title: Multi-mode Fault Diagnosis Datasets of Three-phase Asynchronous Motor Under Variable Working Conditions
Authors: Shijin Chen, Zeyi Liu, Chenyang Li, Dongliang Zou, Xiao He, Donghua Zhou
Abstract: Three-phase asynchronous motor are fundamental components in industrial systems, and their failure can lead to significant operational downtime and economic losses. Vibration and current signals are effective indicators for monitoring motor health and diagnosing faults. However, motors in real applications often operate under variable conditions such as fluctuating speeds and loads, which complicate the fault diagnosis process. This paper presents a comprehensive dataset collected from a three-phase asynchronous motor under various fault types and severities, operating under diverse speed and load conditions. The dataset includes both single faults and mechanical-electrical compound faults, such as rotor unbalance, stator winding short circuits, bearing faults, and their combinations. Data were acquired under both steady and transitional conditions, with signals including triaxial vibration, three-phase currents, torque, and key-phase signals. This dataset supports the development and validation of robust fault diagnosis methods for electric motors under realistic operating conditions.

Title: A Mathematical Formalization of Self-Determining Agency
Authors: Yoshiyuki Ohmura, Earnest Kota Carr, Yasuo Kuniyoshi
Abstract: Defining agency is an extremely important challenge for cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Physics generally describes mechanical happenings, but there remains an unbridgeable gap between these and the acts of agents. To discuss the morality and responsibility of agents, it is necessary to model acts; whether such responsible acts can be fully explained by physical determinism remains an ongoing debate. Although we have already proposed a physical agent determinism model that appears to go beyond mere mechanical happenings, we have not yet established a strict mathematical formalism to eliminate ambiguity. Here, we explain why a physical system can follow coarse-graining agent-level determination without violating physical laws by formulating supervenient causation. Generally, supervenience including coarse graining does not change without a change in its lower base; therefore, a single supervenience alone cannot define supervenient causation. We define supervenient causation as the causal efficacy from the supervenience level to its lower base level. Although an algebraic expression composed of the multiple supervenient functions does supervenes on the base, an index sequence that determines the algebraic expression does not supervene on the base. Therefore, the sequence can possess unique dynamical laws that are independent of the lower base level. This independent dynamics creates the possibility for temporally preceding changes at the supervenience level to cause changes at the lower base level. Such a dual-laws system is considered useful for modeling self-determining agents such as humans.

Title: Distributed Uplink Anti-Jamming in LEO Mega-Constellations via Game-Theoretic Beamforming
Authors: Shizhen Jia, Mingjun Ying, Marco Mezzavilla, Theodore S. Rappaport, Sundeep Rangan
Abstract: Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations have become vital in emerging commercial and defense Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs). However, their predictable orbital dynamics and exposed geometries make them highly susceptible to ground-based jamming. Traditional single-satellite interference mitigation techniques struggle to spatially separate desired uplink signals from nearby jammers, even with large antenna arrays. This paper explores a distributed multi-satellite anti-jamming strategy leveraging the dense connectivity and high-speed inter-satellite links of modern LEO mega-constellations. We model the uplink interference scenario as a convex-concave game between a desired terrestrial transmitter and a jammer, each optimizing their spatial covariance matrices to maximize or minimize achievable rate. We propose an efficient min-max solver combining alternating best-response updates with projected gradient descent, achieving fast convergence of the beamforming strategy to the Nash equilibrium. Using realistic Starlink orbital geometries and Sionna ray-tracing simulations, we demonstrate that while close-proximity jammers can cripple single-satellite links, distributed satellite cooperation significantly enhances resilience, shifting the capacity distribution upward under strong interference.

Title: EchoJEPA: A Latent Predictive Foundation Model for Echocardiography
Authors: Alif Munim, Adibvafa Fallahpour, Teodora Szasz, Ahmadreza Attarpour, River Jiang, Brana Sooriyakanthan, Maala Sooriyakanthan, Heather Whitney, Jeremy Slivnick, Barry Rubin, Wendy Tsang, Bo Wang
Abstract: Foundation models for echocardiography often struggle to disentangle anatomical signal from the stochastic speckle and acquisition artifacts inherent to ultrasound. We present EchoJEPA, a foundation model trained on 18 million echocardiograms across 300K patients, representing the largest pretraining corpus for this modality to date. By leveraging a latent predictive objective, EchoJEPA learns robust anatomical representations that ignore speckle noise. We validate this using a novel multi-view probing framework with frozen backbones, where EchoJEPA outperforms leading baselines by approximately 20% in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) estimation and 17% in right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) estimation. The model also exhibits remarkable sample efficiency, reaching 79% view classification accuracy with only 1% of labeled data versus 42% for the best baseline trained on 100%. Crucially, EchoJEPA demonstrates superior generalization, degrading by only 2% under physics-informed acoustic perturbations compared to 17% for competitors. Most remarkably, its zero-shot performance on pediatric patients surpasses fully fine-tuned baselines, establishing latent prediction as a superior paradigm for robust, generalizable medical AI.

Title: ProOPF: Benchmarking and Improving LLMs for Professional-Grade Power Systems Optimization Modeling
Authors: Chao Shen, Zihan Guo, Xu Wan, Zhenghao Yang, Yifan Zhang, Wengi Huang, Jie Song, Zongyan Zhang, Mingyang Sun
Abstract: Growing renewable penetration introduces substantial uncertainty into power system operations, necessitating frequent adaptation of dispatch objectives and constraints and challenging expertise-intensive, near-real-time modeling workflows. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising avenue for automating this process by translating natural-language (NL) operational requirements into executable optimization models via semantic reasoning and code synthesis. Yet existing LLM datasets and benchmarks for optimization modeling primarily target coarse-grained cross-domain generalization, offering limited, rigorous evaluation in power-system settings, particularly for Optimal Power Flow (OPF). We therefore introduce \textbf{ProOPF-D} and \textbf{ProOPF-B}, a dataset and benchmark for professional-grade OPF modeling: ProOPF-D contains 12K instances pairing NL requests with parameter adjustments and structural extensions to a canonical OPF, together with executable implementations; ProOPF-B provides 121 expert-annotated test cases with ground-truth code, enabling end-to-end evaluation under both concrete and abstract OPF modeling regimes.

Title: Benchmarking Automatic Speech Recognition for Indian Languages in Agricultural Contexts
Authors: Chandrashekar M S, Vineet Singh, Lakshmi Pedapudi
Abstract: The digitization of agricultural advisory services in India requires robust Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems capable of accurately transcribing domain-specific terminology in multiple Indian languages. This paper presents a benchmarking framework for evaluating ASR performance in agricultural contexts across Hindi, Telugu, and Odia languages. We introduce evaluation metrics including Agriculture Weighted Word Error Rate (AWWER) and domain-specific utility scoring to complement traditional metrics. Our evaluation of 10,934 audio recordings, each transcribed by up to 10 ASR models, reveals performance variations across languages and models, with Hindi achieving the best overall performance (WER: 16.2%) while Odia presents the greatest challenges (best WER: 35.1%, achieved only with speaker diarization). We characterize audio quality challenges inherent to real-world agricultural field recordings and demonstrate that speaker diarization with best-speaker selection can substantially reduce WER for multi-speaker recordings (upto 66% depending on the proportion of multi-speaker audio). We identify recurring error patterns in agricultural terminology and provide practical recommendations for improving ASR systems in low-resource agricultural domains. The study establishes baseline benchmarks for future agricultural ASR development.

Title: Nonparametric Evaluation of Noisy ICA Solutions
Authors: Syamantak Kumar, Purnamrita Sarkar, Peter Bickel, Derek Bean
Abstract: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was introduced in the 1980's as a model for Blind Source Separation (BSS), which refers to the process of recovering the sources underlying a mixture of signals, with little knowledge about the source signals or the mixing process. While there are many sophisticated algorithms for estimation, different methods have different shortcomings. In this paper, we develop a nonparametric score to adaptively pick the right algorithm for ICA with arbitrary Gaussian noise. The novelty of this score stems from the fact that it just assumes a finite second moment of the data and uses the characteristic function to evaluate the quality of the estimated mixing matrix without any knowledge of the parameters of the noise distribution. In addition, we propose some new contrast functions and algorithms that enjoy the same fast computability as existing algorithms like FASTICA and JADE but work in domains where the former may fail. While these also may have weaknesses, our proposed diagnostic, as shown by our simulations, can remedy them. Finally, we propose a theoretical framework to analyze the local and global convergence properties of our algorithms.

Title: Towards Scalable Multi-Chip Wireless Networks with Near-Field Time Reversal
Authors: Ama Bandara, Fátima Rodríguez-Galán, Pau Talarn, Elana Pereira de Santana, Evgenii Vinogradov, Peter Haring Bolívar, Eduard Alarcón, Sergi Abadal
Abstract: The concept of Wireless Network-on-Chip (WNoC) has emerged as a potential solution to address the escalating communication demands of modern computing systems due to its low-latency, versatility, and reconfigurability. However, for WNoC to fulfill its potential, it is essential to establish multiple high-speed wireless links across chips. Unfortunately, the compact and enclosed nature of computing packages introduces significant challenges in the form of Co-Channel Interference (CCI) and Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI), which not only hinder the deployment of multiple spatial channels, but also severely restrict the symbol rate of each individual channel. In this paper, we posit that Time Reversal (TR) could be effective in addressing both impairments in this static scenario, thanks to its spatiotemporal focusing capabilities even in the near-field. Through comprehensive full-wave simulations and bit error rate analysis in multiple chip layouts with multiple frequency bands, we provide evidence that TR can increase the symbol rate by an order of magnitude, enabling the deployment of multiple concurrent links and achieving aggregate speeds exceeding 100 Gb/s. Finally, we evaluate the impact of reducing the sampling rate of the TR filter on the achievable speeds, paving the way to practical TR-based wireless communications at the chip scale.

Title: Stochastic LQR Design With Disturbance Preview
Authors: Jietian Liu, Laurent Lessard, Peter Seiler
Abstract: This paper considers the discrete-time, stochastic LQR problem with $p$ steps of disturbance preview information where $p$ is finite. We first derive the solution for this problem on a finite horizon with linear, time-varying dynamics and time-varying costs. Next, we derive the solution on the infinite horizon with linear, time-invariant dynamics and time-invariant costs. Our proofs rely on the well-known principle of optimality. We provide an independent proof for the principle of optimality that relies only on nested information structure. Finally, we show that the finite preview controller converges to the optimal noncausal controller as the preview horizon $p$ tends to infinity. We also provide a simple example to illustrate both the finite and infinite horizon results.

Title: From a Frequency-Domain Willems' Lemma to Data-Driven Predictive Control
Authors: T.J. Meijer, K.J.A. Scheres, S.A.N. Nouwens, V.S. Dolk, W.P.M.H. Heemels
Abstract: Willems' fundamental lemma has recently received an impressive amount of attention from the data-driven control community. In this paper, we formulate a version of this celebrated result based on frequency-domain data. In doing so, we bridge the gap between recent developments in data-driven control, and the readily-available techniques and expertise for non-parametric frequency-domain identification. We also generalize our results to combine multiple frequency-domain data sets to form a sufficiently rich data set. Building on these results, we propose a data-driven predictive control scheme based on measured frequency-domain data of the plant. This novel scheme provides a frequency-domain counterpart of the well-known data-enabled predictive control scheme DeePC based on time-domain data. Under appropriate conditions, the new frequency-domain data-driven predictive control (FreePC) scheme is equivalent to the corresponding DeePC scheme. We demonstrate the benefits of FreePC and the use of frequency-domain data in several examples and a numerical case study, including the ability to collect data in closed loop, computational benefits, and intuitive visualization of the data.

Title: Tokenizing Single-Channel EEG with Time-Frequency Motif Learning
Authors: Jathurshan Pradeepkumar, Xihao Piao, Zheng Chen, Jimeng Sun
Abstract: Foundation models are reshaping EEG analysis, yet an important problem of EEG tokenization remains a challenge. This paper presents TFM-Tokenizer, a novel tokenization framework that learns a vocabulary of time-frequency motifs from single-channel EEG signals and encodes them into discrete tokens. We propose a dual-path architecture with time-frequency masking to capture robust motif representations, and it is model-agnostic, supporting both lightweight transformers and existing foundation models for downstream tasks. Our study demonstrates three key benefits: Accuracy: Experiments on four diverse EEG benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains across both single- and multi-dataset pretraining settings, achieving up to $11\%$ improvement in Cohen's Kappa over strong baselines. Generalization: Moreover, as a plug-and-play component, it consistently boosts the performance of diverse foundation models, including BIOT and LaBraM. Scalability: By operating at the single-channel level rather than relying on the strict 10-20 EEG system, our method has the potential to be device-agnostic. Experiments on ear-EEG sleep staging, which differs from the pretraining data in signal format, channel configuration, recording device, and task, show that our tokenizer outperforms baselines by $14\%$. A comprehensive token analysis reveals strong class-discriminative, frequency-aware, and consistent structure, enabling improved representation quality and interpretability.

Title: Generative Diffusion Model Driven Massive Random Access in Massive MIMO Systems
Authors: Keke Ying, Zhen Gao, Sheng Chen, Tony Q.S. Quek, H. Vincent Poor
Abstract: Massive random access is an important technology for achieving ultra-massive connectivity in next-generation wireless communication systems. It aims to address key challenges during the initial access phase, including active user detection (AUD), channel estimation (CE), and data detection (DD). This paper examines massive access in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where deep learning is used to tackle the challenging AUD, CE, and DD functions. First, we introduce a Transformer-AUD scheme tailored for variable pilot-length access. This approach integrates pilot length information and a spatial correlation module into a Transformer-based detector, enabling a single model to generalize across various pilot lengths and antenna numbers. Next, we propose a generative diffusion model (GDM)-driven iterative CE and DD framework. The GDM employs a score function to capture the posterior distributions of massive MIMO channels and data symbols. Part of the score function is learned from the channel dataset via neural networks, while the remaining score component is derived in a closed form by applying the symbol prior constellation distribution and known transmission model. Utilizing these posterior scores, we design an asynchronous alternating CE and DD framework that employs a predictor-corrector sampling technique to iteratively generate channel estimation and data detection results during the reverse diffusion process. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approaches significantly outperform baseline methods with respect to AUD, CE, and DD.

Title: REACT: Real-time Entanglement-Aware Coverage Path Planning for Tethered Underwater Vehicles
Authors: Abdelhakim Amer, Mohit Mehindratta, Yury Brodskiy, Bilal Wehbe, Erdal Kayacan
Abstract: Inspection of underwater structures with tethered underwater vehicles is often hindered by the risk of tether entanglement. We propose REACT (real-time entanglement-aware coverage path planning for tethered underwater vehicles), a framework designed to overcome this limitation. REACT comprises a computationally efficient geometry-based tether model using the signed distance field (SDF) map for accurate, real-time simulation of taut tether configurations around arbitrary structures in 3D. This model enables an efficient online replanning strategy by enforcing a maximum tether length constraint, thereby actively preventing entanglement. By integrating REACT into a coverage path planning framework, we achieve safe and entanglement-free inspection paths, previously challenging due to tether constraints. The complete REACT framework's efficacy is validated in a pipe inspection scenario, demonstrating safe navigation and full coverage inspection. Simulation results show that REACT achieves complete coverage while maintaining tether constraints and completing the total mission 20% faster than conventional planners, despite a longer inspection time due to proactive avoidance of entanglement that eliminates extensive post-mission disentanglement. Real-world experiments confirm these benefits, where REACT completes the full mission, while the baseline planner fails due to physical tether entanglement.

Title: Pascal-Weighted Genetic Algorithms: A Binomially-Structured Recombination Framework
Authors: Otman A. Basir
Abstract: This paper introduces a new family of multi-parent recombination operators for Genetic Algorithms (GAs), based on normalized Pascal (binomial) coefficients. Unlike classical two-parent crossover operators, Pascal-Weighted Recombination (PWR) forms offsprings as structured convex combination of multiple parents, using binomially shaped weights that emphasize central inheritance while suppressing disruptive variance. We develop a mathematical framework for PWR, derive variance-transfer properties, and analyze its effect on schema survival. The operator is extended to real-valued, binary/logit, and permutation representations. We evaluate the proposed method on four representative benchmarks: (i) PID controller tuning evaluated using the ITAE metric, (ii) FIR low-pass filter design under magnitude-response constraints, (iii) wireless power-modulation optimization under SINR coupling, and (iv) the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). We demonstrate how, across these benchmarks, PWR consistently yields smoother convergence, reduced variance, and achieves 9-22% performance gains over standard recombination operators. The approach is simple, algorithm-agnostic, and readily integrable into diverse GA architectures.

Title: Experimental Sensitivity Enhancement of a Quantum Rydberg Atom-Based RF Receiver with a Metamaterial GRIN Lens
Authors: Anton Tishchenko, Demos Serghiou, Ashwin Thelappilly Joy, Paul Marsh, Paul Martin, Tim Brown, Gabriele Gradoni, Mohsen Khalily, Rahim Tafazolli
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate enhanced sensitivity of an atom-based Rydberg radio frequency (RF) receiver integrated with a gradient refractive index (GRIN) Luneburg-type metamaterial lens. By analyzing the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) effect in Cesium vapor, we compare receiver performance with and without the GRIN lens under a 2.2~GHz and a 3.6~GHz far-field excitation. Our measurements reveal a significant amplification of the EIT window when the lens is introduced, consistent with the theoretical prediction that the local E-field enhancement at the vapor cell reduces the minimum detectable electric field and improves the microwave electric field measurement sensitivity of the Rydberg atom-based RF receiver over an ultrawide bandwidth of the lens. This experimental validation demonstrates the potential of metamaterial-enhanced quantum RF sensing for a wide range of applications, such as electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing, quantum radar, and wireless communication.

Title: Multi-Sensor Attention Networks for Automated Subsurface Delamination Detection in Concrete Bridge Decks
Authors: Alireza Moayedikia, Amirhossein Moayedikia
Abstract: Subsurface delaminations in concrete bridge decks remain undetectable through conventional visual inspection, necessitating automated non-destructive evaluation methods. This work introduces a deep learning framework that integrates Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and Infrared Thermography (IRT) through hierarchical attention mechanisms. Our architecture employs temporal self-attention to process GPR electromagnetic signals, spatial attention to analyze thermal imagery, and cross-modal attention with learnable embeddings to model inter-sensor correspondences. We integrate Monte Carlo dropout-based uncertainty quantification, decomposing prediction confidence into model uncertainty and data-driven uncertainty components. Testing across five real-world bridge datasets from the SDNET2021 benchmark reveals that our approach delivers substantial performance gains over single-sensor and concatenation-based baselines when applied to balanced or moderately imbalanced data distributions. Comprehensive ablation analysis confirms that cross-modal attention mechanisms contribute meaningful improvements beyond unimodal attention alone. Critically, we identify and characterize specific failure modes: under extreme class imbalance, attention-based architectures demonstrate susceptibility to majority class bias, indicating scenarios where simpler architectural choices may prove more robust. Our findings equip practitioners with empirically-grounded criteria for selecting appropriate fusion strategies based on dataset characteristics, rather than promoting universal architectural superiority.

Title: Collective Noise Filtering in Complex Networks
Authors: Tingyu Zhao, István A. Kovács
Abstract: Complex networks are powerful representations of complex systems across scales and domains, and the field is experiencing unprecedented growth in data availability. However, real-world network data often suffer from noise, biases, and missing data in edge weights, which undermine the reliability of downstream network analyses. Standard noise filtering approaches, whether treating individual edges one-by-one or assuming a uniform global noise level, are suboptimal, because in reality both signal and noise can be heterogeneous and correlated across multiple edges. As a solution, we introduce the Network Wiener Filter, a principled method for collective edge-level noise filtering that leverages both network structure and noise characteristics, to reduce error in the observed edge weights and to infer missing edge weights. We demonstrate the broad practical efficacy of the Network Wiener Filter in two distinct settings, the genetic interaction network of the budding yeast S. cerevisiae and the Enron Corpus email network, noting compelling evidence of successful noise suppression in both applications. With the Network Wiener Filter, we advocate for a shift toward error-aware network science, one that embraces data imperfection as an inherent feature and learns to navigate it effectively.

Title: Regret of $H_\infty$ Preview Controllers
Authors: Jietian Liu, Peter Seiler
Abstract: This paper studies preview control in both the $H_\infty$ and regret-optimal settings. The plant is modeled as a discrete-time, linear time-invariant system subject to external disturbances. The performance baseline is the optimal non-causal controller that has full knowledge of the disturbance sequence. We first review the construction of the $H_\infty$ preview controller with $p$-steps of disturbance preview. We then show that the closed-loop $H_\infty$ performance of this preview controller converges as $p\to \infty$ to the performance of the optimal non-causal controller. Furthermore, we prove that the optimal regret of the preview controller converges to zero. These results demonstrate that increasing preview length allows controllers to asymptotically achieve non-causal performance in both the $H_\infty$ and regret frameworks. A numerical example illustrates the theoretical results.
