Title: Pronunciation-Lexicon Free Training for Phoneme-based Crosslingual ASR via Joint Stochastic Approximation
Authors: Saierdaer Yusuyin, Te Ma, Hao Huang, Zhijian Ou
Abstract: Recently, pre-trained models with phonetic supervision have demonstrated their advantages for crosslingual speech recognition in data efficiency and information sharing across languages. However, a limitation is that a pronunciation lexicon is needed for such phoneme-based crosslingual speech recognition. In this study, we aim to eliminate the need for pronunciation lexicons and propose a latent variable model based method, with phonemes being treated as discrete latent variables. The new method consists of a speech-to-phoneme (S2P) model and a phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G) model, and a grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) model is introduced as an auxiliary inference model. To jointly train the three models, we utilize the joint stochastic approximation (JSA) algorithm, which is a stochastic extension of the EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm and has demonstrated superior performance particularly in estimating discrete latent variable models. Based on the Whistle multilingual pre-trained S2P model, crosslingual experiments are conducted in Polish (130 h) and Indonesian (20 h). With only 10 minutes of phoneme supervision, the new method, JSA-SPG, achieves 5\% error rate reductions compared to the best crosslingual fine-tuning approach using subword or full phoneme supervision. Furthermore, it is found that in language domain adaptation (i.e., utilizing cross-domain text-only data), JSA-SPG outperforms the standard practice of language model fusion via the auxiliary support of the G2P model by 9% error rate reductions. To facilitate reproducibility and encourage further exploration in this field, we open-source the JSA-SPG training code and complete pipeline.

Title: X-ray transferable polyrepresentation learning
Authors: Weronika Hryniewska-Guzik, Przemyslaw Biecek
Abstract: The success of machine learning algorithms is inherently related to the extraction of meaningful features, as they play a pivotal role in the performance of these algorithms. Central to this challenge is the quality of data representation. However, the ability to generalize and extract these features effectively from unseen datasets is also crucial. In light of this, we introduce a novel concept: the polyrepresentation. Polyrepresentation integrates multiple representations of the same modality extracted from distinct sources, for example, vector embeddings from the Siamese Network, self-supervised models, and interpretable radiomic features. This approach yields better performance metrics compared to relying on a single representation. Additionally, in the context of X-ray images, we demonstrate the transferability of the created polyrepresentation to a smaller dataset, underscoring its potential as a pragmatic and resource-efficient approach in various image-related solutions. It is worth noting that the concept of polyprepresentation on the example of medical data can also be applied to other domains, showcasing its versatility and broad potential impact.

Title: Optimization of Fractal Image Compression
Authors: Nastaran Pourshab
Abstract: Fractal Image Compression (FIC) is a lossy image compression technique that leverages self-similarity within an image to achieve high compression ratios. However, the process of compressing the image is computationally expensive. This paper investigates optimization techniques to improve the efficiency of FIC, focusing on increasing compression ratio and reducing computational time. The paper explores a novel approach named the Box Counting Method for estimating fractal dimensions, which is very simple to integrate into FIC compared to other algorithms. The results show that implementing these optimization techniques enhances both the compression ratio and the compression time.

Title: Revisiting Chien-Hrones-Reswick Method for an Analytical Solution
Authors: Senol Gulgonul
Abstract: This study presents an analytical method for tuning PI controllers in First-Order with Time Delay (FOTD) systems, leveraging the Lambert W function. The Lambert W function enables exact pole placement, yielding analytical expressions for PI gains. The proposed approach identifies a critical condition that achieves a step response without overshoot with minimum settling time, while also providing explicit tuning rules for systems where controlled overshoot is specified. The method demonstrates strong agreement with established empirical Chien-Hrones-Reswick tuning rules for both non-overshooting and overshooting cases, bridging the gap between theoretical analysis and empirical results.

Title: Mamba Goes HoME: Hierarchical Soft Mixture-of-Experts for 3D Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Szymon Płotka, Maciej Chrabaszcz, Gizem Mert, Ewa Szczurek, Arkadiusz Sitek
Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence has significantly advanced medical image segmentation. However, challenges remain, including efficient 3D medical image processing across diverse modalities and handling data variability. In this work, we introduce Hierarchical Soft Mixture-of-Experts (HoME), a two-level token-routing layer for efficient long-context modeling, specifically designed for 3D medical image segmentation. Built on the Mamba state-space model (SSM) backbone, HoME enhances sequential modeling through sparse, adaptive expert routing. The first stage employs a Soft Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) layer to partition input sequences into local groups, routing tokens to specialized per-group experts for localized feature extraction. The second stage aggregates these outputs via a global SMoE layer, enabling cross-group information fusion and global context refinement. This hierarchical design, combining local expert routing with global expert refinement improves generalizability and segmentation performance, surpassing state-of-the-art results across datasets from the three most commonly used 3D medical imaging modalities and data quality.

Title: Forex Trading Robot Using Fuzzy Logic
Authors: Mustafa Shabani, Alireza Nasiri, Hassan Nafardi
Abstract: In this study, we propose a fuzzy system for conducting short-term transactions in the forex market. The system is designed to enhance common strategies in the forex market using fuzzy logic, thereby improving the accuracy of transactions. Traditionally, technical strategies based on oscillator indicators have relied on predefined ranges for indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Commodity Channel Indicator (CCI), and Stochastic to determine entry points for trades. However, the use of these classic indicators has yielded suboptimal results due to the changing nature of the market over time. In our proposed approach, instead of employing classical indicators, we introduce a fuzzy Mamdani system for each indicator. The results obtained from these systems are then combined through voting to design a trading robot. Our findings demonstrate a considerable increase in the profitability factor compared to three other methods. Additionally, net profit, gross profit, and maximum capital reduction are calculated and compared across all approaches.

Title: Mitigating Multi-Sequence 3D Prostate MRI Data Scarcity through Domain Adaptation using Locally-Trained Latent Diffusion Models for Prostate Cancer Detection
Authors: Emerson P. Grabke, Babak Taati, Masoom A. Haider
Abstract: Objective: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) could mitigate data scarcity challenges affecting machine learning development for medical image interpretation. The recent CCELLA LDM improved prostate cancer detection performance using synthetic MRI for classifier training but was limited to the axial T2-weighted (AxT2) sequence, did not investigate inter-institutional domain shift, and prioritized radiology over histopathology outcomes. We propose CCELLA++ to address these limitations and improve clinical utility. Methods: CCELLA++ expands CCELLA for simultaneous biparametric prostate MRI (bpMRI) generation, including the AxT2, high b-value diffusion series (HighB) and apparent diffusion coefficient map (ADC). Domain adaptation was investigated by pretraining classifiers on real or LDM-generated synthetic data from an internal institution, followed with fine-tuning on progressively smaller fractions of an out-of-distribution, external dataset. Results: CCELLA++ improved 3D FID for HighB and ADC but not AxT2 (0.013, 0.012, 0.063 respectively) sequences compared to CCELLA (0.060). Classifier pretraining with CCELLA++ bpMRI outperformed real bpMRI in AP and AUC for all domain adaptation scenarios. CCELLA++ pretraining achieved highest classifier performance below 50% (n=665) external dataset volume. Conclusion: Synthetic bpMRI generated by our method can improve downstream classifier generalization and performance beyond real bpMRI or CCELLA-generated AxT2-only images. Future work should seek to quantify medical image sample quality, balance multi-sequence LDM training, and condition the LDM with additional information. Significance: The proposed CCELLA++ LDM can generate synthetic bpMRI that outperforms real data for domain adaptation with a limited target institution dataset.

Title: How Complex is a Complex Network? Insights from Linear Systems Theory
Authors: Giacomo Baggio, Marco Fabris
Abstract: This paper leverages linear systems theory to propose a principled measure of complexity for network systems. We focus on a network of first-order scalar linear systems interconnected through a directed graph. By locally filtering out the effect of nodal dynamics in the interconnected system, we propose a new quantitative index of network complexity rooted in the notion of McMillan degree of a linear system. First, we show that network systems with the same interconnection structure share the same complexity index for almost all choices of their interconnection weights. Then, we investigate the dependence of the proposed index on the topology of the network and the pattern of heterogeneity of the nodal dynamics. Specifically, we find that the index depends on the matching number of subgraphs identified by nodal dynamics of different nature, highlighting the joint impact of network architecture and component diversity on overall system complexity.

Title: VoI-aware Scheduling Schemes for Multi-Agent Formation Control
Authors: Federico Chiariotti, Marco Fabris
Abstract: Formation control allows agents to maintain geometric patterns using local information, but most existing methods assume ideal communication. This paper introduces a goal-oriented framework combining control, cooperative positioning, and communication scheduling for first-order formation tracking. Each agent estimates its position using 6G network-based triangulation, and the scheduling of information updates is governed by Age of Information (AoI) and Value of Information (VoI) metrics. We design three lightweight, signaling-free scheduling policies and assess their impact on formation quality. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in maintaining accurate formations with no additional communication overhead, showing that worst-case formation adherence increases by 20%.

Authors: Doyeong Lim, Yang Liu, Zavier Ndum Ndum, Christian Young, Yassin Hassan
Abstract: This paper presents a multipurpose artificial intelligence (AI)-driven thermal-fluid testbed designed to advance Small Modular Reactor technologies by seamlessly integrating physical experimentation with advanced computational intelligence. The platform uniquely combines a versatile three-loop thermal-fluid facility with a high-fidelity digital twin and sophisticated AI frameworks for real-time prediction, control, and operational assistance. Methodologically, the testbed's digital twin, built upon the System Analysis Module code, is coupled with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network. This machine learning model, trained on experimental data, enables faster-than-real-time simulation, providing predictive insights into the system's dynamic behavior. The practical application of this AI integration is showcased through case studies. An AI-driven control framework where the GRU model accurately forecasts future system states and the corresponding control actions required to meet operational demands. Furthermore, an intelligent assistant, powered by a large language model, translates complex sensor data and simulation outputs into natural language, offering operators actionable analysis and safety recommendations. Comprehensive validation against experimental transients confirms the platform's high fidelity, with the GRU model achieving a temperature prediction root mean square error of 1.42 K. This work establishes an integrated research environment at the intersection of AI and thermal-fluid science, showcasing how AI-driven methodologies in modeling, control, and operator support can accelerate the innovation and deployment of next-generation nuclear systems.

Title: Attention-Enhanced Deep Learning Ensemble for Breast Density Classification in Mammography
Authors: Peyman Sharifian, Xiaotong Hong, Alireza Karimian, Mehdi Amini, Hossein Arabi
Abstract: Breast density assessment is a crucial component of mammographic interpretation, with high breast density (BI-RADS categories C and D) representing both a significant risk factor for developing breast cancer and a technical challenge for tumor detection. This study proposes an automated deep learning system for robust binary classification of breast density (low: A/B vs. high: C/D) using the VinDr-Mammo dataset. We implemented and compared four advanced convolutional neural networks: ResNet18, ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0, and DenseNet121, each enhanced with channel attention mechanisms. To address the inherent class imbalance, we developed a novel Combined Focal Label Smoothing Loss function that integrates focal loss, label smoothing, and class-balanced weighting. Our preprocessing pipeline incorporated advanced techniques, including contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) and comprehensive data augmentation. The individual models were combined through an optimized ensemble voting approach, achieving superior performance (AUC: 0.963, F1-score: 0.952) compared to any single model. This system demonstrates significant potential to standardize density assessments in clinical practice, potentially improving screening efficiency and early cancer detection rates while reducing inter-observer variability among radiologists.

Title: Voltage Regulation in Distribution Systems with Data Center Loads
Authors: Yize Chen, Baosen Zhang
Abstract: Recent boom in foundation models and AI computing have raised growing concerns on the power and energy trajectories of large-scale data centers. This paper focuses on the voltage issues caused by volatile and intensity of data center power demand, which also aligns with recent observations of more frequent voltage disturbances in power grids. To address these data center integration challenges, we propose a dynamic voltage control scheme by harnessing data center's load regulation capabilities. By taking local voltage measurements and adjusting power injections at each data center buses through the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) scheme, we are able to maintain safe voltage magnitude in a distributed fashion with higher data center computing load. Simulations using real large language model (LLM) inference load validate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism. Both the LLM power data and proposed control scheme are open sourced.

Title: Capsule-ConvKAN: A Hybrid Neural Approach to Medical Image Classification
Authors: Laura Pituková, Peter Sinčák, László József Kovács
Abstract: This study conducts a comprehensive comparison of four neural network architectures: Convolutional Neural Network, Capsule Network, Convolutional Kolmogorov--Arnold Network, and the newly proposed Capsule--Convolutional Kolmogorov--Arnold Network. The proposed Capsule-ConvKAN architecture combines the dynamic routing and spatial hierarchy capabilities of Capsule Network with the flexible and interpretable function approximation of Convolutional Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks. This novel hybrid model was developed to improve feature representation and classification accuracy, particularly in challenging real-world biomedical image data. The architectures were evaluated on a histopathological image dataset, where Capsule-ConvKAN achieved the highest classification performance with an accuracy of 91.21\%. The results demonstrate the potential of the newly introduced Capsule-ConvKAN in capturing spatial patterns, managing complex features, and addressing the limitations of traditional convolutional models in medical image classification.

Title: Experience-Centric Resource Management in ISAC Networks: A Digital Agent-Assisted Approach
Authors: Xinyu Huang, Yixiao Zhang, Yingying Pei, Jianzhe Xue, Xuemin Shen
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a digital agent (DA)-assisted resource management scheme for enhanced user quality of experience (QoE) in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks. Particularly, user QoE is a comprehensive metric that integrates quality of service (QoS), user behavioral dynamics, and environmental complexity. The novel DA module includes a user status prediction model, a QoS factor selection model, and a QoE fitting model, which analyzes historical user status data to construct and update user-specific QoE models. Users are clustered into different groups based on their QoE models. A Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) model is utilized to quantify the impact of allocated communication resources on sensing accuracy. A joint optimization problem of communication and computing resource management is formulated to maximize long-term user QoE while satisfying CRB and resource constraints. A two-layer data-model-driven algorithm is developed to solve the formulated problem, where the top layer utilizes an advanced deep reinforcement learning algorithm to make group-level decisions, and the bottom layer uses convex optimization techniques to make user-level decisions. Simulation results based on a real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed DA-assisted resource management scheme outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of user QoE.

Title: VisioPath: Vision-Language Enhanced Model Predictive Control for Safe Autonomous Navigation in Mixed Traffic
Authors: Shanting Wang, Panagiotis Typaldos, Chenjun Li, Andreas A. Malikopoulos
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce VisioPath, a novel framework combining vision-language models (VLMs) with model predictive control (MPC) to enable safe autonomous driving in dynamic traffic environments. The proposed approach leverages a bird's-eye view video processing pipeline and zero-shot VLM capabilities to obtain structured information about surrounding vehicles, including their positions, dimensions, and velocities. Using this rich perception output, we construct elliptical collision-avoidance potential fields around other traffic participants, which are seamlessly integrated into a finite-horizon optimal control problem for trajectory planning. The resulting trajectory optimization is solved via differential dynamic programming with an adaptive regularization scheme and is embedded in an event-triggered MPC loop. To ensure collision-free motion, a safety verification layer is incorporated in the framework that provides an assessment of potential unsafe trajectories. Extensive simulations in Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) demonstrate that VisioPath outperforms conventional MPC baselines across multiple metrics. By combining modern AI-driven perception with the rigorous foundation of optimal control, VisioPath represents a significant step forward in safe trajectory planning for complex traffic systems.

Title: On Regular Regressors in Adaptive Control
Authors: Erick Mejia Uzeda (1), Mireille E. Broucke (1) ((1) University of Toronto)
Abstract: This paper addresses a shortcoming in adaptive control, that the property of a regressor being persistently exciting (PE) is not well-behaved. One can construct regressors that upend the commonsense notion that excitation should not be created out of nothing. To amend the situation, a notion of regularity of regressors is needed. We are naturally led to a broad class of regular regressors that enjoy the property that their excitation is always confined to a subspace, a foundational result called the PE decomposition. A geometric characterization of regressor excitation opens up new avenues for adaptive control, as we demonstrate by formulating a number of new adaptive control problems.

Title: Open-Set Source Tracing of Audio Deepfake Systems
Authors: Nicholas Klein, Hemlata Tak, Elie Khoury
Abstract: Existing research on source tracing of audio deepfake systems has focused primarily on the closed-set scenario, while studies that evaluate open-set performance are limited to a small number of unseen systems. Due to the large number of emerging audio deepfake systems, robust open-set source tracing is critical. We leverage the protocol of the Interspeech 2025 special session on source tracing to evaluate methods for improving open-set source tracing performance. We introduce a novel adaptation to the energy score for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, softmax energy (SME). We find that replacing the typical temperature-scaled energy score with SME provides a relative average improvement of 31% in the standard FPR95 (false positive rate at true positive rate of 95%) measure. We further explore SME-guided training as well as copy synthesis, codec, and reverberation augmentations, yielding an FPR95 of 8.3%.

Title: Dual State-space Fidelity Blade (D-STAB): A Novel Stealthy Cyber-physical Attack Paradigm
Authors: Jiajun Shen, Hao Tu, Fengjun Li, Morteza Hashemi, Di Wu, Huazhen Fang
Abstract: This paper presents a novel cyber-physical attack paradigm, termed the Dual State-Space Fidelity Blade (D-STAB), which targets the firmware of core cyber-physical components as a new class of attack surfaces. The D-STAB attack exploits the information asymmetry caused by the fidelity gap between high-fidelity and low-fidelity physical models in cyber-physical systems. By designing precise adversarial constraints based on high-fidelity state-space information, the attack induces deviations in high-fidelity states that remain undetected by defenders relying on low-fidelity observations. The effectiveness of D-STAB is demonstrated through a case study in cyber-physical battery systems, specifically in an optimal charging task governed by a Battery Management System (BMS).

Title: Training Strategies for Modality Dropout Resilient Multi-Modal Target Speaker Extraction
Authors: Srikanth Korse, Mohamed Elminshawi, Emanuel A. P. Habets, Srikanth Raj Chetupalli
Abstract: The primary goal of multi-modal TSE (MTSE) is to extract a target speaker from a speech mixture using complementary information from different modalities, such as audio enrolment and visual feeds corresponding to the target speaker. MTSE systems are expected to perform well even when one of the modalities is unavailable. In practice, the systems often suffer from modality dominance, where one of the modalities outweighs the others, thereby limiting robustness. Our study investigates training strategies and the effect of architectural choices, particularly the normalization layers, in yielding a robust MTSE system in both non-causal and causal configurations. In particular, we propose the use of modality dropout training (MDT) as a superior strategy to standard and multi-task training (MTT) strategies. Experiments conducted on two-speaker mixtures from the LRS3 dataset show the MDT strategy to be effective irrespective of the employed normalization layer. In contrast, the models trained with the standard and MTT strategies are susceptible to modality dominance, and their performance depends on the chosen normalization layer. Additionally, we demonstrate that the system trained with MDT strategy is robust to using extracted speech as the enrollment signal, highlighting its potential applicability in scenarios where the target speaker is not enrolled.

Title: COS2A: Conversion from Sentinel-2 to AVIRIS Hyperspectral Data Using Interpretable Algorithm With Spectral-Spatial Duality
Authors: Chia-Hsiang Lin, Jui-Ting Chen, Zi-Chao Leng, Jhao-Ting Lin
Abstract: The Sentinel-2 satellite, launched by the European Space Agency (ESA), offers extensive spatial coverage and has become indispensable in a wide range of remote sensing applications. However, it just has 12 spectral bands, making substances/objects identification less effective, not mentioning the varying spatial resolutions (10/20/60 m) across the 12 bands. If such a multi-resolution 12-band image can be computationally converted into a hyperspectral image with uniformly high resolution (i.e., 10 m), it significantly facilitates remote identification tasks. Though there are some spectral super-resolution methods, they did not address the multi-resolution issue on one hand, and, more seriously, they mostly focused on the CAVE-level hyperspectral image reconstruction (involving only 31 visible bands) on the other hand, greatly limiting their applicability in real-world remote sensing scenarios. We ambitiously aim to convert Sentinel-2 data directly into NASA's AVIRIS-level hyperspectral image (encompassing up to 172 visible and near-infrared (NIR) bands, after ignoring those absorption/corruption ones). For the first time, this paper solves this specific super-resolution problem (highly ill-posed), allowing all historical Sentinel-2 data to have their corresponding high-standard AVIRIS counterparts. We achieve so by customizing a novel algorithm that introduces deep unfolding regularization and Q-quadratic-norm regularization into the so-called convex/deep (CODE) small-data learning criterion. Based on the derived spectral-spatial duality, the proposed interpretable COS2A algorithm demonstrates superior spectral super-resolution results across diverse land cover types, as validated through extensive experiments.

Title: Airway Segmentation Network for Enhanced Tubular Feature Extraction
Authors: Qibiao Wu, Yagang Wang, Qian Zhang
Abstract: Manual annotation of airway regions in computed tomography images is a time-consuming and expertise-dependent task. Automatic airway segmentation is therefore a prerequisite for enabling rapid bronchoscopic navigation and the clinical deployment of bronchoscopic robotic systems. Although convolutional neural network methods have gained considerable attention in airway segmentation, the unique tree-like structure of airways poses challenges for conventional and deformable convolutions, which often fail to focus on fine airway structures, leading to missed segments and discontinuities. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel tubular feature extraction network, named TfeNet. TfeNet introduces a novel direction-aware convolution operation that first applies spatial rotation transformations to adjust the sampling positions of linear convolution kernels. The deformed kernels are then represented as line segments or polylines in 3D space. Furthermore, a tubular feature fusion module (TFFM) is designed based on asymmetric convolution and residual connection strategies, enhancing the network's focus on subtle airway structures. Extensive experiments conducted on one public dataset and two datasets used in airway segmentation challenges demonstrate that the proposed TfeNet achieves more accuracy and continuous airway structure predictions compared with existing methods. In particular, TfeNet achieves the highest overall score of 94.95% on the current largest airway segmentation dataset, Airway Tree Modeling(ATM22), and demonstrates advanced performance on the lung fibrosis dataset(AIIB23). The code is available at this https URL.

Title: Deep Learning-based Human Gesture Channel Modeling for Integrated Sensing and Communication Scenarios
Authors: Zhengyu Zhang, Neeraj Varshney, Jelena Senic, Raied Caromi, Samuel Berweger, Camillo Gentile, Enrico M. Vitucci, Ruisi He, Vittorio Degli-Esposti
Abstract: With the development of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) for Sixth-Generation (6G) wireless systems, contactless human recognition has emerged as one of the key application scenarios. Since human gesture motion induces subtle and random variations in wireless multipath propagation, how to accurately model human gesture channels has become a crucial issue for the design and validation of ISAC systems. To this end, this paper proposes a deep learning-based human gesture channel modeling framework for ISAC scenarios, in which the human body is decomposed into multiple body parts, and the mapping between human gestures and their corresponding multipath characteristics is learned from real-world measurements. Specifically, a Poisson neural network is employed to predict the number of Multi-Path Components (MPCs) for each human body part, while Conditional Variational Auto-Encoders (C-VAEs) are reused to generate the scattering points, which are further used to reconstruct continuous channel impulse responses and micro-Doppler signatures. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy and generalization across different gestures and subjects, providing an interpretable approach for data augmentation and the evaluation of gesture-based ISAC systems.

Title: Effects of Net Metering Policies on Distributed Energy Resource Valuation and Operation
Authors: Lane D. Smith, Daniel S. Kirschen
Abstract: Net energy metering has been a successful policy for increasing solar generation installations and reducing the costs of photovoltaic arrays for consumers. However, increased maturity of solar technologies and concerns over cost shifts created by net energy metering have recently caused the policy to change its incentives. What once favored behind-the-meter solar generation now is focused on compensating flexible operation. This paper explores the impacts that different net energy metering policies have on commercial consumers with various distributed energy resources. We show that the newest iteration of net energy metering is less beneficial for consumers with only solar generation and instead favors those that pair energy storage with solar. Though shiftable flexible demand offers consumers the ability to operate flexibly, the export prices offered by the latest net energy metering policy provide limited value to flexible demand.

Title: Graph Learning for Cooperative Cell-Free ISAC Systems: From Optimization to Estimation
Authors: Peng Jiang, Ming Li, Rang Liu, Qian Liu
Abstract: Cell-free integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems have emerged as a promising paradigm for sixth-generation (6G) networks, enabling simultaneous high-rate data transmission and high-precision radar sensing through cooperative distributed access points (APs). Fully exploiting these capabilities requires a unified design that bridges system-level optimization with multi-target parameter estimation. This paper proposes an end-to-end graph learning approach to close this gap, modeling the entire cell-free ISAC network as a heterogeneous graph to jointly design the AP mode selection, user association, precoding, and echo signal processing for multi-target position and velocity estimation. In particular, we propose two novel heterogeneous graph learning frameworks: a dynamic graph learning framework and a lightweight mirror-based graph attention network (mirror-GAT) framework. The dynamic graph learning framework employs structural and temporal attention mechanisms integrated with a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN), enabling superior performance and robustness in cell-free ISAC environments. Conversely, the mirror-GAT framework significantly reduces computational complexity and signaling overhead through a bi-level iterative structure with share adjacency. Simulation results validate that both proposed graph-learning-based frameworks achieve significant improvements in multi-target position and velocity estimation accuracy compared to conventional heuristic and optimization-based designs. Particularly, the mirror-GAT framework demonstrates substantial reductions in computational time and signaling overhead, underscoring its suitability for practical deployments.

Title: The Small Phase Condition is Necessary for Symmetric Systems
Authors: Xiaokan Yang, Wei Chen, Li Qiu
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the small phase condition is both sufficient and necessary to ensure the feedback stability when the interconnected systems are symmetric. Such symmetric systems arise in diverse applications. The key lies in that, for a complex symmetric and semi-sectorial matrix, the transformation matrix in its generalized sectorial decomposition can be taken to be real. Such a result fills the gap of phase based necessary condition for the feedback stability of symmetric systems, and serves as a counterpart of the necessity result for small gain condition. Moreover, we explore the necessity of small phase condition for general asymmetric systems. Some insightful results are presented, which help to clarify the main challenge in the general case.

Title: Photometric Stereo using Gaussian Splatting and inverse rendering
Authors: Matéo Ducastel (GREYC), David Tschumperlé, Yvain Quéau
Abstract: Recent state-of-the-art algorithms in photometric stereo rely on neural networks and operate either through prior learning or inverse rendering optimization. Here, we revisit the problem of calibrated photometric stereo by leveraging recent advances in 3D inverse rendering using the Gaussian Splatting formalism. This allows us to parameterize the 3D scene to be reconstructed and optimize it in a more interpretable manner. Our approach incorporates a simplified model for light representation and demonstrates the potential of the Gaussian Splatting rendering engine for the photometric stereo problem.

Title: Coordinated Fast Frequency Regulation in Dynamic Virtual Power Plants via Disturbance Estimation
Authors: Saif Ahmad, Seifeddine Ben Elghali, Hafiz Ahmed
Abstract: In the context of dynamic virtual power plants (DVPPs), the integration of frequency containment reserve (FCR) and fast frequency control (FFC) enabled via local compensation of power imbalance represents a significant advancement in decentralized frequency regulation. However, they still have to cope with the limited power and energy capacities associated with commonly available storage solutions. This work combines a disturbance estimation based decentralized local control with distributed imbalance compensation in the event of local shortfall. The layered architecture facilitates fast local corrections in power setpoints while enabling coordination between neighbouring DVPP nodes to leverage the aggregated capacity, ensuring scalable and efficient operation suitable for renewable-heavy future grids. The proposed approach is validated on an illustrative 4-bus system with a high percentage of renewables.

Title: QoE Optimization for Semantic Self-Correcting Video Transmission in Multi-UAV Networks
Authors: Xuyang Chen, Chong Huang, Daquan Feng, Lei Luo, Yao Sun, Xiang-Gen Xia
Abstract: Real-time unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) video streaming is essential for time-sensitive applications, including remote surveillance, emergency response, and environmental monitoring. However, it faces challenges such as limited bandwidth, latency fluctuations, and high packet loss. To address these issues, we propose a novel semantic self-correcting video transmission framework with ultra-fine bitrate granularity (SSCV-G). In SSCV-G, video frames are encoded into a compact semantic codebook space, and the transmitter adaptively sends a subset of semantic indices based on bandwidth availability, enabling fine-grained bitrate control for improved bandwidth efficiency. At the receiver, a spatio-temporal vision transformer (ST-ViT) performs multi-frame joint decoding to reconstruct dropped semantic indices by modeling intra- and inter-frame dependencies. To further improve performance under dynamic network conditions, we integrate a multi-user proximal policy optimization (MUPPO) reinforcement learning scheme that jointly optimizes communication resource allocation and semantic bitrate selection to maximize user Quality of Experience (QoE). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SSCV-G significantly outperforms state-of-the-art video codecs in coding efficiency, bandwidth adaptability, and packet loss robustness. Moreover, the proposed MUPPO-based QoE optimization consistently surpasses existing benchmarks.

Title: Techno-economic analysis of decarbonized backup power systems using scenario-based stochastic optimization
Authors: Jonas Schweiger, Ruaridh Macdonald
Abstract: In the context of growing concerns about power disruptions, grid reliability and the need for decarbonization, this study evaluates a broad range of clean backup power systems (BPSs) to replace traditional emergency diesel generators. A scenario-based stochastic optimization framework using actual load profiles and outage probabilities is proposed to assess the most promising options from a pool of 27 technologies. This framework allows a comparison of cost-effectiveness and environmental impact of individual technologies and hybrid BPSs across various scenarios. The results highlight the trade-off between total annual system cost and emissions. Significant emission reductions can be achieved at moderate cost increases but deep decarbonization levels incur higher costs. Primary and secondary batteries are included in optimal clean fuel-based systems across all decarbonization levels, combining cost-effective power delivery and long-term storage benefits. The findings highlight the often-overlooked importance of fuel replacement on both emissions and costs. Among the assessed technologies, ammonia generators and hydrogen fuel cells combined with secondary iron-air batteries emerge as cost-effective solutions for achieving decarbonization goals. To ensure a broad range of applicability, the study outlines the impact of emergency fuel purchases, varying demand patterns and demand response options on the optimal BPS. The research findings are valuable for optimizing the design of clean BPSs to economically meet the needs of many facility types and decarbonization targets.

Title: Fast Equivariant Imaging: Acceleration for Unsupervised Learning via Augmented Lagrangian and Auxiliary PnP Denoisers
Authors: Guixian Xu, Jinglai Li, Junqi Tang
Abstract: We propose Fast Equivariant Imaging (FEI), a novel unsupervised learning framework to efficiently train deep imaging networks without ground-truth data. From the perspective of reformulating the Equivariant Imaging based optimization problem via the method of Lagrange multipliers and utilizing plug-and-play denoisers, this novel unsupervised scheme shows superior efficiency and performance compared to vanilla Equivariant Imaging paradigm. In particular, our PnP-FEI scheme achieves an order-of-magnitude (10x) acceleration over standard EI on training U-Net with CT100 dataset for X-ray CT reconstruction, with improved generalization performance.

Title: Optimisation of Electrolyser Operation: Integrating External Heat
Authors: Matthias Derez, Alexander Hoogsteyn, Erik Delarue
Abstract: Integrating external heat into electrolysers can reduce the electrical power demand for carbon-neutral hydrogen production. Efficient operation requires detailed models that incorporate heat availability and its effect on startup costs. This paper advances existing operational models by endogenously modelling startup costs and direct heat integration, based on a piecewise linear approximation of the electrochemical equations. We analyse the impact of low- and high-temperature heat integration on the efficiency and profitability of hydrogen production for solid oxide and proton exchange membrane electrolysis technologies.

Title: Wireless Energy Transfer Beamforming Optimization for Intelligent Transmitting Surface
Authors: Osmel Martínez Rosabal, Onel Alcaraz López, Victoria Dala Pegorara Souto, Richard Demo Souza, Samuel Montejo-Sánchez, Robert Schober, Hirley Alves
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) wireless energy transfer (WET) is a promising technology for powering the growing ecosystem of Internet of Things (IoT) devices using power beacons (PBs). Recent research focuses on designing efficient PB architectures that can support numerous antennas. In this context, PBs equipped with intelligent surfaces present a promising approach, enabling physically large, reconfigurable arrays. Motivated by these advantages, this work aims to minimize the power consumption of a PB equipped with a passive intelligent transmitting surface (ITS) and a collocated digital beamforming-based feeder to charge multiple single-antenna devices. To model the PB's power consumption accurately, we consider power amplifiers nonlinearities, ITS control power, and feeder-to-ITS air interface losses. The resulting optimization problem is highly nonlinear and nonconvex due to the high-power amplifier (HPA), the received power constraints at the devices, and the unit-modulus constraint imposed by the phase shifter configuration of the ITS. To tackle this issue, we apply successive convex approximation (SCA) to iteratively solve convex subproblems that jointly optimize the digital precoder and phase configuration. Given SCA's sensitivity to initialization, we propose an algorithm that ensures initialization feasibility while balancing convergence speed and solution quality. We compare the proposed ITS-equipped PB's power consumption against benchmark architectures featuring digital and hybrid analog-digital beamforming. Results demonstrate that the proposed architecture efficiently scales with the number of RF chains and ITS elements. We also show that nonuniform ITS power distribution influences beamforming and can shift a device between near- and far-field regions, even with a constant aperture.

Title: Speckle2Self: Self-Supervised Ultrasound Speckle Reduction Without Clean Data
Authors: Xuesong Li, Nassir Navab, Zhongliang Jiang
Abstract: Image denoising is a fundamental task in computer vision, particularly in medical ultrasound (US) imaging, where speckle noise significantly degrades image quality. Although recent advancements in deep neural networks have led to substantial improvements in denoising for natural images, these methods cannot be directly applied to US speckle noise, as it is not purely random. Instead, US speckle arises from complex wave interference within the body microstructure, making it tissue-dependent. This dependency means that obtaining two independent noisy observations of the same scene, as required by pioneering Noise2Noise, is not feasible. Additionally, blind-spot networks also cannot handle US speckle noise due to its high spatial dependency. To address this challenge, we introduce Speckle2Self, a novel self-supervised algorithm for speckle reduction using only single noisy observations. The key insight is that applying a multi-scale perturbation (MSP) operation introduces tissue-dependent variations in the speckle pattern across different scales, while preserving the shared anatomical structure. This enables effective speckle suppression by modeling the clean image as a low-rank signal and isolating the sparse noise component. To demonstrate its effectiveness, Speckle2Self is comprehensively compared with conventional filter-based denoising algorithms and SOTA learning-based methods, using both realistic simulated US images and human carotid US images. Additionally, data from multiple US machines are employed to evaluate model generalization and adaptability to images from unseen domains. \textit{Code and datasets will be released upon acceptance.

Title: Enhancing Environment Generalizability for Deep Learning-Based CSI Feedback
Authors: Haoyu Wang, Shuangfeng Han, Xiaoyun Wang, Zhi Sun
Abstract: Accurate and low-overhead channel state information (CSI) feedback is essential to boost the capacity of frequency division duplex (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Deep learning-based CSI feedback significantly outperforms conventional approaches. Nevertheless, current deep learning-based CSI feedback algorithms exhibit limited generalizability to unseen environments, which obviously increases the deployment cost. In this paper, we first model the distribution shift of CSI across different environments, which is composed of the distribution shift of multipath structure and a single-path. Then, EG-CsiNet is proposed as a novel CSI feedback learning framework to enhance environment-generalizability. Explicitly, EG-CsiNet comprises the modules of multipath decoupling and fine-grained alignment, which can address the distribution shift of multipath structure and a single path. Based on extensive simulations, the proposed EG-CsiNet can robustly enhance the generalizability in unseen environments compared to the state-of-the-art, especially in challenging conditions with a single source environment.

Title: OpenDPDv2: A Unified Learning and Optimization Framework for Neural Network Digital Predistortion
Authors: Yizhuo Wu, Ang Li, Chang Gao
Abstract: Neural network (NN)-based Digital Predistortion (DPD) stands out in improving signal quality in wideband radio frequency (RF) power amplifiers (PAs) employing complex modulation. However, NN DPDs usually rely on a large number of parameters for effective linearization and can significantly contribute to the energy consumption of the digital back-end in RF systems. This paper presents OpenDPDv2, a unified framework for PA modeling, DPD learning, and model optimization to reduce power consumption while maintaining high linearization performance. The optimization techniques feature a novel DPD algorithm, TRes-DeltaGRU, alongside two energy-efficient methods. The top-performing 32-bit floating-point (FP32) TRes-DeltaGRU-DPD model achieves an Adjacent Channel Power Ratio (ACPR) of -59.4 dBc and Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) of -42.1 dBc. By exploiting fixed-point quantization and dynamic temporal sparsity of input signals and hidden neurons, the inference energy of our model can be reduced by 4.5X while still maintaining -50.3 dBc ACPR and -35.2 dB EVM with 56% temporal sparsity. This was evaluated using a TM3.1a 200 MHz bandwidth 256-QAM OFDM signal applied to a 3.5 GHz GaN Doherty RF PA. OpenDPDv2 code, datasets, and documentation are publicly accessible at: this https URL.

Title: A Single-Point Measurement Framework for Robust Cyber-Attack Diagnosis in Smart Microgrids Using Dual Fractional-Order Feature Analysis
Authors: Yifan Wang
Abstract: Cyber-attacks jeopardize the safe operation of smart microgrids. At the same time, existing diagnostic methods either depend on expensive multi-point instrumentation or stringent modelling assumptions that are untenable under single-sensor constraints. This paper proposes a Fractional-Order Memory-Enhanced Attack-Diagnosis Scheme (FO-MADS) that achieves low-latency fault localisation and cyber-attack detection using only one VPQ (Voltage-Power-Reactive-power) sensor. FO-MADS first constructs a dual fractional-order feature library by jointly applying Caputo and Grünwald-Letnikov derivatives, thereby amplifying micro-perturbations and slow drifts in the VPQ signal. A two-stage hierarchical classifier then pinpoints the affected inverter and isolates the faulty IGBT switch, effectively alleviating class imbalance. Robustness is further strengthened through Progressive Memory-Replay Adversarial Training (PMR-AT), whose attack-aware loss is dynamically re-weighted via Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM) to prioritise the most challenging samples. Experiments on a four-inverter microgrid testbed comprising 1 normal and 24 fault classes under four attack scenarios demonstrate diagnostic accuracies of 96.6 % (bias), 94.0 % (noise), 92.8 % (data replacement), and 95.7 % (replay), while sustaining 96.7 % under attack-free conditions. These results establish FO-MADS as a cost-effective and readily deployable solution that markedly enhances the cyber-physical resilience of smart microgrids.

Title: Joint Beamforming and Position Optimization for Fluid STAR-RIS-NOMA Assisted Wireless Communication Systems
Authors: Yu Liu, Qu Luo, Gaojie Chen, Pei Xiao, Ahmed Elzanaty, Mohsen Khalily, Rahim Tafazolli
Abstract: To address the limitations of traditional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) in spatial control capability, this paper introduces the concept of the fluid antenna system (FAS) and proposes a fluid simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (FSTAR-RIS) assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) multi-user communication system. In this system, each FSTAR-RIS element is capable of flexible mobility and can dynamically adjust its position in response to environmental variations, thereby enabling simultaneous service to users in both the transmission and reflection zones. This significantly enhances the system's spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) and service adaptability. To maximize the system's weighted sum-rate, we formulate a non-convex optimization problem that jointly optimizes the base station beamforming, the transmission/reflection coefficients of the FSTAR-RIS, and the element positions. An alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is developed, incorporating successive convex approximation (SCA), semi-definite relaxation (SDR), and majorization-minimization (MM) techniques. In particular, to address the complex channel coupling introduced by the coexistence of direct and FSTAR-RIS paths, the MM framework is employed in the element position optimization subproblem, enabling an efficient iterative solution strategy. Simulation results validate that the proposed system achieves up to a 27% increase in total sum rate compared to traditional STAR-RIS systems and requires approximately 50% fewer RIS elements to attain the same performance, highlighting its effectiveness for cost-efficient large-scale deployment.

Title: Musical Source Separation Bake-Off: Comparing Objective Metrics with Human Perception
Authors: Noah Jaffe, John Ashley Burgoyne
Abstract: Music source separation aims to extract individual sound sources (e.g., vocals, drums, guitar) from a mixed music recording. However, evaluating the quality of separated audio remains challenging, as commonly used metrics like the source-to-distortion ratio (SDR) do not always align with human perception. In this study, we conducted a large-scale listener evaluation on the MUSDB18 test set, collecting approximately 30 ratings per track from seven distinct listener groups. We compared several objective energy-ratio metrics, including legacy measures (BSSEval v4, SI-SDR variants), and embedding-based alternatives (Frechet Audio Distance using CLAP-LAION-music, EnCodec, VGGish, Wave2Vec2, and HuBERT). While SDR remains the best-performing metric for vocal estimates, our results show that the scale-invariant signal-to-artifacts ratio (SI-SAR) better predicts listener ratings for drums and bass stems. Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) computed with the CLAP-LAION-music embedding also performs competitively--achieving Kendall's tau values of 0.25 for drums and 0.19 for bass--matching or surpassing energy-based metrics for those stems. However, none of the embedding-based metrics, including CLAP, correlate positively with human perception for vocal estimates. These findings highlight the need for stem-specific evaluation strategies and suggest that no single metric reliably reflects perceptual quality across all source types. We release our raw listener ratings to support reproducibility and further research.

Title: Precise Representation Model of SAR Saturated Interference: Mechanism and Verification
Authors: Lunhao Duan, Xingyu Lu, Yushuang Liu, Jianchao Yang, Hong Gu
Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is highly susceptible to Radio Frequency Interference (RFI). Due to the performance limitations of components such as gain controllers and analog-to-digital converters in SAR receivers, high-power interference can easily cause saturation of the SAR receiver, resulting in nonlinear distortion of the interfered echoes, which are distorted in both the time domain and frequency domain. Some scholars have analyzed the impact of SAR receiver saturation on target echoes through simulations. However, the saturation function has non-smooth characteristics, making it difficult to conduct accurate analysis using traditional analytical methods. Current related studies have approximated and analyzed the saturation function based on the hyperbolic tangent function, but there are approximation errors. Therefore, this paper proposes a saturation interference analysis model based on Bessel functions, and verifies the accuracy of the proposed saturation interference analysis model by simulating and comparing it with the traditional saturation model based on smooth function approximation. This model can provide certain guidance for further work such as saturation interference suppression.

Title: A nonlinear dead-time compensation method for path tracking control
Authors: Karin Festl, Michael Stolz
Abstract: In the realm of autonomous vehicle technologies and advanced driver assistance systems, precise and reliable path tracking controllers are vital for safe and efficient navigation. However the presence of dead time in the vehicle control systems poses a challenge to real-world systems. Input and output delays are caused by factors like sensor processing and mechanical response and can range up to a few hundred milliseconds. This chapter addresses the problem of dead time in path tracking control and proposes a method to compensate the dead time. The proposed solution involves a nonlinear prediction model, in a structure similar to the Smith predictor, but incorporating the kinematic behavior of the vehicle plant system. The implementation avoids numeric integration or optimization, enabling a fast execution. Simulation tests with various controllers and disturbances, including dead-time uncertainty, demonstrate the efficacy of the dead-time compensation method. Results indicate improved control performance in all tested scenarios.

Title: Dataset and Benchmark for Enhancing Critical Retained Foreign Object Detection
Authors: Yuli Wang, Victoria R. Shi, Liwei Zhou, Richard Chin, Yuwei Dai, Yuanyun Hu, Cheng-Yi Li, Haoyue Guan, Jiashu Cheng, Yu Sun, Cheng Ting Lin, Ihab Kamel, Premal Trivedi, Pamela Johnson, John Eng, Harrison Bai
Abstract: Critical retained foreign objects (RFOs), including surgical instruments like sponges and needles, pose serious patient safety risks and carry significant financial and legal implications for healthcare institutions. Detecting critical RFOs using artificial intelligence remains challenging due to their rarity and the limited availability of chest X-ray datasets that specifically feature critical RFOs cases. Existing datasets only contain non-critical RFOs, like necklace or zipper, further limiting their utility for developing clinically impactful detection algorithms. To address these limitations, we introduce "Hopkins RFOs Bench", the first and largest dataset of its kind, containing 144 chest X-ray images of critical RFO cases collected over 18 years from the Johns Hopkins Health System. Using this dataset, we benchmark several state-of-the-art object detection models, highlighting the need for enhanced detection methodologies for critical RFO cases. Recognizing data scarcity challenges, we further explore image synthetic methods to bridge this gap. We evaluate two advanced synthetic image methods, DeepDRR-RFO, a physics-based method, and RoentGen-RFO, a diffusion-based method, for creating realistic radiographs featuring critical RFOs. Our comprehensive analysis identifies the strengths and limitations of each synthetic method, providing insights into effectively utilizing synthetic data to enhance model training. The Hopkins RFOs Bench and our findings significantly advance the development of reliable, generalizable AI-driven solutions for detecting critical RFOs in clinical chest X-rays.

Authors: Mohammad Reza Fasihi, Brian L. Mark
Abstract: Device-to-Device (D2D) communication is a promising solution to meet the growing demands of 5G and future 6G networks by enabling direct communication between user devices. It enhances spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE), reduces latency, and supports proximity-based services. As wireless systems evolve toward 5G and 6G paradigms, the integration of D2D with advanced cellular technologies introduces new opportunities and challenges. This survey paper reviews the architectural foundations of D2D communication and explores its integration with key 5G/6G enabling technologies. We review standardization efforts, analyze core challenges, and highlight future research directions to unlock the full potential of D2D in next-generation wireless networks.

Title: SimCortex: Collision-free Simultaneous Cortical Surfaces Reconstruction
Authors: Kaveh Moradkhani, R Jarrett Rushmore, Sylvain Bouix
Abstract: Accurate cortical surface reconstruction from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data is crucial for reliable neuroanatomical analyses. Current methods have to contend with complex cortical geometries, strict topological requirements, and often produce surfaces with overlaps, self-intersections, and topological defects. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce SimCortex, a deep learning framework that simultaneously reconstructs all brain surfaces (left/right white-matter and pial) from T1-weighted(T1w) MRI volumes while preserving topological properties. Our method first segments the T1w image into a nine-class tissue label map. From these segmentations, we generate subject-specific, collision-free initial surface meshes. These surfaces serve as precise initializations for subsequent multiscale diffeomorphic deformations. Employing stationary velocity fields (SVFs) integrated via scaling-and-squaring, our approach ensures smooth, topology-preserving transformations with significantly reduced surface collisions and self-intersections. Evaluations on standard datasets demonstrate that SimCortex dramatically reduces surface overlaps and self-intersections, surpassing current methods while maintaining state-of-the-art geometric accuracy.

Title: Federated Learning-based MARL for Strengthening Physical-Layer Security in B5G Networks
Authors: Deemah H. Tashman, Soumaya Cherkaoui, Walaa Hamouda
Abstract: This paper explores the application of a federated learning-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) strategy to enhance physical-layer security (PLS) in a multi-cellular network within the context of beyond 5G networks. At each cell, a base station (BS) operates as a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent that interacts with the surrounding environment to maximize the secrecy rate of legitimate users in the presence of an eavesdropper. This eavesdropper attempts to intercept the confidential information shared between the BS and its authorized users. The DRL agents are deemed to be federated since they only share their network parameters with a central server and not the private data of their legitimate users. Two DRL approaches, deep Q-network (DQN) and Reinforce deep policy gradient (RDPG), are explored and compared. The results demonstrate that RDPG converges more rapidly than DQN. In addition, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the distributed DRL approach. Furthermore, the outcomes illustrate the trade-off between security and complexity.

Title: Deep Brain Net: An Optimized Deep Learning Model for Brain tumor Detection in MRI Images Using EfficientNetB0 and ResNet50 with Transfer Learning
Authors: Daniel Onah, Ravish Desai
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has shown great promise in the automated detection and classification of brain tumors from MRI images. However, achieving high accuracy and computational efficiency remains a challenge. In this research, we propose Deep Brain Net, a novel deep learning system designed to optimize performance in the detection of brain tumors. The model integrates the strengths of two advanced neural network architectures which are EfficientNetB0 and ResNet50, combined with transfer learning to improve generalization and reduce training time. The EfficientNetB0 architecture enhances model efficiency by utilizing mobile inverted bottleneck blocks, which incorporate depth wise separable convolutions. This design significantly reduces the number of parameters and computational cost while preserving the ability of models to learn complex feature representations. The ResNet50 architecture, pre trained on large scale datasets like ImageNet, is fine tuned for brain tumor classification. Its use of residual connections allows for training deeper networks by mitigating the vanishing gradient problem and avoiding performance degradation. The integration of these components ensures that the proposed system is both computationally efficient and highly accurate. Extensive experiments performed on publicly available MRI datasets demonstrate that Deep Brain Net consistently outperforms existing state of the art methods in terms of classification accuracy, precision, recall, and computational efficiency. The result is an accuracy of 88 percent, a weighted F1 score of 88.75 percent, and a macro AUC ROC score of 98.17 percent which demonstrates the robustness and clinical potential of Deep Brain Net in assisting radiologists with brain tumor diagnosis.

Title: How to Bridge the Sim-to-Real Gap in Digital Twin-Aided Telecommunication Networks
Authors: Clement Ruah, Houssem Sifaou, Osvaldo Simeone, Bashir M. Al-Hashimi
Abstract: Training effective artificial intelligence models for telecommunications is challenging due to the scarcity of deployment-specific data. Real data collection is expensive, and available datasets often fail to capture the unique operational conditions and contextual variability of the network environment. Digital twinning provides a potential solution to this problem, as simulators tailored to the current network deployment can generate site-specific data to augment the available training datasets. However, there is a need to develop solutions to bridge the inherent simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) gap between synthetic and real-world data. This paper reviews recent advances on two complementary strategies: 1) the calibration of digital twins (DTs) through real-world measurements, and 2) the use of sim-to-real gap-aware training strategies to robustly handle residual discrepancies between digital twin-generated and real data. For the latter, we evaluate two conceptually distinct methods that model the sim-to-real gap either at the level of the environment via Bayesian learning or at the level of the training loss via prediction-powered inference.

Title: Deep Feed-Forward Neural Network for Bangla Isolated Speech Recognition
Authors: Dipayan Bhadra, Mehrab Hosain, Fatema Alam
Abstract: As the most important human-machine interfacing tool, an insignificant amount of work has been carried out on Bangla Speech Recognition compared to the English language. Motivated by this, in this work, the performance of speaker-independent isolated speech recognition systems has been implemented and analyzed using a dataset that is created containing both isolated Bangla and English spoken words. An approach using the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) and Deep Feed-Forward Fully Connected Neural Network (DFFNN) of 7 layers as a classifier is proposed in this work to recognize isolated spoken words. This work shows 93.42% recognition accuracy which is better compared to most of the works done previously on Bangla speech recognition considering the number of classes and dataset size.

Title: Joint Target Acquisition and Refined Position Estimation in OFDM-based ISAC Networks
Authors: Lorenzo Pucci, Andrea Giorgetti
Abstract: This paper addresses joint target acquisition and position estimation in an OFDM-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) network with base station (BS) cooperation via a fusion center. A two-stage framework is proposed: in the first stage, each BS computes range-angle maps to detect targets and estimate coarse positions, exploiting spatial diversity. In the second stage, refined localization is performed using a cooperative maximum likelihood (ML) estimator over predefined regions of interest (RoIs) within a shared global reference frame. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach not only improves detection performance through BS cooperation but also achieves centimeter-level localization accuracy, highlighting the effectiveness of the refined estimation technique.

Title: Incremental Averaging Method to Improve Graph-Based Time-Difference-of-Arrival Estimation
Authors: Klaus Brümann, Kouei Yamaoka, Nobutaka Ono, Simon Doclo
Abstract: Estimating the position of a speech source based on time-differences-of-arrival (TDOAs) is often adversely affected by background noise and reverberation. A popular method to estimate the TDOA between a microphone pair involves maximizing a generalized cross-correlation with phase transform (GCC-PHAT) function. Since the TDOAs across different microphone pairs satisfy consistency relations, generally only a small subset of microphone pairs are used for source position estimation. Although the set of microphone pairs is often determined based on a reference microphone, recently a more robust method has been proposed to determine the set of microphone pairs by computing the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a signal graph of GCC-PHAT function reliabilities. To reduce the influence of noise and reverberation on the TDOA estimation accuracy, in this paper we propose to compute the GCC-PHAT functions of the MST based on an average of multiple cross-power spectral densities (CPSDs) using an incremental method. In each step of the method, we increase the number of CPSDs over which we average by considering CPSDs computed indirectly via other microphones from previous steps. Using signals recorded in a noisy and reverberant laboratory with an array of spatially distributed microphones, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated in terms of TDOA estimation error and 2D source position estimation error. Experimental results for different source and microphone configurations and three reverberation conditions show that the proposed method considering multiple CPSDs improves the TDOA estimation and source position estimation accuracy compared to the reference microphone- and MST-based methods that rely on a single CPSD as well as steered-response power-based source position estimation.

Title: Super Kawaii Vocalics: Amplifying the "Cute" Factor in Computer Voice
Authors: Yuto Mandai, Katie Seaborn, Tomoyasu Nakano, Xin Sun, Yijia Wang, Jun Kato
Abstract: "Kawaii" is the Japanese concept of cute, which carries sociocultural connotations related to social identities and emotional responses. Yet, virtually all work to date has focused on the visual side of kawaii, including in studies of computer agents and social robots. In pursuit of formalizing the new science of kawaii vocalics, we explored what elements of voice relate to kawaii and how they might be manipulated, manually and automatically. We conducted a four-phase study (grand N = 512) with two varieties of computer voices: text-to-speech (TTS) and game character voices. We found kawaii "sweet spots" through manipulation of fundamental and formant frequencies, but only for certain voices and to a certain extent. Findings also suggest a ceiling effect for the kawaii vocalics of certain voices. We offer empirical validation of the preliminary kawaii vocalics model and an elementary method for manipulating kawaii perceptions of computer voice.

Title: Attacker's Noise Can Manipulate Your Audio-based LLM in the Real World
Authors: Vinu Sankar Sadasivan, Soheil Feizi, Rajiv Mathews, Lun Wang
Abstract: This paper investigates the real-world vulnerabilities of audio-based large language models (ALLMs), such as Qwen2-Audio. We first demonstrate that an adversary can craft stealthy audio perturbations to manipulate ALLMs into exhibiting specific targeted behaviors, such as eliciting responses to wake-keywords (e.g., "Hey Qwen"), or triggering harmful behaviors (e.g. "Change my calendar event"). Subsequently, we show that playing adversarial background noise during user interaction with the ALLMs can significantly degrade the response quality. Crucially, our research illustrates the scalability of these attacks to real-world scenarios, impacting other innocent users when these adversarial noises are played through the air. Further, we discuss the transferrability of the attack, and potential defensive measures.

Title: Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning Controller for Deep Brain Stimulation in Parkinson's Disease
Authors: Harsh Ravivarapu, Gaurav Bagwe, Xiaoyong Yuan, Chunxiu Yu, Lan Zhang
Abstract: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established intervention for Parkinson's disease (PD), but conventional open-loop systems lack adaptability, are energy-inefficient due to continuous stimulation, and provide limited personalization to individual neural dynamics. Adaptive DBS (aDBS) offers a closed-loop alternative, using biomarkers such as beta-band oscillations to dynamically modulate stimulation. While reinforcement learning (RL) holds promise for personalized aDBS control, existing methods suffer from high sample complexity, unstable exploration in binary action spaces, and limited deployability on resource-constrained hardware. We propose SEA-DBS, a sample-efficient actor-critic framework that addresses the core challenges of RL-based adaptive neurostimulation. SEA-DBS integrates a predictive reward model to reduce reliance on real-time feedback and employs Gumbel Softmax-based exploration for stable, differentiable policy updates in binary action spaces. Together, these components improve sample efficiency, exploration robustness, and compatibility with resource-constrained neuromodulatory hardware. We evaluate SEA-DBS on a biologically realistic simulation of Parkinsonian basal ganglia activity, demonstrating faster convergence, stronger suppression of pathological beta-band power, and resilience to post-training FP16 quantization. Our results show that SEA-DBS offers a practical and effective RL-based aDBS framework for real-time, resource-constrained neuromodulation.

Title: MixAssist: An Audio-Language Dataset for Co-Creative AI Assistance in Music Mixing
Authors: Michael Clemens, Ana Marasović
Abstract: While AI presents significant potential for enhancing music mixing and mastering workflows, current research predominantly emphasizes end-to-end automation or generation, often overlooking the collaborative and instructional dimensions vital for co-creative processes. This gap leaves artists, particularly amateurs seeking to develop expertise, underserved. To bridge this, we introduce MixAssist, a novel audio-language dataset capturing the situated, multi-turn dialogue between expert and amateur music producers during collaborative mixing sessions. Comprising 431 audio-grounded conversational turns derived from 7 in-depth sessions involving 12 producers, MixAssist provides a unique resource for training and evaluating audio-language models that can comprehend and respond to the complexities of real-world music production dialogues. Our evaluations, including automated LLM-as-a-judge assessments and human expert comparisons, demonstrate that fine-tuning models such as Qwen-Audio on MixAssist can yield promising results, with Qwen significantly outperforming other tested models in generating helpful, contextually relevant mixing advice. By focusing on co-creative instruction grounded in audio context, MixAssist enables the development of intelligent AI assistants designed to support and augment the creative process in music mixing.

Title: Detection of Intelligent Tampering in Wireless Electrocardiogram Signals Using Hybrid Machine Learning
Authors: Siddhant Deshpande, Yalemzerf Getnet, Waltenegus Dargie
Abstract: With the proliferation of wireless electrocardiogram (ECG) systems for health monitoring and authentication, protecting signal integrity against tampering is becoming increasingly important. This paper analyzes the performance of CNN, ResNet, and hybrid Transformer-CNN models for tamper detection. It also evaluates the performance of a Siamese network for ECG based identity verification. Six tampering strategies, including structured segment substitutions and random insertions, are emulated to mimic real world attacks. The one-dimensional ECG signals are transformed into a two dimensional representation in the time frequency domain using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). The models are trained and evaluated using ECG data from 54 subjects recorded in four sessions 2019 to 2025 outside of clinical settings while the subjects performed seven different daily activities. Experimental results show that in highly fragmented manipulation scenarios, CNN, FeatCNN-TranCNN, FeatCNN-Tran and ResNet models achieved an accuracy exceeding 99.5 percent . Similarly, for subtle manipulations (for example, 50 percent from A and 50 percent from B and, 75 percent from A and 25 percent from B substitutions) our FeatCNN-TranCNN model demonstrated consistently reliable performance, achieving an average accuracy of 98 percent . For identity verification, the pure Transformer-Siamese network achieved an average accuracy of 98.30 percent . In contrast, the hybrid CNN-Transformer Siamese model delivered perfect verification performance with 100 percent accuracy.

Title: Evaluating Robots Like Human Infants: A Case Study of Learned Bipedal Locomotion
Authors: Devin Crowley, Whitney G. Cole, Christina M. Hospodar, Ruiting Shen, Karen E. Adolph, Alan Fern
Abstract: Typically, learned robot controllers are trained via relatively unsystematic regimens and evaluated with coarse-grained outcome measures such as average cumulative reward. The typical approach is useful to compare learning algorithms but provides limited insight into the effects of different training regimens and little understanding about the richness and complexity of learned behaviors. Likewise, human infants and other animals are "trained" via unsystematic regimens, but in contrast, developmental psychologists evaluate their performance in highly-controlled experiments with fine-grained measures such as success, speed of walking, and prospective adjustments. However, the study of learned behavior in human infants is limited by the practical constraints of training and testing babies. Here, we present a case study that applies methods from developmental psychology to study the learned behavior of the simulated bipedal robot Cassie. Following research on infant walking, we systematically designed reinforcement learning training regimens and tested the resulting controllers in simulated environments analogous to those used for babies--but without the practical constraints. Results reveal new insights into the behavioral impact of different training regimens and the development of Cassie's learned behaviors relative to infants who are learning to walk. This interdisciplinary baby-robot approach provides inspiration for future research designed to systematically test effects of training on the development of complex learned robot behaviors.

Title: eegFloss: A Python package for refining sleep EEG recordings using machine learning models
Authors: Niloy Sikder, Paul Zerr, Mahdad Jafarzadeh Esfahani, Martin Dresler, Matthias Krauledat
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) allows monitoring of brain activity, providing insights into the functional dynamics of various brain regions and their roles in cognitive processes. EEG is a cornerstone in sleep research, serving as the primary modality of polysomnography, the gold standard in the field. However, EEG signals are prone to artifacts caused by both internal (device-specific) factors and external (environmental) interferences. As sleep studies are becoming larger, most rely on automatic sleep staging, a process highly susceptible to artifacts, leading to erroneous sleep scores. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing eegFloss, an open-source Python package to utilize eegUsability, a novel machine learning (ML) model designed to detect segments with artifacts in sleep EEG recordings. eegUsability has been trained and evaluated on manually artifact-labeled EEG data collected from 15 participants over 127 nights using the Zmax headband. It demonstrates solid overall classification performance (F1-score is approximately 0.85, Cohens kappa is 0.78), achieving a high recall rate of approximately 94% in identifying channel-wise usable EEG data, and extends beyond Zmax. Additionally, eegFloss offers features such as automatic time-in-bed detection using another ML model named eegMobility, filtering out certain artifacts, and generating hypnograms and sleep statistics. By addressing a fundamental challenge faced by most sleep studies, eegFloss can enhance the precision and rigor of their analysis as well as the accuracy and reliability of their outcomes.

Building safe and secure vehicles demands a profound understanding of automotive systems, particularly in safety and security. Traditional learning approaches, such as reading materials or observing demonstrations, often fail to provide the practical, hands-on experience essential for developing this expertise. For novice users, gaining access to automotive-grade systems and mastering their associated hardware and software can be challenging and overwhelming. In this paper, we present a novel, affordable, and flexible exploration platform, \hema, that enables users to gain practical, hands-on insights into the security compromises of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors, a critical component in modern ADAS systems. Furthermore, we discuss the unique challenges and design considerations involved in creating such a platform, emphasizing its role in enhancing the understanding of automotive safety and security. This framework serves as an invaluable resource for educators, researchers, and practitioners striving to build expertise in the field.

Title: Distributed Optimization of Finite Condition Number for Laplacian Matrix in Multi-Agent Systems
Authors: Yicheng Xu, Faryar Jabbari
Abstract: This paper addresses the distributed optimization of the finite condition number of the Laplacian matrix in multi-agent systems. The finite condition number, defined as the ratio of the largest to the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix, plays an important role in determining the convergence rate and performance of consensus algorithms, especially in discrete-time implementations. We propose a fully distributed algorithm by regulating the node weights. The approach leverages max consensus, distributed power iteration, and consensus-based normalization for eigenvalue and eigenvector estimation, requiring only local communication and computation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves performance comparable to centralized LMI-based optimization, significantly improving consensus speed and multi-agent system performance. The framework can be extended to edge weight optimization and the scenarios with non-simple eigenvalues, highlighting its scalability and practical applicability for large-scale networked systems.

Title: IMPACT: Industrial Machine Perception via Acoustic Cognitive Transformer
Authors: Changheon Han, Yuseop Sim, Hoin Jung, Jiho Lee, Hojun Lee, Yun Seok Kang, Sucheol Woo, Garam Kim, Hyung Wook Park, Martin Byung-Guk Jun
Abstract: Acoustic signals from industrial machines offer valuable insights for anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, and operational efficiency enhancement. However, existing task-specific, supervised learning methods often scale poorly and fail to generalize across diverse industrial scenarios, whose acoustic characteristics are distinct from general audio. Furthermore, the scarcity of accessible, large-scale datasets and pretrained models tailored for industrial audio impedes community-driven research and benchmarking. To address these challenges, we introduce DINOS (Diverse INdustrial Operation Sounds), a large-scale open-access dataset. DINOS comprises over 74,149 audio samples (exceeding 1,093 hours) collected from various industrial acoustic scenarios. We also present IMPACT (Industrial Machine Perception via Acoustic Cognitive Transformer), a novel foundation model for industrial machine sound analysis. IMPACT is pretrained on DINOS in a self-supervised manner. By jointly optimizing utterance and frame-level losses, it captures both global semantics and fine-grained temporal structures. This makes its representations suitable for efficient fine-tuning on various industrial downstream tasks with minimal labeled data. Comprehensive benchmarking across 30 distinct downstream tasks (spanning four machine types) demonstrates that IMPACT outperforms existing models on 24 tasks, establishing its superior effectiveness and robustness, while providing a new performance benchmark for future research.

Title: Transferable Parasitic Estimation via Graph Contrastive Learning and Label Rebalancing in AMS Circuits
Authors: Shan Shen, Shenglu Hua, Jiajun Zou, Jiawei Liu, Jianwang Zhai, Chuan Shi, Wenjian Yu
Abstract: Graph representation learning on Analog-Mixed Signal (AMS) circuits is crucial for various downstream tasks, e.g., parasitic estimation. However, the scarcity of design data, the unbalanced distribution of labels, and the inherent diversity of circuit implementations pose significant challenges to learning robust and transferable circuit representations. To address these limitations, we propose CircuitGCL, a novel graph contrastive learning framework that integrates representation scattering and label rebalancing to enhance transferability across heterogeneous circuit graphs. CircuitGCL employs a self-supervised strategy to learn topology-invariant node embeddings through hyperspherical representation scattering, eliminating dependency on large-scale data. Simultaneously, balanced mean squared error (MSE) and softmax cross-entropy (bsmCE) losses are introduced to mitigate label distribution disparities between circuits, enabling robust and transferable parasitic estimation. Evaluated on parasitic capacitance estimation (edge-level task) and ground capacitance classification (node-level task) across TSMC 28nm AMS designs, CircuitGCL outperforms all state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with the $R^2$ improvement of $33.64\% \sim 44.20\%$ for edge regression and F1-score gain of $0.9\times \sim 2.1\times$ for node classification.

Title: Few-shot Learning on AMS Circuits and Its Application to Parasitic Capacitance Prediction
Authors: Shan Shen, Yibin Zhang, Hector Rodriguez Rodriguez, Wenjian Yu
Abstract: Graph representation learning is a powerful method to extract features from graph-structured data, such as analog/mixed-signal (AMS) circuits. However, training deep learning models for AMS designs is severely limited by the scarcity of integrated circuit design data. In this work, we present CircuitGPS, a few-shot learning method for parasitic effect prediction in AMS circuits. The circuit netlist is represented as a heterogeneous graph, with the coupling capacitance modeled as a link. CircuitGPS is pre-trained on link prediction and fine-tuned on edge regression. The proposed method starts with a small-hop sampling technique that converts a link or a node into a subgraph. Then, the subgraph embeddings are learned with a hybrid graph Transformer. Additionally, CircuitGPS integrates a low-cost positional encoding that summarizes the positional and structural information of the sampled subgraph. CircuitGPS improves the accuracy of coupling existence by at least 20\% and reduces the MAE of capacitance estimation by at least 0.067 compared to existing methods. Our method demonstrates strong inherent scalability, enabling direct application to diverse AMS circuit designs through zero-shot learning. Furthermore, the ablation studies provide valuable insights into graph models for representation learning.

Title: Deep-Learning-Based Pre-Layout Parasitic Capacitance Prediction on SRAM Designs
Authors: Shan Shen, Dingcheng Yang, Yuyang Xie, Chunyan Pei, Wenjian Yu, Bei Yu
Abstract: To achieve higher system energy efficiency, SRAM in SoCs is often customized. The parasitic effects cause notable discrepancies between pre-layout and post-layout circuit simulations, leading to difficulty in converging design parameters and excessive design iterations. Is it possible to well predict the parasitics based on the pre-layout circuit, so as to perform parasitic-aware pre-layout simulation? In this work, we propose a deep-learning-based 2-stage model to accurately predict these parasitics in pre-layout stages. The model combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) classifier and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) regressors, effectively managing class imbalance of the net parasitics in SRAM circuits. We also employ Focal Loss to mitigate the impact of abundant internal net samples and integrate subcircuit information into the graph to abstract the hierarchical structure of schematics. Experiments on 4 real SRAM designs show that our approach not only surpasses the state-of-the-art model in parasitic prediction by a maximum of 19X reduction of error but also significantly boosts the simulation process by up to 598X speedup.

Title: SkyVLN: Vision-and-Language Navigation and NMPC Control for UAVs in Urban Environments
Authors: Tianshun Li, Tianyi Huai, Zhen Li, Yichun Gao, Haoang Li, Xinhu Zheng
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as versatile tools across various sectors, driven by their mobility and adaptability. This paper introduces SkyVLN, a novel framework integrating vision-and-language navigation (VLN) with Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) to enhance UAV autonomy in complex urban environments. Unlike traditional navigation methods, SkyVLN leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret natural language instructions and visual observations, enabling UAVs to navigate through dynamic 3D spaces with improved accuracy and robustness. We present a multimodal navigation agent equipped with a fine-grained spatial verbalizer and a history path memory mechanism. These components allow the UAV to disambiguate spatial contexts, handle ambiguous instructions, and backtrack when necessary. The framework also incorporates an NMPC module for dynamic obstacle avoidance, ensuring precise trajectory tracking and collision prevention. To validate our approach, we developed a high-fidelity 3D urban simulation environment using AirSim, featuring realistic imagery and dynamic urban elements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SkyVLN significantly improves navigation success rates and efficiency, particularly in new and unseen environments.

Title: Hybrid Quantum Convolutional Neural Network-Aided Pilot Assignment in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems
Authors: Doan Hieu Nguyen, Xuan Tung Nguyen, Seon-Geun Jeong, Trinh Van Chien, Lajos Hanzo, Won Joo Hwang
Abstract: A sophisticated hybrid quantum convolutional neural network (HQCNN) is conceived for handling the pilot assignment task in cell-free massive MIMO systems, while maximizing the total ergodic sum throughput. The existing model-based solutions found in the literature are inefficient and/or computationally demanding. Similarly, conventional deep neural networks may struggle in the face of high-dimensional inputs, require complex architectures, and their convergence is slow due to training numerous hyperparameters. The proposed HQCNN leverages parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) relying on superposition for enhanced feature extraction. Specifically, we exploit the same PQC across all the convolutional layers for customizing the neural network and for accelerating the convergence. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed HQCNN offers a total network throughput close to that of the excessive-complexity exhaustive search and outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Title: Soft Robotics-Inspired Flexible Antenna Arrays
Authors: Elio Faddoul, Andreas Nicolaides, Konstantinos Ntougias, Ioannis Krikidis
Abstract: In this work, a novel soft continuum robot-inspired antenna array is proposed, featuring tentacle-like structures with multiple antenna elements. The proposed array achieves reconfigurability through continuous deformation of its geometry, in contrast to reconfigurable antennas which incur a per-element control. More specifically, the deformation is modeled by amplitude and spatial frequency parameters. We consider a multi-user multiple-input single-output downlink system, whereby the optimal deformation parameters are found to maximize the sum rate in the network. A successive convex approximation method is adopted to solve the problem. Numerical results show that the proposed deformable array significantly outperforms fixed geometry and per-element reconfigurable arrays in sum rate, demonstrating the benefits of structure-level flexibility for next-generation antenna arrays.

Title: Capturing Stable HDR Videos Using a Dual-Camera System
Authors: Qianyu Zhang, Bolun Zheng, Hangjia Pan, Lingyu Zhu, Zunjie Zhu, Zongpeng Li, Shiqi Wang
Abstract: In HDR video reconstruction, exposure fluctuations in reference images from alternating exposure methods often result in flickering. To address this issue, we propose a dual-camera system (DCS) for HDR video acquisition, where one camera is assigned to capture consistent reference sequences, while the other is assigned to capture non-reference sequences for information supplementation. To tackle the challenges posed by video data, we introduce an exposure-adaptive fusion network (EAFNet) to achieve more robust results. EAFNet introduced a pre-alignment subnetwork to explore the influence of exposure, selectively emphasizing the valuable features across different exposure levels. Then, the enhanced features are fused by the asymmetric cross-feature fusion subnetwork, which explores reference-dominated attention maps to improve image fusion by aligning cross-scale features and performing cross-feature fusion. Finally, the reconstruction subnetwork adopts a DWT-based multiscale architecture to reduce ghosting artifacts and refine features at different resolutions. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on different datasets, validating the great potential of the DCS in HDR video reconstruction. The codes and data captured by DCS will be available at this https URL.

Title: STARS: A Unified Framework for Singing Transcription, Alignment, and Refined Style Annotation
Authors: Wenxiang Guo, Yu Zhang, Changhao Pan, Zhiyuan Zhu, Ruiqi Li, Zhetao Chen, Wenhao Xu, Fei Wu, Zhou Zhao
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in singing voice synthesis (SVS) have heightened the demand for high-quality annotated datasets, yet manual annotation remains prohibitively labor-intensive and resource-intensive. Existing automatic singing annotation (ASA) methods, however, primarily tackle isolated aspects of the annotation pipeline. To address this fundamental challenge, we present STARS, which is, to our knowledge, the first unified framework that simultaneously addresses singing transcription, alignment, and refined style annotation. Our framework delivers comprehensive multi-level annotations encompassing: (1) precise phoneme-audio alignment, (2) robust note transcription and temporal localization, (3) expressive vocal technique identification, and (4) global stylistic characterization including emotion and pace. The proposed architecture employs hierarchical acoustic feature processing across frame, word, phoneme, note, and sentence levels. The novel non-autoregressive local acoustic encoders enable structured hierarchical representation learning. Experimental validation confirms the framework's superior performance across multiple evaluation dimensions compared to existing annotation approaches. Furthermore, applications in SVS training demonstrate that models utilizing STARS-annotated data achieve significantly enhanced perceptual naturalness and precise style control. This work not only overcomes critical scalability challenges in the creation of singing datasets but also pioneers new methodologies for controllable singing voice synthesis.

Title: Exploring State-Space-Model based Language Model in Music Generation
Authors: Wei-Jaw Lee, Fang-Chih Hsieh, Xuanjun Chen, Fang-Duo Tsai, Yi-Hsuan Yang
Abstract: The recent surge in State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the emergence of Mamba, has established them as strong alternatives or complementary modules to Transformers across diverse domains. In this work, we aim to explore the potential of Mamba-based architectures for text-to-music generation. We adopt discrete tokens of Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) as the modeling representation and empirically find that a single-layer codebook can capture semantic information in music. Motivated by this observation, we focus on modeling a single-codebook representation and adapt SiMBA, originally designed as a Mamba-based encoder, to function as a decoder for sequence modeling. We compare its performance against a standard Transformer-based decoder. Our results suggest that, under limited-resource settings, SiMBA achieves much faster convergence and generates outputs closer to the ground truth. This demonstrates the promise of SSMs for efficient and expressive text-to-music generation. We put audio examples on Github.

Title: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks for Short-term State Forecasting in Power Systems across Domains and Time Scales: A Hydroelectric Power Plant Case Study
Authors: Raffael Theiler, Olga Fink
Abstract: Accurate short-term state forecasting is essential for efficient and stable operation of modern power systems, especially in the context of increasing variability introduced by renewable and distributed energy resources. As these systems evolve rapidly, it becomes increasingly important to reliably predict their states in the short term to ensure operational stability, support control decisions, and enable interpretable monitoring of sensor and machine behavior. Modern power systems often span multiple physical domains - including electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, and thermal - posing significant challenges for modeling and prediction. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising data-driven framework for system state estimation and state forecasting in such settings. By leveraging the topological structure of sensor networks, GNNs can implicitly learn inter-sensor relationships and propagate information across the network. However, most existing GNN-based methods are designed under the assumption of homogeneous sensor relationships and are typically constrained to a single physical domain. This limitation restricts their ability to integrate and reason over heterogeneous sensor data commonly encountered in real-world energy systems, such as those used in energy conversion infrastructure. In this work, we propose the use of Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks to address these limitations. Our approach models both homogeneous intra-domain and heterogeneous inter-domain relationships among sensor data from two distinct physical domains - hydraulic and electrical - which exhibit fundamentally different temporal dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms conventional baselines on average by 35.5% in terms of normalized root mean square error, confirming its effectiveness in multi-domain, multi-rate power system state forecasting.

Title: Mathematical Modelling of Oscillatory Dynamics in Circular Traffic Systems
Authors: Craig S Wright
Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous analytical model of traffic dynamics on a circular track, demonstrating the emergence of standing oscillations resulting from microscopic driver behaviour, delay responses, and proximity pressure. Without relying on simulation, we derive a series of coupled delay differential equations to model vehicular interactions. By introducing a mnemonic-based symbolic system, we establish a mathematical framework incorporating stochastic initial conditions, non-uniform reaction times, and cognitive lag. A full linear stability analysis is conducted using Fourier decomposition and modal perturbation techniques. Our results identify critical thresholds for harmonic induction, delineate the bounds of safe following distances, and reveal hysteresis in driver overcorrection. The analysis concludes with implications for autonomous vehicle control and potential suppression strategies for oscillatory instability. All derivations are purely symbolic and analytically proven.

Title: Distributed Fault-Tolerant Multi-Robot Cooperative Localization in Adversarial Environments
Authors: Tohid Kargar Tasooji, Ramviyas Parasuraman
Abstract: In multi-robot systems (MRS), cooperative localization is a crucial task for enhancing system robustness and scalability, especially in GPS-denied or communication-limited environments. However, adversarial attacks, such as sensor manipulation, and communication jamming, pose significant challenges to the performance of traditional localization methods. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed fault-tolerant cooperative localization framework to enhance resilience against sensor and communication disruptions in adversarial environments. We introduce an adaptive event-triggered communication strategy that dynamically adjusts communication thresholds based on real-time sensing and communication quality. This strategy ensures optimal performance even in the presence of sensor degradation or communication failure. Furthermore, we conduct a rigorous analysis of the convergence and stability properties of the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its resilience against bounded adversarial zones and maintaining accurate state estimation. Robotarium-based experiment results show that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of localization accuracy and communication efficiency, particularly in adversarial settings. Our approach offers improved scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance for MRS, making it suitable for large-scale deployments in real-world, challenging environments.

Title: Constraint Optimized Multichannel Mixer-limiter Design
Authors: Yuancheng Luo, Dmitriy Yamkovoy, Guillermo Garcia
Abstract: Multichannel audio mixer and limiter designs are conventionally decoupled for content reproduction over loudspeaker arrays due to high computational complexity and run-time costs. We propose a coupled mixer-limiter-envelope design formulated as an efficient linear-constrained quadratic program that minimizes a distortion objective over multichannel gain variables subject to sample mixture constraints. Novel methods for asymmetric constant overlap-add window optimization, objective function approximation, variable and constraint reduction are presented. Experiments demonstrate distortion reduction of the coupled design, and computational trade-offs required for efficient real-time processing.

Title: Stream Function-Based Navigation for Complex Quadcopter Obstacle Avoidance
Authors: Sean Smith, Emmanuel Witrant, Ya-Jun Pan
Abstract: This article presents a novel stream function-based navigational control system for obstacle avoidance, where obstacles are represented as two-dimensional (2D) rigid surfaces in inviscid, incompressible flows. The approach leverages the vortex panel method (VPM) and incorporates safety margins to control the stream function and flow properties around virtual surfaces, enabling navigation in complex, partially observed environments using real-time sensing. To address the limitations of the VPM in managing relative distance and avoiding rapidly accelerating obstacles at close proximity, the system integrates a model predictive controller (MPC) based on higher-order control barrier functions (HOCBF). This integration incorporates VPM trajectory generation, state estimation, and constraint handling into a receding-horizon optimization problem. The 2D rigid surfaces are enclosed using minimum bounding ellipses (MBEs), while an adaptive Kalman filter (AKF) captures and predicts obstacle dynamics, propagating these estimates into the MPC-HOCBF for rapid avoidance maneuvers. Evaluation is conducted using a PX4-powered Clover drone Gazebo simulator and real-time experiments involving a COEX Clover quadcopter equipped with a 360 degree LiDAR sensor.

Title: Dynamic Output-Feedback Controller Synthesis for Dissipativity from Noisy Input-State Data
Authors: Pietro Kristović, Andrej Jokić, Mircea Lazar
Abstract: In this paper we propose a dynamic output-feedback controller synthesis method for discrete-time linear time-invariant systems. The synthesis goal is to render closed-loop system dissipative with respect to a given generic unstructured quadratic supply rate, while the system dynamics is partially represented by input-state data corrupted by a bounded disturbance. The controller synthesis is performed with respect to all systems which are consistent with the available data, and it is formulated in terms of a linear matrix inequality parametrized by a scalar variable, so that the synthesis can be performed using line search and convex optimization. Within the considered setting, the proposed synthesis procedure is non-conservative in a sense that it is based on conditions which are both necessary and sufficient.

Title: Revealing the Hidden Temporal Structure of HubertSoft Embeddings based on the Russian Phonetic Corpus
Authors: Anastasia Ananeva, Anton Tomilov, Marina Volkova
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) models such as Wav2Vec 2.0 and HuBERT have shown remarkable success in extracting phonetic information from raw audio without labelled data. While prior work has demonstrated that SSL embeddings encode phonetic features at the frame level, it remains unclear whether these models preserve temporal structure, specifically, whether embeddings at phoneme boundaries reflect the identity and order of adjacent phonemes. This study investigates the extent to which boundary-sensitive embeddings from HubertSoft, a soft-clustering variant of HuBERT, encode phoneme transitions. Using the CORPRES Russian speech corpus, we labelled 20 ms embedding windows with triplets of phonemes corresponding to their start, centre, and end segments. A neural network was trained to predict these positions separately, and multiple evaluation metrics, such as ordered, unordered accuracy and a flexible centre accuracy, were used to assess temporal sensitivity. Results show that embeddings extracted at phoneme boundaries capture both phoneme identity and temporal order, with especially high accuracy at segment boundaries. Confusion patterns further suggest that the model encodes articulatory detail and coarticulatory effects. These findings contribute to our understanding of the internal structure of SSL speech representations and their potential for phonological analysis and fine-grained transcription tasks.

Abstract: Plant traits such as leaf carbon content and leaf mass are essential variables in the study of biodiversity and climate change. However, conventional field sampling cannot feasibly cover trait variation at ecologically meaningful spatial scales. Machine learning represents a valuable solution for plant trait prediction across ecosystems, leveraging hyperspectral data from remote sensing. Nevertheless, trait prediction from hyperspectral data is challenged by label scarcity and substantial domain shifts (\eg across sensors, ecological distributions), requiring robust cross-domain methods. Here, we present GreenHyperSpectra, a pretraining dataset encompassing real-world cross-sensor and cross-ecosystem samples designed to benchmark trait prediction with semi- and self-supervised methods. We adopt an evaluation framework encompassing in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. We successfully leverage GreenHyperSpectra to pretrain label-efficient multi-output regression models that outperform the state-of-the-art supervised baseline. Our empirical analyses demonstrate substantial improvements in learning spectral representations for trait prediction, establishing a comprehensive methodological framework to catalyze research at the intersection of representation learning and plant functional traits assessment.

Title: Data-Balanced Curriculum Learning for Audio Question Answering
Authors: Gijs Wijngaard, Elia Formisano, Michele Esposito, Michel Dumontier
Abstract: Audio question answering (AQA) requires models to understand acoustic content and perform complex reasoning. Current models struggle with dataset imbalances and unstable training dynamics. This work combines curriculum learning with statistical data balancing to address these challenges. The method labels question difficulty using language models, then trains progressively from easy to hard examples. Statistical filtering removes overrepresented audio categories, and guided decoding constrains outputs to valid multiple-choice formats. Experiments on the DCASE 2025 training set and five additional public datasets show that data curation improves accuracy by 11.7% over baseline models, achieving 64.2% on the DCASE 2025 benchmark.

Title: Physics-Informed Direction-Aware Neural Acoustic Fields
Authors: Yoshiki Masuyama, François G. Germain, Gordon Wichern, Christopher Ick, Jonathan Le Roux
Abstract: This paper presents a physics-informed neural network (PINN) for modeling first-order Ambisonic (FOA) room impulse responses (RIRs). PINNs have demonstrated promising performance in sound field interpolation by combining the powerful modeling capability of neural networks and the physical principles of sound propagation. In room acoustics, PINNs have typically been trained to represent the sound pressure measured by omnidirectional microphones where the wave equation or its frequency-domain counterpart, i.e., the Helmholtz equation, is leveraged. Meanwhile, FOA RIRs additionally provide spatial characteristics and are useful for immersive audio generation with a wide range of applications. In this paper, we extend the PINN framework to model FOA RIRs. We derive two physics-informed priors for FOA RIRs based on the correspondence between the particle velocity and the (X, Y, Z)-channels of FOA. These priors associate the predicted W-channel and other channels through their partial derivatives and impose the physically feasible relationship on the four channels. Our experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with a neural network without the physics-informed prior.

Title: Formalization of the AADL Run-Time Services with Time
Authors: Brian R Larson, Ehsan Ahmad
Abstract: The Architecture Analysis & Design Language (AADL) is an architecture description language for design of cyber-physical systems--machines controlled by software. The AADL standard, SAE International AS5506D, describes Run-Time Services (RTS) to be provided to execute AADL models in accordance with semantics defined by the standard. The RTS of primary concern are transport services and timing services. Although, the study presented in [1] sets a foundation for the formal semantics of AADL, but without modeling time. This paper extends and simplifies this formalization using a modal logic defined by a Kripke structure, to explicitly include time. The RTS defined in the AADL standard are also expanded to support reactive state-transition machines of the Behavior Specification annex standard language (BA) and its closely-related, formally-defined counterpart, the Behavior Language for Embedded Systems with Software (BLESS). An example of AADL RTS with time, implemented by the High Assurance Modeling and Rapid Engineering for Embedded Systems (HAMR) for state-transition machine behavior written in BLESS, is also presented.

Title: Manifolds in Power Systems Optimization
Authors: Lucca Rodrigues Pinto, Wilson de Souza Junior, Jaime Laelson Jacob, Luis Alfonso Gallego Pareja, Taufik Abrão
Abstract: Manifold optimization (MO) is a powerful mathematical framework that can be applied to solving complex optimization problems with objective functions (OFs) and constraints on complex geometric structures, which is particularly useful in advanced power systems. We explore the application of MO techniques, which offer a robust framework for solving complex, non-convex optimization problems in electrical power distribution systems (EPDS) and electrical power transmission systems (EPTS), particularly for power flow analysis. This paper introduces the principles of MO and demonstrates its advantages over conventional methods by applying it to power flow optimization. For EPDS, a cost function derived from a backward-forward sweep (BFS) algorithm is optimized using the Manopt toolbox, yielding high accuracy and competitive computational times on 14-bus, 33-bus, and 69-bus systems when compared to established solvers. Similarly, for EPTS, MO applied via Manopt to 3-bus and 4-bus systems effectively solves power flow equations, matching traditional methods such as Newton-Raphson in performance. The study highlights that tools such as Manopt can mitigate implementation complexities, positioning MO as an efficient and accessible tool for power system analysis and potentially broader planning applications. The paper provides a comprehensive tutorial on MO, detailing its theoretical foundations, practical methodologies, and specific applications in power systems, particularly in power flow optimization.

Title: Beyond Connectivity: An Open Architecture for AI-RAN Convergence in 6G
Authors: Michele Polese, Niloofar Mohamadi, Salvatore D'Oro, Tommaso Melodia
Abstract: The proliferation of data-intensive Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications at the network edge demands a fundamental shift in RAN design, from merely consuming AI for network optimization, to actively enabling distributed AI workloads. This paradigm shift presents a significant opportunity for network operators to monetize AI at the edge while leveraging existing infrastructure investments. To realize this vision, this article presents a novel converged O-RAN and AI-RAN architecture that unifies orchestration and management of both telecommunications and AI workloads on shared infrastructure. The proposed architecture extends the Open RAN principles of modularity, disaggregation, and cloud-nativeness to support heterogeneous AI deployments. We introduce two key architectural innovations: (i) the AI-RAN Orchestrator, which extends the O-RAN Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) to enable integrated resource and allocation across RAN and AI workloads; and (ii) AI-RAN sites that provide distributed edge AI platforms with real-time processing capabilities. The proposed system supports flexible deployment options, allowing AI workloads to be orchestrated with specific timing requirements (real-time or batch processing) and geographic targeting. The proposed architecture addresses the orchestration requirements for managing heterogeneous workloads at different time scales while maintaining open, standardized interfaces and multi-vendor interoperability.

Title: Hallucinating 360°: Panoramic Street-View Generation via Local Scenes Diffusion and Probabilistic Prompting
Authors: Fei Teng, Kai Luo, Sheng Wu, Siyu Li, Pujun Guo, Jiale Wei, Kunyu Peng, Jiaming Zhang, Kailun Yang
Abstract: Panoramic perception holds significant potential for autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to acquire a comprehensive 360° surround view in a single shot. However, autonomous driving is a data-driven task. Complete panoramic data acquisition requires complex sampling systems and annotation pipelines, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although existing street view generation models have demonstrated strong data regeneration capabilities, they can only learn from the fixed data distribution of existing datasets and cannot achieve high-quality, controllable panoramic generation. In this paper, we propose the first panoramic generation method Percep360 for autonomous driving. Percep360 enables coherent generation of panoramic data with control signals based on the stitched panoramic data. Percep360 focuses on two key aspects: coherence and controllability. Specifically, to overcome the inherent information loss caused by the pinhole sampling process, we propose the Local Scenes Diffusion Method (LSDM). LSDM reformulates the panorama generation as a spatially continuous diffusion process, bridging the gaps between different data distributions. Additionally, to achieve the controllable generation of panoramic images, we propose a Probabilistic Prompting Method (PPM). PPM dynamically selects the most relevant control cues, enabling controllable panoramic image generation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the generated images from three perspectives: image quality assessment (i.e., no-reference and with reference), controllability, and their utility in real-world Bird's Eye View (BEV) segmentation. Notably, the generated data consistently outperforms the original stitched images in no-reference quality metrics and enhances downstream perception models.

Title: Optimizing Cognitive Networks: Reinforcement Learning Meets Energy Harvesting Over Cascaded Channels
Authors: Deemah H. Tashman, Soumaya Cherkaoui, Walaa Hamouda
Abstract: This paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based approach to improve the physical layer security (PLS) of an underlay cognitive radio network (CRN) over cascaded channels. These channels are utilized in highly mobile networks such as cognitive vehicular networks (CVN). In addition, an eavesdropper aims to intercept the communications between secondary users (SUs). The SU receiver has full-duplex and energy harvesting capabilities to generate jamming signals to confound the eavesdropper and enhance security. Moreover, the SU transmitter extracts energy from ambient radio frequency signals in order to power subsequent transmissions to its intended receiver. To optimize the privacy and reliability of the SUs in a CVN, a deep Q-network (DQN) strategy is utilized where multiple DQN agents are required such that an agent is assigned at each SU transmitter. The objective for the SUs is to determine the optimal transmission power and decide whether to collect energy or transmit messages during each time period in order to maximize their secrecy rate. Thereafter, we propose a DQN approach to maximize the throughput of the SUs while respecting the interference threshold acceptable at the receiver of the primary user. According to our findings, our strategy outperforms two other baseline strategies in terms of security and reliability.

Title: Maximizing Reliability in Overlay Radio Networks with Time Switching and Power Splitting Energy Harvesting
Authors: Deemah H. Tashman, Soumaya Cherkaoui, Walaa Hamouda
Abstract: Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) are acknowledged for their ability to tackle the issue of spectrum under-utilization. In the realm of CRNs, this paper investigates the energy efficiency issue and addresses the critical challenge of optimizing system reliability for overlay CRN access mode. Randomly dispersed secondary users (SUs) serving as relays for primary users (PUs) are considered, in which one of these relays is designated to harvest energy through the time switching-energy harvesting (EH) protocol. Moreover, this relay amplifies-and-forwards (AF) the PU's messages and broadcasts them along with its own across cascaded $\kappa$-$\mu$ fading channels. The power splitting protocol is another EH approach utilized by the SU and PU receivers to enhance the amount of energy in their storage devices. In addition, the SU transmitters and the SU receiver are deployed with multiple antennas for reception and apply the maximal ratio combining approach. The outage probability is utilized to assess both networks' reliability. Then, an energy efficiency evaluation is performed to determine the effectiveness of EH on the system. Finally, an optimization problem is provided with the goal of maximizing the data rate of the SUs by optimizing the time switching and the power allocation parameters of the SU relay.

Title: On-Device Training of PV Power Forecasting Models in a Smart Meter for Grid Edge Intelligence
Authors: Jian Huang, Yongli Zhu, Linna Xu, Zhe Zheng, Wenpeng Cui, Mingyang Sun
Abstract: In this paper, an edge-side model training study is conducted on a resource-limited smart meter. The motivation of grid-edge intelligence and the concept of on-device training are introduced. Then, the technical preparation steps for on-device training are described. A case study on the task of photovoltaic power forecasting is presented, where two representative machine learning models are investigated: a gradient boosting tree model and a recurrent neural network model. To adapt to the resource-limited situation in the smart meter, "mixed"- and "reduced"-precision training schemes are also devised. Experiment results demonstrate the feasibility of economically achieving grid-edge intelligence via the existing advanced metering infrastructures.

Title: Self-Supervised Learning at the Edge: The Cost of Labeling
Authors: Roberto Pereira, Fernanda Famá, Asal Rangrazi, Marco Miozzo, Charalampos Kalalas, Paolo Dini
Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has recently emerged as an alternative to traditional supervised machine learning solutions by enabling rich representations from unstructured and unlabeled data. However, CL and, more broadly, self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often demand a large amount of data and computational resources, posing challenges for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. In this work, we explore the feasibility and efficiency of SSL techniques for edge-based learning, focusing on trade-offs between model performance and energy efficiency. In particular, we analyze how different SSL techniques adapt to limited computational, data, and energy budgets, evaluating their effectiveness in learning robust representations under resource-constrained settings. Moreover, we also consider the energy costs involved in labeling data and assess how semi-supervised learning may assist in reducing the overall energy consumed to train CL models. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that tailored SSL strategies can achieve competitive performance while reducing resource consumption by up to 4X, underscoring their potential for energy-efficient learning at the edge.

Title: Advances in Intelligent Hearing Aids: Deep Learning Approaches to Selective Noise Cancellation
Authors: Haris Khan, Shumaila Asif, Hassan Nasir
Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence into hearing assistance marks a paradigm shift from traditional amplification-based systems to intelligent, context-aware audio processing. This systematic literature review evaluates advances in AI-driven selective noise cancellation (SNC) for hearing aids, highlighting technological evolution, implementation challenges, and future research directions. We synthesize findings across deep learning architectures, hardware deployment strategies, clinical validation studies, and user-centric design. The review traces progress from early machine learning models to state-of-the-art deep networks, including Convolutional Recurrent Networks for real-time inference and Transformer-based architectures for high-accuracy separation. Key findings include significant gains over traditional methods, with recent models achieving up to 18.3 dB SI-SDR improvement on noisy-reverberant benchmarks, alongside sub-10 ms real-time implementations and promising clinical outcomes. Yet, challenges remain in bridging lab-grade models with real-world deployment - particularly around power constraints, environmental variability, and personalization. Identified research gaps include hardware-software co-design, standardized evaluation protocols, and regulatory considerations for AI-enhanced hearing devices. Future work must prioritize lightweight models, continual learning, contextual-based classification and clinical translation to realize transformative hearing solutions for millions globally.

Title: A Novel Hybrid Deep Learning Technique for Speech Emotion Detection using Feature Engineering
Authors: Shahana Yasmin Chowdhury, Bithi Banik, Md Tamjidul Hoque, Shreya Banerjee
Abstract: Nowadays, speech emotion recognition (SER) plays a vital role in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) and the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI). Our proposed DCRF-BiLSTM model is used to recognize seven emotions: neutral, happy, sad, angry, fear, disgust, and surprise, which are trained on five datasets: RAVDESS (R), TESS (T), SAVEE (S), EmoDB (E), and Crema-D (C). The model achieves high accuracy on individual datasets, including 97.83% on RAVDESS, 97.02% on SAVEE, 95.10% for CREMA-D, and a perfect 100% on both TESS and EMO-DB. For the combined (R+T+S) datasets, it achieves 98.82% accuracy, outperforming previously reported results. To our knowledge, no existing study has evaluated a single SER model across all five benchmark datasets (i.e., R+T+S+C+E) simultaneously. In our work, we introduce this comprehensive combination and achieve a remarkable overall accuracy of 93.76%. These results confirm the robustness and generalizability of our DCRF-BiLSTM framework across diverse datasets.

Title: Comparative Analysis of CNN and Transformer Architectures with Heart Cycle Normalization for Automated Phonocardiogram Classification
Authors: Martin Sondermann, Pinar Bisgin, Niklas Tschorn, Anja Burmann, Christoph M. Friedrich
Abstract: The automated classification of phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings represents a substantial advancement in cardiovascular diagnostics. This paper presents a systematic comparison of four distinct models for heart murmur detection: two specialized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and two zero-shot universal audio transformers (BEATs), evaluated using fixed-length and heart cycle normalization approaches. Utilizing the PhysioNet2022 dataset, a custom heart cycle normalization method tailored to individual cardiac rhythms is introduced. The findings indicate the following AUROC values: the CNN model with fixed-length windowing achieves 79.5%, the CNN model with heart cycle normalization scores 75.4%, the BEATs transformer with fixed-length windowing achieves 65.7%, and the BEATs transformer with heart cycle normalization results in 70.1%. The findings indicate that physiological signal constraints, especially those introduced by different normalization strategies, have a substantial impact on model performance. The research provides evidence-based guidelines for architecture selection in clinical settings, emphasizing the need for a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Although specialized CNNs demonstrate superior performance overall, the zero-shot transformer models may offer promising efficiency advantages during development, such as faster training and evaluation cycles, despite their lower classification accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of automated classification systems to enhance cardiac diagnostics and improve patient care.

Title: Latent Acoustic Mapping for Direction of Arrival Estimation: A Self-Supervised Approach
Authors: Adrian S. Roman, Iran R. Roman, Juan P. Bello
Abstract: Acoustic mapping techniques have long been used in spatial audio processing for direction of arrival estimation (DoAE). Traditional beamforming methods for acoustic mapping, while interpretable, often rely on iterative solvers that can be computationally intensive and sensitive to acoustic variability. On the other hand, recent supervised deep learning approaches offer feedforward speed and robustness but require large labeled datasets and lack interpretability. Despite their strengths, both methods struggle to consistently generalize across diverse acoustic setups and array configurations, limiting their broader applicability. We introduce the Latent Acoustic Mapping (LAM) model, a self-supervised framework that bridges the interpretability of traditional methods with the adaptability and efficiency of deep learning methods. LAM generates high-resolution acoustic maps, adapts to varying acoustic conditions, and operates efficiently across different microphone arrays. We assess its robustness on DoAE using the LOCATA and STARSS benchmarks. LAM achieves comparable or superior localization performance to existing supervised methods. Additionally, we show that LAM's acoustic maps can serve as effective features for supervised models, further enhancing DoAE accuracy and underscoring its potential to advance adaptive, high-performance sound localization systems.

Title: 4KAgent: Agentic Any Image to 4K Super-Resolution
Authors: Yushen Zuo, Qi Zheng, Mingyang Wu, Xinrui Jiang, Renjie Li, Jian Wang, Yide Zhang, Gengchen Mai, Lihong V. Wang, James Zou, Xiaoyu Wang, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Zhengzhong Tu
Abstract: We present 4KAgent, a unified agentic super-resolution generalist system designed to universally upscale any image to 4K resolution (and even higher, if applied iteratively). Our system can transform images from extremely low resolutions with severe degradations, for example, highly distorted inputs at 256x256, into crystal-clear, photorealistic 4K outputs. 4KAgent comprises three core components: (1) Profiling, a module that customizes the 4KAgent pipeline based on bespoke use cases; (2) A Perception Agent, which leverages vision-language models alongside image quality assessment experts to analyze the input image and make a tailored restoration plan; and (3) A Restoration Agent, which executes the plan, following a recursive execution-reflection paradigm, guided by a quality-driven mixture-of-expert policy to select the optimal output for each step. Additionally, 4KAgent embeds a specialized face restoration pipeline, significantly enhancing facial details in portrait and selfie photos. We rigorously evaluate our 4KAgent across 11 distinct task categories encompassing a total of 26 diverse benchmarks, setting new state-of-the-art on a broad spectrum of imaging domains. Our evaluations cover natural images, portrait photos, AI-generated content, satellite imagery, fluorescence microscopy, and medical imaging like fundoscopy, ultrasound, and X-ray, demonstrating superior performance in terms of both perceptual (e.g., NIQE, MUSIQ) and fidelity (e.g., PSNR) metrics. By establishing a novel agentic paradigm for low-level vision tasks, we aim to catalyze broader interest and innovation within vision-centric autonomous agents across diverse research communities. We will release all the code, models, and results at: this https URL.

Title: The Singular Angle of Nonlinear Systems
Authors: Chao Chen, Di Zhao, Sei Zhen Khong
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an angle notion called the singular angle for nonlinear systems from an input-output perspective. The proposed system singular angle, based on the angle between $L_2$-signals, describes an upper bound for the ''rotating effect'' from system input to output signals. It quantifies passivity and serves as a counterpart to system $L_2$-gain. It also provides an alternative to a recently defined notion of system phase which adopts complexification of real-valued signals via the Hilbert transform. A nonlinear small angle theorem is established for feedback stability analysis, which involves a comparison of the loop system angle with $\pi$. The theorem generalizes the classical passivity theorem via a tradeoff between the singular angles of open-loop systems.

Title: Beampattern Design for Transmit Architectures Based on Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces
Authors: Ciro D'Elia, Emanuele Grossi, Luca Venturino
Abstract: In this work, we tackle the problem of beampattern design for a transmit system employing a large reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to redirect radio frequency signals emitted by a few active antennas (sources). We begin by establishing a convenient signal model and discussing the impact of signal bandwidth, source-RIS channel, and system geometry on our derivations. Subsequently, we propose a joint optimization of the waveform emitted by each source and the phase shifts introduced by the RIS. The objective is to match a desired space-frequency distribution of the far-field radiation pattern, relevant to both radar and communication applications. We present a sub-optimal solution to this problem, subject to a constraint on the total power radiated by the sources and, optionally, on the constant modulus of the waveforms. The provided example demonstrates the effective beampattern shaping capabilities of this RIS-based transmit architecture. Specifically, for the same array size and the same desired radiation pattern, the resulting approximation error is comparable to that obtained with a fully-digital MIMO array, especially when constant-modulus waveforms are enforced, and significantly smaller than that of a phased array.

Title: Rethinking Non-Negative Matrix Factorization with Implicit Neural Representations
Authors: Krishna Subramani, Paris Smaragdis, Takuya Higuchi, Mehrez Souden
Abstract: Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a powerful technique for analyzing regularly-sampled data, i.e., data that can be stored in a matrix. For audio, this has led to numerous applications using time-frequency (TF) representations like the Short-Time Fourier Transform. However extending these applications to irregularly-spaced TF representations, like the Constant-Q transform, wavelets, or sinusoidal analysis models, has not been possible since these representations cannot be directly stored in matrix form. In this paper, we formulate NMF in terms of learnable functions (instead of vectors) and show that NMF can be extended to a wider variety of signal classes that need not be regularly sampled.

Title: Mask-Guided Attention U-Net for Enhanced Neonatal Brain Extraction and Image Preprocessing
Authors: Bahram Jafrasteh, Simon Pedro Lubian-Lopez, Emiliano Trimarco, Macarena Roman Ruiz, Carmen Rodriguez Barrios, Yolanda Marin Almagro, Isabel Benavente-Fernandez
Abstract: In this study, we introduce MGA-Net, a novel mask-guided attention neural network, which extends the U-net model for precision neonatal brain imaging. MGA-Net is designed to extract the brain from other structures and reconstruct high-quality brain images. The network employs a common encoder and two decoders: one for brain mask extraction and the other for brain region reconstruction. A key feature of MGA-Net is its high-level mask-guided attention module, which leverages features from the brain mask decoder to enhance image reconstruction. To enable the same encoder and decoder to process both MRI and ultrasound (US) images, MGA-Net integrates sinusoidal positional encoding. This encoding assigns distinct positional values to MRI and US images, allowing the model to effectively learn from both modalities. Consequently, features learned from a single modality can aid in learning a modality with less available data, such as US. We extensively validated the proposed MGA-Net on diverse datasets from varied clinical settings and neonatal age groups. The metrics used for assessment included the DICE similarity coefficient, recall, and accuracy for image segmentation; structural similarity for image reconstruction; and root mean squared error for total brain volume estimation from 3D ultrasound images. Our results demonstrate that MGA-Net significantly outperforms traditional methods, offering superior performance in brain extraction and segmentation while achieving high precision in image reconstruction and volumetric analysis. Thus, MGA-Net represents a robust and effective preprocessing tool for MRI and 3D ultrasound images, marking a significant advance in neuroimaging that enhances both research and clinical diagnostics in the neonatal period and beyond.

Title: UWarp: A Whole Slide Image Registration Pipeline to Characterize Scanner-Induced Local Domain Shift

Abstract: Histopathology slide digitization introduces scanner-induced domain shift that can significantly impact computational pathology models based on deep learning methods. In the state-of-the-art, this shift is often characterized at a broad scale (slide-level or dataset-level) but not patch-level, which limits our comprehension of the impact of localized tissue characteristics on the accuracy of the deep learning models. To address this challenge, we present a domain shift analysis framework based on UWarp, a novel registration tool designed to accurately align histological slides scanned under varying conditions. UWarp employs a hierarchical registration approach, combining global affine transformations with fine-grained local corrections to achieve robust tissue patch alignment. We evaluate UWarp using two private datasets, CypathLung and BosomShieldBreast, containing whole slide images scanned by multiple devices. Our experiments demonstrate that UWarp outperforms existing open-source registration methods, achieving a median target registration error (TRE) of less than 4 pixels (<1 micrometer at 40x magnification) while significantly reducing computational time. Additionally, we apply UWarp to characterize scanner-induced local domain shift in the predictions of Breast-NEOprAIdict, a deep learning model for breast cancer pathological response prediction. We find that prediction variability is strongly correlated with tissue density on a given patch. Our findings highlight the importance of localized domain shift analysis and suggest that UWarp can serve as a valuable tool for improving model robustness and domain adaptation strategies in computational pathology.

Title: Path-following model predictive control for autonomous e-scooters
Authors: David Meister, Robin Strässer, Felix Brändle, Marc Seidel, Benno Bassler, Nathan Gerber, Jan Kautz, Elena Rommel, Frank Allgöwer
Abstract: In order to mitigate economical, ecological, and societal challenges in electric scooter (e-scooter) sharing systems, we develop an autonomous e-scooter prototype. Our vision is to design a fully autonomous prototype that can find its way to the next parking spot, high-demand area, or charging station. In this work, we propose a path-following model predictive control solution to enable localization and navigation in an urban environment with a provided path to follow. We design a closed-loop architecture that solves the localization and path following problem while allowing the e-scooter to maintain its balance with a previously developed reaction wheel mechanism. Our model predictive control approach facilitates state and input constraints, e.g., adhering to the path width, while remaining executable on a Raspberry Pi 5. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in a real-world experiment on our prototype.

Title: CFARNet: Learning-Based High-Resolution Multi-Target Detection for Rainbow Beam Radar
Authors: Qiushi Liang, Yeyue Cai, Jianhua Mo, Meixia Tao
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) OFDM radar equipped with rainbow beamforming, enabled by phase-time arrays (PTAs), provides wide-angle coverage and is well-suited for fast real-time target detection and tracking. However, accurate detection of multiple closely spaced targets remains a key challenge for conventional signal processing pipelines, particularly those relying on constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detectors. This paper presents CFARNet, a learning-based processing framework that replaces CFAR with a convolutional neural network (CNN) for peak detection in the angle-Doppler domain. The network predicts target subcarrier indices, which guide angle estimation via a known frequency-angle mapping and enable high-resolution range and velocity estimation using the MUSIC algorithm. Extensive simulations demonstrate that CFARNet significantly outperforms a baseline combining CFAR and MUSIC, especially under low transmit power and dense multi-target conditions. The proposed method offers superior angular resolution, enhanced robustness in low-SNR scenarios, and improved computational efficiency, highlighting the potential of data-driven approaches for high-resolution mmWave radar sensing.

Title: A Direct Comparison of Simultaneously Recorded Scalp, Around-Ear, and In-Ear EEG for Neural Selective Auditory Attention Decoding to Speech
Authors: Simon Geirnaert, Simon L. Kappel, Preben Kidmose
Abstract: Current assistive hearing devices, such as hearing aids and cochlear implants, lack the ability to adapt to the listener's focus of auditory attention, limiting their effectiveness in complex acoustic environments like cocktail party scenarios where multiple conversations occur simultaneously. Neuro-steered hearing devices aim to overcome this limitation by decoding the listener's auditory attention from neural signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG). While many auditory attention decoding (AAD) studies have used high-density scalp EEG, such systems are impractical for daily use as they are bulky and uncomfortable. Therefore, AAD with wearable and unobtrusive EEG systems that are comfortable to wear and can be used for long-term recording are required. Around-ear EEG systems like cEEGrids have shown promise in AAD, but in-ear EEG, recorded via custom earpieces offering superior comfort, remains underexplored. We present a new AAD dataset with simultaneously recorded scalp, around-ear, and in-ear EEG, enabling a direct comparison. Using a classic linear stimulus reconstruction algorithm, a significant performance gap between all three systems exists, with AAD accuracies of 83.4% (scalp), 67.2% (around-ear), and 61.1% (in-ear) on 60s decision windows. These results highlight the trade-off between decoding performance and practical usability. Yet, while the ear-based systems using basic algorithms might currently not yield accurate enough performances for a decision speed-sensitive application in hearing aids, their significant performance suggests potential for attention monitoring on longer timescales. Furthermore, adding an external reference or a few scalp electrodes via greedy forward selection substantially and quickly boosts accuracy by over 10 percent point, especially for in-ear EEG. These findings position in-ear EEG as a promising component in EEG sensor networks for AAD.

Title: Robust Longitudinal-lateral Look-ahead Pursuit Path-Following Control: Fast Finite-Time Stability Guarantee
Authors: Zimao Sheng, Hong'an Yang, Shuxiang Yang, Zirui Yu
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenging problem of robust path-following for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in complex environments with bounded external disturbances and non-smooth predefined paths. Due to the unique aerodynamic characteristics and flight constraints of fixed-wing UAVs, achieving accurate and fast stable path following remains difficult, especially in low-altitude mountainous terrains, urban landscapes, and under wind disturbances. Most existing path-following guidance laws often struggle to ensure fast stabilization under unknown bounded disturbances while maintaining sufficient robustness, and there is a lack of research on optimizing robustness for non-smooth paths under flight constraints. This paper addresses these issues by proposing a constraints-based robust path-following controller. Firstly, from the perspective of global random attractor, we innovatively introduce robustness metrics that quantify both the exponential convergence rate and the range of the ultimate attractor set. Secondly, building on these metrics, we develop a robust longitudinal-lateral look-ahead pursuit (RLLP) guidance law for fixed-wing UAVs, specifically considering the flight path angle and track angle under external disturbances. Thirdly, we also derive an optimized version (Optimal-RLLP) to enhance the robustness metrics, and elaborate on the sufficient conditions for fast finite-time stability, ensuring the guidance law achieves finite-time stability and robustness with reduced sensitivity to constrained uncertainties. The simulation results validate the proposed guidance law's feasibility, optimality and robustness under atmospheric disturbances using a high-fidelity simulation platform and provide key principle for practical deployment.

Title: Single Snapshot Distillation for Phase Coded Mask Design in Phase Retrieval
Authors: Karen Fonseca, Leon Suarez-Rodriguez, Andres Jerez, Felipe Gutierrez-Barragan, Henry Arguello
Abstract: Phase retrieval (PR) reconstructs phase information from magnitude measurements, known as coded diffraction patterns (CDPs), whose quality depends on the number of snapshots captured using coded phase masks. High-quality phase estimation requires multiple snapshots, which is not desired for efficient PR systems. End-to-end frameworks enable joint optimization of the optical system and the recovery neural network. However, their application is constrained by physical implementation limitations. Additionally, the framework is prone to gradient vanishing issues related to its global optimization process. This paper introduces a Knowledge Distillation (KD) optimization approach to address these limitations. KD transfers knowledge from a larger, lower-constrained network (teacher) to a smaller, more efficient, and implementable network (student). In this method, the teacher, a PR system trained with multiple snapshots, distills its knowledge into a single-snapshot PR system, the student. The loss functions compare the CPMs and the feature space of the recovery network. Simulations demonstrate that this approach improves reconstruction performance compared to a PR system trained without the teacher's guidance.

Title: QoS-aware State-Augmented Learnable Algorithm for Wireless Coexistence Parameter Management
Authors: Mohammad Reza Fasihi, Brian L. Mark
Abstract: Efficient and fair coexistence in unlicensed spectrum is essential to support heterogeneous networks such as 5G NR-U and Wi-Fi, which often contend for shared wireless resources. We introduce a general framework for wireless Coexistence Parameter Management (CPM) based on state-augmented constrained reinforcement learning. We propose a novel algorithm, QaSAL-CPM, which incorporates state-augmentation by embedding the dual variables in the constrained optimization formulation directly into the agent's observation space. This method enables the agent to respond to constraint violations in real time while continuing to optimize a primary performance objective. Through extensive simulations of 5G NR-U and Wi-Fi coexistence scenarios, we show that QaSAL-CPM achieves reliable QoS compliance and improved policy robustness across various transmitter densities compared to previous approaches. The proposed framework offers a scalable and adaptive solution for real-time coexistence optimization in next-generation wireless networks.

Title: Federated Breast Cancer Detection Enhanced by Synthetic Ultrasound Image Augmentation
Authors: Hongyi Pan, Ziliang Hong, Gorkem Durak, Ziyue Xu, Ulas Bagci
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaboratively training deep learning models across institutions without exchanging sensitive medical data. However, its effectiveness is often hindered by limited data availability and non-independent, identically distributed data across participating clients, which can degrade model performance and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a generative AI based data augmentation framework that integrates synthetic image sharing into the federated training process for breast cancer diagnosis via ultrasound images. Specifically, we train two simple class-specific Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks: one for benign and one for malignant lesions. We then simulate a realistic FL setting using three publicly available breast ultrasound image datasets: BUSI, BUS-BRA, and UDIAT. FedAvg and FedProx are adopted as baseline FL algorithms. Experimental results show that incorporating a suitable number of synthetic images improved the average AUC from 0.9206 to 0.9237 for FedAvg and from 0.9429 to 0.9538 for FedProx. We also note that excessive use of synthetic data reduced performance, underscoring the importance of maintaining a balanced ratio of real and synthetic samples. Our findings highlight the potential of generative AI based data augmentation to enhance FL results in the breast ultrasound image classification task.

Title: Medical Image Segmentation Using Advanced Unet: VMSE-Unet and VM-Unet CBAM+
Authors: Sayandeep Kanrar, Raja Piyush, Qaiser Razi, Debanshi Chakraborty, Vikas Hassija, GSS Chalapathi
Abstract: In this paper, we present the VMSE U-Net and VM-Unet CBAM+ model, two cutting-edge deep learning architectures designed to enhance medical image segmentation. Our approach integrates Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) and Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) techniques into the traditional VM U-Net framework, significantly improving segmentation accuracy, feature localization, and computational efficiency. Both models show superior performance compared to the baseline VM-Unet across multiple datasets. Notably, VMSEUnet achieves the highest accuracy, IoU, precision, and recall while maintaining low loss values. It also exhibits exceptional computational efficiency with faster inference times and lower memory usage on both GPU and CPU. Overall, the study suggests that the enhanced architecture VMSE-Unet is a valuable tool for medical image analysis. These findings highlight its potential for real-world clinical applications, emphasizing the importance of further research to optimize accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.

Title: Sequential Attention-based Sampling for Histopathological Analysis
Authors: Tarun G, Naman Malpani, Gugan Thoppe, Sridharan Devarajan
Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly applied for automated histopathology. Yet, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often acquired at gigapixel sizes, rendering it computationally infeasible to analyze them entirely at high resolution. Diagnostic labels are largely available only at the slide-level, because expert annotation of images at a finer (patch) level is both laborious and expensive. Moreover, regions with diagnostic information typically occupy only a small fraction of the WSI, making it inefficient to examine the entire slide at full resolution. Here, we propose SASHA -- {\it S}equential {\it A}ttention-based {\it S}ampling for {\it H}istopathological {\it A}nalysis -- a deep reinforcement learning approach for efficient analysis of histopathological images. First, SASHA learns informative features with a lightweight hierarchical, attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) model. Second, SASHA samples intelligently and zooms selectively into a small fraction (10-20\%) of high-resolution patches, to achieve reliable diagnosis. We show that SASHA matches state-of-the-art methods that analyze the WSI fully at high-resolution, albeit at a fraction of their computational and memory costs. In addition, it significantly outperforms competing, sparse sampling methods. We propose SASHA as an intelligent sampling model for medical imaging challenges that involve automated diagnosis with exceptionally large images containing sparsely informative features.

Title: ADPv2: A Hierarchical Histological Tissue Type-Annotated Dataset for Potential Biomarker Discovery of Colorectal Disease
Authors: Zhiyuan Yang, Kai Li, Sophia Ghamoshi Ramandi, Patricia Brassard, Hakim Khellaf, Vincent Quoc-Huy Trinh, Jennifer Zhang, Lina Chen, Corwyn Rowsell, Sonal Varma, Kostas Plataniotis, Mahdi S. Hosseini
Abstract: Computational pathology (CoPath) leverages histopathology images to enhance diagnostic precision and reproducibility in clinical pathology. However, publicly available datasets for CoPath that are annotated with extensive histological tissue type (HTT) taxonomies at a granular level remain scarce due to the significant expertise and high annotation costs required. Existing datasets, such as the Atlas of Digital Pathology (ADP), address this by offering diverse HTT annotations generalized to multiple organs, but limit the capability for in-depth studies on specific organ diseases. Building upon this foundation, we introduce ADPv2, a novel dataset focused on gastrointestinal histopathology. Our dataset comprises 20,004 image patches derived from healthy colon biopsy slides, annotated according to a hierarchical taxonomy of 32 distinct HTTs of 3 levels. Furthermore, we train a multilabel representation learning model following a two-stage training procedure on our ADPv2 dataset. We leverage the VMamba architecture and achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.88 in multilabel classification of colon HTTs. Finally, we show that our dataset is capable of an organ-specific in-depth study for potential biomarker discovery by analyzing the model's prediction behavior on tissues affected by different colon diseases, which reveals statistical patterns that confirm the two pathological pathways of colon cancer development. Our dataset is publicly available at this https URL

Title: Sparsity-Promoting Dynamic Mode Decomposition Applied to Sea Surface Temperature Fields
Authors: Zhicheng Zhang, Yoshihiko Susuki, Atsushi Okazaki
Abstract: In this paper, we leverage Koopman mode decomposition to analyze the nonlinear and high-dimensional climate systems acting on the observed data space. The dynamics of atmospheric systems are assumed to be equation-free, with the linear evolution of observables derived from measured historical long-term time-series data snapshots, such as monthly sea surface temperature records, to construct a purely data-driven climate dynamics. In particular, sparsity-promoting dynamic mode decomposition is exploited to extract the dominant spatial and temporal modes, which are among the most significant coherent structures underlying climate variability, enabling a more efficient, interpretable, and low-dimensional representation of the system dynamics. We hope that the combined use of Koopman modes and sparsity-promoting techniques will provide insights into the significant climate modes, enabling reduced-order modeling of the climate system and offering a potential framework for predicting and controlling weather and climate variability.

Title: Tissue Concepts v2: A Supervised Foundation Model For Whole Slide Images
Authors: Till Nicke, Daniela Schacherer, Jan Raphael Schäfer, Natalia Artysh, Antje Prasse, André Homeyer, Andrea Schenk, Henning Höfener, Johannes Lotz
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are transforming the field of computational pathology by offering new approaches to analyzing histopathology images. Typically relying on weeks of training on large databases, the creation of FMs is a resource-intensive process in many ways. In this paper, we introduce the extension of our supervised foundation model, Tissue Concepts, to whole slide images, called Tissue Concepts v2 (TCv2), a supervised foundation model for whole slide images to address the issue above. TCv2 uses supervised, end-to-end multitask learning on slide-level labels. Training TCv2 uses a fraction of the training resources compared to self-supervised training. The presented model shows superior performance compared to SSL-trained models in cancer subtyping benchmarks and is fully trained on freely available data. Furthermore, a shared trained attention module provides an additional layer of explainability across different tasks.

Title: Self-Calibrated Variance-Stabilizing Transformations for Real-World Image Denoising
Authors: Sébastien Herbreteau, Michael Unser
Abstract: Supervised deep learning has become the method of choice for image denoising. It involves the training of neural networks on large datasets composed of pairs of noisy and clean images. However, the necessity of training data that are specific to the targeted application constrains the widespread use of denoising networks. Recently, several approaches have been developed to overcome this difficulty by whether artificially generating realistic clean/noisy image pairs, or training exclusively on noisy images. In this paper, we show that, contrary to popular belief, denoising networks specialized in the removal of Gaussian noise can be efficiently leveraged in favor of real-world image denoising, even without additional training. For this to happen, an appropriate variance-stabilizing transform (VST) has to be applied beforehand. We propose an algorithm termed Noise2VST for the learning of such a model-free VST. Our approach requires only the input noisy image and an off-the-shelf Gaussian denoiser. We demonstrate through extensive experiments the efficiency and superiority of Noise2VST in comparison to existing methods trained in the absence of specific clean/noisy pairs.

Title: Distributionally Robust Joint Chance-Constrained Optimization for Electricity Imbalance: Integrating Renewables and Storage
Authors: Amir Noori, Babak Tavassoli, Alireza Fereidunian
Abstract: Integrating Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) with peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading offers promising solutions for grid modernization by incentivizing prosumers to participate in mitigating peak demand. However, this integration also introduces operational uncertainties and computational challenges. This paper aims to address these challenges with a novel scalable and tractable distributionally robust joint chance-constrained (DRJCC) optimization framework that effectively facilitates P2P energy trading by enhancing flexibility provision from large-scale DER operations under uncertain supply and demand. Therefore, a practical framework is proposed to solve the core challenges of DRJCC by integrating three key components: (1) a Wasserstein ambiguity set that effectively quantifies uncertainty with sparse data, (2) a CVaR-based approximation of joint chance constraints to balance computational efficiency with risk control, and (3) a privacy-preserving ADMM algorithm that enables distributed implementation through decomposition. To discern patterns in the data that indicate collaboration potential and adjust ambiguity sets for improved efficiency, K-means clustering is applied to historical scenarios. Simulation results show that the proposed framework reduces peak demand by approximately 28% and total community costs by around 31%, underscoring its effectiveness in enhancing grid robustness, operational reliability, and economic optimization in renewable-based energy management.

Title: Disentangling Uncertainty for Safe Social Navigation using Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Daniel Flögel, Marcos Gómez Villafañe, Joshua Ransiek, Sören Hohmann
Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots are increasingly used in pedestrian-rich environments where safe navigation and appropriate human interaction are crucial. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) enables socially integrated robot behavior, challenges persist in novel or perturbed scenarios to indicate when and why the policy is uncertain. Unknown uncertainty in decision-making can lead to collisions or human discomfort and is one reason why safe and risk-aware navigation is still an open problem. This work introduces a novel approach that integrates aleatoric, epistemic, and predictive uncertainty estimation into a DRL navigation framework for policy distribution uncertainty estimates. We, therefore, incorporate Observation-Dependent Variance (ODV) and dropout into the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. For different types of perturbations, we compare the ability of deep ensembles and Monte-Carlo dropout (MC-dropout) to estimate the uncertainties of the policy. In uncertain decision-making situations, we propose to change the robot's social behavior to conservative collision avoidance. The results show improved training performance with ODV and dropout in PPO and reveal that the training scenario has an impact on the generalization. In addition, MC-dropout is more sensitive to perturbations and correlates the uncertainty type to the perturbation better. With the safe action selection, the robot can navigate in perturbed environments with fewer collisions.

Title: A Voice-based Triage for Type 2 Diabetes using a Conversational Virtual Assistant in the Home Environment
Authors: Kelvin Summoogum, Debayan Das, Sathish Kumaran
Abstract: Incorporating cloud technology with Internet of Medical Things for ubiquitous healthcare has seen many successful applications in the last decade with the advent of machine learning and deep learning techniques. One of these applications, namely voice-based pathology, has yet to receive notable attention from academia and industry. Applying voice analysis to early detection of fatal diseases holds much promise to improve health outcomes and quality of life of patients. In this paper, we propose a novel application of acoustic machine learning based triaging into commoditised conversational virtual assistant systems to pre-screen for onset of diabetes. Specifically, we developed a triaging system which extracts acoustic features from the voices of n=24 older adults when they converse with a virtual assistant and predict the incidence of Diabetes Mellitus (Type 2) or not. Our triaging system achieved hit-rates of 70% and 60% for male and female older adult subjects, respectively. Our proposed triaging uses 7 non-identifiable voice-based features and can operate within resource-constrained embedded systems running voice-based virtual assistants. This application demonstrates the feasibility of applying voice-based pathology analysis to improve health outcomes of older adults within the home environment by early detection of life-changing chronic conditions like diabetes.

Title: XY-Tokenizer: Mitigating the Semantic-Acoustic Conflict in Low-Bitrate Speech Codecs
Authors: Yitian Gong, Luozhijie Jin, Ruifan Deng, Dong Zhang, Xin Zhang, Qinyuan Cheng, Zhaoye Fei, Shimin Li, Xipeng Qiu
Abstract: Speech codecs serve as bridges between speech signals and large language models. An ideal codec for speech language models should not only preserve acoustic information but also capture rich semantic information. However, existing speech codecs struggle to balance high-quality audio reconstruction with ease of modeling by language models. In this study, we analyze the limitations of previous codecs in balancing semantic richness and acoustic fidelity. We propose XY-Tokenizer, a novel codec that mitigates the conflict between semantic and acoustic capabilities through multi-stage, multi-task learning. Experimental results demonstrate that XY-Tokenizer achieves performance in both semantic and acoustic tasks comparable to that of state-of-the-art codecs operating at similar bitrates, even though those existing codecs typically excel in only one aspect. Specifically, XY-Tokenizer achieves strong text alignment, surpassing distillation-based semantic modeling methods such as SpeechTokenizer and Mimi, while maintaining a speaker similarity score of 0.83 between reconstructed and original audio. The reconstruction performance of XY-Tokenizer is comparable to that of BigCodec, the current state-of-the-art among acoustic-only codecs, which achieves a speaker similarity score of 0.84 at a similar bitrate.

Title: Experimental Multiport-Network Parameter Estimation and Optimization for Multi-Bit RIS
Authors: Philipp del Hougne
Abstract: Physics-consistent theoretical studies on RIS-parametrized wireless channels use models from multiport-network theory (MNT) to capture mutual-coupling (MC) effects. However, in practice, RIS design and radio environment are partially or completely unknown. We fill a research gap on how to estimate the MNT model parameters in such experimentally relevant scenarios. Our technique efficiently combines closed-form and gradient-descent steps, and it can be applied to multi-bit-programmable RIS elements. We discuss inevitable (but operationally irrelevant) parameter ambiguities. We experimentally validate our technique in an unknown rich-scattering environment parametrized by eight 6-bit-programmable RIS elements of unknown design. We experimentally evaluate the performance of RIS configurations optimized with the estimated MNT model and an MC-unaware cascaded model. While the models differ in accuracy by up to 17 dB, the end-to-end performance differences are small.

Title: Mutual Information Bounds for Lossy Common Information
Authors: Anderson de Andrade
Abstract: We show the mutual information between the targets in a Gray-Wyner Network as a bound that separates Wyner's lossy common information and Gács-Körner lossy common information. The results are a generalization of the lossless case presented by Wyner (1975).
