Title: An Artificial Intelligence Model for Early Stage Breast Cancer Detection from Biopsy Images
Authors: Neil Chaudhary, Zaynah Dhunny
Abstract: Accurate identification of breast cancer types plays a critical role in guiding treatment decisions and improving patient outcomes. This paper presents an artificial intelligence enabled tool designed to aid in the identification of breast cancer types using histopathological biopsy images. Traditionally additional tests have to be done on women who are detected with breast cancer to find out the types of cancer it is to give the necessary cure. Those tests are not only invasive but also delay the initiation of treatment and increase patient burden. The proposed model utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to distinguish between benign and malignant tissues as well as accurate subclassification of breast cancer types. By preprocessing the images to reduce noise and enhance features, the model achieves reliable levels of classification performance. Experimental results on such datasets demonstrate the model's effectiveness, outperforming several existing solutions in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The study emphasizes the potential of deep learning techniques in clinical diagnostics and offers a promising tool to assist pathologists in breast cancer classification.

Title: Towards Emotionally Consistent Text-Based Speech Editing: Introducing EmoCorrector and The ECD-TSE Dataset
Authors: Rui Liu, Pu Gao, Jiatian Xi, Berrak Sisman, Carlos Busso, Haizhou Li
Abstract: Text-based speech editing (TSE) modifies speech using only text, eliminating re-recording. However, existing TSE methods, mainly focus on the content accuracy and acoustic consistency of synthetic speech segments, and often overlook the emotional shifts or inconsistency issues introduced by text changes. To address this issue, we propose EmoCorrector, a novel post-correction scheme for TSE. EmoCorrector leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by extracting the edited text's emotional features, retrieving speech samples with matching emotions, and synthesizing speech that aligns with the desired emotion while preserving the speaker's identity and quality. To support the training and evaluation of emotional consistency modeling in TSE, we pioneer the benchmarking Emotion Correction Dataset for TSE (ECD-TSE). The prominent aspect of ECD-TSE is its inclusion of $<$text, speech$>$ paired data featuring diverse text variations and a range of emotional expressions. Subjective and objective experiments and comprehensive analysis on ECD-TSE confirm that EmoCorrector significantly enhances the expression of intended emotion while addressing emotion inconsistency limitations in current TSE methods.

Title: DiffNMR: Advancing Inpainting of Randomly Sampled Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Signals
Authors: Sen Yan, Fabrizio Gabellieri, Etienne Goffinet, Filippo Castiglione, Thomas Launey
Abstract: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy leverages nuclear magnetization to probe molecules' chemical environment, structure, and dynamics, with applications spanning from pharmaceuticals to the petroleum industry. Despite its utility, the high cost of NMR instrumentation, operation and the lengthy duration of experiments necessitate the development of computational techniques to optimize acquisition times. Non-Uniform sampling (NUS) is widely employed as a sub-sampling method to address these challenges, but it often introduces artifacts and degrades spectral quality, offsetting the benefits of reduced acquisition times. In this work, we propose the use of deep learning techniques to enhance the reconstruction quality of NUS spectra. Specifically, we explore the application of diffusion models, a relatively untapped approach in this domain. Our methodology involves applying diffusion models to both time-time and time-frequency NUS data, yielding satisfactory reconstructions of challenging spectra from the benchmark Artina dataset. This approach demonstrates the potential of diffusion models to improve the efficiency and accuracy of NMR spectroscopy as well as the superiority of using a time-frequency domain data over the time-time one, opening new landscapes for future studies.

Title: Learning mechanical systems from real-world data using discrete forced Lagrangian dynamics
Authors: Martine Dyring Hansen, Elena Celledoni, Benjamin Kwanen Tampley
Abstract: We introduce a data-driven method for learning the equations of motion of mechanical systems directly from position measurements, without requiring access to velocity data. This is particularly relevant in system identification tasks where only positional information is available, such as motion capture, pixel data or low-resolution tracking. Our approach takes advantage of the discrete Lagrange-d'Alembert principle and the forced discrete Euler-Lagrange equations to construct a physically grounded model of the system's dynamics. We decompose the dynamics into conservative and non-conservative components, which are learned separately using feed-forward neural networks. In the absence of external forces, our method reduces to a variational discretization of the action principle naturally preserving the symplectic structure of the underlying Hamiltonian system. We validate our approach on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to baseline methods. In particular, we apply our model to (1) measured human motion data and (2) latent embeddings obtained via an autoencoder trained on image sequences. We demonstrate that we can faithfully reconstruct and separate both the conservative and forced dynamics, yielding interpretable and physically consistent predictions.

Title: Algorithmic Control Improves Residential Building Energy and EV Management when PV Capacity is High but Battery Capacity is Low
Authors: Lennart Ullner, Alona Zharova, Felix Creutzig
Abstract: Efficient energy management in prosumer households is key to alleviating grid stress in an energy transition marked by electric vehicles (EV), renewable energies and battery storage. However, it is unclear how households optimize prosumer EV charging. Here we study real-world data from 90 households on fixed-rate electricity tariffs in German-speaking countries to investigate the potential of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and other control approaches (Rule-Based, Model Predictive Control) to manage the dynamic and uncertain environment of Home Energy Management (HEM) and optimize household charging patterns. The DRL agent efficiently aligns charging of EV and battery storage with photovoltaic (PV) surplus. We find that frequent EV charging transactions, early EV connections and PV surplus increase optimization potential. A detailed analysis of nine households (1 hour resolution, 1 year) demonstrates that high battery capacity facilitates self optimization; in this case further algorithmic control shows little value. In cases with relatively low battery capacity, algorithmic control with DRL improves energy management and cost savings by a relevant margin. This result is further corroborated by our simulation of a synthetic household. We conclude that prosumer households with optimization potential would profit from DRL, thus benefiting also the full electricity system and its decarbonization.

Title: Federated Learning-Distillation Alternation for Resource-Constrained IoT
Authors: Rafael Valente da Silva, Onel L. Alcaraz López, Richard Demo Souza
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces significant challenges in Internet of Things (IoT) networks due to device limitations in energy and communication resources, especially when considering the large size of FL models. From an energy perspective, the challenge is aggravated if devices rely on energy harvesting (EH), as energy availability can vary significantly over time, influencing the average number of participating users in each iteration. Additionally, the transmission of large model updates is more susceptible to interference from uncorrelated background traffic in shared wireless environments. As an alternative, federated distillation (FD) reduces communication overhead and energy consumption by transmitting local model outputs, which are typically much smaller than the entire model used in FL. However, this comes at the cost of reduced model accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we propose FL-distillation alternation (FLDA). In FLDA, devices alternate between FD and FL phases, balancing model information with lower communication overhead and energy consumption per iteration. We consider a multichannel slotted-ALOHA EH-IoT network subject to background traffic/interference. In such a scenario, FLDA demonstrates higher model accuracy than both FL and FD, and achieves faster convergence than FL. Moreover, FLDA achieves target accuracies saving up to 98% in energy consumption, while also being less sensitive to interference, both relative to FL.

Title: Robust fine-tuning of speech recognition models via model merging: application to disordered speech
Authors: Alexandre Ducorroy, Rachid Riad
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has advanced with Speech Foundation Models (SFMs), yet performance degrades on dysarthric speech due to variability and limited data. This study as part of the submission to the Speech Accessibility challenge, explored model merging to improve ASR generalization using Whisper as the base SFM. We compared fine-tuning with single-trajectory merging, combining models from one fine-tuning path, and multi-run merging, merging independently trained models. Our best multi-run merging approach achieved a 12% relative decrease of WER over classic fine-tuning, and a 16.2% relative decrease on long-form audios, a major loss contributor in dysarthric ASR. Merging more and more models led to continuous gains, remained effective in low-data regimes, and generalized across model architectures. These results highlight model merging as an easily replicable adaptation method that consistently improves ASR without additional inference cost or hyperparameter tuning.

Title: BrainStratify: Coarse-to-Fine Disentanglement of Intracranial Neural Dynamics
Authors: Hui Zheng, Hai-Teng Wang, Yi-Tao Jing, Pei-Yang Lin, Han-Qing Zhao, Wei Chen, Peng-Hu Wei, Yong-Zhi Shan, Guo-Guang Zhao, Yun-Zhe Liu
Abstract: Decoding speech directly from neural activity is a central goal in brain-computer interface (BCI) research. In recent years, exciting advances have been made through the growing use of intracranial field potential recordings, such as stereo-ElectroEncephaloGraphy (sEEG) and ElectroCorticoGraphy (ECoG). These neural signals capture rich population-level activity but present key challenges: (i) task-relevant neural signals are sparsely distributed across sEEG electrodes, and (ii) they are often entangled with task-irrelevant neural signals in both sEEG and ECoG. To address these challenges, we introduce a unified Coarse-to-Fine neural disentanglement framework, BrainStratify, which includes (i) identifying functional groups through spatial-context-guided temporal-spatial modeling, and (ii) disentangling distinct neural dynamics within the target functional group using Decoupled Product Quantization (DPQ). We evaluate BrainStratify on two open-source sEEG datasets and one (epidural) ECoG dataset, spanning tasks like vocal production and speech perception. Extensive experiments show that BrainStratify, as a unified framework for decoding speech from intracranial neural signals, significantly outperforms previous decoding methods. Overall, by combining data-driven stratification with neuroscience-inspired modularity, BrainStratify offers a robust and interpretable solution for speech decoding from intracranial recordings.

Title: CardioPatternFormer: Pattern-Guided Attention for Interpretable ECG Classification with Transformer Architecture
Authors: Berat Kutay Uğraş, Ömer Nezih Gerek, İbrahim Talha Saygı
Abstract: Accurate ECG interpretation is vital, yet complex cardiac data and "black-box" AI models limit clinical utility. Inspired by Transformer architectures' success in NLP for understanding sequential data, we frame ECG as the heart's unique "language" of temporal patterns. We present CardioPatternFormer, a novel Transformer-based model for interpretable ECG classification. It employs a sophisticated attention mechanism to precisely identify and classify diverse cardiac patterns, excelling at discerning subtle anomalies and distinguishing multiple co-occurring conditions. This pattern-guided attention provides clear insights by highlighting influential signal regions, effectively allowing the "heart to talk" through transparent interpretations. CardioPatternFormer demonstrates robust performance on challenging ECGs, including complex multi-pathology cases. Its interpretability via attention maps enables clinicians to understand the model's rationale, fostering trust and aiding informed diagnostic decisions. This work offers a powerful, transparent solution for advanced ECG analysis, paving the way for more reliable and clinically actionable AI in cardiology.

Title: In-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models to detect suicide risk among adolescents from speech transcripts
Authors: Filomene Roquefort, Alexandre Ducorroy, Rachid Riad
Abstract: Early suicide risk detection in adolescents is critical yet hindered by scalability challenges of current assessments. This paper presents our approach to the first SpeechWellness Challenge (SW1), which aims to assess suicide risk in Chinese adolescents through speech analysis. Due to speech anonymization constraints, we focused on linguistic features, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for transcript-based classification. Using DSPy for systematic prompt engineering, we developed a robust in-context learning approach that outperformed traditional fine-tuning on both linguistic and acoustic markers. Our systems achieved third and fourth places among 180+ submissions, with 0.68 accuracy (F1=0.7) using only transcripts. Ablation analyses showed that increasing prompt example improved performance (p=0.003), with varying effects across model types and sizes. These findings advance automated suicide risk assessment and demonstrate LLMs' value in mental health applications.

Authors: Tony Kim, Haotian Liu, Chiung-Ting Huang, Ingrid Wu, Xilin Liu
Abstract: Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive, real-time method for monitoring brain activity by measuring hemodynamic responses in the cerebral cortex. However, existing systems are expensive, bulky, and limited to clinical or research environments. This paper introduces OpenNIRScap, an open-source, low-cost, and wearable fNIRS system designed to make real-time brain monitoring more accessible in everyday environments. The device features 24 custom-designed sensor boards with dual-wavelength light emitters and photodiode detectors, a central electrical control unit (ECU) with analog multiplexing, and a real-time data processing pipeline. Bench validation and pilot tests on volunteers have confirmed the ability of the system to capture cognitively evoked hemodynamic responses, supporting its potential as an affordable tool for cognitive monitoring and portable neurotechnology applications. The hardware, software, and graphical user interface have all been open-sourced and made publicly available at the following link: this https URL.

Title: ReverbFX: A Dataset of Room Impulse Responses Derived from Reverb Effect Plugins for Singing Voice Dereverberation
Authors: Julius Richter, Till Svajda, Timo Gerkmann
Abstract: We present ReverbFX, a new room impulse response (RIR) dataset designed for singing voice dereverberation research. Unlike existing datasets based on real recorded RIRs, ReverbFX features a diverse collection of RIRs captured from various reverb audio effect plugins commonly used in music production. We conduct comprehensive experiments using the proposed dataset to benchmark the challenge of dereverberation of singing voice recordings affected by artificial reverbs. We train two state-of-the-art generative models using ReverbFX and demonstrate that models trained with plugin-derived RIRs outperform those trained on realistic RIRs in artificial reverb scenarios.

Title: Effect of laboratory conditions on the perception of virtual stages for music
Authors: Ernesto Accolti
Abstract: This manuscript presents initial findings critical for supporting augmented acoustics experiments in custom-made hearing booths, addressing a key challenge in ensuring perceptual validity and experimental rigor in these highly sensitive setups. This validation ensures our proposed methodology is sound, guarantees the reliability of future results, and lays the foundational groundwork for subsequent perceptual studies and the development of robust guidelines for laboratory design in virtual acoustics research. A preliminary study on the effect of the acoustical conditions of three different rooms on the perception of virtual stages for music is presented: an anechoic room, a custom-made hearing booth with insufficient sound absorption, and another custom-made hearing booth with achievable sound absorption. The goal of this study is to assess the impact of these different conditions on the perception of virtual stages for music. The results show that the anechoic room and the hearing booth with achievable sound absorption have a difference between the total sound and the virtual sound below the just-noticeable difference, which means that the virtual sound is not perceived louder than it should. In contrast, the hearing booth with insufficient sound absorption has a difference above the just-noticeable difference, which means that the virtual sound is perceived louder than it should. This study provides a preliminary validation of the proposed methodology for assessing the acoustical conditions of custom-made hearing booths in stage acoustics experiments. Future work will include a more comprehensive analysis of the results, including the effect of different sound sources.

Title: Byzantine-Resilient Distributed P2P Energy Trading via Spatial-Temporal Anomaly Detection
Authors: Junhong Liu, Qinfei Long, Rong-Peng Liu, Wenjie Liu, Yunhe Hou
Abstract: Distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading mandates an escalating coupling between the physical power network and communication network, necessitating high-frequency sharing of real-time data among prosumers. However, this data-sharing scheme renders the system vulnerable to various malicious behaviors, as Byzantine agents can initiate cyberattacks by injecting sophisticated false data. To better investigate the impacts of malicious Byzantine faults, this paper develops a fully distributed P2P energy trading model by accounting for the high-fidelity physical network constraints. To further detect Byzantine faults and mitigate their impacts on distributed P2P energy trading problem, we propose an online spatial-temporal anomaly detection approach by leveraging the tensor learning method, which is informed by the domain knowledge to enable awesome detection performance. Moreover, to enhance its computational efficiency, we further develop closed-form solutions for the proposed detection approach. Subsequently, we derive theoretical conditions for guaranteeing optimality and convergence of the distributed P2P energy trading problem with anomaly detection mechanisms. Results from numerical simulations validate the effectiveness, optimality, and scalability of the proposed approach.

Title: A Feasibility Study of Task-Based fMRI at 0.55 T
Authors: Parsa Razmara, Takfarinas Medani, Anand A. Joshi, Majid Abbasi Sisara, Ye Tian, Sophia X. Cui, Justin P. Haldar, Krishna S. Nayak, Richard M. Leahy
Abstract: 0.55T MRI offers advantages compared to conventional field strengths, including reduced susceptibility artifacts and better compatibility with simultaneous EEG recordings. However, reliable task-based fMRI at 0.55T has not been significantly demonstrated. In this study, we establish a robust task-based fMRI protocol and analysis pipeline at 0.55T that achieves full brain coverage and results comparable to what is expected for activation extent and location. We attempted fMRI at 0.55T by combining EPI acquisition with custom analysis techniques. Finger-tapping and visual tasks were used, comparing 5- and 10-minute runs to enhance activation detection. The results show significant activations, demonstrating that high-quality task-based fMRI is achievable at 0.55T in single subjects. This study demonstrates that reliable task-based fMRI is feasible on 0.55T scanners, potentially broadening functional neuroimaging access in clinical and research settings where high-field MRI is unavailable or impractical, supporting broader diagnostic and research applications.

Title: Synergising Hierarchical Data Centers and Power Networks: A Privacy-Preserving Approach
Authors: Junhong Liu, Fei Teng, Yunhe Hou
Abstract: In the era of digitization, data centers have emerged as integral contributors sustaining our interlinked world, bearing responsibility for an increasing proportion of the world's energy consumption. To facilitate the their fast rollout while progressing towards net-zero energy systems, the synergy of hierarchical data centers (cloud-fog-edge) and power networks can play a pivotal role. However, existing centralized co-dispatch manners encroach on the privacy of different agents within the integrated systems, meanwhile suffering from the combinatorial explosion. In this research, we propose a near-optimal distributed privacy-preserving approach to solve the non-convex synergy (day-ahead co-dispatch) problem. The synergy problem is formulated as a mixed integer quadratically constrained quadratic programming considering both communication and energy conservation, where Lyapunov optimization is introduced to balance operating costs and uncertain communication delays. To mitigate impacts of the highly non-convex nature, the normalized multi-parametric disaggregation technique is leveraged to reformulate the problem into a mixed integer non-linear programming. To further overcome non-smoothness of the reformulated problem, the customized $\ell_1-$surrogate Lagrangian relaxation method with convergence guarantees is proposed to solve the problem in a distributed privacy-preserving manner. {The effectiveness, optimality, and scalability of the proposed methodologies for the synergy problem are validated via numerical simulations. Simulation results also indicate that computing tasks can be delayed and migrated within the hierarchical data centers, demonstrating the flexible resource allocation capabilities of the hierarchical data center architecture, further facilitating peak load balancing in the power network.

Title: Privacy-Preserving Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading via Hybrid Secure Computations
Authors: Junhong Liu, Qinfei Long, Rong-Peng Liu, Wenjie Liu, Xin Cui, Yunhe Hou
Abstract: The massive integration of uncertain distributed renewable energy resources into power systems raises power imbalance concerns. Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading provides a promising way to balance the prosumers' volatile energy power generation and demands locally. Particularly, to protect the privacy of prosumers, distributed P2P energy trading is broadly advocated. However, severe privacy leakage issues can emerge in the realistic fully distributed P2P energy trading paradigm. Meanwhile, in this paradigm, two-party and multi-party computations coexist, challenging the naive privacy-preserving techniques. To tackle privacy leakage issues arising from the fully distributed P2P energy trading, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving approach via hybrid secure computations. A secure multi-party computation mechanism consisting of offline and online phases is developed to ensure the security of shared data by leveraging the tailored secret sharing method. In addition, the Paillier encryption method based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem is proposed for both the secure two-party computation and the offline phase of the multi-party computation. The random encryption coefficient is designed to enhance the security of the two-party computation and simultaneously guarantee the convergence of the distributed optimization. The feasible range for the encryption coefficient is derived with a strict mathematical proof. Numerical simulations demonstrate the exactness, effectiveness, and scalability of the proposed privacy-preserving approach.

Title: Plug-and-Play Co-Occurring Face Attention for Robust Audio-Visual Speaker Extraction
Authors: Zexu Pan, Shengkui Zhao, Tingting Wang, Kun Zhou, Yukun Ma, Chong Zhang, Bin Ma
Abstract: Audio-visual speaker extraction isolates a target speaker's speech from a mixture speech signal conditioned on a visual cue, typically using the target speaker's face recording. However, in real-world scenarios, other co-occurring faces are often present on-screen, providing valuable speaker activity cues in the scene. In this work, we introduce a plug-and-play inter-speaker attention module to process these flexible numbers of co-occurring faces, allowing for more accurate speaker extraction in complex multi-person environments. We integrate our module into two prominent models: the AV-DPRNN and the state-of-the-art AV-TFGridNet. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets, including the highly overlapped VoxCeleb2 and sparsely overlapped MISP, demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines. Furthermore, cross-dataset evaluations on LRS2 and LRS3 confirm the robustness and generalizability of our method.

Title: A Unified RCS Modeling of Typical Targets for 3GPP ISAC Channel Standardization and Experimental Analysis
Authors: Yuxiang Zhang, Jianhua Zhang, Xidong Hu, Jiwei Zhang, Hongbo Xing, Huiwen Gong, Shilin Luo, Yifeng Xiong, Li Yu, Zhiqing Yuan, Guangyi Liu, Tao Jiang
Abstract: Accurate radar cross section (RCS) modeling is crucial for characterizing target scattering and improving the precision of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) channel modeling. Existing RCS models are typically designed for specific target types, leading to increased complexity and lack of generalization. This makes it difficult to standardize RCS models for 3GPP ISAC channels, which need to account for multiple typical target types simultaneously. Furthermore, 3GPP models must support both system-level and link-level simulations, requiring the integration of large-scale and small-scale scattering characteristics. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a unified RCS modeling framework that consolidates these two aspects. The model decomposes RCS into three components: (1) a large-scale power factor representing overall scattering strength, (2) a small-scale angular-dependent component describing directional scattering, and (3) a random component accounting for variations across target instances. We validate the model through mono-static RCS measurements for UAV, human, and vehicle targets across five frequency bands. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively capture RCS variations for different target types. Finally, the model is incorporated into an ISAC channel simulation platform to assess the impact of target RCS characteristics on path loss, delay spread, and angular spread, providing valuable insights for future ISAC system design.

Title: PromptEVC: Controllable Emotional Voice Conversion with Natural Language Prompts
Authors: Tianhua Qi, Shiyan Wang, Cheng Lu, Tengfei Song, Hao Yang, Zhanglin Wu, Wenming Zheng
Abstract: Controllable emotional voice conversion (EVC) aims to manipulate emotional expressions to increase the diversity of synthesized speech. Existing methods typically rely on predefined labels, reference audios, or prespecified factor values, often overlooking individual differences in emotion perception and expression. In this paper, we introduce PromptEVC that utilizes natural language prompts for precise and flexible emotion control. To bridge text descriptions with emotional speech, we propose emotion descriptor and prompt mapper to generate fine-grained emotion embeddings, trained jointly with reference embeddings. To enhance naturalness, we present a prosody modeling and control pipeline that adjusts the rhythm based on linguistic content and emotional cues. Additionally, a speaker encoder is incorporated to preserve identity. Experimental results demonstrate that PromptEVC outperforms state-of-the-art controllable EVC methods in emotion conversion, intensity control, mixed emotion synthesis, and prosody manipulation.

Title: Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation for Segmentation and Signal Unmixing
Authors: Nikola Andrejic, Milica Spasic, Igor Mihajlovic, Petra Milosavljevic, Djordje Pavlovic, Filip Milisavljevic, Uros Milivojevic, Danilo Delibasic, Ivana Mikic, Sinisa Todorovic
Abstract: This work introduces Ui2i, a novel model for unpaired image-to-image translation, trained on content-wise unpaired datasets to enable style transfer across domains while preserving content. Building on CycleGAN, Ui2i incorporates key modifications to better disentangle content and style features, and preserve content integrity. Specifically, Ui2i employs U-Net-based generators with skip connections to propagate localized shallow features deep into the generator. Ui2i removes feature-based normalization layers from all modules and replaces them with approximate bidirectional spectral normalization -- a parameter-based alternative that enhances training stability. To further support content preservation, channel and spatial attention mechanisms are integrated into the generators. Training is facilitated through image scale augmentation. Evaluation on two biomedical tasks -- domain adaptation for nuclear segmentation in immunohistochemistry (IHC) images and unmixing of biological structures superimposed in single-channel immunofluorescence (IF) images -- demonstrates Ui2i's ability to preserve content fidelity in settings that demand more accurate structural preservation than typical translation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, Ui2i is the first approach capable of separating superimposed signals in IF images using real, unpaired training data.

Title: On Kernel Design for Regularized Volterra Series Identification of Wiener-Hammerstein Systems
Authors: Yu Xu, Biqiang Mu, Tianshi Chen
Abstract: There have been increasing interests on the Volterra series identification with the kernel-based regularization method. The major difficulties are on the kernel design and efficiency of the corresponding implementation. In this paper, we first assume that the underlying system to be identified is the Wiener-Hammerstein (WH) system with polynomial nonlinearity. We then show how to design kernels with nonzero off-diagonal blocks for Volterra maps by taking into account the prior knowledge of the linear blocks and the structure of WH systems. Moreover, exploring the structure of the designed kernels leads to the same computational complexity as the state-of-the-art result, i.e., $O(N^3)$, where $N$ is the sample size, but with a significant difference that the proposed kernels are designed in a direct and flexible way. In addition, for a special case of the kernel and a class of widely used input signals, further exploring the separable structure of the output kernel matrix can lower the computational complexity from $O(N^3)$ to $O(N\gamma^2)$, where $\gamma$ is the separability rank of the output kernel matrix and can be much smaller than $N$. We finally run Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate the proposed kernels and the obtained theoretical results.

Title: Data-Driven Existence and Design of Target Output Controllers
Authors: Yuan Zhang, Wenxuan Xu, Mohamed Darouach, Tyrone Fernando
Abstract: Target output controllers aim at regulating a system's target outputs by placing poles of a suitable subsystem using partial state feedback, where full state controllability is not required. This paper establishes existence conditions for such controllers using input and partial state data, where the system dynamics are unknown. The approach bypasses traditional system identification steps and leverages the intrinsic structure of historical data to certify controller existence and synthesize a suitable feedback gain. Analytical characterizations are provided, ensuring that the resulting closed-loop system satisfies desired performance objectives such as pole placement or stabilization. Data-driven algorithms are then proposed to design target output controllers directly from data without identifying system parameters, where controllers with the order matching the number of target outputs and with minimum-order augmented target outputs are both addressed. Furthermore, a separation principle is revealed, decoupling the design of target output controllers from state observers. This enables the development of data-driven observer-based controllers that integrate estimation and control. Numerical examples validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

Title: REWIND: Speech Time Reversal for Enhancing Speaker Representations in Diffusion-based Voice Conversion
Authors: Ishan D. Biyani, Nirmesh J. Shah, Ashishkumar P. Gudmalwar, Pankaj Wasnik, Rajiv R. Shah
Abstract: Speech time reversal refers to the process of reversing the entire speech signal in time, causing it to play backward. Such signals are completely unintelligible since the fundamental structures of phonemes and syllables are destroyed. However, they still retain tonal patterns that enable perceptual speaker identification despite losing linguistic content. In this paper, we propose leveraging speaker representations learned from time reversed speech as an augmentation strategy to enhance speaker representation. Notably, speaker and language disentanglement in voice conversion (VC) is essential to accurately preserve a speaker's unique vocal traits while minimizing interference from linguistic content. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated in the context of state-of-the-art diffusion-based VC models. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach significantly improves speaker similarity-related scores while maintaining high speech quality.

Title: Physics-Informed Neural Network for Cross-Domain Predictive Control of Tapered Amplifier Thermal Stabilization
Authors: Yanpei Shi, Bo Feng, Yuxin Zhong, Haochen Guo, Bangcheng Han, Rui Feng
Abstract: Thermally induced laser noise poses a critical limitation to the sensitivity of quantum sensor arrays employing ultra-stable amplified lasers, primarily stemming from nonlinear gain-temperature coupling effects in tapered amplifiers (TAs). To address this challenge, we present a robust intelligent control strategy that synergistically integrates an encoder-decoder physics-informed gated recurrent unit (PI-GRU) network with a model predictive control (MPC) framework. Our methodology incorporates physical soft constraints into the neural network architecture, yielding a predictive model with enhanced physical consistency that demonstrates robust extrapolation capabilities beyond the training data distribution. Leveraging the PI-GRU model's accurate multi-step predictive performance, we implement a hierarchical parallel MPC architecture capable of real-time thermal instability compensation. This hybrid approach achieves cross-domain consistent thermal stabilization in TAs under diverse laser power operations. Remarkably, while trained exclusively on low-power operational data, our system demonstrates exceptional generalization, improving prediction accuracy by 58.2% and temperature stability by 69.1% in previously unseen high-power operating regimes, as experimentally validated. The novel synchronization of physics-informed neural networks with advanced MPC frameworks presented in this work establishes a groundbreaking paradigm for addressing robustness challenges in cross-domain predictive control applications, overcoming conventional modeling limitations.

Title: Dual-Polarization Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces for Holographic MIMO
Authors: Yida Zhang, Qiuyan Liu, Hongtao Luo, Yuqi Xia, Qiang Wang
Abstract: To address the limited wave domain signal processing capabilities of traditional single-polarized stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) in holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) systems, which stems from limited integration space, this paper proposes a dual-polarized SIM (DPSIM) architecture. By stacking dual-polarized reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (DPRIS), DPSIM can independently process signals of two orthogonal polarizations in the wave domain, thereby effectively suppressing polarization cross-interference (PCI) and inter-stream interference (ISI). We introduce a layer-by-layer gradient descent with water-filling (LGD-WF) algorithm to enhance end-to-end performance. Simulation results show that, under the same number of metasurface layers and unit size, the DPSIM-aided HMIMO system can support more simultaneous data streams for ISI-free parallel transmission compared to traditional SIM-aided systems. Furthermore, under different polarization imperfection conditions, both the spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) of the DPSIM-aided HMIMO system are significantly improved, approaching the theoretical upper bound.

Title: The Role of AI in Early Detection of Life-Threatening Diseases: A Retinal Imaging Perspective
Authors: Tariq M Khan, Toufique Ahmed Soomro, Imran Razzak
Abstract: Retinal imaging has emerged as a powerful, non-invasive modality for detecting and quantifying biomarkers of systemic diseases-ranging from diabetes and hypertension to Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disorders but current insights remain dispersed across platforms and specialties. Recent technological advances in optical coherence tomography (OCT/OCTA) and adaptive optics (AO) now deliver ultra-high-resolution scans (down to 5 {\mu}m ) with superior contrast and spatial integration, allowing early identification of microvascular abnormalities and neurodegenerative changes. At the same time, AI-driven and machine learning (ML) algorithms have revolutionized the analysis of large-scale retinal datasets, increasing sensitivity and specificity; for example, deep learning models achieve > 90 \% sensitivity for diabetic retinopathy and AUC = 0.89 for the prediction of cardiovascular risk from fundus photographs. The proliferation of mobile health technologies and telemedicine platforms further extends access, reduces costs, and facilitates community-based screening and longitudinal monitoring. Despite these breakthroughs, translation into routine practice is hindered by heterogeneous imaging protocols, limited external validation of AI models, and integration challenges within clinical workflows. In this review, we systematically synthesize the latest OCT/OCT and AO developments, AI/ML approaches, and mHealth/Tele-ophthalmology initiatives and quantify their diagnostic performance across disease domains. Finally, we propose a roadmap for multicenter protocol standardization, prospective validation trials, and seamless incorporation of retinal screening into primary and specialty care pathways-paving the way for precision prevention, early intervention, and ongoing treatment of life-threatening systemic diseases.

Abstract: In many industrial applications, signals with short periodic pulses, caused by repeated steps in the manufacturing process, are present, and their fundamental frequency or period may be of interest. Fundamental frequency estimation is in many cases performed by describing the periodic signal as a multiharmonic signal and employing the corresponding maximum likelihood estimator. However, since signals with short periodic pulses contain a large number of noise-only samples, the multiharmonic signal model is not optimal to describe them. In this work, two models of short periodic pulses with known and unknown pulse shape are considered. For both models, the corresponding maximum likelihood estimators, Fisher information matrices, and approximate Cramér-Rao lower bounds are presented. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed estimators outperform the maximum likelihood estimator based on the multiharmonic signal model for low signal-to-noise ratios.

Title: Continuous SpO2 Monitoring Using Reflectance Pulse Oximetry at the Wrist and Upper Arm During Overnight Sleep Apnea Recordings
Authors: Karen Adam, Clémentine Aguet, Patrick Theurillat, Florent Baty, Maximilian Boesch, Damien Ferrario, Mathieu Lemay, Martin Brutsche, Fabian Braun
Abstract: Sleep apnea (SA) is a chronic sleep-related disorder consisting of repetitive pauses or restrictions in airflow during sleep and is known to be a risk factor for cerebro- and cardiovascular disease. It is generally diagnosed using polysomnography (PSG) recorded overnight in an in-lab setting at the hospital. This includes the measurement of blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), which exhibits fluctuations caused by SA events. In this paper, we investigate the accuracy and utility of reflectance pulse oximetry from a wearable device as a means to continuously monitor SpO2 during sleep. To this end, we analyzed data from a cohort of 134 patients with suspected SA undergoing overnight PSG and wearing the watch-like device at two measurement locations (upper arm and wrist). Our data show that standard requirements for pulse oximetry measurements are met at both measurement locations, with an accuracy (root mean squared error) of 1.9% at the upper arm and 3.2% at the wrist. With a rejection rate of 3.1%, the upper arm yielded better results in terms of data quality when compared to the wrist location which had 30.4% of data rejected.

Title: Effective Fixed-Time Control for Constrained Nonlinear System
Authors: Chenglin Gong, Ziming Wang, Guanxuan Jiang, Xin Wang, Yiding Ji
Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the state transformation problem in non-strict full state-constrained systems by introducing an adaptive fixed-time control method, utilizing a one-to-one asymmetric nonlinear mapping auxiliary system. Additionally, we develop a class of multi-threshold event-triggered control strategies that facilitate autonomous controller updates, substantially reducing communication resource consumption. Notably, the self-triggered strategy distinguishes itself from other strategies by obviating the need for continuous real-time monitoring of the controller's state variables. By accurately forecasting the subsequent activation instance, this strategy significantly optimizes the efficiency of the control system. Moreover, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the semi-global practical fixed-time stability (SPFTS) criterion guarantees both tracking accuracy and closed-loop stability under state constraints, with convergence time independent of initial conditions. Finally, simulation results reveal that the proposed method significantly decreases the frequency of control command updates while maintaining tracking accuracy.

Title: Research on a Two-Layer Demand Response Framework for Electric Vehicle Users and Aggregators Based on LLMs
Authors: Zhaoyi Zhang, Chenggang Cui, Ning Yang, Chuanlin Zhang
Abstract: The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has increased the importance of demand response in smart grids. This paper proposes a two-layer demand response optimization framework for EV users and aggregators, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to balance electricity supply and demand and optimize energy utilization during EV charging. The upper-layer model, focusing on the aggregator, aims to maximize profits by adjusting retail electricity prices. The lower-layer model targets EV users, using LLMs to simulate charging demands under varying electricity prices and optimize both costs and user comfort. The study employs a multi-threaded LLM decision generator to dynamically analyze user behavior, charging preferences, and psychological factors. The framework utilizes the PSO method to optimize electricity prices, ensuring user needs are met while increasing aggregator profits. Simulation results show that the proposed model improves EV charging efficiency, alleviates peak power loads, and stabilizes smart grid operations.

Title: Dynamic Resource Allocation in Distributed MIMO-LEO Satellite Networks
Authors: Qihao Peng, Qu Luo, Yi Ma, Chuan Heng Foh, Pei Xiao, Maged Elkashlan, Rahim Tafazolli, George K. Karagiannidis
Abstract: This paper characterizes the impacts of channel estimation errors and Rician factors on achievable data rate and investigates the user scheduling strategy, combining scheme, power control, and dynamic bandwidth allocation to maximize the sum data rate in the distributed multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)-enabled low earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks. However, due to the resource-assignment problem, it is challenging to find the optimal solution for maximizing the sum data rate. To transform this problem into a more tractable form, we first quantify the channel estimation errors based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator and rigorously derive a closed-form lower bound of the achievable data rate, offering an explicit formulation for resource allocation. Then, to solve the NP-hard problem, we decompose it into three sub-problems, namely, user scheduling strategy, joint combination and power control, and dynamic bandwidth allocation, by using alternative optimization (AO). Specifically, the user scheduling is formulated as a graph coloring problem by iteratively updating an undirected graph based on user requirements, which is then solved using the DSatur algorithm. For the combining weights and power control, the successive convex approximation (SCA) and geometrical programming (GP) are adopted to obtain the sub-optimal solution with lower complexity. Finally, the optimal bandwidth allocation can be achieved by solving the concave problem. Numerical results validate the analytical tightness of the derived bound, especially for large Rician factors, and demonstrate significant performance gains over other benchmarks.

Title: Multitemporal Latent Dynamical Framework for Hyperspectral Images Unmixing
Authors: Ruiying Li, Bin Pan, Lan Ma, Xia Xu, Zhenwei Shi
Abstract: Multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing can capture dynamical evolution of materials. Despite its capability, current methods emphasize variability of endmembers while neglecting dynamics of abundances, which motivates our adoption of neural ordinary differential equations to model abundances temporally. However, this motivation is hindered by two challenges: the inherent complexity in defining, modeling and solving problem, and the absence of theoretical support. To address above challenges, in this paper, we propose a multitemporal latent dynamical (MiLD) unmixing framework by capturing dynamical evolution of materials with theoretical validation. For addressing multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing, MiLD consists of problem definition, mathematical modeling, solution algorithm and theoretical support. We formulate multitemporal unmixing problem definition by conducting ordinary differential equations and developing latent variables. We transfer multitemporal unmixing to mathematical model by dynamical discretization approaches, which describe the discreteness of observed sequence images with mathematical expansions. We propose algorithm to solve problem and capture dynamics of materials, which approximates abundance evolution by neural networks. Furthermore, we provide theoretical support by validating the crucial properties, which verifies consistency, convergence and stability theorems. The major contributions of MiLD include defining problem by ordinary differential equations, modeling problem by dynamical discretization approach, solving problem by multitemporal unmixing algorithm, and presenting theoretical support. Our experiments on both synthetic and real datasets have validated the utility of our work

Authors: Nicholas Cartocci, Antonios E. Gkikakis, Natalia Kurvina, Natnael Takele, Fabio Pera, Maria Teresa Settino, Darwin G. Caldwell, Jesús Ortiz
Abstract: A key aspect of developing fall prevention systems is the early prediction of a fall before it occurs. This paper presents a statistical overview of results obtained by analyzing 22 activities of daily living to recognize physiological patterns and estimate the risk of an imminent fall. The results demonstrate distinctive patterns between high-intensity and low-intensity activity using EMG, ECG, and respiration sensors, also indicating the presence of a proportional trend between movement velocity and muscle activity. These outcomes highlight the potential benefits of using these sensors in the future to direct the development of an activity recognition and risk prediction framework for physiological phenomena that can cause fall injuries.

Title: Analysis of Joint Radar and Communication in Disaster Scenarios
Authors: Ahmet Burak Ozyurt, Shreesh Mohalik, John S. Thompson
Abstract: With the increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters, there is a necessity for advanced technologies that can provide reliable situational awareness and communication. Conventional systems are often inadequate due to unreliable infrastructure, power grid failures, high investment costs and scalability challenges. This paper explores the potential of ad-hoc mesh joint radar and communication (JRC) networks as a scalable, resilient, energy-efficient solution for disaster management that can operate independently of conventional infrastructure. The proposed JRC network enhances disaster response by integrating target detection (such as identifying vital signs, hazardous leaks, and fires) with communication capabilities to ensure efficient information dissemination under intense clutter conditions. Key performance metrics, including data rate, Signal-to-Clutter and Noise Ratio (SCNR), probability of detection, and false alarm rate, are used to assess performance. An optimization approach is proposed to provide an energy-efficient resource allocation scheme. The results show the performance of ad-hoc mesh JRC systems, underscoring their potential to enhance disaster management efforts by addressing unique operational challenges.

Title: Ergonomic Assessment of Work Activities for an Industrial-oriented Wrist Exoskeleton
Authors: Roberto F. Pitzalis, Nicholas Cartocci, Christian Di Natali, Luigi Monica, Darwin G. Caldwell, Giovanni Berselli, Jesús Ortiz
Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) are the most common cause of work-related injuries and lost production involving approximately 1.7 billion people worldwide and mainly affect low back (more than 50%) and upper limbs (more than 40%). It has a profound effect on both the workers affected and the company. This paper provides an ergonomic assessment of different work activities in a horse saddle-making company, involving 5 workers. This aim guides the design of a wrist exoskeleton to reduce the risk of musculoskeletal diseases wherever it is impossible to automate the production process. This evaluation is done either through subjective and objective measurement, respectively using questionnaires and by measurement of muscle activation with sEMG sensors.

Title: Generative Image Compression by Estimating Gradients of the Rate-variable Feature Distribution
Authors: Minghao Han, Weiyi You, Jinhua Zhang, Leheng Zhang, Ce Zhu, Shuhang Gu
Abstract: While learned image compression (LIC) focuses on efficient data transmission, generative image compression (GIC) extends this framework by integrating generative modeling to produce photo-realistic reconstructed images. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based generative modeling framework tailored for generative image compression. Unlike prior diffusion-based approaches that indirectly exploit diffusion modeling, we reinterpret the compression process itself as a forward diffusion path governed by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). A reverse neural network is trained to reconstruct images by reversing the compression process directly, without requiring Gaussian noise initialization. This approach achieves smooth rate adjustment and photo-realistic reconstructions with only a minimal number of sampling steps. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing generative image compression approaches across a range of metrics, including perceptual distortion, statistical fidelity, and no-reference quality assessments.

Title: CNN-Based Channel Map Estimation for Movable Antenna Systems
Authors: Yitai Huang, Weidong Mei, Xin Wei, Zhi Chen, Boyu Ning
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) has attracted increasing attention in wireless communications due to its capability of wireless channel reconfiguration through local antenna movement within a confined region at the transmitter/receiver. However, to determine the optimal antenna positions, channel state information (CSI) within the entire region, termed small-scale channel map, is required, which poses a significant challenge due to the unaffordable overhead for exhaustive channel estimation at all positions. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we propose a new convolutional neural network (CNN)-based estimation scheme to reconstruct the small-scale channel map within a three-dimensional (3D) movement region. Specifically, we first collect a set of CSI measurements corresponding to a subset of MA positions and different receiver locations offline to comprehensively capture the environmental features. Subsequently, we train a CNN using the collected data, which is then used to reconstruct the full channel map during real-time transmission only based on a finite number of channel measurements taken at several selected MA positions within the 3D movement region. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can accurately reconstruct the small-scale channel map and outperforms other benchmark schemes.

Title: Cardiac Digital Twins at Scale from MRI: Open Tools and Representative Models from ~55000 UK Biobank Participants
Authors: Devran Ugurlu, Shuang Qian, Elliot Fairweather, Charlene Mauger, Bram Ruijsink, Laura Dal Toso, Yu Deng, Marina Strocchi, Reza Razavi, Alistair Young, Pablo Lamata, Steven Niederer, Martin Bishop
Abstract: A cardiac digital twin is a virtual replica of a patient's heart for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, risk assessment, and treatment planning of cardiovascular diseases. This requires an anatomically accurate patient-specific 3D structural representation of the heart, suitable for electro-mechanical simulations or study of disease mechanisms. However, generation of cardiac digital twins at scale is demanding and there are no public repositories of models across demographic groups. We describe an automatic open-source pipeline for creating patient-specific left and right ventricular meshes from cardiovascular magnetic resonance images, its application to a large cohort of ~55000 participants from UK Biobank, and the construction of the most comprehensive cohort of adult heart models to date, comprising 1423 representative meshes across sex (male, female), body mass index (range: 16 - 42 kg/m$^2$) and age (range: 49 - 80 years). Our code is available at this https URL , and pre-trained networks, representative volumetric meshes with fibers and UVCs will be made available soon.

Title: Multi-Mode Process Control Using Multi-Task Inverse Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Runze Lin, Junghui Chen, Biao Huang, Lei Xie, Hongye Su
Abstract: In the era of Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing, process systems engineering must adapt to digital transformation. While reinforcement learning offers a model-free approach to process control, its applications are limited by the dependence on accurate digital twins and well-designed reward functions. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel framework that integrates inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) with multi-task learning for data-driven, multi-mode control design. Using historical closed-loop data as expert demonstrations, IRL extracts optimal reward functions and control policies. A latent-context variable is incorporated to distinguish modes, enabling the training of mode-specific controllers. Case studies on a continuous stirred tank reactor and a fed-batch bioreactor validate the effectiveness of this framework in handling multi-mode data and training adaptable controllers.

Title: Channel-Aware Holographic Decision Fusion
Authors: Domenico Ciuonzo, Alessio Zappone, Marco Di Renzo
Abstract: This work investigates Distributed Detection (DD) in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) utilizing channel-aware binary-decision fusion over a shared flat-fading channel. A reconfigurable metasurface, positioned in the near-field of a limited number of receive antennas, is integrated to enable a holographic Decision Fusion (DF) system. This approach minimizes the need for multiple RF chains while leveraging the benefits of a large array. The optimal fusion rule for a fixed metasurface configuration is derived, alongside two suboptimal joint fusion rule and metasurface design strategies. These suboptimal approaches strike a balance between reduced complexity and lower system knowledge requirements, making them practical alternatives. The design objective focuses on effectively conveying the information regarding the phenomenon of interest to the FC while promoting energy-efficient data analytics aligned with the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. Simulation results underscore the viability of holographic DF, demonstrating its advantages even with suboptimal designs and highlighting the significant energy-efficiency gains achieved by the proposed system.

Title: Study of Lightweight Transformer Architectures for Single-Channel Speech Enhancement
Authors: Haixin Zhao, Nilesh Madhu
Abstract: In speech enhancement, achieving state-of-the-art (SotA) performance while adhering to the computational constraints on edge devices remains a formidable challenge. Networks integrating stacked temporal and spectral modelling effectively leverage improved architectures such as transformers; however, they inevitably incur substantial computational complexity and model expansion. Through systematic ablation analysis on transformer-based temporal and spectral modelling, we demonstrate that the architecture employing streamlined Frequency-Time-Frequency (FTF) stacked transformers efficiently learns global dependencies within causal context, while avoiding considerable computational demands. Utilising discriminators in training further improves learning efficacy and enhancement without introducing additional complexity during inference. The proposed lightweight, causal, transformer-based architecture with adversarial training (LCT-GAN) yields SoTA performance on instrumental metrics among contemporary lightweight models, but with far less overhead. Compared to DeepFilterNet2, the LCT-GAN only requires 6% of the parameters, at similar complexity and performance. Against CCFNet+(Lite), LCT-GAN saves 9% in parameters and 10% in multiply-accumulate operations yet yielding improved performance. Further, the LCT-GAN even outperforms more complex, common baseline models on widely used test datasets.

Title: Multimodal Assessment of Speech Impairment in ALS Using Audio-Visual and Machine Learning Approaches
Authors: Francesco Pierotti, Andrea Bandini
Abstract: The analysis of speech in individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a powerful tool to support clinicians in the assessment of bulbar dysfunction. However, current methods used in clinical practice consist of subjective evaluations or expensive instrumentation. This study investigates different approaches combining audio-visual analysis and machine learning to predict the speech impairment evaluation performed by clinicians. Using a small dataset of acoustic and kinematic features extracted from audio and video recordings of speech tasks, we trained and tested some regression models. The best performance was achieved using the extreme boosting machine regressor with multimodal features, which resulted in a root mean squared error of 0.93 on a scale ranging from 5 to 25. Results suggest that integrating audio-video analysis enhances speech impairment assessment, providing an objective tool for early detection and monitoring of bulbar dysfunction, also in home settings.

Title: Output Regulation of Linear Systems with Non-periodic Non-smooth Exogenous Signals
Authors: Zirui Niu, Daniele Astolfi, Giordano Scarciotti
Abstract: We address the output regulation problem of linear systems with non-smooth and non-periodic exogenous signals. Specifically, we first formulate and solve the full-information problem by designing a state-feedback controller. We study the solvability of the regulator equations, providing a new non-resonance condition. We then focus on the error-feedback problem, for which we design a (non-robust) internal model leveraging the concept of canonical realisation and applying a high-gain method for the stabilisation of the closed-loop system under the minimum-phase assumption. Finally, we study the regulation problem involving model parameter uncertainties. Drawing ideas from both hybrid and time-varying (smooth) output regulation, we propose two methods to establish an internal model that is robust to uncertainties. The first method is an extension of the hybrid internal model, while the second relies on a new concept of immersion. In this non-smooth case, the immersion is established based on integrals rather than derivatives. The effectiveness of the proposed solutions is illustrated by a circuit regulation example.

Title: CiUAV: A Multi-Task 3D Indoor Localization System for UAVs based on Channel State Information
Authors: Cunyi Yin, Chenwei Wang, Jing Chen, Hao Jiang, Xiren Miao, Shaocong Zheng Zhenghua Chen Senior, Hong Yan
Abstract: Accurate indoor positioning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is critical for logistics, surveillance, and emergency response applications, particularly in GPS-denied environments. Existing indoor localization methods, including optical tracking, ultra-wideband, and Bluetooth-based systems, face cost, accuracy, and robustness trade-offs, limiting their practicality for UAV navigation. This paper proposes CiUAV, a novel 3D indoor localization system designed for UAVs, leveraging channel state information (CSI) obtained from low-cost ESP32 IoT-based sensors. The system incorporates a dynamic automatic gain control (AGC) compensation algorithm to mitigate noise and stabilize CSI signals, significantly enhancing the robustness of the measurement. Additionally, a multi-task 3D localization model, Sensor-in-Sample (SiS), is introduced to enhance system robustness by addressing challenges related to incomplete sensor data and limited training samples. SiS achieves this by joint training with varying sensor configurations and sample sizes, ensuring reliable performance even in resource-constrained scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate that CiUAV achieves a LMSE localization error of 0.2629 m in a 3D space, achieving good accuracy and robustness. The proposed system provides a cost-effective and scalable solution, demonstrating its usefulness for UAV applications in resource-constrained indoor environments.

Title: PSRB: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Persian ASR Systems
Authors: Nima Sedghiyeh, Sara Sadeghi, Reza Khodadadi, Farzin Kashani, Omid Aghdaei, Somayeh Rahimi, Mohammad Sadegh Safari
Abstract: Although Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have become an integral part of modern technology, their evaluation remains challenging, particularly for low-resource languages such as Persian. This paper introduces Persian Speech Recognition Benchmark(PSRB), a comprehensive benchmark designed to address this gap by incorporating diverse linguistic and acoustic conditions. We evaluate ten ASR systems, including state-of-the-art commercial and open-source models, to examine performance variations and inherent biases. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of Persian ASR transcriptions, identifying key error types and proposing a novel metric that weights substitution errors. This metric enhances evaluation robustness by reducing the impact of minor and partial errors, thereby improving the precision of performance assessment. Our findings indicate that while ASR models generally perform well on standard Persian, they struggle with regional accents, children's speech, and specific linguistic challenges. These results highlight the necessity of fine-tuning and incorporating diverse, representative training datasets to mitigate biases and enhance overall ASR performance. PSRB provides a valuable resource for advancing ASR research in Persian and serves as a framework for developing benchmarks in other low-resource languages. A subset of the PSRB dataset is publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Active Learning-Enhanced Dual Control for Angle-Only Initial Relative Orbit Determination
Authors: Kui Xie, Giovanni Romagnoli, Giordana Bucchioni, Alberto Bemporad
Abstract: Accurate relative orbit determination is a key challenge in modern space operations, particularly when relying on angle-only measurements. The inherent observability limitations of this approach make initial state estimation difficult, impacting mission safety and performance. This work explores the use of active learning (AL) techniques to enhance observability by dynamically designing the input excitation signal offline and at runtime. Our approach leverages AL to design the input signal dynamically, enhancing the observability of the system without requiring additional hardware or predefined maneuvers. We incorporate a dual control technique to ensure target tracking while maintaining observability. The proposed method is validated through numerical simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in estimating the initial relative state of the chaser and target spacecrafts and its robustness to various initial relative distances and observation periods.

Title: Stochastic Geometry-Based Performance Evaluation for LEO Satellite-Assisted Space Caching
Authors: Chunyi Ma, Jiajie Xu, Jianhua Yang, Mustafa A. Kishk
Abstract: To achieve the Internet of Things (IoT) vision,Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a promising technology aimed at providing low-latency computing services to user equipment (UE). However, terrestrial MEC network struggles to provide service to UEs in remote and maritime region. Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks have the potential to overcome geographical restrictions and provide seamless global coverage for UEs. In this paper, we provide the first attempt to use stochastic geometry to investigate the performance of implementing space caching with LEO satellites (SATs) in the MEC network. We study a LEO satellite-assisted space caching MEC network, and LEO SATs can be equipped with servers to enable space caching, with the advantage of seamless coverage to assist terrestrial CSs for serving UEs in remote or maritime reigon. Using stochastic geometry and queuing theory, we establish an analytical framework for this MEC network. Meanwhile, we develop association strategies for UEs to connect with LEO SATs or CSs and utilize stochastic geometry to derive uplink and downlink coverage probabilities, considering the diversity of task and service types. On this basis, we employ the queuing theory to calculate the average delay to evaluate the system performance. Through Monte Carlo simulations and numerical results, the system performance is evaluated. The results show the potential of SAT spatial caching in improving the performance of the MEC network. Additionally, our results reveal useful insights such as the significant impact of the altitude and number of LEO SATs on the average delay of the network, providing helpful system-level recommendations for the design and configuration of the space-caching MEC network.

Title: Graph Neural Network Aided Detection for the Multi-User Multi-Dimensional Index Modulated Uplink
Authors: Xinyu Feng, Mohammed EL-Hajjar, Chao Xu, Lajos Hanzo
Abstract: The concept of Compressed Sensing-aided Space-Frequency Index Modulation (CS-SFIM) is conceived for the Large-Scale Multi-User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Uplink (LS-MU-MIMO-UL) of Next-Generation (NG) networks. Explicitly, in CS-SFIM, the information bits are mapped to both spatial- and frequency-domain indices, where we treat the activation patterns of the transmit antennas and of the subcarriers separately. Serving a large number of users in an MU-MIMO-UL system leads to substantial Multi-User Interference (MUI). Hence, we design the Space-Frequency (SF) domain matrix as a joint factor graph, where the Approximate Message Passing (AMP) and Expectation Propagation (EP) based MU detectors can be utilized. In the LS-MU-MIMO-UL scenario considered, the proposed system uses optimal Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) detectors as benchmarks for comparison with the proposed MP-based detectors. These MP-based detectors significantly reduce the detection complexity compared to ML detection, making the design eminently suitable for LS-MU scenarios. To further reduce the detection complexity and improve the detection performance, we propose a pair of Graph Neural Network (GNN) based detectors, which rely on the orthogonal AMP (OAMP) and on the EP algorithm, which we refer to as the GNN-AMP and GEPNet detectors, respectively. The GEPNet detector maximizes the detection performance, while the GNN-AMP detector strikes a performance versus complexity trade-off. The GNN is trained for a single system configuration and yet it can be used for any number of users in the system. The simulation results show that the GNN-based detector approaches the ML performance in various configurations.

Title: Prostate Cancer Screening with Artificial Intelligence-Enhanced Micro-Ultrasound: A Comparative Study with Traditional Methods
Authors: Muhammad Imran, Wayne G. Brisbane, Li-Ming Su, Jason P. Joseph, Wei Shao
Abstract: Background and objective: Micro-ultrasound (micro-US) is a novel imaging modality with diagnostic accuracy comparable to MRI for detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). We investigated whether artificial intelligence (AI) interpretation of micro-US can outperform clinical screening methods using PSA and digital rectal examination (DRE). Methods: We retrospectively studied 145 men who underwent micro-US guided biopsy (79 with csPCa, 66 without). A self-supervised convolutional autoencoder was used to extract deep image features from 2D micro-US slices. Random forest classifiers were trained using five-fold cross-validation to predict csPCa at the slice level. Patients were classified as csPCa-positive if 88 or more consecutive slices were predicted positive. Model performance was compared with a classifier using PSA, DRE, prostate volume, and age. Key findings and limitations: The AI-based micro-US model and clinical screening model achieved AUROCs of 0.871 and 0.753, respectively. At a fixed threshold, the micro-US model achieved 92.5% sensitivity and 68.1% specificity, while the clinical model showed 96.2% sensitivity but only 27.3% specificity. Limitations include a retrospective single-center design and lack of external validation. Conclusions and clinical implications: AI-interpreted micro-US improves specificity while maintaining high sensitivity for csPCa detection. This method may reduce unnecessary biopsies and serve as a low-cost alternative to PSA-based screening. Patient summary: We developed an AI system to analyze prostate micro-ultrasound images. It outperformed PSA and DRE in detecting aggressive cancer and may help avoid unnecessary biopsies.

Authors: Zhengchang Kou, Junhang Zhang, Chen Gong, Jie Ji, Nathiya Vaithiyalingam Chandra Sekaran, Zikai Wang, Rita J. Miller, Yaoheng Yang, Daniel Adolfo Llano, Qifa Zhou, Michael L. Oelze
Abstract: We present phase subtraction imaging (PSI), a new spatial-temporal beamforming method that enables micrometer level resolution imaging of microvessels in live animals without labels, which are microbubbles in ultrasound super-resolution imaging. Subtraction of relative phase differences between consecutive frames beamformed with mismatched apodizations is used in PSI to overcome the diffraction limit. We validated this method by imaging both the mouse brain and rabbit kidney using different ultrasound probes and scanning machines.

Title: Distributed equilibrium seeking in aggregative games: linear convergence under singular perturbations lens
Authors: Guido Carnevale, Filippo Fabiani, Filiberto Fele, Kostas Margellos, Giuseppe Notarstefano
Abstract: We present a fully-distributed algorithm for Nash equilibrium seeking in aggregative games over networks. The proposed scheme endows each agent with a gradient-based scheme equipped with a tracking mechanism to locally reconstruct the aggregative variable, which is not available to the agents. We show that our method falls into the framework of singularly perturbed systems, as it involves the interconnection between a fast subsystem - the global information reconstruction dynamics - with a slow one concerning the optimization of the local strategies. This perspective plays a key role in analyzing the scheme with a constant stepsize, and in proving its linear convergence to the Nash equilibrium in strongly monotone games with local constraints. By exploiting the flexibility of our aggregative variable definition (not necessarily the arithmetic average of the agents' strategy), we show the efficacy of our algorithm on a realistic voltage support case study for the smart grid.

Title: WiCAL: Accurate Wi-Fi-Based 3D Localization Enabled by Collaborative Antenna Arrays
Authors: Fuhai Wang, Zhe Li, Rujing Xiong, Tiebin Mi, Robert Caiming Qiu
Abstract: Accurate 3D localization is essential for realizing advanced sensing functionalities in next-generation Wi-Fi communication systems. This study investigates the potential of multistatic localization in Wi-Fi networks through the deployment of multiple cooperative antenna arrays. The collaborative gain offered by these arrays is twofold: (i) intra-array coherent gain at the wavelength scale among antenna elements, and (ii) inter-array cooperative gain across arrays. To evaluate the feasibility and performance of this approach, we develop WiCAL (Wi-Fi Collaborative Antenna Localization), a system built upon commercial Wi-Fi infrastructure equipped with uniform rectangular arrays. These arrays are driven by multiplexing embedded radio frequency chains available in standard access points or user devices, thereby eliminating the need for sophisticated, costly, and power-hungry multi-transceiver modules typically required in multiple-input and multiple-output systems. To address phase offsets introduced by RF chain multiplexing, we propose a three-stage, fine-grained phase alignment scheme to synchronize signals across antenna elements within each array. A bidirectional spatial smoothing MUSIC algorithm is employed to estimate angles of arrival (AoAs) and mitigate performance degradation caused by correlated interference. To further exploit inter-array cooperative gain, we elaborate on the synchronization mechanism among distributed URAs, which enables direct position determination by bypassing intermediate angle estimation. Once synchronized, the distributed URAs effectively form a virtual large-scale array, significantly enhancing spatial resolution and localization accuracy.

Title: Expectation-maximization for multi-reference alignment: Two pitfalls and one remedy
Authors: Amnon Balanov, Wasim Huleihel, Tamir Bendory
Abstract: We study the multi-reference alignment model, which involves recovering a signal from noisy observations that have been randomly transformed by an unknown group action, a fundamental challenge in statistical signal processing, computational imaging, and structural biology. While much of the theoretical literature has focused on the asymptotic sample complexity of this model, the practical performance of reconstruction algorithms, particularly of the omnipresent expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a detailed investigation of EM in the challenging low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. We identify and characterize two failure modes that emerge in this setting. The first, called Einstein from Noise, reveals a strong sensitivity to initialization, with reconstructions resembling the input template regardless of the true underlying signal. The second phenomenon, referred to as the Ghost of Newton, involves EM initially converging towards the correct solution but later diverging, leading to a loss of reconstruction fidelity. We provide theoretical insights and support our findings through numerical experiments. Finally, we introduce a simple, yet effective modification to EM based on mini-batching, which mitigates the above artifacts. Supported by both theory and experiments, this mini-batching approach processes small data subsets per iteration, reducing initialization bias and computational cost, while maintaining accuracy comparable to full-batch EM.

Title: Quasi Steady-State Frequency
Authors: Joan Gutierrez-Florensa, Alvaro Ortega, Lukas Sigrist, Federico Milano
Abstract: Accurate frequency estimation is critical for the control, monitoring and protection of electrical power systems, in particular, of systems with a high penetration of power electronics. This paper introduces the novel concept of Quasi Steady-State (QSS) frequency as a quantity that fills the gap between stationary and instantaneous frequency. QSS frequency coincides with the fundamental frequency of an AC voltage in any stationary conditions, including unbalanced and non-sinusoidal, and is able to capture the time-varying fundamental frequency in transient conditions. The paper also proposes a metric borrowed from fluid dynamics, namely, the time derivative of the circulation, to define the scope of validity of the QSS frequency. Analytical examples as well as a case study based on a fully-fledged EMT model of the IEEE 39-bus system serve to illustrate, respectively, the properties of the QSS frequency and its behavior in transient conditions.

Title: Multi-Modal Artificial Intelligence of Embryo Grading and Pregnancy Prediction in Assisted Reproductive Technology: A Review
Authors: Xueqiang Ouyang, Jia Wei
Abstract: As a global disease, infertility has always affected human beings. The development of assisted reproductive technology can effectively solve this disease. However, the traditional in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer technology still faces many challenges in improving the success rate of pregnancy, such as the subjectivity of embryo grading and the inefficiency of integrating multi-modal data. Therefore, the introduction of artificial intelligence-based technologies is particularly crucial. This article reviews the application progress of multi-modal artificial intelligence in embryo grading and pregnancy prediction based on different data modalities (including static images, time-lapse videos and structured table data) from a new perspective, and discusses the main challenges in current research, such as the complexity of multi-modal information fusion and data scarcity.

Title: ZV-Sim: Probabilistic Simulation Framework for Pre-emergent Novel Zoonose Tracking
Authors: Joseph Maffetone, Julia Gersey, Pei Zhang
Abstract: ZV-Sim is an open-source, modular Python framework for probabilistic simulation and analysis of pre-emergent novel zoonotic diseases using pervasive sensing data. It incorporates customizable Human and Animal Presence agents that leverage known and simulated location data, contact networks, and illness reports to assess and predict disease origins and spread. The framework supports Monte Carlo experiments to analyze outcomes with various user-defined movement and probability models. Although initial models are basic and illustrative, ZV-Sim's extensible design facilitates the integration of more sophisticated models as richer data become available, enhancing future capabilities in zoonotic disease tracking. The source code is publicly available \href{this https URL}{\underline{\textit{here}}}.

Title: Stability of two-dimensional SISO LTI system with bounded feedback gain that has bounded derivative
Authors: Anton Ponomarev, Lutz Gröll
Abstract: We consider a two-dimensional SISO LTI system closed by uncertain linear feedback. The feedback gain is time-varying, bounded, and has a bounded derivative (both bounds are known). We investigate the asymptotic stability of this system under all admissible behaviors of the gain. Note that the situation is similar to the classical absolute stability problem of Lurie--Aizerman with two differences: linearity and derivative constraint. Our method of analysis is therefore inspired by the variational ideas of Pyatnitskii, Barabanov, Margaliot, and others developed for the absolute stability problem. We derive the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation for a function describing the "most unstable" of the possible portraits of the closed-loop system. A numerical method is proposed for solving the equation. Based on the solution, sufficient conditions are formulated for the asymptotic stability and instability. The method is applied to an equation arising from the analysis of a power electronics synchronization circuit.

Title: Numerical estimation of the lock-in domain of a DC/AC inverter
Authors: Anton Ponomarev, Lutz Gröll, Veit Hagenmeyer
Abstract: We estimate the lock-in domain of the origin of a current control system which is used in common DC/AC inverter designs. The system is a cascade connection of a 4-dimensional linear system (current controller, CC) followed by a two-dimensional nonlinear system (phase-locked loop, PLL). For the PLL, we construct a Lyapunov function via numerical approximation of its level curves. In combination with the quadratic Lyapunov function of the CC, it forms a vector Lyapunov function (VLF) for the overall system. A forward-invariant set of the VLF is found via numerical application of the comparison principle. By LaSalle's invariance principle, convergence to the origin is established.

Title: Robot Operation of Home Appliances by Reading User Manuals
Authors: Jian Zhang, Hanbo Zhang, Anxing Xiao, David Hsu
Abstract: Operating home appliances, among the most common tools in every household, is a critical capability for assistive home robots. This paper presents ApBot, a robot system that operates novel household appliances by "reading" their user manuals. ApBot faces multiple challenges: (i) infer goal-conditioned partial policies from their unstructured, textual descriptions in a user manual document, (ii) ground the policies to the appliance in the physical world, and (iii) execute the policies reliably over potentially many steps, despite compounding errors. To tackle these challenges, ApBot constructs a structured, symbolic model of an appliance from its manual, with the help of a large vision-language model (VLM). It grounds the symbolic actions visually to control panel elements. Finally, ApBot closes the loop by updating the model based on visual feedback. Our experiments show that across a wide range of simulated and real-world appliances, ApBot achieves consistent and statistically significant improvements in task success rate, compared with state-of-the-art large VLMs used directly as control policies. These results suggest that a structured internal representations plays an important role in robust robot operation of home appliances, especially, complex ones.

Title: ArVoice: A Multi-Speaker Dataset for Arabic Speech Synthesis
Authors: Hawau Olamide Toyin, Rufael Marew, Humaid Alblooshi, Samar M. Magdy, Hanan Aldarmaki
Abstract: We introduce ArVoice, a multi-speaker Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) speech corpus with diacritized transcriptions, intended for multi-speaker speech synthesis, and can be useful for other tasks such as speech-based diacritic restoration, voice conversion, and deepfake detection. ArVoice comprises: (1) a new professionally recorded set from six voice talents with diverse demographics, (2) a modified subset of the Arabic Speech Corpus; and (3) high-quality synthetic speech from two commercial systems. The complete corpus consists of a total of 83.52 hours of speech across 11 voices; around 10 hours consist of human voices from 7 speakers. We train three open-source TTS and two voice conversion systems to illustrate the use cases of the dataset. The corpus is available for research use.

Title: Training Articulatory Inversion Models for Inter-Speaker Consistency
Authors: Charles McGhee, Mark J.F. Gales, Kate M. Knill
Abstract: Acoustic-to-Articulatory Inversion (AAI) attempts to model the inverse mapping from speech to articulation. Exact articulatory prediction from speech alone may be impossible, as speakers can choose different forms of articulation seemingly without reference to their vocal tract structure. However, once a speaker has selected an articulatory form, their productions vary minimally. Recent works in AAI have proposed adapting Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models to single-speaker datasets, claiming that these single-speaker models provide a universal articulatory template. In this paper, we investigate whether SSL-adapted models trained on single and multi-speaker data produce articulatory targets which are consistent across speaker identities for English and Russian. We do this through the use of a novel evaluation method which extracts articulatory targets using minimal pair sets. We also present a training method which can improve inter-speaker consistency using only speech data.

Authors: Christopher Dobrian, Omar Costa Hamido
Abstract: Quantum computing can be employed in computer-aided music composition to control various attributes of the music at different structural levels. This article describes the application of quantum simulation to model compositional decision making, the simulation of quantum particle tracking to produce noise-based timbres, the use of basis state vector rotation to cause changing probabilistic behaviors in granular harmonic textures, and the exploitation of quantum measurement error to cause noisy perturbations of spatial soundpaths. We describe the concepts fundamental to these techniques, we provide algorithms and software enacting them, and we provide examples demonstrating their implementation in computer-generated music.

Title: Least Squares Model Reduction: A Two-Stage System-Theoretic Interpretation
Authors: Alberto Padoan
Abstract: Model reduction simplifies complex dynamical systems while preserving essential properties. This paper revisits a recently proposed system-theoretic framework for least squares moment matching. It interprets least squares model reduction in terms of two steps process: constructing a surrogate model to satisfy interpolation constraints, then projecting it onto a reduced-order space. Using tools from output regulation theory and Krylov projections, this approach provides a new view on classical methods. For illustration, we reexamine the least-squares model reduction method by Lucas and Smith, offering new insights into its structure.

Title: Music's Multimodal Complexity in AVQA: Why We Need More than General Multimodal LLMs
Authors: Wenhao You, Xingjian Diao, Chunhui Zhang, Keyi Kong, Weiyi Wu, Zhongyu Ouyang, Chiyu Ma, Tingxuan Wu, Noah Wei, Zong Ke, Ming Cheng, Soroush Vosoughi, Jiang Gui
Abstract: While recent Multimodal Large Language Models exhibit impressive capabilities for general multimodal tasks, specialized domains like music necessitate tailored approaches. Music Audio-Visual Question Answering (Music AVQA) particularly underscores this, presenting unique challenges with its continuous, densely layered audio-visual content, intricate temporal dynamics, and the critical need for domain-specific knowledge. Through a systematic analysis of Music AVQA datasets and methods, this position paper identifies that specialized input processing, architectures incorporating dedicated spatial-temporal designs, and music-specific modeling strategies are critical for success in this domain. Our study provides valuable insights for researchers by highlighting effective design patterns empirically linked to strong performance, proposing concrete future directions for incorporating musical priors, and aiming to establish a robust foundation for advancing multimodal musical understanding. This work is intended to inspire broader attention and further research, supported by a continuously updated anonymous GitHub repository of relevant papers: this https URL.

Title: Phir Hera Fairy: An English Fairytaler is a Strong Faker of Fluent Speech in Low-Resource Indian Languages
Authors: Praveen Srinivasa Varadhan, Srija Anand, Soma Siddhartha, Mitesh M.Khapra
Abstract: What happens when an English Fairytaler is fine-tuned on Indian languages? We evaluate how the English F5-TTS model adapts to 11 Indian languages, measuring polyglot fluency, voice-cloning, style-cloning, and code-mixing. We compare: (i) training from scratch, (ii) fine-tuning English F5 on Indian data, and (iii) fine-tuning on both Indian and English data to prevent forgetting. Fine-tuning with only Indian data proves most effective and the resultant IN-F5 is a near-human polyglot; that enables speakers of one language (e.g., Odia) to fluently speak in another (e.g., Hindi). Our results show English pretraining aids low-resource TTS in reaching human parity. To aid progress in other low-resource languages, we study data-constrained setups and arrive at a compute optimal strategy. Finally, we show IN-F5 can synthesize unseen languages like Bhojpuri and Tulu using a human-in-the-loop approach for zero-resource TTS via synthetic data generation.

Title: Uni-VERSA: Versatile Speech Assessment with a Unified Network
Authors: Jiatong Shi, Hye-Jin Shim, Shinji Watanabe
Abstract: Subjective listening tests remain the golden standard for speech quality assessment, but are costly, variable, and difficult to scale. In contrast, existing objective metrics, such as PESQ, F0 correlation, and DNSMOS, typically capture only specific aspects of speech quality. To address these limitations, we introduce Uni-VERSA, a unified network that simultaneously predicts various objective metrics, encompassing naturalness, intelligibility, speaker characteristics, prosody, and noise, for a comprehensive evaluation of speech signals. We formalize its framework, evaluation protocol, and applications in speech enhancement, synthesis, and quality control. A benchmark based on the URGENT24 challenge, along with a baseline leveraging self-supervised representations, demonstrates that Uni-VERSA provides a viable alternative to single-aspect evaluation methods. Moreover, it aligns closely with human perception, making it a promising approach for future speech quality assessment.

Title: Foundation Model Hidden Representations for Heart Rate Estimation from Auscultation
Authors: Jingping Nie, Dung T. Tran, Karan Thakkar, Vasudha Kowtha, John Huang, Carlos Avendano, Erdrin Azemi, Vikramjit Mitra
Abstract: Auscultation, particularly heart sound, is a non-invasive technique that provides essential vital sign information. Recently, self-supervised acoustic representation foundation models (FMs) have been proposed to offer insights into acoustics-based vital signs. However, there has been little exploration of the extent to which auscultation is encoded in these pre-trained FM representations. In this work, using a publicly available phonocardiogram (PCG) dataset and a heart rate (HR) estimation model, we conduct a layer-wise investigation of six acoustic representation FMs: HuBERT, wav2vec2, wavLM, Whisper, Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP), and an in-house CLAP model. Additionally, we implement the baseline method from Nie et al., 2024 (which relies on acoustic features) and show that overall, representation vectors from pre-trained foundation models (FMs) offer comparable performance to the baseline. Notably, HR estimation using the representations from the audio encoder of the in-house CLAP model outperforms the results obtained from the baseline, achieving a lower mean absolute error (MAE) across various train/validation/test splits despite the domain mismatch.

Title: Polarforming for Wireless Networks: Opportunities and Challenges
Authors: Jingze Ding, Zijian Zhou, Bingli Jiao, Rui Zhang
Abstract: Polarforming emerges as a promising technique for manipulating the polarization of electromagnetic (EM) waves by shaping the polarization of an antenna into a desired state. By dynamically adjusting antenna polarization, polarforming enables real-time polarization matching or mismatching with received EM waves, thereby leveraging polarization degrees of freedom (DoFs) to enhance wireless communication performance. In this article, we first present an overview of the fundamental principles and design approaches underlying the polarforming technique. We then analyze the key advantages of polarforming, including hardware cost reduction, depolarization mitigation, channel adaptation, signal power enhancement, and interference suppression. Furthermore, we explore promising applications of polarforming for next-generation wireless networks. Numerical case studies demonstrate the substantial performance gains of polarforming over conventional fixed-polarization antenna (FPA) systems, along with a discussion of implementation challenges to motivate future research.

Title: Can Large Language Models Predict Audio Effects Parameters from Natural Language?
Authors: Seungheon Doh, Junghyun Koo, Marco A. Martínez-Ramírez, Wei-Hsiang Liao, Juhan Nam, Yuki Mitsufuji
Abstract: In music production, manipulating audio effects (Fx) parameters through natural language has the potential to reduce technical barriers for non-experts. We present LLM2Fx, a framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict Fx parameters directly from textual descriptions without requiring task-specific training or fine-tuning. Our approach address the text-to-effect parameter prediction (Text2Fx) task by mapping natural language descriptions to the corresponding Fx parameters for equalization and reverberation. We demonstrate that LLMs can generate Fx parameters in a zero-shot manner that elucidates the relationship between timbre semantics and audio effects in music production. To enhance performance, we introduce three types of in-context examples: audio Digital Signal Processing (DSP) features, DSP function code, and few-shot examples. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based Fx parameter generation outperforms previous optimization approaches, offering competitive performance in translating natural language descriptions to appropriate Fx settings. Furthermore, LLMs can serve as text-driven interfaces for audio production, paving the way for more intuitive and accessible music production tools.

Title: Non-invasive maturity assessment of iPSC-CMs based on optical maturity characteristics using interpretable AI
Authors: Fabian Scheurer, Alexander Hammer, Mario Schubert, Robert-Patrick Steiner, Oliver Gamm, Kaomei Guan, Frank Sonntag, Hagen Malberg, Martin Schmidt
Abstract: Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) are an important resource for the identification of new therapeutic targets and cardioprotective drugs. After differentiation iPSC-CMs show an immature, fetal-like phenotype. Cultivation of iPSC-CMs in lipid-supplemented maturation medium (MM) strongly enhances their structural, metabolic and functional phenotype. Nevertheless, assessing iPSC-CM maturation state remains challenging as most methods are time consuming and go in line with cell damage or loss of the sample. To address this issue, we developed a non-invasive approach for automated classification of iPSC-CM maturity through interpretable artificial intelligence (AI)-based analysis of beat characteristics derived from video-based motion analysis. In a prospective study, we evaluated 230 video recordings of early-state, immature iPSC-CMs on day 21 after differentiation (d21) and more mature iPSC-CMs cultured in MM (d42, MM). For each recording, 10 features were extracted using Maia motion analysis software and entered into a support vector machine (SVM). The hyperparameters of the SVM were optimized in a grid search on 80 % of the data using 5-fold cross-validation. The optimized model achieved an accuracy of 99.5 $\pm$ 1.1 % on a hold-out test set. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) identified displacement, relaxation-rise time and beating duration as the most relevant features for assessing maturity level. Our results suggest the use of non-invasive, optical motion analysis combined with AI-based methods as a tool to assess iPSC-CMs maturity and could be applied before performing functional readouts or drug testing. This may potentially reduce the variability and improve the reproducibility of experimental studies.

Title: VibE-SVC: Vibrato Extraction with High-frequency F0 Contour for Singing Voice Conversion
Authors: Joon-Seung Choi, Dong-Min Byun, Hyung-Seok Oh, Seong-Whan Lee
Abstract: Controlling singing style is crucial for achieving an expressive and natural singing voice. Among the various style factors, vibrato plays a key role in conveying emotions and enhancing musical depth. However, modeling vibrato remains challenging due to its dynamic nature, making it difficult to control in singing voice conversion. To address this, we propose VibESVC, a controllable singing voice conversion model that explicitly extracts and manipulates vibrato using discrete wavelet transform. Unlike previous methods that model vibrato implicitly, our approach decomposes the F0 contour into frequency components, enabling precise transfer. This allows vibrato control for enhanced flexibility. Experimental results show that VibE-SVC effectively transforms singing styles while preserving speaker similarity. Both subjective and objective evaluations confirm high-quality conversion.

Title: Collision-free Control Barrier Functions for General Ellipsoids via Separating Hyperplane
Authors: Zeming Wu, Lu Liu
Abstract: This paper presents a novel collision avoidance method for general ellipsoids based on control barrier functions (CBFs) and separating hyperplanes. First, collision-free conditions for general ellipsoids are analytically derived using the concept of dual cones. These conditions are incorporated into the CBF framework by extending the system dynamics of controlled objects with separating hyperplanes, enabling efficient and reliable collision avoidance. The validity of the proposed collision-free CBFs is rigorously proven, ensuring their effectiveness in enforcing safety constraints. The proposed method requires only single-level optimization, significantly reducing computational time compared to state-of-the-art methods. Numerical simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed algorithm.

Title: Spotlight-TTS: Spotlighting the Style via Voiced-Aware Style Extraction and Style Direction Adjustment for Expressive Text-to-Speech
Authors: Nam-Gyu Kim, Deok-Hyeon Cho, Seung-Bin Kim, Seong-Whan Lee
Abstract: Recent advances in expressive text-to-speech (TTS) have introduced diverse methods based on style embedding extracted from reference speech. However, synthesizing high-quality expressive speech remains challenging. We propose Spotlight-TTS, which exclusively emphasizes style via voiced-aware style extraction and style direction adjustment. Voiced-aware style extraction focuses on voiced regions highly related to style while maintaining continuity across different speech regions to improve expressiveness. We adjust the direction of the extracted style for optimal integration into the TTS model, which improves speech quality. Experimental results demonstrate that Spotlight-TTS achieves superior performance compared to baseline models in terms of expressiveness, overall speech quality, and style transfer capability. Our audio samples are publicly available.

Title: Dynamical ON-OFF Control with Trajectory Prediction for Multi-RIS Wireless Networks
Authors: Kaining Wang, Bo Yang, Yusheng Lei, Zhiwen Yu, Xuelin Cao, George C. Alexandropoulos, Marco Di Renzo, Chau Yuen
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to reconfigure wireless environments by dynamically controlling the phase, amplitude, and polarization of impinging waves. However, as nearly passive reflective metasurfaces, RISs may not distinguish between desired and interference signals, which can lead to severe spectrum pollution and even affect performance negatively. In particular, in large-scale networks, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the receiving node can be degraded due to excessive interference reflected from the RIS. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we propose in this paper a trajectory prediction-based dynamical control algorithm (TPC) for anticipating RIS ON-OFF states sequence, integrating a long-short-term-memory (LSTM) scheme to predict user trajectories. In particular, through a codebook-based algorithm, the RIS controller adaptively coordinates the configuration of the RIS elements to maximize the received SINR. Our simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed TPC method over various system settings.

Title: DeepConvContext: A Multi-Scale Approach to Timeseries Classification in Human Activity Recognition
Authors: Marius Bock, Michael Moeller, Kristof Van Laerhoven
Abstract: Despite recognized limitations in modeling long-range temporal dependencies, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has traditionally relied on a sliding window approach to segment labeled datasets. Deep learning models like the DeepConvLSTM typically classify each window independently, thereby restricting learnable temporal context to within-window information. To address this constraint, we propose DeepConvContext, a multi-scale time series classification framework for HAR. Drawing inspiration from the vision-based Temporal Action Localization community, DeepConvContext models both intra- and inter-window temporal patterns by processing sequences of time-ordered windows. Unlike recent HAR models that incorporate attention mechanisms, DeepConvContext relies solely on LSTMs -- with ablation studies demonstrating the superior performance of LSTMs over attention-based variants for modeling inertial sensor data. Across six widely-used HAR benchmarks, DeepConvContext achieves an average 10% improvement in F1-score over the classic DeepConvLSTM, with gains of up to 21%. Code to reproduce our experiments is publicly available via this http URL.

Title: Dub-S2ST: Textless Speech-to-Speech Translation for Seamless Dubbing
Authors: Jeongsoo Choi, Jaehun Kim, Joon Son Chung
Abstract: This paper introduces a cross-lingual dubbing system that translates speech from one language to another while preserving key characteristics such as duration, speaker identity, and speaking speed. Despite the strong translation quality of existing speech translation approaches, they often overlook the transfer of speech patterns, leading to mismatches with source speech and limiting their suitability for dubbing applications. To address this, we propose a discrete diffusion-based speech-to-unit translation model with explicit duration control, enabling time-aligned translation. We then synthesize speech based on the predicted units and source identity with a conditional flow matching model. Additionally, we introduce a unit-based speed adaptation mechanism that guides the translation model to produce speech at a rate consistent with the source, without relying on any text. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework generates natural and fluent translations that align with the original speech's duration and speaking pace, while achieving competitive translation performance.

Title: COM Adjustment Mechanism Control for Multi-Configuration Motion Stability of Unmanned Deformable Vehicle
Authors: Jun Liu, Hongxun Liu, Cheng Zhang, Jiandang Xing, Shang Jiang, Ping Jiang
Abstract: An unmanned deformable vehicle is a wheel-legged robot transforming between two configurations: vehicular and humanoid states, with different motion modes and stability characteristics. To address motion stability in multiple configurations, a center-of-mass adjustment mechanism was designed. Further, a motion stability hierarchical control algorithm was proposed, and an electromechanical model based on a two-degree-of-freedom center-of-mass adjustment mechanism was established. An unmanned-deformable-vehicle vehicular-state steady-state steering dynamics model and a gait planning kinematic model of humanoid state walking were established. A stability hierarchical control strategy was designed to realize the stability control. The results showed that the steady-state steering stability in vehicular state and the walking stability in humanoid state could be significantly improved by controlling the slider motion.

Title: Uncertainty Partitioning with Probabilistic Feasibility and Performance Guarantees for Chance-Constrained Optimization
Authors: Francesco Cordiano, Matin Jafarian, Bart De Schutter
Abstract: We propose a novel distribution-free scheme to solve optimization problems where the goal is to minimize the expected value of a cost function subject to probabilistic constraints. Unlike standard sampling-based methods, our idea consists of partitioning the uncertainty domain in a user-defined number of sets, enabling more flexibility in the trade-off between conservatism and computational complexity. We provide sufficient conditions to ensure that our approximated problem is feasible for the original stochastic program, in terms of chance constraint satisfaction. In addition, we perform a rigorous performance analysis, by quantifying the distance between the optimal values of the original and the approximated problem. We show that our approach is tractable for optimization problems that include model predictive control of piecewise affine systems, and we demonstrate the benefits of our approach, in terms of the trade-off between conservatism and computational complexity, on a numerical example.

Our new algorithm, Double Spectral Control (DSC), matches the best known regret guarantees while exponentially improving runtime complexity over previous approaches in its dependence on the system's stability margin. Our key innovation is a two-level spectral approximation strategy, leveraging double convolution with a universal basis of spectral filters, enabling efficient and accurate learning of the best linear dynamical controllers.

Title: Scattering Networks on Noncommutative Finite Groups
Authors: Maria Teresa Arias, Davide Barbieri, Eugenio Hernández
Abstract: Scattering Networks were initially designed to elucidate the behavior of early layers in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) over Euclidean spaces and are grounded in wavelets. In this work, we introduce a scattering transform on an arbitrary finite group (not necessarily abelian) within the context of group-equivariant convolutional neural networks (G-CNNs). We present wavelets on finite groups and analyze their similarity to classical wavelets. We demonstrate that, under certain conditions in the wavelet coefficients, the scattering transform is non-expansive, stable under deformations, preserves energy, equivariant with respect to left and right group translations, and, as depth increases, the scattering coefficients are less sensitive to group translations of the signal, all desirable properties of convolutional neural networks. Furthermore, we provide examples illustrating the application of the scattering transform to classify data with domains involving abelian and nonabelian groups.

Title: Hybrid Disagreement-Diversity Active Learning for Bioacoustic Sound Event Detection
Authors: Shiqi Zhang, Tuomas Virtanen
Abstract: Bioacoustic sound event detection (BioSED) is crucial for biodiversity conservation but faces practical challenges during model development and training: limited amounts of annotated data, sparse events, species diversity, and class imbalance. To address these challenges efficiently with a limited labeling budget, we apply the mismatch-first farthest-traversal (MFFT), an active learning method integrating committee voting disagreement and diversity analysis. We also refine an existing BioSED dataset specifically for evaluating active learning algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that MFFT achieves a mAP of 68% when cold-starting and 71% when warm-starting (which is close to the fully-supervised mAP of 75%) while using only 2.3% of the annotations. Notably, MFFT excels in cold-start scenarios and with rare species, which are critical for monitoring endangered species, demonstrating its practical value.

Title: Efficient and Microphone-Fault-Tolerant 3D Sound Source Localization
Authors: Yiyuan Yang, Shitong Xu, Niki Trigoni, Andrew Markham
Abstract: Sound source localization (SSL) is a critical technology for determining the position of sound sources in complex environments. However, existing methods face challenges such as high computational costs and precise calibration requirements, limiting their deployment in dynamic or resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces a novel 3D SSL framework, which uses sparse cross-attention, pretraining, and adaptive signal coherence metrics, to achieve accurate and computationally efficient localization with fewer input microphones. The framework is also fault-tolerant to unreliable or even unknown microphone position inputs, ensuring its applicability in real-world scenarios. Preliminary experiments demonstrate its scalability for multi-source localization without requiring additional hardware. This work advances SSL by balancing the model's performance and efficiency and improving its robustness for real-world scenarios.

Title: MelodySim: Measuring Melody-aware Music Similarity for Plagiarism Detection
Authors: Tongyu Lu, Charlotta-Marlena Geist, Jan Melechovsky, Abhinaba Roy, Dorien Herremans
Abstract: We propose MelodySim, a melody-aware music similarity model and dataset for plagiarism detection. First, we introduce a novel method to construct a dataset with focus on melodic similarity. By augmenting Slakh2100; an existing MIDI dataset, we generate variations of each piece while preserving the melody through modifications such as note splitting, arpeggiation, minor track dropout (excluding bass), and re-instrumentation. A user study confirms that positive pairs indeed contain similar melodies, with other musical tracks significantly changed. Second, we develop a segment-wise melodic-similarity detection model that uses a MERT encoder and applies a triplet neural network to capture melodic similarity. The resultant decision matrix highlights where plagiarism might occur. Our model achieves high accuracy on the MelodySim test set.

Title: Interference Detection in Spectrum-Blind Multi-User Optical Spectrum as a Service
Authors: Agastya Raj, Daniel C. Kilper, Marco Ruffini
Abstract: With the growing demand for high-bandwidth, low-latency applications, Optical Spectrum as a Service (OSaaS) is of interest for flexible bandwidth allocation within Elastic Optical Networks (EONs) and Open Line Systems (OLS). While OSaaS facilitates transparent connectivity and resource sharing among users, it raises concerns over potential network vulnerabilities due to shared fiber access and inter-channel interference, such as fiber non-linearity and amplifier based crosstalk. These challenges are exacerbated in multi-user environments, complicating the identification and localization of service interferences. To reduce system disruptions and system repair costs, it is beneficial to detect and identify such interferences timely. Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces a Machine Learning (ML) based architecture for network operators to detect and attribute interferences to specific OSaaS users while blind to the users' internal spectrum details. Our methodology leverages available coarse power measurements and operator channel performance data, bypassing the need for internal user information of wide-band shared spectra. Experimental studies conducted on a 190 km optical line system in the Open Ireland testbed, with three OSaaS users demonstrate the model's capability to accurately classify the source of interferences, achieving a classification accuracy of 90.3%.

Title: Text-Queried Audio Source Separation via Hierarchical Modeling
Authors: Xinlei Yin, Xiulian Peng, Xue Jiang, Zhiwei Xiong, Yan Lu
Abstract: Target audio source separation with natural language queries presents a promising paradigm for extracting arbitrary audio events through arbitrary text descriptions. Existing methods mainly face two challenges, the difficulty in jointly modeling acoustic-textual alignment and semantic-aware separation within a blindly-learned single-stage architecture, and the reliance on large-scale accurately-labeled training data to compensate for inefficient cross-modal learning and separation. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical decomposition framework, HSM-TSS, that decouples the task into global-local semantic-guided feature separation and structure-preserving acoustic reconstruction. Our approach introduces a dual-stage mechanism for semantic separation, operating on distinct global and local semantic feature spaces. We first perform global-semantic separation through a global semantic feature space aligned with text queries. A Q-Audio architecture is employed to align audio and text modalities, serving as pretrained global-semantic encoders. Conditioned on the predicted global feature, we then perform the second-stage local-semantic separation on AudioMAE features that preserve time-frequency structures, followed by acoustic reconstruction. We also propose an instruction processing pipeline to parse arbitrary text queries into structured operations, extraction or removal, coupled with audio descriptions, enabling flexible sound manipulation. Our method achieves state-of-the-art separation performance with data-efficient training while maintaining superior semantic consistency with queries in complex auditory scenes.

Title: A domain adaptation neural network for digital twin-supported fault diagnosis
Authors: Zhenling Chen, Haiwei Fu, Zhiguo Zeng
Abstract: Digital twins offer a promising solution to the lack of sufficient labeled data in deep learning-based fault diagnosis by generating simulated data for model training. However, discrepancies between simulation and real-world systems can lead to a significant drop in performance when models are applied in real scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a fault diagnosis framework based on Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN), which enables knowledge transfer from simulated (source domain) to real-world (target domain) data. We evaluate the proposed framework using a publicly available robotics fault diagnosis dataset, which includes 3,600 sequences generated by a digital twin model and 90 real sequences collected from physical systems. The DANN method is compared with commonly used lightweight deep learning models such as CNN, TCN, Transformer, and LSTM. Experimental results show that incorporating domain adaptation significantly improves the diagnostic performance. For example, applying DANN to a baseline CNN model improves its accuracy from 70.00% to 80.22% on real-world test data, demonstrating the effectiveness of domain adaptation in bridging the sim-to-real gap.

Title: Scaling and Prompting for Improved End-to-End Spoken Grammatical Error Correction
Authors: Mengjie Qian, Rao Ma, Stefano Bannò, Kate M. Knill, Mark J.F. Gales
Abstract: Spoken Grammatical Error Correction (SGEC) and Feedback (SGECF) are crucial for second language learners, teachers and test takers. Traditional SGEC systems rely on a cascaded pipeline consisting of an ASR, a module for disfluency detection (DD) and removal and one for GEC. With the rise of end-to-end (E2E) speech foundation models, we investigate their effectiveness in SGEC and feedback generation. This work introduces a pseudo-labelling process to address the challenge of limited labelled data, expanding the training data size from 77 hours to approximately 2500 hours, leading to improved performance. Additionally, we prompt an E2E Whisper-based SGEC model with fluent transcriptions, showing a slight improvement in SGEC performance, with more significant gains in feedback generation. Finally, we assess the impact of increasing model size, revealing that while pseudo-labelled data does not yield performance gain for a larger Whisper model, training with prompts proves beneficial.

Title: Leveraging LLM and Self-Supervised Training Models for Speech Recognition in Chinese Dialects: A Comparative Analysis
Authors: Tianyi Xu, Hongjie Chen, Wang Qing, Lv Hang, Jian Kang, Li Jie, Zhennan Lin, Yongxiang Li, Xie Lei
Abstract: Large-scale training corpora have significantly improved the performance of ASR models. Unfortunately, due to the relative scarcity of data, Chinese accents and dialects remain a challenge for most ASR models. Recent advancements in self-supervised learning have shown that self-supervised pre- training, combined with large language models (LLM), can effectively enhance ASR performance in low-resource scenarios. We aim to investigate the effectiveness of this paradigm for Chinese dialects. Specifically, we pre-train a Data2vec2 model on 300,000 hours of unlabeled dialect and accented speech data and do alignment training on a supervised dataset of 40,000 hours. Then, we systematically examine the impact of various projectors and LLMs on Mandarin, dialect, and accented speech recognition performance under this paradigm. Our method achieved SOTA results on multiple dialect datasets, including Kespeech. We will open-source our work to promote reproducible research

Title: Assessment of L2 Oral Proficiency using Speech Large Language Models
Authors: Rao Ma, Mengjie Qian, Siyuan Tang, Stefano Bannò, Kate M. Knill, Mark J.F. Gales
Abstract: The growing population of L2 English speakers has increased the demand for developing automatic graders for spoken language assessment (SLA). Historically, statistical models, text encoders, and self-supervised speech models have been utilised for this task. However, cascaded systems suffer from the loss of information, while E2E graders also have limitations. With the recent advancements of multi-modal large language models (LLMs), we aim to explore their potential as L2 oral proficiency graders and overcome these issues. In this work, we compare various training strategies using regression and classification targets. Our results show that speech LLMs outperform all previous competitive baselines, achieving superior performance on two datasets. Furthermore, the trained grader demonstrates strong generalisation capabilities in the cross-part or cross-task evaluation, facilitated by the audio understanding knowledge acquired during LLM pre-training.

Title: Model as Loss: A Self-Consistent Training Paradigm
Authors: Saisamarth Rajesh Phaye, Milos Cernak, Andrew Harper
Abstract: Conventional methods for speech enhancement rely on handcrafted loss functions (e.g., time or frequency domain losses) or deep feature losses (e.g., using WavLM or wav2vec), which often fail to capture subtle signal properties essential for optimal performance. To address this, we propose Model as Loss, a novel training paradigm that utilizes the encoder from the same model as a loss function to guide the training. The Model as Loss paradigm leverages the encoder's task-specific feature space, optimizing the decoder to produce output consistent with perceptual and task-relevant characteristics of the clean signal. By using the encoder's learned features as a loss function, this framework enforces self-consistency between the clean reference speech and the enhanced model output. Our approach outperforms pre-trained deep feature losses on standard speech enhancement benchmarks, offering better perceptual quality and robust generalization to both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.

Title: Topological Deep Learning for Speech Data
Authors: Zhiwang Yu
Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) offers novel mathematical tools for deep learning. Inspired by Carlsson et al., this study designs topology-aware convolutional kernels that significantly improve speech recognition networks. Theoretically, by investigating orthogonal group actions on kernels, we establish a fiber-bundle decomposition of matrix spaces, enabling new filter generation methods. Practically, our proposed Orthogonal Feature (OF) layer achieves superior performance in phoneme recognition, particularly in low-noise scenarios, while demonstrating cross-domain adaptability. This work reveals TDA's potential in neural network optimization, opening new avenues for mathematics-deep learning interdisciplinary studies.

Title: Boosting Adversarial Transferability via High-Frequency Augmentation and Hierarchical-Gradient Fusion
Authors: Yayin Zheng, Chen Wan, Zihong Guo, Hailing Kuang, Xiaohai Lu
Abstract: Adversarial attacks have become a significant challenge in the security of machine learning models, particularly in the context of black-box defense strategies. Existing methods for enhancing adversarial transferability primarily focus on the spatial domain. This paper presents Frequency-Space Attack (FSA), a new adversarial attack framework that effectively integrates frequency-domain and spatial-domain transformations. FSA combines two key techniques: (1) High-Frequency Augmentation, which applies Fourier transform with frequency-selective amplification to diversify inputs and emphasize the critical role of high-frequency components in adversarial attacks, and (2) Hierarchical-Gradient Fusion, which merges multi-scale gradient decomposition and fusion to capture both global structures and fine-grained details, resulting in smoother perturbations. Our experiment demonstrates that FSA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various black-box models. Notably, our proposed FSA achieves an average attack success rate increase of 23.6% compared with BSR (CVPR 2024) on eight black-box defense models.

Title: Universal Speech Enhancement with Regression and Generative Mamba
Authors: Rong Chao, Rauf Nasretdinov, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang, Ante Jukić, Szu-Wei Fu, Yu Tsao
Abstract: The Interspeech 2025 URGENT Challenge aimed to advance universal, robust, and generalizable speech enhancement by unifying speech enhancement tasks across a wide variety of conditions, including seven different distortion types and five languages. We present Universal Speech Enhancement Mamba (USEMamba), a state-space speech enhancement model designed to handle long-range sequence modeling, time-frequency structured processing, and sampling frequency-independent feature extraction. Our approach primarily relies on regression-based modeling, which performs well across most distortions. However, for packet loss and bandwidth extension, where missing content must be inferred, a generative variant of the proposed USEMamba proves more effective. Despite being trained on only a subset of the full training data, USEMamba achieved 2nd place in Track 1 during the blind test phase, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse conditions.

Title: Unfolding A Few Structures for The Many: Memory-Efficient Compression of Conformer and Speech Foundation Models
Authors: Zhaoqing Li, Haoning Xu, Xurong Xie, Zengrui Jin, Tianzi Wang, Xunying Liu
Abstract: This paper presents a novel memory-efficient model compression approach for Conformer ASR and speech foundation systems. Our approach features a unique "small-to-large" design. A compact "seed" model containing a few Conformer or Transformer blocks is trained and unfolded many times to emulate the performance of larger uncompressed models with different logical depths. The seed model and many unfolded paths are jointly trained within a single unfolding cycle. The KL-divergence between the largest unfolded and smallest seed models is used in a self-distillation process to minimize their performance disparity. Experimental results show that our foldable model produces ASR performance comparable to individually constructed Conformer and wav2vec2/HuBERT speech foundation models under various depth configurations, while requiring only minimal memory and storage. Conformer and wav2vec2 models with a reduction of 35% and 30% parameters are obtained without loss of performance, respectively.

Title: Towards One-bit ASR: Extremely Low-bit Conformer Quantization Using Co-training and Stochastic Precision
Authors: Zhaoqing Li, Haoning Xu, Zengrui Jin, Lingwei Meng, Tianzi Wang, Huimeng Wang, Youjun Chen, Mingyu Cui, Shujie Hu, Xunying Liu
Abstract: Model compression has become an emerging need as the sizes of modern speech systems rapidly increase. In this paper, we study model weight quantization, which directly reduces the memory footprint to accommodate computationally resource-constrained applications. We propose novel approaches to perform extremely low-bit (i.e., 2-bit and 1-bit) quantization of Conformer automatic speech recognition systems using multiple precision model co-training, stochastic precision, and tensor-wise learnable scaling factors to alleviate quantization incurred performance loss. The proposed methods can achieve performance-lossless 2-bit and 1-bit quantization of Conformer ASR systems trained with the 300-hr Switchboard and 960-hr LibriSpeech corpus. Maximum overall performance-lossless compression ratios of 16.2 and 16.6 times are achieved without a statistically significant increase in the word error rate (WER) over the full precision baseline systems, respectively.

Title: DiMoSR: Feature Modulation via Multi-Branch Dilated Convolutions for Efficient Image Super-Resolution
Authors: M. Akin Yilmaz, Ahmet Bilican, A. Murat Tekalp
Abstract: Balancing reconstruction quality versus model efficiency remains a critical challenge in lightweight single image super-resolution (SISR). Despite the prevalence of attention mechanisms in recent state-of-the-art SISR approaches that primarily emphasize or suppress feature maps, alternative architectural paradigms warrant further exploration. This paper introduces DiMoSR (Dilated Modulation Super-Resolution), a novel architecture that enhances feature representation through modulation to complement attention in lightweight SISR networks. The proposed approach leverages multi-branch dilated convolutions to capture rich contextual information over a wider receptive field while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that DiMoSR outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight methods across diverse benchmark datasets, achieving superior PSNR and SSIM metrics with comparable or reduced computational complexity. Through comprehensive ablation studies, this work not only validates the effectiveness of DiMoSR but also provides critical insights into the interplay between attention mechanisms and feature modulation to guide future research in efficient network design.

Title: Supervised and self-supervised land-cover segmentation & classification of the Biesbosch wetlands
Authors: Eva Gmelich Meijling, Roberto Del Prete, Arnoud Visser
Abstract: Accurate wetland land-cover classification is essential for environmental monitoring, biodiversity assessment, and sustainable ecosystem management. However, the scarcity of annotated data, especially for high-resolution satellite imagery, poses a significant challenge for supervised learning approaches. To tackle this issue, this study presents a methodology for wetland land-cover segmentation and classification that adopts both supervised and self-supervised learning (SSL). We train a U-Net model from scratch on Sentinel-2 imagery across six wetland regions in the Netherlands, achieving a baseline model accuracy of 85.26%. Addressing the limited availability of labeled data, the results show that SSL pretraining with an autoencoder can improve accuracy, especially for the high-resolution imagery where it is more difficult to obtain labeled data, reaching an accuracy of 88.23%. Furthermore, we introduce a framework to scale manually annotated high-resolution labels to medium-resolution inputs. While the quantitative performance between resolutions is comparable, high-resolution imagery provides significantly sharper segmentation boundaries and finer spatial detail. As part of this work, we also contribute a curated Sentinel-2 dataset with Dynamic World labels, tailored for wetland classification tasks and made publicly available.

Title: Efficient Leaf Disease Classification and Segmentation using Midpoint Normalization Technique and Attention Mechanism
Authors: Enam Ahmed Taufik, Antara Firoz Parsa, Seraj Al Mahmud Mostafa
Abstract: Enhancing plant disease detection from leaf imagery remains a persistent challenge due to scarce labeled data and complex contextual factors. We introduce a transformative two-stage methodology, Mid Point Normalization (MPN) for intelligent image preprocessing, coupled with sophisticated attention mechanisms that dynamically recalibrate feature representations. Our classification pipeline, merging MPN with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks, achieves remarkable 93% accuracy while maintaining exceptional class-wise balance. The perfect F1 score attained for our target class exemplifies attention's power in adaptive feature refinement. For segmentation tasks, we seamlessly integrate identical attention blocks within U-Net architecture using MPN-enhanced inputs, delivering compelling performance gains with 72.44% Dice score and 58.54% IoU, substantially outperforming baseline implementations. Beyond superior accuracy metrics, our approach yields computationally efficient, lightweight architectures perfectly suited for real-world computer vision applications.

Title: Towards Robust Automated Perceptual Voice Quality Assessment with Deep Learning
Authors: Whenty Ariyanti, Kuan-Yu Chen, Sabato Marco Siniscalchi, Hsin-Min Wang, Yu Tsao
Abstract: Objective: Perceptual voice quality assessment plays a critical role in diagnosing and monitoring voice disorders by providing standardized evaluation of vocal function. Traditionally, this process relies on expert raters utilizing standard scales, such as the Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice (CAPE-V) and Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, and Strain (GRBAS). However, these metrics are inherently subjective and susceptible to inter-rater variability, motivating the need for automated and objective assessment methods. Methods: We propose Voice Quality Assessment Network (VOQANet), a deep learning-based framework with an attention mechanism that leverages a Speech Foundation Model (SFM) to capture high-level acoustic and prosodic information from raw speech. To enhance robustness and interpretability, we present VOQANet+, which integrates handcrafted acoustic features such as jitter, shimmer, and harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR) with SFM embeddings. Results: Sentence-based input yields stronger performance than vowel-based input, especially at the patient level. VOQANet consistently outperforms baseline methods in RMSE and PCC, while VOQANet+ performs even better and maintains robustness under noisy conditions. Conclusion: Combining SFM embeddings with domain-informed acoustic features improves interpretability and resilience. Significance: VOQANet+ shows strong potential for deployment in real-world and telehealth settings, addressing the limitations of subjective perceptual assessments with an interpretable and noise-resilient solution.

Title: Distribution Bounds on the Conditional ROC in a Poisson Field of Interferers and Clutters
Authors: Gourab Ghatak
Abstract: We present a novel analytical framework to characterize the distribution of the conditional receiver operating characteristic (ROC) in radar systems operating within a realization of a Poisson field of interferers and clutters. While conventional stochastic geometry based studies focus on the distribution of signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR), they fail to capture the statistical variations in detection and false-alarm performance across different network realizations. By leveraging higher-order versions of the Campbell-Mecke theorem and tools from stochastic geometry, we derive closed-form expressions for the mean and variance of the conditional false-alarm probability, and provide tight upper bounds using Cantelli's inequality. Additionally, we present a beta distribution approximation to capture the meta-distribution of the noise and interference power, enabling fine-grained performance evaluation. The results are extended to analyze the conditional detection probability, albeit with simpler bounds. Our approach reveals a new approach to radar design and robust ROC selection, including percentile-level guarantees, which are essential for emerging high-reliability applications. The insights derived here advocate for designing radar detection thresholds and signal processing algorithms based not merely on mean false-alarm or detection probabilities, but on tail behavior and percentile guarantees.

Title: Advanced Signal Analysis in Detecting Replay Attacks for Automatic Speaker Verification Systems
Authors: Lee Shih Kuang
Abstract: This study proposes novel signal analysis methods for replay speech detection in automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems. The proposed methods -- arbitrary analysis (AA), mel scale analysis (MA), and constant Q analysis (CQA) -- are inspired by the calculation of the Fourier inversion formula. These methods introduce new perspectives in signal analysis for replay speech detection by employing alternative sinusoidal sequence groups. The efficacy of the proposed methods is examined on the ASVspoof 2019 \& 2021 PA databases with experiments, and confirmed by the performance of systems that incorporated the proposed methods; the successful integration of the proposed methods and a speech feature that calculates temporal autocorrelation of speech (TAC) from complex spectra strongly confirms it. Moreover, the proposed CQA and MA methods show their superiority to the conventional methods on efficiency (approximately 2.36 times as fast compared to the conventional constant Q transform (CQT) method) and efficacy, respectively, in analyzing speech signals, making them promising to utilize in music and speech processing works.

Title: GigaSpeech 2: An Evolving, Large-Scale and Multi-domain ASR Corpus for Low-Resource Languages with Automated Crawling, Transcription and Refinement
Authors: Yifan Yang, Zheshu Song, Jianheng Zhuo, Mingyu Cui, Jinpeng Li, Bo Yang, Yexing Du, Ziyang Ma, Xunying Liu, Ziyuan Wang, Ke Li, Shuai Fan, Kai Yu, Wei-Qiang Zhang, Guoguo Chen, Xie Chen
Abstract: The evolution of speech technology has been spurred by the rapid increase in dataset sizes. Traditional speech models generally depend on a large amount of labeled training data, which is scarce for low-resource languages. This paper presents GigaSpeech 2, a large-scale, multi-domain, multilingual speech recognition corpus. It is designed for low-resource languages and does not rely on paired speech and text data. GigaSpeech 2 comprises about 30,000 hours of automatically transcribed speech, including Thai, Indonesian, and Vietnamese, gathered from unlabeled YouTube videos. We also introduce an automated pipeline for data crawling, transcription, and label refinement. Specifically, this pipeline involves Whisper for initial transcription, MMS for forced alignment, and multi-dimensional filtering for data quality assurance. A modified Noisy Student Training is developed to further refine flawed pseudo labels iteratively, thereby enhancing model performance. Experimental results on our manually transcribed evaluation set and two public test sets from Common Voice and FLEURS confirm our corpus's high quality and broad applicability. Notably, ASR models trained on GigaSpeech 2 can reduce the word error rate for Thai, Indonesian, and Vietnamese on our challenging and realistic YouTube test set by 25% to 40% compared to Whisper large-v3, with merely 10% model parameters. Furthermore, our ASR models trained on GigaSpeech 2 yield superior performance compared to commercial services. We hope that our newly introduced corpus and pipeline will open a new avenue for low-resource speech recognition and significantly facilitate research in this area.

Title: Beamforming Design for Intelligent Reffecting Surface Aided Near-Field THz Communications
Authors: Chi Qiu, Qingqing Wu, Wen Chen, Meng Hua, Wanming Hao, Mengnan Jian, Fen Hou
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) operating in the terahertz (THz) band has recently gained considerable interest due to its high spectrum bandwidth. Due to the exploitation of large scale of IRS, there is a high probability that the transceivers will be situated within the near-field region of the IRS. Thus, the near-field beam split effect poses a major challenge for the design of wideband IRS beamforming, which causes the radiation beam to deviate from its intended location, leading to significant gain losses and limiting the efficient use of available bandwidths. While delay-based IRS has emerged as a potential solution, current beamforming schemes generally assume unbounded range time delays (TDs). In this letter, we first investigate the near-field beam split issue at the IRS. Then, we extend the piece-wise far-field model to the IRS, based on which, a double-layer delta-delay (DLDD) IRS beamforming scheme is proposed. Specifically, we employ an element-grouping strategy and the TD imposed on each sub-surface of IRS is achieved by a series of TD modules. This method significantly reduces the required range of TDs. Numerical results show that the proposed DLDD IRS beamforming scheme can effectively mitigate the near-field beam split and achieve near-optimal performance.

Title: Robustness to Model Approximation, Model Learning From Data, and Sample Complexity in Wasserstein Regular MDPs
Authors: Yichen Zhou, Yanglei Song, Serdar Yüksel
Abstract: The paper studies the robustness properties of discrete-time stochastic optimal control under Wasserstein model approximation for both discounted cost and average cost criteria. Specifically, we study the performance loss when applying an optimal policy designed for an approximate model to the true dynamics compared with the optimal cost for the true model under the sup-norm-induced metric, and relate it to the Wasserstein-1 distance between the approximate and true transition kernels. A primary motivation of this analysis is empirical model learning, as well as empirical noise distribution learning, where Wasserstein convergence holds under mild conditions but stronger convergence criteria, such as total variation, may not. We discuss applications of the results to the disturbance estimation problem, where sample complexity bounds are given, and also to a general empirical model learning approach, obtained under either Markov or i.i.d. learning settings.

Title: Exploring Out-of-distribution Detection for Sparse-view Computed Tomography with Diffusion Models
Authors: Ezgi Demircan-Tureyen, Felix Lucka, Tristan van Leeuwen
Abstract: Recent works demonstrate the effectiveness of diffusion models as unsupervised solvers for inverse imaging problems. Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) has greatly benefited from these advancements, achieving improved generalization without reliance on measurement parameters. However, this comes at the cost of potential hallucinations, especially when handling out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To ensure reliability, it is essential to study OOD detection for CT reconstruction across both clinical and industrial applications. This need further extends to enabling the OOD detector to function effectively as an anomaly inspection tool. In this paper, we explore the use of a diffusion model, trained to capture the target distribution for CT reconstruction, as an in-distribution prior. Building on recent research, we employ the model to reconstruct partially diffused input images and assess OOD-ness through multiple reconstruction errors. Adapting this approach for sparse-view CT requires redefining the notions of ``input'' and ``reconstruction error''. Here, we use filtered backprojection (FBP) reconstructions as input and investigate various definitions of reconstruction error. Our proof-of-concept experiments on the MNIST dataset highlight both successes and failures, demonstrating the potential and limitations of integrating such an OOD detector into a CT reconstruction system. Our findings suggest that effective OOD detection can be achieved by comparing measurements with forward-projected reconstructions, provided that reconstructions from noisy FBP inputs are conditioned on the measurements. However, conditioning can sometimes lead the OOD detector to inadvertently reconstruct OOD images well. To counter this, we introduce a weighting approach that improves robustness against highly informative OOD measurements, albeit with a trade-off in performance in certain cases.

Title: Resampling Filter Design for Multirate Neural Audio Effect Processing
Authors: Alistair Carson, Vesa Välimäki, Alec Wright, Stefan Bilbao
Abstract: Neural networks have become ubiquitous in audio effects modelling, especially for guitar amplifiers and distortion pedals. One limitation of such models is that the sample rate of the training data is implicitly encoded in the model weights and therefore not readily adjustable at inference. Recent work explored modifications to recurrent neural network architecture to approximate a sample rate independent system, enabling audio processing at a rate that differs from the original training rate. This method works well for integer oversampling and can reduce aliasing caused by nonlinear activation functions. For small fractional changes in sample rate, fractional delay filters can be used to approximate sample rate independence, but in some cases this method fails entirely. Here, we explore the use of real-time signal resampling at the input and output of the neural network as an alternative solution. We investigate several resampling filter designs and show that a two-stage design consisting of a half-band IIR filter cascaded with a Kaiser window FIR filter can give similar or better results to the previously proposed model adjustment method with many fewer filtering operations per sample and less than one millisecond of latency at typical audio rates. Furthermore, we investigate interpolation and decimation filters for the task of integer oversampling and show that cascaded half-band IIR and FIR designs can be used in conjunction with the model adjustment method to reduce aliasing in a range of distortion effect models.

Title: UltraBones100k: A reliable automated labeling method and large-scale dataset for ultrasound-based bone surface extraction
Authors: Luohong Wu, Nicola A. Cavalcanti, Matthias Seibold, Giuseppe Loggia, Lisa Reissner, Jonas Hein, Silvan Beeler, Arnd Viehöfer, Stephan Wirth, Lilian Calvet, Philipp Fürnstahl
Abstract: Ultrasound-based bone surface segmentation is crucial in computer-assisted orthopedic surgery. However, ultrasound images have limitations, including a low signal-to-noise ratio, and acoustic shadowing, which make interpretation difficult. Existing deep learning models for bone segmentation rely primarily on costly manual labeling by experts, limiting dataset size and model generalizability. Additionally, the complexity of ultrasound physics and acoustic shadow makes the images difficult for humans to interpret, leading to incomplete labels in anechoic regions and limiting model performance. To advance ultrasound bone segmentation and establish effective model benchmarks, larger and higher-quality datasets are needed. We propose a methodology for collecting ex-vivo ultrasound datasets with automatically generated bone labels, including anechoic regions. The proposed labels are derived by accurately superimposing tracked bone CT models onto the tracked ultrasound images. These initial labels are refined to account for ultrasound physics. A clinical evaluation is conducted by an expert physician specialized on orthopedic sonography to assess the quality of the generated bone labels. A neural network for bone segmentation is trained on the collected dataset and its predictions are compared to expert manual labels, evaluating accuracy, completeness, and F1-score. We collected the largest known dataset of 100k ultrasound images of human lower limbs with bone labels, called UltraBones100k. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni correction confirmed that the bone alignment after our method significantly improved the quality of bone labeling (p < 0.001). The model trained on UltraBones100k consistently outperforms manual labeling in all metrics, particularly in low-intensity regions (320% improvement in completeness at a distance threshold of 0.5 mm).

Title: Radar Network for Gait Monitoring: Technology and Validation
Authors: Ignacio E. López-Delgado, Víctor Navarro-López, Francisco Grandas-Pérez, Juan I. Godino-Llorente, Jesús Grajal
Abstract: In recent years, radar-based devices have emerged as an alternative approach for gait monitoring. However, the radar configuration and the algorithms used to extract the gait parameters often differ between contributions, lacking a systematic evaluation of the most appropriate setup. Additionally, radar-based studies often exclude motorically impaired subjects, leaving it unclear whether the existing algorithms are applicable to such populations. In this paper, a radar network is developed and validated by monitoring the gait of five healthy individuals and three patients with Parkinson's disease. Six configurations and four algorithms were compared using Vicon as ground-truth to determine the most appropriate solution for gait monitoring. The best results were obtained using only three nodes: two oriented towards the feet and one towards the torso. The most accurate stride velocity and distance in the state of the art were obtained with this configuration. Moreover, we show that analyzing the feet velocity increases the reliability of the temporal parameters, especially with aged or motorically impaired subjects. The contribution is significant for the implementation of radar networks in clinical and domestic environments, as it addresses critical aspects concerning the radar network configuration and algorithms.

Title: Frequency-Aware Masked Autoencoders for Human Activity Recognition using Accelerometers
Authors: Niels R. Lorenzen, Poul J. Jennum, Emmanuel Mignot, Andreas Brink-Kjaer
Abstract: Wearable accelerometers are widely used for continuous monitoring of physical activity. Supervised machine learning and deep learning algorithms have long been used to extract meaningful activity information from raw accelerometry data, but progress has been hampered by the limited amount of labeled data that is publicly available. Exploiting large unlabeled datasets using self-supervised pretraining is a relatively new and underexplored approach in the field of human activity recognition (HAR). We used a time-series transformer masked autoencoder (MAE) approach to self-supervised pretraining and propose two novel spectrogram-based loss functions: the log-scale meanmagnitude (LMM) and log-scale magnitude variance (LMV) losses. We compared these losses with the mean squared error (MSE) loss for MAE training. We leveraged the large unlabeled UK Biobank accelerometry dataset (n = 109k) for pretraining and evaluated downstream HAR performance using a linear classifier in a smaller labelled dataset. We found that pretraining with the LMM loss improved performance compared to an MAE pretrained with the MSE loss, with 12.7% increase in subject-wise F1 score when using linear probing. Compared with a state-of-the-art ResNet-based HAR model, our LMM-pretrained transformer models performed better (+9.8% F1) with linear probing and comparably when fine-tuned using an LSTM classifier. The addition of the LMV to the LMM loss decreased performance compared to the LMM loss alone. These findings establish the LMM loss as a robust and effective method for pretraining MAE models on accelerometer data for HAR and show the potential of pretraining sequence-based models for free-living HAR.

Title: Designing RF-Powered Battery-Less Electronic Shelf Labels With COTS Components
Authors: Jarne Van Mulders, Gilles Callebaut
Abstract: This paper presents a preliminary study exploring the feasibility of designing batteryless electronic shelf labels (ESLs) powered by radio frequency wireless power transfer using commercial off-the-shelf components. The proposed ESL design is validated through a dedicated testbed and involves a detailed analysis of design choices, including energy consumption, energy conversion, and storage solutions. A leaded aluminium electrolytic capacitor is selected as the primary energy storage element, balancing cost and performance while maintaining compactness. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that an ESL can update its display within 4 to 120 minutes, depending on input power and RF frequency, with harvester efficiencies reaching up to 30 %. Challenges such as low harvester efficiency, extended update times, and hardware constraints are identified, highlighting opportunities for future optimizations. This work provides valuable insights into system design considerations for RF-powered ESLs and establishes a foundation for further research in energy-neutral Internet of Things applications.

Title: A Control-Oriented Simplified Single Particle Model with Grouped Parameter and Sensitivity Analysis for Lithium-Ion Batteries
Authors: Feng Guo, Luis D. Couto
Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in transportation, energy storage, and consumer electronics, driving the need for reliable battery management systems (BMS) for state estimation and control. The Single Particle Model (SPM) balances computational efficiency and accuracy but faces challenges in parameter estimation due to numerous parameters. Current SPM models using parabolic approximation introduce intermediate variables and hard to do parameter grouping. This study presents a control-oriented SPM reformulation that employs parameter grouping and parabolic approximation to simplify model parameters while using average and surface lithium-ion concentrations as model output. By parameter grouping, the original 17 parameters were reduced to 9 grouped parameters. The reformulated model achieves a reduced-order ordinary differential equation form while maintaining mathematical accuracy equivalent to the pre-grouped discretized SPM. Through Sobol sensitivity analysis under various current profiles, the grouped parameters were reduced from 9 to 6 highly sensitive parameters. Results demonstrate that estimating these 6 parameters achieves comparable practical accuracy to estimating all 9 parameters, with faster convergence. This control-oriented SPM enhances BMS applications by facilitating state estimation and control while reducing parameter estimation requirements.

Title: Enhanced Prediction Model for Time Series Characterized by GARCH via Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Inference System
Authors: Hongpei Shao, Da-Qing Zhang, Feilong Lu
Abstract: GARCH-type time series (characterized by Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) exhibit pronounced volatility, autocorrelation, and heteroskedasticity. To address these challenges and enhance predictive accuracy, this study introduces a hybrid forecasting framework that integrates the Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Inference System (IT2FIS) with the GARCH model. Leveraging the interval-based uncertainty representation of IT2FIS and the volatility-capturing capability of GARCH, the proposed model effectively mitigates the adverse impact of heteroskedasticity on prediction reliability. Specifically, the GARCH component estimates conditional variance, which is subsequently incorporated into the Gaussian membership functions of IT2FIS. This integration transforms IT2FIS into an adaptive variable-parameter system, dynamically aligning with the time-varying volatility of the target series. Through systematic parameter optimization, the framework not only captures intricate volatility patterns but also accounts for heteroskedasticity and epistemic uncertainties during modeling, thereby improving both prediction precision and model robustness. Experimental validation employs diverse datasets, including air quality concentration, urban traffic flow, and energy consumption. Comparative analyses are conducted against models: the GARCH-Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (GARCH-TSK) model, fixed-variance time series models, the GARCH-Gated Recurrent Unit (GARCH-GRU), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The results indicate that the proposed model achieves superior predictive performance across the majority of test scenarios in error metrics. These findings underscore the effectiveness of hybrid approaches in forecasting uncertainty for GARCH-type time series, highlighting their practical utility in real-world time series forecasting applications.

Title: HWA-UNETR: Hierarchical Window Aggregate UNETR for 3D Multimodal Gastric Lesion Segmentation
Authors: Jiaming Liang, Lihuan Dai, Xiaoqi Sheng, Xiangguang Chen, Chun Yao, Guihua Tao, Qibin Leng, Hongmin Cai, Xi Zhong
Abstract: Multimodal medical image segmentation faces significant challenges in the context of gastric cancer lesion analysis. This clinical context is defined by the scarcity of independent multimodal datasets and the imperative to amalgamate inherently misaligned modalities. As a result, algorithms are constrained to train on approximate data and depend on application migration, leading to substantial resource expenditure and a potential decline in analysis accuracy. To address those challenges, we have made two major contributions: First, we publicly disseminate the GCM 2025 dataset, which serves as the first large-scale, open-source collection of gastric cancer multimodal MRI scans, featuring professionally annotated FS-T2W, CE-T1W, and ADC images from 500 patients. Second, we introduce HWA-UNETR, a novel 3D segmentation framework that employs an original HWA block with learnable window aggregation layers to establish dynamic feature correspondences between different modalities' anatomical structures, and leverages the innovative tri-orientated fusion mamba mechanism for context modeling and capturing long-range spatial dependencies. Extensive experiments on our GCM 2025 dataset and the publicly BraTS 2021 dataset validate the performance of our framework, demonstrating that the new approach surpasses existing methods by up to 1.68\% in the Dice score while maintaining solid robustness. The dataset and code are public via this https URL.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image processing and analysis has important application value in remote sensing, agriculture and environmental monitoring, but its high dimensionality, data redundancy and noise interference etc. bring great challenges to the analysis. Traditional models have limitations in dealing with these complex data, and it is difficult to meet the increasing demand for analysis. In recent years, Diffusion models, as a class of emerging generative approaches, have demonstrated promising capabilities in hyperspectral image (HSI) processing tasks. By simulating the diffusion process of data in time, the Diffusion Model are capable of modeling high-dimensional spectral structures, generate high-quality samples, and achieve competitive performance in spectral-spatial denoising tasks and data enhancement. In this paper, we review the recent research advances in diffusion modeling for hyperspectral image processing and analysis, and discuss its applications in tasks such as high-dimensional data processing, noise removal, classification, and anomaly detection. The performance of diffusion-based models on image processing is compared and the challenges are summarized. It is shown that the diffusion model can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of hyperspectral image analysis, providing a new direction for future research.

Title: U-SAM: An audio language Model for Unified Speech, Audio, and Music Understanding
Authors: Ziqian Wang, Xianjun Xia, Xinfa Zhu, Lei Xie
Abstract: The text generation paradigm for audio tasks has opened new possibilities for unified audio understanding. However, existing models face significant challenges in achieving a comprehensive understanding across diverse audio types, such as speech, general audio events, and music. Furthermore, their exclusive reliance on cross-entropy loss for alignment often falls short, as it treats all tokens equally and fails to account for redundant audio features, leading to weaker cross-modal alignment. To deal with the above challenges, this paper introduces U-SAM, an advanced audio language model that integrates specialized encoders for speech, audio, and music with a pre-trained large language model (LLM). U-SAM employs a Mixture of Experts (MoE) projector for task-aware feature fusion, dynamically routing and integrating the domain-specific encoder outputs. Additionally, U-SAM incorporates a Semantic-Aware Contrastive Loss Module, which explicitly identifies redundant audio features under language supervision and rectifies their semantic and spectral representations to enhance cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that U-SAM consistently outperforms both specialized models and existing audio language models across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, it exhibits emergent capabilities on unseen tasks, showcasing its generalization potential. Code is available (this https URL).

Title: TCSinger 2: Customizable Multilingual Zero-shot Singing Voice Synthesis
Authors: Yu Zhang, Wenxiang Guo, Changhao Pan, Dongyu Yao, Zhiyuan Zhu, Ziyue Jiang, Yuhan Wang, Tao Jin, Zhou Zhao
Abstract: Customizable multilingual zero-shot singing voice synthesis (SVS) has various potential applications in music composition and short video dubbing. However, existing SVS models overly depend on phoneme and note boundary annotations, limiting their robustness in zero-shot scenarios and producing poor transitions between phonemes and notes. Moreover, they also lack effective multi-level style control via diverse prompts. To overcome these challenges, we introduce TCSinger 2, a multi-task multilingual zero-shot SVS model with style transfer and style control based on various prompts. TCSinger 2 mainly includes three key modules: 1) Blurred Boundary Content (BBC) Encoder, predicts duration, extends content embedding, and applies masking to the boundaries to enable smooth transitions. 2) Custom Audio Encoder, uses contrastive learning to extract aligned representations from singing, speech, and textual prompts. 3) Flow-based Custom Transformer, leverages Cus-MOE, with F0 supervision, enhancing both the synthesis quality and style modeling of the generated singing voice. Experimental results show that TCSinger 2 outperforms baseline models in both subjective and objective metrics across multiple related tasks. Singing voice samples are available at this https URL.

Title: DeepCEE: Efficient Cross-Region Model Distributed Training System under Heterogeneous GPUs and Networks
Authors: Jinquan Wang, Xiaojian Liao, Xuzhao Liu, Jiashun Suo, Zhisheng Huo, Chenhao Zhang, Xiangrong Xu, Runnan Shen, Xilong Xie, Limin Xiao
Abstract: Most existing training systems focus on a single region. In contrast, we envision that cross-region training offers more flexible GPU resource allocation and yields significant potential. However, the hierarchical cluster topology and unstable networks in the cloud-edge-end (CEE) environment, a typical cross-region scenario, pose substantial challenges to building an efficient and autonomous model training system. We propose DeepCEE, a geo-distributed model training system tailored for heterogeneous GPUs and networks in CEE environments. DeepCEE adopts a communication-centric design philosophy to tackle challenges arising from slow and unstable inter-region networks. It begins with a heterogeneous device profiler that identifies and groups devices based on both network and compute characteristics. Leveraging device groups, DeepCEE implements compact, zero-bubble pipeline parallelism, automatically deriving optimal parallel strategies. To further adapt to runtime variability, DeepCEE integrates a dynamic environment adapter that reacts to network fluctuations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that DeepCEE achieves 1.3-2.8x higher training throughput compared to widely used and SOTA training systems.

Title: Improving Generative Inverse Design of Rectangular Patch Antennas with Test Time Optimization
Authors: Beck LaBash, Shahriar Khushrushahi, Fabian Ruehle
Abstract: We propose a two-stage deep learning framework for the inverse design of rectangular patch antennas. Our approach leverages generative modeling to learn a latent representation of antenna frequency response curves and conditions a subsequent generative model on these responses to produce feasible antenna geometries. We further demonstrate that leveraging search and optimization techniques at test-time improves the accuracy of the generated designs and enables consideration of auxiliary objectives such as manufacturability. Our approach generalizes naturally to different design criteria, and can be easily adapted to more complex geometric design spaces.

Title: PhySense: Sensor Placement Optimization for Accurate Physics Sensing
Authors: Yuezhou Ma, Haixu Wu, Hang Zhou, Huikun Weng, Jianmin Wang, Mingsheng Long
Abstract: Physics sensing plays a central role in many scientific and engineering domains, which inherently involves two coupled tasks: reconstructing dense physical fields from sparse observations and optimizing scattered sensor placements to observe maximum information. While deep learning has made rapid advances in sparse-data reconstruction, existing methods generally omit optimization of sensor placements, leaving the mutual enhancement between reconstruction and placement on the shelf. To change this suboptimal practice, we propose PhySense, a synergistic two-stage framework that learns to jointly reconstruct physical fields and to optimize sensor placements, both aiming for accurate physics sensing. The first stage involves a flow-based generative model enhanced by cross-attention to adaptively fuse sparse observations. Leveraging the reconstruction feedback, the second stage performs sensor placement via projected gradient descent to satisfy spatial constraints. We further prove that the learning objectives of the two stages are consistent with classical variance-minimization principles, providing theoretical guarantees. Extensive experiments across three challenging benchmarks, especially a 3D geometry dataset, indicate PhySense achieves state-of-the-art physics sensing accuracy and discovers informative sensor placements previously unconsidered.

Title: Single Snapshot Distillation for Phase Coded Mask Design in Phase Retrieval
Authors: Karen Fonseca, Leon Suarez-Rodriguez, Andres Jerez, Felipe Gutierrez-Barragan, Henry Arguello
Abstract: Phase retrieval (PR) reconstructs phase information from magnitude measurements, known as coded diffraction patterns (CDPs), whose quality depends on the number of snapshots captured using coded phase masks. High-quality phase estimation requires multiple snapshots, which is not desired for efficient PR systems. End-to-end frameworks enable joint optimization of the optical system and the recovery neural network. However, their application is constrained by physical implementation limitations. Additionally, the framework is prone to gradient vanishing issues related to its global optimization process. This paper introduces a Knowledge Distillation (KD) optimization approach to address these limitations. KD transfers knowledge from a larger, lower-constrained network (teacher) to a smaller, more efficient, and implementable network (student). In this method, the teacher, a PR system trained with multiple snapshots, distills its knowledge into a single-snapshot PR system, the student. The loss functions compare the CPMs and the feature space of the recovery network. Simulations demonstrate that this approach improves reconstruction performance compared to a PR system trained without the teacher's guidance.

Title: Leveraging Cascaded Binary Classification and Multimodal Fusion for Dementia Detection through Spontaneous Speech
Authors: Yin-Long Liu, Yuanchao Li, Rui Feng, Liu He, Jia-Xin Chen, Yi-Ming Wang, Yu-Ang Chen, Yan-Han Peng, Jia-Hong Yuan, Zhen-Hua Ling
Abstract: This paper presents our submission to the PROCESS Challenge 2025, focusing on spontaneous speech analysis for early dementia detection. For the three-class classification task (Healthy Control, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Dementia), we propose a cascaded binary classification framework that fine-tunes pre-trained language models and incorporates pause encoding to better capture disfluencies. This design streamlines multi-class classification and addresses class imbalance by restructuring the decision process. For the Mini-Mental State Examination score regression task, we develop an enhanced multimodal fusion system that combines diverse acoustic and linguistic features. Separate regression models are trained on individual feature sets, with ensemble learning applied through score averaging. Experimental results on the test set outperform the baselines provided by the organizers in both tasks, demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of our approach.

Title: FlowSE: Efficient and High-Quality Speech Enhancement via Flow Matching
Authors: Ziqian Wang, Zikai Liu, Xinfa Zhu, Yike Zhu, Mingshuai Liu, Jun Chen, Longshuai Xiao, Chao Weng, Lei Xie
Abstract: Generative models have excelled in audio tasks using approaches such as language models, diffusion, and flow matching. However, existing generative approaches for speech enhancement (SE) face notable challenges: language model-based methods suffer from quantization loss, leading to compromised speaker similarity and intelligibility, while diffusion models require complex training and high inference latency. To address these challenges, we propose FlowSE, a flow-matching-based model for SE. Flow matching learns a continuous transformation between noisy and clean speech distributions in a single pass, significantly reducing inference latency while maintaining high-quality reconstruction. Specifically, FlowSE trains on noisy mel spectrograms and optional character sequences, optimizing a conditional flow matching loss with ground-truth mel spectrograms as supervision. It implicitly learns speech's temporal-spectral structure and text-speech alignment. During inference, FlowSE can operate with or without textual information, achieving impressive results in both scenarios, with further improvements when transcripts are available. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowSE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art generative methods, establishing a new paradigm for generative-based SE and demonstrating the potential of flow matching to advance the field. Our code, pre-trained checkpoints, and audio samples are available.

Title: Full LTL Synthesis over Infinite-state Arenas
Authors: Shaun Azzopardi, Luca Di Stefano, Nir Piterman, Gerardo Schneider
Abstract: Recently, interest has increased in applying reactive synthesis to richer-than-Boolean domains. A major (undecidable) challenge in this area is to establish when certain repeating behaviour terminates in a desired state when the number of steps is unbounded. Existing approaches struggle with this problem, or can handle at most deterministic games with Büchi goals. This work goes beyond by contributing the first effectual approach to synthesis with full LTL objectives, based on Boolean abstractions that encode both safety and liveness properties of the underlying infinite arena. We take a CEGAR approach: attempting synthesis on the Boolean abstraction, checking spuriousness of abstract counterstrategies through invariant checking, and refining the abstraction based on counterexamples. We reduce the complexity, when restricted to predicates, of abstracting and synthesising by an exponential through an efficient binary encoding. This also allows us to eagerly identify useful fairness properties. Our discrete synthesis tool outperforms the state-of-the-art on linear integer arithmetic (LIA) benchmarks from literature, solving almost double as many syntesis problems as the current state-of-the-art. It also solves slightly more problems than the second-best realisability checker, in one-third of the time. We also introduce benchmarks with richer objectives that other approaches cannot handle, and evaluate our tool on them.

Title: DYMAG: Rethinking Message Passing Using Dynamical-systems-based Waveforms
Authors: Dhananjay Bhaskar, Xingzhi Sun, Yanlei Zhang, Charles Xu, Arman Afrasiyabi, Siddharth Viswanath, Oluwadamilola Fasina, Maximilian Nickel, Guy Wolf, Michael Perlmutter, Smita Krishnaswamy
Abstract: We present DYMAG, a graph neural network based on a novel form of message aggregation. Standard message-passing neural networks, which often aggregate local neighbors via mean-aggregation, can be regarded as convolving with a simple rectangular waveform which is non-zero only on 1-hop neighbors of every vertex. Here, we go beyond such local averaging. We will convolve the node features with more sophisticated waveforms generated using dynamics such as the heat equation, wave equation, and the Sprott model (an example of chaotic dynamics). Furthermore, we use snapshots of these dynamics at different time points to create waveforms at many effective scales. Theoretically, we show that these dynamic waveforms can capture salient information about the graph including connected components, connectivity, and cycle structures even with no features. Empirically, we test DYMAG on both real and synthetic benchmarks to establish that DYMAG outperforms baseline models on recovery of graph persistence, generating parameters of random graphs, as well as property prediction for proteins, molecules and materials.

Title: A Concentration Bound for TD(0) with Function Approximation
Authors: Siddharth Chandak, Vivek S. Borkar
Abstract: We derive a concentration bound of the type `for all $n \geq n_0$ for some $n_0$' for TD(0) with linear function approximation. We work with online TD learning with samples from a single sample path of the underlying Markov chain. This makes our analysis significantly different from offline TD learning or TD learning with access to independent samples from the stationary distribution of the Markov chain. We treat TD(0) as a contractive stochastic approximation algorithm, with both martingale and Markov noises. Markov noise is handled using the Poisson equation and the lack of almost sure guarantees on boundedness of iterates is handled using the concept of relaxed concentration inequalities.

Title: Autoregressive Speech Synthesis without Vector Quantization
Authors: Lingwei Meng, Long Zhou, Shujie Liu, Sanyuan Chen, Bing Han, Shujie Hu, Yanqing Liu, Jinyu Li, Sheng Zhao, Xixin Wu, Helen Meng, Furu Wei
Abstract: We present MELLE, a novel continuous-valued token based language modeling approach for text-to-speech synthesis (TTS). MELLE autoregressively generates continuous mel-spectrogram frames directly from text condition, bypassing the need for vector quantization, which is typically designed for audio compression and sacrifices fidelity compared to continuous representations. Specifically, (i) instead of cross-entropy loss, we apply regression loss with a proposed spectrogram flux loss function to model the probability distribution of the continuous-valued tokens; (ii) we have incorporated variational inference into MELLE to facilitate sampling mechanisms, thereby enhancing the output diversity and model robustness. Experiments demonstrate that, compared to the two-stage codec language model VALL-E and its variants, the single-stage MELLE mitigates robustness issues by avoiding the inherent flaws of sampling vector-quantized codes, achieves superior performance across multiple metrics, and, most importantly, offers a more streamlined paradigm.

Title: Sentiment Reasoning for Healthcare
Authors: Khai-Nguyen Nguyen, Khai Le-Duc, Bach Phan Tat, Duy Le, Long Vo-Dang, Truong-Son Hy
Abstract: Transparency in AI healthcare decision-making is crucial. By incorporating rationales to explain reason for each predicted label, users could understand Large Language Models (LLMs)'s reasoning to make better decision. In this work, we introduce a new task - Sentiment Reasoning - for both speech and text modalities, and our proposed multimodal multitask framework and the world's largest multimodal sentiment analysis dataset. Sentiment Reasoning is an auxiliary task in sentiment analysis where the model predicts both the sentiment label and generates the rationale behind it based on the input transcript. Our study conducted on both human transcripts and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts shows that Sentiment Reasoning helps improve model transparency by providing rationale for model prediction with quality semantically comparable to humans while also improving model's classification performance (+2% increase in both accuracy and macro-F1) via rationale-augmented fine-tuning. Also, no significant difference in the semantic quality of generated rationales between human and ASR transcripts. All code, data (five languages - Vietnamese, English, Chinese, German, and French) and models are published online: this https URL

Title: Symmetry constrained neural networks for detection and localization of damage in metal plates
Authors: James Amarel, Christopher Rudolf, Athanasios Iliopoulos, John Michopoulos, Leslie N. Smith
Abstract: The present paper is concerned with deep learning techniques applied to detection and localization of damage in a thin aluminum plate. We used data collected on a tabletop apparatus by mounting to the plate four piezoelectric transducers, each of which took turn to generate a Lamb wave that then traversed the region of interest before being received by the remaining three sensors. On training a neural network to analyze time-series data of the material response, which displayed damage-reflective features whenever the plate guided waves interacted with a contact load, we achieved a model that detected with greater than $99\%$ accuracy in addition to a model that localized with $2.58 \pm 0.12$ mm mean distance error. For each task, the best-performing model was designed according to the inductive bias that our transducers were both similar and arranged in a square pattern on a nearly uniform plate.

Title: Exploring the Computational Feasibility of Direct Pseudoinversion of the Encoding Matrix for MR Image Reconstruction (Pinv-Recon)
Authors: Kylie Yeung, Christine Tobler, Rolf F Schulte, Benjamin White, Anthony McIntyre, Sebastien Serres, Peter Morris, Dorothee Auer, Fergus V Gleeson, Damian J Tyler, James T Grist, Florian Wiesinger
Abstract: Image reconstruction in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is fundamentally a linear inverse problem, such that the image can be recovered via explicit pseudoinversion of the encoding matrix by solving $\textbf{data} = \textbf{Encode} \times \textbf{image}$ - a method referred to here as Pinv-Recon. While the benefits of this approach were acknowledged in early studies, the field has historically favored fast Fourier transforms (FFT) and iterative techniques due to perceived computational limitations of the pseudoinversion approach. This work revisits Pinv-Recon in the context of modern hardware, software, and optimized linear algebra routines. We compare various matrix inversion strategies, assess regularization effects, and demonstrate incorporation of advanced encoding physics into a unified reconstruction framework. While hardware advances have already significantly reduced computation time compared to earlier studies, our work further demonstrates that leveraging Cholesky decomposition and block-wise inversion leads to a two-order-of-magnitude improvement in computational efficiency over previous Singular Value Decomposition-based implementations. Moreover, we demonstrate the versatility of Pinv-Recon on diverse \textit{in vivo} datasets encompassing a range of encoding schemes, starting with low- to medium-resolution functional and metabolic imaging and extending to high-resolution cases. Our findings establish Pinv-Recon as a practical and adaptable reconstruction method that aligns with the increasing emphasis on open-source and reproducible MRI research.

Title: Music Foundation Model as Generic Booster for Music Downstream Tasks

Abstract: We demonstrate the efficacy of using intermediate representations from a single foundation model to enhance various music downstream tasks. We introduce SoniDo, a music foundation model (MFM) designed to extract hierarchical features from target music samples. By leveraging hierarchical intermediate features, SoniDo constrains the information granularity, leading to improved performance across various downstream tasks including both understanding and generative tasks. We specifically evaluated this approach on representative tasks such as music tagging, music transcription, music source separation, and music mixing. Our results reveal that the features extracted from foundation models provide valuable enhancements in training downstream task models. This highlights the capability of using features extracted from music foundation models as a booster for downstream tasks. Our approach not only benefits existing task-specific models but also supports music downstream tasks constrained by data scarcity. This paves the way for more effective and accessible music processing solutions.

Title: Align-SLM: Textless Spoken Language Models with Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback
Authors: Guan-Ting Lin, Prashanth Gurunath Shivakumar, Aditya Gourav, Yile Gu, Ankur Gandhe, Hung-yi Lee, Ivan Bulyko
Abstract: While textless Spoken Language Models (SLMs) have shown potential in end-to-end speech-to-speech modeling, they still lag behind text-based Large Language Models (LLMs) in terms of semantic coherence and relevance. This work introduces the Align-SLM framework, which leverages preference optimization inspired by Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) to enhance the semantic understanding of SLMs. Our approach generates multiple speech continuations from a given prompt and uses semantic metrics to create preference data for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We evaluate the framework using ZeroSpeech 2021 benchmarks for lexical and syntactic modeling, the spoken version of the StoryCloze dataset for semantic coherence, and other speech generation metrics, including the GPT4-o score and human evaluation. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for SLMs on most benchmarks, highlighting the importance of preference optimization to improve the semantics of SLMs.

Title: Rician Channel Modelling for Super Wideband MIMO Communications
Authors: Sachitha C. Bandara, Peter J. Smith, Erfan Khordad, Robin Evans, Rajitha Senanayake
Abstract: Recent developments in Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) technology include packing a large number of antenna elements in a compact array to access the bandwidth benefits provided by higher mutual coupling (MC). The resulting super-wideband (SW) systems require a circuit-theoretic framework to handle the MC and channel models which span extremely large bands. Hence, in this paper, we make two key contributions. First, we develop a physically-consistent Rician channel model for use with SW systems. Secondly, we express the circuit-theoretic models in terms of a standard MIMO model, so that insights into the effects of antenna layouts, MC, and bandwidth can be made using standard communication theory. For example, we show the bandwidth widening resulting from the new channel model. In addition, we show that MC distorts line-of-sight paths which has beamforming implications. We also highlight the interaction between spatial correlation and MC and show that tight coupling reduces spatial correlations at low frequencies.

Title: Flexible Multi-Beam Synthesis and Directional Suppression Through Transmissive RIS
Authors: Rujing Xiong, Ke Yin, Jialong Lu, Kai Wan, Tiebin Mi, Robert Caiming Qiu
Abstract: Despite extensive research on reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in recent years, existing beamforming methods still face significant challenges in achieving flexible and robust beam synthesis, which is an essential capability for a wide range of communication scenarios. This paper introduces a Max-min criterion with nonlinear constraints, leveraging optimization techniques to simultaneously enable flexible multi-beam synthesis and directional suppression using transmissive RIS. Firstly, a realistic model grounded in geometrical optics is introduced to characterize the input/output behaviors of transmissive RISs, effectively bridging the gap between explicit beamforming requirements and practical implementations. Subsequently, a highly efficient algorithm for constrained Max-min optimizations involving quadratic forms is developed. By introducing an auxiliary variable and applying the compensated convexity transform, we successfully reformulate the original non-convex problem and obtain the optimal solution iteratively. This approach is readily applicable to a wide range of constrained Max-min optimization problems. Finally, numerical simulations and prototype experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively enhance or selectively suppress signal beams in designated spatial directions, outperforming existing methods in terms of beam control accuracy and robustness. This framework provides valuable insights and references for practical communications applications such as physical layer security and interference mitigation.

Title: Rethinking MUSHRA: Addressing Modern Challenges in Text-to-Speech Evaluation

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in TTS models, a consistent and robust human evaluation framework is still lacking. For example, MOS tests fail to differentiate between similar models, and CMOS's pairwise comparisons are time-intensive. The MUSHRA test is a promising alternative for evaluating multiple TTS systems simultaneously, but in this work we show that its reliance on matching human reference speech unduly penalises the scores of modern TTS systems that can exceed human speech quality. More specifically, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of the MUSHRA test, focusing on its sensitivity to factors such as rater variability, listener fatigue, and reference bias. Based on our extensive evaluation involving 492 human listeners across Hindi and Tamil we identify two primary shortcomings: (i) reference-matching bias, where raters are unduly influenced by the human reference, and (ii) judgement ambiguity, arising from a lack of clear fine-grained guidelines. To address these issues, we propose two refined variants of the MUSHRA test. The first variant enables fairer ratings for synthesized samples that surpass human reference quality. The second variant reduces ambiguity, as indicated by the relatively lower variance across raters. By combining these approaches, we achieve both more reliable and more fine-grained assessments. We also release MANGO, a massive dataset of 246,000 human ratings, the first-of-its-kind collection for Indian languages, aiding in analyzing human preferences and developing automatic metrics for evaluating TTS systems.

Title: Diffusion Predictive Control with Constraints
Authors: Ralf Römer, Alexander von Rohr, Angela P. Schoellig
Abstract: Diffusion models have become popular for policy learning in robotics due to their ability to capture high-dimensional and multimodal distributions. However, diffusion policies are stochastic and typically trained offline, limiting their ability to handle unseen and dynamic conditions where novel constraints not represented in the training data must be satisfied. To overcome this limitation, we propose diffusion predictive control with constraints (DPCC), an algorithm for diffusion-based control with explicit state and action constraints that can deviate from those in the training data. DPCC incorporates model-based projections into the denoising process of a trained trajectory diffusion model and uses constraint tightening to account for model mismatch. This allows us to generate constraint-satisfying, dynamically feasible, and goal-reaching trajectories for predictive control. We show through simulations of a robot manipulator that DPCC outperforms existing methods in satisfying novel test-time constraints while maintaining performance on the learned control task.

Title: UAV-Enabled Secure ISAC Against Dual Eavesdropping Threats: Joint Beamforming and Trajectory Design
Authors: Jianping Yao, Zeyu Yang, Zai Yang, Jie Xu, Tony Q. S. Quek
Abstract: In this work, we study an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled secure integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where a UAV serves as an aerial base station (BS) to simultaneously perform communication with a user and detect a target on the ground, while a dual-functional eavesdropper attempts to intercept the signals for both sensing and communication. Facing the dual eavesdropping threats, we aim to enhance the average achievable secrecy rate for the communication user by jointly designing the UAV trajectory together with the transmit information and sensing beamforming, while satisfying the requirements on sensing performance and sensing security, as well as the UAV power and flight constraints. To address the non-convex nature of the optimization problem, we employ the alternating optimization (AO) strategy, jointly with the successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) methods. Numerical results validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its ability to achieve a high secrecy rate while meeting the required sensing and security constraints.

Title: VoxEval: Benchmarking the Knowledge Understanding Capabilities of End-to-End Spoken Language Models
Authors: Wenqian Cui, Xiaoqi Jiao, Ziqiao Meng, Irwin King
Abstract: With the rising need for speech-based interaction models, end-to-end Spoken Language Models (SLMs) have emerged as a promising solution. While these models require comprehensive world knowledge for meaningful and reliable human interactions, existing question-answering (QA) benchmarks fall short in evaluating SLMs' knowledge understanding due to their inability to support end-to-end speech evaluation and account for varied input audio conditions. To address these limitations, we present VoxEval, a novel SpeechQA benchmark that assesses SLMs' knowledge understanding through pure speech interactions. Our benchmark 1) uniquely maintains speech format for both inputs and outputs, 2) evaluates model robustness across diverse input audio conditions, and 3) pioneers the assessment of complex tasks like mathematical reasoning in spoken format. Systematic evaluation demonstrates that VoxEval presents significant challenges to current SLMs, revealing their sensitivity to varying audio conditions and highlighting the need to enhance reasoning capabilities in future development. We hope this benchmark could guide the advancement of more sophisticated and reliable SLMs. VoxEval dataset is available at: this https URL

Title: Policy Design for Two-sided Platforms with Participation Dynamics
Authors: Haruka Kiyohara, Fan Yao, Sarah Dean
Abstract: In two-sided platforms (e.g., video streaming or e-commerce), viewers and providers engage in interactive dynamics: viewers benefit from increases in provider populations, while providers benefit from increases in viewer population. Despite the importance of such "population effects" on long-term platform health, recommendation policies do not generally take the participation dynamics into account. This paper thus studies the dynamics and recommender policy design on two-sided platforms under the population effects for the first time. Our control- and game-theoretic findings warn against the use of the standard "myopic-greedy" policy and shed light on the importance of provider-side considerations (i.e., effectively distributing exposure among provider groups) to improve social welfare via population growth. We also present a simple algorithm to optimize long-term social welfare by taking the population effects into account, and demonstrate its effectiveness in synthetic and real-data experiments. Our experiment code is available at this https URL.

Title: Global linearization of asymptotically stable systems without hyperbolicity
Authors: Matthew D. Kvalheim, Eduardo D. Sontag
Abstract: We give a proof of an extension of the Hartman-Grobman theorem to nonhyperbolic but asymptotically stable equilibria of vector fields. Moreover, the linearizing topological conjugacy is (i) defined on the entire basin of attraction if the vector field is complete, and (ii) a $C^{k\geq 1}$-diffeomorphism on the complement of the equilibrium if the vector field is $C^k$ and the underlying space is not $5$-dimensional. We also show that the $C^k$ statement in the $5$-dimensional case is equivalent to the $4$-dimensional smooth Poincaré conjecture.

Title: Composable Uncertainty in Symmetric Monoidal Categories for Design Problems
Authors: Marius Furter, Yujun Huang, Gioele Zardini
Abstract: Applied category theory often studies symmetric monoidal categories (SMCs) whose morphisms represent open systems. These structures naturally accommodate complex wiring patterns, leveraging (co)monoidal structures for splitting and merging wires, or compact closed structures for feedback. A key example is the compact closed SMC of design problems (DP), which enables a compositional approach to co-design in engineering. However, in practice, the systems of interest may not be fully known. Recently, Markov categories have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling uncertain processes. In this work, we demonstrate how to integrate this perspective into the study of open systems while preserving consistency with the underlying SMC structure. To this end, we employ the change-of-base construction for enriched categories, replacing the morphisms of a symmetric monoidal $\mathcal{V}$-category $\mathcal{C}$ with parametric maps $A \to \mathcal{C}(X,Y)$ in a Markov category induced by a symmetric monoidal monad. This results in a symmetric monoidal 2-category $N_*\mathcal{C}$ with the same objects as $\mathcal{C}$ and reparametrization 2-cells. By choosing different monads, we capture various types of uncertainty. The category underlying $\mathcal{C}$ embeds into $N_*\mathcal{C}$ via a strict symmetric monoidal functor, allowing (co)monoidal and compact closed structures to be transferred. Applied to DP, this construction leads to categories of practical relevance, such as parametrized design problems for optimization, and parametrized distributions of design problems for decision theory and Bayesian learning.

Title: Structure-Accurate Medical Image Translation via Dynamic Frequency Balance and Knowledge Guidance
Authors: Jiahua Xu, Dawei Zhou, Lei Hu, Zaiyi Liu, Nannan Wang, Xinbo Gao
Abstract: Multimodal medical images play a crucial role in the precise and comprehensive clinical diagnosis. Diffusion model is a powerful strategy to synthesize the required medical images. However, existing approaches still suffer from the problem of anatomical structure distortion due to the overfitting of high-frequency information and the weakening of low-frequency information. Thus, we propose a novel method based on dynamic frequency balance and knowledge guidance. Specifically, we first extract the low-frequency and high-frequency components by decomposing the critical features of the model using wavelet transform. Then, a dynamic frequency balance module is designed to adaptively adjust frequency for enhancing global low-frequency features and effective high-frequency details as well as suppressing high-frequency noise. To further overcome the challenges posed by the large differences between different medical modalities, we construct a knowledge-guided mechanism that fuses the prior clinical knowledge from a visual language model with visual features, to facilitate the generation of accurate anatomical structures. Experimental evaluations on multiple datasets show the proposed method achieves significant improvements in qualitative and quantitative assessments, verifying its effectiveness and superiority.

Title: Efficient LiDAR Reflectance Compression via Scanning Serialization
Authors: Jiahao Zhu, Kang You, Dandan Ding, Zhan Ma
Abstract: Reflectance attributes in LiDAR point clouds provide essential information for downstream tasks but remain underexplored in neural compression methods. To address this, we introduce SerLiC, a serialization-based neural compression framework to fully exploit the intrinsic characteristics of LiDAR reflectance. SerLiC first transforms 3D LiDAR point clouds into 1D sequences via scan-order serialization, offering a device-centric perspective for reflectance analysis. Each point is then tokenized into a contextual representation comprising its sensor scanning index, radial distance, and prior reflectance, for effective dependencies exploration. For efficient sequential modeling, Mamba is incorporated with a dual parallelization scheme, enabling simultaneous autoregressive dependency capture and fast processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SerLiC attains over 2x volume reduction against the original reflectance data, outperforming the state-of-the-art method by up to 22% reduction of compressed bits while using only 2% of its parameters. Moreover, a lightweight version of SerLiC achieves > 10 fps (frames per second) with just 111K parameters, which is attractive for real-world applications.

Title: Multi-Stage Speaker Diarization for Noisy Classrooms
Authors: Ali Sartaz Khan, Tolulope Ogunremi, Ahmed Adel Attia, Dorottya Demszky
Abstract: Speaker diarization, the process of identifying "who spoke when" in audio recordings, is essential for understanding classroom dynamics. However, classroom settings present distinct challenges, including poor recording quality, high levels of background noise, overlapping speech, and the difficulty of accurately capturing children's voices. This study investigates the effectiveness of multi-stage diarization models using Nvidia's NeMo diarization pipeline. We assess the impact of denoising on diarization accuracy and compare various voice activity detection (VAD) models, including self-supervised transformer-based frame-wise VAD models. We also explore a hybrid VAD approach that integrates Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) word-level timestamps with frame-level VAD predictions. We conduct experiments using two datasets from English speaking classrooms to separate teacher vs. student speech and to separate all speakers. Our results show that denoising significantly improves the Diarization Error Rate (DER) by reducing the rate of missed speech. Additionally, training on both denoised and noisy datasets leads to substantial performance gains in noisy conditions. The hybrid VAD model leads to further improvements in speech detection, achieving a DER as low as 17% in teacher-student experiments and 45% in all-speaker experiments. However, we also identified trade-offs between voice activity detection and speaker confusion. Overall, our study highlights the effectiveness of multi-stage diarization models and integrating ASR-based information for enhancing speaker diarization in noisy classroom environments.

Title: Benchmarking Spatiotemporal Reasoning in LLMs and Reasoning Models: Capabilities and Challenges
Authors: Pengrui Quan, Brian Wang, Kang Yang, Liying Han, Mani Srivastava
Abstract: Spatiotemporal reasoning plays a key role in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Despite advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), their capacity to reason about complex spatiotemporal signals remains underexplored. This paper proposes a hierarchical SpatioTemporal reAsoning benchmaRK, STARK, to systematically evaluate LLMs across three levels of reasoning complexity: state estimation (e.g., predicting field variables, localizing and tracking events in space and time), spatiotemporal reasoning over states (e.g., inferring spatial-temporal relationships), and world-knowledge-aware reasoning that integrates contextual and domain knowledge (e.g., intent prediction, landmark-aware navigation). We curate 26 distinct spatiotemporal tasks with diverse sensor modalities, comprising 14,552 challenges where models answer directly or by Python Code Interpreter. Evaluating 3 LRMs and 8 LLMs, we find LLMs achieve limited success in tasks requiring geometric reasoning (e.g., multilateration or triangulation), particularly as complexity increases. Surprisingly, LRMs show robust performance across tasks with various levels of difficulty, often competing or surpassing traditional first-principle-based methods. Our results show that in reasoning tasks requiring world knowledge, the performance gap between LLMs and LRMs narrows, with some LLMs even surpassing LRMs. However, the LRM o3 model continues to achieve leading performance across all evaluated tasks, a result attributed primarily to the larger size of the reasoning models. STARK motivates future innovations in model architectures and reasoning paradigms for intelligent CPS by providing a structured framework to identify limitations in the spatiotemporal reasoning of LLMs and LRMs.

Authors: Yubin Kim, Taehan Kim, Wonjune Kang, Eugene Park, Joonsik Yoon, Dongjae Lee, Xin Liu, Daniel McDuff, Hyeonhoon Lee, Cynthia Breazeal, Hae Won Park
Abstract: Vocal health plays a crucial role in peoples' lives, significantly impacting their communicative abilities and interactions. However, despite the global prevalence of voice disorders, many lack access to convenient diagnosis and treatment. This paper introduces VocalAgent, an audio large language model (LLM) to address these challenges through vocal health diagnosis. We leverage Qwen-Audio-Chat fine-tuned on three datasets collected in-situ from hospital patients, and present a multifaceted evaluation framework encompassing a safety assessment to mitigate diagnostic biases, cross-lingual performance analysis, and modality ablation studies. VocalAgent demonstrates superior accuracy on voice disorder classification compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Its LLM-based method offers a scalable solution for broader adoption of health diagnostics, while underscoring the importance of ethical and technical validation.

Authors: Ming Gao, Shilong Wu, Hang Chen, Jun Du, Chin-Hui Lee, Shinji Watanabe, Jingdong Chen, Siniscalchi Sabato Marco, Odette Scharenborg
Abstract: Meetings are a valuable yet challenging scenario for speech applications due to complex acoustic conditions. This paper summarizes the outcomes of the MISP 2025 Challenge, hosted at Interspeech 2025, which focuses on multi-modal, multi-device meeting transcription by incorporating video modality alongside audio. The tasks include Audio-Visual Speaker Diarization (AVSD), Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR), and Audio-Visual Diarization and Recognition (AVDR). We present the challenge's objectives, tasks, dataset, baseline systems, and solutions proposed by participants. The best-performing systems achieved significant improvements over the baseline: the top AVSD model achieved a Diarization Error Rate (DER) of 8.09%, improving by 7.43%; the top AVSR system achieved a Character Error Rate (CER) of 9.48%, improving by 10.62%; and the best AVDR system achieved a concatenated minimum-permutation Character Error Rate (cpCER) of 11.56%, improving by 72.49%.

Title: Towards Inclusive ASR: Investigating Voice Conversion for Dysarthric Speech Recognition in Low-Resource Languages
Authors: Chin-Jou Li, Eunjung Yeo, Kwanghee Choi, Paula Andrea Pérez-Toro, Masao Someki, Rohan Kumar Das, Zhengjun Yue, Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave, Elmar Nöth, David R. Mortensen
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) for dysarthric speech remains challenging due to data scarcity, particularly in non-English languages. To address this, we fine-tune a voice conversion model on English dysarthric speech (UASpeech) to encode both speaker characteristics and prosodic distortions, then apply it to convert healthy non-English speech (FLEURS) into non-English dysarthric-like speech. The generated data is then used to fine-tune a multilingual ASR model, Massively Multilingual Speech (MMS), for improved dysarthric speech recognition. Evaluation on PC-GITA (Spanish), EasyCall (Italian), and SSNCE (Tamil) demonstrates that VC with both speaker and prosody conversion significantly outperforms the off-the-shelf MMS performance and conventional augmentation techniques such as speed and tempo perturbation. Objective and subjective analyses of the generated data further confirm that the generated speech simulates dysarthric characteristics.

Abstract: We introduces X-ARES (eXtensive Audio Representation and Evaluation Suite), a novel open-source benchmark designed to systematically assess audio encoder performance across diverse domains. By encompassing tasks spanning speech, environmental sounds, and music, X-ARES provides two evaluation approaches for evaluating audio representations: linear fine-tuning and unparameterized evaluation. The framework includes 22 distinct tasks that cover essential aspects of audio processing, from speech recognition and emotion detection to sound event classification and music genre identification. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art audio encoders reveals significant performance variations across different tasks and domains, highlighting the complexity of general audio representation learning.

Title: Joint Magnetometer-IMU Calibration via Maximum A Posteriori Estimation
Authors: Chuan Huang, Gustaf Hendeby, Isaac Skog
Abstract: This paper presents a new approach for jointly calibrating magnetometers and inertial measurement units, focusing on improving calibration accuracy and computational efficiency. The proposed method formulates the calibration problem as a maximum a posteriori estimation problem, treating both the calibration parameters and orientation trajectory of the sensors as unknowns. This formulation enables efficient optimization with closed-form derivatives. The method is compared against two state-of-the-art approaches in terms of computational complexity and estimation accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves lower root mean square error in calibration parameters while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. Further validation through real-world experiments confirms the practical benefits of our approach: it effectively reduces position drift in a magnetic field-aided inertial navigation system by more than a factor of two on most datasets. Moreover, the proposed method calibrated 30 magnetometers in less than 2 minutes. The contributions include a new calibration method, an analysis of existing methods, and a comprehensive empirical evaluation. Datasets and algorithms are made publicly available to promote reproducible research.

Title: CosyVoice 3: Towards In-the-wild Speech Generation via Scaling-up and Post-training
Authors: Zhihao Du, Changfeng Gao, Yuxuan Wang, Fan Yu, Tianyu Zhao, Hao Wang, Xiang Lv, Hui Wang, Chongjia Ni, Xian Shi, Keyu An, Guanrou Yang, Yabin Li, Yanni Chen, Zhifu Gao, Qian Chen, Yue Gu, Mengzhe Chen, Yafeng Chen, Shiliang Zhang, Wen Wang, Jieping Ye
Abstract: In our prior works, we introduced a scalable streaming speech synthesis model, CosyVoice 2, which integrates a large language model (LLM) and a chunk-aware flow matching (FM) model, and achieves low-latency bi-streaming speech synthesis and human-parity quality. Despite these advancements, CosyVoice 2 exhibits limitations in language coverage, domain diversity, data volume, text formats, and post-training techniques. In this paper, we present CosyVoice 3, an improved model designed for zero-shot multilingual speech synthesis in the wild, surpassing its predecessor in content consistency, speaker similarity, and prosody naturalness. Key features of CosyVoice 3 include: 1) A novel speech tokenizer to improve prosody naturalness, developed via supervised multi-task training, including automatic speech recognition, speech emotion recognition, language identification, audio event detection, and speaker analysis. 2) A new differentiable reward model for post-training applicable not only to CosyVoice 3 but also to other LLM-based speech synthesis models. 3) Dataset Size Scaling: Training data is expanded from ten thousand hours to one million hours, encompassing 9 languages and 18 Chinese dialects across various domains and text formats. 4) Model Size Scaling: Model parameters are increased from 0.5 billion to 1.5 billion, resulting in enhanced performance on our multilingual benchmark due to the larger model capacity. These advancements contribute significantly to the progress of speech synthesis in the wild. We encourage readers to listen to the demo at this https URL.
