Title: Fundus2Globe: Generative AI-Driven 3D Digital Twins for Personalized Myopia Management
Authors: Danli Shi, Bowen Liu, Zhen Tian, Yue Wu, Jiancheng Yang, Ruoyu Chen, Bo Yang, Ou Xiao, Mingguang He
Abstract: Myopia, projected to affect 50% population globally by 2050, is a leading cause of vision loss. Eyes with pathological myopia exhibit distinctive shape distributions, which are closely linked to the progression of vision-threatening complications. Recent understanding of eye-shape-based biomarkers requires magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), however, it is costly and unrealistic in routine ophthalmology clinics. We present Fundus2Globe, the first AI framework that synthesizes patient-specific 3D eye globes from ubiquitous 2D color fundus photographs (CFPs) and routine metadata (axial length, spherical equivalent), bypassing MRI dependency. By integrating a 3D morphable eye model (encoding biomechanical shape priors) with a latent diffusion model, our approach achieves submillimeter accuracy in reconstructing posterior ocular anatomy efficiently. Fundus2Globe uniquely quantifies how vision-threatening lesions (e.g., staphylomas) in CFPs correlate with MRI-validated 3D shape abnormalities, enabling clinicians to simulate posterior segment changes in response to refractive shifts. External validation demonstrates its robust generation performance, ensuring fairness across underrepresented groups. By transforming 2D fundus imaging into 3D digital replicas of ocular structures, Fundus2Globe is a gateway for precision ophthalmology, laying the foundation for AI-driven, personalized myopia management.

Title: Synthetic generation of 2D data records based on Autoencoders
Authors: Darius Couchard, Oscar Olarte, Rob Haelterman
Abstract: Gas Chromatography coupled with Ion Mobility Spectrometry (GC-IMS) is a dual-separation analytical technique widely used for identifying components in gaseous samples by separating and analysing the arrival times of their constituent species. Data generated by GC-IMS is typically represented as two-dimensional spectra, providing rich information but posing challenges for data-driven analysis due to limited labelled datasets. This study introduces a novel method for generating synthetic 2D spectra using a deep learning framework based on Autoencoders. Although applied here to GC-IMS data, the approach is broadly applicable to any two-dimensional spectral measurements where labelled data are scarce. While performing component classification over a labelled dataset of GC-IMS records, the addition of synthesized records significantly has improved the classification performance, demonstrating the method's potential for overcoming dataset limitations in machine learning frameworks.

Title: SpeHeatal: A Cluster-Enhanced Segmentation Method for Sperm Morphology Analysis
Authors: Yi Shi, Yunkai Wang, Xupeng Tian, Tieyi Zhang, Bing Yao, Hui Wang, Yong Shao, Cencen Wang, Rong Zeng
Abstract: The accurate assessment of sperm morphology is crucial in andrological diagnostics, where the segmentation of sperm images presents significant challenges. Existing approaches frequently rely on large annotated datasets and often struggle with the segmentation of overlapping sperm and the presence of dye impurities. To address these challenges, this paper first analyzes the issue of overlapping sperm tails from a geometric perspective and introduces a novel clustering algorithm, Con2Dis, which effectively segments overlapping tails by considering three essential factors: CONnectivity, CONformity, and DIStance. Building on this foundation, we propose an unsupervised method, SpeHeatal, designed for the comprehensive segmentation of the SPErm HEAd and TAiL. SpeHeatal employs the Segment Anything Model(SAM) to generate masks for sperm heads while filtering out dye impurities, utilizes Con2Dis to segment tails, and then applies a tailored mask splicing technique to produce complete sperm masks. Experimental results underscore the superior performance of SpeHeatal, particularly in handling images with overlapping sperm.

Title: Observability-Blocking Controls for Double-Integrator and Higher Order Integrator Networks
Authors: Joseph D. Tran, Abdullah Al Maruf
Abstract: The design of state-feedback controls to block observability at remote nodes is studied for double integrator network (DIN) and higher order integrator network models. A preliminary design algorithm is presented first for DIN that requires $m+2$ actuation nodes to block observability for the measurement obtained from a set of $m$ nodes. The algorithm is based on eigenstructure assignment technique and leverages the properties of the eigenvectors in DIN. Next, the topological structure of the network is exploited to reduce the number of controllers required for blocking observability. The number of actuation nodes in sparser design depends on the cardinality of a cutset separating the actuation and measurement locations. Later, the design principles are generalized for blocking observability in $N$-th order integrator network models.

Title: An Uncertainty-Aware Data-Driven Predictive Controller for Hybrid Power Plants
Authors: Manavendra Desai, Himanshu Sharma, Sayak Mukherjee, Sonja Glavaski
Abstract: Given the advancements in data-driven modeling for complex engineering and scientific applications, this work utilizes a data-driven predictive control method, namely subspace predictive control, to coordinate hybrid power plant components and meet a desired power demand despite the presence of weather uncertainties. An uncertainty-aware data-driven predictive controller is proposed, and its potential is analyzed using real-world electricity demand profiles. For the analysis, a hybrid power plant with wind, solar, and co-located energy storage capacity of 4 MW each is considered. The analysis shows that the predictive controller can track a real-world-inspired electricity demand profile despite the presence of weather-induced uncertainties and be an intelligent forecaster for HPP performance.

Title: Denoising Designs-inherited Search Framework for Image Denoising
Authors: Zheyu Zhang, Yueyi Zhang, Xiaoyan sun
Abstract: How to benefit from plenty of existing denoising designs? Few methods via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) intend to answer this question. However, these NAS-based denoising methods explore limited search space and are hard to extend in terms of search space due to high computational burden. To tackle these limitations, we propose the first search framework to explore mainstream denoising designs. In our framework, the search space consists of the network-level, the cell-level and the kernel-level search space, which aims to inherit as many denoising designs as possible. Coordinating search strategies are proposed to facilitate the extension of various denoising designs. In such a giant search space, it is laborious to search for an optimal architecture. To solve this dilemma, we introduce the first regularization, i.e., denoising prior-based regularization, which reduces the search difficulty. To get an efficient architecture, we introduce the other regularization, i.e., inference time-based regularization, optimizes the search process on model complexity. Based on our framework, our searched architecture achieves state-of-the-art results for image denoising on multiple real-world and synthetic datasets. The parameters of our searched architecture are $1/3$ of Restormer's, and our method surpasses existing NAS-based denoising methods by $1.50$ dB in the real-world dataset. Moreover, we discuss the preferences of $\textbf{200}$ searched architectures, and provide directions for further work.

Title: A Note on Structural Controllability and Observability Indices
Authors: Yuan Zhang, Ranbo Cheng, Ziyuan Luo, Yuanqing Xia
Abstract: In this note, we investigate the structural controllability and observability indices of structured systems. We provide counter-examples showing that an existing graph-theoretic characterization for the structural controllability index (SCOI) may not hold, even for systems with self-loop at every state node. We further demonstrate that this characterization actually provides upper bounds, and extend them to new graph-theoretic characterizations applicable to systems that are not necessarily structurally controllable. Additionally, we reveal that an existing method may fail to obtain the exact SCOI. Consequently, complete graph-theoretic characterizations and polynomial-time computation of SCOI remain open. Given this, we present an efficiently computable tight lower bound, whose tightness is validated by numerical simulations. All these results apply to the structural observability index by the duality between controllability and observability.

Title: Deep-Unfolded Massive Grant-Free Transmission in Cell-Free Wireless Communication Systems
Authors: Gangle Sun, Mengyao Cao, Wenjin Wang, Wei Xu, Christoph Studer
Abstract: Grant-free transmission and cell-free communication are vital in improving coverage and quality-of-service for massive machine-type communication. This paper proposes a novel framework of joint active user detection, channel estimation, and data detection (JACD) for massive grant-free transmission in cell-free wireless communication systems. We formulate JACD as an optimization problem and solve it approximately using forward-backward splitting. To deal with the discrete symbol constraint, we relax the discrete constellation to its convex hull and propose two approaches that promote solutions from the constellation set. To reduce complexity, we replace costly computations with approximate shrinkage operations and approximate posterior mean estimator computations. To improve active user detection (AUD) performance, we introduce a soft-output AUD module that considers both the data estimates and channel conditions. To jointly optimize all algorithm hyper-parameters and to improve JACD performance, we further deploy deep unfolding together with a momentum strategy, resulting in two algorithms called DU-ABC and DU-POEM. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed JACD algorithms via extensive system simulations.

Title: Empirical Study of Dynamic Regret in Online Model Predictive Control for Linear Time-Varying Systems
Authors: Nhat M. Nguyen
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a widely used technique for managing timevarying systems, supported by extensive theoretical analysis. While theoretical studies employing dynamic regret frameworks have established robust performance guarantees, their empirical validation remains sparse. This paper investigates the practical applicability of MPC by empirically evaluating the assumptions and theoretical results proposed by Lin et al. [2022]. Specifically, we analyze the performance of online MPC under varying prediction errors and prediction horizons in Linear Time-Varying (LTV) systems. Our study examines the relationship between dynamic regret, prediction errors, and prediction horizons, providing insights into the trade-offs involved. By bridging theory and practice, this work advances the understanding and application of MPC in real-world scenarios.

Title: Uplink Coordinated Pilot Design for 1-bit Massive MIMO in Correlated Channel
Authors: Hyeongtak Yun, Juntaek Han, Kaiming Shen, Jeonghun Park
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a coordinated pilot design method to minimize the channel estimation mean squared error (MSE) in 1-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). Under the assumption that the well-known Bussgang linear minimum mean square error (BLMMSE) estimator is used for channel estimation, we first observe that the resulting MSE leads to an intractable optimization problem, as it involves the arcsin function and a complex multiple matrix ratio form. To resolve this, we derive the approximate MSE by assuming the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, by which we develop an efficient coordinated pilot design based on a fractional programming technique. The proposed pilot design is distinguishable from the existing work in that it is applicable in general system environments, including correlated channel and multi-cell environments. We demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the channel estimation accuracy performance compared to the conventional approaches.

Title: Research on the Offshore Marine Communication Environment Based on Satellite Remote Sensing Data
Authors: Hanyue Ni, Jingsong Yang, Lin Ren, Xiaohui Li, Changming Dong, Wen Chen
Abstract: Air-sea interface fluxes significantly impact the reliability and efficiency of maritime communication. Compared to sparse in-situ ocean observations, satellite remote sensing data offers broader coverage and extended temporal span. This study utilizes COARE V3.5 algorithm to calculate momentum flux, sensible heat flux, and latent heat flux at the air-sea interface, based on satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) wind speed data, reanalysis data, and buoy measurements, combined with neural network methods. Findings indicate that SAR wind speed data corrected via neural networks show improved consistency with buoy-measured wind speeds in flux calculations. Specifically, the bias in friction velocity decreased from -0.03 m/s to 0.01 m/s, wind stress bias from -0.03 N/m^2 to 0.00 N/m^2, drag coefficient bias from -0.29 to -0.21, latent heat flux bias from -8.32 W/m^2 to 5.41 W/m^2, and sensible heat flux bias from 0.67 W/m^2 to 0.06 W/m^2. Results suggest that the neural network-corrected SAR wind speed data can provide more reliable environmental data for maritime communication.

Title: Adopting Whisper for Confidence Estimation
Authors: Vaibhav Aggarwal, Shabari S Nair, Yash Verma, Yash Jogi
Abstract: Recent research on word-level confidence estimation for speech recognition systems has primarily focused on lightweight models known as Confidence Estimation Modules (CEMs), which rely on hand-engineered features derived from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) outputs. In contrast, we propose a novel end-to-end approach that leverages the ASR model itself (Whisper) to generate word-level confidence scores. Specifically, we introduce a method in which the Whisper model is fine-tuned to produce scalar confidence scores given an audio input and its corresponding hypothesis transcript. Our experiments demonstrate that the fine-tuned Whisper-tiny model, comparable in size to a strong CEM baseline, achieves similar performance on the in-domain dataset and surpasses the CEM baseline on eight out-of-domain datasets, whereas the fine-tuned Whisper-large model consistently outperforms the CEM baseline by a substantial margin across all datasets.

Title: Multi-channel Replay Speech Detection using an Adaptive Learnable Beamformer
Authors: Michael Neri, Tuomas Virtanen
Abstract: Replay attacks belong to the class of severe threats against voice-controlled systems, exploiting the easy accessibility of speech signals by recorded and replayed speech to grant unauthorized access to sensitive data. In this work, we propose a multi-channel neural network architecture called M-ALRAD for the detection of replay attacks based on spatial audio features. This approach integrates a learnable adaptive beamformer with a convolutional recurrent neural network, allowing for joint optimization of spatial filtering and classification. Experiments have been carried out on the ReMASC dataset, which is a state-of-the-art multi-channel replay speech detection dataset encompassing four microphones with diverse array configurations and four environments. Results on the ReMASC dataset show the superiority of the approach compared to the state-of-the-art and yield substantial improvements for challenging acoustic environments. In addition, we demonstrate that our approach is able to better generalize to unseen environments with respect to prior studies.

Title: Kernel Mean Embedding Topology: Weak and Strong Forms for Stochastic Kernels and Implications for Model Learning
Authors: Naci Saldi, Serdar Yuksel
Abstract: We introduce a novel topology, called Kernel Mean Embedding Topology, for stochastic kernels, in a weak and strong form. This topology, defined on the spaces of Bochner integrable functions from a signal space to a space of probability measures endowed with a Hilbert space structure, allows for a versatile formulation. This construction allows one to obtain both a strong and weak formulation. (i) For its weak formulation, we highlight the utility on relaxed policy spaces, and investigate connections with the Young narrow topology and Borkar (or \( w^* \))-topology, and establish equivalence properties. We report that, while both the \( w^* \)-topology and kernel mean embedding topology are relatively compact, they are not closed. Conversely, while the Young narrow topology is closed, it lacks relative compactness. (ii) We show that the strong form provides an appropriate formulation for placing topologies on spaces of models characterized by stochastic kernels with explicit robustness and learning theoretic implications on optimal stochastic control under discounted or average cost criteria. (iii) We show that this topology possesses several properties making it ideal to study optimality, approximations, robustness and continuity properties. In particular, the kernel mean embedding topology has a Hilbert space structure, which is particularly useful for approximating stochastic kernels through simulation data.

Title: Binary Deterministic Sensing Matrix Construction Using Manifold Optimization
Authors: Mohamad Mahdi Mohades, Hossein Mohades, S. Fatemeh Zamanian
Abstract: Binary deterministic sensing matrices are highly desirable for sampling sparse signals, as they require only a small number of sum-operations to generate the measurement vector. Furthermore, sparse sensing matrices enable the use of lowcomplexity algorithms for signal reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a method to construct low-density binary deterministic sensing matrices by formulating a manifold-based optimization problem on the statistical manifold. The proposed matrices can be of arbitrary sizes, providing a significant advantage over existing constructions. We also prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm. The proposed binary sensing matrices feature low coherence and constant column weight. Simulation results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing binary sensing matrices in terms of reconstruction percentage and signal to noise ratio (SNR).

Title: Implementation of an IEEE 802.11ax-Based Maritime Mesh Network in the Red Sea
Authors: Yingquan Li, Jiajie Xu, Narek Khachatrian, Mohamed-Slim Alouini
Abstract: In this article, we explore the limitations of satellite phones in meeting the communication needs of fishermen operating in the Red Sea. We propose AX-MMN, a maritime mesh network based on the IEEE 802.11ax standard, to address these shortcomings of satellite phones and outline AX-MMN's system architecture. To validate the performance of AX-MMN, we conduct extensive real-world experiments, demonstrating its potential to enhance maritime connectivity significantly. We also discuss the broader benefits of AX-MMN, particularly for fishermen in underdeveloped East African countries bordering the Red Sea, emphasizing its capacity to improve their communication capabilities and overall quality of life.

Title: RestoreGrad: Signal Restoration Using Conditional Denoising Diffusion Models with Jointly Learned Prior
Authors: Ching-Hua Lee, Chouchang Yang, Jaejin Cho, Yashas Malur Saidutta, Rakshith Sharma Srinivasa, Yilin Shen, Hongxia Jin
Abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) can be utilized for recovering a clean signal from its degraded observation(s) by conditioning the model on the degraded signal. The degraded signals are themselves contaminated versions of the clean signals; due to this correlation, they may encompass certain useful information about the target clean data distribution. However, existing adoption of the standard Gaussian as the prior distribution in turn discards such information, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose to improve conditional DDPMs for signal restoration by leveraging a more informative prior that is jointly learned with the diffusion model. The proposed framework, called RestoreGrad, seamlessly integrates DDPMs into the variational autoencoder framework and exploits the correlation between the degraded and clean signals to encode a better diffusion prior. On speech and image restoration tasks, we show that RestoreGrad demonstrates faster convergence (5-10 times fewer training steps) to achieve better quality of restored signals over existing DDPM baselines, and improved robustness to using fewer sampling steps in inference time (2-2.5 times fewer), advocating the advantages of leveraging jointly learned prior for efficiency improvements in the diffusion process.

Title: Pericoronary adipose tissue attenuation as a predictor of functional severity of coronary stenosis
Authors: Marta Pillitteri, Guido Nannini, Simone Saitta, Luca Mariani, Riccardo Maragna, Andrea Baggiano, Gianluca Pontone, Alberto Redaelli
Abstract: Objective: This study aims to evaluate the functional significance of coronary stenosis by analyzing low-level radiomic features of the pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT) surrounding the lesions, which are indicative of its inflammation status. Methods: A dataset of 72 patients who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) was analyzed, with 3D segmentation and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations from a prior study. Centerlines of the main epicardial branches were automatically extracted, and lesions identified using Gaussian kernel regression to estimate healthy branch caliber. PCAT features were computed per vessel following guideline recommendations and per lesion within a region extending radially for two vessel radii. Features like fat volume and mean attenuation (FAI) were analyzed for their relationship with CFD-derived hemodynamic biomarkers, such as fractional flow reserve (FFR) and wall shear stress (WSS). These features also informed a machine learning (ML) model for classifying potentially ischemic lesions. Results: PCAT exhibited, on average, higher attenuation in the presence of hemodynamically significant lesions (i.e., FFR < 0.80), although this difference was of limited statistical significance. The ML classifier, trained on PCAT features, successfully distinguished potentially ischemic lesions, yielding average accuracy of 0.84. Conclusion: PCAT attenuation is correlated with the functional status of coronary stenosis and can be used to inform ML models for predicting potential ischemia. Significance: PCAT features, readily available from CCTA, can be used to predict the hemodynamic characteristics of a lesion without the need for an invasive FFR examination.

Title: An Adaptive Data-Enabled Policy Optimization Approach for Autonomous Bicycle Control
Authors: Niklas Persson, Feiran Zhao, Mojtaba Kaheni, Florian Dörfler, Alessandro V. Papadopoulos
Abstract: This paper presents a unified control framework that integrates a Feedback Linearization (FL) controller in the inner loop with an adaptive Data-Enabled Policy Optimization (DeePO) controller in the outer loop to balance an autonomous bicycle. While the FL controller stabilizes and partially linearizes the inherently unstable and nonlinear system, its performance is compromised by unmodeled dynamics and time-varying characteristics. To overcome these limitations, the DeePO controller is introduced to enhance adaptability and robustness. The initial control policy of DeePO is obtained from a finite set of offline, persistently exciting input and state data. To improve stability and compensate for system nonlinearities and disturbances, a robustness-promoting regularizer refines the initial policy, while the adaptive section of the DeePO framework is enhanced with a forgetting factor to improve adaptation to time-varying dynamics. The proposed DeePO+FL approach is evaluated through simulations and real-world experiments on an instrumented autonomous bicycle. Results demonstrate its superiority over the FL-only approach, achieving more precise tracking of the reference lean angle and lean rate.

Title: Millimeter-Wave ISAC Testbed Using Programmable Digital Coding Dynamic Metasurface Antenna: Practical Design and Implementation
Authors: Abdul Jabbar, Mostafa Elsayed, Jalil Ur-Rehman Kazim, Zhibo Pang, Julien Le Kernec, Muhammad Imran, Hadi Larijani, Masood Ur-Rehman, Qammer Abbasi, Muhammad Usman
Abstract: Dynamic Metasurface Antennas (DMAs) are transforming reconfigurable antenna technology by enabling energy-efficient, cost-effective beamforming through programmable meta-elements, eliminating the need for traditional phase shifters and delay lines. This breakthrough technology is emerging to revolutionize beamforming for next-generation wireless communication and sensing networks. In this paper, we present the design and real-world implementation of a DMA-assisted wireless communication platform operating in the license-free 60 GHz millimeter-wave (mmWave) band. Our system employs high-speed binary-coded sequences generated via a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), enabling real-time beam steering for spatial multiplexing and independent data transmission. A proof-of-concept experiment successfully demonstrates high-definition quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulated video transmission at 62 GHz. Furthermore, leveraging the DMA's multi-beam capability, we simultaneously transmit video to two spatially separated receivers, achieving accurate demodulation. We envision the proposed mmWave testbed as a platform for enabling the seamless integration of sensing and communication by allowing video transmission to be replaced with sensing data or utilizing an auxiliary wireless channel to transmit sensing information to multiple receivers. This synergy paves the way for advancing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in beyond-5G and 6G networks. Additionally, our testbed demonstrates potential for real-world use cases, including mmWave backhaul links and massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) mmWave base stations.

Title: Hierarchical RL-MPC for Demand Response Scheduling
Authors: Maximilian Bloor, Ehecatl Antonio Del Rio Chanona, Calvin Tsay
Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical framework for demand response optimization in air separation units (ASUs) that combines reinforcement learning (RL) with linear model predictive control (LMPC). We investigate two control architectures: a direct RL approach and a control-informed methodology where an RL agent provides setpoints to a lower-level LMPC. The proposed RL-LMPC framework demonstrates improved sample efficiency during training and better constraint satisfaction compared to direct RL control. Using an industrial ASU case study, we show that our approach successfully manages operational constraints while optimizing electricity costs under time-varying pricing. Results indicate that the RL-LMPC architecture achieves comparable economic performance to direct RL while providing better robustness and requiring fewer training samples to converge. The framework offers a practical solution for implementing flexible operation strategies in process industries, bridging the gap between data-driven methods and traditional control approaches.

Title: Intrinsic Cramér-Rao Bound based 6D Localization and Tracking for 5G/6G Systems
Authors: Xueting Xu, Hui Chen, Shengqiang Shen, Hyowon Kim, Xu Fang, Ao Peng, Fan Jiang, Henk Wymeersch
Abstract: Localization and tracking are critical components of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, enhancing resource management, beamforming accuracy, and overall system reliability through precise sensing. Due to the high path loss of the high-frequency systems, antenna arrays are required at the transmitter and receiver sides for beamforming gain. However, beam misalignment may occur, which requires accurate tracking of the six-dimensional (6D) state, namely, 3D position and 3D orientation. In this work, we first address the challenge that the rotation matrix, being part of the Lie group rather than Euclidean space, necessitates the derivation of the ICRB for an intrinsic performance benchmark. Then, leveraging the derived ICRB, we develop two filters-one utilizing pose fusion and the other employing error-state Kalman filter to estimate the UE's 6D state for different computational resource consumption and accuracy requirements. Simulation results validate the ICRB and assess the performance of the proposed filters, demonstrating their effectiveness and improved accuracy in 6D state tracking.

Abstract: Each year, the European Space Agency (ESA) organizes challenges for university students, from BSc to PhD levels. The ESA Concurrent Engineering Challange 2024 was hosted by four Concurrent Design Facilites (CDF) across Europe: ESEC Galazia, ISAE SUPAERO, the University of Athens, and the University of Portsmouth. A total of 102 students participated in the event. Over five days, students worked on a feasibility study for a space mission, simulating ESA's design session at ESTEC, the ESA headquarters. Students were divided into specializes groups based on their backgrounds, reflecting ESA's concurrent engineering teams. This paper discusses the design of subsystems by students, their trade-off results, and the outcomes of the CDF study. It highlights the effectiveness of concurrent engineering, which enabled rapid and efficient results even from non-esxpert teams. The future development roadmap and lessons learned are also presented. The students used CDP4-Comet software within the replicated ESA CDF, resulting in the PEDRO-V mission proposal: Planetary Exploration Deployment and Research Operation - Venus. The teams collaboratively defined the Concept of Operations, identified actors, worst-case scenarios, use cases, and activities. Their output included a list of requirements, a draft product breakdown structure, and key subsystems information. The concurrent engineering process led to continuous improvement and convergence of key parameters. This approach proved to be effective by aligning different teams' solutions and comparing them to similar missions. The PEDRO-V mission feasibility was confirmed, demonstrating the potential of concurrent engineering in accademic settings for space missions. (summarized with AI)

Title: MGFI-Net: A Multi-Grained Feature Integration Network for Enhanced Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Yucheng Zeng
Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in various clinical applications. A major challenge in medical image segmentation is achieving accurate delineation of regions of interest in the presence of noise, low contrast, or complex anatomical structures. Existing segmentation models often neglect the integration of multi-grained information and fail to preserve edge details, which are critical for precise segmentation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel image semantic segmentation model called the Multi-Grained Feature Integration Network (MGFI-Net). Our MGFI-Net is designed with two dedicated modules to tackle these issues. First, to enhance segmentation accuracy, we introduce a Multi-Grained Feature Extraction Module, which leverages hierarchical relationships between different feature scales to selectively focus on the most relevant information. Second, to preserve edge details, we incorporate an Edge Enhancement Module that effectively retains and integrates boundary information to refine segmentation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGFI-Net not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of segmentation accuracy but also achieves superior time efficiency, establishing it as a leading solution for real-time medical image segmentation.

Title: Generative Video Semantic Communication via Multimodal Semantic Fusion with Large Model
Authors: Hang Yin, Li Qiao, Yu Ma, Shuo Sun, Kan Li, Zhen Gao, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in traditional syntactic communications based on Shannon's theory, these methods struggle to meet the requirements of 6G immersive communications, especially under challenging transmission conditions. With the development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), progress has been made in reconstructing videos using high-level semantic information. In this paper, we propose a scalable generative video semantic communication framework that extracts and transmits semantic information to achieve high-quality video reconstruction. Specifically, at the transmitter, description and other condition signals (e.g., first frame, sketches, etc.) are extracted from the source video, functioning as text and structural semantics, respectively. At the receiver, the diffusion-based GenAI large models are utilized to fuse the semantics of the multiple modalities for reconstructing the video. Simulation results demonstrate that, at an ultra-low channel bandwidth ratio (CBR), our scheme effectively captures semantic information to reconstruct videos aligned with human perception under different signal-to-noise ratios. Notably, the proposed ``First Frame+Desc." scheme consistently achieves CLIP score exceeding 0.92 at CBR = 0.0057 for SNR > 0 dB. This demonstrates its robust performance even under low SNR conditions.

Title: Class E/EF Inductive Power Transfer to Achieve Stable Output under Variable Low Coupling
Authors: Yifan Zhao, Mowei Lu, Heyuan Li, Zhenbin Zhang, Minfan Fu, Stefan M. Goetz
Abstract: This paper develops an inductive power transfer(IPT)system with stable output power based on a Class E/EF inverter. Load-independent design of Class E/EF inverter has recently attracted widespread interest. However, applying this design to IPT systems has proven challenging when the coupling coefficient is weak. To solve this issue, this paper uses an expanded impedance model and substitutes the secondary side's perfect resonance with a detuned design. Therefore, the system can maintain stable output even under a low coupling coefficient. A 400 kHz experimental prototype validates these findings. The experimental results indicate that the output power fluctuation remains within 15% as the coupling coefficient varies from 0.04 to 0.07. The peak power efficiency achieving 91%

Title: Highly Dynamic and Flexible Spatio-Temporal Spectrum Management with AI-Driven O-RAN: A Multi-Granularity Marketplace Framework
Authors: Mehdi Rasti, Elaheh Ataeebojd, Shiva Kazemi Taskooh, Mehdi Monemi, Siavash Razmi, Matti Latva-aho
Abstract: Current spectrum-sharing frameworks struggle with adaptability, often being either static or insufficiently dynamic. They primarily emphasize temporal sharing while overlooking spatial and spectral dimensions. We propose an adaptive, AI-driven spectrum-sharing framework within the O-RAN architecture, integrating discriminative and generative AI (GenAI) to forecast spectrum needs across multiple timescales and spatial granularities. A marketplace model, managed by an authorized spectrum broker, enables operators to trade spectrum dynamically, balancing static assignments with real-time trading. GenAI enhances traffic prediction, spectrum estimation, and allocation, optimizing utilization while reducing costs. This modular, flexible approach fosters operator collaboration, maximizing efficiency and revenue. A key research challenge is refining allocation granularity and spatio-temporal dynamics beyond existing models.

Title: Toeplitz-Hermitian ADMM-Net for DoA Estimation
Authors: Youval Klioui
Abstract: This paper presents Toeplitz-Hermitian ADMM-Net (THADMM-Net), a deep neural network obtained by deep unfolding the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for solving the least absolute shrinkage thresholding operator problem in the context of direction of arrival estimation. By imposing both a Toeplitz-Hermitian as well as positve semi-definite constraint on the learnable matrices, the total parameter count required per layer is reduced from $N^2$ to approximately $N$ where $N$ is the length of the dictionary used in the sparse recovery problem. Numerical simulations show that with a lower parameter count and depth, THADMM-Net outperforms Toeplitz-Lista with respect to the normalized mean-squared error, the detection rate, as well as the root mean-squared error over a signal-to-noise ratio between 0 dB and 35 dB.

Title: Conveniently Identify Coils in Inductive Power Transfer System Using Machine Learning
Authors: Yifan Zhao, Mowei Lu, Ting Chen, Heyuan Li, Xiang Gao, Zhenbin Zhang, Minfan Fu, Stefan M. Goetz
Abstract: High-frequency inductive power transfer (IPT) has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its long transmission distance and high efficiency. The inductance values L and quality factors Q of the transmitting and receiving coils greatly influence the system's operation. Traditional methods involved impedance analyzers or network analyzers for measurement, which required bulky and costly equipment. Moreover, disassembling it for re-measurement is impractical once the product is packaged. Alternatively, simulation software such as HYSS can serve for the identification. Nevertheless, in the case of very high frequencies, the simulation process consumes a significant amount of time due to the skin and proximity effects. More importantly, obtaining parameters through simulation software becomes impractical when the coil design is more complex. This paper firstly employs a machine learning approach for the identification task. We simply input images of the coils and operating frequency into a well-trained model. This method enables rapid identification of the coil's L and Q values anytime and anywhere, without the need for expensive machinery or coil disassembly.

Title: Impact of Optic Nerve Tortuosity, Globe Proptosis, and Size on Retinal Ganglion Cell Thickness Across General, Glaucoma, and Myopic Populations: Insights from the UK Biobank
Authors: Charis Y.N. Chiang, Xiaofei Wang, Stuart K. Gardiner, Martin Buist, Michael J.A. Girard
Abstract: Purpose: To investigate the impact of optic nerve tortuosity (ONT), and the interaction of globe proptosis and globe size on retinal ganglion cell (RGC) thickness, using Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL) thickness, across general, glaucoma, and myopic populations. Methods: We analyzed 17,970 eyes from the UKBiobank cohort (ID 76442), including 371 glaucoma and 2481 myopic eyes. AI models segmented structures from 3D optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans and magnetic resonance images (MRI). RNFL thickness was derived from OCT scans and corrected for ocular magnification, was derived from OCT. From MRIs, we extracted: ONT, globe proptosis, axial length, and a novel interzygomatic line-to-posterior pole (ILPP) distance, a composite marker of globe proptosis and size. GEE models assessed associations between orbital and retinal features across all populations. Results: Segmentation models achieved Dice coefficients over 0.94 for both MRI and OCT. RNFL thickness was positively correlated with both ONT and ILPP distance (r = 0.065, p < 0.001, and r = 0.206, p < 0.001 respectively). The same was true for glaucoma (r = 0.140, p < 0.01, and r = 0.256, p < 0.01), and for myopia (r = 0.071, p < 0.001, and r = 0.100, p < 0.0001). GEE models revealed straighter optic nerves and shorter ILPP distance as predictive of thinner RNFL in all populations. Conclusions: This study emphasizes the impact of ONT, globe size, and proptosis on retinal health, suggesting RNFL thinning may arise from biomechanical stress due to straighter optic nerves or reduced ILPP distance, particularly in glaucoma or myopia. The novel ILPP metric, integrating globe size and position, shows potential as a biomarker for axonal health. These findings highlight the role of orbit structures in RGC axonal health and warrant further exploration of the biomechanical relationship between the orbit and optic nerve.

Title: System-level Analysis of Dual-Mode Networked Sensing: ISAC Integration & Coordination Gains
Authors: Yasser Nabil, Hesham ElSawy, Hossam S. Hassanein
Abstract: This paper characterizes integration and coordination gains in dense millimeter-wave ISAC networks through a dual-mode framework that combines monostatic and multistatic sensing. A comprehensive system-level analysis is conducted, accounting for base station (BS) density, power allocation, antenna misalignment, radar cross-section (RCS) fluctuations, clutter, bistatic geometry, channel fading, and self-interference cancellation (SIC) efficiency. Using stochastic geometry, coverage probabilities and ergodic rates for sensing and communication are derived, revealing tradeoffs among BS density, beamwidth, and power allocation. It is shown that the communication performance sustained reliable operation despite the overlaid sensing functionality. In contrast, the results reveal the foundational role of spatial sensing diversity, driven by the dual-mode operation, to compensate for the weak sensing reflections and vulnerability to imperfect SIC along with interference and clutter. To this end, we identify a system transition from monostatic to multistatic-dominant sensing operation as a function of the SIC efficiency. In the latter case, using six multistatic BSs instead of a single bistatic receiver improved sensing coverage probability by over 100%, highlighting the coordination gain. Moreover, comparisons with pure communication networks confirm substantial integration gain. Specifically, dual-mode networked sensing with four cooperative BSs can double throughput, while multistatic sensing alone improves throughput by over 50%.

Title: Low-Complexity Cooperative Payload Transportation for Nonholonomic Mobile Robots Under Scalable Constraints
Authors: Renhe Guan, Yuanzhe Wang, Tao Liu, Yan Wang
Abstract: Cooperative transportation, a key aspect of logistics cyber-physical systems (CPS), is typically approached using dis tributed control and optimization-based methods. The distributed control methods consume less time, but poorly handle and extend to multiple constraints. Instead, optimization-based methods handle constraints effectively, but they are usually centralized, time-consuming and thus not easily scalable to numerous robots. To overcome drawbacks of both, we propose a novel cooperative transportation method for nonholonomic mobile robots by im proving conventional formation control, which is distributed, has a low time-complexity and accommodates scalable constraints. The proposed control-based method is testified on a cable suspended payload and divided into two parts, including robot trajectory generation and trajectory tracking. Unlike most time consuming trajectory generation methods, ours can generate trajectories with only constant time-complexity, needless of global maps. As for trajectory tracking, our control-based method not only scales easily to multiple constraints as those optimization based methods, but reduces their time-complexity from poly nomial to linear. Simulations and experiments can verify the feasibility of our method.

Title: Unsupervised CP-UNet Framework for Denoising DAS Data with Decay Noise
Authors: Tianye Huang, Aopeng Li, Xiang Li, Jing Zhang, Sijing Xian, Qi Zhang, Mingkong Lu, Guodong Chen, Liangming Xiong, Xiangyun Hu
Abstract: Distributed acoustic sensor (DAS) technology leverages optical fiber cables to detect acoustic signals, providing cost-effective and dense monitoring capabilities. It offers several advantages including resistance to extreme conditions, immunity to electromagnetic interference, and accurate detection. However, DAS typically exhibits a lower signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) compared to geophones and is susceptible to various noise types, such as random noise, erratic noise, level noise, and long-period noise. This reduced S/N can negatively impact data analyses containing inversion and interpretation. While artificial intelligence has demonstrated excellent denoising capabilities, most existing methods rely on supervised learning with labeled data, which imposes stringent requirements on the quality of the labels. To address this issue, we develop a label-free unsupervised learning (UL) network model based on Context-Pyramid-UNet (CP-UNet) to suppress erratic and random noises in DAS data. The CP-UNet utilizes the Context Pyramid Module in the encoding and decoding process to extract features and reconstruct the DAS data. To enhance the connectivity between shallow and deep features, we add a Connected Module (CM) to both encoding and decoding section. Layer Normalization (LN) is utilized to replace the commonly employed Batch Normalization (BN), accelerating the convergence of the model and preventing gradient explosion during training. Huber-loss is adopted as our loss function whose parameters are experimentally determined. We apply the network to both the 2-D synthetic and filed data. Comparing to traditional denoising methods and the latest UL framework, our proposed method demonstrates superior noise reduction performance.

Title: Generative Predictive Control: Flow Matching Policies for Dynamic and Difficult-to-Demonstrate Tasks
Authors: Vince Kurtz, Joel W. Burdick
Abstract: Generative control policies have recently unlocked major progress in robotics. These methods produce action sequences via diffusion or flow matching, with training data provided by demonstrations. But despite enjoying considerable success on difficult manipulation problems, generative policies come with two key limitations. First, behavior cloning requires expert demonstrations, which can be time-consuming and expensive to obtain. Second, existing methods are limited to relatively slow, quasi-static tasks. In this paper, we leverage a tight connection between sampling-based predictive control and generative modeling to address each of these issues. In particular, we introduce generative predictive control, a supervised learning framework for tasks with fast dynamics that are easy to simulate but difficult to demonstrate. We then show how trained flow-matching policies can be warm-started at run-time, maintaining temporal consistency and enabling fast feedback rates. We believe that generative predictive control offers a complementary approach to existing behavior cloning methods, and hope that it paves the way toward generalist policies that extend beyond quasi-static demonstration-oriented tasks.

Title: Probabilistically Robust Uncertainty Analysis and Optimal Control of Continuous Lyophilization via Polynomial Chaos Theory
Authors: Prakitr Srisuma, George Barbastathis, Richard D. Braatz
Abstract: Lyophilization, aka freeze drying, is a process commonly used to increase the stability of various drug products in biotherapeutics manufacturing, e.g., mRNA vaccines, allowing for higher storage temperature. While the current trends in the industry are moving towards continuous manufacturing, the majority of industrial lyophilization processes are still being operated in a batch mode. This article presents a framework that accounts for the probabilistic uncertainty during the primary and secondary drying steps in continuous lyophilization. The probabilistic uncertainty is incorporated into the mechanistic model via polynomial chaos theory (PCT). The resulting PCT-based model is able to accurately and efficiently quantify the effects of uncertainty on several critical process variables, including the temperature, sublimation front, and concentration of bound water. The integration of the PCT-based model into stochastic optimization and control is demonstrated. The proposed framework and case studies can be used to guide the design and control of continuous lyophilization while accounting for probabilistic uncertainty.

Title: MATS: An Audio Language Model under Text-only Supervision
Authors: Wen Wang, Ruibing Hou, Hong Chang, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen
Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs), built upon powerful Large Language Models (LLMs), have exhibited remarkable audio comprehension and reasoning capabilities. However, the training of LALMs demands a large corpus of audio-language pairs, which requires substantial costs in both data collection and training resources. In this paper, we propose MATS, an audio-language multimodal LLM designed to handle Multiple Audio task using solely Text-only Supervision. By leveraging pre-trained audio-language alignment models such as CLAP, we develop a text-only training strategy that projects the shared audio-language latent space into LLM latent space, endowing the LLM with audio comprehension capabilities without relying on audio data during training. To further bridge the modality gap between audio and language embeddings within CLAP, we propose the Strongly-related noisy text with audio (Santa) mechanism. Santa maps audio embeddings into CLAP language embedding space while preserving essential information from the audio input. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MATS, despite being trained exclusively on text data, achieves competitive performance compared to recent LALMs trained on large-scale audio-language pairs.

Title: Semi-supervised classification of bird vocalizations
Authors: Simen Hexeberg, Mandar Chitre, Matthias Hoffmann-Kuhnt, Bing Wen Low
Abstract: Changes in bird populations can indicate broader changes in ecosystems, making birds one of the most important animal groups to monitor. Combining machine learning and passive acoustics enables continuous monitoring over extended periods without direct human involvement. However, most existing techniques require extensive expert-labeled datasets for training and cannot easily detect time-overlapping calls in busy soundscapes. We propose a semi-supervised acoustic bird detector designed to allow both the detection of time-overlapping calls (when separated in frequency) and the use of few labeled training samples. The classifier is trained and evaluated on a combination of community-recorded open-source data and long-duration soundscape recordings from Singapore. It achieves a mean F0.5 score of 0.701 across 315 classes from 110 bird species on a hold-out test set, with an average of 11 labeled training samples per class. It outperforms the state-of-the-art BirdNET classifier on a test set of 103 bird species despite significantly fewer labeled training samples. The detector is further tested on 144 microphone-hours of continuous soundscape data. The rich soundscape in Singapore makes suppression of false positives a challenge on raw, continuous data streams. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that achieving high precision in such environments with minimal labeled training data is possible.

Title: Multi-Target Radar Search and Track Using Sequence-Capable Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Jan-Hendrik Ewers, David Cormack, Joe Gibbs, David Anderson
Abstract: The research addresses sensor task management for radar systems, focusing on efficiently searching and tracking multiple targets using reinforcement learning. The approach develops a 3D simulation environment with an active electronically scanned array radar, using a multi-target tracking algorithm to improve observation data quality. Three neural network architectures were compared including an approach using fated recurrent units with multi-headed self-attention. Two pre-training techniques were applied: behavior cloning to approximate a random search strategy and an auto-encoder to pre-train the feature extractor. Experimental results revealed that search performance was relatively consistent across most methods. The real challenge emerged in simultaneously searching and tracking targets. The multi-headed self-attention architecture demonstrated the most promising results, highlighting the potential of sequence-capable architectures in handling dynamic tracking scenarios. The key contribution lies in demonstrating how reinforcement learning can optimize sensor management, potentially improving radar systems' ability to identify and track multiple targets in complex environments.

Title: User Association and Coordinated Beamforming in Cognitive Aerial-Terrestrial Networks: A Safe Reinforcement Learning Approach
Authors: Zizhen Zhou, Jungang Ge, Ying-Chang Liang
Abstract: Cognitive aerial-terrestrial networks (CATNs) offer a solution to spectrum scarcity by sharing spectrum between aerial and terrestrial networks. However, aerial users (AUs) experience significant interference from numerous terrestrial base stations (BSs). To alleviate such interference, we investigate a user association and coordinated beamforming (CBF) problem in CATN, where the aerial network serves as the primary network sharing its spectrum with the terrestrial network. Specifically, we maximize the sum rate of the secondary terrestrial users (TUs) under the interference temperature constraints of the AUs. Traditional iterative optimization schemes are impractical due to their high computational complexity and information exchange overhead. Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based schemes can address these challenges, their performance is sensitive to the weights of the weighted penalty terms for violating constraints in the reward function. Motivated by these issues, we propose a safe DRL-based user association and CBF scheme for CATN, eliminating the need for training multiple times to find the optimal penalty weight before actual deployment. Specifically, the CATN is modeled as a networked constrained partially observable Markov game. Each TU acts as an agent to choose its associated BS, and each BS acts as an agent to decide its beamforming vectors, aiming to maximize the reward while satisfying the safety constraints introduced by the interference constraints of the AUs. By exploiting a safe DRL algorithm, the proposed scheme incurs lower deployment expenses than the penalty-based DRL schemes since only one training is required before actual deployment. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve a higher sum rate of TUs than a two-stage optimization scheme while the average received interference power of the AUs is generally below the threshold.

Title: TALKPLAY: Multimodal Music Recommendation with Large Language Models
Authors: Seungheon Doh, Keunwoo Choi, Juhan Nam
Abstract: We present TalkPlay, a multimodal music recommendation system that reformulates the recommendation task as large language model token generation. TalkPlay represents music through an expanded token vocabulary that encodes multiple modalities - audio, lyrics, metadata, semantic tags, and playlist co-occurrence. Using these rich representations, the model learns to generate recommendations through next-token prediction on music recommendation conversations, that requires learning the associations natural language query and response, as well as music items. In other words, the formulation transforms music recommendation into a natural language understanding task, where the model's ability to predict conversation tokens directly optimizes query-item relevance. Our approach eliminates traditional recommendation-dialogue pipeline complexity, enabling end-to-end learning of query-aware music recommendations. In the experiment, TalkPlay is successfully trained and outperforms baseline methods in various aspects, demonstrating strong context understanding as a conversational music recommender.

Title: Herglotz-NET: Implicit Neural Representation of Spherical~Data with Harmonic Positional Encoding
Authors: Théo Hanon, Nicolas Mil-Homens Cavaco, John Kiely, Laurent Jacques
Abstract: Representing and processing data in spherical domains presents unique challenges, primarily due to the curvature of the domain, which complicates the application of classical Euclidean techniques. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising alternative for high-fidelity data representation; however, to effectively handle spherical domains, these methods must be adapted to the inherent geometry of the sphere to maintain both accuracy and stability. In this context, we propose Herglotz-NET (HNET), a novel INR architecture that employs a harmonic positional encoding based on complex Herglotz mappings. This encoding yields a well-posed representation on the sphere with interpretable and robust spectral properties. Moreover, we present a unified expressivity analysis showing that any spherical-based INR satisfying a mild condition exhibits a predictable spectral expansion that scales with network depth. Our results establish HNET as a scalable and flexible framework for accurate modeling of spherical data.

Title: Learning to explore when mistakes are not allowed
Authors: Charly Pecqueux-Guézénec, Stéphane Doncieux, Nicolas Perrin-Gilbert
Abstract: Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) provides a versatile framework for developing unified controllers capable of handling wide ranges of tasks, exploring environments, and adapting behaviors. However, its reliance on trial-and-error poses challenges for real-world applications, as errors can result in costly and potentially damaging consequences. To address the need for safer learning, we propose a method that enables agents to learn goal-conditioned behaviors that explore without the risk of making harmful mistakes. Exploration without risks can seem paradoxical, but environment dynamics are often uniform in space, therefore a policy trained for safety without exploration purposes can still be exploited globally. Our proposed approach involves two distinct phases. First, during a pretraining phase, we employ safe reinforcement learning and distributional techniques to train a safety policy that actively tries to avoid failures in various situations. In the subsequent safe exploration phase, a goal-conditioned (GC) policy is learned while ensuring safety. To achieve this, we implement an action-selection mechanism leveraging the previously learned distributional safety critics to arbitrate between the safety policy and the GC policy, ensuring safe exploration by switching to the safety policy when needed. We evaluate our method in simulated environments and demonstrate that it not only provides substantial coverage of the goal space but also reduces the occurrence of mistakes to a minimum, in stark contrast to traditional GCRL approaches. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study and analyze failure modes, offering insights for future research directions.

Title: Audio-Based Classification of Insect Species Using Machine Learning Models: Cicada, Beetle, Termite, and Cricket
Authors: Manas V Shetty, Yoga Disha Sendhil Kumar
Abstract: This project addresses the challenge of classifying insect species: Cicada, Beetle, Termite, and Cricket using sound recordings. Accurate species identification is crucial for ecological monitoring and pest management. We employ machine learning models such as XGBoost, Random Forest, and K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to analyze audio features, including Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). The potential novelty of this work lies in the combination of diverse audio features and machine learning models to tackle insect classification, specifically focusing on capturing subtle acoustic variations between species that have not been fully leveraged in previous research. The dataset is compiled from various open sources, and we anticipate achieving high classification accuracy, contributing to improved automated insect detection systems.

Title: V2C-Long: Longitudinal Cortex Reconstruction with Spatiotemporal Correspondence
Authors: Fabian Bongratz, Jan Fecht, Anne-Marie Rickmann, Christian Wachinger
Abstract: Reconstructing the cortex from longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is indispensable for analyzing morphological alterations in the human brain. Despite the recent advancement of cortical surface reconstruction with deep learning, challenges arising from longitudinal data are still persistent. Especially the lack of strong spatiotemporal point correspondence between highly convoluted brain surfaces hinders downstream analyses, as local morphology is not directly comparable if the anatomical location is not matched precisely. To address this issue, we present V2C-Long, the first dedicated deep learning-based cortex reconstruction method for longitudinal MRI. V2C-Long exhibits strong inherent spatiotemporal correspondence across subjects and visits, thereby reducing the need for surface-based post-processing. We establish this correspondence directly during the reconstruction via the composition of two deep template-deformation networks and innovative aggregation of within-subject templates in mesh space. We validate V2C-Long on two large neuroimaging studies, focusing on surface accuracy, consistency, generalization, test-retest reliability, and sensitivity. The results reveal a substantial improvement in longitudinal consistency and accuracy compared to existing methods. In addition, we demonstrate stronger evidence for longitudinal cortical atrophy in Alzheimer's disease than longitudinal FreeSurfer.

Title: Beam Pattern Modulation Embedded Hybrid Transceiver Optimization for Integrated Sensing and Communication
Authors: Boxun Liu, Shijian Gao, Zonghui Yang, Xiang Cheng, Liuqing Yang
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) emerges as a promising technology for B5G/6G, particularly in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band. However, the widely utilized hybrid architecture in mmWave systems compromises multiplexing gain due to the constraints of limited radio frequency chains. Moreover, additional sensing functionalities exacerbate the impairment of spectrum efficiency (SE). In this paper, we present an optimized beam pattern modulation-embedded ISAC (BPM-ISAC) transceiver design, which spares one RF chain for sensing and the others for communication. To compensate for the reduced SE, index modulation across communication beams is applied. We formulate an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) of the sensing beampattern, subject to a symbol MSE constraint. This problem is then solved by sequentially optimizing the analog and digital parts. Both the multi-aperture structure (MAS) and the multi-beam structure (MBS) are considered for the design of the analog part. We conduct theoretical analysis on the asymptotic pairwise error probability (APEP) and the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) of direction of arrival (DoA) estimation. Numerical simulations validate the overall enhanced ISAC performance over existing alternatives.

Title: Variation Bayesian Interference for Multiple Extended Targets or Unresolved Group Targets Tracking
Authors: Yuanhao Cheng, Yunhe Cao, Tat-Soon Yeo, Yulin Zhang, Fu Jie
Abstract: In this work, we propose a tracking method for multiple extended targets or unresolvable group targets based on the Variational Bayesian Inference (VBI). Firstly, based on the most commonly used Random Matrix Model (RMM), the joint states of a single target are modeled as a Gamma Gaussian Inverse Wishart (GGIW) distribution, and the multi-target joint association variables are involved in the estimation together as unknown information with a prior distribution. A shape evolution model and VBI are employed to address the shortcomings of the RMM. Through the VBI, we can derive the approximate variational posterior for the exact multi-target posterior. Furthermore, to demonstrate the applicability of the method in real-world tracking scenarios, we present two potential lightweight schemes. The first is based on clustering, which effectively prunes the joint association events. The second is a simplification of the variational posterior through marginal association probabilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using simulation experiments, and the proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and adaptability. This manuscript is only a preprint version, a completer and more official version will be uploaded as soon as possible

Title: Chirped DFT-s-OFDM: A new single-carrier waveform with enhanced LMMSE noise suppression
Authors: Yujie Liu, Yong Liang Guan, David González G., Halim Yanikomeroglu
Abstract: In this paper, a new single-carrier waveform, called chirped discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM), is proposed for the sixth generation of communications. As the initial study on this waveform, its performance is analyzed and evaluated in single-user uplink multiple access communications, using a delay-Doppler channel model with independent and identically distributed path amplitudes and different integer delays. By chirping DFT-s-OFDM in the time domain, it maintains the low peak-to-average-power ratio of DFT-s-OFDM. Thanks to full-band transmission and symbols retransmission enabled by chirping and discrete Fourier transform precoding, it enhances noise suppression of linear minimum mean square error equalization. By using pairwise error probability analysis, the derived bit error rate upper bound is close to the simulated ones and the diversity order analysis confirms that it achieves full frequency diversity.

Title: Practical Challenges for Reliable RIS Deployment in Heterogeneous Multi-Operator Multi-Band Networks
Authors: Mehdi Monemi, Mehdi Rasti, Arthur S. de Sena, Mohammad Amir Fallah, Matti Latva-Aho, Marco Di Renzo
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been introduced as arrays of nearly passive elements with software-tunable electromagnetic properties to dynamically manipulate the reflection/transmission of radio signals. Research works in this area are focused on two applications, namely {\it user-assist} RIS aiming at tuning the RIS to enhance the quality-of-service (QoS) of target users, and the {\it malicious} RIS aiming for an attacker to degrade the QoS at victim receivers through generating {\it intended} destructive interference. While both user-assist and malicious RIS applications have been explored extensively, the impact of RIS deployments on imposing {\it unintended} interference on various wireless user-equipments (EUs) remains underexplored. This paper investigates the challenges of integrating RISs into multi-carrier, multi-user, and multi-operator networks. We discuss how RIS deployments intended to benefit specific users can negatively impact other users served at various carrier frequencies through different network operators. While not an ideal solution, we discuss how ultra-narrowband metasurfaces can be incorporated into the manufacturing of RISs to mitigate some challenges of RIS deployment in wireless networks. We also present a simulation scenario to illuminate some practical challenges associated with the deployment of RISs in shared public environments.

Title: Covert Communications Without Pre-Sharing of Side Information and Channel Estimation Over Quasi-Static Fading Channels
Authors: Hiroki Fukada, Hiroki Iimori, Chandan Pradhan, Szabolcs Malomsoky, Naoki Ishikawa
Abstract: We propose a new covert communication scheme that operates without pre-sharing side information and channel estimation, utilizing a Gaussian-distributed Grassmann constellation for noncoherent detection. By designing constant-amplitude symbols on the Grassmann manifold and multiplying them by random variables, we generate signals that follow an arbitrary probability distribution, such as Gaussian or skew-normal distributions. The mathematical property of the manifold enables the transmitter's random variables to remain unshared with the receiver, and the elimination of pilot symbols that could compromise covertness. The proposed scheme achieved higher covertness and achievable rates compared to conventional coherent Gaussian signaling schemes, without any penalty in terms of complexity.

Title: BUPTCMCC-6G-CMG+: A GBSM-Based ISAC Standard Channel Model Generator
Authors: Changsheng Zhao, Jianhua Zhang, Yuxiang Zhang, Lei Tian, Heng Wang, Hanyuan Jiang, Yameng Liu, Wenjun Chen, Tao Jiang, Guangyi Liu
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been recognized as the key technology in the vision of the sixth generation (6G) era. With the emergence of new concepts in mobile communications, the channel model is the prerequisite for system design and performance evaluation. Currently, 3GPP Release 19 is advancing the standardization of ISAC channel models. Nevertheless, a unified modeling framework has yet to be established. This paper provides a simulation diagram of ISAC channel modeling extended based on the Geometry-Based Stochastic Model (GBSM), compatible with existing 5G channel models and the latest progress in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standardization. We first introduce the progress of the ISAC channel model standardization in general. Then, a concatenated channel modeling approach is presented considering the team's standardization proposals, which is implemented on the BUPTCMCC-6G-CMG+ channel model generator. We validated the model in cumulative probability density function (CDF) in statistical extension of angle and delay, and radar cross section (RCS). Simulation results show that the proposed model can realistically characterize the feature of channel concatenation and RCS within the ISAC channel.

Title: Collision Avoidance for Convex Primitives via Differentiable Optimization Based High-Order Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Shiqing Wei, Rooholla Khorrambakht, Prashanth Krishnamurthy, Vinicius Mariano Gonçalves, Farshad Khorrami
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of dynamical systems is crucial, where collision avoidance is a primary concern. Recently, control barrier functions (CBFs) have emerged as an effective method to integrate safety constraints into control synthesis through optimization techniques. However, challenges persist when dealing with convex primitives and tasks requiring torque control, as well as the occurrence of unintended equilibria. This work addresses these challenges by introducing a high-order CBF (HOCBF) framework for collision avoidance among convex primitives. We transform nonconvex safety constraints into linear constraints by differentiable optimization and prove the high-order continuous differentiability. Then, we employ HOCBFs to accommodate torque control, enabling tasks involving forces or high dynamics. Additionally, we analyze the issue of spurious equilibria in high-order cases and propose a circulation mechanism to prevent the undesired equilibria on the boundary of the safe set. Finally, we validate our framework with three experiments on the Franka Research 3 robotic manipulator, demonstrating successful collision avoidance and the efficacy of the circulation mechanism.

Title: Advancing Multi-Connectivity in Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks: Architectures, Challenges, and Applications
Authors: Xiangyu Li, Bodong Shang
Abstract: Multi-connectivity (MC) in satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs), included in the Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards, is regarded as a promising technology for future networks, especially the non-terrestrial network (NTN). The significant advantages of MC in improving coverage, communication, and sensing through satellite-terrestrial collaboration have sparked widespread interest. This article introduces three fundamental deployment architectures of MC systems in STINs, including multi-satellite, single-satellite single-base-station, and multi-satellite multi-base-station configurations. Considering the emerging but still evolving satellite networking, we explore system design challenges such as satellite networking schemes, such as cell-free and multi-tier satellite networks. Subsequently, key technical challenges severely influencing the quality of mutual communications, including beamforming, channel estimation, and synchronization, are discussed. Furthermore, typical applications such as coverage enhancement, traffic offloading, collaborative sensing, and low-altitude communication are demonstrated, followed by a case study comparing coverage performance in MC and single-connectivity (SC) configurations. Several essential future research directions for MC in STINs are presented to facilitate further exploration.

Title: MSEMG: Surface Electromyography Denoising with a Mamba-based Efficient Network
Authors: Yu-Tung Liu, Kuan-Chen Wang, Rong Chao, Sabato Marco Siniscalchi, Ping-Cheng Yeh, Yu Tsao
Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) recordings can be contaminated by electrocardiogram (ECG) signals when the monitored muscle is closed to the heart. Traditional signal processing-based approaches, such as high-pass filtering and template subtraction, have been used to remove ECG interference but are often limited in their effectiveness. Recently, neural network-based methods have shown greater promise for sEMG denoising, but they still struggle to balance both efficiency and effectiveness. In this study, we introduce MSEMG, a novel system that integrates the Mamba state space model with a convolutional neural network to serve as a lightweight sEMG denoising model. We evaluated MSEMG using sEMG data from the Non-Invasive Adaptive Prosthetics database and ECG signals from the MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database. The results show that MSEMG outperforms existing methods, generating higher-quality sEMG signals using fewer parameters.

Title: Computation-and-Communication Efficient Coordinated Multicast Beamforming in Massive MIMO Networks
Authors: Shiqi Yin, Min Dong
Abstract: The main challenges in designing downlink coordinated multicast beamforming in massive multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) cellular networks are the complex computational solutions and significant fronthaul overhead for centralized coordination. This paper proposes a coordinated multicast beamforming solution that is both computation and communication efficient. For joint BS coordination with individual base station transmit power budgets, we first obtain the optimal structure of coordinated multicast beamforming. It reveals that the beamformer at each BS is naturally distributed and only depends on the local channel state information (CSI) at its serving BS. Moreover, the optimal beamformer is a weighted minimum mean square error (MMSE) beamformer with a low-dimensional structure of unknown weights to be optimized, independent of the number of BS antennas. Utilizing the optimal structural properties, we propose fast algorithms to determine the unknown parameters for the optimal beamformer. The main iterative algorithm decomposes the problem into small subproblems, yielding only closed/semi-closed form updates. Furthermore, we propose a semi-distributed computing approach for the proposed algorithm that allows each BS to compute its beamformer based on the local CSI without the need for global CSI sharing, resulting in the fronthaul overhead independent of the number of BS antennas. We further extend our results to the design under the imperfect CSI and other coordination scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed methods can achieve near-optimal performance with significantly lower computational time for massive MIMO systems than the conventional approaches.

Title: Rethink Delay Doppler Channels and Time-Frequency Coding
Authors: Xiang-Gen Xia
Abstract: In this paper, we rethink delay Doppler channels (also called doubly selective channels). We prove that no modulation schemes (including the current active VOFDM/OTFS) can compensate a non-trivial Doppler spread well. We then discuss some of the existing methods to deal with time-varying channels, in particular time-frequency (TF) coding in an OFDM system. TF coding is equivalent to space-time coding in the math part. We also summarize state of the art on space-time coding that was an active research topic over a decade ago.

Title: Weather-Driven Priority Charging for Battery Storage Systems in Hybrid Renewable Energy Grids
Authors: Dhrumil Bhatt, Siddharth Penumatsa, Nirbhay Singhal
Abstract: The integration of renewable energy into the power grid is often hindered by its fragmented infrastructure, leading to inefficient utilization due to the variability of energy production and its reliance on weather conditions. Battery storage systems, while essential for stabilizing energy supply, face challenges like sub-optimal energy distribution, accelerating battery degradation, and reducing operational efficiency. This paper presents a novel solution to these challenges by developing a large-scale, interconnected renewable energy network that optimizes energy storage and distribution. The proposed system includes strategically placed battery storage facilities that stabilize energy production by compensating for fluctuations in renewable output. A priority charging algorithm, informed by real-time weather forecasting and load monitoring, ensures that the most suitable battery systems are charged under varying conditions. Within each storage facility, a secondary priority charging algorithm minimizes battery degradation by ranking batteries based on critical parameters such as state of health (SoH) and state of charge (SoC) and deciding which to charge. This comprehensive approach enhances the efficiency and longevity of battery storage systems, offering a more reliable and resilient renewable energy infrastructure.

Abstract: This paper proposes an RSS-based approach to reconstruct vehicle trajectories within a road network, enforcing signal propagation rules and vehicle mobility constraints to mitigate the impact of RSS noise and sparsity. The key challenge lies in leveraging latent spatiotemporal correlations within RSS data while navigating complex road networks. To address this, we develop a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based RSS embedding (HRE) technique that employs alternating optimization to infer vehicle trajectories from RSS measurements. This model captures spatiotemporal dependencies while a road graph ensures network compliance. Additionally, we introduce a maximum speed-constrained rough trajectory estimation (MSR) method to guide the optimization process, enabling rapid convergence to a favorable local solution.

Title: FreqPrior: Improving Video Diffusion Models with Frequency Filtering Gaussian Noise
Authors: Yunlong Yuan, Yuanfan Guo, Chunwei Wang, Wei Zhang, Hang Xu, Li Zhang
Abstract: Text-driven video generation has advanced significantly due to developments in diffusion models. Beyond the training and sampling phases, recent studies have investigated noise priors of diffusion models, as improved noise priors yield better generation results. One recent approach employs the Fourier transform to manipulate noise, marking the initial exploration of frequency operations in this context. However, it often generates videos that lack motion dynamics and imaging details. In this work, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the variance decay issue present in existing methods, contributing to the loss of details and motion dynamics. Recognizing the critical impact of noise distribution on generation quality, we introduce FreqPrior, a novel noise initialization strategy that refines noise in the frequency domain. Our method features a novel filtering technique designed to address different frequency signals while maintaining the noise prior distribution that closely approximates a standard Gaussian distribution. Additionally, we propose a partial sampling process by perturbing the latent at an intermediate timestep during finding the noise prior, significantly reducing inference time without compromising quality. Extensive experiments on VBench demonstrate that our method achieves the highest scores in both quality and semantic assessments, resulting in the best overall total score. These results highlight the superiority of our proposed noise prior.

Title: An Attention-Assisted AI Model for Real-Time Underwater Sound Speed Estimation Leveraging Remote Sensing Sea Surface Temperature Data
Authors: Pengfei Wu, Wei Huang, Yujie Shi, Hao Zhang
Abstract: The estimation of underwater sound velocity distribution serves as a critical basis for facilitating effective underwater communication and precise positioning, given that variations in sound velocity influence the path of signal transmission. Conventional techniques for the direct measurement of sound velocity, as well as methods that involve the inversion of sound velocity utilizing acoustic field data, necessitate on--site data collection. This requirement not only places high demands on device deployment, but also presents challenges in achieving real-time estimation of sound velocity distribution. In order to construct a real-time sound velocity field and eliminate the need for underwater onsite data measurement operations, we propose a self-attention embedded multimodal data fusion convolutional neural network (SA-MDF-CNN) for real-time underwater sound speed profile (SSP) estimation. The proposed model seeks to elucidate the inherent relationship between remote sensing sea surface temperature (SST) data, the primary component characteristics of historical SSPs, and their spatial coordinates. This is achieved by employing CNNs and attention mechanisms to extract local and global correlations from the input data, respectively. The ultimate objective is to facilitate a rapid and precise estimation of sound velocity distribution within a specified task area. Experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper has lower root mean square error (RMSE) and stronger robustness than other state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Artificial Intelligence-derived Vascular Age from Photoplethysmography: A Novel Digital Biomarker for Cardiovascular Health
Authors: Guangkun Nie, Qinghao Zhao, Gongzheng Tang, Yaxin Li, Shenda Hong
Abstract: With the increasing availability of wearable devices, photoplethysmography (PPG) has emerged as a promising non-invasive tool for monitoring human hemodynamics. We propose a deep learning framework to estimate vascular age (AI-vascular age) from PPG signals, incorporating a distribution-aware loss to address biases caused by imbalanced data. The model was developed using data from the UK Biobank (UKB), with 98,672 participants in the development cohort and 113,559 participants (144,683 data pairs) for clinical evaluation. After adjusting for key confounders, individuals with a vascular age gap (AI-vascular age minus calendar age) exceeding 9 years had a significantly higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) (HR = 2.37, p < 0.005) and secondary outcomes, including diabetes (HR = 2.69, p < 0.005), hypertension (HR = 2.88, p < 0.005), coronary heart disease (HR = 2.20, p < 0.005), heart failure (HR = 2.15, p < 0.005), myocardial infarction (HR = 2.51, p < 0.005), stroke (HR = 2.55, p < 0.005), and all-cause mortality (HR = 2.51, p < 0.005). Conversely, participants with a vascular age gap below -9 years exhibited a significantly lower incidence of these outcomes. We further evaluated the longitudinal applicability of AI-vascular age using serial PPG data from the UKB, demonstrating its value in risk stratification by leveraging AI-vascular age at two distinct time points to predict future MACCE incidence. External validation was performed on a MIMIC-III-derived cohort (n = 2,343), where each one-year increase in vascular age gap was significantly associated with elevated in-hospital mortality risk (OR = 1.02, p < 0.005). In conclusion, our study establishes AI-vascular age as a novel, non-invasive digital biomarker for cardiovascular health assessment.

Title: FakET: Simulating Cryo-Electron Tomograms with Neural Style Transfer
Authors: Pavol Harar, Lukas Herrmann, Philipp Grohs, David Haselbach
Abstract: In cryo-electron microscopy, accurate particle localization and classification are imperative. Recent deep learning solutions, though successful, require extensive training data sets. The protracted generation time of physics-based models, often employed to produce these data sets, limits their broad applicability. We introduce FakET, a method based on Neural Style Transfer, capable of simulating the forward operator of any cryo transmission electron microscope. It can be used to adapt a synthetic training data set according to reference data producing high-quality simulated micrographs or tilt-series. To assess the quality of our generated data, we used it to train a state-of-the-art localization and classification architecture and compared its performance with a counterpart trained on benchmark data. Remarkably, our technique matches the performance, boosts data generation speed 750 times, uses 33 times less memory, and scales well to typical transmission electron microscope detector sizes. It leverages GPU acceleration and parallel processing. The source code is available at this https URL.

Title: Iterative Inversion of Ill-Conditioned MIMO Channels Using Symmetric Rank-$1$ Regularization
Authors: Jinfei Wang, Yi Ma, Rahim Tafazolli
Abstract: While iterative matrix inversion methods excel in computational efficiency, memory optimization, and support for parallel and distributed computing when managing large matrices, their limitations are also evident in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading channels. These methods encounter challenges related to slow convergence and diminished accuracy, especially in ill-conditioned scenarios, hindering their application in future MIMO networks such as extra-large aperture array. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel matrix regularization method termed symmetric rank-$1$ regularization (SR-$1$R). The proposed method functions by augmenting the channel matrix with a symmetric rank-$1$ matrix, with the primary goal of minimizing the condition number of the resultant regularized matrix. This significantly improves the matrix condition, enabling fast and accurate iterative inversion of the regularized matrix. Then, the inverse of the original channel matrix is obtained by applying the Sherman-Morrison transform on the outcome of iterative inversions. Our eigenvalue analysis unveils the best channel condition that can be achieved by an optimized SR-$1$R matrix. Moreover, a power iteration-assisted (PIA) approach is proposed to find the optimum SR-$1$R matrix without need of eigenvalue decomposition. The proposed approach exhibits logarithmic algorithm-depth in parallel computing for MIMO precoding. Finally, computer simulations demonstrate that SR-$1$R has the potential to reduce the required iteration by up to $35\%$ while achieving the performance of regularized zero-forcing.

Title: Regression coefficient estimation from remote sensing maps
Authors: Kerri Lu, Dan M. Kluger, Stephen Bates, Sherrie Wang
Abstract: Remote sensing map products are used to estimate regression coefficients relating environmental variables, such as the effect of conservation zones on deforestation. However, the quality of map products varies, and -- because maps are outputs of complex machine learning algorithms that take in a variety of remotely sensed variables as inputs -- errors are difficult to characterize. Thus, population-level estimates from such maps may be biased. In this paper, we apply prediction-powered inference (PPI) to regression coefficient estimation. PPI generates unbiased estimates by using a small amount of randomly sampled ground truth data to correct for bias in large-scale remote sensing map products. Applying PPI across multiple remote sensing use cases in regression coefficient estimation, we find that it results in estimates that are (1) more reliable than using the map product as if it were 100% accurate and (2) have lower uncertainty than using only the ground truth and ignoring the map product. Empirically, we observe effective sample size increases of up to 17-fold using PPI compared to only using ground truth data. This is the first work to estimate remote sensing regression coefficients without assumptions on the structure of map product errors. Data and code are available at this https URL.

Title: Multimodal Emotion Recognition using Audio-Video Transformer Fusion with Cross Attention
Authors: Joe Dhanith P R, Shravan Venkatraman, Vigya Sharma, Santhosh Malarvannan, Modigari Narendra
Abstract: Understanding emotions is a fundamental aspect of human communication. Integrating audio and video signals offers a more comprehensive understanding of emotional states compared to traditional methods that rely on a single data source, such as speech or facial expressions. Despite its potential, multimodal emotion recognition faces significant challenges, particularly in synchronization, feature extraction, and fusion of diverse data sources. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel transformer-based model named Audio-Video Transformer Fusion with Cross Attention (AVT-CA). The AVT-CA model employs a transformer fusion approach to effectively capture and synchronize interlinked features from both audio and video inputs, thereby resolving synchronization problems. Additionally, the Cross Attention mechanism within AVT-CA selectively extracts and emphasizes critical features while discarding irrelevant ones from both modalities, addressing feature extraction and fusion challenges. Extensive experimental analysis conducted on the CMU-MOSEI, RAVDESS and CREMA-D datasets demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed model. The results underscore the importance of AVT-CA in developing precise and reliable multimodal emotion recognition systems for practical applications.

Abstract: Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD) is crucial for estimating white matter fiber orientations using diffusion MRI data. A relevant parameter in CSD is the maximum order $l_{max}$ used in the spherical harmonics series, influencing the angular resolution of the Fiber Orientation Distributions (FODs). Lower $l_{max}$ values produce smoother and more stable estimates, but result in reduced angular resolution. Conversely, higher $l_{max}$ values, as employed in the Super-Resolved CSD variant, are essential for resolving narrow inter-fiber angles but lead to spurious lobes due to increased noise sensitivity. To address this issue, we propose a novel Spatially Regularized Super-Resolved CSD (SR$^2$-CSD) approach, incorporating spatial priors into the CSD framework. This method leverages spatial information among adjacent voxels, enhancing the stability and noise robustness of FOD estimations. SR$^2$-CSD facilitates the practical use of Super-Resolved CSD by including a J-invariant auto-calibrated total variation FOD denoiser. We evaluated the performance of SR$^2$-CSD against standard CSD and Super-Resolved CSD using phantom numerical data and various real brain datasets, including a test-retest sample of six subjects scanned twice. In phantom data, SR$^2$-CSD outperformed both CSD and Super-Resolved CSD, reducing the angular error (AE) by approximately half and the peak number error (PNE) by a factor of three across all noise levels considered. In real data, SR$^2$-CSD produced more continuous FOD estimates with higher spatial-angular coherency. In the test-retest sample, SR$^2$-CSD consistently yielded more reproducible estimates, with reduced AE, PNE, mean squared error, and increased angular correlation coefficient between the FODs estimated from the two scans for each subject.

Title: Geometry of the cumulant series in neuroimaging
Authors: Santiago Coelho, Filip Szczepankiewicz, Els Fieremans, Dmitry S. Novikov
Abstract: Water diffusion gives rise to micrometer-scale sensitivity of diffusion MRI (dMRI) to cellular-level tissue structure. The advent of precision medicine and quantitative imaging hinges on revealing the information content of dMRI, and providing its parsimonious basis- and hardware-independent "fingerprint". Here we reveal the geometry of a multi-dimensional dMRI signal, classify all 21 invariants of diffusion and covariance tensors in terms of irreducible representations of the group of rotations, and relate them to tissue properties. Previously studied dMRI contrasts are expressed via 7 invariants, while the remaining 14 provide novel complementary information. We design acquisitions based on icosahedral vertices guaranteeing minimal number of measurements to determine 3-4 most used invariants in only 1-2 minutes for the whole brain. Representing dMRI signals via scalar invariant maps with definite symmetries will underpin machine learning classifiers of brain pathology, development, and aging, while fast protocols will enable translation of advanced dMRI into clinical practice.

Title: Joint Fine-tuning and Conversion of Pretrained Speech and Language Models towards Linear Complexity
Authors: Mutian He, Philip N. Garner
Abstract: Architectures such as Linformer and Mamba have recently emerged as competitive linear time replacements for transformers. However, corresponding large pretrained models are often unavailable, especially in non-text domains. To remedy this, we present a Cross-Architecture Layerwise Distillation (CALD) approach that jointly converts a transformer model to a linear time substitute and fine-tunes it to a target task. We also compare several means to guide the fine-tuning to optimally retain the desired inference capability from the original model. The methods differ in their use of the target model and the trajectory of the parameters. In a series of empirical studies on language processing, language modeling, and speech processing, we show that CALD can effectively recover the result of the original model, and that the guiding strategy contributes to the result. Some reasons for the variation are suggested.

Title: RSNet: A Light Framework for The Detection of Multi-scale Remote Sensing Targets
Authors: Hongyu Chen, Chengcheng Chen, Fei Wang, Yuhu Shi, Weiming Zeng
Abstract: Recent advancements in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) ship detection using deep learning have significantly improved accuracy and speed, yet effectively detecting small objects in complex backgrounds with fewer parameters remains a challenge. This letter introduces RSNet, a lightweight framework constructed to enhance ship detection in SAR imagery. To ensure accuracy with fewer parameters, we proposed Waveletpool-ContextGuided (WCG) as its backbone, guiding global context understanding through multi-scale wavelet features for effective detection in complex scenes. Additionally, Waveletpool-StarFusion (WSF) is introduced as the neck, employing a residual wavelet element-wise multiplication structure to achieve higher dimensional nonlinear features without increasing network width. The Lightweight-Shared (LS) module is designed as detect components to achieve efficient detection through lightweight shared convolutional structure and multi-format compatibility. Experiments on the SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD) and High-Resolution SAR Image Dataset (HRSID) demonstrate that RSNet achieves a strong balance between lightweight design and detection performance, surpassing many state-of-the-art detectors, reaching 72.5\% and 67.6\% in \textbf{\(\mathbf{mAP_{.50:.95}}\) }respectively with 1.49M parameters. Our code will be released soon.

Authors: Max Bengtsson, Elif Keles, Gorkem Durak, Syed Anwar, Yuri S. Velichko, Marius G. Linguraru, Angela J. Waanders, Ulas Bagci
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach for segmenting pediatric brain tumors using a deep learning architecture, inspired by expert radiologists' segmentation strategies. Our model delineates four distinct tumor labels and is benchmarked on a held-out PED BraTS 2024 test set (i.e., pediatric brain tumor datasets introduced by BraTS). Furthermore, we evaluate our model's performance against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model using a new external dataset of 30 patients from CBTN (Children's Brain Tumor Network), labeled in accordance with the PED BraTS 2024 guidelines and 2023 BraTS Adult Glioma dataset. We compare segmentation outcomes with the winning algorithm from the PED BraTS 2023 challenge as the SOTA model. Our proposed algorithm achieved an average Dice score of 0.642 and an HD95 of 73.0 mm on the CBTN test data, outperforming the SOTA model, which achieved a Dice score of 0.626 and an HD95 of 84.0 mm. Moreover, our model exhibits strong generalizability, attaining a 0.877 Dice score in whole tumor segmentation on the BraTS 2023 Adult Glioma dataset, surpassing existing SOTA. Our results indicate that the proposed model is a step towards providing more accurate segmentation for pediatric brain tumors, which is essential for evaluating therapy response and monitoring patient progress.

Title: Improving Acoustic Side-Channel Attacks on Keyboards Using Transformers and Large Language Models
Authors: Jin Hyun Park, Seyyed Ali Ayati, Yichen Cai
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of microphones in everyday devices and the growing reliance on online services have amplified the risk of acoustic side-channel attacks (ASCAs) targeting keyboards. This study explores deep learning techniques, specifically vision transformers (VTs) and large language models (LLMs), to enhance the effectiveness and applicability of such attacks. We present substantial improvements over prior research, with the CoAtNet model achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our CoAtNet shows a 5.0% improvement for keystrokes recorded via smartphone (Phone) and 5.9% for those recorded via Zoom compared to previous benchmarks. We also evaluate transformer architectures and language models, with the best VT model matching CoAtNet's performance. A key advancement is the introduction of a noise mitigation method for real-world scenarios. By using LLMs for contextual understanding, we detect and correct erroneous keystrokes in noisy environments, enhancing ASCA performance. Additionally, fine-tuned lightweight language models with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) deliver comparable performance to heavyweight models with 67X more parameters. This integration of VTs and LLMs improves the practical applicability of ASCA mitigation, marking the first use of these technologies to address ASCAs and error correction in real-world scenarios.
