Title: WiRainbow: Single-Antenna Direction-Aware Wi-Fi Sensing via Dispersion Effect
Authors: Zhaoxin Chang, Shuguang Xiao, Fusang Zhang, Xujun Ma, Badii Jouaber, Qingfeng Zhang, Daqing Zhang
Abstract: Recently, Wi-Fi signals have emerged as a powerful tool for contactless sensing. During the sensing process, obtaining target direction information can provide valuable contextual insights for various applications. Existing direction estimation methods typically rely on antenna arrays, which are costly and complex to deploy in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present WiRainbow, a novel approach that enables single-antenna-based direction awareness for Wi-Fi sensing by leveraging the dispersion effect of frequency-scanning antennas (FSAs), which can naturally steer Wi-Fi subcarriers toward distinct angles during signal transmission. To address key challenges in antenna design and signal processing, we propose a coupled-resonator-based antenna architecture that significantly expands the narrow Field-of-View inherent in conventional FSAs, improving sensing coverage. Additionally, we develop a sensing signal-to-noise-ratio-based signal processing framework that reliably estimates target direction in multipath-rich environments. We prototype WiRainbow and evaluate its performance through benchmark experiments and real-world case studies, demonstrating its ability to achieve accurate, robust, and cost-effective direction awareness for diverse Wi-Fi sensing applications.

Title: A Fractional Variational Approach to Spectral Filtering Using the Fourier Transform
Authors: Nelson H. T. Lemes, José Claudinei Ferreira, Higor V. M. Ferreira
Abstract: The interference of fluorescence signals and noise remains a significant challenge in Raman spectrum analysis, often obscuring subtle spectral features that are critical for accurate analysis. Inspired by variational methods similar to those used in image denoising, our approach minimizes a functional involving fractional derivatives to balance noise suppression with the preservation of essential chemical features of the signal, such as peak position, intensity, and area. The original problem is reformulated in the frequency domain through the Fourier transform, making the implementation simple and fast. In this work, we discuss the theoretical framework, practical implementation, and the advantages and limitations of this method in the context of {simulated} Raman data, as well as in image processing. The main contribution of this article is the combination of a variational approach in the frequency domain, the use of fractional derivatives, and the optimization of the {regularization parameter and} derivative order through the concept of Shannon entropy. This work explores how the fractional order, combined with the regularization parameter, affects noise removal and preserves the essential features of the spectrum {and image}. Finally, the study shows that the combination of the proposed strategies produces an efficient, robust, and easily implementable filter.

Title: Adversarial Multi-Task Learning for Liver Tumor Segmentation, Dynamic Enhancement Regression, and Classification
Authors: Xiaojiao Xiao, Qinmin Vivian Hu, Tae Hyun Kim, Guanghui Wang
Abstract: Liver tumor segmentation, dynamic enhancement regression, and classification are critical for clinical assessment and diagnosis. However, no prior work has attempted to achieve these tasks simultaneously in an end-to-end framework, primarily due to the lack of an effective framework that captures inter-task relevance for mutual improvement and the absence of a mechanism to extract dynamic MRI information effectively. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-Task Interaction adversarial learning Network (MTI-Net), a novel integrated framework designed to tackle these tasks simultaneously. MTI-Net incorporates Multi-domain Information Entropy Fusion (MdIEF), which utilizes entropy-aware, high-frequency spectral information to effectively integrate features from both frequency and spectral domains, enhancing the extraction and utilization of dynamic MRI data. The network also introduces a task interaction module that establishes higher-order consistency between segmentation and regression, thus fostering inter-task synergy and improving overall performance. Additionally, we designed a novel task-driven discriminator (TDD) to capture internal high-order relationships between tasks. For dynamic MRI information extraction, we employ a shallow Transformer network to perform positional encoding, which captures the relationships within dynamic MRI sequences. In experiments on a dataset of 238 subjects, MTI-Net demonstrates high performance across multiple tasks, indicating its strong potential for assisting in the clinical assessment of liver tumors.

Title: A Fully Multivariate Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis Method for Fault Diagnosis
Authors: Khuram Naveed, Naveed ur Rehman
Abstract: We propose a fully multivariate generalization of multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) and leverage it to develop a fault diagnosis framework for multichannel machine vibration data. We introduce a novel covariance-weighted $L_{pq}$ matrix norm based on Mahalanobis distance to define a fully multivariate fluctuation function that uniquely captures cross-channel dependencies and variance biases in multichannel vibration data. This formulation, termed FM-MFDFA, allows for a more accurate characterization of the multiscale structure of multivariate signals. To enhance feature relevance, the proposed framework integrates multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) to isolate fault-relevant components before applying FM-MFDFA. Results on wind turbine gearbox data demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional MFDFA approaches by effectively distinguishing between healthy and faulty machine states, even under noisy conditions.

Title: Local Dissipativity Analysis of Nonlinear Systems
Authors: Amy K. Strong, Leila Bridgeman
Abstract: Dissipativity is an input-output (IO) characterization of nonlinear systems that enables compositional robust control through Vidyasagar's Network Dissipativity Theorem. However, determining the dissipativity of a system is an involved and, often, model-specific process. We present a general method to determine the local dissipativity properties of nonlinear, control affine systems. We simultaneously search for the optimal IO characterization of a system and synthesize a continuous piecewise affine (CPA) storage function via a convex optimization problem. To do so, we reformulate the relationship between the Hamilton-Jacobi inequality and the dissipation inequality as an linear matrix inequality (LMI) and develop novel LMI bounds for a triangulation. Further, we develop a method to synthesize a combined quadratic and CPA storage function to expand the systems the optimization problem is applicable to. Finally, we demonstrate that our method will always find a feasible IO characterization and a CPA or quadratic storage function given that the system is strictly locally dissipative.

Title: Dynamic Modeling of Load Demand in Electrified Highways Based on the EV Composition
Authors: Ashutossh Gupta, Vassilis Kekatos, Dionysios Aliprantis, Steve Pekarek
Abstract: Electrified roadways (ERs) equipped with the dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) technology can achieve longer driving range and reduce on-board battery requirements for electric vehicles (EVs). Due to the spatial arrangement of transmitter (Tx) coils embedded into the ER pavement, the power drawn by the EV's receiver (Rx) coil is oscillatory in nature. Therefore, understanding the dynamic behavior of the total DWPT load is important for power system dynamic studies. To this end, we model the load of individual EVs in the time and frequency domains for constant EV speed. We establish that a nonlinear control scheme implemented in existing DWPT-enabled EVs exhibits milder frequency harmonics compared to its linear alternative. According to this model, the harmonics of an EV load decrease in amplitude with the Rx coil length. We further propose and analyze stochastic models for the total DWPT load served by an ER segment. Our models explain how the EV composition on the ER affects its frequency spectrum. Interestingly, we show that serving more EVs with longer Rx coils (trucks) does not necessarily entail milder harmonics. Our analytical findings are corroborated using realistic flows from a traffic simulator and offer valuable insights to grid operators and ER designers.

Title: Adaptive Gradient Descent MPPT Algorithm With Complexity-Aware Benchmarking for Low-Power PV Systems
Authors: Kimia Ahmadi, Wouter A. Serdijn
Abstract: This paper proposes a computationally efficient, real-time maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm tailored for low-power photovoltaic (PV) systems operating under fast-changing irradiance and partial shading conditions (PSC). The proposed method augments the classical perturb and observe (P&O) algorithm with an adaptive gradient descent mechanism that dynamically scales the perturbation step size based on the instantaneous power-voltage slope, thereby minimizing tracking time and steady-state oscillations. An optional initialization routine enhances global MPP (GMPP) tracking under PSC. Extensive simulations, including irradiance recordings from freely moving rodent subjects relevant to the targeted application, and tests across varying converter topologies and temperatures, demonstrate its robust, topology-independent performance. The proposed algorithm achieves 99.94 percent MPPT efficiency under standard test conditions (STC), 99.21 percent when applied to experimental data, and more than 99.6 percent for the tested temperature profiles. Under PSC, the initialization routine improves tracking efficiency by up to 7.8 percent. A normalized gate-level complexity analysis and a unified figure-of-merit (FoM) incorporating efficiency, tracking time, and computational cost demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms 35 state-of-the-art P&O-based MPPT algorithms. These results underscore its suitability for integration in low-power power management integrated circuits (PMICs) operating under dynamic and resource-constrained conditions.

Title: Distributionally Robust Cascading Risk in Multi-Agent Rendezvous: Extended Analysis of Parameter-Induced Ambiguity
Authors: Vivek Pandey, Nader Motee
Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous multi-agent systems during time-critical tasks such as rendezvous is a fundamental challenge, particularly under communication delays and uncertainty in system parameters. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze the \emph{distributionally robust risk of cascading failures} in multi-agent rendezvous, where system parameters lie within bounded uncertainty sets around nominal values. Using a time-delayed dynamical network as a benchmark model, we quantify how small deviations in these parameters impact collective safety. We introduce a \emph{conditional distributionally robust functional}, grounded in a bivariate Gaussian model, to characterize risk propagation between agents. This yields a \emph{closed-form risk expression} that captures the complex interaction between time delays, network structure, noise statistics, and failure modes. These expressions expose key sensitivity patterns and provide actionable insight for the design of robust and resilient multi-agent networks. Extensive simulations validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

Title: Wavelet-Guided Water-Level Estimation for ISAC
Authors: Ayoob Salari, Kai Wu, Khawaja Fahad Masood, Y. Jay Guo, J. Andrew Zhang
Abstract: Real-time water-level monitoring across many locations is vital for flood response, infrastructure management, and environmental forecasting. Yet many sensing methods rely on fixed instruments - acoustic, radar, camera, or pressure probes - that are costly to install and maintain and are vulnerable during extreme events. We propose a passive, low-cost water-level tracking scheme that uses only LTE downlink power metrics reported by commodity receivers. The method extracts per-antenna RSRP, RSSI, and RSRQ, applies a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to the RSRP to isolate the semidiurnal tide component, and forms a summed-coefficient signature that simultaneously marks high/low tide (tide-turn times) and tracks the tide-rate (flow speed) over time. These wavelet features guide a lightweight neural network that learns water-level changes over time from a short training segment. Beyond a single serving base station, we also show a multi-base-station cooperative mode: independent CWTs are computed per carrier and fused by a robust median to produce one tide-band feature that improves stability and resilience to local disturbances. Experiments over a 420 m river path under line-of-sight conditions achieve root-mean-square and mean-absolute errors of 0.8 cm and 0.5 cm, respectively. Under a non-line-of-sight setting with vegetation and vessel traffic, the same model transfers successfully after brief fine-tuning, reaching 1.7 cm RMSE and 0.8 cm MAE. Unlike CSI-based methods, the approach needs no array calibration and runs on standard hardware, making wide deployment practical. When signals from multiple base stations are available, fusion further improves robustness.

Title: Data-Driven Post-Event Analysis with Real-World Oscillation Data from Denmark
Authors: Youhong Chen, Debraj Bhattacharjee, Balarko Chaudhuri, Mark O Malley, Nan Qin, Adrian Pilkaer Expethit
Abstract: This paper demonstrates how Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD), grounded in Koopman operator theory, can effectively identify the main contributor(s) to oscillations in power grids. We use PMU data recorded from a real 0.15 Hz oscillation event in Denmark for post-event analysis. To this end, the EDMD algorithm processed only voltage and current phasors from nineteen PMUs at different voltage levels across the Danish grid. In such a blind-test setting with no supplementary system information, EDMD accurately pinpointed the location of the main contributor to the 0.2 Hz oscillation, consistent with the location of the problematic IBR plant later confirmed by Energinet, where the underlying cause was a control system issue. Conventional approaches, such as the dissipating energy flow (DEF) method used in the ISO-NE OSL tool did not clearly identify this plant. This joint validation with Energinet, reinforcing earlier studies using simulated IBR-dominated systems and real PMU data from ISO-NE, highlights the potential of EDMD-based post-event analysis for identifying major oscillation contributors and enabling targeted SSO mitigation.

Title: Towards Audio Token Compression in Large Audio Language Models
Authors: Saurabhchand Bhati, Samuel Thomas, Hilde Kuehne, Rogerio Feris, James Glass
Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) demonstrate impressive performance across diverse tasks, ranging from speech recognition to general audio understanding. However, their scalability is limited by the quadratic complexity of attention and the high token rates of audio signals. These challenges make it difficult to extend LALMs to long-form audio and to deploy them on resource-constrained platforms such as edge devices. In this paper, we explore techniques such as unsupervised segmentation, uniform average pooling, etc., to reduce the number of audio tokens generated by the LALM's audio encoder but before they are consumed by the LLM decoder. To mitigate potential performance degradation introduced by the compressed representations, we employ low-rank adapters to finetune the model. We evaluate our proposed models on two tasks, automatic speech recognition and speech-to-speech translation tasks, that are dependent on effectively uncovering the underlying lexical content of the input signal and study the effect of downsampling on these tasks. Experimental results show that compressed LALMs can achieve performance closer to frame-level LALMs while reducing the input audio token count upto three times before the LLM backbone.

Title: RosettaSpeech: Zero-Shot Speech-to-Speech Translation from Monolingual Data
Authors: Zhisheng Zheng, Xiaohang Sun, Tuan Dinh, Abhishek Yanamandra, Abhinav Jain, Zhu Liu, Sunil Hadap, Vimal Bhat, Manoj Aggarwal, Gerard Medioni, David Harwath
Abstract: The scarcity of parallel speech corpora critically hampers speech-to-speech translation (S2ST), often forcing reliance on complex, multi-stage pipelines. This paper introduces RosettaSpeech, a novel and simplified framework for zero-shot S2ST that is trained on monolingual speech-text data augmented by machine translation supervision. While our method leverages the linguistic knowledge inherent in text-based NMT models, it strictly eliminates the need for parallel speech-to-speech pairs. Our model uniquely uses text as an intermediate bridge during training but functions as a direct, end-to-end speech-to-speech model at inference. This streamlined approach achieves state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. For instance, on the CVSS-C test set, RosettaSpeech outperforms leading systems, achieving an ASR-BLEU score of 25.17 for German-to-English and 29.86 for Spanish-to-English-relative gains of over 27% and 14%, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a single model can deliver strong many-to-one translation performance (FR/ES/DE -> EN). We also provide a foundational analysis of how training data scaling impacts model performance. By prioritizing reliance on abundant parallel text rather than difficult-to-acquire parallel speech, RosettaSpeech offers a scalable path to creating high-quality, speaker-preserving S2ST for a much broader array of languages.

Title: Independent policy gradient-based reinforcement learning for economic and reliable energy management of multi-microgrid systems
Authors: Junkai Hu, Li Xia
Abstract: Efficiency and reliability are both crucial for energy management, especially in multi-microgrid systems (MMSs) integrating intermittent and distributed renewable energy sources. This study investigates an economic and reliable energy management problem in MMSs under a distributed scheme, where each microgrid independently updates its energy management policy in a decentralized manner to optimize the long-term system performance collaboratively. We introduce the mean and variance of the exchange power between the MMS and the main grid as indicators for the economic performance and reliability of the system. Accordingly, we formulate the energy management problem as a mean-variance team stochastic game (MV-TSG), where conventional methods based on the maximization of expected cumulative rewards are unsuitable for variance metrics. To solve MV-TSGs, we propose a fully distributed independent policy gradient algorithm, with rigorous convergence analysis, for scenarios with known model parameters. For large-scale scenarios with unknown model parameters, we further develop a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on independent policy gradients, enabling data-driven policy optimization. Numerical experiments in two scenarios validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Our approaches fully leverage the distributed computational capabilities of MMSs and achieve a well-balanced trade-off between economic performance and operational reliability.

Title: An Exact, Finite Dimensional Representation for Full-Block, Circle Criterion Multipliers
Authors: Felix Biertümpfel, Bin Hu, Geir Dullerud, Peter Seiler
Abstract: This paper provides the first finite-dimensional characterization for the complete set of full-block, circle criterion multipliers. We consider the interconnection of a discrete-time, linear time-invariant system in feedback with a non-repeated, sector-bounded nonlinearity. Sufficient conditions for stability and performance can be derived using: (i) dissipation inequalities, and (ii) Quadratic Constraints (QCs) that bound the input/output pairs of the nonlinearity. Larger classes of QCs (or multipliers) reduce the conservatism of the conditions. Full-block, circle criterion multipliers define the complete set of all possible QCs for non-repeated, sector-bounded nonlinearities. These provide the least conservative conditions. However, full-block multipliers are defined by an uncountably infinite number of constraints and hence do not lead to computationally tractable solutions if left in this raw form. This paper provides a new finite-dimensional characterization for the set of full-block, circle criterion multipliers. The key theoretical insight is: the set of all input/output pairs of non-repeated sector-bounded nonlinearities is equal to the set of all incremental pairs for an appropriately constructed piecewise linear function. Our new description for the complete set of multipliers only requires a finite number of matrix copositivity constraints. These conditions have an exact, computationally tractable implementation for problems where the nonlinearity has small input/output dimensions $(\le 4)$. We illustrate the use of our new characterization via a simple example.

Title: Deep Parameter Interpolation for Scalar Conditioning
Authors: Chicago Y. Park, Michael T. McCann, Cristina Garcia-Cardona, Brendt Wohlberg, Ulugbek S. Kamilov
Abstract: We propose deep parameter interpolation (DPI), a general-purpose method for transforming an existing deep neural network architecture into one that accepts an additional scalar input. Recent deep generative models, including diffusion models and flow matching, employ a single neural network to learn a time- or noise level-dependent vector field. Designing a network architecture to accurately represent this vector field is challenging because the network must integrate information from two different sources: a high-dimensional vector (usually an image) and a scalar. Common approaches either encode the scalar as an additional image input or combine scalar and vector information in specific network components, which restricts architecture choices. Instead, we propose to maintain two learnable parameter sets within a single network and to introduce the scalar dependency by dynamically interpolating between the parameter sets based on the scalar value during training and sampling. DPI is a simple, architecture-agnostic method for adding scalar dependence to a neural network. We demonstrate that our method improves denoising performance and enhances sample quality for both diffusion and flow matching models, while achieving computational efficiency comparable to standard scalar conditioning techniques. Code is available at this https URL.

Title: Evaluating the Performance of a Modified Skin Temperature Sensor for Lower Limb Prostheses: An Experimental Comparison
Authors: Anirshu Devroy, Gregor Fritz, Mathias Brandstoetter
Abstract: Current rehabilitation of lower limb prostheses has significant challenges, especially with skin conditions, irritation and discomfort. Understanding the skin temperature and having comfortable wearable sensors that would monitor skin temperature in a real-time outdoor environment would be useful. The system would help the user and orthopedic technician to provide feedback and changes that might be required in the prosthesis. Hence in this paper, a series of experiments are conducted in order to understand and characterize the system behavior and compare a general thermistor and a modified thermistor as a potential method of temperature measurement for outdoor usage of prostheses. The paper goes on to compare the different modified thermistors behavior with their regular counterpart and highlights the challenges and improvement areas needed for such a modified thermistor for outdoor temperature monitoring in a prosthetic system. Initial results show that some of the modified thermistors showed better temperature recording compared to the rest. Finally, such modified thermistors can be a potential alternative for comfortable temperature measurement embedded in the prosthesis system. Such a system can provide valuable insights into temperature distribution and an early warning system for skin problems

Title: Data-Driven Assessment of Concrete Slab Integrity via Impact-Echo Signals and Neural Networks
Authors: Yeswanth Ravichandran, Duoduo Liao, Charan Teja Kurakula
Abstract: Subsurface defects such as delamination, voids, and honeycombing critically affect the durability of concrete bridge decks but are difficult to detect reliably using visual inspection or manual sounding. This paper presents a machine learning based Impact Echo (IE) framework that automates both defect localization and multi-class classification of common concrete defects. Raw IE signals from Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) laboratory slabs and in-service bridge decks are transformed via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into dominant peak-frequency features and interpolated into spatial maps for defect zone visualization. Unsupervised k-means clustering highlights low-frequency, defect-prone regions, while Ground Truth Masks (GTMs) derived from seeded lab defects are used to validate spatial accuracy and generate high-confidence training labels. From these validated regions, spatially ordered peak-frequency sequences are constructed and fed into a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network that classifies four defect types shallow delamination, deep delamination, voids, and honeycombing with 73% overall accuracy. Field validation on the bridge deck demonstrates that models trained on laboratory data generalize under realistic coupling, noise, and environmental variability. The proposed framework enhances the objectivity, scalability, and repeatability of Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE), supporting intelligent, data-driven bridge health monitoring at a network scale.

Title: 2D Sparse Array Design via Reweighted L1 Second Order Cone Programming for 3D Ultrasound Imaging
Authors: Xi Zhang, Miguel Bernal, Wei-Ning Lee
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) fully-addressed arrays can conveniently realize three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound imaging while fully controlled such arrays usually demands thousands of independent channels, which is costly. Sparse array technique using stochastic optimization methods is one of promising techniques to reduce channel counts while due to the stochastic nature of these methods, the optimized results are usually unstable. In this work, we introduce a sparse array design approach that formulates the synthesis problem of sparse arrays as second-order cone programming (SOCP) and a re-weighted L1 technique is implemented to sequentially optimize the SOCP. Based on this method, an on-grid quasi-flatten side-lobe (Q-Flats) 2D sparse array with side-lobe level (SLL) no more than -21.26 dB and 252 activated elements is designed, which aims to achieve as high contrast performance as possible under the limits of resolution and maximum number of independent channels (i.e., 256). The imaging performance of the Q-Flats array was compared with those of a corresponding dense array (Dense), a Fermat spiral array (Spiral) and a spatially 50%-Tukey tapered spiral array (Spiral-Taper) using Field II simulations in a multi-angle steered diverging wave transmission scheme. It was demonstrated that the Dense achieved the best resolution and contrast and the Spiral-Taper the worst. The Q-Flats showed better resolution (about 3%) but slightly worse contrast than the Spiral. All the results indicate the re-weighted L1 SOCP method is a promising and flexible method for seeking trade-offs among resolution, contrast, and number of activated elements.

Title: Evaluation of an ITD-to-ILD Transformation as a Method to Restore the Spatial Benefit in Speech Intelligibility in Hearing Impaired Listeners
Authors: Timm-Jonas Bäumer, Johannes W. de Vries, Stephan Töpken, Richard C. Hendriks, Peyman Goli, Steven van de Par
Abstract: To improve speech intelligibility in complex everyday situations, the human auditory system partially relies on Interaural Time Differences (ITDs) and Interaural Level Differences (ILDs). However, hearing impaired (HI) listeners often exhibit limited sensitivity to ITDs, resulting in decreased speech intelligibility performance. This study aimed to investigate whether transforming low-frequency ITDs into ILDs could reintroduce a binaural benefit for HI listeners. We conducted two experiments with HI listeners. The first experiment used binaurally phase-shifted sinusoids at different frequencies to evaluate the HI listeners ITD sensitivity threshold. All subjects had an increased ITD threshold at higher frequencies, with different ITD sensitivities between the subjects in the lower frequencies. In the second experiment, Speech Reception Thresholds (SRTs) were measured in different binaural configurations by manipulating Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs). The results showed that, despite the decreased ITD sensitivity, removing ITDs decreased SRTs by approximately 1 dB compared to the unprocessed baseline, where ITDs and ILDs are available. Furthermore, substituting low-frequency ITDs with ILDs yielded an improvement for a lateral target speaker. Adding the low-frequency ILDs while preserving the ITDs caused a significant improvement for speakers in all directions. These findings suggest that the proposed transformation method could be effective in restoring binaural benefits in HI listeners. The results of this study suggest the use of such transformation techniques to be implemented in hearing aids and cochlear implants, directly benefiting HI listeners.

Title: From Consensus to Robust Clustering: Multi-Agent Systems with Nonlinear Interactions
Authors: Anthony Couthures, Gustave Bainier, Vineeth Satheeskumar Varma, Samson Lasaulce, Irinel-Constantin Morarescu
Abstract: This paper establishes a theoretical framework to describe the transition from consensus to stable clustering in multi-agent systems with nonlinear, cooperative interactions. We first establish a sharp threshold for consensus. For a broad class of non-decreasing, Lipschitz-continuous interactions, an explicit inequality linking the interaction's Lipschitz constant to the second-largest eigenvalue of the normalized adjacency matrix of the interaction graph confines all system equilibria to the synchronization manifold. This condition is shown to be a sharp threshold, as its violation permits the emergence of non-synchronized equilibria. We also demonstrate that such clustered states can only arise if the interaction law itself possesses specific structural properties, such as unstable fixed points. For the clustered states that emerge, we introduce a formal framework using Input-to-State Stability (ISS) theory to quantify their robustness. This approach allows us to prove that the internal cohesion of a cluster is robust to perturbations from the rest of the network. The analysis reveals a fundamental principle: cluster coherence is limited not by the magnitude of external influence, but by its heterogeneity across internal nodes. This unified framework, explaining both the sharp breakdown of consensus and the quantifiable robustness of the resulting modular structures, is validated on Zachary's Karate Club network, used as a classic benchmark for community structure.

Title: The Spheres Dataset: Multitrack Orchestral Recordings for Music Source Separation and Information Retrieval
Authors: Jaime Garcia-Martinez, David Diaz-Guerra, John Anderson, Ricardo Falcon-Perez, Pablo Cabañas-Molero, Tuomas Virtanen, Julio J. Carabias-Orti, Pedro Vera-Candeas
Abstract: This paper introduces The Spheres dataset, multitrack orchestral recordings designed to advance machine learning research in music source separation and related MIR tasks within the classical music domain. The dataset is composed of over one hour recordings of musical pieces performed by the Colibrì Ensemble at The Spheres recording studio, capturing two canonical works - Tchaikovsky's Romeo and Juliet and Mozart's Symphony No. 40 - along with chromatic scales and solo excerpts for each instrument. The recording setup employed 23 microphones, including close spot, main, and ambient microphones, enabling the creation of realistic stereo mixes with controlled bleeding and providing isolated stems for supervised training of source separation models. In addition, room impulse responses were estimated for each instrument position, offering valuable acoustic characterization of the recording space. We present the dataset structure, acoustic analysis, and baseline evaluations using X-UMX based models for orchestral family separation and microphone debleeding. Results highlight both the potential and the challenges of source separation in complex orchestral scenarios, underscoring the dataset's value for benchmarking and for exploring new approaches to separation, localization, dereverberation, and immersive rendering of classical music.

Title: Stability of data-driven Koopman MPC with terminal conditions
Authors: Irene Schimperna, Lea Bold, Johannes Köhler, Karl Worthmann, Lalo Magni
Abstract: This paper derives conditions under which Model Predictive Control (MPC) with terminal conditions, using a data-driven surrogate model as a prediction model, asymptotically stabilizes the plant despite approximation errors. In particular, we prove recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability if a proportional error bound holds, where proportional means that the bound is linear in the norm of the state and the input. For a broad class of nonlinear systems, this condition can be satisfied using data-driven surrogate models generated by kernel Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (kEDMD) using the Koopman operator. Last, the applicability of the proposed framework is demonstrated in a numerical case study.

Title: Design and Measurements of mmWave FMCW Radar Based Non-Contact Multi-Patient Heart Rate and Breath Rate Monitoring System
Authors: Jewel Benny, Pranjal Mahajan, Srayan Sankar Chatterjee, Mohd Wajid, Abhishek Srivastava
Abstract: Recent developments in mmWave radar technologies have enabled the truly non-contact heart-rate (HR) and breath-rate (BR) measurement approaches, which provides a great ease in patient monitoring. Additionally, these technologies also provide opportunities to simultaneously detect HR and BR of multiple patients, which has become increasingly important for efficient mass monitoring scenarios. In this work, a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) mmWave radar based truly non-contact multiple patient HR and BR monitoring system has been presented. Furthermore, a novel approach is also proposed, which combines multiple processing methods using a least squares solution to improve measurement accuracy, generalization, and handle measurement error. The proposed system has been developed using Texas Instruments' FMCW radar and experimental results with multiple subjects are also presented, which show >97% and >93% accuracy in the measured BR and HR values, respectively.

Title: Response-Based Frequency Stability Assessment under Multi-Scale Disturbances in High-Renewable Power Systems
Authors: Jinhui Chen, Huadong Sun, Ping Wu, Baocai Wang, Bing Zhao
Abstract: In high-renewable power systems, active-power disturbances are becoming larger and exhibit increasingly diverse time scales, which complicates frequency stability assessment under unanticipated events. This paper presents a response-based frequency stability assessment method that uses disturbance power, inferred from generator electrical responses, to provide a unified treatment of multi-scale disturbances. Unanticipated disturbances are first classified into short-term and permanent events; permanent disturbances are further divided into step, second-level slope and minute-level slope disturbances. Based on the measured power responses of generator groups, a unified disturbance-power model is constructed to identify the disturbance type online and to quantify disturbance intensity through the disturbance power and its rate of change. Analytical frequency-response models are then derived for each disturbance class. For step disturbances, the maximum tolerable disturbance power is obtained under steady-state and transient frequency deviation constraints, and a safety-margin index is defined. For slope-type disturbances, an improved system frequency response (SFR) model and the rotor motion equation after exhaustion of primary frequency regulation are used to compute the over-limit time of frequency deviation. The proposed response-based assessment method is validated on the CSEE-FS frequency-stability benchmark system, demonstrating its effectiveness and accuracy for quantitative frequency stability assessment in high-renewable power systems.

Title: Adaptive Lighting Control in Visible Light Systems: An Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Illumination Framework
Authors: Xinyan Xie, Xuesong Wang, Xin Lai, Yongheng Wen, Fengrui Yang, Haoyang He, Lai Zhang, Dong Zhao
Abstract: Indoor visible light communication (VLC) is a promising sixth-generation (6G) technology, as its directional and sensitive optical signals are naturally suited for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). However, current research mainly focuses on maximizing data rates and sensing accuracy, creating a conflict between high performance, high energy consumption, and user visual comfort. This paper proposes an adaptive integrated sensing, communication, and illumination (ISCI) framework that resolves this conflict by treating energy savings as a primary objective. The framework's mechanism first partitions the receiving plane using a geometric methodology, defining an activity area and a surrounding non-activity area to match distinct user requirements. User location, determined using non-line-of-sight (NLOS) sensing, then acts as a dynamic switch for the system's optimization objective. The system adaptively shifts between minimizing total transmit power while guaranteeing communication and illumination performance in the activity area and maximizing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) uniformity in the non-activity area. Numerical results confirm that this adaptive ISCI approach achieves 53.59% energy savings over a non-adaptive system and improves SNR uniformity by 57.79%, while satisfying all illumination constraints and maintaining a mean localization error of 0.071 m.

Title: Respiratory Motion Compensation and Haptic Feedback for X-ray-Guided Teleoperated Robotic Needle Insertion
Authors: Ana Cordon-Avila, Mostafa Selim, Momen Abayazid
Abstract: Respiratory motion limits the accuracy and precision of abdominal percutaneous procedures. In this paper, respiratory motion is compensated robotically using motion estimation models. Additionally, a teleoperated insertion is performed using proximity-based haptic feedback to guide physicians during insertion, enabling a radiation-free remote insertion for the end-user. The study has been validated using a robotic liver phantom, and five insertions were performed. The resulting motion estimation errors were below 3 mm for all directions of motion, and the overall resulting 3D insertion errors were 2.60, 7.75, and 2.86 mm for the superior-inferior, lateral, and anterior-posterior directions of motion, respectively. The proposed approach is expected to minimize the chances of inaccurate treatment or diagnosis due to respiratory-induced motion and reduce radiation exposure.

Title: Multiport Analytical Pixel Electromagnetic Simulator (MAPES) for AI-assisted RFIC and Microwave Circuit Design
Authors: Junhui Rao, Yi Liu, Jichen Zhang, Zhaoyang Ming, Tianrui Qiao, Yujie Zhang, Chi Yuk Chiu, Hua Wang, Ross Murch
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel analytical framework, termed the Multiport Analytical Pixel Electromagnetic Simulator (MAPES). MAPES enables efficient and accurate prediction of the electromagnetic (EM) performance of arbitrary pixel-based microwave (MW) and RFIC structures. Inspired by the Integrated Internal Multiport Method (IMPM), MAPES extends the concept to the pixel presence/absence domain used in AI-assisted EM design. By introducing virtual pixels and diagonal virtual pixels and inserting virtual ports at critical positions, MAPES captures all horizontal, vertical, and diagonal electromagnetic couplings within a single multiport impedance matrix. Only a small set of full-wave simulations (typically about 1% of the datasets required by AI-assisted EM simulators) is needed to construct this matrix. Subsequently, any arbitrary pixel configuration can be evaluated analytically using a closed-form multiport relation without additional full-wave calculations. The proposed approach eliminates data-driven overfitting and ensures accurate results across all design variations. Comprehensive examples for single- and double-layer CMOS processes (180 nm and 65 nm) and PCBs confirm that MAPES achieves high prediction accuracy with 600- 2000x speed improvement compared to CST simulations. Owing to its efficiency, scalability and reliability, MAPES provides a practical and versatile tool for AI-assisted MW circuit and RFIC design across diverse fabrication technologies.

Title: Data-Driven Reduction of Fault Location Errors in Onshore Wind Farm Collectors
Authors: A. J. Alves Junior, M. J. B. B. Davi, R. A. S. Fernandes, M. Oleskovicz, D. V. Coury
Abstract: Accurate fault location is essential for operational reliability and fast restoration in wind farm collector networks. However, the growing integration of inverter-based resources changes the current and voltage behavior during faults, challenging the effectiveness of traditional phasor-based diagnostic methods. In this context, the present paper introduces an advanced machine-learning solution that enhances a deterministic fault distance estimator by incorporating a correction model driven by a Gated Residual Network, specifically designed to minimize residual fault location errors. Through comprehensive feature engineering and selection processes, an improved predictor was developed and trained on a diverse set of fault scenarios simulated in a PSCAD-based real-world wind farm model, including variations in fault type, resistance, location, inception angle, and generation penetration. Hyperparameter optimization was performed using the Optuna framework, and the robustness of the method was statistically validated. Results show a significant improvement in accuracy, with a 76% overall decrease in fault location error compared to state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed method demonstrates strong scalability and adaptability to topological and operational changes. This approach advances the deployment of data-driven fault location frameworks for modern power systems.

Title: Sparse shepherding control of large-scale multi-agent systems via Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Luigi Catello, Italo Napolitano, Davide Salzano, Mario di Bernardo
Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning framework for sparse indirect control of large-scale multi-agent systems, where few controlled agents shape the collective behavior of many uncontrolled agents. The approach addresses this multi-scale challenge by coupling ODEs (modeling controlled agents) with a PDE (describing the uncontrolled population density), capturing how microscopic control achieves macroscopic objectives. Our method combines model-free reinforcement learning with adaptive interaction strength compensation to overcome sparse actuation limitations. Numerical validation demonstrates effective density control, with the system achieving target distributions while maintaining robustness to disturbances and measurement noise, confirming that learning-based sparse control can replace computationally expensive online optimization.

Title: Design and Performance Assessment of a Virtualized IED for Digital Substations
Authors: Alailton J. Alves Junior, Denis V. Coury, Ricardo A. S. Fernandes
Abstract: Digital substations have significantly enhanced power grid protection by replacing traditional copper wiring with fiber-optic communication and integrating IEC 61850-compliant Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs), resulting in greater efficiency, reliability, and interoperability. While these advancements provide improved interoperability, challenges such as high costs, complex networks, and limited upgradeability persist. To mitigate these issues, the virtualization of IEDs has emerged as a cost-effective solution, offering scalability, simplified maintenance, and reduced hardware costs by replacing traditional hardware-based IEDs with software-based counterparts. However, the performance and reliability of virtual IEDs (vIED) must be rigorously evaluated to ensure their robustness in real-time applications. This paper develops, implements, and evaluates a vIED designed to match the performance of its hardware-based counterparts. The vIED was deployed on a server using virtual machines, with its core logic implemented in low-level programming languages to ensure high-speed, deterministic behavior. The performance was evaluated using real-time simulations, focusing on the response times of the protection functions. The results demonstrated that vIEDs achieved acceptable response times, validating their suitability for deployment in critical time-sensitive environments within digital substations.

Title: Scalable Multisubject Vital Sign Monitoring With mmWave FMCW Radar and FPGA Prototyping
Authors: Jewel Benny, Narahari N. Moudhgalya, Mujeev Khan, Hemant Kumar Meena, Mohd Wajid, Abhishek Srivastava
Abstract: In this work, we introduce an innovative approach to estimate the vital signs of multiple human subjects simultaneously in a non-contact way using a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar-based system. Traditional vital sign monitoring methods often face significant limitations, including subject discomfort with wearable devices, challenges in calibration, and the risk of infection transmission through contact measurement devices. To address these issues, this research is motivated by the need for versatile, non-contact vital monitoring solutions applicable in various critical scenarios. This work also explores the challenges of extending this capability to an arbitrary number of subjects, including hardware and theoretical limitations. Supported by rigorous experimental results and discussions, the paper illustrates the system's potential to redefine vital sign monitoring. An FPGA-based implementation is also presented as proof of concept for a hardware-based and portable solution, improving upon previous works by offering 2.7x faster execution and 18.4% less Look-Up Table (LUT) utilization, as well as providing over 7400x acceleration compared to its software counterpart.

Title: Analytical Phasor-Based Fault Location Enhancement for Wind Farm Collector Networks
Authors: Alailton J. Alves Junior, Daniel Barbosa, Ricardo A. S. Fernandes, Denis V. Coury
Abstract: The increasing integration of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) is reshaping fault current characteristics, presenting significant challenges to traditional protection and fault location methods. This paper addresses a key limitation in fault location within wind farm collector networks, i.e., one-terminal phasor-based methods become inaccurate when IBRs are electrically located downstream from the fault. In such cases, the voltage drop caused by IBR fault current injections is not captured by the Intelligent Electronic Device, resulting in a systematic overestimation of fault distance. To mitigate this issue, a general compensation framework was proposed by augmenting classical loop formulations with a distance-dependent voltage correction term. The methodology was derived analytically using a sequence-domain representation and generalized to multiple fault types through a unified notation. It maintains the simplicity and interpretability of conventional approaches and can be implemented using only local measurements. The method was evaluated through EMT simulations in PSCAD using a realistic wind farm model. Results show significant improvements in location accuracy, with average and maximum errors notably reduced, especially for ground-involved faults where reductions exceed 90\%. Furthermore, the compensation eliminates sensitivity to wind penetration levels and ensures uniform performance across feeders, positioning the method as a practical solution for modern renewable-dominated grids.

Title: Phase-Aware Code-Aided EM Algorithm for Blind Channel Estimation in PSK-Modulated OFDM
Authors: Chin-Hung Chen, Ivana Nikoloska, Wim van Houtum, Yan Wu, Alex Alvarado
Abstract: This paper presents a fully blind phase-aware expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for OFDM systems with the phase-shift keying (PSK) modulation. We address the well-known local maximum problem of the EM algorithm for blind channel estimation. This is primarily caused by the unknown phase ambiguity in the channel estimates, which conventional blind EM estimators cannot resolve. To overcome this limitation, we propose to exploit the extrinsic information from the decoder as model evidence metrics. A finite set of candidate models is generated based on the inherent symmetries of PSK modulation, and the decoder selects the most likely candidate model. Simulation results demonstrate that, when combined with a simple convolutional code, the phase-aware EM algorithm reliably resolves phase ambiguity during the initialization stage and reduces the local convergence rate from 80% to nearly 0% in frequency-selective channels with a constant phase ambiguity. The algorithm is invoked only once after the EM initialization stage, resulting in negligible additional complexity during subsequent turbo iterations.

Title: Model Predictive Control and Moving Horizon Estimation using Statistically Weighted Data-Based Ensemble Models
Authors: Laura Boca de Giuli, Samuel Mallick, Alessio La Bella, Azita Dabiri, Bart De Schutter, Riccardo Scattolini
Abstract: This paper presents a model predictive control (MPC) framework leveraging an ensemble of data-based models to optimally control complex systems under multiple operating conditions. A novel combination rule for ensemble models is proposed, based on the statistical Mahalanobis distance, enabling the ensemble weights to suitably vary across the prediction window based on the system input. In addition, a novel state observer for ensemble models is developed using moving horizon estimation (MHE). The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated on a benchmark energy system operating under multiple conditions.

Title: Blind Turbo Demodulation for Differentially Encoded OFDM with 2D Trellis Decomposition
Authors: Chin-Hung Chen, Yan Wu, Wim van Houtum, Alex Alvarado
Abstract: Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB)-like systems employ differentially encoded (DE) phase-shift keying (PSK) for transmission. While turbo-DE-PSK receivers offer substantial performance gains through iterative decoding by making the DE-PSK an inner code, they rely on accurate channel estimation without pilots, which is a key challenge in DAB-like scenarios. This paper develops a fully blind turbo-DE-PSK scheme that jointly estimates channel phase, channel gain, and noise variance directly from the received signal. The design leverages a two-dimensional (2D) trellis decomposition for blind phase estimation, complemented by power-based estimators for channel gain and noise variance. We provide a comprehensive system assessment across practical system parameters, including inner code length, phase quantization, and 2D block size. Simulation results show that the blind 2D turbo demodulator approaches the performance of receivers with perfect channel knowledge and remains robust under realistic transmission conditions.

Title: Evaluation of Large Language Models for Numeric Anomaly Detection in Power Systems
Authors: Yichen Liu, Hongyu Wu, Bo Liu
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained increasing attention in power grids for their general-purpose capabilities. Meanwhile, anomaly detection (AD) remains critical for grid resilience, requiring accurate and interpretable decisions based on multivariate telemetry. Yet the performance of LLMs on large-scale numeric data for AD remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs for numeric AD in power systems. We use GPT-OSS-20B as a representative model and evaluate it on the IEEE 14-bus system. A standardized prompt framework is applied across zero-shot, few-shot, in-context learning, low rank adaptation (LoRA), fine-tuning, and a hybrid LLM-traditional approach. We adopt a rule-aware design based on the three-sigma criterion, and report detection performance and rationale quality. This study lays the groundwork for further investigation into the limitations and capabilities of LLM-based AD and its integration with classical detectors in cyber-physical power grid applications.

Title: Influence of converter current limiting and prioritization on protection of highly IBR-penetrated networks
Authors: Andrés E. Quintero (1), Vinícius A. Lacerda (1), Oriol Gomis-Bellmunt (1), Moisés J. B. B. Davi (2), Mario Oleskovicz (2) ((1) CITCEA-UPC, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Spain, (2) University of São Paulo, Department of Electrical Engineering, São Carlos, Brazil)
Abstract: This paper investigates how grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) control strategies in inverter-based resources (IBRs) influence line distance and differential protection in converter-dominated transmission systems. A modified IEEE 39-bus system is evaluated with GFM and GFL units equipped with low-voltage ride-through logic, current limiting, and positive- or negative-sequence prioritization. Distance protection is implemented with a mho characteristic, while line differential protection uses an alpha-plane approach. Results show that phase-to-ground loops in distance protection can substantially overestimate the fault location near the Zone-1 reach. For line differential protection, external faults may cause the operating point to briefly enter the trip region of the alpha-plane, even for the healthy-phase in ABG faults under GFL control and during the initial moments of the fault, demanding strong external security measures. These findings highlight that modern converter controls, together with current limitation and sequence-current prioritization, can compromise the reliability and security of traditional protection schemes.

Title: Understanding Regional Inertia Dynamics in CAISO from Real Grid Disturbances
Authors: Saurav Dulal, Mohammed M. Olama, Ali R. Ekti, Nils M. Stenvig, Yilu Liu
Abstract: The shift from synchronous generators to inverter-based resources has caused power system inertia to be unevenly distributed across power grids. As a result, certain grid regions are more vulnerable to high rate-of-change of frequency (RoCoF) during disturbances. This paper presents a measurement-based framework for estimating grid inertia in CAISO (California Independent System Operator) region using real disturbance-driven frequency data from the Frequency Monitoring Network (FNET/GridEye). By analyzing confirmed disturbances from 2013 to 2024, we identify trends in regional inertia and frequency dynamics, highlighting their relationship with renewable generation and the evolving duck curve. Regional RoCoF values were up to six times higher than interconnection-wide values, coinciding with declining inertia. Recent recovery in inertia is attributed to the increased deployment of battery energy storage systems with synthetic inertia capabilities. These findings underscore the importance of regional inertia monitoring, strategic resource planning, and adaptive operational practices to ensure grid reliability amid growing renewable integration.

Title: Decentralized Shepherding of Non-Cohesive Swarms Through Cluttered Environments via Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Cristiana Punzo, Italo Napolitano, Cinzia Tomaselli, Mario di Bernardo
Abstract: This paper investigates decentralized shepherding in cluttered environments, where a limited number of herders must guide a larger group of non-cohesive, diffusive targets toward a goal region in the presence of static obstacles. A hierarchical control architecture is proposed, integrating a high-level target assignment rule, where each herder is paired with a selected target, with a learning-based low-level driving module that enables effective steering of the assigned target. The low-level policy is trained in a one-herder-one-target scenario with a rectangular obstacle using Proximal Policy Optimization and then directly extended to multi-agent settings with multiple obstacles without requiring retraining. Numerical simulations demonstrate smooth, collision-free trajectories and consistent convergence to the goal region, highlighting the potential of reinforcement learning for scalable, model-free shepherding in complex environments.

Title: Knowledge Distillation for Continual Learning of Biomedical Neural Fields
Authors: Wouter Visser, Jelmer M. Wolterink
Abstract: Neural fields are increasingly used as a light-weight, continuous, and differentiable signal representation in (bio)medical imaging. However, unlike discrete signal representations such as voxel grids, neural fields cannot be easily extended. As neural fields are, in essence, neural networks, prior signals represented in a neural field will degrade when the model is presented with new data due to catastrophic forgetting. This work examines the extent to which different neural field approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting and proposes a strategy to mitigate this issue. We consider the scenario in which data becomes available incrementally, with only the most recent data available for neural field fitting. In a series of experiments on cardiac cine MRI data, we demonstrate how knowledge distillation mitigates catastrophic forgetting when the spatiotemporal domain is enlarged or the dimensionality of the represented signal is increased. We find that the amount of catastrophic forgetting depends, to a large extent, on the neural fields model used, and that distillation could enable continual learning in neural fields.

Title: Group-wise Semantic Splitting Multiple Access for Multi-User Semantic Communication
Authors: Jungyeon Koh, Hyeonho Noh, Hyun Jong Yang
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a group-wise semantic splitting multiple access framework for multi-user semantic communication in downlink scenarios. The framework begins by applying a balanced clustering mechanism that groups users based on the similarity of their semantic characteristics, enabling the extraction of group-level common features and user-specific private features. The base station then transmits the common features via multicast and the private features via unicast, effectively leveraging both shared and user-dependent semantic information. To further enhance semantic separability and reconstruction fidelity, we design a composite loss function that integrates a reconstruction loss with a repulsion loss, improving both the accuracy of semantic recovery and the distinctiveness of common embeddings in the latent space. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 3.26% performance improvement over conventional schemes across various channel conditions, validating its robustness and semantic efficiency for next-generation wireless networks.

Title: Multi-Hypotheses Navigation in Collaborative Localization subject to Cyber Attacks
Authors: Peter Iwer Hoedt Karstensen, Roberto Galeazzi
Abstract: This paper addresses resilient collaborative localization in multi-agent systems exposed to spoofed radio frequency measurements. Each agent maintains multiple hypotheses of its own state and exchanges selected information with neighbors using covariance intersection. Geometric reductions based on distance tests and convex hull structure limit the number of hypotheses transmitted, controlling the spread of hypotheses through the network. The method enables agents to separate spoofed and truthful measurements and to recover consistent estimates once the correct hypothesis is identified. Numerical results demonstrate the ability of the approach to contain the effect of adversarial measurements, while also highlighting the impact of conservative fusion on detection speed. The framework provides a foundation for resilient multi-agent navigation and can be extended with coordinated hypothesis selection across the network.

Title: Design Of A Communication System To Send Text Using Lora At 400 MHz
Authors: Fabrizio André Farfán Prado, William César Pérez Campos, Steisy Anahi Carreño Tacuri, Favio David Cabrera Alva, Harold Jacobed Carhuas Lizarbe
Abstract: This work describes the design and implementation of a low-power wireless communication system for transmitting text using ESP32 modules and the LoRa DXLR01. The proposal arises as a solution to connectivity and energy-efficiency problems commonly found in rural areas and certain urban environments where Wi-Fi or mobile networks are unavailable or operate with limitations. To address this, LoRa technology known for its long-range capability and low power consumption is integrated with an ESP32 responsible for capturing, processing, and sending messages. The LoRa DXLR01 module, which operates in the 433 MHz band, is configured with parameters aimed at maximising both transmission range and efficient energy usage. Messages are sent using Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) modulation, improving signal penetration in obstructed areas and reducing the likelihood of errors. On the receiving end, the ESP32 interprets the data and displays it on an LCD screen. Additionally, the received information is sent to the ThingSpeak platform, allowing remote storage and visualisation without relying on conventional network infrastructure. Tests conducted in a controlled environment show an average latency of 3.2 seconds for text transmission. It was also verified that the system can be used in applications such as remote monitoring, infrastructure management, and access control.

Title: Semantic-Enhanced Feature Matching with Learnable Geometric Verification for Cross-Modal Neuron Registration
Authors: Wenwei Li, Lingyi Cai, Hui Gong, Qingming Luo, Anan Li
Abstract: Accurately registering in-vivo two-photon and ex-vivo fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography images of individual neurons is critical for structure-function analysis in neuroscience. This task is profoundly challenging due to a significant cross-modality appearance gap, the scarcity of annotated data and severe tissue deformations. We propose a novel deep learning framework to address these issues. Our method introduces a semantic-enhanced hybrid feature descriptor, which fuses the geometric precision of local features with the contextual robustness of a vision foundation model DINOV3 to bridge the modality gap. To handle complex deformations, we replace traditional RANSAC with a learnable Geometric Consistency Confidence Module, a novel classifier trained to identify and reject physically implausible correspondences. A data-efficient two-stage training strategy, involving pre-training on synthetically deformed data and fine-tuning on limited real data, overcomes the data scarcity problem. Our framework provides a robust and accurate solution for high-precision registration in challenging biomedical imaging scenarios, enabling large-scale correlative studies.

Title: VibraWave: Sensing the Pulse of Polluted Waters
Authors: Sagnik Ghosh, Sandip Chakraborty
Abstract: Conventional methods for water pollutant detection, such as chemical assays and optical spectroscopy, are often invasive, expensive, and unsuitable for real-time, portable monitoring. In this paper, we introduce VibraWave, a novel non-invasive sensing framework that combines mmWave radar with controlled acoustic excitation, tensor decomposition, and deep learning to detect and quantify a wide range of water pollutants. By capturing radar reflections as a three-dimensional tensor encoding phase dynamics, range bin power, and angle-of-arrival (AoA), we apply PARAFAC decomposition with non-negative constraints to extract compact, interpretable pollutant fingerprints. These are used to train a lightweight student neural network via knowledge distillation, enabling joint classification and quantification of heavy metals (Cu, Fe, Mg), oil emulsions, and sediments. Extensive experiments show that VibraWave achieves high accuracy and low RMSE across pure, binary, and tertiary mixtures, while remaining robust and computationally efficient, making it well-suited for scalable, real-time water quality monitoring.

Title: Entropy Coding for Non-Rectangular Transform Blocks using Partitioned DCT Dictionaries for AV1
Authors: Priyanka Das, Tim Classen, Mathias Wien
Abstract: Recent video codecs such as VVC and AV1 apply a Non-rectangular (NR) partitioning to combine prediction signals using a smooth blending around the boundary, followed by a rectangular transform on the whole block. The NR signal transformation is not yet supported. A transformation technique that applies the same partitioning to the 2D Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) bases and finds a sparse representation of the NR signal in such a dictionary showed promising gains in an experimental setup outside the reference software. This method uses the regular inverse transformation at the decoder to reconstruct a rectangular signal and discards the signal outside the region of interest. This design is appealing due to the minimal changes required at the decoder. However, current entropy coding schemes are not well-suited for optimally encoding these coefficients because they are primarily designed for DCT coefficients. This work introduces an entropy coding method that efficiently codes these transform coefficients by effectively modeling their properties. The design offers significant theoretical rate savings, estimated using conditional entropy, particularly for scenarios that are more dissimilar to DCT in an experimental setup.

Title: SIR Analysis for Affine Filter Bank Modulation
Authors: Henrique L. Senger, Gustavo P. Gonçalves, Bruno S. Chang, Hyeon Seok Rou, Kuranage Roche Rayan Ranasinghe, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, Didier Le Ruyet
Abstract: The signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of the Affine Filter Bank Modulation (AFBM) waveform is analyzed under minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalization in two domains; namely, the affine domain and the filtered time-domain (TD). Due to the incorporation of the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) and despreading/mapping, an interesting and counter-intuitive cancellation of the unwanted combination of the channel induced interference with the orthogonality approximation error is seen in the filtered TD, a process which does not occur in the affine domain. The direct impact on bit error rate (BER) provides a thorough validation of the proposed analysis and explains the substantial gains in performance of the filtered TD detection scheme as opposed to its affine domain equivalent

Title: Robust Rule-Based Sizing and Control of Batteries for Peak Shaving Applications
Authors: Lorenzo Nespoli, Vasco Medici
Abstract: As the cost of batteries lowers, sizing and control methods that are both fast and can achieve their promised performances when deployed are becoming more important. In this paper, we show how stochastically tuned rule based controllers (RBCs) can be effectively used to achieve both these goals, providing more realistic estimates in terms of achievable levelised cost of energy (LCOE), and better performances while in operation when compared to deterministic model predictive control (MPC). We test the proposed methodology on yearly profiles from real meters for peak shaving applications and provide strong evidence about these claims.

Title: Bang-Bang Evasion: Its Stochastic Optimality and a Terminal-Set-Based Implementation
Authors: Liraz Mudrik, Yaakov Oshman
Abstract: We address the problem of optimal evasion in a planar endgame engagement, where a target with bounded lateral acceleration seeks to avoid interception by a missile guided by a linear feedback law. Contrary to existing approaches, that assume perfect information or use heuristic maneuver models in stochastic settings, we formulate the problem in an inherently stochastic framework involving imperfect information and bounded controls. Complying with the generalized separation theorem, the control law factors in the posterior distribution of the state. Extending the well-known optimality of bang-bang evasion maneuvers in deterministic settings to the realm of realistic, stochastic evasion scenarios, we firstly prove that an optimal evasion strategy always exists, and that the set of optimal solutions includes at least one bang-bang policy, rendering the resulting optimal control problem finite-dimensional. Leveraging this structure, we secondly propose the closed-loop terminal-set-based evasion (TSE) strategy, and demonstrate its effectiveness in simulation against a proportional navigation pursuer. Monte Carlo simulations show that the TSE strategy outperforms traditional stochastic evasion strategies based on random telegraph, Singer, and weaving models.

Title: Model-free practical PI-Lead control design by ultimate sensitivity principle
Authors: Michael Ruderman
Abstract: Practical design and tuning of feedback controllers has to do often without any model of the given dynamic process. Only some general assumptions about the process, in this work type-one stable behavior, can be available for engineers, in particular in motion control systems. This paper proposes a practical and simple in realization procedure for designing a robust PI-Lead control without modeling. The developed method derives from the ultimate sensitivity principles, known in the empirical Ziegler-Nichols tuning of PID control, and makes use of some general characteristics of loop shaping. A three-steps procedure is proposed to determine the integration time constant, control gain, and Lead-element in a way to guarantee a sufficient phase margin, while all steps are served by only experimental observations of the output value. The proposed method is also evaluated with experiments on a noise-perturbed electro-mechanical actuator system with translational motion.

Title: Optimal Bit Detection in Thermal Noise Communication Systems Under Rician Fading
Authors: Mohamed El Jbari, Fernando D. A. García, Hugerles S. Silva, Felipe A. P. de Figueiredo, Rausley A. A. de Souza
Abstract: Thermal noise communication (TNC) enables ultra-low-power wireless links for Internet of Things (IoT) devices by modulating the variance of thermal noise, rather than using active carriers. Existing analyses often rely on Gaussian approximations and overlook fading effects, which limits their accuracy. This paper presents an accurate analytical framework for optimal bit detection in TNC systems under Rician fading. Using chi-squared statistics, we derive the optimal maximum-likelihood detection threshold and an expression for the bit error probability (BEP) via Gauss-Laguerre quadrature. The proposed model eliminates approximation errors and accurately characterizes performance for finite sample sizes. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the analytical results and demonstrate significant improvements in BEP compared with suboptimal Gaussian-based detection. Furthermore, the influence of key parameters, sample size, resistance ratio, and Rician K-factor, is quantified. The proposed framework provides a solid foundation for designing energy-efficient TNC receivers in future B5G/6G and large-scale IoT systems.

Title: Seeing Beyond Sound: Visualization and Abstraction in Audio Data Representation
Authors: Ashlae Blum'e
Abstract: In audio signal processing, the interpretation of complex information using visual representation enhances pattern recognition through its alignment with human perceptual systems. Software tools that carry hidden assumptions inherited from their historical contexts risk misalignment with modern workflows as design origins become obscured. We argue that creating tools that align with emergent needs improves analytical and creative outputs due to an increased affinity for using them. This paper explores the potentials associated with adding dimensionality and interactivity into visualization tools to facilitate complex workflows in audio information research using the Jellyfish Dynamite software.

Title: MTTR-A: Measuring Cognitive Recovery Latency in Multi-Agent Systems
Authors: Barak Or
Abstract: Ensuring cognitive stability in autonomous multi-agent systems (MAS) is a central challenge for large-scale, distributed AI. While existing observability tools monitor system outputs, they cannot quantify how rapidly agentic workflows recover once reasoning coherence has been lost. We adapt classical reliability metrics-Mean Time-to-Recovery (MTTR), Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), and related ratios-into the cognitive domain, defining MTTR-A (Mean Time-to-Recovery for Agentic Systems) as a runtime measure of cognitive recovery latency. MTTR-A quantifies the time required for a MAS to detect reasoning drift and restore consistent operation, capturing the recovery of reasoning coherence rather than infrastructural repair. A benchmark simulation using the AG~News corpus and the LangGraph orchestration framework was conducted, modeling recovery latencies across multiple reflex modes. Automated reflexes restored stability within approximately 6s on average, while human-approval interventions required about 12s. Across 200 runs, the median simulated MTTR-A was 6.21+-2.14s, MTBF=6.7+-2.14s, and NRR=0.08, demonstrating measurable runtime resilience across reflex strategies. By formalizing recovery latency as a quantifiable property of distributed reasoning-and deriving reliability bounds linking recovery time and cognitive uptime-this work establishes a foundation for runtime dependability in agentic cognition, transforming cognitive recovery from an ad-hoc process into a standardized, interpretable performance

Title: Video Object Recognition in Mobile Edge Networks: Local Tracking or Edge Detection?
Authors: Kun Guo, Yun Shen, Xijun Wang, Chaoqun You, Yun Rui, Tony Q. S. Quek
Abstract: Fast and accurate video object recognition, which relies on frame-by-frame video analytics, remains a challenge for resource-constrained devices such as traffic cameras. Recent advances in mobile edge computing have made it possible to offload computation-intensive object detection to edge servers equipped with high-accuracy neural networks, while lightweight and fast object tracking algorithms run locally on devices. This hybrid approach offers a promising solution but introduces a new challenge: deciding when to perform edge detection versus local tracking. To address this, we formulate two long-term optimization problems for both single-device and multi-device scenarios, taking into account the temporal correlation of consecutive frames and the dynamic conditions of mobile edge networks. Based on the formulation, we propose the LTED-Ada in single-device setting, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that adaptively selects between local tracking and edge detection, according to the frame rate as well as recognition accuracy and delay requirement. In multi-device setting, we further enhance LTED-Ada using federated learning to enable collaborative policy training across devices, thereby improving its generalization to unseen frame rates and performance requirements. Finally, we conduct extensive hardware-in-the-loop experiments using multiple Raspberry Pi 4B devices and a personal computer as the edge server, demonstrating the superiority of LTED-Ada.

Title: Learning Multi-Access Point Coordination in Agentic AI Wi-Fi with Large Language Models
Authors: Yifan Fan, Le Liang, Peng Liu, Xiao Li, Ziyang Guo, Qiao Lan, Shi Jin, Wen Tong
Abstract: Multi-access point coordination (MAPC) is a key technology for enhancing throughput in next-generation Wi-Fi within dense overlapping basic service sets. However, existing MAPC protocols rely on static, protocol-defined rules, which limits their ability to adapt to dynamic network conditions such as varying interference levels and topologies. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Agentic AI Wi-Fi framework where each access point, modeled as an autonomous large language model agent, collaboratively reasons about the network state and negotiates adaptive coordination strategies in real time. This dynamic collaboration is achieved through a cognitive workflow that enables the agents to engage in natural language dialogue, leveraging integrated memory, reflection, and tool use to ground their decisions in past experience and environmental feedback. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that our agentic framework successfully learns to adapt to diverse and dynamic network environments, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art spatial reuse baseline and validating its potential as a robust and intelligent solution for future wireless networks.

Title: Automated Histopathologic Assessment of Hirschsprung Disease Using a Multi-Stage Vision Transformer Framework
Authors: Youssef Megahed, Saleh Abou-Alwan, Anthony Fuller, Dina El Demellawy, Steven Hawken, Adrian D. C. Chan
Abstract: Hirschsprung Disease is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus. Therefore, their correct identification is crucial for diagnosing Hirschsprung disease. We introduce a three-stage segmentation framework based on a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) that mimics the pathologist's diagnostic approach. The framework sequentially segments the muscularis propria, delineates the myenteric plexus, and identifies ganglion cells within anatomically valid regions. 30 whole-slide images of colon tissue were used, each containing expert manual annotations of muscularis, plexus, and ganglion cells at varying levels of certainty. A 5-fold cross-validation scheme was applied to each stage, along with resolution-specific tiling strategies and tailored postprocessing to ensure anatomical consistency. The proposed method achieved a Dice coefficient of 89.9% and a Plexus Inclusion Rate of 100% for muscularis segmentation. Plexus segmentation reached a recall of 94.8%, a precision of 84.2% and a Ganglia Inclusion Rate of 99.7%. For high-certainty ganglion cells, the model achieved 62.1% precision and 89.1% recall, while joint certainty scores yielded 67.0% precision. These results indicate that ViT-based models are effective at leveraging global tissue context and capturing cellular morphology at small scales, even within complex histological tissue structures. This multi-stage methodology has great potential to support digital pathology workflows by reducing inter-observer variability and assisting in the evaluation of Hirschsprung disease. The clinical impact will be evaluated in future work with larger multi-center datasets and additional expert annotations.

Title: A Direct Calibration Algorithm for ADC Interleaving
Authors: Chi-kwan Chan, Hina Suzuki, David Forbes, Andrew Thomas West, Arash Roshanineshat, Daniel P. Marrone, Amy Lowitz
Abstract: We introduce a novel direct calibration algorithm to address phase delay, gain, and offset mismatches in Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) time interleaving systems. These mismatches, common in high-speed data acquisition, degrade system performance and signal integrity, particularly in applications such as radio astronomy and very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). Our proposed algorithm uses a sinusoidal reference signal and Fourier analysis to isolate and correct each type of mismatch, providing a computationally efficient solution. Extensive numerical simulations validate the algorithm's effectiveness and demonstrate its ability to significantly enhance signal reconstruction accuracy compared to existing methods. This work provides a robust and scalable solution for maintaining signal fidelity in interleaved ADC systems and has broad applications in fields that require high-speed data acquisition.

Title: A Review of Pseudospectral Optimal Control: From Theory to Flight
Authors: I. M. Ross, M. Karpenko
Abstract: The home space for optimal control is a Sobolev space. The home space for pseudospectral theory is also a Sobolev space. It thus seems natural to combine pseudospectral theory with optimal control theory and construct ``pseudospectral optimal control theory,'' a term coined by Ross. In this paper, we review key theoretical results in pseudospectral optimal control that have proven to be critical for a successful flight. Implementation details of flight demonstrations onboard NASA spacecraft are discussed along with emerging trends and techniques in both theory and practice. The 2011 launch of pseudospectral optimal control in embedded platforms is changing the way in which we see solutions to challenging control problems in aerospace and autonomous systems.

Title: NOIR 2.0: Neural Signal Operated Intelligent Robots for Everyday Activities
Authors: Tasha Kim, Yingke Wang, Hanvit Cho, Alex Hodges
Abstract: Neural Signal Operated Intelligent Robots (NOIR) system is a versatile brain-robot interface that allows humans to control robots for daily tasks using their brain signals. This interface utilizes electroencephalography (EEG) to translate human intentions regarding specific objects and desired actions directly into commands that robots can execute. We present NOIR 2.0, an enhanced version of NOIR. NOIR 2.0 includes faster and more accurate brain decoding algorithms, which reduce task completion time by 46%. NOIR 2.0 uses few-shot robot learning algorithms to adapt to individual users and predict their intentions. The new learning algorithms leverage foundation models for more sample-efficient learning and adaptation (15 demos vs. a single demo), significantly reducing overall human time by 65%.

Title: MODEST: Multi-Optics Depth-of-Field Stereo Dataset
Authors: Nisarg K. Trivedi, Vinayak A. Belludi, Li-Yun Wang, Pardis Taghavi, Dante Lok
Abstract: Reliable depth estimation under real optical conditions remains a core challenge for camera vision in systems such as autonomous robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent progress in depth estimation and depth-of-field rendering, research remains constrained by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity, real stereo DSLR datasets, limiting real-world generalization and evaluation of models trained on synthetic data as shown extensively in literature. We present the first high-resolution (5472$\times$3648px) stereo DSLR dataset with 18000 images, systematically varying focal length and aperture across complex real scenes and capturing the optical realism and complexity of professional camera systems. For 9 scenes with varying scene complexity, lighting and background, images are captured with two identical camera assemblies at 10 focal lengths (28-70mm) and 5 apertures (f/2.8-f/22), spanning 50 optical configurations in 2000 images per scene. This full-range optics coverage enables controlled analysis of geometric and optical effects for monocular and stereo depth estimation, shallow depth-of-field rendering, deblurring, 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Each focal configuration has a dedicated calibration image set, supporting evaluation of classical and learning based methods for intrinsic and extrinsic calibration. The dataset features challenging visual elements such as multi-scale optical illusions, reflective surfaces, mirrors, transparent glass walls, fine-grained details, and natural / artificial ambient light variations. This work attempts to bridge the realism gap between synthetic training data and real camera optics, and demonstrates challenges with the current state-of-the-art monocular, stereo depth and depth-of-field methods. We release the dataset, calibration files, and evaluation code to support reproducible research on real-world optical generalization.

Title: Performance Evaluation of Low-Latency Live Streaming of MPEG-DASH UHD video over Commercial 5G NSA/SA Network
Authors: Kasidis Arunruangsirilert, Bo Wei, Hang Song, Jiro Katto
Abstract: 5G Standalone (SA) is the goal of the 5G evolution, which aims to provide higher throughput and lower latency than the existing LTE network. One of the main applications of 5G is the real-time distribution of Ultra High-Definition (UHD) content with a resolution of 4K or 8K. In Q2/2021, Advanced Info Service (AIS), the biggest operator in Thailand, launched 5G SA, providing both 5G SA/NSA service nationwide in addition to the existing LTE network. While many parts of the world are still in process of rolling out the first phase of 5G in Non-Standalone (NSA) mode, 5G SA in Thailand already covers more than 76% of the population. In this paper, UHD video will be a real-time live streaming via MPEG-DASH over different mobile network technologies with minimal buffer size to provide the lowest latency. Then, performance such as the number of dropped segments, MAC throughput, and latency are evaluated in various situations such as stationary, moving in the urban area, moving at high speed, and also an ideal condition with maximum SINR. It has been found that 5G SA can deliver more than 95% of the UHD video segment successfully within the required time window in all situations, while 5G NSA produced mixed results depending on the condition of the LTE network. The result also reveals that the LTE network failed to deliver more than 20% of the video segment within the deadline, which shows that 5G SA is absolutely necessary for low-latency UHD video streaming and 5G NSA may not be good enough for such task as it relies on the legacy control signal.

Title: Data-driven control of continuous-time systems: A synthesis-operator approach
Authors: Masashi Wakaiki
Abstract: This paper addresses data-driven control of continuous-time systems. We develop a framework based on synthesis operators associated with input and state trajectories. A key advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require the state derivative and uses continuous-time data directly without sampling or filtering. First, systems compatible with given data are described by the synthesis operators into which data trajectories are embedded. Next, we characterize data informativity properties for system identification and for stabilization. Finally, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for informativity for quadratic stabilization in the presence of process noise. This condition is formulated as linear matrix inequalities by exploiting the finite-rank structure of the synthesis operators.

Title: Accelerated ADMM: Automated Parameter Tuning and Improved Linear Convergence
Authors: Meisam Tavakoli, Fabian Jakob, Guido Carnevale, Giuseppe Notarstefano, Andrea Iannelli
Abstract: This work studies the linear convergence of an accelerated scheme of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for strongly convex and Lipschitz-smooth problems. We use the methodology of expressing the accelerated ADMM as a Lur'e system, i.e., an interconnection of a linear dynamical system in feedback with a slope-restricted operator, and we use Integral Quadratic Constraints to establish linear convergence. In addition, we propose several parameter tuning heuristics and their impact on the convergence rate through numerical analyses. Our new bounds show significantly improved linear convergence rates compared to the vanilla algorithm and previous proposed accelerated variants, which is also empirically validated on a LASSO regression benchmark.

Title: DynamicAdaptiveClimb: Adaptive Cache Replacement with Dynamic Resizing
Authors: Daniel Berend, Shlomi Dolev, Sweta Kumari, Dhruv Mishra, Marina Kogan-Sadetsky, Archit Somani
Abstract: Efficient cache management is critical for optimizing the system performance, and numerous caching mechanisms have been proposed, each exploring various insertion and eviction strategies. In this paper, we present AdaptiveClimb and its extension, DynamicAdaptiveClimb, two novel cache replacement policies that leverage lightweight, cache adaptation to outperform traditional approaches. Unlike classic Least Recently Used (LRU) and Incremental Rank Progress (CLIMB) policies, AdaptiveClimb dynamically adjusts the promotion distance (jump) of the cached objects based on recent hit and miss patterns, requiring only a single tunable parameter and no per-item statistics. This enables rapid adaptation to changing access distributions while maintaining low overhead. Building on this foundation, DynamicAdaptiveClimb further enhances adaptability by automatically tuning the cache size in response to workload demands. Our comprehensive evaluation across a diverse set of real-world traces, including 1067 traces from 6 different datasets, demonstrates that DynamicAdaptiveClimb consistently achieves substantial speedups and higher hit ratios compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, our approach achieves up to a 29% improvement in hit ratio and a substantial reduction in miss penalties compared to the FIFO baseline. Furthermore, it outperforms the next-best contenders, AdaptiveClimb and SIEVE [43], by approximately 10% to 15%, especially in environments characterized by fluctuating working set sizes. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in delivering efficient performance, making it well-suited for modern, dynamic caching environments.

Title: Acoustic neural networks: Identifying design principles and exploring physical feasibility
Authors: Ivan Kalthoff, Marcel Rey, Raphael Wittkowski
Abstract: Wave-guide-based physical systems provide a promising route toward energy-efficient analog computing beyond traditional electronics. Within this landscape, acoustic neural networks represent a promising approach for achieving low-power computation in environments where electronics are inefficient or limited, yet their systematic design has remained largely unexplored. Here we introduce a framework for designing and simulating acoustic neural networks, which perform computation through the propagation of sound waves. Using a digital-twin approach, we train conventional neural network architectures under physically motivated constraints including non-negative signals and weights, the absence of bias terms, and nonlinearities compatible with intensity-based, non-negative acoustic signals. Our work provides a general framework for acoustic neural networks that connects learnable network components directly to physically measurable acoustic properties, enabling the systematic design of realizable acoustic computing systems. We demonstrate that constrained recurrent and hierarchical architectures can perform accurate speech classification, and we propose the SincHSRNN, a hybrid model that combines learnable acoustic bandpass filters with hierarchical temporal processing. The SincHSRNN achieves up to 95% accuracy on the AudioMNIST dataset while remaining compatible with passive acoustic components. Beyond computational performance, the learned parameters correspond to measurable material and geometric properties such as attenuation and transmission. Our results establish general design principles for physically realizable acoustic neural networks and outline a pathway toward low-power, wave-based neural computing.

Title: The Theory of Storage in a Power System with Stochastic Demand
Authors: Darryl Biggar, Mohammad Reza Hesamzadeh
Abstract: Electric power systems are increasingly turning to energy storage systems to balance supply and demand. But how much storage is required? What is the optimal volume of storage in a power system and on what does it depend? In addition, what form of hedge contracts do storage facilities require? We answer these questions in the special case in which the uncertainty in the power system involves successive draws of an independent, identically-distributed random variable. We characterize the conditions for the optimal operation of, and investment in, storage and show how these conditions can be understood graphically using price-duration curves. We also characterize the optimal hedge contracts for storage units.

Title: A 0.32 mm$^2$ 100 Mb/s 223 mW ASIC in 22FDX for Joint Jammer Mitigation, Channel Estimation, and SIMO Data Detection
Authors: Jonas Elmiger, Fabian Stuber, Oscar Castañeda, Gian Marti, Christoph Studer
Abstract: We present the first single-input multiple-output (SIMO) receiver ASIC that jointly performs jammer mitigation, channel estimation, and data detection. The ASIC implements a recent algorithm called siMultaneous mitigAtion, Estimation, and Detection (MAED). MAED mitigates smart jammers via spatial filtering using a nonlinear optimization problem that unifies jammer estimation and nulling, channel estimation, and data detection to achieve state-of-the-art error-rate performance under jamming. The design supports eight receive antennas and enables mitigation of smart jammers as well as of barrage jammers. The ASIC is fabricated in 22 nm FD-SOI, has a core area of 0.32 mm$^2$, and achieves a throughput of 100 Mb/s at 223 mW, thus delivering 3$\times$ higher per-user throughput and 4.5$\times$ higher area efficiency than the state-of-the-art jammer-resilient detector.

Title: Predictive Safety Shield for Dyna-Q Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Jin Pin, Krasowski Hanna, Vanneaux Elena
Abstract: Obtaining safety guarantees for reinforcement learning is a major challenge to achieve applicability for real-world tasks. Safety shields extend standard reinforcement learning and achieve hard safety guarantees. However, existing safety shields commonly use random sampling of safe actions or a fixed fallback controller, therefore disregarding future performance implications of different safe actions. In this work, we propose a predictive safety shield for model-based reinforcement learning agents in discrete space. Our safety shield updates the Q-function locally based on safe predictions, which originate from a safe simulation of the environment model. This shielding approach improves performance while maintaining hard safety guarantees. Our experiments on gridworld environments demonstrate that even short prediction horizons can be sufficient to identify the optimal path. We observe that our approach is robust to distribution shifts, e.g., between simulation and reality, without requiring additional training.

Title: Closed Form HJB Solution for Continuous-Time Optimal Control of a Non-Linear Input-Affine System
Authors: Akash Vyas, Shreyas Kumar, Jayant Kumar Mohanta, Ravi Prakash
Abstract: Designing optimal controllers for nonlinear dynamical systems often relies on reinforcement learning and adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) to approximate solutions of the Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) equation. However, these methods require iterative training and depend on an initially admissible policy. This work introduces a new analytical framework that yields closed-form solutions to the HJB equation for a class of continuous-time nonlinear input-affine systems with known dynamics. Unlike ADP-based approaches, it avoids iterative learning and numerical approximation. Lyapunov theory is used to prove the asymptotic stability of the resulting closed-loop system, and theoretical guarantees are provided. The method offers a closed-form control policy derived from the HJB framework, demonstrating improved computational efficiency and optimal performance on state-of-the-art optimal control problems in the literature.

Title: Modeling, Analysis, and Control of Continuous-Time Weighted-Median Opinion Dynamics
Authors: Yi Han, Julien M. Hendrickx, Ge Chen, Wenjun Mei
Abstract: Simple yet predictive mathematical models are essential for mechanistic understanding of opinion evolution in social groups. The weighted-median mechanism has recently been proposed as a well-founded alternative to conventional DeGroot-type opinion dynamics. However, the original weighted-median model excludes compromise behavior, as individuals directly adopt their neighbors' opinions without forming intermediate values. In this paper, we introduce a parsimonious continuous-time extension of the weighted-median model by incorporating individual inertia, allowing opinions to move gradually toward the neighbors' weighted median. Empirical evidence shows that this model outperforms both the original weighted-median and DeGroot models with inertia in predicting opinion shifts. We provide a complete theoretical analysis of the proposed dynamics: the equilibria are characterized and shown to be Lyapunov stable; global convergence is established via the Bony-Brezis method, yielding necessary and sufficient conditions for consensus from arbitrary initial states. In addition, we derive a graph-theoretic condition for persistent disagreement and a necessary and sufficient condition for steering the system to any prescribed consensus value through constant external inputs to a subset of individuals. These results reveal how a social group's resilience to external manipulation fundamentally depends on its internal network structure.

Title: L4acados: Learning-based models for acados, applied to Gaussian process-based predictive control
Authors: Amon Lahr, Joshua Näf, Kim P. Wabersich, Jonathan Frey, Pascal Siehl, Andrea Carron, Moritz Diehl, Melanie N. Zeilinger
Abstract: Incorporating learning-based models, such as artificial neural networks or Gaussian processes, into model predictive control (MPC) strategies can significantly improve control performance and online adaptation capabilities for real-world applications. Still, enabling state-of-the-art implementations of learning-based models for MPC is complicated by the challenge of interfacing machine learning frameworks with real-time optimal control software. This work aims at filling this gap by incorporating external sensitivities in sequential quadratic programming solvers for nonlinear optimal control. To this end, we provide L4acados, a general framework for incorporating Python-based dynamics models in the real-time optimal control software acados. By computing external sensitivities via a user-defined Python module, L4acados enables the implementation of MPC controllers with learning-based residual models in acados, while supporting parallelization of sensitivity computations when preparing the quadratic subproblems. We demonstrate significant speed-ups and superior scaling properties of L4acados compared to available software using a neural-network-based control example. Last, we provide an efficient and modular real-time implementation of Gaussian process-based MPC using L4acados, which is applied to two hardware examples: autonomous miniature racing, as well as motion control of a full-scale autonomous vehicle for an ISO lane change maneuver.

Title: Boosting the transient performance of reference tracking controllers with neural networks
Authors: Nicolas Kirsch, Leonardo Massai, Giancarlo Ferrari-Trecate
Abstract: Reference tracking is a key objective in many control systems, including those characterized by complex nonlinear dynamics. In these settings, traditional control approaches can effectively ensure steady-state accuracy but often struggle to explicitly optimize transient performance. Neural network controllers have gained popularity due to their adaptability to nonlinearities and disturbances; however, they often lack formal closed-loop stability and performance guarantees. To address these challenges, a recently proposed neural-network control framework known as Performance Boosting (PB) has demonstrated the ability to maintain $\mathcal{L}_p$ stability properties of nonlinear systems while optimizing generic transient costs. This paper extends the PB approach to reference tracking problems. First, we characterize the complete set of nonlinear controllers that preserve desired tracking properties for nonlinear systems equipped with base reference-tracking controllers. Then, we show how to optimize transient costs while searching within subsets of tracking controllers that incorporate expressive neural network models. Furthermore, we analyze the robustness of our method to uncertainties in the underlying system dynamics. Numerical simulations on a robotic system demonstrate the advantages of our approach over the standard PB framework.

Title: LMLCC-Net: A Semi-Supervised Deep Learning Model for Lung Nodule Malignancy Prediction from CT Scans using a Novel Hounsfield Unit-Based Intensity Filtering
Authors: Tasnia Binte Mamun, Adhora Madhuri, Nusaiba Sobir, Taufiq Hasan
Abstract: Lung cancer is the leading cause of patient mortality in the world. Early diagnosis of malignant pulmonary nodules in CT images can have a significant impact on reducing disease mortality and morbidity. In this work, we propose LMLCC-Net, a novel deep learning framework for classifying nodules from CT scan images using a 3D CNN, considering Hounsfield Unit (HU)-based intensity filtering. Benign and malignant nodules have significant differences in their intensity profile of HU, which was not exploited in the literature. Our method considers the intensity pattern as well as the texture for the prediction of malignancies. LMLCC-Net extracts features from multiple branches that each use a separate learnable HU-based intensity filtering stage. Various combinations of branches and learnable ranges of filters were explored to finally produce the best-performing model. In addition, we propose a semi-supervised learning scheme for labeling ambiguous cases and also developed a lightweight model to classify the nodules. The experimental evaluations are carried out on the LUNA16 dataset. The proposed LMLCC-Net was evaluated using the LUNA16 dataset. Our proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 91.96%, a sensitivity of 92.94%, and an area under the curve of 94.07%, showing improved performance compared to existing methods The proposed method can have a significant impact in helping radiologists in the classification of pulmonary nodules and improving patient care.

Title: Generalizable cardiac substructures segmentation from contrast and non-contrast CTs using pretrained transformers
Authors: Aneesh Rangnekar, Nikhil Mankuzhy, Jonas Willmann, Chloe Choi, Abraham Wu, Maria Thor, Andreas Rimner, Harini Veeraraghavan
Abstract: Automated AI segmentations for radiation treatment planning deteriorate when applied to cases with different characteristics than the training dataset. We developed a hybrid transformer convolutional network to segment cardiac substructures in lung and breast cancer patients with varying imaging contrasts and scan positions. Cohort I (56 contrast-enhanced CT [CECT], 124 non-contrast CT [NCCT] scans from lung cancer patients, supine position) was used to train an oracle model (180 cases), contrast-only model (56 CECTs), and balanced model (32 CECT, 32 NCCT). All models were evaluated on 60 held-out cohort I patients and 66 cohort II breast cancer patients (45 supine, 21 prone). Accuracy was measured using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95), and dosimetric metrics, with TotalSegmentator as benchmark. Oracle and balanced models achieved similar accuracy (DSC: Oracle vs Balanced: Cohort I: 0.84 $\pm$ 0.10 vs 0.82 $\pm$ 0.10; Cohort II: 0.81 $\pm$ 0.12 vs 0.80 $\pm$ 0.13), both outperforming TotalSegmentator and the contrast-only models. The balanced model, using 64% fewer training cases, produced dosimetrically equivalent contours to manual delineations. It was robust to contrast variations (6 out of 8 substructures) and positioning variations (5 out of 8 substructures), with low correlation to patient age or body mass index. Our balanced model demonstrated robust geometric and dosimetric accuracy across varying imaging protocols and patient characteristics, which is essential for clinical deployment. Combining pretraining with balanced NCCT/CECT distribution enabled reliable segmentation with substantially fewer labeled cases than conventional approaches.

Title: LCB-CV-UNet: Enhanced Detector for High Dynamic Range Radar Signals
Authors: Yanbin Wang, Xingyu Chen, Yumiao Wang, Xiang Wang, Chuanfei Zang, Guolong Cui, Jiahuan Liu
Abstract: We propose the LCB-CV-UNet to tackle performance degradation caused by High Dynamic Range (HDR) radar signals. Initially, a hardware-efficient, plug-and-play module named Logarithmic Connect Block (LCB) is proposed as a phase coherence preserving solution to address the inherent challenges in handling HDR features. Then, we propose the Dual Hybrid Dataset Construction method to generate a semi-synthetic dataset, approximating typical HDR signal scenarios with adjustable target distributions. Simulation results show about 1% total detection probability improvement with under 0.9% computational complexity added compared with the baseline. Furthermore, it excels 5% over the baseline at the range in 11-13 dB signal-to-noise ratio typical for urban targets. Finally, the real experiment validates the practicality of our model.

Title: Unlocking Transmission Flexibility under Uncertainty: Getting Dynamic Line Ratings into Electricity Markets
Authors: Zhiyi Zhou, Christoph Graf, Yury Dvorkin
Abstract: Static transmission line ratings may lead to underutilization of line capacity due to overly conservative assumptions. Grid-enhancing technologies (GETs) such as dynamic line ratings (DLRs), which adjust line capacity based on real-time conditions, are a techno-economically viable alternative to increase the utilization of existing power lines. Nonetheless, their adoption has been slow, partly due to the absence of operational tools that effectively account for simultaneous impacts on dispatch and pricing. In this paper, we represent transmission capacity with DLRs as a stock-like resource with time-variant interdependency, which is modeled via an approximation of line temperature evolution process, decoupling the impacts of ambient weather conditions and power flow on transmission line temperature and thus capacity. We integrate DLRs into a multi-period DC optimal power flow problem, with chance constrains addressing correlated uncertainty in DLRs and renewable generation. This yields non-convex problems that we transform into a tractable convex form by linearization. We derive locational marginal energy and ancillary services prices consistent with a competitive equilibrium. Numerical experiments on the 11-zone and 1814-node NYISO systems demonstrate its performance, including impacts on dispatch, pricing, and marginal carbon emissions.

Title: Pinching-Antenna Systems-Enabled Multi-User Communications: Transmission Structures and Beamforming Optimization
Authors: Jingjing Zhao, Haowen Song, Xidong Mu, Kaiquan Cai, Yanbo Zhu, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems (PASS) represent an innovative advancement in flexible-antenna technologies, aimed at significantly improving wireless communications by ensuring reliable line-of-sight connections and dynamic antenna array reconfigurations. To employ multi-waveguide PASS in multi-user communications, three practical transmission structures are proposed, namely waveguide multiplexing (WM), waveguide division (WD), and waveguide switching (WS). Based on the proposed structures, the joint baseband signal processing and pinching beamforming design is studied for a general multi-group multicast communication system, with the unicast communication encompassed as a special case. A max-min fairness problem is formulated for each proposed transmission structure, subject to the maximum transmit power constraint. For WM, to solve the highly-coupled and non-convex MMF problem with complex exponential and fractional expressions, a penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is invoked for obtaining locally optimal solutions. Specifically, the augmented Lagrangian relaxation is first applied to alleviate the stringent coupling constraints, which is followed by the block decomposition over the resulting augmented Lagrangian function. Then, the proposed PDD-based algorithm is extended to solve the MMF problem for both WD and WS. Furthermore, a low-complexity algorithm is proposed for the unicast case employing the WS structure, by simultaneously aligning the signal phases and minimizing the large-scale path loss at each user. Finally, numerical results reveal that: 1) the MMF performance is significantly improved by employing the PASS compared to conventional fixed-position antenna systems; 2) WS and WM are suitable for unicast and multicast communications, respectively; 3) the performance gap between WD and WM can be significantly alleviated when the users are geographically isolated.

Title: Geometric Decentralized Stability Certificate for Power Systems Based on Projecting DW Shells
Authors: Linbin Huang, Liangxiao Luo, Ruohan Leng, Huanhai Xin, Dan Wang, Florian Dörfler
Abstract: The development of decentralized stability conditions has gained considerable attention due to the need to analyze multi-agent network systems, such as heterogeneous multi-converter power systems. A recent advance is the application of the small-phase theorem, which extends the passivity theory. However, it requires the transfer function matrix to be sectorial, which may not hold in some frequency range and will result in conservativeness. To address this issue, this paper proposes a geometric decentralized stability condition based on Davis-Wielandt (DW) shell and its projections. Our approach provides a geometric interpretation of the small-gain and small-phase theorems and enables decentralized stability analysis of power systems. It serves as a visualization method to understand the closed-loop interactions and assess the stability of large-scale network systems in a scalable and modular manner.

Title: Graphon Signal Processing for Spiking and Biological Neural Networks
Authors: Takuma Sumi, Georgi S. Medvedev
Abstract: Graph Signal Processing (GSP) extends classical signal processing to signals defined on graphs, enabling filtering, spectral analysis, and sampling of data generated by networks of various kinds. Graphon Signal Processing (GnSP) develops this framework further by employing the theory of graphons. Graphons are measurable functions on the unit square that represent graphs and limits of convergent graph sequences. The use of graphons provides stability of GSP methods to stochastic variability in network data and improves computational efficiency for very large networks. We use GnSP to address the stimulus identification problem (SIP) in computational and biological neural networks. The SIP is an inverse problem that aims to infer the unknown stimulus s from the observed network output f. We first validate the approach in spiking neural network simulations and then analyze calcium imaging recordings. Graphon-based spectral projections yield trial-invariant, lowdimensional embeddings that improve stimulus classification over Principal Component Analysis and discrete GSP baselines. The embeddings remain stable under variations in network stochasticity, providing robustness to different network sizes and noise levels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of GnSP to biological neural networks, opening new avenues for graphon-based analysis in neuroscience.

Title: Analysis and Control of Acoustic Emissions from Marine Energy Converters
Authors: Jiaqin He, Max Malyi, Jonathan Shek
Abstract: Environmental licensing related to underwater acoustic emissions represents a critical bottleneck for the commercial deployment of marine renewable energy. This study presents a control engineering framework to mitigate acoustic risks from tidal current converters without compromising project viability. A MATLAB/Simulink model of a tidal current converter was utilised to evaluate two distinct mitigation tiers: (1) architectural modification, comparing a geared induction generator against a direct-drive permanent magnet synchronous generator, and (2) operational control, analysing the impact of switching frequencies and maximum power point tracking coefficient tuning. Results indicate that lowering switching frequencies is ineffective, increasing power electronic losses by over 2000% with negligible acoustic benefit. Conversely, the direct-drive permanent magnet synchronous generator architecture reduced sound pressure levels, effectively eliminating mechanical tonal noise. For existing geared systems, de-tuning the maximum power point tracking coefficient by a factor of 1.2 reduced the probability of exceeding temporary threshold shift limits for marine mammals, with a quantified energy yield reduction of 3.58%. These findings propose a hierarchical mitigation strategy: selecting direct-drive topologies for acoustically sensitive sites, and utilising maximum power point tracking coefficient based power curtailment as a transient operational mode during critical biological migration periods.

Title: Bounds of Validity for Bifurcations of Equilibria in a Class of Networked Dynamical Systems
Authors: Pranav Gupta, Ravi Banavar, Anastasia Bizyaeva
Abstract: Local bifurcation analysis plays a central role in understanding qualitative transitions in networked nonlinear dynamical systems, including dynamic neural network and opinion dynamics models. In this article we establish explicit bounds of validity for the classification of bifurcation diagrams in two classes of continuous-time networked dynamical systems, analogous in structure to the Hopfield and the Firing Rate dynamic neural network models. Our approach leverages recent advances in computing the bounds for the validity of Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, a reduction method widely employed in nonlinear systems analysis. Using these bounds we rigorously characterize neighborhoods around bifurcation points where predictions from reduced-order models remain reliable. We further demonstrate how these bounds can be applied to an illustrative family of nonlinear opinion dynamics on k-regular graphs, which emerges as a special case of the general framework. These results provide new analytical tools for quantifying the robustness of bifurcation phenomena in dynamics over networked systems and highlight the interplay between network structure and nonlinear dynamical behavior.

With loads from 20 {\Omega} to 500 k{\Omega}, it achieves 0.5% error and up to 71.1 dB SNR.

Title: Hopfield Neural Networks for Online Constrained Parameter Estimation with Time-Varying Dynamics and Disturbances
Authors: Miguel Pedro Silva
Abstract: This paper proposes two projector-based Hopfield neural network (HNN) estimators for online, constrained parameter estimation under time-varying data, additive disturbances, and slowly drifting physical parameters. The first is a constraint-aware HNN that enforces linear equalities and inequalities (via slack neurons) and continuously tracks the constrained least-squares target. The second augments the state with compensation neurons and a concatenated regressor to absorb bias-like disturbance components within the same energy function. For both estimators we establish global uniform ultimate boundedness with explicit convergence rate and ultimate bound, and we derive practical tuning rules that link the three design gains to closed-loop bandwidth and steady-state accuracy. We also introduce an online identifiability monitor that adapts the constraint weight and time step, and, when needed, projects updates onto identifiable subspaces to prevent drift in poorly excited directions...

Abstract: Quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT) imaging provides myelin-sensitive biomarkers, such as the pool size ratio (PSR), which is valuable for multiple sclerosis (MS) assessment. However, qMT requires specialized 20-30 minute scans. We propose DEMIST to synthesize PSR maps from standard T1w and FLAIR images using a 3D latent diffusion model with three complementary conditioning mechanisms. Our approach has two stages: first, we train separate autoencoders for PSR and anatomical images to learn aligned latent representations. Second, we train a conditional diffusion model in this latent space on top of a frozen diffusion foundation backbone. Conditioning is decoupled into: (i) \textbf{semantic} tokens via cross-attention, (ii) \textbf{spatial} per-scale residual hints via a 3D ControlNet branch, and (iii) \textbf{adaptive} LoRA-modulated attention. We include edge-aware loss terms to preserve lesion boundaries and alignment losses to maintain quantitative consistency, while keeping the number of trainable parameters low and retaining the inductive bias of the pretrained model. We evaluate on 163 scans from 99 subjects using 5-fold cross-validation. Our method outperforms VAE, GAN and diffusion baselines on multiple metrics, producing sharper boundaries and better quantitative agreement with ground truth.

Title: Diffusion Algorithm for Metalens Optical Aberration Correction
Authors: Harshana Weligampola, Yuanrui Chen, Weiheng Tang, Qi Guo, Stanley H. Chan
Abstract: Metalenses offer a path toward creating ultra-thin optical systems, but they inherently suffer from severe, spatially varying optical aberrations, especially chromatic aberration, which makes image reconstruction a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel algorithmic solution to this problem, designed to reconstruct a sharp, full-color image from two inputs: a sharp, bandpass-filtered grayscale ``structure image'' and a heavily distorted ``color cue'' image, both captured by the metalens system. Our method utilizes a dual-branch diffusion model, built upon a pre-trained Stable Diffusion XL framework, to fuse information from the two inputs. We demonstrate through quantitative and qualitative comparisons that our approach significantly outperforms existing deblurring and pansharpening methods, effectively restoring high-frequency details while accurately colorizing the image.

Title: Describing Functions and Phase Response Curves of Excitable Systems
Authors: Robin Wroblowski, Rodolphe Sepulchre
Abstract: The describing function (DF) and phase response curve (PRC) are classical tools for the analysis of feedback oscillations and rhythmic behaviors, widely used across control engineering, biology, and neuroscience. These tools are known to have limitations in networks of relaxation oscillators and excitable systems. For this reason, the paper proposes a novel approach tailored to excitable systems. Our analysis focuses on the discrete-event operator mapping input trains of events to output trains of events. The methodology is illustrated on the excitability model of Hodgkin-Huxley. The proposed framework provides a basis for designing and analyzing central pattern generators in networks of excitable neurons, with direct relevance to neuromorphic control and neurophysiology.

Title: Observer Design for Singularly Perturbed Linear Networked Control Systems Subject to Measurement Noise
Authors: Weixuan Wang, Alejandro I. Maass, Dragan Nešić, Ying Tan, Romain Postoyan, W.P.M.H. Heemels
Abstract: This paper addresses the emulation-based observer design for linear networked control systems (NCS) operating at two time scales in the presence of measurement noise. The system is formulated as a hybrid singularly perturbed dynamical system, enabling the systematic use of singular perturbation techniques to derive explicit bounds on the maximum allowable transmission intervals (MATI) for both fast and slow communication channels. Under the resulting conditions, the proposed observer guarantees that the estimation error satisfies a global exponential derivative-input-to-state stability (DISS)-like property, where the ultimate bound scales proportionally with the magnitudes of the measurement noise and the time derivative of the control input. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated through a numerical example.

Title: Connectivity-Preserving Multi-Agent Area Coverage via Optimal-Transport-Based Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC)
Authors: Kooktae Lee, Ethan Brook
Abstract: Multi-agent systems play a central role in area coverage tasks across search-and-rescue, environmental monitoring, and precision agriculture. Achieving non-uniform coverage, where spatial priorities vary across the domain, requires coordinating agents while respecting dynamic and communication constraints. Density-driven approaches can distribute agents according to a prescribed reference density, but existing methods do not ensure connectivity. This limitation often leads to communication loss, reduced coordination, and degraded coverage performance. This letter introduces a connectivity-preserving extension of the Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC) framework. The coverage objective, defined using the Wasserstein distance between the agent distribution and the reference density, admits a convex quadratic program formulation. Communication constraints are incorporated through a smooth connectivity penalty, which maintains strict convexity, supports distributed implementation, and preserves inter-agent communication without imposing rigid formations. Simulation studies show that the proposed method consistently maintains connectivity, improves convergence speed, and enhances non-uniform coverage quality compared with density-driven schemes that do not incorporate explicit connectivity considerations.

Title: Multi-Hypotheses Ego-Tracking for Resilient Navigation
Authors: Peter Iwer Hoedt Karstensen, Roberto Galeazzi
Abstract: Autonomous robots relying on radio frequency (RF)-based localization such as global navigation satellite system (GNSS), ultra-wide band (UWB), and 5G integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) are vulnerable to spoofing and sensor manipulation. This paper presents a resilient navigation architecture that combines multi-hypothesis estimation with a Poisson binomial windowed-count detector for anomaly identification and isolation. A state machine coordinates transitions between operation, diagnosis, and mitigation, enabling adaptive response to adversarial conditions. When attacks are detected, trajectory re-planning based on differential flatness allows information-gathering maneuvers minimizing performance loss. Case studies demonstrate effective detection of biased sensors, maintenance of state estimation, and recovery of nominal operation under persistent spoofing attacks

Title: SAFE-IMM: Robust and Lightweight Radar-Based Object Tracking on Mobile Platforms
Authors: Dnyandeep Mandaokar, Bernhard Rinner
Abstract: Tracking maneuvering targets requires estimators that are both responsive and robust. Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) filters are a standard tracking approach, but fusing models via Gaussian mixtures can lag during maneuvers. Recent winnertakes-all (WTA) approaches react quickly but may produce discontinuities. We propose SAFE-IMM, a lightweight IMM variant for tracking on mobile and resource-limited platforms with a safe covariance-aware gate that permits WTA only when the implied jump from the mixture to the winner is provably bounded. In simulations and on nuScenes front-radar data, SAFE-IMM achieves high accuracy at real-time rates, reducing ID switches while maintaining competitive performance. The method is simple to integrate, numerically stable, and clutter-robust, offering a practical balance between responsiveness and smoothness.

Title: Earth Observation Satellite Scheduling with Graph Neural Networks and Monte Carlo Tree Search
Authors: Antoine Jacquet, Guillaume Infantes, Emmanuel Benazera, Vincent Baudoui, Jonathan Guerra, Stéphanie Roussel
Abstract: Earth Observation Satellite Planning (EOSP) is a difficult optimization problem with considerable practical interest. A set of requested observations must be scheduled on an agile Earth observation satellite while respecting constraints on their visibility window, as well as maneuver constraints that impose varying delays between successive observations. In addition, the problem is largely oversubscribed: there are much more candidate observations than can possibly be achieved. Therefore, one must select the set of observations that will be performed while maximizing their cumulative benefit and propose a feasible schedule for these observations. As previous work mostly focused on heuristic and iterative search algorithms, this paper presents a new technique for selecting and scheduling observations based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). GNNs are used to extract relevant information from the graphs representing instances of the EOSP, and DRL drives the search for optimal schedules. A post-learning search step based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is added that is able to find even better solutions. Experiments show that it is able to learn on small problem instances and generalize to larger real-world instances, with very competitive performance compared to traditional approaches.

Title: Improved Visually Prompted Keyword Localisation in Real Low-Resource Settings
Authors: Leanne Nortje, Dan Oneata, Gabriel Pirlogeanu, Herman Kamper
Abstract: Given an image query, visually prompted keyword localisation (VPKL) aims to find occurrences of the depicted word in a speech collection. This can be useful when transcriptions are not available for a low-resource language (e.g. if it is unwritten). Previous work showed that VPKL can be performed with a visually grounded speech model trained on paired images and unlabelled speech. But all experiments were done on English. Moreover, transcriptions were used to get positive and negative pairs for the contrastive loss. This paper introduces a few-shot learning scheme to mine pairs automatically without transcriptions. On English, this results in only a small drop in performance. We also - for the first time - consider VPKL on a real low-resource language, Yoruba. While scores are reasonable, here we see a bigger drop in performance compared to using ground truth pairs because the mining is less accurate in Yoruba.

Title: Spike Encoding for Environmental Sound: A Comparative Benchmark
Authors: Andres Larroza, Javier Naranjo-Alcazar, Vicent Ortiz, Maximo Cobos, Pedro Zuccarello
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer energy efficient processing suitable for edge applications, but conventional sensor data must first be converted into spike trains for neuromorphic processing. Environmental sound, including urban soundscapes, poses challenges due to variable frequencies, background noise, and overlapping acoustic events, while most spike based audio encoding research has focused on speech. This paper analyzes three spike encoding methods, Threshold Adaptive Encoding (TAE), Step Forward (SF), and Moving Window (MW) across three datasets: ESC10, UrbanSound8K, and TAU Urban Acoustic Scenes. Our multiband analysis shows that TAE consistently outperforms SF and MW in reconstruction quality, both per frequency band and per class across datasets. Moreover, TAE yields the lowest spike firing rates, indicating superior energy efficiency. For downstream environmental sound classification with a standard SNN, TAE also achieves the best performance among the compared encoders. Overall, this work provides foundational insights and a comparative benchmark to guide the selection of spike encoders for neuromorphic environmental sound processing.

Title: One-Step Diffusion-Based Image Compression with Semantic Distillation
Authors: Naifu Xue, Zhaoyang Jia, Jiahao Li, Bin Li, Yuan Zhang, Yan Lu
Abstract: While recent diffusion-based generative image codecs have shown impressive performance, their iterative sampling process introduces unpleasing latency. In this work, we revisit the design of a diffusion-based codec and argue that multi-step sampling is not necessary for generative compression. Based on this insight, we propose OneDC, a One-step Diffusion-based generative image Codec -- that integrates a latent compression module with a one-step diffusion generator. Recognizing the critical role of semantic guidance in one-step diffusion, we propose using the hyperprior as a semantic signal, overcoming the limitations of text prompts in representing complex visual content. To further enhance the semantic capability of the hyperprior, we introduce a semantic distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge from a pretrained generative tokenizer to the hyperprior codec. Additionally, we adopt a hybrid pixel- and latent-domain optimization to jointly enhance both reconstruction fidelity and perceptual realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OneDC achieves SOTA perceptual quality even with one-step generation, offering over 39% bitrate reduction and 20x faster decoding compared to prior multi-step diffusion-based codecs.

Title: Alignment of large language models with constrained learning
Authors: Botong Zhang, Shuo Li, Ignacio Hounie, Osbert Bastani, Dongsheng Ding, Alejandro Ribeiro
Abstract: We study the problem of computing an optimal large language model (LLM) policy for the constrained alignment problem, where the goal is to maximize a primary reward objective while satisfying constraints on secondary utilities. Despite the popularity of Lagrangian-based LLM policy search in constrained alignment, iterative primal-dual methods often fail to converge, and non-iterative dual-based methods do not achieve optimality in the LLM parameter space. To address these challenges, we employ Lagrangian duality to develop an iterative dual-based alignment method that alternates between updating the LLM policy via Lagrangian maximization and updating the dual variable via dual descent. In theory, we characterize the primal-dual gap between the primal value in the distribution space and the dual value in the LLM parameter space. We further quantify the optimality gap of the learned LLM policies at near-optimal dual variables with respect to both the objective and the constraint functions. These results prove that dual-based alignment methods can find an optimal constrained LLM policy, up to an LLM parametrization gap. We demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our approach through extensive experiments conducted on the PKU-SafeRLHF and Anthropic HH-RLHF datasets.

Title: Rapid and Safe Trajectory Planning over Diverse Scenes through Diffusion Composition
Authors: Wule Mao, Zhouheng Li, Yunhao Luo, Yilun Du, Lei Xie
Abstract: Safe trajectory planning in complex environments must balance stringent collision avoidance with real-time efficiency, which is a long-standing challenge in robotics. In this work, we present a diffusion-based trajectory planning framework that is both rapid and safe. First, we introduce a scene-agnostic, MPC-based data generation pipeline that efficiently produces large volumes of kinematically feasible trajectories. Building on this dataset, our integrated diffusion planner maps raw onboard sensor inputs directly to kinematically feasible trajectories, enabling efficient inference while maintaining strong collision avoidance. To generalize to diverse, previously unseen scenarios, we compose diffusion models at test time, enabling safe behavior without additional training. We further propose a lightweight, rule-based safety filter that, from the candidate set, selects the trajectory meeting safety and kinematic-feasibility requirements. Across seen and unseen settings, the proposed method delivers real-time-capable inference with high safety and stability. Experiments on an F1TENTH vehicle demonstrate practicality on real hardware.

Abstract: Plant traits such as leaf carbon content and leaf mass are essential variables in the study of biodiversity and climate change. However, conventional field sampling cannot feasibly cover trait variation at ecologically meaningful spatial scales. Machine learning represents a valuable solution for plant trait prediction across ecosystems, leveraging hyperspectral data from remote sensing. Nevertheless, trait prediction from hyperspectral data is challenged by label scarcity and substantial domain shifts (\eg across sensors, ecological distributions), requiring robust cross-domain methods. Here, we present GreenHyperSpectra, a pretraining dataset encompassing real-world cross-sensor and cross-ecosystem samples designed to benchmark trait prediction with semi- and self-supervised methods. We adopt an evaluation framework encompassing in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. We successfully leverage GreenHyperSpectra to pretrain label-efficient multi-output regression models that outperform the state-of-the-art supervised baseline. Our empirical analyses demonstrate substantial improvements in learning spectral representations for trait prediction, establishing a comprehensive methodological framework to catalyze research at the intersection of representation learning and plant functional traits assessment.

Title: Action Chunking and Exploratory Data Collection Yield Exponential Improvements in Behavior Cloning for Continuous Control
Authors: Thomas T. Zhang, Daniel Pfrommer, Chaoyi Pan, Nikolai Matni, Max Simchowitz
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical analysis of two of the most impactful interventions in modern learning from demonstration in robotics and continuous control: the practice of action-chunking (predicting sequences of actions in open-loop) and exploratory augmentation of expert demonstrations. Though recent results show that learning from demonstration, also known as imitation learning (IL), can suffer errors that compound exponentially with task horizon in continuous settings, we demonstrate that action chunking and exploratory data collection circumvent exponential compounding errors in different regimes. Our results identify control-theoretic stability as the key mechanism underlying the benefits of these interventions. On the empirical side, we validate our predictions and the role of control-theoretic stability through experimentation on popular robot learning benchmarks. On the theoretical side, we demonstrate that the control-theoretic lens provides fine-grained insights into how compounding error arises, leading to tighter statistical guarantees on imitation learning error when these interventions are applied than previous techniques based on information-theoretic considerations alone.

Title: Collaborative Large Language Model Inference via Resource-Aware Parallel Speculative Decoding
Authors: Jungyeon Koh, Hyun Jong Yang
Abstract: The growing demand for on-device large language model (LLM) inference highlights the need for efficient mobile edge computing (MEC) solutions, especially in resource-constrained settings. Speculative decoding offers a promising solution by partitioning token generation between a lightweight draft model on mobile devices and a powerful target model on edge servers, but suffers from communication overhead and asynchronous delays. This paper is the first to propose a unified framework that jointly optimizes user association and resource allocation (UARA) to support efficient parallel speculative decoding. We solve the UARA problem using a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm. To evaluate our approach under realistic conditions, we conduct experiments using the Sionna simulator. Results show that our method achieves up to 28.0% and an average of 23.7% reduction in end-to-end latency without compromising inference accuracy, enabling scalable and low-latency LLM services in MEC systems.

Title: HardFlow: Hard-Constrained Sampling for Flow-Matching Models via Trajectory Optimization
Authors: Zeyang Li, Kaveh Alim, Navid Azizan
Abstract: Diffusion and flow-matching have emerged as powerful methodologies for generative modeling, with remarkable success in capturing complex data distributions and enabling flexible guidance at inference time. Many downstream applications, however, demand enforcing hard constraints on generated samples (for example, robot trajectories must avoid obstacles), a requirement that goes beyond simple guidance. Prevailing projection-based approaches constrain the entire sampling path to the constraint manifold, which is overly restrictive and degrades sample quality. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that reformulates hard-constrained sampling as a trajectory optimization problem. Our key insight is to leverage numerical optimal control to steer the sampling trajectory so that constraints are satisfied precisely at the terminal time. By exploiting the underlying structure of flow-matching models and adopting techniques from model predictive control, we transform this otherwise complex constrained optimization problem into a tractable surrogate that can be solved efficiently and effectively. Furthermore, this trajectory optimization perspective offers significant flexibility beyond mere constraint satisfaction, allowing for the inclusion of integral costs to minimize distribution shift and terminal objectives to further enhance sample quality, all within a unified framework. We provide a control-theoretic analysis of our method, establishing bounds on the approximation error between our tractable surrogate and the ideal formulation. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including robotics (planning), partial differential equations (boundary control), and vision (text-guided image editing), demonstrate that our algorithm, which we name $\textit{HardFlow}$, substantially outperforms existing methods in both constraint satisfaction and sample quality.

Title: Nonuniform-Grid Markov Chain Approximation of Continuous Processes with Time-Linear Moments
Authors: Do Hyun Kim, Ahmet Cetinkaya
Abstract: We propose a method to approximate continuous-time, continuous-state stochastic processes by a discrete-time Markov chain defined on a nonuniform grid. Our method provides exact moment matching for processes whose first and second moments are linear functions of time. In particular, we show that, under certain conditions, the transition probabilities of a Markov chain can be chosen so that its first two moments match prescribed linear functions of time. These conditions depend on the grid points of the Markov chain and the coefficients of the linear mean and variance functions. Our proof relies on two recurrence relations for the expectation and variance across time. This approach enables simulation-based numerical analysis of continuous processes while preserving their key characteristics. We illustrate its efficacy by approximating continuous processes describing heat diffusion and geometric Brownian motion (GBM). For heat diffusion, we show that the heat profile at a set of points can be investigated by embedding those points inside the nonuniform grid of our Markov chain. For GBM, numerical simulations demonstrate that our approach, combined with suitable nonuniform grids, yields accurate approximations, with consistently small empirical Wasserstein-1 distances at long time horizons.
