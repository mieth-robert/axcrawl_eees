Title: Application of Machine Learning Models for Carbon Monoxide and Nitrogen Oxides Emission Prediction in Gas Turbines
Authors: Kamyar Zeinalipour, Laure Barriere, David Ghelardi, Marco Gori
Abstract: This paper addresses the environmental impacts linked to hazardous emissions from gas turbines, with a specific focus on employing various machine learning (ML) models to predict the emissions of Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) as part of a Predictive Emission Monitoring System (PEMS). We employ a comprehensive approach using multiple predictive models to offer insights on enhancing regulatory compliance and optimizing operational parameters to reduce environmental effects effectively. Our investigation explores a range of machine learning models including linear models, ensemble methods, and neural networks. The models we assess include Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, XGBoost, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). This analysis provides a comparative overview of the performance of these ML models in estimating CO and NOx emissions from gas turbines, aiming to highlight the most effective techniques for this critical task. Accurate ML models for predicting gas turbine emissions help reduce environmental impact by enabling real-time adjustments and supporting effective emission control strategies, thus promoting sustainability.

Title: Advancing Brainwave-Based Biometrics: A Large-Scale, Multi-Session Evaluation
Authors: Matin Fallahi, Patricia Arias-Cabarcos, Thorsten Strufe
Abstract: The field of brainwave-based biometrics has gained attention for its potential to revolutionize user authentication through hands-free interaction, resistance to shoulder surfing, continuous authentication, and revocability. However, current research often relies on single-session or limited-session datasets with fewer than 55 subjects, raising concerns about generalizability and robustness. To address this gap, we conducted a large-scale study using a public brainwave dataset of 345 subjects and over 6,000 sessions (averaging 17 per subject) recorded over five years with three headsets. Our results reveal that deep learning approaches outperform classic feature extraction methods by 16.4\% in Equal Error Rates (EER) and comparing features using a simple cosine distance metric outperforms binary classifiers, which require extra negative samples for training. We also observe EER degrades over time (e.g., 7.7\% after 1 day to 19.69\% after a year). Therefore, it is necessary to reinforce the enrollment set after successful login attempts. Moreover, we demonstrate that fewer brainwave measurement sensors can be used, with an acceptable increase in EER, which is necessary for transitioning from medical-grade to affordable consumer-grade devices. Finally, we compared our findings with prior work on brainwave authentication and industrial biometric standards. While our performance is comparable or superior to prior work through the use of Supervised Contrastive Learning, standards remain unmet. However, we project that achieving industrial standards will be possible by training the feature extractor with at least 1,500 subjects. Moreover, we open-sourced our analysis code to promote further research.

Title: Hybrid Near-field and Far-field Localization with Holographic MIMO
Authors: Mengyuan Cao, Haobo Zhang, Yonina C. Eldar, Hongliang Zhang
Abstract: Due to its ability to precisely control wireless beams, holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) is expected to be a promising solution to achieve high-accuracy localization. However, as the scale of HMIMO increases to improve beam control capability, the corresponding near-field (NF) region expands, indicating that users may exist in both NF and far-field (FF) regions with different electromagnetic transmission characteristics. As a result, existing methods for pure NF or FF localization are no longer applicable. We consider a hybrid NF and FF localization scenario in this paper, where a base station (BS) locates multiple users in both NF and FF regions with the aid of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), which is a low-cost implementation of HMIMO. In such a scenario, it is difficult to locate the users and optimize the RIS phase shifts because whether the location of the user is in the NF or FF region is unknown, and the channels of different users are coupled. To tackle this challenge, we propose a RIS-enabled localization method that searches the users in both NF and FF regions and tackles the coupling issue by jointly estimating all user locations. We derive the localization error bound by considering the channel coupling and propose an RIS phase shift optimization algorithm that minimizes the derived bound. Simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed method and demonstrate the performance gain compared to pure NF and FF techniques.

Title: On the challenges of detecting MCI using EEG in the wild
Authors: Aayush Mishra, David Joffe, Sankara Surendra Telidevara, David S Oakley, Anqi Liu
Abstract: Recent studies have shown promising results in the detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) using easily accessible Electroencephalogram (EEG) data which would help administer early and effective treatment for dementia patients. However, the reliability and practicality of such systems remains unclear. In this work, we investigate the potential limitations and challenges in developing a robust MCI detection method using two contrasting datasets: 1) CAUEEG, collected and annotated by expert neurologists in controlled settings and 2) GENEEG, a new dataset collected and annotated in general practice clinics, a setting where routine MCI diagnoses are typically made. We find that training on small datasets, as is done by most previous works, tends to produce high variance models that make overconfident predictions, and are unreliable in practice. Additionally, distribution shifts between datasets make cross-domain generalization challenging. Finally, we show that MCI detection using EEG may suffer from fundamental limitations because of the overlapping nature of feature distributions with control groups. We call for more effort in high-quality data collection in actionable settings (like general practice clinics) to make progress towards this salient goal of non-invasive MCI detection.

Title: SOLAS: Superpositioning an Optical Lens in Automotive Simulation
Authors: Daniel Jakab, Julian Barthel, Alexander Braun, Reenu Mohandas, Brian Michael Deegan, Mahendar Kumbham, Dara Molloy, Fiachra Collins, Anthony Scanlan, Ciarán Eising
Abstract: Automotive Simulation is a potentially cost-effective strategy to identify and test corner case scenarios in automotive perception. Recent work has shown a significant shift in creating realistic synthetic data for road traffic scenarios using a video graphics engine. However, a gap exists in modeling realistic optical aberrations associated with cameras in automotive simulation. This paper builds on the concept from existing literature to model optical degradations in simulated environments using the Python-based ray-tracing library KrakenOS. As a novel pipeline, we degrade automotive fisheye simulation using an optical doublet with +/-2 deg Field of View (FOV), introducing realistic optical artifacts into two simulation images from SynWoodscape and Parallel Domain Woodscape. We evaluate KrakenOS by calculating the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), which averaged around 0.023 across the RGB light spectrum compared to Ansys Zemax OpticStudio, an industrial benchmark for optical design and simulation. Lastly, we measure the image sharpness of the degraded simulation using the ISO12233:2023 Slanted Edge Method and show how both qualitative and measured results indicate the extent of the spatial variation in image sharpness from the periphery to the center of the degradations.

Title: Split-Aperture Phased Array Radar Resource Management for Tracking Tasks
Authors: Pepijn B. Cox, Wim L. van Rossum
Abstract: The next generation of radar systems will include advanced digital front-end technology in the apertures allowing for spatially subdividing radar tasks over the array, the so-called split-aperture phased array (SAPA) concept. The goal of this paper is to introduce radar resource management for the SAPA concept and to demonstrate the added benefit of the SAPA concept for active tracking tasks. To do so, the radar resource management problem is formulated and solved by employing the quality of service based resource allocation model (Q-RAM) framework. As active tracking tasks may be scheduled simultaneously, the resource allocation of tasks becomes dependent on the other tasks. The solution to the resource allocation problem is obtained by introducing the adaptive fast traversal algorithm combined with a three dimensional strip packing algorithm to handle task dependencies. It will be demonstrated by a simulation example that the SAPA concept can significantly increase the number of active tracks of a multifunction radar system compared to scheduling tasks sequentially.

Title: Multi-Task Over-the-Air Federated Learning in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems
Authors: Chen Chen, Emil Björnson, Carlo Fischione
Abstract: Wireless devices are expected to provide a wide range of AI services in 6G networks. The increasing computing capabilities of wireless devices and the surge of wireless data motivate the use of privacy-preserving federated learning (FL). In contrast to centralized learning that requires sending large amounts of raw data during uplink transmission, only local model parameters are uploaded in FL. Meanwhile, over-the-air (OtA) computation is considered as a communication-efficient solution for fast FL model aggregation by exploiting the superposition properties of wireless multi-access channels. The required communication resources in OtA FL do not scale with the number of FL devices. However, OtA FL is significantly affected by the uneven signal attenuation experienced by different FL devices. Moreover, the coexistence of multiple FL groups with different FL tasks brings about inter-group interference. These challenges cannot be well addressed by conventional cellular network architectures. Recently, Cell-free Massive MIMO (mMIMO) has emerged as a promising technology to provide uniform coverage and high rates via joint coherent transmission. In this paper, we investigate multi-task OtA FL in Cell-free mMIMO systems. We propose optimal designs of transmit coefficients and receive combining at different levels of cooperation among the access points, aiming to minimize the sum of OtA model aggregation errors across all FL groups. Numerical results demonstrate that Cell-free mMIMO significantly outperforms conventional Cellular mMIMO in term of the FL convergence performance by operating at appropriate cooperation levels.

Title: A framework for IoT-Enabled Smart Agriculture
Authors: Nsengiyumva Wilberforce, Johnson Mwebaze
Abstract: Unpredictable weather patterns and a lack of timely, accurate information significantly challenge farmers in Uganda, leading to poor crop management, reduced yields, and heightened vulnerability to environmental stress. This research presents a framework for IoT-enabled smart agriculture, leveraging Raspberry Pi-based technology to provide real-time monitoring of weather and environmental conditions. The framework integrates sensors for temperature, rainfall, soil moisture, and pressure, connected via an MCP3208 analog-to-digital converter. Data is displayed on an LCD for immediate feedback and transmitted to the ThingSpeak platform for centralized storage, analysis, and remote access through a mobile app or web interface. Farmers can leverage this framework to optimize irrigation schedules and improve crop productivity through actionable insights derived from real-time and forecasted data on rainfall, temperature, pressure and soil moisture. Additionally, the system incorporates predictive weather forecasting to dynamically control sensor activity, reducing energy consumption and extending sensor lifespan. Simulated using Proteus, the proposed framework demonstrates significant potential to mitigate the impacts of unpredictable weather by reducing water consumption, improving forecasting accuracy, and boosting productivity.

Title: SCDM: Score-Based Channel Denoising Model for Digital Semantic Communications
Authors: Hao Mo, Yaping Sun, Shumin Yao, Hao Chen, Zhiyong Chen, Xiaodong Xu, Meixia Tao, Shuguang Cui
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models represent a significant variant within the diffusion model family and have seen extensive application in the increasingly popular domain of generative tasks. Recent investigations have explored the denoising potential of diffusion models in semantic communications. However, in previous paradigms, noise distortion in the diffusion process does not match precisely with digital channel noise characteristics. In this work, we introduce the Score-Based Channel Denoising Model (SCDM) for Digital Semantic Communications (DSC). SCDM views the distortion of constellation symbol sequences in digital transmission as a score-based forward diffusion process. We design a tailored forward noise corruption to align digital channel noise properties in the training phase. During the inference stage, the well-trained SCDM can effectively denoise received semantic symbols under various SNR conditions, reducing the difficulty for the semantic decoder in extracting semantic information from the received noisy symbols and thereby enhancing the robustness of the reconstructed semantic information. Experimental results show that SCDM outperforms the baseline model in PSNR, SSIM, and MSE metrics, particularly at low SNR levels. Moreover, SCDM reduces storage requirements by a factor of 7.8. This efficiency in storage, combined with its robust denoising capability, makes SCDM a practical solution for DSC across diverse channel conditions.

Title: Performance Analysis of NR Sidelink and Wi-Fi Coexistence Networks in Unlicensed Spectrum
Authors: Zhuangzhuang Yan, Xinyu Gu, Zhenyu Liu
Abstract: With the rapid development of various internet of things (IoT) applications, including industrial IoT (IIoT) and visual IoT (VIoT), the demand for direct device-to-device communication to support high data rates continues to grow. To address this demand, 5G-Advanced has introduced sidelink communication over the unlicensed spectrum (SL-U) as a method to increase data rates. However, the primary challenge of SL-U in the unlicensed spectrum is ensuring fair coexistence with other incumbent systems, such as Wi-Fi. In this paper, we address the challenge by designing channel access mechanisms and power control strategies to mitigate interference and ensure fair coexistence. First, we propose a novel collaborative channel access (CCHA) mechanism that integrates channel access with resource allocation through collaborative interactions between base stations (BS) and SL-U users. This mechanism ensures fair coexistence with incumbent systems while improving resource utilization. Second, we mathematically model the joint channel access and power control problems, analyzing the trade-off between fairness and transmission rate to minimize interference and optimize performance in the coexistence system. Finally, we develop a collaborative subgoal-based hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (C-GHDRL) framework. This framework enables SL-U users to make globally optimal decisions by leveraging collaborative operations between the BS and SL-U users, effectively overcoming the limitations of traditional optimization methods in solving joint optimization problems with nonlinear constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly enhances the coexistence system's performance while ensuring fair coexistence between SL-U and Wi-Fi users.

Title: Assessment of the January 2025 Los Angeles County wildfires: A multi-modal analysis of impact, response, and population exposure
Authors: Seyd Teymoor Seydi
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive analysis of four significant California wildfires: Palisades, Eaton, Kenneth, and Hurst, examining their impacts through multiple dimensions, including land cover change, jurisdictional management, structural damage, and demographic vulnerability. Using the Chebyshev-Kolmogorov-Arnold network model applied to Sentinel-2 imagery, the extent of burned areas was mapped, ranging from 315.36 to 10,960.98 hectares. Our analysis revealed that shrubland ecosystems were consistently the most affected, comprising 57.4-75.8% of burned areas across all events. The jurisdictional assessment demonstrated varying management complexities, from singular authority (98.7% in the Palisades Fire) to distributed management across multiple agencies. A structural impact analysis revealed significant disparities between urban interface fires (Eaton: 9,869 structures; Palisades: 8,436 structures) and rural events (Kenneth: 24 structures; Hurst: 17 structures). The demographic analysis showed consistent gender distributions, with 50.9% of the population identified as female and 49.1% as male. Working-age populations made up the majority of the affected populations, ranging from 53.7% to 54.1%, with notable temporal shifts in post-fire periods. The study identified strong correlations between urban interface proximity, structural damage, and population exposure. The Palisades and Eaton fires affected over 20,000 people each, compared to fewer than 500 in rural events. These findings offer valuable insights for the development of targeted wildfire management strategies, particularly in wildland urban interface zones, and emphasize the need for age- and gender-conscious approaches in emergency response planning.

Title: RayLoc: Wireless Indoor Localization via Fully Differentiable Ray-tracing
Authors: Xueqiang Han, Tianyue Zheng, Tony Xiao Han, Jun Luo
Abstract: Wireless indoor localization has been a pivotal area of research over the last two decades, becoming a cornerstone for numerous sensing applications. However, conventional wireless localization methods rely on channel state information to perform blind modelling and estimation of a limited set of localization parameters. This oversimplification neglects many sensing scene details, resulting in suboptimal localization accuracy. To address this limitation, this paper presents a novel approach to wireless indoor localization by reformulating it as an inverse problem of wireless ray-tracing, inferring scene parameters that generates the measured CSI. At the core of our solution is a fully differentiable ray-tracing simulator that enables backpropagation to comprehensive parameters of the sensing scene, allowing for precise localization. To establish a robust localization context, RayLoc constructs a high-fidelity sensing scene by refining coarse-grained background model. Furthermore, RayLoc overcomes the challenges of sparse gradient and local minima by convolving the signal generation process with a Gaussian kernel. Extensive experiments showcase that RayLoc outperforms traditional localization baselines and is able to generalize to different sensing environments.

Title: Explainable and Robust Millimeter Wave Beam Alignment for AI-Native 6G Networks
Authors: Nasir Khan, Asmaa Abdallah, Abdulkadir Celik, Ahmed M. Eltawil, Sinem Coleri
Abstract: Integrated artificial intelligence (AI) and communication has been recognized as a key pillar of 6G and beyond networks. In line with AI-native 6G vision, explainability and robustness in AI-driven systems are critical for establishing trust and ensuring reliable performance in diverse and evolving environments. This paper addresses these challenges by developing a robust and explainable deep learning (DL)-based beam alignment engine (BAE) for millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The proposed convolutional neural network (CNN)-based BAE utilizes received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements over a set of wide beams to accurately predict the best narrow beam for each UE, significantly reducing the overhead associated with exhaustive codebook-based narrow beam sweeping for initial access (IA) and data transmission. To ensure transparency and resilience, the Deep k-Nearest Neighbors (DkNN) algorithm is employed to assess the internal representations of the network via nearest neighbor approach, providing human-interpretable explanations and confidence metrics for detecting out-of-distribution inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DL-based BAE exhibits robustness to measurement noise, reduces beam training overhead by 75% compared to the exhaustive search while maintaining near-optimal performance in terms of spectral efficiency. Moreover, the proposed framework improves outlier detection robustness by up to 5x and offers clearer insights into beam prediction decisions compared to traditional softmax-based classifiers.

Title: Ranging Performance Analysis in Automotive DToF Lidars
Authors: Xiao Guo
Abstract: In recent years, achieving full autonomy in driving has emerged as a paramount objective for both the industry and academia. Among various perception technologies, Lidar (Light detection and ranging) stands out for its high-precision and high-resolution capabilities based on the principle of light propagation and coupling ranging module and imaging module. Lidar is a sophisticated system that integrates multiple technologies such as optics, mechanics, circuits, and algorithms. Therefore, there are various feasible Lidar schemes to meet the needs of autonomous driving in different scenarios. The ranging performance of Lidar is a key factor that determines the overall performance of autonomous driving systems. As such, it is necessary to conduct a systematic analysis of the ranging performance of different Lidar schemes. In this paper, we present the ranging performance analysis methods corresponding to different optical designs, device selec-tions and measurement mechanisms. By using these methods, we compare the ranging perfor-mance of several typical commercial Lidars. Our findings provide a reference framework for de-signing Lidars with various trade-offs between cost and performance, and offer insights into the advancement towards improving Lidar schemes.

Title: L-Sort: On-chip Spike Sorting with Efficient Median-of-Median Detection and Localization-based Clustering
Authors: Yuntao Han, Yihan Pan, Xiongfei Jiang, Cristian Sestito, Shady Agwa, Themis Prodromakis, Shiwei Wang
Abstract: Spike sorting is a critical process for decoding large-scale neural activity from extracellular recordings. The advancement of neural probes facilitates the recording of a high number of neurons with an increase in channel counts, arising a higher data volume and challenging the current on-chip spike sorters. This paper introduces L-Sort, a novel on-chip spike sorting solution featuring median-of-median spike detection and localization-based clustering. By combining the median-of-median approximation and the proposed incremental median calculation scheme, our detection module achieves a reduction in memory consumption. Moreover, the localization-based clustering utilizes geometric features instead of morphological features, thus eliminating the memory-consuming buffer for containing the spike waveform during feature extraction. Evaluation using Neuropixels datasets demonstrates that L-Sort achieves competitive sorting accuracy with reduced hardware resource consumption. Implementations on FPGA and ASIC (180 nm technology) demonstrate significant improvements in area and power efficiency compared to state-of-the-art designs while maintaining comparable accuracy. If normalized to 22 nm technology, our design can achieve roughly $\times 10$ area and power efficiency with similar accuracy, compared with the state-of-the-art design evaluated with the same dataset. Therefore, L-Sort is a promising solution for real-time, high-channel-count neural processing in implantable devices.

Title: A machine-learning optimized vertical-axis wind turbine
Authors: Huan Liu, Richard D. James
Abstract: Vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) have garnered increasing attention in the field of renewable energy due to their unique advantages over traditional horizontal-axis wind turbines (HAWTs). However, traditional VAWTs including Darrieus and Savonius types suffer from significant drawbacks -- negative torque regions exist during rotation. In this work, we propose a new design of VAWT, which combines design principles from both Darrieus and Savonius but addresses their inherent defects. The performance of the proposed VAWT is evaluated through numerical simulations and validated by experimental testing. The results demonstrate that its power output is approximately three times greater than that of traditional Savonius VAWTs of comparable size. The performance of the proposed VAWT is further optimized using machine learning techniques, including Gaussian process regression and neural networks, based on extensive supercomputer simulations. This optimization leads to a 30% increase in power output.

Title: RadioLLM: Introducing Large Language Model into Cognitive Radio via Hybrid Prompt and Token Reprogrammings
Authors: Shuai Chen, Yong Zu, Zhixi Feng, Shuyuan Yang, Mengchang Li, Yue Ma, Jun Liu, Qiukai Pan, Xinlei Zhang, Changjun Sun
Abstract: The increasing scarcity of spectrum resources and the rapid growth of wireless device have made efficient management of radio networks a critical challenge. Cognitive Radio Technology (CRT), when integrated with deep learning (DL), offers promising solutions for tasks such as radio signal classification (RSC), signal denoising, and spectrum allocation. However, existing DL-based CRT frameworks are often task-specific and lack scalability to diverse real-world scenarios. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities across multiple domains, making them a potential candidate for advancing CRT technologies. In this paper, we introduce RadioLLM, a novel framework that incorporates Hybrid Prompt and Token Reprogramming (HPTR) and a Frequency Attuned Fusion (FAF) module to enhance LLMs for CRT tasks. HPTR enables the integration of radio signal features with expert knowledge, while FAF improves the modeling of high-frequency features critical for precise signal processing. These innovations allow RadioLLM to handle diverse CRT tasks, bridging the gap between LLMs and traditional signal processing methods. Extensive empirical studies on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed RadioLLM achieves superior performance over current baselines.

Title: Statistical Tools for Frequency Response Functions from Posture Control Experiments: Estimation of Probability of a Sample and Comparison Between Groups of Unpaired Samples
Authors: Vittorio Lippi
Abstract: The frequency response function (FRF) is an established way to describe the outcome of experiments in posture control literature. The FRF is an empirical transfer function between an input stimulus and the induced body segment sway profile, represented as a vector of complex values associated with a vector of frequencies. Having obtained an FRF from a trial with a subject, it can be useful to quantify the likelihood it belongs to a certain population, e.g., to diagnose a condition or to evaluate the human likeliness of a humanoid robot or a wearable device. In this work, a recently proposed method for FRF statistics based on confidence bands computed with bootstrap will be summarized, and, on its basis, possible ways to quantify the likelihood of FRFs belonging to a given set will be proposed. Furthermore, a statistical test to compare groups of unpaired samples is presented.

Title: Language Modelling for Speaker Diarization in Telephonic Interviews
Authors: Miquel India, Javier Hernando, José A.R. Fonollosa
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to investigate the benefit of combining both language and acoustic modelling for speaker diarization. Although conventional systems only use acoustic features, in some scenarios linguistic data contain high discriminative speaker information, even more reliable than the acoustic ones. In this study we analyze how an appropriate fusion of both kind of features is able to obtain good results in these cases. The proposed system is based on an iterative algorithm where a LSTM network is used as a speaker classifier. The network is fed with character-level word embeddings and a GMM based acoustic score created with the output labels from previous iterations. The presented algorithm has been evaluated in a Call-Center database, which is composed of telephone interview audios. The combination of acoustic features and linguistic content shows a 84.29% improvement in terms of a word-level DER as compared to a HMM/VB baseline system. The results of this study confirms that linguistic content can be efficiently used for some speaker recognition tasks.

Title: Visualization of Organ Movements Using Automatic Region Segmentation of Swallowing CT
Authors: Yukihiro Michiwaki, Takahiro Kikuchi, Takashi Ijiri, Yoko Inamoto, Hiroshi Moriya, Takumi Ogawa, Ryota Nakatani, Yuto Masaki, Yoshito Otake, Yoshinobu Sato
Abstract: This study presents the first report on the development of an artificial intelligence (AI) for automatic region segmentation of four-dimensional computer tomography (4D-CT) images during swallowing. The material consists of 4D-CT images taken during swallowing. Additionally, data for verifying the practicality of the AI were obtained from 4D-CT images during mastication and swallowing. The ground truth data for the region segmentation for the AI were created from five 4D-CT datasets of swallowing. A 3D convolutional model of nnU-Net was used for the AI. The learning and evaluation method for the AI was leave-one-out cross-validation. The number of epochs for training the nnU-Net was 100. The Dice coefficient was used as a metric to assess the AI's region segmentation accuracy. Regions with a median Dice coefficient of 0.7 or higher included the bolus, bones, tongue, and soft palate. Regions with a Dice coefficient below 0.7 included the thyroid cartilage and epiglottis. Factors that reduced the Dice coefficient included metal artifacts caused by dental crowns in the bolus and the speed of movement for the thyroid cartilage and epiglottis. In practical verification of the AI, no significant misrecognition was observed for facial bones, jaw bones, or the tongue. However, regions such as the hyoid bone, thyroid cartilage, and epiglottis were not fully delineated during fast movement. It is expected that future research will improve the accuracy of the AI's region segmentation, though the risk of misrecognition will always exist. Therefore, the development of tools for efficiently correcting the AI's segmentation results is necessary. AI-based visualization is expected to contribute not only to the deepening of motion analysis of organs during swallowing but also to improving the accuracy of swallowing CT by clearly showing the current state of its precision.

Title: Distilling Knowledge for Designing Computational Imaging Systems
Authors: Leon Suarez-Rodriguez, Roman Jacome, Henry Arguello
Abstract: Designing the physical encoder is crucial for accurate image reconstruction in computational imaging (CI) systems. Currently, these systems are designed via end-to-end (E2E) optimization, where the encoder is modeled as a neural network layer and is jointly optimized with the decoder. However, the performance of E2E optimization is significantly reduced by the physical constraints imposed on the encoder. Also, since the E2E learns the parameters of the encoder by backpropagating the reconstruction error, it does not promote optimal intermediate outputs and suffers from gradient vanishing. To address these limitations, we reinterpret the concept of knowledge distillation (KD) for designing a physically constrained CI system by transferring the knowledge of a pretrained, less-constrained CI system. Our approach involves three steps: (1) Given the original CI system (student), a teacher system is created by relaxing the constraints on the student's encoder. (2) The teacher is optimized to solve a less-constrained version of the student's problem. (3) The teacher guides the training of the student through two proposed knowledge transfer functions, targeting both the encoder and the decoder feature space. The proposed method can be employed to any imaging modality since the relaxation scheme and the loss functions can be adapted according to the physical acquisition and the employed decoder. This approach was validated on three representative CI modalities: magnetic resonance, single-pixel, and compressive spectral imaging. Simulations show that a teacher system with an encoder that has a structure similar to that of the student encoder provides effective guidance. Our approach achieves significantly improved reconstruction performance and encoder design, outperforming both E2E optimization and traditional non-data-driven encoder designs.

Title: Harnessing Wavefront Curvature and Spatial Correlation in Noncoherent MIMO Communications
Authors: Aniol Martí, Luca Sanguinetti, Meritxell Lamarca, Jaume Riba
Abstract: Noncoherent communication systems have regained interest due to the growing demand for high-mobility and low-latency applications. Most existing studies using large antenna arrays rely on the far-field approximation, which assumes locally plane wavefronts. This assumption becomes inaccurate at higher frequencies and shorter ranges, where wavefront curvature plays a significant role and antenna arrays may operate in the radiative near field. In this letter, we adopt a model for the channel spatial correlation matrix that remains valid in both near and far field scenarios. Using this model, we demonstrate that noncoherent systems can leverage the benefits of wavefront spherical curvature, even beyond the Fraunhofer distance, revealing that the classical far-field approximation may significantly underestimate system performance. Moreover, we show that large antenna arrays enable the multiplexing of various users and facilitate near-optimal noncoherent detection with low computational complexity.

Title: Impedance Trajectory Analysis during Power Swing for Grid-Forming Inverter with Different Current Limiters
Authors: Yanshu Niu, Zhe Yang, Bikash C. Pal
Abstract: Grid-forming (GFM) inverter-based resources (IBRs) are capable of emulating the external characteristics of synchronous generators (SGs) through the careful design of the control loops. However, the current limiter in the control loops of the GFM IBR poses challenges to the effectiveness of power swing detection functions designed for SG-based systems. Among various current limiting strategies, current saturation algorithms (CSAs), widely employed for their strict current limiting capability, are the focus of this paper. The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the conditions for entering and exiting the current saturation mode of the GFM IBR under three CSAs. Furthermore, the corresponding impedance trajectories observed by the distance relay on the GFM IBR side are investigated. The analysis results reveal that the unique impedance trajectories under these CSAs markedly differ from those associated with SGs. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the conventional power swing detection scheme may lose functionality due to the rapid movement of the trajectory or its failure to pass through the detection zones. Conclusions are validated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink.

Title: Influence of High-Performance Image-to-Image Translation Networks on Clinical Visual Assessment and Outcome Prediction: Utilizing Ultrasound to MRI Translation in Prostate Cancer
Authors: Mohammad R. Salmanpour, Amin Mousavi, Yixi Xu, William B Weeks, Ilker Hacihaliloglu
Abstract: Purpose: This study examines the core traits of image-to-image translation (I2I) networks, focusing on their effectiveness and adaptability in everyday clinical settings. Methods: We have analyzed data from 794 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa), using ten prominent 2D/3D I2I networks to convert ultrasound (US) images into MRI scans. We also introduced a new analysis of Radiomic features (RF) via the Spearman correlation coefficient to explore whether networks with high performance (SSIM>85%) could detect subtle RFs. Our study further examined synthetic images by 7 invited physicians. As a final evaluation study, we have investigated the improvement that are achieved using the synthetic MRI data on two traditional machine learning and one deep learning method. Results: In quantitative assessment, 2D-Pix2Pix network substantially outperformed the other 7 networks, with an average SSIM~0.855. The RF analysis revealed that 76 out of 186 RFs were identified using the 2D-Pix2Pix algorithm alone, although half of the RFs were lost during the translation process. A detailed qualitative review by 7 medical doctors noted a deficiency in low-level feature recognition in I2I tasks. Furthermore, the study found that synthesized image-based classification outperformed US image-based classification with an average accuracy and AUC~0.93. Conclusion: This study showed that while 2D-Pix2Pix outperformed cutting-edge networks in low-level feature discovery and overall error and similarity metrics, it still requires improvement in low-level feature performance, as highlighted by Group 3. Further, the study found using synthetic image-based classification outperformed original US image-based methods.

Title: Waste Animal Bone-derived Calcium Phosphate Particles with High Solar Reflectance
Authors: Nathaniel LeCompte, Andrew Caratenuto, Yi Zheng
Abstract: Highly reflective Calcium Phosphate (CAP) nanoparticles have been obtained from waste chicken and porcine bones. Chicken and pork bones have been processed and calcined at temperatures between 600°C and 1200°C to remove organic material and resulting in CAP bio-ceramic compounds with high reflectance. The reflectivity of the materials in the solar wavelength region is on par with chemically synthesized CAP. The high reflectivity, consistently over 90%, as well as the size distribution and packing density of the nanoparticles obtained in these early bone studies make a strong case for pursuing this avenue to obtain pigment for high solar reflectivity applications, such as passive daytime radiative cooling. The results presented indicate a viable path toward a cost-effective and eco-friendly source of highly reflective cooling pigments. By sourcing calcium phosphates from animal bones, there is also the potential to divert large quantities of bone waste generated by the meat industry from landfills, further contributing toward sustainability and energy reduction efforts in the construction industry and beyond.

Title: Using Computer Vision for Skin Disease Diagnosis in Bangladesh Enhancing Interpretability and Transparency in Deep Learning Models for Skin Cancer Classification
Authors: Rafiul Islam, Jihad Khan Dipu, Mehedi Hasan Tusar
Abstract: With over 2 million new cases identified annually, skin cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer globally and the second most common in Bangladesh, following breast cancer. Early detection and treatment are crucial for enhancing patient outcomes; however, Bangladesh faces a shortage of dermatologists and qualified medical professionals capable of diagnosing and treating skin cancer. As a result, many cases are diagnosed only at advanced stages. Research indicates that deep learning algorithms can effectively classify skin cancer images. However, these models typically lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand their decision-making processes. This lack of clarity poses barriers to utilizing deep learning in improving skin cancer detection and treatment. In this article, we present a method aimed at enhancing the interpretability of deep learning models for skin cancer classification in Bangladesh. Our technique employs a combination of saliency maps and attention maps to visualize critical features influencing the model's diagnoses.

Title: Estimating Multi-chirp Parameters using Curvature-guided Langevin Monte Carlo
Authors: Sattwik Basu, Debottam Dutta, Yu-Lin Wei, Romit Roy Choudhury
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of estimating chirp parameters from a noisy mixture of chirps. While a rich body of work exists in this area, challenges remain when extending these techniques to chirps of higher order polynomials. We formulate this as a non-convex optimization problem and propose a modified Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) sampler that exploits the average curvature of the objective function to reliably find the minimizer. Results show that our Curvature-guided LMC (CG-LMC) algorithm is robust and succeeds even in low SNR regimes, making it viable for practical applications.

Title: Tunable Multilayer Surface Plasmon Resonance Biosensor for Trace-Level Toxin Detection
Authors: Suripto Bhuiyan, Michael Geller
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study on a novel multilayer surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor designed for detecting trace-level toxins in liquid samples with exceptional precision and efficiency. Leveraging the Kretschmann configuration, the proposed design integrates advanced two-dimensional materials, including black phosphorus (BP) and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), to significantly enhance the performance metrics of the sensor. Key innovations include the optimization of sensitivity through precise material layering, minimization of full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) to improve signal resolution, and maximization of the figure of merit (FoM) for superior detection accuracy. Numerical simulations are employed to validate the structural and functional enhancements of the biosensor. The results demonstrate improved interaction between the evanescent field and the analyte, enabling detection at trace concentrations with higher specificity. This biosensor is poised to contribute to advancements in biochemical sensing, environmental monitoring, and other critical applications requiring high-sensitivity toxin detection.

Title: Ambisonics Binaural Rendering via Masked Magnitude Least Squares
Authors: Or Berebi, Fabian Brinkmann, Stefan Weinzierl, Boaz Rafaely
Abstract: Ambisonics rendering has become an integral part of 3D audio for headphones. It works well with existing recording hardware, the processing cost is mostly independent of the number of sound sources, and it elegantly allows for rotating the scene and listener. One challenge in Ambisonics headphone rendering is to find a perceptually well behaved low-order representation of the Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) that are contained in the rendering pipe-line. Low-order rendering is of interest, when working with microphone arrays containing only a few sensors, or for reducing the bandwidth for signal transmission. Magnitude Least Squares rendering became the de facto standard for this, which discards high-frequency interaural phase information in favor of reducing magnitude errors. Building upon this idea, we suggest Masked Magnitude Least Squares, which optimized the Ambisonics coefficients with a neural network and employs a spatio-spectral weighting mask to control the accuracy of the magnitude reconstruction. In the tested case, the weighting mask helped to maintain high-frequency notches in the low-order HRTFs and improved the modeled median plane localization performance in comparison to MagLS, while only marginally affecting the overall accuracy of the magnitude reconstruction.

Title: BSM-iMagLS: ILD Informed Binaural Signal Matching for Reproduction with Head-Mounted Microphone Arrays
Authors: Or Berebi, Zamir Ben-Hur, David Lou Alon, Boaz Rafaely
Abstract: Headphone listening in applications such as augmented and virtual reality (AR and VR) relies on high-quality spatial audio to ensure immersion, making accurate binaural reproduction a critical component. As capture devices, wearable arrays with only a few microphones with irregular arrangement face challenges in achieving a reproduction quality comparable to that of arrays with a large number of microphones. Binaural signal matching (BSM) has recently been presented as a signal-independent approach for generating high-quality binaural signal using only a few microphones, which is further improved using magnitude-least squares (MagLS) optimization at high frequencies. This paper extends BSM with MagLS by introducing interaural level difference (ILD) into the MagLS, integrated into BSM (BSM-iMagLS). Using a deep neural network (DNN)-based solver, BSM-iMagLS achieves joint optimization of magnitude, ILD, and magnitude derivatives, improving spatial fidelity. Performance is validated through theoretical analysis, numerical simulations with diverse HRTFs and head-mounted array geometries, and listening experiments, demonstrating a substantial reduction in ILD errors while maintaining comparable magnitude accuracy to state-of-the-art solutions. The results highlight the potential of BSM-iMagLS to enhance binaural reproduction for wearable and portable devices.

Title: Signaling Design for Noncoherent Distributed Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems
Authors: Kawon Han, Kaitao Meng, Christos Masouros
Abstract: The ultimate goal of enabling sensing through the cellular network is to obtain coordinated sensing of an unprecedented scale, through distributed integrated sensing and communication (D-ISAC). This, however, introduces challenges related to synchronization and demands new transmission methodologies. In this paper, we propose a transmit signal design framework for D-ISAC systems, where multiple ISAC nodes cooperatively perform sensing and communication without requiring phase-level synchronization. The proposed framework employing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) jointly designs downlink coordinated multi-point (CoMP) communication signals and multi-input multi-output (MIMO) radar signals, leveraging both collocated and distributed MIMO radars to estimate angle-of-arrival (AOA) and time-of-flight (TOF) from all possible multi-static measurements for target localization. To design the optimal D-ISAC transmit signal, we use the target localization Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) as the sensing performance metric and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) as the communication performance metric. Then, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the localization CRB while maintaining a minimum SINR requirement for each communication user. Moreover, we present three distinct transmit signal design approaches, including optimal, orthogonal, and beamforming designs, which reveal trade-offs between ISAC performance and computational complexity. Unlike single-node ISAC systems, the proposed D-ISAC designs involve per-subcarrier sensing signal optimization to enable accurate TOF estimation, which contributes to the target localization performance. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed designs in achieving flexible ISAC trade-offs and efficient D-ISAC signal transmission.

Title: The iToBoS dataset: skin region images extracted from 3D total body photographs for lesion detection
Authors: Anup Saha, Joseph Adeola, Nuria Ferrera, Adam Mothershaw, Gisele Rezze, Séraphin Gaborit, Brian D'Alessandro, James Hudson, Gyula Szabó, Balazs Pataki, Hayat Rajani, Sana Nazari, Hassan Hayat, Clare Primiero, H. Peter Soyer, Josep Malvehy, Rafael Garcia
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has significantly advanced skin cancer diagnosis by enabling rapid and accurate detection of malignant lesions. In this domain, most publicly available image datasets consist of single, isolated skin lesions positioned at the center of the image. While these lesion-centric datasets have been fundamental for developing diagnostic algorithms, they lack the context of the surrounding skin, which is critical for improving lesion detection. The iToBoS dataset was created to address this challenge. It includes 16,954 images of skin regions from 100 participants, captured using 3D total body photography. Each image roughly corresponds to a $7 \times 9$ cm section of skin with all suspicious lesions annotated using bounding boxes. Additionally, the dataset provides metadata such as anatomical location, age group, and sun damage score for each image. This dataset aims to facilitate training and benchmarking of algorithms, with the goal of enabling early detection of skin cancer and deployment of this technology in non-clinical environments.

Title: Time Frequency Localized Pulse for Delay Doppler Domain Data Transmission
Authors: Sanoopkumar P. S, Muyiwa Balogun, Liam Barry, Arman Farhang
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) is a strong candidate waveform for sixth generation wireless communication networks (6G), which can effectively handle time varying wireless channels. In this paper, we analyze the effect of fractional delay in delay Doppler (DD) domain multiplexing techniques. We develop a vector-matrix input-output relationship for the DD domain data transmission system by incorporating the effective pulse shaping filter between the transmitter and receiver along with the channel. Using this input-output relationship, we analyze the effect of the pulse shaping filter on the channel estimation and BER performance in the presence of fractional delay and uncompensated fractional timing offset (TO). For the first time, we propose the use of time-frequency localized (TFL) pulse shaping for the OTFS waveform to overcome the interference due to fractional delays. We show that our proposed TFL-OTFS outperforms the widely used raised cosine pulse-shaped OTFS (RC-OTFS) in the presence of fractional delays. Additionally, TFL-OTFS also shows very high robustness against uncompensated fractional TO, compared to RC-OTFS.

Title: Estimating unknown dynamics and cost as a bilinear system with Koopman-based Inverse Optimal Control
Authors: Victor Nan Fernandez-Ayala, Shankar A. Deka, Dimos V. Dimarogonas
Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of approximating unknown system dynamics and costs by representing them as a bilinear system using Koopman-based Inverse Optimal Control (IOC). Using optimal trajectories, we construct a bilinear control system in transformed state variables through a modified Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (EDMDc) that maintains exact dynamical equivalence with the original nonlinear system. We derive Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP) optimality conditions for this system, which closely resemble those of the inverse Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem due to the consistent control input and state independence from the control. This similarity allows us to apply modified inverse LQR theory, offering a more tractable and robust alternative to nonlinear Inverse Optimal Control methods, especially when dealing with unknown dynamics. Our approach also benefits from the extensive analytical properties of bilinear control systems, providing a solid foundation for further analysis and application. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through theoretical analysis, simulation studies and a robotic experiment, highlighting its potential for broader applications in the approximation and design of control systems.

Title: Joint Power and Spectrum Orchestration for D2D Semantic Communication Underlying Energy-Efficient Cellular Networks
Authors: Le Xia, Yao Sun, Haijian Sun, Rose Qingyang Hu, Dusit Niyato, Muhammad Ali Imran
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has been recently deemed a promising next-generation wireless technique to enable efficient spectrum savings and information exchanges, thus naturally introducing a novel and practical network paradigm where cellular and device-to-device (D2D) SemCom approaches coexist. Nevertheless, the involved wireless resource management becomes complicated and challenging due to the unique semantic performance measurements and energy-consuming semantic coding mechanism. To this end, this paper jointly investigates power control and spectrum reuse problems for energy-efficient D2D SemCom cellular networks. Concretely, we first model the user preference-aware semantic triplet transmission and leverage a novel metric of semantic value to identify the semantic information importance conveyed in SemCom. Then, we define the additional power consumption from semantic encoding in conjunction with basic power amplifier dissipation to derive the overall system energy efficiency (semantics/Joule). Next, we formulate an energy efficiency maximization problem for joint power and spectrum allocation subject to several SemCom-related and practical constraints. Afterward, we propose an optimal resource management solution by employing the fractional-to-subtractive problem transformation and decomposition while developing a three-stage method with theoretical analysis of its optimality guarantee and computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate the adequate performance superiority of our proposed solution compared with different benchmarks.

Title: Multilayered Intelligent Reflecting Surface for Long-Range Underwater Acoustic Communication
Authors: Yu Luo, Lina Pu, Aijun Song
Abstract: This article introduces a multilayered acoustic reconfigurable intelligent surface (ML-ARIS) architecture designed for the next generation of underwater communications. ML-ARIS incorporates multiple layers of piezoelectric material in each acoustic reflector, with the load impedance of each layer independently adjustable via a control circuit. This design increases the flexibility in generating reflected signals with desired amplitudes and orthogonal phases, enabling passive in-phase and quadrature (IQ) modulation using a single acoustic reflector. Such a feature enables precise beam steering, enhancing sound levels in targeted directions while minimizing interference in surrounding environments. Extensive simulations and tank experiments were conducted to verify the feasibility of ML-ARIS. The experimental results indicate that implementing IQ modulation with a multilayer structure is indeed practical in real-world scenarios, making it possible to use a single reflection unit to generate reflected waves with high-resolution amplitudes and phases.

Title: A Hybrid Dynamic Subarray Architecture for Efficient DOA Estimation in THz Ultra-Massive Hybrid MIMO Systems
Authors: Ye Tian, Jiaji Ren, Tuo Wu, Wei Liu, Chau Yuen, Merouane Debbah, Naofal Al-Dhahir, Matthew C. Valenti, Hing Cheung So, Yonina C. Eldar
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communication combined with ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) technology is promising for 6G wireless systems, where fast and precise direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation is crucial for effective beamforming. However, finding DOAs in THz UM-MIMO systems faces significant challenges: while reducing hardware complexity, the hybrid analog-digital (HAD) architecture introduces inherent difficulties in spatial information acquisition the large-scale antenna array causes significant deviations in eigenvalue decomposition results; and conventional two-dimensional DOA estimation methods incur prohibitively high computational overhead, hindering fast and accurate realization. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid dynamic subarray (HDS) architecture that strategically divides antenna elements into subarrays, ensuring phase differences between subarrays correlate exclusively with single-dimensional DOAs. Leveraging this architectural innovation, we develop two efficient algorithms for DOA estimation: a reduced-dimension MUSIC (RD-MUSIC) algorithm that enables fast processing by correcting large-scale array estimation bias, and an improved version that further accelerates estimation by exploiting THz channel sparsity to obtain initial closed-form solutions through specialized two-RF-chain configuration. Furthermore, we develop a theoretical framework through Cramér-Rao lower bound analysis, providing fundamental insights for different HDS configurations. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our solution achieves both superior estimation accuracy and computational efficiency, making it particularly suitable for practical THz UM-MIMO systems.

Title: Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers for the Multi-User MIMO Uplink
Authors: Tierui Gong, Chau Yuen, Chong Meng Samson See, Mérouane Debbah, Lajos Hanzo
Abstract: Rydberg atomic quantum receivers exhibit great potential in assisting classical wireless communications due to their outstanding advantages in detecting radio frequency signals. To realize this potential, we integrate a Rydberg atomic quantum receiver into a classical multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) scheme to form a multi-user Rydberg atomic quantum MIMO (RAQ-MIMO) system for the uplink. To study this system, we first construct an equivalent baseband signal model, which facilitates convenient system design, signal processing and optimizations. We then study the ergodic achievable rates under both the maximum ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) schemes by deriving their tight lower bounds. We next compare the ergodic achievable rates of the RAQ-MIMO and the conventional massive MIMO schemes by offering a closed-form expression for the difference of their ergodic achievable rates, which allows us to directly compare the two systems. Our results show that RAQ-MIMO allows the average transmit power of users to be $\sim 20$ dBm lower than that of the conventional massive MIMO. Viewed from a different perspective, an extra $\sim 7$ bits/s/Hz/user rate becomes achievable by ZF RAQ-MIMO, when equipping $50 \sim 500$ receive elements for receiving $1 \sim 100$ user signals at an enough transmit power (e.g., $\ge 20$ dBm).

Title: Pinching Antenna Systems (PASS): Architecture Designs, Opportunities, and Outlook
Authors: Yuanwei Liu, Zhaolin Wang, Xidong Mu, Chongjun Ouyang, Xiaoxia Xu, Zhiguo Ding
Abstract: This article proposes a novel design for the Pinching Antenna Systems (PASS) and advocates simple yet efficient wireless communications over the `last meter'. First, the potential benefits of PASS are discussed by reviewing an existing prototype. Then, the fundamentals of PASS are introduced, including physical principles, signal models, and communication designs. In contrast to existing multi-antenna systems, PASS brings a novel concept termed \emph{Pinching Beamforming}, which is achieved by dynamically adjusting the positions of PAs. Based on this concept, a couple of practical transmission architectures are proposed for employing PASS, namely non-multiplexing and multiplexing architectures. More particularly, 1) The non-multiplexing architecture is featured by simple baseband signal processing and relies only on the pinching beamforming; while 2) the multiplexing architecture provides enhanced signal manipulation capabilities with joint baseband and pinching beamforming, which is further divided into sub-connected, fully-connected, and phase-shifter-based fully-connected schemes. Furthermore, several emerging scenarios are put forward for integrating PASS into future wireless networks. As a further advance, by demonstrating a few numerical case studies, the significant performance gain of PASS is revealed compared to conventional multi-antenna systems. Finally, several research opportunities and open problems of PASS are highlighted.

Title: Real Time Scheduling Framework for Multi Object Detection via Spiking Neural Networks
Authors: Donghwa Kang, Woojin Shin, Cheol-Ho Hong, Minsuk Koo, Brent ByungHoon Kang, Jinkyu Lee, Hyeongboo Baek
Abstract: Given the energy constraints in autonomous mobile agents (AMAs), such as unmanned vehicles, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are increasingly favored as a more efficient alternative to traditional artificial neural networks. AMAs employ multi-object detection (MOD) from multiple cameras to identify nearby objects while ensuring two essential objectives, (R1) timing guarantee and (R2) high accuracy for safety. In this paper, we propose RT-SNN, the first system design, aiming at achieving R1 and R2 in SNN-based MOD systems on AMAs. Leveraging the characteristic that SNNs gather feature data of input image termed as membrane potential, through iterative computation over multiple timesteps, RT-SNN provides multiple execution options with adjustable timesteps and a novel method for reusing membrane potential to support R1. Then, it captures how these execution strategies influence R2 by introducing a novel notion of mean absolute error and membrane confidence. Further, RT-SNN develops a new scheduling framework consisting of offline schedulability analysis for R1 and a run-time scheduling algorithm for R2 using the notion of membrane confidence. We deployed RT-SNN to Spiking-YOLO, the SNN-based MOD model derived from ANN-to-SNN conversion, and our experimental evaluation confirms its effectiveness in meeting the R1 and R2 requirements while providing significant energy efficiency.

Title: Task-based Regularization in Penalized Least-Squares for Binary Signal Detection Tasks in Medical Image Denoising
Authors: Wentao Chen, Tianming Xu, Weimin Zhou
Abstract: Image denoising algorithms have been extensively investigated for medical imaging. To perform image denoising, penalized least-squares (PLS) problems can be designed and solved, in which the penalty term encodes prior knowledge of the object being imaged. Sparsity-promoting penalties, such as total variation (TV), have been a popular choice for regularizing image denoising problems. However, such hand-crafted penalties may not be able to preserve task-relevant information in measured image data and can lead to oversmoothed image appearances and patchy artifacts that degrade signal detectability. Supervised learning methods that employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as a popular approach to denoising medical images. However, studies have shown that CNNs trained with loss functions based on traditional image quality measures can lead to a loss of task-relevant information in images. Some previous works have investigated task-based loss functions that employ model observers for training the CNN denoising models. However, such training processes typically require a large number of noisy and ground-truth (noise-free or low-noise) image data pairs. In this work, we propose a task-based regularization strategy for use with PLS in medical image denoising. The proposed task-based regularization is associated with the likelihood of linear test statistics of noisy images for Gaussian noise models. The proposed method does not require ground-truth image data and solves an individual optimization problem for denoising each image. Computer-simulation studies are conducted that consider a multivariate-normally distributed (MVN) lumpy background and a binary texture background. It is demonstrated that the proposed regularization strategy can effectively improve signal detectability in denoised images.

Title: Resampling Filter Design for Multirate Neural Audio Effect Processing
Authors: Alistair Carson, Vesa Välimäki, Alec Wright, Stefan Bilbao
Abstract: Neural networks have become ubiquitous in audio effects modelling, especially for guitar amplifiers and distortion pedals. One limitation of such models is that the sample rate of the training data is implicitly encoded in the model weights and therefore not readily adjustable at inference. Recent work explored modifications to recurrent neural network architecture to approximate a sample rate independent system, enabling audio processing at a rate that differs from the original training rate. This method works well for integer oversampling and can reduce aliasing caused by nonlinear activation functions. For small fractional changes in sample rate, fractional delay filters can be used to approximate sample rate independence, but in some cases this method fails entirely. Here, we explore the use of signal resampling at the input and output of the neural network as an alternative solution. We investigate several resampling filter designs and show that a two-stage design consisting of a half-band IIR filter cascaded with a Kaiser window FIR filter can give similar or better results to the previously proposed model adjustment method with many fewer operations per sample and less than one millisecond of latency at typical audio rates. Furthermore, we investigate interpolation and decimation filters for the task of integer oversampling and show that cascaded half-band IIR and FIR designs can be used in conjunction with the model adjustment method to reduce aliasing in a range of distortion effect models.

Title: Automating Physics-Based Reasoning for SysML Model Validation
Authors: Candice Chambers, Summer Mueller, Parth Ganeriwala, Chiradeep Sen, Siddhartha Bhattacharyya
Abstract: System and software design benefits greatly from formal modeling, allowing for automated analysis and verification early in the design phase. Current methods excel at checking information flow and component interactions, ensuring consistency, and identifying dependencies within Systems Modeling Language (SysML) models. However, these approaches often lack the capability to perform physics-based reasoning about a system's behavior represented in SysML models, particularly in the electromechanical domain. This significant gap critically hinders the ability to automatically and effectively verify the correctness and consistency of the model's behavior against well-established underlying physical principles. Therefore, this paper presents an approach that leverages existing research on function representation, including formal languages, graphical representations, and reasoning algorithms, and integrates them with physics-based verification techniques. Four case studies (coffeemaker, vacuum cleaner, hairdryer, and wired speaker) are inspected to illustrate the model's practicality and effectiveness in performing physics-based reasoning on systems modeled in SysML. This automated physics-based reasoning is broken into two main categories: (i) structural, which is performed on BDD and IBD, and (ii) functional, which is then performed on activity diagrams. This work advances the field of automated reasoning by providing a framework for verifying structural and functional correctness and consistency with physical laws within SysML models.

Title: Low-Thrust Many-Revolution Trajectory Design Under Operational Uncertainties for DESTINY+ Mission
Authors: Naoya Ozaki, Yuki Akiyama, Akira Hatakeyama, Shota Ito, Takuya Chikazawa, Takayuki Yamamoto
Abstract: DESTINY+ is a planned JAXA medium-class Epsilon mission from Earth to deep space using a low-thrust, many-revolution orbit. Such a trajectory design is a challenging problem not only for trajectory design but also for flight operations, and in particular, it is essential to evaluate the impact of operational uncertainties to ensure mission success. In this study, we design the low-thrust trajectory from Earth orbit to a lunar transfer orbit by differential dynamic programming using the Sundman transformation. The results of Monte Carlo simulations with operational uncertainties confirm that the spacecraft can be successfully guided to the lunar transfer orbit by using the feedback control law of differential dynamic programming in the angular domain.

Title: Task and Perception-aware Distributed Source Coding for Correlated Speech under Bandwidth-constrained Channels
Authors: Sagnik Bhattacharya, Muhammad Ahmed Mohsin, Ahsan Bilal, John M. Cioffi
Abstract: Emerging wireless AR/VR applications require real-time transmission of correlated high-fidelity speech from multiple resource-constrained devices over unreliable, bandwidth-limited channels. Existing autoencoder-based speech source coding methods fail to address the combination of the following - (1) dynamic bitrate adaptation without retraining the model, (2) leveraging correlations among multiple speech sources, and (3) balancing downstream task loss with realism of reconstructed speech. We propose a neural distributed principal component analysis (NDPCA)-aided distributed source coding algorithm for correlated speech sources transmitting to a central receiver. Our method includes a perception-aware downstream task loss function that balances perceptual realism with task-specific performance. Experiments show significant PSNR improvements under bandwidth constraints over naive autoencoder methods in task-agnostic (19%) and task-aware settings (52%). It also approaches the theoretical upper bound, where all correlated sources are sent to a single encoder, especially in low-bandwidth scenarios. Additionally, we present a rate-distortion-perception trade-off curve, enabling adaptive decisions based on application-specific realism needs.

Title: VidSole: A Multimodal Dataset for Joint Kinetics Quantification and Disease Detection with Deep Learning
Authors: Archit Kambhamettu, Samantha Snyder, Maliheh Fakhar, Samuel Audia, Ross Miller, Jae Kun Shim, Aniket Bera
Abstract: Understanding internal joint loading is critical for diagnosing gait-related diseases such as knee osteoarthritis; however, current methods of measuring joint risk factors are time-consuming, expensive, and restricted to lab settings. In this paper, we enable the large-scale, cost-effective biomechanical analysis of joint loading via three key contributions: the development and deployment of novel instrumented insoles, the creation of a large multimodal biomechanics dataset (VidSole), and a baseline deep learning pipeline to predict internal joint loading factors. Our novel instrumented insole measures the tri-axial forces and moments across five high-pressure points under the foot. VidSole consists of the forces and moments measured by these insoles along with corresponding RGB video from two viewpoints, 3D body motion capture, and force plate data for over 2,600 trials of 52 diverse participants performing four fundamental activities of daily living (sit-to-stand, stand-to-sit, walking, and running). We feed the insole data and kinematic parameters extractable from video (i.e., pose, knee angle) into a deep learning pipeline consisting of an ensemble Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) activity classifier followed by activity-specific Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) regression networks to estimate knee adduction moment (KAM), a biomechanical risk factor for knee osteoarthritis. The successful classification of activities at an accuracy of 99.02 percent and KAM estimation with mean absolute error (MAE) less than 0.5 percent*body weight*height, the current threshold for accurately detecting knee osteoarthritis with KAM, illustrates the usefulness of our dataset for future research and clinical settings.

Title: ProcTex: Consistent and Interactive Text-to-texture Synthesis for Procedural Models
Authors: Ruiqi Xu, Zihan Zhu, Xianghao Xu, Srinath Sridhar, Daniel Ritchie
Abstract: Recent advancement in 2D image diffusion models has driven significant progress in text-guided texture synthesis, enabling realistic, high-quality texture generation from arbitrary text prompts. However, current methods usually focus on synthesizing texture for single static 3D objects, and struggle to handle entire families of shapes, such as those produced by procedural programs. Applying existing methods naively to each procedural shape is too slow to support exploring different parameter settings at interactive rates, and also results in inconsistent textures across the procedural shapes. To this end, we introduce ProcTex, the first text-to-texture system designed for procedural 3D models. ProcTex enables consistent and real-time text-guided texture synthesis for families of shapes, which integrates seamlessly with the interactive design flow of procedural models. To ensure consistency, our core approach is to generate texture for the shape produced by one setting of the procedural parameters, followed by a texture transfer stage to apply the texture to other parameter settings. We also develop several techniques, including a novel UV displacement network for real-time texture transfer, the retexturing pipeline to support structural changes from discrete procedural parameters, and part-level UV texture map generation for local appearance editing. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of professional procedural models validate ProcTex's ability to produce high-quality, visually consistent textures while supporting real-time, interactive applications.

Title: Unsupervised Patch-GAN with Targeted Patch Ranking for Fine-Grained Novelty Detection in Medical Imaging
Authors: Jingkun Chen, Guang Yang, Xiao Zhang, Jingchao Peng, Tianlu Zhang, Jianguo Zhang, Jungong Han, Vicente Grau
Abstract: Detecting novel anomalies in medical imaging is challenging due to the limited availability of labeled data for rare abnormalities, which often display high variability and subtlety. This challenge is further compounded when small abnormal regions are embedded within larger normal areas, as whole-image predictions frequently overlook these subtle deviations. To address these issues, we propose an unsupervised Patch-GAN framework designed to detect and localize anomalies by capturing both local detail and global structure. Our framework first reconstructs masked images to learn fine-grained, normal-specific features, allowing for enhanced sensitivity to minor deviations from normality. By dividing these reconstructed images into patches and assessing the authenticity of each patch, our approach identifies anomalies at a more granular level, overcoming the limitations of whole-image evaluation. Additionally, a patch-ranking mechanism prioritizes regions with higher abnormal scores, reinforcing the alignment between local patch discrepancies and the global image context. Experimental results on the ISIC 2016 skin lesion and BraTS 2019 brain tumor datasets validate our framework's effectiveness, achieving AUCs of 95.79% and 96.05%, respectively, and outperforming three state-of-the-art baselines.

Title: Agricultural Industry Initiatives on Autonomy: How collaborative initiatives of VDMA and AEF can facilitate complexity in domain crossing harmonization needs
Authors: Georg Happich, Alexander Grever, Julius Schöning
Abstract: The agricultural industry is undergoing a significant transformation with the increasing adoption of autonomous technologies. Addressing complex challenges related to safety and security, components and validation procedures, and liability distribution is essential to facilitate the adoption of autonomous technologies. This paper explores the collaborative groups and initiatives undertaken to address these challenges. These groups investigate inter alia three focal topics: 1) describe the functional architecture of the operational range, 2) define the work context, i.e., the realistic scenarios that emerge in various agricultural applications, and 3) the static and dynamic detection cases that need to be detected by sensor sets. Linked by the Agricultural Operational Design Domain (Agri-ODD), use case descriptions, risk analysis, and questions of liability can be handled. By providing an overview of these collaborative initiatives, this paper aims to highlight the joint development of autonomous agricultural systems that enhance the overall efficiency of farming operations.

Title: TransRAD: Retentive Vision Transformer for Enhanced Radar Object Detection
Authors: Lei Cheng, Siyang Cao
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in environment perception capabilities for autonomous driving and intelligent robotics, cameras and LiDARs remain notoriously unreliable in low-light conditions and adverse weather, which limits their effectiveness. Radar serves as a reliable and low-cost sensor that can effectively complement these limitations. However, radar-based object detection has been underexplored due to the inherent weaknesses of radar data, such as low resolution, high noise, and lack of visual information. In this paper, we present TransRAD, a novel 3D radar object detection model designed to address these challenges by leveraging the Retentive Vision Transformer (RMT) to more effectively learn features from information-dense radar Range-Azimuth-Doppler (RAD) data. Our approach leverages the Retentive Manhattan Self-Attention (MaSA) mechanism provided by RMT to incorporate explicit spatial priors, thereby enabling more accurate alignment with the spatial saliency characteristics of radar targets in RAD data and achieving precise 3D radar detection across Range-Azimuth-Doppler dimensions. Furthermore, we propose Location-Aware NMS to effectively mitigate the common issue of duplicate bounding boxes in deep radar object detection. The experimental results demonstrate that TransRAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both 2D and 3D radar detection tasks, achieving higher accuracy, faster inference speed, and reduced computational complexity.

Title: Digital Twin-Enabled Real-Time Control in Robotic Additive Manufacturing via Soft Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Matsive Ali, Sandesh Giri, Sen Liu, Qin Yang
Abstract: Smart manufacturing systems increasingly rely on adaptive control mechanisms to optimize complex processes. This research presents a novel approach integrating Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning with digital twin technology to enable real-time process control in robotic additive manufacturing. We demonstrate our methodology using a Viper X300s robot arm, implementing two distinct control scenarios: static target acquisition and dynamic trajectory following.

Title: Online Nonstochastic Control with Convex Safety Constraints
Authors: Nanfei Jiang, Spencer Hutchinson, Mahnoosh Alizadeh
Abstract: This paper considers the online nonstochastic control problem of a linear time-invariant system under convex state and input constraints that need to be satisfied at all times. We propose an algorithm called Online Gradient Descent with Buffer Zone for Convex Constraints (OGD-BZC), designed to handle scenarios where the system operates within general convex safety constraints. We demonstrate that OGD-BZC, with appropriate parameter selection, satisfies all the safety constraints under bounded adversarial disturbances. Additionally, to evaluate the performance of OGD-BZC, we define the regret with respect to the best safe linear policy in hindsight. We prove that OGD-BZC achieves $\tilde{O} (\sqrt{T})$ regret given proper parameter choices. Our numerical results highlight the efficacy and robustness of the proposed algorithm.

Title: Power-Efficient Over-the-Air Aggregation with Receive Beamforming for Federated Learning
Authors: Faeze Moradi Kalarde, Min Dong, Ben Liang, Yahia A. Eldemerdash Ahmed, Ho Ting Cheng
Abstract: This paper studies power-efficient uplink transmission design for federated learning (FL) that employs over-the-air analog aggregation and multi-antenna beamforming at the server. We jointly optimize device transmit weights and receive beamforming at each FL communication round to minimize the total device transmit power while ensuring convergence in FL training. Through our convergence analysis, we establish sufficient conditions on the aggregation error to guarantee FL training convergence. Utilizing these conditions, we reformulate the power minimization problem into a unique bi-convex structure that contains a transmit beamforming optimization subproblem and a receive beamforming feasibility subproblem. Despite this unconventional structure, we propose a novel alternating optimization approach that guarantees monotonic decrease of the objective value, to allow convergence to a partial optimum. We further consider imperfect channel state information (CSI), which requires accounting for the channel estimation errors in the power minimization problem and FL convergence analysis. We propose a CSI-error-aware joint beamforming algorithm, which can substantially outperform one that does not account for channel estimation errors. Simulation with canonical classification datasets demonstrates that our proposed methods achieve significant power reduction compared to existing benchmarks across a wide range of parameter settings, while attaining the same target accuracy under the same convergence rate.

Title: DIAL: Distribution-Informed Adaptive Learning of Multi-Task Constraints for Safety-Critical Systems
Authors: Se-Wook Yoo, Seung-Woo Seo
Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning has traditionally relied on predefined constraint functions to ensure safety in complex real-world tasks, such as autonomous driving. However, defining these functions accurately for varied tasks is a persistent challenge. Recent research highlights the potential of leveraging pre-acquired task-agnostic knowledge to enhance both safety and sample efficiency in related tasks. Building on this insight, we propose a novel method to learn shared constraint distributions across multiple tasks. Our approach identifies the shared constraints through imitation learning and then adapts to new tasks by adjusting risk levels within these learned distributions. This adaptability addresses variations in risk sensitivity stemming from expert-specific biases, ensuring consistent adherence to general safety principles even with imperfect demonstrations. Our method can be applied to control and navigation domains, including multi-task and meta-task scenarios, accommodating constraints such as maintaining safe distances or adhering to speed limits. Experimental results validate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating superior safety performance and success rates compared to baselines, all without requiring task-specific constraint definitions. These findings underscore the versatility and practicality of our method across a wide range of real-world tasks.

Title: Battery State of Health Estimation Using LLM Framework
Authors: Aybars Yunusoglu, Dexter Le, Karn Tiwari, Murat Isik, I. Can Dikmen
Abstract: Battery health monitoring is critical for the efficient and reliable operation of electric vehicles (EVs). This study introduces a transformer-based framework for estimating the State of Health (SoH) and predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of lithium titanate (LTO) battery cells by utilizing both cycle-based and instantaneous discharge data. Testing on eight LTO cells under various cycling conditions over 500 cycles, we demonstrate the impact of charge durations on energy storage trends and apply Differential Voltage Analysis (DVA) to monitor capacity changes (dQ/dV) across voltage ranges. Our LLM model achieves superior performance, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as low as 0.87\% and varied latency metrics that support efficient processing, demonstrating its strong potential for real-time integration into EVs. The framework effectively identifies early signs of degradation through anomaly detection in high-resolution data, facilitating predictive maintenance to prevent sudden battery failures and enhance energy efficiency.

Title: Efficient Audiovisual Speech Processing via MUTUD: Multimodal Training and Unimodal Deployment
Authors: Joanna Hong, Sanjeel Parekh, Honglie Chen, Jacob Donley, Ke Tan, Buye Xu, Anurag Kumar
Abstract: Building reliable speech systems often requires combining multiple modalities, like audio and visual cues. While such multimodal solutions frequently lead to improvements in performance and may even be critical in certain cases, they come with several constraints such as increased sensory requirements, computational cost, and modality synchronization, to mention a few. These challenges constrain the direct uses of these multimodal solutions in real-world applications. In this work, we develop approaches where the learning happens with all available modalities but the deployment or inference is done with just one or reduced modalities. To do so, we propose a Multimodal Training and Unimodal Deployment (MUTUD) framework which includes a Temporally Aligned Modality feature Estimation (TAME) module that can estimate information from missing modality using modalities present during inference. This innovative approach facilitates the integration of information across different modalities, enhancing the overall inference process by leveraging the strengths of each modality to compensate for the absence of certain modalities during inference. We apply MUTUD to various audiovisual speech tasks and show that it can reduce the performance gap between the multimodal and corresponding unimodal models to a considerable extent. MUTUD can achieve this while reducing the model size and compute compared to multimodal models, in some cases by almost 80%.

Title: Advancing Personalized Federated Learning: Integrative Approaches with AI for Enhanced Privacy and Customization
Authors: Kevin Cooper, Michael Geller
Abstract: In the age of data-driven decision making, preserving privacy while providing personalized experiences has become paramount. Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) offers a promising framework by decentralizing the learning process, thus ensuring data privacy and reducing reliance on centralized data repositories. However, the integration of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques within PFL remains underexplored. This paper proposes a novel approach that enhances PFL with cutting-edge AI methodologies including adaptive optimization, transfer learning, and differential privacy. We present a model that not only boosts the performance of individual client models but also ensures robust privacy-preserving mechanisms and efficient resource utilization across heterogeneous networks. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements in model accuracy and personalization, along with stringent privacy adherence, as compared to conventional federated learning models. This work paves the way for a new era of truly personalized and privacy-conscious AI systems, offering significant implications for industries requiring compliance with stringent data protection regulations.

Title: Machine Learning Fairness for Depression Detection using EEG Data
Authors: Angus Man Ho Kwok, Jiaee Cheong, Sinan Kalkan, Hatice Gunes
Abstract: This paper presents the very first attempt to evaluate machine learning fairness for depression detection using electroencephalogram (EEG) data. We conduct experiments using different deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks across three EEG datasets: Mumtaz, MODMA and Rest. We employ five different bias mitigation strategies at the pre-, in- and post-processing stages and evaluate their effectiveness. Our experimental results show that bias exists in existing EEG datasets and algorithms for depression detection, and different bias mitigation methods address bias at different levels across different fairness measures.

Title: Neural Operator based Reinforcement Learning for Control of first-order PDEs with Spatially-Varying State Delay
Authors: Jiaqi Hu, Jie Qi, Jing Zhang
Abstract: Control of distributed parameter systems affected by delays is a challenging task, particularly when the delays depend on spatial variables. The idea of integrating analytical control theory with learning-based control within a unified control scheme is becoming increasingly promising and advantageous. In this paper, we address the problem of controlling an unstable first-order hyperbolic PDE with spatially-varying delays by combining PDE backstepping control strategies and deep reinforcement learning (RL). To eliminate the assumption on the delay function required for the backstepping design, we propose a soft actor-critic (SAC) architecture incorporating a DeepONet to approximate the backstepping controller. The DeepONet extracts features from the backstepping controller and feeds them into the policy network. In simulations, our algorithm outperforms the baseline SAC without prior backstepping knowledge and the analytical controller.

Title: Joint Design and Pricing of Extended Warranties for Multiple Automobiles with Different Price Bands
Authors: Yajing Chen, Yanrong Li, Xiao-Lin Wang, Zhi-Sheng Ye
Abstract: Extended warranties (EWs) are significant source of revenue for capital-intensive products like automobiles. Such products consist of multiple subsystems, providing flexibility in EW customization, for example, bundling a tailored set of subsystems in an EW contract. This, in turn, enables the creation of a service menu with different EW contract options. From the perspective of a third-party EW provider servicing a fleet of automobile brands, we develop a novel model to jointly optimize the design and pricing of EWs in order to maximize the profit. Specifically, the problem is to determine which contracts should be included in the EW menu and identify the appropriate price for each contract. As the complexity of the joint optimization problem increases exponentially with the number of subsystems, two solution approaches are devised to solve the problem. The first approach is based on a mixed-integer second-order cone programming reformulation, which guarantees optimality but is applicable only for a small number of subsystems. The second approach utilizes a two-step iteration process, offering enhanced computational efficiency in scenarios with a large number of subsystems. Through numerical experiments, the effectiveness of our model is validated, particularly in scenarios characterized by high failure rates and a large number of subsystems.

Authors: Xudong Li, Matthias Frey, Ehsan Tohidi, Igor Bjelaković, Sławomir Stańczak
Abstract: We propose a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted wiretap channel, where the RIS is strategically deployed to provide a spatial separation to the transmitter, and orthogonal combiners are employed at the legitimate receiver to extract the data streams from the direct and RIS-assisted links. Then we derive the achievable secrecy rate under semantic security for the RIS-assisted channel and design an algorithm for the secrecy rate optimization problem. The simulation results show the effects of total transmit power, the location and number of eavesdroppers on the security performance.

Title: Dynamic Model Fine-Tuning For Extreme MIMO CSI Compression
Authors: Mehdi Sattari, Deniz Gündüz, Tommmy Svensson
Abstract: Efficient channel state information (CSI) compression is crucial in frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems due to excessive feedback overhead. Recently, deep learning-based compression techniques have demonstrated superior performance across various data types, including CSI. However, these approaches often experience performance degradation when the data distribution changes due to their limited generalization capabilities. To address this challenge, we propose a model fine-tuning approach for CSI feedback in massive MIMO systems. The idea is to fine-tune the encoder/decoder network models in a dynamic fashion using the recent CSI samples. First, we explore encoder-only fine-tuning, where only the encoder parameters are updated, leaving the decoder and latent parameters unchanged. Next, we consider full-model fine-tuning, where the encoder and decoder models are jointly updated. Unlike encoder-only fine-tuning, full-model fine-tuning requires the updated decoder and latent parameters to be transmitted to the decoder side. To efficiently handle this, we propose different prior distributions for model updates, such as uniform and truncated Gaussian to entropy code them together with the compressed CSI and account for additional feedback overhead imposed by conveying the model updates. Moreover, we incorporate quantized model updates during fine-tuning to reflect the impact of quantization in the deployment phase. Our results demonstrate that full-model fine-tuning significantly enhances the rate-distortion (RD) performance of neural CSI compression. Furthermore, we analyze how often the full-model fine-tuning should be applied in a new wireless environment and identify an optimal period interval for achieving the best RD trade-off.

Title: AGAV-Rater: Adapting Large Multimodal Model for AI-Generated Audio-Visual Quality Assessment
Authors: Yuqin Cao, Xiongkuo Min, Yixuan Gao, Wei Sun, Guangtao Zhai
Abstract: Many video-to-audio (VTA) methods have been proposed for dubbing silent AI-generated videos. An efficient quality assessment method for AI-generated audio-visual content (AGAV) is crucial for ensuring audio-visual quality. Existing audio-visual quality assessment methods struggle with unique distortions in AGAVs, such as unrealistic and inconsistent elements. To address this, we introduce AGAVQA, the first large-scale AGAV quality assessment dataset, comprising 3,382 AGAVs from 16 VTA methods. AGAVQA includes two subsets: AGAVQA-MOS, which provides multi-dimensional scores for audio quality, content consistency, and overall quality, and AGAVQA-Pair, designed for optimal AGAV pair selection. We further propose AGAV-Rater, a LMM-based model that can score AGAVs, as well as audio and music generated from text, across multiple dimensions, and selects the best AGAV generated by VTA methods to present to the user. AGAV-Rater achieves state-of-the-art performance on AGAVQA, Text-to-Audio, and Text-to-Music datasets. Subjective tests also confirm that AGAV-Rater enhances VTA performance and user experience.

Title: Leveraging LLM Agents for Automated Optimization Modeling for SASP Problems: A Graph-RAG based Approach
Authors: Tianpeng Pan, Wenqiang Pu, Licheng Zhao, Rui Zhou
Abstract: Automated optimization modeling (AOM) has evoked considerable interest with the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches predominantly rely on prompt engineering, utilizing meticulously designed expert response chains or structured guidance. However, prompt-based techniques have failed to perform well in the sensor array signal processing (SASP) area due the lack of specific domain knowledge. To address this issue, we propose an automated modeling approach based on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique, which consists of two principal components: a multi-agent (MA) structure and a graph-based RAG (Graph-RAG) process. The MA structure is tailored for the architectural AOM process, with each agent being designed based on principles of human modeling procedure. The Graph-RAG process serves to match user query with specific SASP modeling knowledge, thereby enhancing the modeling result. Results on ten classical signal processing problems demonstrate that the proposed approach (termed as MAG-RAG) outperforms several AOM benchmarks.

Title: Waveform-Specific Performance of Deep Learning-Based Super-Resolution for Ultrasound Contrast Imaging
Authors: Rienk Zorgdrager, Nathan Blanken, Jelmer M. Wolterink, Michel Versluis, Guillaume Lajoinie
Abstract: Resolving arterial flows is essential for understanding cardiovascular pathologies, improving diagnosis, and monitoring patient condition. Ultrasound contrast imaging uses microbubbles to enhance the scattering of the blood pool, allowing for real-time visualization of blood flow. Recent developments in vector flow imaging further expand the imaging capabilities of ultrasound by temporally resolving fast arterial flow. The next obstacle to overcome is the lack of spatial resolution. Super-resolved ultrasound images can be obtained by deconvolving radiofrequency (RF) signals before beamforming, breaking the link between resolution and pulse duration. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be trained to locally estimate the deconvolution kernel and consequently super-localize the microbubbles directly within the RF signal. However, microbubble contrast is highly nonlinear, and the potential of CNNs in microbubble localization has not yet been fully exploited. Assessing deep learning-based deconvolution performance for non-trivial imaging pulses is therefore essential for successful translation to a practical setting, where the signal-to-noise ratio is limited, and transmission schemes should comply with safety guidelines. In this study, we train CNNs to deconvolve RF signals and localize the microbubbles driven by harmonic pulses, chirps, or delay-encoded pulse trains. Furthermore, we discuss potential hurdles for in-vitro and in-vivo super-resolution by presenting preliminary experimental results. We find that, whereas the CNNs can accurately localize microbubbles for all pulses, a short imaging pulse offers the best performance in noise-free conditions. However, chirps offer a comparable performance without noise, but are more robust to noise and outperform all other pulses in low-signal-to-noise ratio conditions.

Title: Cracks in concrete
Authors: Tin Barisin, Christian Jung, Anna Nowacka, Claudia Redenbach, Katja Schladitz
Abstract: Finding and properly segmenting cracks in images of concrete is a challenging task. Cracks are thin and rough and being air filled do yield a very weak contrast in 3D images obtained by computed tomography. Enhancing and segmenting dark lower-dimensional structures is already demanding. The heterogeneous concrete matrix and the size of the images further increase the complexity. ML methods have proven to solve difficult segmentation problems when trained on enough and well annotated data. However, so far, there is not much 3D image data of cracks available at all, let alone annotated. Interactive annotation is error-prone as humans can easily tell cats from dogs or roads without from roads with cars but have a hard time deciding whether a thin and dark structure seen in a 2D slice continues in the next one. Training networks by synthetic, simulated images is an elegant way out, bears however its own challenges. In this contribution, we describe how to generate semi-synthetic image data to train CNN like the well known 3D U-Net or random forests for segmenting cracks in 3D images of concrete. The thickness of real cracks varies widely, both, within one crack as well as from crack to crack in the same sample. The segmentation method should therefore be invariant with respect to scale changes. We introduce the so-called RieszNet, designed for exactly this purpose. Finally, we discuss how to generalize the ML crack segmentation methods to other concrete types.

Title: Performance guarantees for optimization-based state estimation using turnpike properties
Authors: Julian D. Schiller, Lars Grüne, and Matthias A. Müller
Abstract: In this paper, we develop novel accuracy and performance guarantees for optimal state estimation of general nonlinear systems (in particular, moving horizon estimation, MHE). Our results rely on a turnpike property of the optimal state estimation problem, which essentially states that the omniscient infinite-horizon solution involving all past and future data serves as turnpike for the solutions of finite-horizon estimation problems involving a subset of the data. This leads to the surprising observation that MHE problems naturally exhibit a leaving arc, which may have a strong negative impact on the estimation accuracy. To address this, we propose a delayed MHE scheme, and we show that the resulting performance (both averaged and non-averaged) is approximately optimal and achieves bounded dynamic regret with respect to the infinite-horizon solution, with error terms that can be made arbitrarily small by an appropriate choice of the delay. In various simulation examples, we observe that already a very small delay in the MHE scheme is sufficient to significantly improve the overall estimation error by 20-25 % compared to standard MHE (without delay). This finding is of great importance for practical applications (especially for monitoring, fault detection, and parameter estimation) where a small delay in the estimation is rather irrelevant but may significantly improve the estimation results.

Title: Transfer Learning for Keypoint Detection in Low-Resolution Thermal TUG Test Images
Authors: Wei-Lun Chen, Chia-Yeh Hsieh, Yu-Hsiang Kao, Kai-Chun Liu, Sheng-Yu Peng, Yu Tsao
Abstract: This study presents a novel approach to human keypoint detection in low-resolution thermal images using transfer learning techniques. We introduce the first application of the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test in thermal image computer vision, establishing a new paradigm for mobility assessment. Our method leverages a MobileNetV3-Small encoder and a ViTPose decoder, trained using a composite loss function that balances latent representation alignment and heatmap accuracy. The model was evaluated using the Object Keypoint Similarity (OKS) metric from the COCO Keypoint Detection Challenge. The proposed model achieves better performance with AP, AP50, and AP75 scores of 0.861, 0.942, and 0.887 respectively, outperforming traditional supervised learning approaches like Mask R-CNN and ViTPose-Base. Moreover, our model demonstrates superior computational efficiency in terms of parameter count and FLOPS. This research lays a solid foundation for future clinical applications of thermal imaging in mobility assessment and rehabilitation monitoring.

Title: HSRMamba: Contextual Spatial-Spectral State Space Model for Single Hyperspectral Super-Resolution
Authors: Shi Chen, Lefei Zhang, Liangpei Zhang
Abstract: Mamba has demonstrated exceptional performance in visual tasks due to its powerful global modeling capabilities and linear computational complexity, offering considerable potential in hyperspectral image super-resolution (HSISR). However, in HSISR, Mamba faces challenges as transforming images into 1D sequences neglects the spatial-spectral structural relationships between locally adjacent pixels, and its performance is highly sensitive to input order, which affects the restoration of both spatial and spectral details. In this paper, we propose HSRMamba, a contextual spatial-spectral modeling state space model for HSISR, to address these issues both locally and globally. Specifically, a local spatial-spectral partitioning mechanism is designed to establish patch-wise causal relationships among adjacent pixels in 3D features, mitigating the local forgetting issue. Furthermore, a global spectral reordering strategy based on spectral similarity is employed to enhance the causal representation of similar pixels across both spatial and spectral dimensions. Finally, experimental results demonstrate our HSRMamba outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in quantitative quality and visual results. Code will be available soon.

Title: Optimum Monitoring and Job Assignment with Multiple Markov Machines
Authors: Sahan Liyanaarachchi, Sennur Ulukus
Abstract: We study a class of systems termed Markov Machines (MM) which process job requests with exponential service times. Assuming a Poison job arrival process, these MMs oscillate between two states, free and busy. We consider the problem of sampling the states of these MMs so as to track their states, subject to a total sampling budget, with the goal of allocating external job requests effectively to them. For this purpose, we leverage the $\textit{binary freshness metric}$ to quantify the quality of our ability to track the states of the MMs, and introduce two new metrics termed $\textit{false acceptance ratio}$ (FAR) and $\textit{false rejection ratio}$ (FRR) to evaluate the effectiveness of our job assignment strategy. We provide optimal sampling rate allocation schemes for jointly monitoring a system of $N$ heterogeneous MMs.

Title: Reducing Simulation Effort for RIS Optimization using an Efficient Far-Field Approximation
Authors: Hans-Dieter Lang, Michel A. Nyffenegger, Heinz Mathis, Xingqi Zhang
Abstract: Optimization of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) via a previously introduced method is effective, but time-consuming, because multiport impedance or scatter matrices are required for each transmitter and receiver position, which generally must be obtained through full-wave simulation. Herein, a simple and efficient far-field approximation is introduced, to extrapolate scatter matrices for arbitrary receiver and transmitter positions from only a single simulation while still maintaining high accuracy suitable for optimization purposes. This is demonstrated through comparisons of the optimized capacitance values and further supported by empirical measurements.

Title: An RRAM-Based Implementation of a Template Matching Circuit for Low-Power Analogue Classification
Authors: Patrick Foster, Georgios Papandroulidakis, Alex Serb, Spyros Stathopoulos Themis Prodromakis
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning and neuro-inspired systems enabled the increased interest in efficient pattern recognition at the edge. A wide variety of applications, such as near-sensor classification, require fast and low-power approaches for pattern matching through the use of associative memories and their more well-known implementation, Content Addressable Memories (CAMs). Towards addressing the need for low-power classification, this work showcases an RRAM-based analogue CAM (ACAM) intended for template matching applications, providing a low-power reconfigurable classification engine for the extreme edge. The circuit uses a low component count at 6T2R2M, comparable with the most compact existing cells of this type. In this work, we demonstrate a hardware prototype, built with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components for the MOSFET-based circuits, that implements rows of 6T2R2M employing TiOx-based RRAM devices developed in-house, showcasing competitive matching window configurability and definition. Furthermore, through simulations, we validate the performance of the proposed circuit by using a commercially available 180nm technology and in-house RRAM data-driven model to assess the energy dissipation, exhibiting 60 pJ per classification event.

Title: Robust Fuel-Optimal Landing Guidance for Hazardous Terrain using Multiple Sliding Surfaces
Authors: Sheikh Zeeshan Basar, Satadal Ghosh
Abstract: In any spacecraft landing mission, fuel-efficient precision soft landing while avoiding nearby hazardous terrain is of utmost importance. Very few existing literature have attempted addressing both the problems of precision soft landing and terrain avoidance simultaneously. To this end, an optimal terrain avoidance landing guidance (OTALG) was recently developed, which showed promising performance in avoiding the terrain while consuming near-minimum fuel. However, its performance significantly degrades in the face of external disturbances, indicating lack of robustness. To mitigate this problem, in this paper, a near fuel-optimal guidance law is developed to avoid terrain and achieve precision soft landing at the desired landing site. Expanding the OTALG formulation using sliding mode control with multiple sliding surfaces (MSS), the presented guidance law, named `MSS-OTALG', improves precision soft landing accuracy. Further, the sliding parameter is designed to allow the lander to avoid terrain by leaving the trajectory enforced by the sliding mode and eventually returning to it when the terrain avoidance phase is completed. And finally, the robustness of the MSS-OTALG is established by proving practical fixed-time stability. Extensive numerical simulations are also presented to showcase its performance in terms of terrain avoidance, low fuel consumption, and accuracy of precision soft landing under bounded atmospheric perturbations, thrust deviations, and constraints. Comparative studies against existing relevant literature validate a balanced trade-off of all these performance measures achieved by the developed MSS-OTALG.

Title: Quantifying uncertainty in lung cancer segmentation with foundation models applied to mixed-domain datasets
Authors: Aneesh Rangnekar, Nishant Nadkarni, Jue Jiang, Harini Veeraraghavan
Abstract: Medical image foundation models have shown the ability to segment organs and tumors with minimal fine-tuning. These models are typically evaluated on task-specific in-distribution (ID) datasets. However, reliable performance on ID datasets does not guarantee robust generalization on out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Importantly, once deployed for clinical use, it is impractical to have `ground truth' delineations to assess ongoing performance drifts, especially when images fall into the OOD category due to different imaging protocols. Hence, we introduced a comprehensive set of computationally fast metrics to evaluate the performance of multiple foundation models (Swin UNETR, SimMIM, iBOT, SMIT) trained with self-supervised learning (SSL). All models were fine-tuned on identical datasets for lung tumor segmentation from computed tomography (CT) scans. The evaluation was performed on two public lung cancer datasets (LRAD: n = 140, 5Rater: n = 21) with different image acquisitions and tumor stages compared to training data (n = 317 public resource with stage III-IV lung cancers) and a public non-cancer dataset containing volumetric CT scans of patients with pulmonary embolism (n = 120). All models produced similarly accurate tumor segmentation on the lung cancer testing datasets. SMIT produced the highest F1-score (LRAD: 0.60, 5Rater: 0.64) and lowest entropy (LRAD: 0.06, 5Rater: 0.12), indicating higher tumor detection rate and confident segmentations. In the OOD dataset, SMIT misdetected the least number of tumors, marked by a median volume occupancy of 5.67 cc compared to the best method SimMIM of 9.97 cc. Our analysis shows that additional metrics such as entropy and volume occupancy may help better understand model performance on mixed domain datasets.

Title: PV-S3: Advancing Automatic Photovoltaic Defect Detection using Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation of Electroluminescence Images
Authors: Abhishek Jha, Yogesh Rawat, Shruti Vyas
Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) systems allow us to tap into all abundant solar energy, however they require regular maintenance for high efficiency and to prevent degradation. Traditional manual health check, using Electroluminescence (EL) imaging, is expensive and logistically challenging which makes automated defect detection essential. Current automation approaches require extensive manual expert labeling, which is time-consuming, expensive, and prone to errors. We propose PV-S3 (Photovoltaic-Semi Supervised Segmentation), a Semi-Supervised Learning approach for semantic segmentation of defects in EL images that reduces reliance on extensive labeling. PV-S3 is a Deep learning model trained using a few labeled images along with numerous unlabeled images. We introduce a novel Semi Cross-Entropy loss function to deal with class imbalance. We evaluate PV-S3 on multiple datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness and adaptability. With merely 20% labeled samples, we achieve an absolute improvement of 9.7% in IoU, 13.5% in Precision, 29.15% in Recall, and 20.42% in F1-Score over prior state-of-the-art supervised method (which uses 100% labeled samples) on UCF-EL dataset (largest dataset available for semantic segmentation of EL images) showing improvement in performance while reducing the annotation costs by 80%.

Title: A general framework for supporting economic feasibility of generator and storage energy systems through capacity and dispatch optimization
Authors: Saeed Azad, Ziraddin Gulumjanli, Daniel R. Herber
Abstract: Integration of various electricity-generating technologies (such as natural gas, wind, nuclear, etc.) with storage systems (such as thermal, battery electric, hydrogen, etc.) has the potential to improve the economic competitiveness of modern energy systems. Driven by the need to efficiently assess the economic feasibility of various energy system configurations in early system concept development, this work outlines a versatile computational framework for assessing the net present value of various integrated storage technologies. The subsystems' fundamental dynamics are defined, with a particular emphasis on balancing critical physical and economic domains to enable optimal decision-making in the context of capacity and dispatch optimization. In its presented form, the framework formulates a linear, convex optimization problem that can be efficiently solved using a direct transcription approach in the open-source software DTQP. Three case studies demonstrate and validate the framework's capabilities, highlighting its value and computational efficiency in facilitating the economic assessment of various energy system configurations. In particular, natural gas with thermal storage and carbon capture, wind energy with battery storage, and nuclear with hydrogen are demonstrated.

Title: Data-Driven Min-Max MPC for Linear Systems: Robustness and Adaptation
Authors: Yifan Xie, Julian Berberich, Frank Allgöwer
Abstract: Data-driven controllers design is an important research problem, in particular when data is corrupted by the noise. In this paper, we propose a data-driven min-max model predictive control (MPC) scheme using noisy input-state data for unknown linear time-invariant (LTI) system. The unknown system matrices are characterized by a set-membership representation using the noisy input-state data. Leveraging this representation, we derive an upper bound on the worst-case cost and determine the corresponding optimal state-feedback control law through a semidefinite program (SDP). We prove that the resulting closed-loop system is robustly stabilized and satisfies the input and state constraints. Further, we propose an adaptive data-driven min-max MPC scheme which exploits additional online input-state data to improve closed-loop performance. Numerical examples show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Title: Swin transformers are robust to distribution and concept drift in endoscopy-based longitudinal rectal cancer assessment
Authors: Jorge Tapias Gomez, Aneesh Rangnekar, Hannah Williams, Hannah Thompson, Julio Garcia-Aguilar, Joshua Jesse Smith, Harini Veeraraghavan
Abstract: Endoscopic images are used at various stages of rectal cancer treatment starting from cancer screening, diagnosis, during treatment to assess response and toxicity from treatments such as colitis, and at follow up to detect new tumor or local regrowth (LR). However, subjective assessment is highly variable and can underestimate the degree of response in some patients, subjecting them to unnecessary surgery, or overestimate response that places patients at risk of disease spread. Advances in deep learning has shown the ability to produce consistent and objective response assessment for endoscopic images. However, methods for detecting cancers, regrowth, and monitoring response during the entire course of patient treatment and follow-up are lacking. This is because, automated diagnosis and rectal cancer response assessment requires methods that are robust to inherent imaging illumination variations and confounding conditions (blood, scope, blurring) present in endoscopy images as well as changes to the normal lumen and tumor during treatment. Hence, a hierarchical shifted window (Swin) transformer was trained to distinguish rectal cancer from normal lumen using endoscopy images. Swin as well as two convolutional (ResNet-50, WideResNet-50), and vision transformer (ViT) models were trained and evaluated on follow-up longitudinal images to detect LR on private dataset as well as on out-of-distribution (OOD) public colonoscopy datasets to detect pre/non-cancerous polyps. Color shifts were applied using optimal transport to simulate distribution shifts. Swin and ResNet models were similarly accurate in the in-distribution dataset. Swin was more accurate than other methods (follow-up: 0.84, OOD: 0.83) even when subject to color shifts (follow-up: 0.83, OOD: 0.87), indicating capability to provide robust performance for longitudinal cancer assessment.

Abstract: End-to-end engineering design pipelines, in which designs are evaluated using concurrently defined optimal controllers, are becoming increasingly common in practice. To discover designs that perform well even under the misspecification of system dynamics, such end-to-end pipelines have now begun evaluating designs with a robust control objective in place of the nominal optimal control setup. Current approaches of specifying such robust control subproblems, however, rely on hand specification of perturbations anticipated to be present upon deployment or margin methods that ignore problem structure, resulting in a lack of theoretical guarantees and overly conservative empirical performance. We, instead, propose a novel methodology for LQR systems that leverages conformal prediction to specify such uncertainty regions in a data-driven fashion. Such regions have distribution-free coverage guarantees on the true system dynamics, in turn allowing for a probabilistic characterization of the regret of the resulting robust controller. We then demonstrate that such a controller can be efficiently produced via a novel policy gradient method that has convergence guarantees. We finally demonstrate the superior empirical performance of our method over alternate robust control specifications, such as $H_{\infty}$ and LQR with multiplicative noise, across a collection of engineering control systems.

Title: Deep Koopman Learning using the Noisy Data
Authors: Wenjian Hao, Devesh Upadhyay, Shaoshuai Mou
Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven framework to learn a finite-dimensional approximation of a Koopman operator for approximating the state evolution of a dynamical system under noisy observations. To this end, our proposed solution has two main advantages. First, the proposed method only requires the measurement noise to be bounded. Second, the proposed method modifies the existing deep Koopman operator formulations by characterizing the effect of the measurement noise on the Koopman operator learning and then mitigating it by updating the tunable parameter of the observable functions of the Koopman operator, making it easy to implement. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on several standard benchmarks. We then compare the presented method with similar methods proposed in the latest literature on Koopman learning.

Title: Leader-Follower Density Control of Spatial Dynamics in Large-Scale Multi-Agent Systems
Authors: Gian Carlo Maffettone, Alain Boldini, Maurizio Porfiri, Mario di Bernardo
Abstract: We address the problem of controlling the density of a large ensemble of follower agents by acting on a group of leader agents that interact with them. Using coupled partial integro-differential equations to describe leader and follower density dynamics, we establish feasibility conditions and develop two control architectures ensuring global stability. The first employs feed-forward control on the followers' and a leaders' density feedback. The second implements a dual feedback loop through a reference-governor that adapts the leaders' density based on both populations measurements. Our methods, initially developed in a one-dimensional setting, are extended to multi-dimensional cases, and validated through numerical simulations for representative control applications, both for groups of infinite and finite size.

Title: Beyond Near-Field: Far-Field Location Division Multiple Access in Downlink MIMO Systems
Authors: Haoyan Liu, Caijian Jie, Min Yang, Chengguang Li
Abstract: Exploring channel dimensions has been the driving force behind breakthroughs in successive generations of mobile communication systems. In 5G, space division multiple access (SDMA) leveraging massive MIMO has been crucial in enhancing system capacity through spatial differentiation of users. However, SDMA can only finely distinguish users at adjacent angles in ultra-dense networks by extremely large-scale antenna arrays. For a long time, most research has focused on the angle domain of the space, overlooking the potential of the distance domain. Near-field location division multiple access (LDMA) was proposed based on the beam-focusing effect yielded by near-field spherical propagation model, partitioning channel resources by both angle and distance. To achieve a similar idea in the far-field region, this paper introduces a far-field LDMA scheme for wideband systems based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Benefiting from frequency diverse arrays (FDA), it becomes possible to manipulate beams in the distance domain. Combined with OFDM, the inherent cyclic prefix ensures a complete OFDM symbol can be received without losing distance information, while the matched filter of OFDM helps eliminate the time-variance of FDA steering vectors. Theoretical and simulation results show that LDMA can fully exploit the additional degrees of freedom in the distance domain to significantly improve spectral efficiency, especially in narrow sector multiple access (MA) scenarios. Moreover, LDMA can maintain independence between array elements even in single-path channels, making it stand out in MA schemes at millimeter-wave and higher frequency bands.

Title: Predictive control for nonlinear stochastic systems: Closed-loop guarantees with unbounded noise
Authors: Johannes Köhler, Melanie N. Zeilinger
Abstract: We present a stochastic model predictive control framework for nonlinear systems subject to unbounded process noise with closed-loop guarantees. First, we provide a conceptual shrinking-horizon framework that utilizes general probabilistic reachable sets and minimizes the expected cost. Then, we provide a tractable receding-horizon formulation that uses a nominal state to minimize a deterministic quadratic cost and satisfy tightened constraints. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates recursive feasibility, satisfaction of chance constraints, and bounds on the expected cost for the resulting closed-loop system. We provide a constructive design for probabilistic reachable sets of nonlinear continuously differentiable systems using stochastic contraction metrics. Numerical simulations highlight the computational efficiency and theoretical guarantees of the proposed method. Overall, this paper provides a framework for computationally tractable stochastic predictive control with closed-loop guarantees for nonlinear systems with unbounded noise.

Title: Perspectives: Comparison of Deep Learning Segmentation Models on Biophysical and Biomedical Data
Authors: J Shepard Bryan IV, Pedro Pessoa, Meyam Tavakoli, Steve Presse
Abstract: Deep learning based approaches are now widely used across biophysics to help automate a variety of tasks including image segmentation, feature selection, and deconvolution. However, the presence of multiple competing deep learning architectures, each with its own unique advantages and disadvantages, makes it challenging to select an architecture best suited for a specific application. As such, we present a comprehensive comparison of common models. Here, we focus on the task of segmentation assuming the typically small training dataset sizes available from biophysics experiments and compare the following four commonly used architectures: convolutional neural networks, U-Nets, vision transformers, and vision state space models. In doing so, we establish criteria for determining optimal conditions under which each model excels, thereby offering practical guidelines for researchers and practitioners in the field.

Title: Interpolation Filter Design for Sample Rate Independent Audio Effect RNNs
Authors: Alistair Carson, Alec Wright, Stefan Bilbao
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are effective at emulating the non-linear, stateful behavior of analog guitar amplifiers and distortion effects. Unlike the case of direct circuit simulation, RNNs have a fixed sample rate encoded in their model weights, making the sample rate non-adjustable during inference. Recent work has proposed increasing the sample rate of RNNs at inference (oversampling) by increasing the feedback delay length in samples, using a fractional delay filter for non-integer conversions. Here, we investigate the task of lowering the sample rate at inference (undersampling), and propose using an extrapolation filter to approximate the required fractional signal advance. We consider two filter design methods and analyse the impact of filter order on audio quality. Our results show that the correct choice of filter can give high quality results for both oversampling and undersampling; however, in some cases the sample rate adjustment leads to unwanted artefacts in the output signal. We analyse these failure cases through linearised stability analysis, showing that they result from instability around a fixed point. This approach enables an informed prediction of suitable interpolation filters for a given RNN model before runtime.

Title: ROK Defense M&S in the Age of Hyperscale AI: Concepts, Challenges, and Future Directions
Authors: Youngjoon Lee, Taehyun Park, Yeongjoon Kang, Jonghoe Kim, Joonhyuk Kang
Abstract: Integrating hyperscale AI into national defense M&S(Modeling and Simulation), under the expanding IoMDT(Internet of Military Defense Things) framework, is crucial for boosting strategic and operational readiness. We examine how IoMDT-driven hyperscale AI can provide high accuracy, speed, and the ability to simulate complex, interconnected battlefield scenarios in defense M&S. Countries like the United States and China are leading the adoption of these technologies, with varying levels of success. However, realizing the full potential of hyperscale AI requires overcoming challenges such as closed networks, sparse or long-tail data, complex decision-making processes, and a shortage of experts. Future directions highlight the need to adopt domestic foundation models, expand GPU/NPU investments, leverage large tech services, and employ open source solutions. These efforts will enhance national security, maintain a competitive edge, and spur broader technological and economic growth. With this blueprint, the Republic of Korea can strengthen its defense posture and stay ahead of emerging threats in modern warfare.

Title: A 9T4R RRAM-Based ACAM for Analogue Template Matching at the Edge
Authors: Georgios Papandroulidakis, Shady Agwa, Ahmet Cirakoglu, Themis Prodromakis
Abstract: The continuous shift of computational bottlenecks to the memory access and data transfer, especially for AI applications, poses the urgent needs of re-engineering the computer architecture fundamentals. Many edge computing applications, like wearable and implantable medical devices, introduce increasingly more challenges to conventional computing systems due to the strict requirements of area and power at the edge. Emerging technologies, like Resistive RAM (RRAM), have shown a promising momentum in developing neuro-inspired analogue computing paradigms capable of achieving high classification capabilities alongside high energy efficiency. In this work, we present a novel RRAM-based Analogue Content Addressable Memory (ACAM) for on-line analogue template matching applications. This ACAM-based template matching architecture aims to achieve energy-efficient classification where low energy is of utmost importance. We are showcasing a highly tuneable novel RRAM-based ACAM pixel implemented using a commercial 180nm CMOS technology and in-house RRAM technology and exhibiting low energy dissipation of approximately 0.036pJ and 0.16pJ for mismatch and match, respectively, at 66MHz with 3V voltage supply. A proof-of-concept system-level implementation based on this novel pixel design is also implemented in 180nm.

Title: Fundamental Trade-offs in Quantized Hybrid Radar Fusion: A CRB-Rate Perspective
Authors: Akhileswar Chowdary, Ahmad Bazzi, Roberto Bomfin, Marwa Chafii
Abstract: While recent advancements have highlighted the role of low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, the specific impact of ADC resolution on hybrid radar fusion (HRF), where we fuse monostatic and bistatic sensing systems remains relatively unexplored. The uplink (UL) paths in HRF, comprising both direct and reflected signals within the same frequency band, pose unique challenges, particularly given that the reflected signal is often significantly weaker than the direct path, making HRF systems susceptible to ADC resolution. To investigate the influence of quantization and ADC resolution on HRF, we employ the quantized Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) as a metric for sensing accuracy. This work derives the quantized CRB specifically for HRF systems and the quantized communication rate. We extend our analysis to obtain lower bounds on the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) and UL communication rate, which we use to characterize quantized HRF systems. Using these derived bounds, we analyze the quantized HRF system through the lens of CRB-rate boundaries. We obtain the CRB-rate boundary through two optimization problems, where each solution point represents a trade-off boundary between the sensing accuracy and the communication rate. Extensive simulations illustrate the influence of ADC resolution, dynamic range (DR), and various system parameters on the CRB-rate boundary of HRF systems. These results offer critical insights into the design of efficient and high-performance HRF systems.

Title: Digital Twin-Assisted Space-Air-Ground Integrated Multi-Access Edge Computing for Low-Altitude Economy: An Online Decentralized Optimization Approach
Authors: Long He, Geng Sun, Zemin Sun, Jiacheng Wang, Hongyang Du, Dusit Niyato, Jiangchuan Liu, Victor C. M. Leung
Abstract: The emergence of space-air-ground integrated multi-access edge computing (SAGIMEC) networks opens a significant opportunity for the rapidly growing low altitude economy (LAE), facilitating the development of various applications by offering efficient communication and computing services. However, the heterogeneous nature of SAGIMEC networks, coupled with the stringent computational and communication requirements of diverse applications in the LAE, introduces considerable challenges in integrating SAGIMEC into the LAE. In this work, we first present a digital twin-assisted SAGIMEC paradigm for LAE, where digital twin enables reliable network monitoring and management, while SAGIMEC provides efficient computing offloading services for Internet of Things sensor devices (ISDs). Then, a joint satellite selection, computation offloading, communication resource allocation, computation resource allocation and UAV trajectory control optimization problem (JSC4OP) is formulated to maximize the quality of service (QoS) of ISDs. Given the complexity of JSC4OP, we propose an online decentralized optimization approach (ODOA) to address the problem. Specifically, JSC4OP is first transformed into a real-time decision-making optimization problem (RDOP) by leveraging Lyapunov optimization. Then, to solve the RDOP, we introduce an online learning-based latency prediction method to predict the uncertain system environment and a game theoretic decision-making method to make real-time decisions. Finally, theoretical analysis confirms the effectiveness of the ODOA, while the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ODOA outperforms other alternative approaches in terms of overall system performance.

Title: Physics-based battery model parametrisation from impedance data
Authors: Noël Hallemans, Nicola E. Courtier, Colin P. Please, Brady Planden, Rishit Dhoot, Robert Timms, S. Jon chapman, David Howey, Stephen R. Duncan
Abstract: Non-invasive parametrisation of physics-based battery models can be performed by fitting the model to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data containing features related to the different physical processes. However, this requires an impedance model to be derived, which may be complex to obtain analytically. We have developed the open-source software PyBaMM-EIS that provides a fast method to compute the impedance of any PyBaMM model at any operating point using automatic differentiation. Using PyBaMM-EIS, we investigate the impedance of the single particle model, single particle model with electrolyte (SPMe), and Doyle-Fuller-Newman model, and identify the SPMe as a parsimonious option that shows the typical features of measured lithium-ion cell impedance data. We provide a grouped parameter SPMe and analyse the features in the impedance related to each parameter. Using the open-source software PyBOP, we estimate 18 grouped parameters both from simulated impedance data and from measured impedance data from a LG M50LT lithium-ion battery. The parameters that directly affect the response of the SPMe can be accurately determined and assigned to the correct electrode. Crucially, parameter fitting must be done simultaneously to data across a wide range of states-of-charge. Overall, this work presents a practical way to find the parameters of physics-based models.

Title: Learning-Augmented Online Control for Decarbonizing Water Infrastructures
Authors: Jianyi Yang, Pengfei Li, Tongxin Li, Adam Wierman, Shaolei Ren
Abstract: Water infrastructures are essential for drinking water supply, irrigation, fire protection, and other critical applications. However, water pumping systems, which are key to transporting water to the point of use, consume significant amounts of energy and emit millions of tons of greenhouse gases annually. With the wide deployment of digital water meters and sensors in these infrastructures, Machine Learning (ML) has the potential to optimize water supply control and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, the inherent vulnerability of ML methods in terms of worst-case performance raises safety concerns when deployed in critical water infrastructures. To address this challenge, we propose a learning-augmented online control algorithm, termed LAOC, designed to dynamically schedule the activation and/or speed of water pumps. To ensure safety, we introduce a novel design of safe action sets for online control problems. By leveraging these safe action sets, LAOC can provably guarantee safety constraints while utilizing ML predictions to reduce energy and environmental costs. Our analysis reveals the tradeoff between safety requirements and average energy/environmental cost performance. Additionally, we conduct an experimental study on a building water supply system to demonstrate the empirical performance of LAOC. The results indicate that LAOC can effectively reduce environmental and energy costs while guaranteeing safety constraints.

Title: Kalman filter/deep-learning hybrid automatic boundary tracking of optical coherence tomography data for deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK)
Authors: Hongrui Yi, Jinglun Yu, Yaning Wang, Justin Opfermann, Bill G. Gensheimer, Axel Kriger, Jin U. Kang
Abstract: Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) is a highly challenging partial thickness cornea transplant surgery that replaces the anterior cornea above Descemet's membrane (DM) with a donor cornea. In our previous work, we proposed the design of an optical coherence tomography (OCT) sensor integrated needle to acquire real-time M-mode images to provide depth feedback during OCT-guided needle insertion during Big Bubble DALK procedures. Machine learning and deep learning techniques were applied to M-mode images to automatically identify the DM in OCT M-scan data. However, such segmentation methods often produce inconsistent or jagged segmentation of the DM which reduces the model accuracy. Here we present a Kalman filter based OCT M-scan boundary tracking algorithm in addition to AI-based precise needle guidance to improve automatic DM segmentation for OCT-guided DALK procedures. By using the Kalman filter, the proposed method generates a smoother layer segmentation result from OCT M-mode images for more accurate tracking of the DM layer and epithelium. Initial ex vivo testing demonstrates that the proposed approach significantly increases the segmentation accuracy compared to conventional methods without the Kalman filter. Our proposed model can provide more consistent and precise depth sensing results, which has great potential to improve surgical safety and ultimately contributes to better patient outcomes.

We investigate the interpretability of our proposed biomarker-based lung ultrasound diagnostic pipeline to enhance clinicians' diagnostic capabilities. The objective of this study is to assess whether explanations from a decision tree classifier, utilizing biomarkers, can improve users' ability to identify inaccurate model predictions compared to conventional saliency maps. Our findings demonstrate that decision tree explanations, based on clinically established biomarkers, can assist clinicians in detecting false positives, thus improving the reliability of diagnostic models in medicine.

Title: Scaling Robust Optimization for Multi-Agent Robotic Systems: A Distributed Perspective
Authors: Arshiya Taj Abdul, Augustinos D. Saravanos, Evangelos A. Theodorou
Abstract: This paper presents a novel distributed robust optimization scheme for steering distributions of multi-agent systems under stochastic and deterministic uncertainty. Robust optimization is a subfield of optimization which aims to discover an optimal solution that remains robustly feasible for all possible realizations of the problem parameters within a given uncertainty set. Such approaches would naturally constitute an ideal candidate for multi-robot control, where in addition to stochastic noise, there might be exogenous deterministic disturbances. Nevertheless, as these methods are usually associated with significantly high computational demands, their application to multi-agent robotics has remained limited. The scope of this work is to propose a scalable robust optimization framework that effectively addresses both types of uncertainties, while retaining computational efficiency and scalability. In this direction, we provide tractable approximations for robust constraints that are relevant in multi-robot settings. Subsequently, we demonstrate how computations can be distributed through an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) approach towards achieving scalability and communication efficiency. All improvements are also theoretically justified by establishing and comparing the resulting computational complexities. Simulation results highlight the performance of the proposed algorithm in effectively handling both stochastic and deterministic uncertainty in multi-robot systems. The scalability of the method is also emphasized by showcasing tasks with up to hundreds of agents. The results of this work indicate the promise of blending robust optimization, distribution steering and distributed optimization towards achieving scalable, safe and robust multi-robot control.

Title: Dual Thinking and Logical Processing -- Are Multi-modal Large Language Models Closing the Gap with Human Vision ?
Authors: Kailas Dayanandan, Nikhil Kumar, Anand Sinha, Brejesh Lall
Abstract: The dual thinking framework considers fast, intuitive processing and slower, logical processing. The perception of dual thinking in vision requires images where inferences from intuitive and logical processing differ. We introduce an adversarial dataset to provide evidence for the dual thinking framework in human vision, which also aids in studying the qualitative behavior of deep learning models. The evidence underscores the importance of shape in identifying instances in human vision. Our psychophysical studies show the presence of multiple inferences in rapid succession, and analysis of errors shows the early stopping of visual processing can result in missing relevant information. Our study shows that segmentation models lack an understanding of sub-structures, as indicated by errors related to the position and number of sub-components. Additionally, the similarity in errors made by models and intuitive human processing indicates that models only address intuitive thinking in human vision. In contrast, multi-modal LLMs, including open-source models, demonstrate tremendous progress on errors made in intuitive processing. The models have improved performance on images that require logical reasoning and show recognition of sub-components. However, they have not matched the performance improvements made on errors in intuitive processing.

Title: End-to-end metasurface design for temperature imaging via broadband Planck-radiation regression
Authors: Sophie Fisher, Gaurav Arya, Arka Majumdar, Zin Lin, Steven G. Johnson
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for temperature imaging from long-wavelength infrared thermal radiation (e.g. 8-12 $\mu$m) through the end-to-end design of a metasurface-optics frontend and a computational-reconstruction backend. We introduce a new nonlinear reconstruction algorithm, ``Planck regression," that reconstructs the temperature map from a grayscale sensor image, even in the presence of severe chromatic aberration, by exploiting blackbody and optical physics particular to thermal imaging. We combine this algorithm with an end-to-end approach that optimizes a manufacturable, single-layer metasurface to yield the most accurate reconstruction. Our designs demonstrate high-quality, noise-robust reconstructions of arbitrary temperature maps (including completely random images) in simulations of an ultra-compact thermal-imaging device. We also show that Planck regression is much more generalizable to arbitrary images than a straightforward neural-network reconstruction, which requires a large training set of domain-specific images.

Title: MusicLIME: Explainable Multimodal Music Understanding
Authors: Theodoros Sotirou, Vassilis Lyberatos, Orfeas Menis Mastromichalakis, Giorgos Stamou
Abstract: Multimodal models are critical for music understanding tasks, as they capture the complex interplay between audio and lyrics. However, as these models become more prevalent, the need for explainability grows-understanding how these systems make decisions is vital for ensuring fairness, reducing bias, and fostering trust. In this paper, we introduce MusicLIME, a model-agnostic feature importance explanation method designed for multimodal music models. Unlike traditional unimodal methods, which analyze each modality separately without considering the interaction between them, often leading to incomplete or misleading explanations, MusicLIME reveals how audio and lyrical features interact and contribute to predictions, providing a holistic view of the model's decision-making. Additionally, we enhance local explanations by aggregating them into global explanations, giving users a broader perspective of model behavior. Through this work, we contribute to improving the interpretability of multimodal music models, empowering users to make informed choices, and fostering more equitable, fair, and transparent music understanding systems.

Title: Near-field Beam-focusing Pattern under Discrete Phase Shifters
Authors: Haodong Zhang, Changsheng You, Cong Zhou
Abstract: Extremely large-scale arrays (XL-arrays) have emerged as a promising technology for enabling near-field communications in future wireless systems. However, the huge number of antennas deployed pose demanding challenges on the hardware cost and power consumption, especially when the antennas employ high-resolution phase shifters (PSs). To address this issue, in this paper, we consider low-resolution discrete PSs at the XL-array which are practically more energy efficient, and investigate the impact of PS resolution on the near-field beam-focusing effect. To this end, we propose a new Fourier series expansion method to efficiently tackle the difficulty in characterizing the beam pattern properties under phase quantization. Interestingly, we analytically show, for the first time, that 1) discrete PSs introduce additional grating lobes; 2) the main lobe still exhibits the beam-focusing property with its beam power increasing with PS resolution; and 3) there are two types of grating lobes, featured by the beam-focusing and beam-steering properties, respectively. In addition, we provide intuitive understanding for the appearance of grating lobes under discrete PSs from an array-of-subarrays perspective. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the grating lobes generally degrade communication rate performance. However, a low-resolution of 3-bit PSs can achieve similar beam pattern and rate performance with the continuous PS counterpart, while it attains much higher energy efficiency.

Title: Remaining Useful Life Prediction for Batteries Utilizing an Explainable AI Approach with a Predictive Application for Decision-Making
Authors: Biplov Paneru, Bipul Thapa, Durga Prasad Mainali, Bishwash Paneru, Krishna Bikram Shah
Abstract: Accurately estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a battery is essential for determining its lifespan and recharge requirements. In this work, we develop machine learning-based models to predict and classify battery RUL. We introduce a two-level ensemble learning (TLE) framework and a CNN+MLP hybrid model for RUL prediction, comparing their performance against traditional, deep, and hybrid machine learning models. Our analysis evaluates various models for both prediction and classification while incorporating interpretability through SHAP. The proposed TLE model consistently outperforms baseline models in RMSE, MAE, and R squared error, demonstrating its superior predictive capabilities. Additionally, the XGBoost classifier achieves an impressive 99% classification accuracy, validated through cross-validation techniques. The models effectively predict relay-based charging triggers, enabling automated and energy-efficient charging processes. This automation reduces energy consumption and enhances battery performance by optimizing charging cycles. SHAP interpretability analysis highlights the cycle index and charging parameters as the most critical factors influencing RUL. To improve accessibility, we developed a Tkinter-based GUI that allows users to input new data and predict RUL in real time. This practical solution supports sustainable battery management by enabling data-driven decisions about battery usage and maintenance, contributing to energy-efficient and innovative battery life prediction.

Title: Fitting Multiple Machine Learning Models with Performance Based Clustering
Authors: Mehmet Efe Lorasdagi, Ahmet Berker Koc, Ali Taha Koc, Suleyman Serdar Kozat
Abstract: Traditional machine learning approaches assume that data comes from a single generating mechanism, which may not hold for most real life data. In these cases, the single mechanism assumption can result in suboptimal performance. We introduce a clustering framework that eliminates this assumption by grouping the data according to the relations between the features and the target values and we obtain multiple separate models to learn different parts of the data. We further extend our framework to applications having streaming data where we produce outcomes using an ensemble of models. For this, the ensemble weights are updated based on the incoming data batches. We demonstrate the performance of our approach over the widely-studied real life datasets, showing significant improvements over the traditional single-model approaches.

Title: Mean-Field Sampling for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Emile Anand, Ishani Karmarkar, Guannan Qu
Abstract: Designing efficient algorithms for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is fundamentally challenging because the size of the joint state and action spaces grows exponentially in the number of agents. These difficulties are exacerbated when balancing sequential global decision-making with local agent interactions. In this work, we propose a new algorithm $\texttt{SUBSAMPLE-MFQ}$ ($\textbf{Subsample}$-$\textbf{M}$ean-$\textbf{F}$ield-$\textbf{Q}$-learning) and a decentralized randomized policy for a system with $n$ agents. For $k\leq n$, our algorithm learns a policy for the system in time polynomial in $k$. We show that this learned policy converges to the optimal policy on the order of $\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$ as the number of subsampled agents $k$ increases. We empirically validate our method in Gaussian squeeze and global exploration settings.

Title: EmoDubber: Towards High Quality and Emotion Controllable Movie Dubbing
Authors: Gaoxiang Cong, Jiadong Pan, Liang Li, Yuankai Qi, Yuxin Peng, Anton van den Hengel, Jian Yang, Qingming Huang
Abstract: Given a piece of text, a video clip, and a reference audio, the movie dubbing task aims to generate speech that aligns with the video while cloning the desired voice. The existing methods have two primary deficiencies: (1) They struggle to simultaneously hold audio-visual sync and achieve clear pronunciation; (2) They lack the capacity to express user-defined emotions. To address these problems, we propose EmoDubber, an emotion-controllable dubbing architecture that allows users to specify emotion type and emotional intensity while satisfying high-quality lip sync and pronunciation. Specifically, we first design Lip-related Prosody Aligning (LPA), which focuses on learning the inherent consistency between lip motion and prosody variation by duration level contrastive learning to incorporate reasonable alignment. Then, we design Pronunciation Enhancing (PE) strategy to fuse the video-level phoneme sequences by efficient conformer to improve speech intelligibility. Next, the speaker identity adapting module aims to decode acoustics prior and inject the speaker style embedding. After that, the proposed Flow-based User Emotion Controlling (FUEC) is used to synthesize waveform by flow matching prediction network conditioned on acoustics prior. In this process, the FUEC determines the gradient direction and guidance scale based on the user's emotion instructions by the positive and negative guidance mechanism, which focuses on amplifying the desired emotion while suppressing others. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate favorable performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Real-Time Decision-Making for Digital Twin in Additive Manufacturing with Model Predictive Control using Time-Series Deep Neural Networks
Authors: Yi-Ping Chen, Vispi Karkaria, Ying-Kuan Tsai, Faith Rolark, Daniel Quispe, Robert X. Gao, Jian Cao, Wei Chen
Abstract: Digital Twin-a virtual replica of a physical system enabling real-time monitoring, model updating, prediction, and decision-making-combined with recent advances in machine learning (ML), offers new opportunities for proactive control strategies in autonomous manufacturing. However, achieving real-time decision-making with Digital Twins requires efficient optimization driven by accurate predictions of highly nonlinear manufacturing systems. This paper presents a simultaneous multi-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for real-time decision-making, using a multi-variate deep neural network (DNN), named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE), as the surrogate model. Different from the models in conventional MPC which only provide one-step ahead prediction, TiDE is capable of predicting future states within the prediction horizon in one shot (multi-step), significantly accelerating MPC. Using Directed Energy Deposition additive manufacturing as a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPC in achieving melt pool temperature tracking to ensure part quality, while reducing porosity defects by regulating laser power to maintain melt pool depth constraints. In this work, we first show that TiDE is capable of accurately predicting melt pool temperature and depth. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed MPC achieves precise temperature tracking while satisfying melt pool depth constraints within a targeted dilution range (10%-30%), reducing potential porosity defects. Compared to the PID controller, MPC results in smoother and less fluctuating laser power profiles with competitive or superior melt pool temperature control performance. This demonstrates MPC's proactive control capabilities, leveraging time-series prediction and real-time optimization, positioning it as a powerful tool for future Digital Twin applications and real-time process optimization in manufacturing.

Title: Unsupervised Learning in Echo State Networks for Input Reconstruction
Authors: Taiki Yamada, Yuichi Katori, Kantaro Fujiwara
Abstract: Conventional echo state networks (ESNs) require supervised learning to train the readout layer, using the desired outputs as training data. In this study, we focus on input reconstruction (IR), which refers to training the readout layer to reproduce the input time series in its output. We reformulate the learning algorithm of the ESN readout layer to perform IR using unsupervised learning (UL). By conducting theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we demonstrate that IR in ESNs can be effectively implemented under realistic conditions without explicitly using the desired outputs as training data; in this way, UL is enabled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that applications relying on IR, such as dynamical system replication and noise filtering, can be reformulated within the UL framework. Our findings establish a theoretically sound and universally applicable IR formulation, along with its related tasks in ESNs. This work paves the way for novel predictions and highlights unresolved theoretical challenges in ESNs, particularly in the context of time-series processing methods and computational models of the brain.

Title: Vision-based autonomous structural damage detection using data-driven methods
Authors: Seyyed Taghi Ataei, Parviz Mohammad Zadeh, Saeid Ataei
Abstract: This study addresses the urgent need for efficient and accurate damage detection in wind turbine structures, a crucial component of renewable energy infrastructure. Traditional inspection methods, such as manual assessments and non-destructive testing (NDT), are often costly, time-consuming, and prone to human error. To tackle these challenges, this research investigates advanced deep learning algorithms for vision-based structural health monitoring (SHM). A dataset of wind turbine surface images, featuring various damage types and pollution, was prepared and augmented for enhanced model training. Three algorithms-YOLOv7, its lightweight variant, and Faster R-CNN- were employed to detect and classify surface damage. The models were trained and evaluated on a dataset split into training, testing, and evaluation subsets (80%-10%-10%). Results indicate that YOLOv7 outperformed the others, achieving 82.4% mAP@50 and high processing speed, making it suitable for real-time inspections. By optimizing hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size, the models' accuracy and efficiency improved further. YOLOv7 demonstrated significant advancements in detection precision and execution speed, especially for real-time applications. However, challenges such as dataset limitations and environmental variability were noted, suggesting future work on segmentation methods and larger datasets. This research underscores the potential of vision-based deep learning techniques to transform SHM practices by reducing costs, enhancing safety, and improving reliability, thus contributing to the sustainable maintenance of critical infrastructure and supporting the longevity of wind energy systems.
