Title: Enhancing Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimators for Image Reconstruction
Authors: Ambrose Emmett-Iwaniw, Nathan Kirk
Abstract: Autoregressive models are often employed to learn distributions of image data by decomposing the $D$-dimensional density function into a product of one-dimensional conditional distributions. Each conditional depends on preceding variables (pixels, in the case of image data), making the order in which variables are processed fundamental to the model performance. In this paper, we study the problem of observing a small subset of image pixels (referred to as a pixel patch) to predict the unobserved parts of the image. As our prediction mechanism, we propose a generalized and computationally efficient version of the convolutional neural autoregressive distribution estimator (ConvNADE) model adapted for real-valued and color images. Moreover, we investigate the quality of image reconstruction when observing both random pixel patches and low-discrepancy pixel patches inspired by quasi-Monte Carlo theory. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that choosing the pixels akin to a low-discrepancy sequence reduces test loss and produces more realistic reconstructed images.

Title: Deep histological synthesis from mass spectrometry imaging for multimodal registration
Authors: Kimberley M. Bird, Xujiong Ye, Alan M. Race, James M. Brown
Abstract: Registration of histological and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) allows for more precise identification of structural changes and chemical interactions in tissue. With histology and MSI having entirely different image formation processes and dimensionalities, registration of the two modalities remains an ongoing challenge. This work proposes a solution that synthesises histological images from MSI, using a pix2pix model, to effectively enable unimodal registration. Preliminary results show promising synthetic histology images with limited artifacts, achieving increases in mutual information (MI) and structural similarity index measures (SSIM) of +0.924 and +0.419, respectively, compared to a baseline U-Net model.

Title: Meta-analysis of Life Cycle Assessments for Li-Ion Batteries Production Emissions
Authors: Maurizio Clemente, Prapti Maharjan, Mauro Salazar, Theo Hofman
Abstract: This paper investigates the environmental impact of Li-Ion batteries by quantifying manufacturing-related emissions and analyzing how electricity mix and production scale affect emission intensity. To this end, we conduct a meta-analysis of life cycle assessments on lithium-ion batteries published over the past two decades, categorizing them by year, battery chemistry, functional unit, system boundaries, and electricity mix. We then carry out a cradle-to-gate assessment for a nickel manganese cobalt 811 battery with a silicon-coated graphite anode, analyzing how variations in the carbon intensity of the electricity mix affect emissions, with case studies for China, South Korea, and Sweden. Finally, we develop a set of regression models that link annual battery production and the carbon intensity of China's electricity mix to the average mass-specific emissions observed each year. The meta-analysis shows a median global warming potential of 17.63 kg CO2-eq./kg of battery, with a standard deviation of 7.34. Differences in electricity mix mainly influence emissions from the energy-intensive cell production, particularly from cathode material processing. We found that a multivariate linear regression using production volume and the carbon intensity of the Chinese electricity mix as predictors explains emissions with moderate accuracy. The environmental impact of battery manufacturing can be reduced by using clean energy sources in production processes. However, achieving substantial reductions requires clean energy throughout the entire supply chain, as importing materials from regions with carbon-intensive electricity mixes can undermine these efforts. Our findings also highlight the emission-reducing effect of learning associated with increased production scale, supporting the integration of learning effects in future life cycle assessment models.

Title: UAV-Based Remote Sensing of Soil Moisture Across Diverse Land Covers: Validation and Bayesian Uncertainty Characterization
Authors: Runze Zhang, Ishfaq Aziz, Derek Houtz, Yuxiang Zhao, Trent W. Ford, Adam C. Watts, Mohamad Alipour
Abstract: High-resolution soil moisture (SM) observations are critical for agricultural monitoring, forestry management, and hazard prediction, yet current satellite passive microwave missions cannot directly provide retrievals at tens-of-meter spatial scales. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mounted microwave radiometry presents a promising alternative, but most evaluations to date have focused on agricultural settings, with limited exploration across other land covers and few efforts to quantify retrieval uncertainty. This study addresses both gaps by evaluating SM retrievals from a drone-based Portable L-band Radiometer (PoLRa) across shrubland, bare soil, and forest strips in Central Illinois, U.S., using a 10-day field campaign in 2024. Controlled UAV flights at altitudes of 10 m, 20 m, and 30 m were performed to generate brightness temperatures (TB) at spatial resolutions of 7 m, 14 m, and 21 m. SM retrievals were carried out using multiple tau-omega-based algorithms, including the single channel algorithm (SCA), dual channel algorithm (DCA), and multi-temporal dual channel algorithm (MTDCA). A Bayesian inference framework was then applied to provide probabilistic uncertainty characterization for both SM and vegetation optical depth (VOD). Results show that the gridded TB distributions consistently capture dry-wet gradients associated with vegetation density variations, and spatial correlations between polarized observations are largely maintained across scales. Validation against in situ measurements indicates that PoLRa derived SM retrievals from the SCAV and MTDCA algorithms achieve unbiased root-mean-square errors (ubRMSE) generally below 0.04 m3/m3 across different land covers. Bayesian posterior analyses confirm that reference SM values largely fall within the derived uncertainty intervals, with mean uncertainty ranges around 0.02 m3/m3 and 0.11 m3/m3 for SCA and DCA related retrievals.

Title: Low-Resource Domain Adaptation for Speech LLMs via Text-Only Fine-Tuning
Authors: Yangui Fang, Jing Peng, Xu Li, Yu Xi, Chengwei Zhang, Guohui Zhong, Kai Yu
Abstract: Recent advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) have combined speech encoders with large language models (LLMs) through projection, forming Speech LLMs with strong performance. However, adapting them to new domains remains challenging, especially in low-resource settings where paired speech-text data is scarce. We propose a text-only fine-tuning strategy for Speech LLMs using unpaired target-domain text without requiring additional audio. To preserve speech-text alignment, we introduce a real-time evaluation mechanism during fine-tuning. This enables effective domain adaptation while maintaining source-domain performance. Experiments on LibriSpeech, SlideSpeech, and Medical datasets show that our method achieves competitive recognition performance, with minimal degradation compared to full audio-text fine-tuning. It also improves generalization to new domains without catastrophic forgetting, highlighting the potential of text-only fine-tuning for low-resource domain adaptation of ASR.

Title: Bridging the Modality Gap: Softly Discretizing Audio Representation for LLM-based Automatic Speech Recognition
Authors: Mu Yang, Szu-Jui Chen, Jiamin Xie, John Hansen
Abstract: One challenge of integrating speech input with large language models (LLMs) stems from the discrepancy between the continuous nature of audio data and the discrete token-based paradigm of LLMs. To mitigate this gap, we propose a method for integrating vector quantization (VQ) into LLM-based automatic speech recognition (ASR). Using the LLM embedding table as the VQ codebook, the VQ module aligns the continuous representations from the audio encoder with the discrete LLM inputs, enabling the LLM to operate on a discretized audio representation that better reflects the linguistic structure. We further create a soft "discretization" of the audio representation by updating the codebook and performing a weighted sum over the codebook embeddings. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves upon the LLM-based ASR baseline, particularly in out-of-domain conditions. This work highlights the potential of soft discretization as a modality bridge in LLM-based ASR.

Title: The Geometry of Extended Kalman Filters on Manifolds with Affine Connection
Authors: Yixiao Ge, Pieter van Goor, Robert Mahony
Abstract: The extended Kalman filter (EKF) has been the industry standard for state estimation problems over the past sixty years. The classical formulation of the EKF is posed for nonlinear systems defined on global Euclidean spaces. The design methodology is regularly applied to systems on smooth manifolds by choosing local coordinates, however, it is well known that this approach is not intrinsic to the manifold and performance depends heavily on choosing 'good' coordinates. In this paper, we propose an extended Kalman filter that is adapted to the specific geometry of the manifold in question. We show that an affine connection and the concepts of parallel transport, torsion, and curvature are the key geometric structures that allow the formulation of a suitable family of intrinsic Gaussian-like distributions and provide the tools to understand how to propagate state estimates and fuse measurements. This leads us to propose novel geometric modifications to the propagation and update steps of the EKF and revisit recent work on the geometry of the reset step. The relative performance of the proposed geometric modifications are benchmarked against classical EKF and iterated EKF algorithms on a simplified inertial navigation system with direct pose measurements and no bias.

Title: TinyML-Based Adaptive Pulse Shaping for Edge Intelligence in IoT/IIoT
Authors: Afan Ali
Abstract: Edge intelligence in IoT and IIoT demands lightweight algorithms for data processing on resource-constrained devices. This paper introduces a novel adaptive pulse shape filter based on TinyML for PAPR and SER optimization on edge devices used in uplink IoT communication. Implemented on IoT nodes such as sensors, our pruned neural network provides up to 2 dB PAPR saving over root-raised-cosine (RRC) filters. Mass simulations validate its efficacy in DFT-s-OFDM systems and offer an energy-efficient and scalable solution for IoT/IIoT use cases such as smart factories and rural connectivity.

Title: Diarization-Aware Multi-Speaker Automatic Speech Recognition via Large Language Models
Authors: Yuke Lin, Ming Cheng, Ze Li, Beilong Tang, Ming Li
Abstract: Multi-speaker automatic speech recognition (MS-ASR) faces significant challenges in transcribing overlapped speech, a task critical for applications like meeting transcription and conversational analysis. While serialized output training (SOT)-style methods serve as common solutions, they often discard absolute timing information, limiting their utility in time-sensitive scenarios. Leveraging recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for conversational audio processing, we propose a novel diarization-aware multi-speaker ASR system that integrates speaker diarization with LLM-based transcription. Our framework processes structured diarization inputs alongside frame-level speaker and semantic embeddings, enabling the LLM to generate segment-level transcriptions. Experiments demonstrate that the system achieves robust performance in multilingual dyadic conversations and excels in complex, high-overlap multi-speaker meeting scenarios. This work highlights the potential of LLMs as unified back-ends for joint speaker-aware segmentation and transcription.

Title: TADA: Training-free Attribution and Out-of-Domain Detection of Audio Deepfakes
Authors: Adriana Stan, David Combei, Dan Oneata, Hora Cucu
Abstract: Deepfake detection has gained significant attention across audio, text, and image modalities, with high accuracy in distinguishing real from fake. However, identifying the exact source--such as the system or model behind a deepfake--remains a less studied problem. In this paper, we take a significant step forward in audio deepfake model attribution or source tracing by proposing a training-free, green AI approach based entirely on k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN). Leveraging a pre-trained self-supervised learning (SSL) model, we show that grouping samples from the same generator is straightforward--we obtain an 0.93 F1-score across five deepfake datasets. The method also demonstrates strong out-of-domain (OOD) detection, effectively identifying samples from unseen models at an F1-score of 0.84. We further analyse these results in a multi-dimensional approach and provide additional insights. All code and data protocols used in this work are available in our open repository: this https URL.

Title: Towards Next-Generation Intelligent Maintenance: Collaborative Fusion of Large and Small Models
Authors: Xiaoyi Yuan, Qiming Huang, Mingqing Guo, Huiming Ma, Ming Xu, Zeyi Liu, Xiao He
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of intelligent technologies, collaborative frameworks integrating large and small models have emerged as a promising approach for enhancing industrial maintenance. However, several challenges persist, including limited domain adaptability, insufficient real-time performance and reliability, high integration complexity, and difficulties in knowledge representation and fusion. To address these issues, an intelligent maintenance framework for industrial scenarios is proposed. This framework adopts a five-layer architecture and integrates the precise computational capabilities of domain-specific small models with the cognitive reasoning, knowledge integration, and interactive functionalities of large language models. The objective is to achieve more accurate, intelligent, and efficient maintenance in industrial applications. Two realistic implementations, involving the maintenance of telecommunication equipment rooms and the intelligent servicing of energy storage power stations, demonstrate that the framework significantly enhances maintenance efficiency.

Title: Field-of-View and Input Constrained Impact Time Guidance Against Stationary Targets
Authors: Swati Singh, Shashi Ranjan Kumar, Dwaipayan Mukherjee
Abstract: This paper proposes a guidance strategy to achieve time-constrained interception of stationary targets, taking into account both the bounded field-of-view (FOV) of seeker-equipped interceptors and the actuator's physical constraints. Actuator saturation presents a significant challenge in real-world systems, often resulting in degraded performance. However, since these limitations are typically known in advance, incorporating them into the guidance design can enhance overall performance. To address the FOV constraint, a time-to-go error-based approach is adopted. Furthermore, to incorporate the lateral acceleration constraints, the engagement kinematics are augmented with an input saturation model. Subsequently, the guidance strategy that constrains the lateral acceleration and the time-to-go values within their respective bounds is derived using Lyapunov stability concepts and the backstepping technique. Furthermore, a multi-stage approach is suggested to expand the achievable range of impact time. Numerical simulations are performed to validate the efficacy of the proposed scheme for different initial engagement geometries.

Title: On Level Crossings and Fade Durations in von Mises-Fisher Scattering Channels
Authors: Kenan Turbic, Slawomir Stanczak
Abstract: This paper investigates the second-order statistics of multipath fading channels with von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributed scatters. Simple closed-form expressions for the mean Doppler shift and Doppler spread are derived as the key spectral moments that capture the impact of mobility and scattering characteristics on level crossings and fade durations. These expressions are then used to analyze the influence of vMF parameters on the Level-Crossing Rate (LCR) The results show that isotropic scattering yields the highest LCR, while fading dynamics reduce with the decreasing angular spread of scatterers. Moreover, obile antenna motion parallel to the mean scattering direction results in a lower LCR than the perpendicular motion, with the difference between the two cases increasing with the higher concentration of scatterers.

Title: RSMA-Enabled Covert Communications Against Multiple Spatially Random Wardens
Authors: Xinyue Pei, Jihao Liu, Xuewen Luo, Xingwei Wang, Yingyang Chen, Miaowen Wen, Theodoros A. Tsiftsis
Abstract: This work investigates covert communication in a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-based multi-user multiple-input single-output system, where the random locations of the wardens follow a homogeneous Poisson point process. To demonstrate practical deployment scenarios, imperfect channel state information at the transmitter is considered. Closed-form expressions for the statistics of the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, along with the analytical formulations for the covertness constraint, outage probability, and effective covert throughput (ECT), are derived. Subsequently, an ECT maximization problem is formulated under covertness and power allocation constraints. This optimization problem is addressed using an alternating optimization-assisted genetic algorithm (AO-GA). Simulation results corroborate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the superiority of RSMA over conventional multiple access schemes, as well as the effectiveness of the proposed AO-GA.

Title: Multi-Modal Large Models Based Beam Prediction: An Example Empowered by DeepSeek
Authors: Yizhu Zhao, Li Yu, Lianzheng Shi, Jianhua Zhang, Guangyi Liu
Abstract: Beam prediction is an effective approach to reduce training overhead in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, existing beam prediction models still exhibit limited generalization ability in diverse scenarios, which remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we propose MLM-BP, a beam prediction framework based on the multi-modal large model released by DeepSeek, with full consideration of multi-modal environmental information. Specifically, the distribution of scatterers that impact the optimal beam is captured by the sensing devices. Then positions are tokenized to generate text-based representations, and multi-view images are processed by an image encoder, which is fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation (LoRA), to extract environmental embeddings. Finally, these embeddings are fed into the large model, and an output projection module is designed to determine the optimal beam index. Simulation results show that MLM-BP achieves 98.1% Top-1 accuracy on the simulation dataset. Additionally, it demonstrates few-shot generalization on a real-world dataset, achieving 72.7% Top-1 accuracy and 92.4% Top-3 accuracy with only 30% of the dataset, outperforming the existing small models by over 15%.

Title: A Flexible Design Framework for Integrated Communication and Computing Receivers
Authors: Kuranage Roche Rayan Ranasinghe, Kengo Ando, Hyeon Seok Rou, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, Takumi Takahashi, Marco Di Renzo, David González G
Abstract: We propose a framework to design integrated communication and computing (ICC) receivers capable of simultaneously detecting data symbols and performing over-the-air computing (AirComp) in a manner that: a) is systematically generalizable to any nomographic function, b) scales to a massive number of user equipments (UEs) and edge devices (EDs), c) supports the computation of multiple independent functions (streams), and d) operates in a multi-access fashion whereby each transmitter can choose to transmit either data symbols, computing signals or both. For the sake of illustration, we design the proposed multi-stream and multi-access method under an uplink setting, where multiple single-antenna UEs/EDs simultaneously transmit data and computing signals to a single multiple-antenna base station (BS)/access point (AP). Under the communication functionality, the receiver aims to detect all independent communication symbols while treating the computing streams as aggregate interference which it seeks to mitigate; and conversely, under the computing functionality, to minimize the distortion over the computing streams while minimizing their mutual interference as well as the interference due to data symbols. To that end, the design leverages the Gaussian belief propagation (GaBP) framework relying only on element-wise scalar operations coupled with closed-form combiners purpose-built for the AirComp operation, which allows for its use in massive settings, as demonstrated by simulation results incorporating up to 200 antennas and 300 UEs/EDs. The efficacy of the proposed method under different loading conditions is also evaluated, with the performance of the scheme shown to approach fundamental limiting bounds in the under/fully loaded cases.

Title: Dual Approach to Inverse Covariance Intersection Fusion
Authors: Jiří Ajgl, Ondřej Straka
Abstract: Linear fusion of estimates under the condition of no knowledge of correlation of estimation errors has reached maturity. On the other hand, various cases of partial knowledge are still active research areas. A frequent motivation is to deal with "common information" or "common noise", whatever it means. A fusion rule for a strict meaning of the former expression has already been elaborated. Despite the dual relationship, a strict meaning of the latter one has not been considered so far. The paper focuses on this area. The assumption of unknown "common noise" is formulated first, analysis of theoretical properties and illustrations follow. Although the results are disappointing from the perspective of a single upper bound of mean square error matrices, the partial knowledge demonstrates improvement over no knowledge in suboptimal cases and from the perspective of families of upper bounds.

Title: Applying XAI based unsupervised knowledge discovering for Operation modes in a WWTP. A real case: AQUAVALL WWTP
Authors: Alicia Beneyto-Rodriguez, Gregorio I. Sainz-Palmero, Marta Galende-Hernández, María J. Fuente, José M. Cuenca
Abstract: Water reuse is a key point when fresh water is a commodity in ever greater demand, but which is also becoming ever more available. Furthermore, the return of clean water to its natural environment is also mandatory. Therefore, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are essential in any policy focused on these serious challenges. WWTPs are complex facilities which need to operate at their best to achieve their goals. Nowadays, they are largely monitored, generating large databases of historical data concerning their functioning over time. All this implies a large amount of embedded information which is not usually easy for plant managers to assimilate, correlate and understand; in other words, for them to know the global operation of the plant at any given time. At this point, the intelligent and Machine Learning (ML) approaches can give support for that need, managing all the data and translating them into manageable, interpretable and explainable knowledge about how the WWTP plant is operating at a glance. Here, an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) based methodology is proposed and tested for a real WWTP, in order to extract explainable service knowledge concerning the operation modes of the WWTP managed by AQUAVALL, which is the public service in charge of the integral water cycle in the City Council of Valladolid (Castilla y León, Spain). By applying well-known approaches of XAI and ML focused on the challenge of WWTP, it has been possible to summarize a large number of historical databases through a few explained operation modes of the plant in a low-dimensional data space, showing the variables and facility units involved in each case.

Title: Reliable Evaluation of MRI Motion Correction: Dataset and Insights
Authors: Kun Wang, Tobit Klug, Stefan Ruschke, Jan S. Kirschke, Reinhard Heckel
Abstract: Correcting motion artifacts in MRI is important, as they can hinder accurate diagnosis. However, evaluating deep learning-based and classical motion correction methods remains fundamentally difficult due to the lack of accessible ground-truth target data. To address this challenge, we study three evaluation approaches: real-world evaluation based on reference scans, simulated motion, and reference-free evaluation, each with its merits and shortcomings. To enable evaluation with real-world motion artifacts, we release PMoC3D, a dataset consisting of unprocessed Paired Motion-Corrupted 3D brain MRI data. To advance evaluation quality, we introduce MoMRISim, a feature-space metric trained for evaluating motion reconstructions. We assess each evaluation approach and find real-world evaluation together with MoMRISim, while not perfect, to be most reliable. Evaluation based on simulated motion systematically exaggerates algorithm performance, and reference-free evaluation overrates oversmoothed deep learning outputs.

Title: Audio-Aware Large Language Models as Judges for Speaking Styles
Authors: Cheng-Han Chiang, Xiaofei Wang, Chung-Ching Lin, Kevin Lin, Linjie Li, Radu Kopetz, Yao Qian, Zhendong Wang, Zhengyuan Yang, Hung-yi Lee, Lijuan Wang
Abstract: Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) can understand the textual and non-textual information in the audio input. In this paper, we explore using ALLMs as an automatic judge to assess the speaking styles of speeches. We use ALLM judges to evaluate the speeches generated by SLMs on two tasks: voice style instruction following and role-playing. The speaking style we consider includes emotion, volume, speaking pace, word emphasis, pitch control, and non-verbal elements. We use four spoken language models (SLMs) to complete the two tasks and use humans and ALLMs to judge the SLMs' responses. We compare two ALLM judges, GPT-4o-audio and Gemini-2.5-pro, with human evaluation results and show that the agreement between Gemini and human judges is comparable to the agreement between human evaluators. These promising results show that ALLMs can be used as a judge to evaluate SLMs. Our results also reveal that current SLMs, even GPT-4o-audio, still have room for improvement in controlling the speaking style and generating natural dialogues.

Title: Equivariant Filter for Relative Attitude and Target Angular Velocity Estimation
Authors: Gil Serrano, Bruno J. Guerreiro, Pedro Lourenço, Rita Cunha
Abstract: Accurate estimation of the relative attitude and angular velocity between two rigid bodies is fundamental in aerospace applications such as spacecraft rendezvous and docking. In these scenarios, a chaser vehicle must determine the orientation and angular velocity of a target object using onboard sensors. This work addresses the challenge of designing an Equivariant Filter (EqF) that can reliably estimate both the relative attitude and the target angular velocity using noisy observations of two known, non-collinear vectors fixed in the target frame. To derive the EqF, a symmetry for the system is proposed and an equivariant lift onto the symmetry group is calculated. Observability and convergence properties are analyzed. Simulations demonstrate the filter's performance, with Monte Carlo runs yielding statistically significant results. The impact of low-rate measurements is also examined and a strategy to mitigate this effect is proposed. Experimental results, using fiducial markers and both conventional and event cameras for measurement acquisition, further validate the approach, confirming its effectiveness in a realistic setting.

Title: Trajectory Optimization for UAV-Based Medical Delivery with Temporal Logic Constraints and Convex Feasible Set Collision Avoidance
Authors: Kaiyuan Chen, Yuhan Suo, Shaowei Cui, Yuanqing Xia, Wannian Liang, Shuo Wang
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of trajectory optimization for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) performing time-sensitive medical deliveries in urban environments. Specifically, we consider a single UAV with 3 degree-of-freedom dynamics tasked with delivering blood packages to multiple hospitals, each with a predefined time window and priority. Mission objectives are encoded using Signal Temporal Logic (STL), enabling the formal specification of spatial-temporal constraints. To ensure safety, city buildings are modeled as 3D convex obstacles, and obstacle avoidance is handled through a Convex Feasible Set (CFS) method. The entire planning problem-combining UAV dynamics, STL satisfaction, and collision avoidance-is formulated as a convex optimization problem that ensures tractability and can be solved efficiently using standard convex programming techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method generates dynamically feasible, collision-free trajectories that satisfy temporal mission goals, providing a scalable and reliable approach for autonomous UAV-based medical logistics.

Title: Implicit Neural Representation-Based MRI Reconstruction Method with Sensitivity Map Constraints
Authors: Lixuan Rao, Xinlin Zhang, Yiman Huang, Tao Tan, Tong Tong
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a widely utilized diagnostic tool in clinical settings, but its application is limited by the relatively long acquisition time. As a result, fast MRI reconstruction has become a significant area of research. In recent years, Implicit Neural Representation (INR), as a scan-specific method, has demonstrated outstanding performance in fast MRI reconstruction without fully-sampled images for training. High acceleration reconstruction poses a challenging problem, and a key component in achieving high-quality reconstruction with much few data is the accurate estimation of coil sensitivity maps. However, most INR-based methods apply regularization constraints solely to the generated images, while overlooking the characteristics of the coil sensitivity maps. To handle this, this work proposes a joint coil sensitivity map and image estimation network, termed INR-CRISTAL. The proposed INR-CRISTAL introduces an extra sensitivity map regularization in the INR networks to make use of the smooth characteristics of the sensitivity maps. Experimental results show that INR-CRISTAL provides more accurate coil sensitivity estimates with fewer artifacts, and delivers superior reconstruction performance in terms of artifact removal and structure preservation. Moreover, INR-CRISTAL demonstrates stronger robustness to automatic calibration signals and the acceleration rate compared to existing methods.

Title: FPDANet: A Multi-Section Classification Model for Intelligent Screening of Fetal Ultrasound
Authors: Minglang Chen, Jie He, Caixu Xu, Bocheng Liang, Shengli Li, Guannan He, Xiongjie Tao
Abstract: ResNet has been widely used in image classification tasks due to its ability to model the residual dependence of constant mappings for linear computation. However, the ResNet method adopts a unidirectional transfer of features and lacks an effective method to correlate contextual information, which is not effective in classifying fetal ultrasound images in the classification task, and fetal ultrasound images have problems such as low contrast, high similarity, and high noise. Therefore, we propose a bilateral multi-scale information fusion network-based FPDANet to address the above challenges. Specifically, we design the positional attention mechanism (DAN) module, which utilizes the similarity of features to establish the dependency of different spatial positional features and enhance the feature representation. In addition, we design a bilateral multi-scale (FPAN) information fusion module to capture contextual and global feature dependencies at different feature scales, thereby further improving the model representation. FPDANet classification results obtained 91.05\% and 100\% in Top-1 and Top-5 metrics, respectively, and the experimental results proved the effectiveness and robustness of FPDANet.

Title: Direct Integration of Recursive Gaussian Process Regression Into Extended Kalman Filters With Application to Vapor Compression Cycle Control
Authors: Ricus Husmann, Sven Weishaupt, Harald Aschemann
Abstract: This paper presents a real-time capable algorithm for the learning of Gaussian Processes (GP) for submodels. It extends an existing recursive Gaussian Process (RGP) algorithm which requires a measurable output. In many applications, however, an envisaged GP output is not directly measurable. Therefore, we present the integration of an RGP into an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for the combined state estimation and GP learning. The algorithm is successfully tested in simulation studies and outperforms two alternative implementations -- especially if high measurement noise is present. We conclude the paper with an experimental validation within the control structure of a Vapor Compression Cycle typically used in refrigeration and heat pumps. In this application, the algorithm is used to learn a GP model for the heat-transfer values in dependency of several process parameters. The GP model significantly improves the tracking performance of a previously published model-based controller.

Title: CO-VADA: A Confidence-Oriented Voice Augmentation Debiasing Approach for Fair Speech Emotion Recognition
Authors: Yun-Shao Tsai, Yi-Cheng Lin, Huang-Cheng Chou, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: Bias in speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often stems from spurious correlations between speaker characteristics and emotional labels, leading to unfair predictions across demographic groups. Many existing debiasing methods require model-specific changes or demographic annotations, limiting their practical use. We present CO-VADA, a Confidence-Oriented Voice Augmentation Debiasing Approach that mitigates bias without modifying model architecture or relying on demographic information. CO-VADA identifies training samples that reflect bias patterns present in the training data and then applies voice conversion to alter irrelevant attributes and generate samples. These augmented samples introduce speaker variations that differ from dominant patterns in the data, guiding the model to focus more on emotion-relevant features. Our framework is compatible with various SER models and voice conversion tools, making it a scalable and practical solution for improving fairness in SER systems.

Title: Data-driven nonlinear output regulation via data-enforced incremental passivity
Authors: Yixuan Liu, Meichen Guo
Abstract: This work proposes a data-driven regulator design that drives the output of a nonlinear system asymptotically to a time-varying reference and rejects time-varying disturbances. The key idea is to design a data-driven feedback controller such that the closed-loop system is incrementally passive with respect to the regulation error and a virtual input. By carefully designing the virtual input, we solve the data-driven nonlinear output regulation problem where the reference and disturbances are generated by a linear exosystem. The designed regulator is composed of an internal model and a passivation feedback controller characterized by a set of data-dependent linear matrix inequalities. The proposed data-driven method is also applied to stabilizing the non-zero equilibrium of a class of nonlinear systems with unknown equilibrium input. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed designs.

Title: Distribution-Level AirComp for Wireless Federated Learning under Data Scarcity and Heterogeneity
Authors: Jun-Pyo Hong, Hyowoon Seo, Kisong Lee
Abstract: The conventional FL methods face critical challenges in realistic wireless edge networks, where training data is both limited and heterogeneous, often leading to unstable training and poor generalization. To address these challenges in a principled manner, we propose a novel wireless FL framework grounded in Bayesian inference. By virtue of the Bayesian approach, our framework captures model uncertainty by maintaining distributions over local weights and performs distribution-level aggregation of local distributions into a global distribution. This mitigates local overfitting and client drift, thereby enabling more reliable inference. Nevertheless, adopting Bayesian FL increases communication overhead due to the need to transmit richer model information and fundamentally alters the aggregation process beyond simple averaging. As a result, conventional Over-the-Air Computation (AirComp), widely used to improve communication efficiency in standard FL, is no longer directly applicable. To overcome this limitation, we design a dedicated AirComp scheme tailored to Bayesian FL, which efficiently aggregates local posterior distributions at the distribution level by exploiting the superposition property of wireless channels. In addition, we derive an optimal transmit power control strategy, grounded in rigorous convergence analysis, to accelerate training under power constraints. Our analysis explicitly accounts for practical wireless impairments such as fading and noise, and provides theoretical guarantees for convergence. Extensive simulations validate the proposed framework, demonstrating significant improvements in test accuracy and calibration performance over conventional FL methods, particularly in data-scarce and heterogeneous environments.

Title: LinGuinE: Longitudinal Guidance Estimation for Volumetric Lung Tumour Segmentation
Authors: Nadine Garibli, Mayank Patwari, Bence Csiba, Yi Wei, Kostas Sidiropoulos
Abstract: Segmentation of lung gross tumour volumes is an important first step in radiotherapy and surgical intervention, and is starting to play a role in assessing chemotherapy response. Response to a drug is measured by tracking the tumour volumes over a series of CT scans over a time period i.e. a longitudinal study. However, there currently exist few solutions for automated or semi-automated longitudinal tumour segmentation. This paper introduces LinGuinE, an automated method to segment a longitudinal series of lung tumours. A radiologist must provide an initial input, indicating the location of the tumour in a CT scan at an arbitrary time point. LinGuinE samples points inside this tumour and propagates them to another time point using rigid registration. A click validity classifier selects points which still fall within the tumour; these are used to automatically create a segmentation in the new time point. We test LinGuinE on a dataset acquired from a phase 3 clinical trial for lung tumours and the publicly available 4-D lung CBCT dataset. We find that LinGuinE improves the Dice on both test sets by over 20% (p< 0.05) across 63 longitudinal studies. We show that any time point can be used as a starting point, conduct ablation experiments, and find that our LinGuinE setup yields the best results on both test datasets.

Title: DermaCon-IN: A Multi-concept Annotated Dermatological Image Dataset of Indian Skin Disorders for Clinical AI Research
Authors: Shanawaj S Madarkar, Mahajabeen Madarkar, Madhumitha V, Teli Prakash, Konda Reddy Mopuri, Vinaykumar MV, KVL Sathwika, Adarsh Kasturi, Gandla Dilip Raj, PVN Supranitha, Harsh Udai
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is poised to augment dermatological care by enabling scalable image-based diagnostics. Yet, the development of robust and equitable models remains hindered by datasets that fail to capture the clinical and demographic complexity of real-world practice. This complexity stems from region-specific disease distributions, wide variation in skin tones, and the underrepresentation of outpatient scenarios from non-Western populations. We introduce DermaCon-IN, a prospectively curated dermatology dataset comprising over 5,450 clinical images from approximately 3,000 patients across outpatient clinics in South India. Each image is annotated by board-certified dermatologists with over 240 distinct diagnoses, structured under a hierarchical, etiology-based taxonomy adapted from Rook's classification. The dataset captures a wide spectrum of dermatologic conditions and tonal variation commonly seen in Indian outpatient care. We benchmark a range of architectures including convolutional models (ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet), transformer-based models (ViT, MaxViT, Swin), and Concept Bottleneck Models to establish baseline performance and explore how anatomical and concept-level cues may be integrated. These results are intended to guide future efforts toward interpretable and clinically realistic models. DermaCon-IN provides a scalable and representative foundation for advancing dermatology AI in real-world settings.

Title: Spectral Derivatives
Authors: Pavel Komarov
Abstract: One of the happiest accidents in all math is the ease of transforming a function to and taking derivatives in the Fourier frequency domain. But in order to exploit this extraordinary fact without serious artefacting, and in order to be able to use a computer, we need quite a bit of extra knowledge and care. This document sets out the math behind the spectral-derivatives Python package. I touch on fundamental signal processing and calculus concepts as necessary and build upwards.

Title: Statistical Guarantees in Data-Driven Nonlinear Control: Conformal Robustness for Stability and Safety
Authors: Ting-Wei Hsu, Hiroyasu Tsukamoto
Abstract: We present a true-dynamics-agnostic, statistically rigorous framework for establishing exponential stability and safety guarantees of closed-loop, data-driven nonlinear control. Central to our approach is the novel concept of conformal robustness, which robustifies the Lyapunov and zeroing barrier certificates of data-driven dynamical systems against model prediction uncertainties using conformal prediction. It quantifies these uncertainties by leveraging rank statistics of prediction scores over system trajectories, without assuming any specific underlying structure of the prediction model or distribution of the uncertainties. With the quantified uncertainty information, we further construct the conformally robust control Lyapunov function (CR-CLF) and control barrier function (CR-CBF), data-driven counterparts of the CLF and CBF, for fully data-driven control with statistical guarantees of finite-horizon exponential stability and safety. The performance of the proposed concept is validated in numerical simulations with four benchmark nonlinear control problems.

Title: Lightweight Prompt Biasing for Contextualized End-to-End ASR Systems
Authors: Bo Ren, Yu Shi, Jinyu Li
Abstract: End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has advanced significantly yet still struggles with rare and domain-specific entities. This paper introduces a simple yet efficient prompt-based biasing technique for contextualized ASR, enhancing recognition accuracy by leverage a unified multitask learning framework. The approach comprises two key components: a prompt biasing model which is trained to determine when to focus on entities in prompt, and a entity filtering mechanism which efficiently filters out irrelevant entities. Our method significantly enhances ASR accuracy on entities, achieving a relative 30.7% and 18.0% reduction in Entity Word Error Rate compared to the baseline model with shallow fusion on in-house domain dataset with small and large entity lists, respectively. The primary advantage of this method lies in its efficiency and simplicity without any structure change, making it lightweight and highly efficient.

Title: A Compendium of Autonomous Navigation using Object Detection and Tracking in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
Authors: Mohit Arora, Pratyush Shukla, Shivali Chopra
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are one of the most revolutionary inventions of 21st century. At the core of a UAV lies the central processing system that uses wireless signals to control their movement. The most popular UAVs are quadcopters that use a set of four motors, arranged as two on either side with opposite spin. An autonomous UAV is called a drone. Drones have been in service in the US army since the 90's for covert missions critical to national security. It would not be wrong to claim that drones make up an integral part of the national security and provide the most valuable service during surveillance operations. While UAVs are controlled using wireless signals, there reside some challenges that disrupt the operation of such vehicles such as signal quality and range, real time processing, human expertise, robust hardware and data security. These challenges can be solved by programming UAVs to be autonomous, using object detection and tracking, through Computer Vision algorithms. Computer Vision is an interdisciplinary field that seeks the use of deep learning to gain a high-level understanding of digital images and videos for the purpose of automating the task of human visual system. Using computer vision, algorithms for detecting and tracking various objects can be developed suitable to the hardware so as to allow real time processing for immediate judgement. This paper attempts to review the various approaches several authors have proposed for the purpose of autonomous navigation of UAVs by through various algorithms of object detection and tracking in real time, for the purpose of applications in various fields such as disaster management, dense area exploration, traffic vehicle surveillance etc.

Title: Heterogeneous Secure Transmissions in IRS-Assisted NOMA Communications: CO-GNN Approach
Authors: Linlin Liang, Zongkai Tian, Haiyan Huang, Xiaoyan Li, Zhisheng Yin, Dehua Zhang, Nina Zhang, Wenchao Zhai
Abstract: Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) enhance spectral efficiency by adjusting reflection phase shifts, while Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) increases system capacity. Consequently, IRS-assisted NOMA communications have garnered significant research interest. However, the passive nature of the IRS, lacking authentication and security protocols, makes these systems vulnerable to external eavesdropping due to the openness of electromagnetic signal propagation and reflection. NOMA's inherent multi-user signal superposition also introduces internal eavesdropping risks during user pairing. This paper investigates secure transmissions in IRS-assisted NOMA systems with heterogeneous resource configuration in wireless networks to mitigate both external and internal eavesdropping. To maximize the sum secrecy rate of legitimate users, we propose a combinatorial optimization graph neural network (CO-GNN) approach to jointly optimize beamforming at the base station, power allocation of NOMA users, and phase shifts of IRS for dynamic heterogeneous resource allocation, thereby enabling the design of dual-link or multi-link secure transmissions in the presence of eavesdroppers on the same or heterogeneous links. The CO-GNN algorithm simplifies the complex mathematical problem-solving process, eliminates the need for channel estimation, and enhances scalability. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly enhances the secure transmission performance of the system.

Title: TriPSS: A Tri-Modal Keyframe Extraction Framework Using Perceptual, Structural, and Semantic Representations
Authors: Mert Can Cakmak, Nitin Agarwal, Diwash Poudel
Abstract: Efficient keyframe extraction is critical for effective video summarization and retrieval, yet capturing the complete richness of video content remains challenging. In this work, we present TriPSS, a novel tri-modal framework that effectively integrates perceptual cues from color features in the CIELAB space, deep structural embeddings derived from ResNet-50, and semantic context from frame-level captions generated by Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. By fusing these diverse modalities using principal component analysis, TriPSS constructs robust multi-modal embeddings that enable adaptive segmentation of video content via HDBSCAN clustering. A subsequent refinement stage incorporating quality assessment and duplicate filtering ensures that the final keyframe set is both concise and semantically rich. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets TVSum20 and SumMe demonstrate that TriPSS achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming traditional unimodal and previous multi-modal methods. These results underscore TriPSS's ability to capture nuanced visual and semantic information, thereby setting a new benchmark for video content understanding in large-scale retrieval scenarios.

Title: Talk2SAM: Text-Guided Semantic Enhancement for Complex-Shaped Object Segmentation
Authors: Luka Vetoshkin, Dmitry Yudin
Abstract: Segmenting objects with complex shapes, such as wires, bicycles, or structural grids, remains a significant challenge for current segmentation models, including the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its high-quality variant SAM-HQ. These models often struggle with thin structures and fine boundaries, leading to poor segmentation quality. We propose Talk2SAM, a novel approach that integrates textual guidance to improve segmentation of such challenging objects. The method uses CLIP-based embeddings derived from user-provided text prompts to identify relevant semantic regions, which are then projected into the DINO feature space. These features serve as additional prompts for SAM-HQ, enhancing its ability to focus on the target object. Beyond improving segmentation accuracy, Talk2SAM allows user-controllable segmentation, enabling disambiguation of objects within a single bounding box based on textual input. We evaluate our approach on three benchmarks: BIG, ThinObject5K, and DIS5K. Talk2SAM consistently outperforms SAM-HQ, achieving up to +5.9\% IoU and +8.3\% boundary IoU improvements. Our results demonstrate that incorporating natural language guidance provides a flexible and effective means for precise object segmentation, particularly in cases where traditional prompt-based methods fail.

Title: SAVVY: Spatial Awareness via Audio-Visual LLMs through Seeing and Hearing
Authors: Mingfei Chen, Zijun Cui, Xiulong Liu, Jinlin Xiang, Caleb Zheng, Jingyuan Li, Eli Shlizerman
Abstract: 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic, audio-visual environments is a cornerstone of human cognition yet remains largely unexplored by existing Audio-Visual Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and benchmarks, which predominantly focus on static or 2D scenes. We introduce SAVVY-Bench, the first benchmark for 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized spatial audio. SAVVY-Bench is comprised of thousands of relationships involving static and moving objects, and requires fine-grained temporal grounding, consistent 3D localization, and multi-modal annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose SAVVY, a novel training-free reasoning pipeline that consists of two stages: (i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation, which leverages AV-LLMs as well as other audio-visual methods to track the trajectories of key objects related to the query using both visual and spatial audio cues, and (ii) Dynamic Global Map Construction, which aggregates multi-modal queried object trajectories and converts them into a unified global dynamic map. Using the constructed map, a final QA answer is obtained through a coordinate transformation that aligns the global map with the queried viewpoint. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that SAVVY substantially enhances performance of state-of-the-art AV-LLMs, setting a new standard and stage for approaching dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in AV-LLMs.

Title: U-NetMN and SegNetMN: Modified U-Net and SegNet models for bimodal SAR image segmentation
Authors: Marwane Kzadri, Franco Alberto Cardillo, Nanée Chahinian, Carole Delenne, Renaud Hostache, Jamal Riffi
Abstract: Segmenting Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is crucial for many remote sensing applications, particularly water body detection. However, deep learning-based segmentation models often face challenges related to convergence speed and stability, mainly due to the complex statistical distribution of this type of data. In this study, we evaluate the impact of mode normalization on two widely used semantic segmentation models, U-Net and SegNet. Specifically, we integrate mode normalization, to reduce convergence time while maintaining the performance of the baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that mode normalization significantly accelerates convergence. Furthermore, cross-validation results indicate that normalized models exhibit increased stability in different zones. These findings highlight the effectiveness of normalization in improving computational efficiency and generalization in SAR image segmentation.

Title: Channel Estimation with Asynchronous Reception for User-Centric Cell-Free MIMO Systems
Authors: Xuyang Sun, Hussein A. Ammar, Raviraj Adve, Israfil Bahceci, Gary Boudreau
Abstract: The user-centric, cell-free wireless network is a promising next-generation communication system, but signal synchronization issues arise due to distributed access points and lack of cellular structure. We propose a novel method to recover synchronous pilot reception by introducing new pilot sequences and a matched filter window, enabling orthogonality even with asynchronous reception. Our approach mimics synchronous transmission by extending training sequences. Analysis shows asynchronous reception's impact on channel estimation, and our method significantly improves performance with a small increase of training time overhead. Results demonstrate a 7.26 dB reduction in normalized mean square error and 40% increase in data rate, achieving performance levels comparable to the synchronous case.

Title: Fluid Antenna System-Assisted Self-Interference Cancellation for In-Band Full Duplex Communications
Authors: Hanjiang Hong, Kai-Kit Wong, Hao Xu, Yiyan Wu, Sai Xu, Chan-Byoung Chae, Baiyang Liu, Kin-Fai Tong
Abstract: In-band full-duplex (IBFD) systems are expected to double the spectral efficiency compared to half-duplex systems, provided that loopback self-interference (SI) can be effectively suppressed. The inherent interference mitigation capabilities of the emerging fluid antenna system (FAS) technology make it a promising candidate for addressing the SI challenge in IBFD systems. This paper thus proposes a FAS-assisted self-interference cancellation (SIC) framework, which leverages a receiver-side FAS to dynamically select an interference-free port. Analytical results include a lower bound and an approximation of the residual SI (RSI) power, both derived for rich-scattering channels by considering the joint spatial correlation amongst the FAS ports. Simulations of RSI power and forward link rates validate the analysis, showing that the SIC performance improves with the number of FAS ports. Additionally, simulations under practical conditions, such as finite-scattering environments and wideband integrated access and backhaul (IAB) channels, reveal that the proposed approach offers superior SIC capability and significant forward rate gains over conventional IBFD SIC schemes.

Title: Improving Neural Diarization through Speaker Attribute Attractors and Local Dependency Modeling
Authors: David Palzer, Matthew Maciejewski, Eric Fosler-Lussier
Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end approaches have made notable progress in addressing the challenge of speaker diarization, which involves segmenting and identifying speakers in multi-talker recordings. One such approach, Encoder-Decoder Attractors (EDA), has been proposed to handle variable speaker counts as well as better guide the network during training. In this study, we extend the attractor paradigm by moving beyond direct speaker modeling and instead focus on representing more detailed `speaker attributes' through a multi-stage process of intermediate representations. Additionally, we enhance the architecture by replacing transformers with conformers, a convolution-augmented transformer, to model local dependencies. Experiments demonstrate improved diarization performance on the CALLHOME dataset.

Title: Joint User Association and Beamforming Design for ISAC Networks with Large Language Models
Authors: Haoyun Li, Ming Xiao, Kezhi Wang, Robert Schober, Dong In Kim, Yong Liang Guan
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been envisioned to play a more important role in future wireless networks. However, the design of ISAC networks is challenging, especially when there are multiple communication and sensing (C\&S) nodes and multiple sensing targets. We investigate a multi-base station (BS) ISAC network in which multiple BSs equipped with multiple antennas simultaneously provide C\&S services for multiple ground communication users (CUs) and targets. To enhance the overall performance of C\&S, we formulate a joint user association (UA) and multi-BS transmit beamforming optimization problem with the objective of maximizing the total sum rate of all CUs while ensuring both the minimum target detection and parameter estimation requirements. To efficiently solve the highly non-convex mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) optimization problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm that decomposes the problem into two sub-problems, i.e., UA optimization and multi-BS transmit beamforming optimization. Inspired by large language models (LLMs) for prediction and inference, we propose a unified framework integrating LLMs with convex-based optimization methods. First, we propose a comprehensive design of prompt engineering, including few-shot, chain of thought, and self-reflection techniques to guide LLMs in solving the binary integer programming UA optimization problem. Second, we utilize convex-based optimization methods to handle the non-convex beamforming optimization problem based on fractional programming (FP), majorization minimization (MM), and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with an optimized UA from LLMs. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed LLM-enabled AO-based algorithm achieves fast convergence and near upper-bound performance with the GPT-o1 model, outperforming various benchmark schemes.

Title: Aerial Multi-View Stereo via Adaptive Depth Range Inference and Normal Cues
Authors: Yimei Liu, Yakun Ju, Yuan Rao, Hao Fan, Junyu Dong, Feng Gao, Qian Du
Abstract: Three-dimensional digital urban reconstruction from multi-view aerial images is a critical application where deep multi-view stereo (MVS) methods outperform traditional techniques. However, existing methods commonly overlook the key differences between aerial and close-range settings, such as varying depth ranges along epipolar lines and insensitive feature-matching associated with low-detailed aerial images. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Depth Range MVS (ADR-MVS), which integrates monocular geometric cues to improve multi-view depth estimation accuracy. The key component of ADR-MVS is the depth range predictor, which generates adaptive range maps from depth and normal estimates using cross-attention discrepancy learning. In the first stage, the range map derived from monocular cues breaks through predefined depth boundaries, improving feature-matching discriminability and mitigating convergence to local optima. In later stages, the inferred range maps are progressively narrowed, ultimately aligning with the cascaded MVS framework for precise depth regression. Moreover, a normal-guided cost aggregation operation is specially devised for aerial stereo images to improve geometric awareness within the cost volume. Finally, we introduce a normal-guided depth refinement module that surpasses existing RGB-guided techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that ADR-MVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WHU, LuoJia-MVS, and München datasets, while exhibits superior computational complexity.

Title: Voice Impression Control in Zero-Shot TTS
Authors: Keinichi Fujita, Shota Horiguchi, Yusuke Ijima
Abstract: Para-/non-linguistic information in speech is pivotal in shaping the listeners' impression. Although zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) has achieved high speaker fidelity, modulating subtle para-/non-linguistic information to control perceived voice characteristics, i.e., impressions, remains challenging. We have therefore developed a voice impression control method in zero-shot TTS that utilizes a low-dimensional vector to represent the intensities of various voice impression pairs (e.g., dark-bright). The results of both objective and subjective evaluations have demonstrated our method's effectiveness in impression control. Furthermore, generating this vector via a large language model enables target-impression generation from a natural language description of the desired impression, thus eliminating the need for manual optimization.

Title: Latent Diffusion Model Based Denoising Receiver for 6G Semantic Communication: From Stochastic Differential Theory to Application
Authors: Xiucheng Wang, Honggang Jia, Nan Cheng, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: In this paper, a novel semantic communication framework empowered by generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is proposed, specifically leveraging the capabilities of diffusion models (DMs). A rigorous theoretical foundation is established based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which elucidates the denoising properties of DMs in mitigating additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) in latent semantic representations. Crucially, a closed-form analytical relationship between the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the denoising timestep is derived, enabling the optimal selection of diffusion parameters for any given channel condition. To address the distribution mismatch between the received signal and the DM's training data, a mathematically principled scaling mechanism is introduced, ensuring robust performance across a wide range of SNRs without requiring model fine-tuning. Built upon this theoretical insight, we develop a latent diffusion model (LDM)-based semantic transceiver, wherein a variational autoencoder (VAE) is employed for efficient semantic compression, and a pretrained DM serves as a universal denoiser. Notably, the proposed architecture is fully training-free at inference time, offering high modularity and compatibility with large-scale pretrained LDMs. This design inherently supports zero-shot generalization and mitigates the challenges posed by out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms conventional neural-network-based semantic communication baselines, particularly under low SNR conditions and distributional shifts, thereby establishing a promising direction for GAI-driven robust semantic transmission in future 6G systems.

Title: DeepFake Doctor: Diagnosing and Treating Audio-Video Fake Detection
Authors: Marcel Klemt, Carlotta Segna, Anna Rohrbach
Abstract: Generative AI advances rapidly, allowing the creation of very realistic manipulated video and audio. This progress presents a significant security and ethical threat, as malicious users can exploit DeepFake techniques to spread misinformation. Recent DeepFake detection approaches explore the multimodal (audio-video) threat scenario. In particular, there is a lack of reproducibility and critical issues with existing datasets - such as the recently uncovered silence shortcut in the widely used FakeAVCeleb dataset. Considering the importance of this topic, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the key issues affecting benchmarking in audio-video DeepFake detection. We examine these challenges through the lens of the three core benchmarking pillars: datasets, detection methods, and evaluation protocols. To address these issues, we spotlight the recent DeepSpeak v1 dataset and are the first to propose an evaluation protocol and benchmark it using SOTA models. We introduce SImple Multimodal BAseline (SIMBA), a competitive yet minimalistic approach that enables the exploration of diverse design choices. We also deepen insights into the issue of audio shortcuts and present a promising mitigation strategy. Finally, we analyze and enhance the evaluation scheme on the widely used FakeAVCeleb dataset. Our findings offer a way forward in the complex area of audio-video DeepFake detection.

Title: NILMFormer: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring that Accounts for Non-Stationarity
Authors: Adrien Petralia, Philippe Charpentier, Youssef Kadhi, Themis Palpanas
Abstract: Millions of smart meters have been deployed worldwide, collecting the total power consumed by individual households. Based on these data, electricity suppliers offer their clients energy monitoring solutions to provide feedback on the consumption of their individual appliances. Historically, such estimates have relied on statistical methods that use coarse-grained total monthly consumption and static customer data, such as appliance ownership. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is the problem of disaggregating a household's collected total power consumption to retrieve the consumed power for individual appliances. Current state-of-the-art (SotA) solutions for NILM are based on deep-learning (DL) and operate on subsequences of an entire household consumption reading. However, the non-stationary nature of real-world smart meter data leads to a drift in the data distribution within each segmented window, which significantly affects model performance. This paper introduces NILMFormer, a Transformer-based architecture that incorporates a new subsequence stationarization/de-stationarization scheme to mitigate the distribution drift and that uses a novel positional encoding that relies only on the subsequence's timestamp information. Experiments with 4 real-world datasets show that NILMFormer significantly outperforms the SotA approaches. Our solution has been deployed as the backbone algorithm for EDF's (Electricité De France) consumption monitoring service, delivering detailed insights to millions of customers about their individual appliances' power consumption. This paper appeared in KDD 2025.

Title: WAKE: Watermarking Audio with Key Enrichment
Authors: Yaoxun Xu, Jianwei Yu, Hangting Chen, Zhiyong Wu, Xixin Wu, Dong Yu, Rongzhi Gu, Yi Luo
Abstract: As deep learning advances in audio generation, challenges in audio security and copyright protection highlight the need for robust audio watermarking. Recent neural network-based methods have made progress but still face three main issues: preventing unauthorized access, decoding initial watermarks after multiple embeddings, and embedding varying lengths of watermarks. To address these issues, we propose WAKE, the first key-controllable audio watermark framework. WAKE embeds watermarks using specific keys and recovers them with corresponding keys, enhancing security by making incorrect key decoding impossible. It also resolves the overwriting issue by allowing watermark decoding after multiple embeddings and supports variable-length watermark insertion. WAKE outperforms existing models in both watermarked audio quality and watermark detection accuracy. Code, more results, and demo page: this https URL.

Title: WhisQ: Cross-Modal Representation Learning for Text-to-Music MOS Prediction
Authors: Jakaria Islam Emon, Kazi Tamanna Alam, Md. Abu Salek
Abstract: Mean Opinion Score (MOS) prediction for text to music systems requires evaluating both overall musical quality and text prompt alignment. This paper introduces WhisQ, a multimodal architecture that addresses this dual-assessment challenge through sequence level co-attention and optimal transport regularization. WhisQ employs the Whisper Base pretrained model for temporal audio encoding and Qwen 3, a 0.6B Small Language Model (SLM), for text encoding, with both maintaining sequence structure for fine grained cross-modal modeling. The architecture features specialized prediction pathways: OMQ is predicted from pooled audio embeddings, while TA leverages bidirectional sequence co-attention between audio and text. Sinkhorn optimal transport loss further enforce semantic alignment in the shared embedding space. On the MusicEval Track-1 dataset, WhisQ achieves substantial improvements over the baseline: 7% improvement in Spearman correlation for OMQ and 14% for TA. Ablation studies reveal that optimal transport regularization provides the largest performance gain (10% SRCC improvement), demonstrating the importance of explicit cross-modal alignment for text-to-music evaluation.

Title: DeviceScope: An Interactive App to Detect and Localize Appliance Patterns in Electricity Consumption Time Series
Authors: Adrien Petralia, Paul Boniol, Philippe Charpentier, Themis Palpanas
Abstract: In recent years, electricity suppliers have installed millions of smart meters worldwide to improve the management of the smart grid system. These meters collect a large amount of electrical consumption data to produce valuable information to help consumers reduce their electricity footprint. However, having non-expert users (e.g., consumers or sales advisors) understand these data and derive usage patterns for different appliances has become a significant challenge for electricity suppliers because these data record the aggregated behavior of all appliances. At the same time, ground-truth labels (which could train appliance detection and localization models) are expensive to collect and extremely scarce in practice. This paper introduces DeviceScope, an interactive tool designed to facilitate understanding smart meter data by detecting and localizing individual appliance patterns within a given time period. Our system is based on CamAL (Class Activation Map-based Appliance Localization), a novel weakly supervised approach for appliance localization that only requires the knowledge of the existence of an appliance in a household to be trained. This paper appeared in ICDE 2025.

Title: A Proximal Variable Smoothing for Minimization of Nonlinearly Composite Nonsmooth Function -- Maxmin Dispersion and MIMO Applications
Authors: Keita Kume, Isao Yamada
Abstract: We propose a proximal variable smoothing algorithm for a nonsmooth optimization problem whose cost function is the sum of three functions including a weakly convex composite function. The proposed algorithm has a single-loop structure inspired by a proximal gradient-type method. More precisely, the proposed algorithm consists of two steps: (i) a gradient descent of a time-varying smoothed surrogate function designed partially with the Moreau envelope of the weakly convex function; (ii) an application of the proximity operator of the remaining function not covered by the smoothed surrogate function. We also present a convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm by exploiting a novel asymptotic approximation of a gradient mapping-type stationarity measure. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in two scenarios: (i) maxmin dispersion problem and (ii) multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) signal detection.

Title: Capacity of MIMO Systems Aided by Microwave Linear Analog Computers (MiLACs)
Authors: Matteo Nerini, Bruno Clerckx
Abstract: Future wireless systems, known as gigantic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), are expected to enhance performance by significantly increasing the number of antennas, e.g., a few thousands. To enable gigantic MIMO overcoming the scalability limitations of digital architectures, microwave linear analog computers (MiLACs) have recently emerged. A MiLAC is a multiport microwave network that processes input microwave signals entirely in the analog domain, thereby reducing hardware costs and computational complexity of gigantic MIMO architectures. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental limits on the rate achievable in MiLAC-aided MIMO systems. We model a MIMO system employing MiLAC-aided beamforming at the transmitter and receiver, and formulate the rate maximization problem to optimize the microwave networks of the MiLACs, which are assumed lossless and reciprocal for practical reasons. Under the lossless and reciprocal constraints, we derive a global optimal solution for the microwave networks of the MiLACs in closed form. In addition, we also characterize in closed-form the capacity of MIMO systems operating MiLAC-aided beamforming. Our theoretical analysis, confirmed by numerical simulations, reveals that MiLAC-aided beamforming achieves the same capacity as digital beamforming, while significantly reducing the number of radio frequency (RF) chains, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs)/digital-to-analog converters (DACs) resolution requirements, and computational complexity.

Title: Enhanced Trust Region Sequential Convex Optimization for Multi-Drone Thermal Screening Trajectory Planning in Urban Environments
Authors: Kaiyuan Chen, Zhengjie Hu, Shaolin Zhang, Yuanqing Xia, Wannian Liang, Shuo Wang
Abstract: The rapid detection of abnormal body temperatures in urban populations is essential for managing public health risks, especially during outbreaks of infectious diseases. Multi-drone thermal screening systems offer promising solutions for fast, large-scale, and non-intrusive human temperature monitoring. However, trajectory planning for multiple drones in complex urban environments poses significant challenges, including collision avoidance, coverage efficiency, and constrained flight environments. In this study, we propose an enhanced trust region sequential convex optimization (TR-SCO) algorithm for optimal trajectory planning of multiple drones performing thermal screening tasks. Our improved algorithm integrates a refined convex optimization formulation within a trust region framework, effectively balancing trajectory smoothness, obstacle avoidance, altitude constraints, and maximum screening coverage. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves trajectory optimality and computational efficiency compared to conventional convex optimization methods. This research provides critical insights and practical contributions toward deploying efficient multi-drone systems for real-time thermal screening in urban areas. For reader who are interested in our research, we release our source code at this https URL.

Title: Some remarks on stochastic converse Lyapunov theorems
Authors: Pavel Osinenko, Grigory Yaremenko
Abstract: In this brief note, we investigate some constructions of Lyapunov functions for stochastic discrete-time stabilizable dynamical systems, in other words, controlled Markov chains. The main question here is whether a Lyapunov function in some statistical sense exists if the respective controlled Markov chain admits a stabilizing policy. We demonstrate some constructions extending on the classical results for deterministic systems. Some limitations of the constructed Lyapunov functions for stabilization are discussed, particularly for stabilization in mean. Although results for deterministic systems are well known, the stochastic case was addressed in less detail, which the current paper remarks on. A distinguishable feature of this work is the study of stabilizers that possess computationally tractable convergence certificates.

Title: Label-Context-Dependent Internal Language Model Estimation for CTC
Authors: Zijian Yang, Minh-Nghia Phan, Ralf Schlüter, Hermann Ney
Abstract: Although connectionist temporal classification (CTC) has the label context independence assumption, it can still implicitly learn a context-dependent internal language model (ILM) due to modern powerful encoders. In this work, we investigate the implicit context dependency modeled in the ILM of CTC. To this end, we propose novel context-dependent ILM estimation methods for CTC based on knowledge distillation (KD) with theoretical justifications. Furthermore, we introduce two regularization methods for KD. We conduct experiments on Librispeech and TED-LIUM Release 2 datasets for in-domain and cross-domain evaluation, respectively. Experimental results show that context-dependent ILMs outperform the context-independent priors in cross-domain evaluation, indicating that CTC learns a context-dependent ILM. The proposed label-level KD with smoothing method surpasses other ILM estimation approaches, with more than 13% relative improvement in word error rate compared to shallow fusion.

Title: SATversary: Adversarial Attacks on Satellite Fingerprinting
Authors: Joshua Smailes, Sebastian Köhler, Simon Birnbach, Martin Strohmeier, Ivan Martinovic
Abstract: As satellite systems become increasingly vulnerable to physical layer attacks via SDRs, novel countermeasures are being developed to protect critical systems, particularly those lacking cryptographic protection, or those which cannot be upgraded to support modern cryptography. Among these is transmitter fingerprinting, which provides mechanisms by which communication can be authenticated by looking at characteristics of the transmitter, expressed as impairments on the signal. Previous works show that fingerprinting can be used to classify satellite transmitters, or authenticate them against SDR-equipped attackers under simple replay scenarios. In this paper we build upon this by looking at attacks directly targeting the fingerprinting system, with an attacker optimizing for maximum impact in jamming, spoofing, and dataset poisoning attacks, and demonstrate these attacks on the SatIQ system designed to authenticate Iridium transmitters. We show that an optimized jamming signal can cause a 50% error rate with attacker-to-victim ratios as low as -30dB (far less power than traditional jamming) and demonstrate successful identity forgery during spoofing attacks, with an attacker successfully removing their own transmitter's fingerprint from messages. We also present a data poisoning attack, enabling persistent message spoofing by altering the data used to authenticate incoming messages to include the fingerprint of the attacker's transmitter. Finally, we show that our model trained to optimize spoofing attacks can also be used to detect spoofing and replay attacks, even when it has never seen the attacker's transmitter before. Furthermore, this technique works even when the training dataset includes only a single transmitter, enabling fingerprinting to be used to protect small constellations and even individual satellites, providing additional protection where it is needed the most.

Title: Inverse-designed nanophotonic neural network accelerators for ultra-compact optical computing
Authors: Joel Sved, Shijie Song, Liwei Li, George Li, Debin Meng, Xiaoke Yi
Abstract: Inverse-designed nanophotonic devices offer promising solutions for analog optical computation. High-density photonic integration is critical for scaling such architectures toward more complex computational tasks and large-scale applications. Here, we present an inverse-designed photonic neural network (PNN) accelerator on a high-index contrast material platform, enabling ultra-compact and energy-efficient optical computing. Our approach introduces a wave-based inverse-design method based on three dimensional finite-difference time-domain (3D-FDTD) simulations, exploiting the linearity of Maxwell's equations to reconstruct arbitrary spatial fields through optical coherence. By decoupling the forward-pass process into linearly separable simulations, our approach is highly amenable to computational parallelism, making it particularly well suited for acceleration using graphics processing units (GPUs) and other parallel computing platforms, thereby enhancing scalability across large problem domains. We fabricate and experimentally validate two inverse-designed PNN accelerators on the silicon-on-insulator platform, achieving on-chip MNIST and MedNIST classification accuracies of 89% and 90% respectively, within ultra-compact footprints of just 20 $\times$ 20 $\mu$m$^{2}$ and 30 $\times$ 20 $\mu$m$^{2}$. Our results establish a scalable and energy-efficient platform for analog photonic computing, effectively bridging inverse nanophotonic design with high-performance optical information processing.

Title: Resource Allocation for Pinching-Antenna Systems: State-of-the-Art, Key Techniques and Open Issues
Authors: Ming Zeng, Ji Wang, Octavia A. Dobre, Zhiguo Ding, George K. Karagiannidis, Robert Schober, H. Vincent Poor
Abstract: Pinching antennas have emerged as a promising technology for reconfiguring wireless propagation environments, particularly in high-frequency communication systems operating in the millimeter-wave and terahertz bands. By enabling dynamic activation at arbitrary positions along a dielectric waveguide, pinching antennas offer unprecedented channel reconfigurability and the ability to provide line-of-sight (LoS) links in scenarios with severe LoS blockages. The performance of pinching-antenna systems is highly dependent on the optimized placement of the pinching antennas, which must be jointly considered with traditional resource allocation (RA) variables -- including transmission power, time slots, and subcarriers. The resulting joint RA problems are typically non-convex with complex variable coupling, necessitating sophisticated optimization techniques. This article provides a comprehensive survey of existing RA algorithms designed for pinching-antenna systems, supported by numerical case studies that demonstrate their potential performance gains. Key challenges and open research problems are also identified to guide future developments in this emerging field.

Title: NAT: Neural Acoustic Transfer for Interactive Scenes in Real Time
Authors: Xutong Jin, Bo Pang, Chenxi Xu, Xinyun Hou, Guoping Wang, Sheng Li
Abstract: Previous acoustic transfer methods rely on extensive precomputation and storage of data to enable real-time interaction and auditory feedback. However, these methods struggle with complex scenes, especially when dynamic changes in object position, material, and size significantly alter sound effects. These continuous variations lead to fluctuating acoustic transfer distributions, making it challenging to represent with basic data structures and render efficiently in real time. To address this challenge, we present Neural Acoustic Transfer, a novel approach that utilizes an implicit neural representation to encode precomputed acoustic transfer and its variations, allowing for real-time prediction of sound fields under varying conditions. To efficiently generate the training data required for the neural acoustic field, we developed a fast Monte-Carlo-based boundary element method (BEM) approximation for general scenarios with smooth Neumann conditions. Additionally, we implemented a GPU-accelerated version of standard BEM for scenarios requiring higher precision. These methods provide the necessary training data, enabling our neural network to accurately model the sound radiation space. We demonstrate our method's numerical accuracy and runtime efficiency (within several milliseconds for 30s audio) through comprehensive validation and comparisons in diverse acoustic transfer scenarios. Our approach allows for efficient and accurate modeling of sound behavior in dynamically changing environments, which can benefit a wide range of interactive applications such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and advanced audio production.

Abstract: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent mental health condition, and a deeper understanding of its neurocognitive foundations is essential for identifying how core functions such as emotional and self-referential processing are affected. We investigate how depression alters the temporal dynamics of emotional processing by measuring neural responses to self-referential affective sentences using surface electroencephalography (EEG) in healthy and depressed individuals. Our results reveal significant group-level differences in neural activity during sentence viewing, suggesting disrupted integration of emotional and self-referential information in depression. Deep learning model trained on these responses achieves an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.707 in distinguishing healthy from depressed participants, and 0.624 in differentiating depressed subgroups with and without suicidal ideation. Spatial ablations highlight anterior electrodes associated with semantic and affective processing as key contributors. These findings suggest stable, stimulus-driven neural signatures of depression that may inform future diagnostic tools.

Title: Quadratic Extended and Unscented Kalman Filter Updates
Authors: Simone Servadio, Chiran Cherian
Abstract: Common filters are usually based on the linear approximation of the optimal minimum mean square error estimator. The Extended and Unscented Kalman Filters handle nonlinearity through linearization and unscented transformation, respectively, but remain linear estimators, meaning that the state estimate is a linear function of the measurement. This paper proposes a quadratic approximation of the optimal estimator, creating the Quadratic Extended and Quadratic Unscented Kalman Filter. These retain the structure of their linear counterpart, but include information from the measurement square to obtain a more accurate estimate. Numerical results show the benefits in accuracy of the new technique, which can be generalized to upgrade other linear estimators to their quadratic versions.

Title: PyGemini: Unified Software Development towards Maritime Autonomy Systems
Authors: Kjetil Vasstein, Christian Le, Simon Lervåg Breivik, Trygve Maukon Myhr, Annette Stahl, Edmund Førland Brekke
Abstract: Ensuring the safety and certifiability of autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) requires robust decision-making systems, supported by extensive simulation, testing, and validation across a broad range of scenarios. However, the current landscape of maritime autonomy development is fragmented -- relying on disparate tools for communication, simulation, monitoring, and system integration -- which hampers interdisciplinary collaboration and inhibits the creation of compelling assurance cases, demanded by insurers and regulatory bodies. Furthermore, these disjointed tools often suffer from performance bottlenecks, vendor lock-in, and limited support for continuous integration workflows. To address these challenges, we introduce PyGemini, a permissively licensed, Python-native framework that builds on the legacy of Autoferry Gemini to unify maritime autonomy development. PyGemini introduces a novel Configuration-Driven Development (CDD) process that fuses Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), data-oriented design, and containerization to support modular, maintainable, and scalable software architectures. The framework functions as a stand-alone application, cloud-based service, or embedded library -- ensuring flexibility across research and operational contexts. We demonstrate its versatility through a suite of maritime tools -- including 3D content generation for simulation and monitoring, scenario generation for autonomy validation and training, and generative artificial intelligence pipelines for augmenting imagery -- thereby offering a scalable, maintainable, and performance-oriented foundation for future maritime robotics and autonomy research.

Title: Integrating Complexity and Biological Realism: High-Performance Spiking Neural Networks for Breast Cancer Detection
Authors: Zofia Rudnicka, Januszcz Szczepanski, Agnieszka Pregowska
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) event-driven nature enables efficient encoding of spatial and temporal features, making them suitable for dynamic time-dependent data processing. Despite their biological relevance, SNNs have seen limited application in medical image recognition due to difficulties in matching the performance of conventional deep learning models. To address this, we propose a novel breast cancer classification approach that combines SNNs with Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC) a computationally efficient measure of sequence complexity. LZC enhances the interpretability and accuracy of spike-based models by capturing structural patterns in neural activity. Our study explores both biophysical Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) and probabilistic Levy-Baxter (LB) neuron models under supervised, unsupervised, and hybrid learning regimes. Experiments were conducted on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset using numerical features derived from medical imaging. LB-based models consistently exceeded 90.00% accuracy, while LIF-based models reached over 85.00%. The highest accuracy of 98.25% was achieved using an ANN-to-SNN conversion method applied to both neuron models comparable to traditional deep learning with back-propagation, but at up to 100 times lower computational cost. This hybrid approach merges deep learning performance with the efficiency and plausibility of SNNs, yielding top results at lower computational cost. We hypothesize that the synergy between temporal-coding, spike-sparsity, and LZC-driven complexity analysis enables more-efficient feature extraction. Our findings demonstrate that SNNs combined with LZC offer promising, biologically plausible alternative to conventional neural networks in medical diagnostics, particularly for resource-constrained or real-time systems.

Title: Design Tasks and Their Complexity for the European Train Control System with Hybrid Train Detection
Authors: Stefan Engels, Tom Peham, Judith Przigoda, Nils Przigoda, Robert Wille
Abstract: Railway networks have become increasingly important in recent times, especially in moving freight and public transportation from road traffic and planes to more environmentally friendly trains. Since expanding the global railway network is time- and resource-consuming, maximizing the rail capacity of the existing infrastructure is desirable. However, simply running more trains is infeasible as certain constraints enforced by the train control system must be satisfied. The capacity of a network depends (amongst others) on the distance between trains allowed by this safety system. While most signaling systems rely on fixed blocks defined by costly hardware, new specifications provided by Level 2 with Hybrid Train Detection of the European Train Control System (ETCS L2 HTD), formerly known as ETCS Hybrid Level 3, allow the usage of virtual subsections. This additional degree of freedom allows for shorter train following times and, thus, more trains on existing railway tracks. On the other hand, new design tasks arise on which automated methods might be helpful for designers of modern railway networks. However, although first approaches exist that solve design problems arising within ETCS L2 HTD, neither formal descriptions nor results on the computational complexity of the corresponding design tasks exist. In this paper, we fill this gap by providing a formal description of design tasks for ETCS L2 HTD and proof that these tasks are NP-complete or NP-hard, respectively. By that, we are providing a solid basis for the future development of methods to solve those tasks, which will be integrated into the Munich Train Control Toolkit available open-source on GitHub at this https URL.

Title: Relax, Estimate, and Track: a Simple Battery State-of-charge and State-of-health Estimation Method
Authors: Shida Jiang, Junzhe Shi, Scott Moura
Abstract: Battery management is a critical component of ubiquitous battery-powered energy systems, in which battery state-of-charge (SOC) and state-of-health (SOH) estimations are of crucial importance. Conventional SOC and SOH estimation methods, especially model-based methods, often lack accurate modeling of the open circuit voltage (OCV), have relatively high computational complexity, and lack theoretical analysis. This study introduces a simple SOC and SOH estimation method that overcomes all these weaknesses. The key idea of the proposed method is to momentarily set the cell's current to zero for a few minutes during the charging, perform SOC and SOH estimation based on the measured data, and continue tracking the cell's SOC afterward. The method is based on rigorous theoretical analysis, requires no hyperparameter fine-tuning, and is hundreds of times faster than conventional model-based methods. The method is validated on six batteries charged at different C rates and temperatures, realizing fast and accurate estimations under various conditions, with a SOH root mean square error (RMSE) of around 3% and a SOC RMSE of around 1.5%. The data and codes are available at this https URL.

Title: LDPM: Towards undersampled MRI reconstruction with MR-VAE and Latent Diffusion Prior
Authors: Xingjian Tang, Jingwei Guan, Linge Li, Ran Shi, Youmei Zhang, Mengye Lyu, Li Yan
Abstract: Diffusion models, as powerful generative models, have found a wide range of applications and shown great potential in solving image reconstruction problems. Some works attempted to solve MRI reconstruction with diffusion models, but these methods operate directly in pixel space, leading to higher computational costs for optimization and inference. Latent diffusion models, pre-trained on natural images with rich visual priors, are expected to solve the high computational cost problem in MRI reconstruction by operating in a lower-dimensional latent space. However, direct application to MRI reconstruction faces three key challenges: (1) absence of explicit control mechanisms for medical fidelity, (2) domain gap between natural images and MR physics, and (3) undefined data consistency in latent space. To address these challenges, a novel Latent Diffusion Prior-based undersampled MRI reconstruction (LDPM) method is proposed. Our LDPM framework addresses these challenges by: (1) a sketch-guided pipeline with a two-step reconstruction strategy, which balances perceptual quality and anatomical fidelity, (2) an MRI-optimized VAE (MR-VAE), which achieves an improvement of approximately 3.92 dB in PSNR for undersampled MRI reconstruction compared to that with SD-VAE \cite{sd}, and (3) Dual-Stage Sampler, a modified version of spaced DDPM sampler, which enforces high-fidelity reconstruction in the latent space. Experiments on the fastMRI dataset\cite{fastmri} demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method and its robustness across various scenarios. The effectiveness of each module is also verified through ablation experiments.

Title: Audiobox TTA-RAG: Improving Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Text-To-Audio with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
Authors: Mu Yang, Bowen Shi, Matthew Le, Wei-Ning Hsu, Andros Tjandra
Abstract: This work focuses on improving Text-To-Audio (TTA) generation on zero-shot and few-shot settings (i.e. generating unseen or uncommon audio events). Inspired by the success of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in Large Language Models, we propose Audiobox TTA-RAG, a novel retrieval-augmented TTA approach based on Audiobox, a flow-matching audio generation model. Unlike the vanilla Audiobox TTA solution that generates audio conditioned on text only, we extend the TTA process by augmenting the conditioning input with both text and retrieved audio samples. Our retrieval method does not require the external database to have labeled audio, offering more practical use cases. We show that the proposed model can effectively leverage the retrieved audio samples and significantly improve zero-shot and few-shot TTA performance, with large margins on multiple evaluation metrics, while maintaining the ability to generate semantically aligned audio for the in-domain setting.

Title: Sketched Equivariant Imaging Regularization and Deep Internal Learning for Inverse Problems
Authors: Guixian Xu, Jinglai Li, Junqi Tang
Abstract: Equivariant Imaging (EI) regularization has become the de-facto technique for unsupervised training of deep imaging networks, without any need of ground-truth data. Observing that the EI-based unsupervised training paradigm currently has significant computational redundancy leading to inefficiency in high-dimensional applications, we propose a sketched EI regularization which leverages the randomized sketching techniques for acceleration. We apply our sketched EI regularization to develop an accelerated deep internal learning framework, which can be efficiently applied for test-time network adaptation. Additionally, for network adaptation tasks, we propose a parameter-efficient approach to accelerate both EI and Sketched-EI via optimizing only the normalization layers. Our numerical study on X-ray CT and multicoil magnetic resonance image reconstruction tasks demonstrate that our approach can achieve significant computational acceleration over standard EI counterpart in single-input setting and network adaptation at test time.

Title: An Ensemble-Based Two-Step Framework for Classification of Pap Smear Cell Images
Authors: Theo Di Piazza, Loic Boussel
Abstract: Early detection of cervical cancer is crucial for improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality by identifying precancerous lesions as soon as possible. As a result, the use of pap smear screening has significantly increased, leading to a growing demand for automated tools that can assist cytologists managing their rising workload. To address this, the Pap Smear Cell Classification Challenge (PS3C) has been organized in association with ISBI in 2025. This project aims to promote the development of automated tools for pap smear images classification. The analyzed images are grouped into four categories: healthy, unhealthy, both, and rubbish images which are considered as unsuitable for diagnosis. In this work, we propose a two-stage ensemble approach: first, a neural network determines whether an image is rubbish or not. If not, a second neural network classifies the image as containing a healthy cell, an unhealthy cell, or both.

Title: Aging-aware Energy Management for Residential Multi-Carrier Energy Systems
Authors: Darío Slaifstein (1), Gautham Ram Chandra Mouli (1), Laura Ramirez-Elizondo (1), Pavol Bauer (1) ((1) Delft University of Technology)
Abstract: In the context of building electrification, the operation of distributed energy resources integrating multiple energy carriers (electricity, heat, mobility) poses a significant challenge due to the nonlinear device dynamics, uncertainty, and computational issues. As such, energy management systems seek to decide set points for the primary control layer in the best way possible. The objective is to minimize and balance operative costs (energy bills or asset degradation) with user requirements (mobility, heating, etc.). This paper presents a novel aging-aware day-ahead algorithm for electrified buildings. The proposed energy management algorithm incorporates physics-based battery aging models to enhance the operational performance, making explicit the trade-off between grid cost and battery degradation. The proposed day-ahead algorithm can either cut-down on grid costs or extend battery lifetime (electric vehicle or static packs). Moreover, it exploits the differences between cathode chemistries improving grid costs by 25\% when using LFP cells, with respect to NMC cells. Finally the performance using aged batteries is also enhanced, with respect to the benchmarks.

Title: On relaxing the N-Reachability Implicit Requirement in NMPC Design
Authors: Mazen Alamir
Abstract: This paper proposes a proof of stability for Model Predictive Control formulations involving a prediction horizon that might be too short to meet the reachability condition generally invoked as a sufficient condition for closed-loop stability. This condition is replaced by a contraction condition on the stage cost. But unlike the contraction based existing formulations where the prediction horizon becomes a decision variable, the formulation proposed in this paper remains standard in that it uses constant and short prediction horizon. An illustrative example is provided to assess the relevance of the proposed formulation.

Title: Improving Generalization in MRI-Based Deep Learning Models for Total Knee Replacement Prediction
Authors: Ehsan Karami, Hamid Soltanian-Zadeh
Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common joint disease that causes pain and mobility issues. While MRI-based deep learning models have demonstrated superior performance in predicting total knee replacement (TKR) and disease progression, their generalizability remains challenging, particularly when applied to imaging data from different sources. In this study, we have shown that replacing batch normalization with instance normalization, using data augmentation, and applying contrastive loss improves model generalization in a baseline deep learning model for knee osteoarthritis (KOA) prediction. We trained and evaluated our model using MRI data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) database, considering sagittal fat-suppressed intermediate-weighted turbo spin-echo (FS-IW-TSE) images as the source domain and sagittal fat-suppressed three-dimensional (3D) dual-echo in steady state (DESS) images as the target domain. The results demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in classification accuracy across both domains, with our approach outperforming the baseline model.

Title: Towards Robust Multimodal Physiological Foundation Models: Handling Arbitrary Missing Modalities
Authors: Wei-Bang Jiang, Xi Fu, Yi Ding, Cuntai Guan
Abstract: Multimodal physiological signals, such as EEG, ECG, EOG, and EMG, are crucial for healthcare and brain-computer interfaces. While existing methods rely on specialized architectures and dataset-specific fusion strategies, they struggle to learn universal representations that generalize across datasets and handle missing modalities at inference time. To address these issues, we propose PhysioOmni, a foundation model for multimodal physiological signal analysis that models both homogeneous and heterogeneous features to decouple multimodal signals and extract generic representations while maintaining compatibility with arbitrary missing modalities. PhysioOmni trains a decoupled multimodal tokenizer, enabling masked signal pre-training via modality-invariant and modality-specific objectives. To ensure adaptability to diverse and incomplete modality combinations, the pre-trained encoders undergo resilient fine-tuning with prototype alignment on downstream datasets. Extensive experiments on four downstream tasks, emotion recognition, sleep stage classification, motor prediction, and mental workload detection, demonstrate that PhysioOmni achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining strong robustness to missing modalities. Our code and model weights will be released.

Title: Ophora: A Large-Scale Data-Driven Text-Guided Ophthalmic Surgical Video Generation Model
Authors: Wei Li, Ming Hu, Guoan Wang, Lihao Liu, Kaijin Zhou, Junzhi Ning, Xin Guo, Zongyuan Ge, Lixu Gu, Junjun He
Abstract: In ophthalmic surgery, developing an AI system capable of interpreting surgical videos and predicting subsequent operations requires numerous ophthalmic surgical videos with high-quality annotations, which are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns and labor consumption. Text-guided video generation (T2V) emerges as a promising solution to overcome this issue by generating ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. In this paper, we present Ophora, a pioneering model that can generate ophthalmic surgical videos following natural language instructions. To construct Ophora, we first propose a Comprehensive Data Curation pipeline to convert narrative ophthalmic surgical videos into a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising over 160K video-instruction pairs, Ophora-160K. Then, we propose a Progressive Video-Instruction Tuning scheme to transfer rich spatial-temporal knowledge from a T2V model pre-trained on natural video-text datasets for privacy-preserved ophthalmic surgical video generation based on Ophora-160K. Experiments on video quality evaluation via quantitative analysis and ophthalmologist feedback demonstrate that Ophora can generate realistic and reliable ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. We also validate the capability of Ophora for empowering downstream tasks of ophthalmic surgical workflow understanding. Code is available at this https URL.

Title: Rate-Accuracy Bounds in Visual Coding for Machines
Authors: Ivan V. Bajić
Abstract: Increasingly, visual signals such as images, videos and point clouds are being captured solely for the purpose of automated analysis by computer vision models. Applications include traffic monitoring, robotics, autonomous driving, smart home, and many others. This trend has led to the need to develop compression strategies for these signals for the purpose of analysis rather than reconstruction, an area often referred to as "coding for machines." By drawing parallels with lossy coding of a discrete memoryless source, in this paper we derive rate-accuracy bounds on several popular problems in visual coding for machines, and compare these with state-of-the-art results from the literature. The comparison shows that the current results are at least an order of magnitude -- and in some cases two or three orders of magnitude -- away from the theoretical bounds in terms of the bitrate needed to achieve a certain level of accuracy. This, in turn, means that there is much room for improvement in the current methods for visual coding for machines.

Title: Distributed Expectation Propagation for Multi-Object Tracking over Sensor Networks
Authors: Qing Li, Runze Gan, James R. Hopgood, Michael E. Davies, Simon J. Godsill
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel distributed expectation propagation algorithm for multiple sensors, multiple objects tracking in cluttered environments. The proposed framework enables each sensor to operate locally while collaboratively exchanging moment estimates with other sensors, thus eliminating the need to transmit all data to a central processing node. Specifically, we introduce a fast and parallelisable Rao-Blackwellised Gibbs sampling scheme to approximate the tilted distributions, which enhances the accuracy and efficiency of expectation propagation updates. Results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves both communication and inference efficiency for multi-object tracking tasks with dynamic sensor connectivity and varying clutter levels.

Abstract: Gastrointestinal (GI) diseases represent a clinically significant burden, necessitating precise diagnostic approaches to optimize patient outcomes. Conventional histopathological diagnosis suffers from limited reproducibility and diagnostic variability. To overcome these limitations, we develop Digepath, a specialized foundation model for GI pathology. Our framework introduces a dual-phase iterative optimization strategy combining pretraining with fine-screening, specifically designed to address the detection of sparsely distributed lesion areas in whole-slide images. Digepath is pretrained on over 353 million multi-scale images from 210,043 H&E-stained slides of GI diseases. It attains state-of-the-art performance on 33 out of 34 tasks related to GI pathology, including pathological diagnosis, protein expression status prediction, gene mutation prediction, and prognosis evaluation. We further translate the intelligent screening module for early GI cancer and achieve near-perfect 99.70% sensitivity across nine independent medical institutions. This work not only advances AI-driven precision pathology for GI diseases but also bridge critical gaps in histopathological practice.

Title: ARiSE: Auto-Regressive Multi-Channel Speech Enhancement
Authors: Pengjie Shen, Xueliang Zhang, Zhong-Qiu Wang
Abstract: We propose ARiSE, an auto-regressive algorithm for multi-channel speech enhancement. ARiSE improves existing deep neural network (DNN) based frame-online multi-channel speech enhancement models by introducing auto-regressive connections, where the estimated target speech at previous frames is leveraged as extra input features to help the DNN estimate the target speech at the current frame. The extra input features can be derived from (a) the estimated target speech in previous frames; and (b) a beamformed mixture with the beamformer computed based on the previous estimated target speech. On the other hand, naively training the DNN in an auto-regressive manner is very slow. To deal with this, we propose a parallel training mechanism to speed up the training. Evaluation results in noisy-reverberant conditions show the effectiveness and potential of the proposed algorithms.

Title: Aspects of density approximation by tensor trains
Authors: Jiří Ajgl, Ondřej Straka
Abstract: Point-mass filters solve Bayesian recursive relations by approximating probability density functions of a system state over grids of discrete points. The approach suffers from the curse of dimensionality. The exponential increase of the number of the grid points can be mitigated by application of low-rank approximations of multidimensional arrays. Tensor train decompositions represent individual values by the product of matrices. This paper focuses on selected issues that are substantial in state estimation. Namely, the contamination of the density approximations by negative values is discussed first. Functional decompositions of quadratic functions are compared with decompositions of discretised Gaussian densities next. In particular, the connection of correlation with tensor train ranks is explored. Last, the consequences of interpolating the density values from one grid to a new grid are analysed.

Title: Quality Assessment of Noisy and Enhanced Speech with Limited Data: UWB-NTIS System for VoiceMOS 2024 and Beyond
Authors: Marie Kunešová
Abstract: In this preprint, we present the UWB-NTIS-TTS team's submission to Track 3 of the VoiceMOS 2024 Challenge, the goal of which was to automatically assess the speech quality of noisy and de-noised speech in terms of the ITU-T P.835 metrics of "SIG", "BAK", and "OVRL". Our proposed system, based on wav2vec 2.0, placed among the top systems in the challenge, achieving the best prediction of the BAK scores (background noise intrusiveness), the second-best prediction of the OVRL score (overall audio quality), and the third-best prediction of SIG (speech signal quality) out of the five participating systems. We describe our approach, such as the two-stage fine-tuning process we used to contend with the challenge's very limiting restrictions on allowable training data, and present the results achieved both on the VoiceMOS 2024 Challenge data and on the recently released CHiME 7 - UDASE dataset.

Title: Tightening Quadratic Convex Relaxations for the AC Optimal Transmission Switching Problem
Authors: Cheng Guo, Harsha Nagarajan, Merve Bodur
Abstract: The Alternating Current Optimal Transmission Switching (ACOTS) problem incorporates line switching decisions into the AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) framework, offering well-known benefits in reducing operational costs and enhancing system reliability. ACOTS optimization models contain discrete variables and nonlinear, non-convex constraints, which make it difficult to solve. In this work, we develop strengthened quadratic convex (QC) relaxations for ACOTS, where we tighten the relaxation with several new valid inequalities, including a novel kind of on/off cycle-based polynomial constraints by taking advantage of the network structure. We linearize the sum of on/off trilinear terms in the relaxation using extreme-point representation, demonstrating theoretical tightness, and efficiently incorporate on/off cycle-based polynomial constraints through disjunctive programming-based cutting planes. Combined with an optimization-based bound tightening algorithm, this results in the tightest QC-based ACOTS relaxation to date. We additionally propose a novel maximum spanning tree-based heuristic to improve the computational performance by fixing certain lines to be switched on. Our extensive numerical experiments on medium-scale PGLib instances show significant improvements on relaxation bounds, while tests on large-scale instances with up to 2,312 buses demonstrate substantial performance gains. To our knowledge, this is the first ACOTS relaxation-based approach to demonstrate near-optimal switching solutions on realistic large-scale power grid instances.

Title: The envelope of a complex Gaussian random variable
Authors: Sattwik Ghosal, Ranjan Maitra
Abstract: The envelope of an elliptical Gaussian complex vector, or equivalently, the amplitude or norm of a bivariate normal random vector has application in many weather and signal processing contexts. We explicitly characterize its distribution in the general case through its probability density, cumulative distribution and moment generating function. Moments and limiting distributions are also derived. These derivations are exploited to also characterize the special cases where the bivariate Gaussian mean vector and covariance matrix have a simpler structure, providing new additional insights in many cases. Simulations illustrate the benefits of using our formulae over Monte Carlo methods. We also use our derivations to get a better initial characterization of the distribution of the observed values in structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging datasets, and of wind speed.

Title: TMT: Tri-Modal Translation between Speech, Image, and Text by Processing Different Modalities as Different Languages
Authors: Minsu Kim, Jee-weon Jung, Hyeongseop Rha, Soumi Maiti, Siddhant Arora, Xuankai Chang, Shinji Watanabe, Yong Man Ro
Abstract: The capability to jointly process multi-modal information is becoming an essential task. However, the limited number of paired multi-modal data and the large computational requirements in multi-modal learning hinder the development. We propose a novel Tri-Modal Translation (TMT) model that translates between arbitrary modalities spanning speech, image, and text. We introduce a novel viewpoint, where we interpret different modalities as different languages, and treat multi-modal translation as a well-established machine translation problem. To this end, we tokenize speech and image data into discrete tokens, which provide a unified interface across modalities and significantly decrease the computational cost. In the proposed TMT, a multi-modal encoder-decoder conducts the core translation, whereas modality-specific processing is conducted only within the tokenization and detokenization stages. We evaluate the proposed TMT on all six modality translation tasks. TMT outperforms single model counterparts consistently, demonstrating that unifying tasks is beneficial not only for practicality but also for performance.

Title: Robust Control Lyapunov-Value Functions for Nonlinear Disturbed Systems
Authors: Zheng Gong, Sylvia Herbert
Abstract: Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) have been extensively used in the control community. A well-known drawback is the absence of a systematic way to construct CLFs for general nonlinear systems, and the problem can become more complex with input or state constraints. Our preliminary work on constructing Control Lyapunov Value Functions (CLVFs) using Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis provides a method for finding a non-smooth CLF. In this paper, we extend our work on CLVFs to systems with bounded disturbance and define the Robust CLVF (R-CLVF). The R-CLVF naturally inherits all properties of the CLVF; i.e., it first identifies the "smallest robust control invariant set (SRCIS)" and stabilizes the system to it with a user-specified exponential rate. The region from which the exponential rate can be met is called the "region of exponential stabilizability (ROES)." We provide clearer definitions of the SRCIS and more rigorous proofs of several important theorems. Since the computation of the R-CLVF suffers from the "curse of dimensionality," we also provide two techniques (warmstart and system decomposition) that solve it, along with necessary proofs. Three numerical examples are provided, validating our definition of SRCIS, illustrating the trade-off between a faster decay rate and a smaller ROES, and demonstrating the efficiency of computation using warmstart and decomposition.

Title: WER We Stand: Benchmarking Urdu ASR Models
Authors: Samee Arif, Sualeha Farid, Aamina Jamal Khan, Mustafa Abbas, Agha Ali Raza, Awais Athar
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of Urdu Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models. We analyze the performance of three ASR model families: Whisper, MMS, and Seamless-M4T using Word Error Rate (WER), along with a detailed examination of the most frequent wrong words and error types including insertions, deletions, and substitutions. Our analysis is conducted using two types of datasets, read speech and conversational speech. Notably, we present the first conversational speech dataset designed for benchmarking Urdu ASR models. We find that seamless-large outperforms other ASR models on the read speech dataset, while whisper-large performs best on the conversational speech dataset. Furthermore, this evaluation highlights the complexities of assessing ASR models for low-resource languages like Urdu using quantitative metrics alone and emphasizes the need for a robust Urdu text normalization system. Our findings contribute valuable insights for developing robust ASR systems for low-resource languages like Urdu.

Title: Optimization Proxies using Limited Labeled Data and Training Time -- A Semi-Supervised Bayesian Neural Network Approach
Authors: Parikshit Pareek, Abhijith Jayakumar, Kaarthik Sundar, Deepjyoti Deka, Sidhant Misra
Abstract: Constrained optimization problems arise in various engineering systems such as inventory management and power grids. Standard deep neural network (DNN) based machine learning proxies are ineffective in practical settings where labeled data is scarce and training times are limited. We propose a semi-supervised Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) based optimization proxy for this complex regime, wherein training commences in a sandwiched fashion, alternating between a supervised learning step for minimizing cost, and an unsupervised learning step for enforcing constraint feasibility. We show that the proposed semi-supervised BNN outperforms DNN architectures on important non-convex constrained optimization problems from energy network operations, achieving up to a tenfold reduction in expected maximum equality gap and halving the inequality gaps. Further, the BNN's ability to provide posterior samples is leveraged to construct practically meaningful probabilistic confidence bounds on performance using a limited validation data, unlike prior methods.

Title: Efficient Fine-Grained Guidance for Diffusion Model Based Symbolic Music Generation
Authors: Tingyu Zhu, Haoyu Liu, Ziyu Wang, Zhimin Jiang, Zeyu Zheng
Abstract: Developing generative models to create or conditionally create symbolic music presents unique challenges due to the combination of limited data availability and the need for high precision in note pitch. To address these challenges, we introduce an efficient Fine-Grained Guidance (FGG) approach within diffusion models. FGG guides the diffusion models to generate music that aligns more closely with the control and intent of expert composers, which is critical to improve the accuracy, listenability, and quality of generated music. This approach empowers diffusion models to excel in advanced applications such as improvisation, and interactive music creation. We derive theoretical characterizations for both the challenges in symbolic music generation and the effects of the FGG approach. We provide numerical experiments and subjective evaluation to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We have published a demo page to showcase performances, which enables real-time interactive generation.

Title: SGD Jittering: A Training Strategy for Robust and Accurate Model-Based Architectures
Authors: Peimeng Guan, Mark A. Davenport
Abstract: Inverse problems aim to reconstruct unseen data from corrupted or perturbed measurements. While most work focuses on improving reconstruction quality, generalization accuracy and robustness are equally important, especially for safety-critical applications. Model-based architectures (MBAs), such as loop unrolling methods, are considered more interpretable and achieve better reconstructions. Empirical evidence suggests that MBAs are more robust to perturbations than black-box solvers, but the accuracy-robustness tradeoff in MBAs remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective training scheme for MBAs, called SGD jittering, which injects noise iteration-wise during reconstruction. We theoretically demonstrate that SGD jittering not only generalizes better than the standard mean squared error training but is also more robust to average-case attacks. We validate SGD jittering using denoising toy examples, seismic deconvolution, and single-coil MRI reconstruction. Both SGD jittering and its SPGD extension yield cleaner reconstructions for out-of-distribution data and demonstrates enhanced robustness against adversarial attacks.

Title: Enhancing pretraining efficiency for medical image segmentation via transferability metrics
Authors: Gábor Hidy, Bence Bakos, András Lukács
Abstract: In medical image segmentation tasks, the scarcity of labeled training data poses a significant challenge when training deep neural networks. When using U-Net-style architectures, it is common practice to address this problem by pretraining the encoder part on a large general-purpose dataset like ImageNet. However, these methods are resource-intensive and do not guarantee improved performance on the downstream task. In this paper we investigate a variety of training setups on medical image segmentation datasets, using ImageNet-pretrained models. By examining over 300 combinations of models, datasets, and training methods, we find that shorter pretraining often leads to better results on the downstream task, providing additional proof to the well-known fact that the accuracy of the model on ImageNet is a poor indicator for downstream performance. As our main contribution, we introduce a novel transferability metric, based on contrastive learning, that measures how robustly a pretrained model is able to represent the target data. In contrast to other transferability scores, our method is applicable to the case of transferring from ImageNet classification to medical image segmentation. We apply our robustness score by measuring it throughout the pretraining phase to indicate when the model weights are optimal for downstream transfer. This reduces pretraining time and improves results on the target task.

Title: Who Can Withstand Chat-Audio Attacks? An Evaluation Benchmark for Large Audio-Language Models
Authors: Wanqi Yang, Yanda Li, Meng Fang, Yunchao Wei, Ling Chen
Abstract: Adversarial audio attacks pose a significant threat to the growing use of large audio-language models (LALMs) in voice-based human-machine interactions. While existing research focused on model-specific adversarial methods, real-world applications demand a more generalizable and universal approach to audio adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce the Chat-Audio Attacks (CAA) benchmark including four distinct types of audio attacks, which aims to explore the vulnerabilities of LALMs to these audio attacks in conversational scenarios. To evaluate the robustness of LALMs, we propose three evaluation strategies: Standard Evaluation, utilizing traditional metrics to quantify model performance under attacks; GPT-4o-Based Evaluation, which simulates real-world conversational complexities; and Human Evaluation, offering insights into user perception and trust. We evaluate six state-of-the-art LALMs with voice interaction capabilities, including Gemini-1.5-Pro, GPT-4o, and others, using three distinct evaluation methods on the CAA benchmark. Our comprehensive analysis reveals the impact of four types of audio attacks on the performance of these models, demonstrating that GPT-4o exhibits the highest level of resilience.

Abstract: Determining whether two sets of images belong to the same or different distributions or domains is a crucial task in modern medical image analysis and deep learning; for example, to evaluate the output quality of image generative models. Currently, metrics used for this task either rely on the (potentially biased) choice of some downstream task, such as segmentation, or adopt task-independent perceptual metrics (e.g., Fréchet Inception Distance/FID) from natural imaging, which we show insufficiently capture anatomical features. To this end, we introduce a new perceptual metric tailored for medical images, FRD (Fréchet Radiomic Distance), which utilizes standardized, clinically meaningful, and interpretable image features. We show that FRD is superior to other image distribution metrics for a range of medical imaging applications, including out-of-domain (OOD) detection, the evaluation of image-to-image translation (by correlating more with downstream task performance as well as anatomical consistency and realism), and the evaluation of unconditional image generation. Moreover, FRD offers additional benefits such as stability and computational efficiency at low sample sizes, sensitivity to image corruptions and adversarial attacks, feature interpretability, and correlation with radiologist-perceived image quality. Additionally, we address key gaps in the literature by presenting an extensive framework for the multifaceted evaluation of image similarity metrics in medical imaging -- including the first large-scale comparative study of generative models for medical image translation -- and release an accessible codebase to facilitate future research. Our results are supported by thorough experiments spanning a variety of datasets, modalities, and downstream tasks, highlighting the broad potential of FRD for medical image analysis.

Title: A Riemannian Optimization Perspective of the Gauss-Newton Method for Feedforward Neural Networks
Authors: Semih Cayci
Abstract: We analyze the convergence of Gauss-Newton dynamics for training neural networks with smooth activation functions. In the underparameterized regime, the Gauss-Newton gradient flow induces a Riemannian gradient flow on a low-dimensional, smooth, embedded submanifold of the Euclidean output space. Using tools from Riemannian optimization, we prove \emph{last-iterate} convergence of the Riemannian gradient flow to the optimal in-class predictor at an \emph{exponential rate} that is independent of the conditioning of the Gram matrix, \emph{without} requiring explicit regularization. We further characterize the critical impacts of the neural network scaling factor and the initialization on the convergence behavior. In the overparameterized regime, we show that the Levenberg-Marquardt dynamics with an appropriately chosen damping schedule yields fast convergence rate despite potentially ill-conditioned neural tangent kernel matrices, analogous to the underparameterized regime. These findings demonstrate the potential of Gauss-Newton methods for efficiently optimizing neural networks in the near-initialization regime, particularly in ill-conditioned problems where kernel and Gram matrices have small singular values.

Title: Toward a Low-Cost Perception System in Autonomous Vehicles: A Spectrum Learning Approach
Authors: Mohammed Alsakabi, Aidan Erickson, John M. Dolan, Ozan K. Tonguz
Abstract: We present a cost-effective new approach for generating denser depth maps for Autonomous Driving (AD) and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) by integrating the images obtained from deep neural network (DNN) 4D radar detectors with conventional camera RGB images. Our approach introduces a novel pixel positional encoding algorithm inspired by Bartlett's spatial spectrum estimation technique. This algorithm transforms both radar depth maps and RGB images into a unified pixel image subspace called the Spatial Spectrum, facilitating effective learning based on their similarities and differences. Our method effectively leverages high-resolution camera images to train radar depth map generative models, addressing the limitations of conventional radar detectors in complex vehicular environments, thus sharpening the radar output. We develop spectrum estimation algorithms tailored for radar depth maps and RGB images, a comprehensive training framework for data-driven generative models, and a camera-radar deployment scheme for AV operation. Our results demonstrate that our approach also outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 27.95% in terms of Unidirectional Chamfer Distance (UCD).

Title: UniDB: A Unified Diffusion Bridge Framework via Stochastic Optimal Control
Authors: Kaizhen Zhu, Mokai Pan, Yuexin Ma, Yanwei Fu, Jingyi Yu, Jingya Wang, Ye Shi
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion bridge models leverage Doob's $h$-transform to establish fixed endpoints between distributions, demonstrating promising results in image translation and restoration tasks. However, these approaches frequently produce blurred or excessively smoothed image details and lack a comprehensive theoretical foundation to explain these shortcomings. To address these limitations, we propose UniDB, a unified framework for diffusion bridges based on Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC). UniDB formulates the problem through an SOC-based optimization and derives a closed-form solution for the optimal controller, thereby unifying and generalizing existing diffusion bridge models. We demonstrate that existing diffusion bridges employing Doob's $h$-transform constitute a special case of our framework, emerging when the terminal penalty coefficient in the SOC cost function tends to infinity. By incorporating a tunable terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves an optimal balance between control costs and terminal penalties, substantially improving detail preservation and output quality. Notably, UniDB seamlessly integrates with existing diffusion bridge models, requiring only minimal code modifications. Extensive experiments across diverse image restoration tasks validate the superiority and adaptability of the proposed framework. Our code is available at this https URL.

Title: DualSpec: Text-to-spatial-audio Generation via Dual-Spectrogram Guided Diffusion Model
Authors: Lei Zhao, Sizhou Chen, Linfeng Feng, Jichao Zhang, Xiao-Lei Zhang, Chi Zhang, Xuelong Li
Abstract: Text-to-audio (TTA), which generates audio signals from textual descriptions, has received huge attention in recent years. However, recent works focused on text to monaural audio only. As we know, spatial audio provides more immersive auditory experience than monaural audio, e.g. in virtual reality. To address this issue, we propose a text-to-spatial-audio (TTSA) generation framework named DualSpec. Specifically, it first trains variational autoencoders (VAEs) for extracting the latent acoustic representations from sound event audio. Then, given text that describes sound events and event directions, the proposed method uses the encoder of a pretrained large language model to transform the text into text features. Finally, it trains a diffusion model from the latent acoustic representations and text features for the spatial audio generation. In the inference stage, only the text description is needed to generate spatial audio. Particularly, to improve the synthesis quality and azimuth accuracy of the spatial sound events simultaneously, we propose to use two kinds of acoustic features. One is the Mel spectrograms which is good for improving the synthesis quality, and the other is the short-time Fourier transform spectrograms which is good at improving the azimuth accuracy. We provide a pipeline of constructing spatial audio dataset with text prompts, for the training of the VAEs and diffusion model. We also introduce new spatial-aware evaluation metrics to quantify the azimuth errors of the generated spatial audio recordings. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can generate spatial audio with high directional and event consistency.

Title: SafeAuto: Knowledge-Enhanced Safe Autonomous Driving with Multimodal Foundation Models
Authors: Jiawei Zhang, Xuan Yang, Taiqi Wang, Yu Yao, Aleksandr Petiushko, Bo Li
Abstract: Traditional autonomous driving systems often struggle to connect high-level reasoning with low-level control, leading to suboptimal and sometimes unsafe behaviors. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which process both visual and textual data, offer an opportunity to unify perception and reasoning. However, effectively embedding precise safety knowledge into MLLMs for autonomous driving remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose SafeAuto, a framework that enhances MLLM-based autonomous driving by incorporating both unstructured and structured knowledge. First, we introduce a Position-Dependent Cross-Entropy (PDCE) loss to improve low-level control signal predictions when values are represented as text. Second, to explicitly integrate safety knowledge, we develop a reasoning component that translates traffic rules into first-order logic (e.g., "red light $\implies$ stop") and embeds them into a probabilistic graphical model (e.g., Markov Logic Network) to verify predicted actions using recognized environmental attributes. Additionally, our Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model leverages video, control signals, and environmental attributes to learn from past driving experiences. Integrating PDCE, MLN, and Multimodal RAG, SafeAuto outperforms existing baselines across multiple datasets, enabling more accurate, reliable, and safer autonomous driving. The code is available at this https URL.

Title: Uncertainty Propagation in the Fast Fourier Transform
Authors: Luca Schmid, Charlotte Muth, Laurent Schmalen
Abstract: We address the problem of uncertainty propagation in the discrete Fourier transform by modeling the fast Fourier transform as a factor graph. Building on this representation, we propose an efficient framework for approximate Bayesian inference using belief propagation (BP) and expectation propagation, extending its applicability beyond Gaussian assumptions. By leveraging an appropriate BP message representation and a suitable schedule, our method achieves stable convergence with accurate mean and variance estimates. Numerical experiments in representative scenarios from communications demonstrate the practical potential of the proposed framework for uncertainty-aware inference in probabilistic systems operating across both time and frequency domain.

Title: Can Masked Autoencoders Also Listen to Birds?
Authors: Lukas Rauch, René Heinrich, Ilyass Moummad, Alexis Joly, Bernhard Sick, Christoph Scholz
Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have shown competitive results in audio classification by learning rich semantic representations through an efficient self-supervised reconstruction task. However, general-purpose models fail to generalize well when applied directly to fine-grained audio domains. Specifically, bird-sound classification requires distinguishing subtle inter-species differences and managing high intra-species acoustic variability, thereby revealing the performance limitations of general-domain Audio-MAE models. This work demonstrates that bridging this domain gap requires more than domain-specific pretraining data; adapting the entire training pipeline is crucial. We systematically revisit and adapt the pretraining recipe, fine-tuning methods, and frozen feature utilization to bird sounds using BirdSet, a large-scale bioacoustic dataset comparable to AudioSet. Our resulting Bird-MAE achieves new state-of-the-art results in BirdSet's multi-label classification benchmark. Additionally, we introduce the parameter-efficient prototypical probing, enhancing the utility of frozen MAE representations and closely approaching fine-tuning performance in low-resource settings. Bird-MAE's prototypical probes outperform linear probing by up to 37%$_\text{p}$ in MAP and narrow the gap to fine-tuning to approximately 3.3%$_\text{p}$ on average across BirdSet downstream tasks. Bird-MAE also demonstrates robust few-shot capabilities with prototypical probing in our newly established few-shot benchmark on BirdSet, highlighting the potential of tailored self-supervised learning pipelines for fine-grained audio domains.

Title: Advancing Zero-shot Text-to-Speech Intelligibility across Diverse Domains via Preference Alignment
Authors: Xueyao Zhang, Yuancheng Wang, Chaoren Wang, Ziniu Li, Zhuo Chen, Zhizheng Wu
Abstract: Modern zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) systems, despite using extensive pre-training, often struggle in challenging scenarios such as tongue twisters, repeated words, code-switching, and cross-lingual synthesis, leading to intelligibility issues. To address these limitations, this paper leverages preference alignment techniques, which enable targeted construction of out-of-pretraining-distribution data to enhance performance. We introduce a new dataset, named the Intelligibility Preference Speech Dataset (INTP), and extend the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) framework to accommodate diverse TTS architectures. After INTP alignment, in addition to intelligibility, we observe overall improvements including naturalness, similarity, and audio quality for multiple TTS models across diverse domains. Based on that, we also verify the weak-to-strong generalization ability of INTP for more intelligible models such as CosyVoice 2 and Ints. Moreover, we showcase the potential for further improvements through iterative alignment based on Ints. Audio samples are available at this https URL.

Title: Efficient and Direct Duplex Modeling for Speech-to-Speech Language Model
Authors: Ke Hu, Ehsan Hosseini-Asl, Chen Chen, Edresson Casanova, Subhankar Ghosh, Piotr Żelasko, Zhehuai Chen, Jason Li, Jagadeesh Balam, Boris Ginsburg
Abstract: Spoken dialogue is an intuitive form of human-computer interaction, yet current speech language models often remain constrained to turn-based exchanges, lacking real-time adaptability such as user barge-in. We propose a novel duplex speech to speech (S2S) architecture featuring continuous user inputs and codec agent outputs with channel fusion that directly models simultaneous user and agent streams. Using a pretrained streaming encoder for user input enables the first duplex S2S model without requiring speech pretrain. Separate architectures for agent and user modeling facilitate codec fine-tuning for better agent voices and halve the bitrate (0.6 kbps) compared to previous works. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms previous duplex models in reasoning, turn-taking, and barge-in abilities. The model requires significantly less speech data, as speech pretrain is skipped, which markedly simplifies the process of building a duplex S2S model from any LLMs. Finally, it is the first openly available duplex S2S model with training and inference code to foster reproducibility.

Title: Multi-Channel Acoustic Echo Cancellation Based on Direction-of-Arrival Estimation
Authors: Fei Zhao, Xueliang Zhang, Zhong-Qiu Wang
Abstract: Acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) is an important speech signal processing technology that can remove echoes from microphone signals to enable natural-sounding full-duplex speech communication. While single-channel AEC is widely adopted, multi-channel AEC can leverage spatial cues afforded by multiple microphones to achieve better performance. Existing multi-channel AEC approaches typically combine beamforming with deep neural networks (DNN). This work proposes a two-stage algorithm that enhances multi-channel AEC by incorporating sound source directional cues. Specifically, a lightweight DNN is first trained to predict the sound source directions, and then the predicted directional information, multi-channel microphone signals, and single-channel far-end signal are jointly fed into an AEC network to estimate the near-end signal. Evaluation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms baseline approaches and exhibits robust generalization across diverse acoustic environments.

Title: Application of convolutional neural networks in image super-resolution
Authors: Chunwei Tian, Mingjian Song, Wangmeng Zuo, Bo Du, Yanning Zhang, Shichao Zhang
Abstract: Due to strong learning abilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), they have become mainstream methods for image super-resolution. However, there are big differences of different deep learning methods with different types. There is little literature to summarize relations and differences of different methods in image super-resolution. Thus, summarizing these literatures are important, according to loading capacity and execution speed of devices. This paper first introduces principles of CNNs in image super-resolution, then introduces CNNs based bicubic interpolation, nearest neighbor interpolation, bilinear interpolation, transposed convolution, sub-pixel layer, meta up-sampling for image super-resolution to analyze differences and relations of different CNNs based interpolations and modules, and compare performance of these methods by experiments. Finally, this paper gives potential research points and drawbacks and summarizes the whole paper, which can facilitate developments of CNNs in image super-resolution.

Title: MARS: Radio Map Super-resolution and Reconstruction Method under Sparse Channel Measurements
Authors: Chuyun Deng, Na Liu, Wei Xie, Lianming Xu, Li Wang
Abstract: Radio maps reflect the spatial distribution of signal strength and are essential for applications like smart cities, IoT, and wireless network planning. However, reconstructing accurate radio maps from sparse measurements remains challenging. Traditional interpolation and inpainting methods lack environmental awareness, while many deep learning approaches depend on detailed scene data, limiting generalization. To address this, we propose MARS, a Multi-scale Aware Radiomap Super-resolution method that combines CNNs and Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections. MARS focuses on both global and local feature extraction, enhancing feature representation across different receptive fields and improving reconstruction accuracy. Experiments across different scenes and antenna locations show that MARS outperforms baseline models in both MSE and SSIM, while maintaining low computational cost, demonstrating strong practical potential.
