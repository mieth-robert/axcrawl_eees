Title: IntelliCardiac: An Intelligent Platform for Cardiac Image Segmentation and Classification
Authors: Ting Yu Tsai, An Yu, Meghana Spurthi Maadugundu, Ishrat Jahan Mohima, Umme Habiba Barsha, Mei-Hwa F. Chen, Balakrishnan Prabhakaran, Ming-Ching Chang
Abstract: Precise and effective processing of cardiac imaging data is critical for the identification and management of the cardiovascular diseases. We introduce IntelliCardiac, a comprehensive, web-based medical image processing platform for the automatic segmentation of 4D cardiac images and disease classification, utilizing an AI model trained on the publicly accessible ACDC dataset. The system, intended for patients, cardiologists, and healthcare professionals, offers an intuitive interface and uses deep learning models to identify essential heart structures and categorize cardiac diseases. The system supports analysis of both the right and left ventricles as well as myocardium, and then classifies patient's cardiac images into five diagnostic categories: dilated cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, right ventricular abnormality, and no disease. IntelliCardiac combines a deep learning-based segmentation model with a two-step classification pipeline. The segmentation module gains an overall accuracy of 92.6\%. The classification module, trained on characteristics taken from segmented heart structures, achieves 98\% accuracy in five categories. These results exceed the performance of the existing state-of-the-art methods that integrate both segmentation and classification models. IntelliCardiac, which supports real-time visualization, workflow integration, and AI-assisted diagnostics, has great potential as a scalable, accurate tool for clinical decision assistance in cardiac imaging and diagnosis.

Title: From Spaceborn to Airborn: SAR Image Synthesis Using Foundation Models for Multi-Scale Adaptation
Authors: Solène Debuysère, Nicolas Trouvé, Nathan Letheule, Olivier Lévêque, Elise Colin
Abstract: The availability of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery has increased considerably in recent years, with datasets commercially available. However, the acquisition of high-resolution SAR images in airborne configurations, remains costly and limited. Thus, the lack of open source, well-labeled, or easily exploitable SAR text-image datasets is a barrier to the use of existing foundation models in remote sensing applications. In this context, synthetic image generation is a promising solution to augment this scarce data, enabling a broader range of applications. Leveraging over 15 years of ONERA's extensive archival airborn data from acquisition campaigns, we created a comprehensive training dataset of 110 thousands SAR images to exploit a 3.5 billion parameters pre-trained latent diffusion model. In this work, we present a novel approach utilizing spatial conditioning techniques within a foundation model to transform satellite SAR imagery into airborne SAR representations. Additionally, we demonstrate that our pipeline is effective for bridging the realism of simulated images generated by ONERA's physics-based simulator EMPRISE. Our method explores a key application of AI in advancing SAR imaging technology. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce this approach in the literature.

Authors: Ioannis Kyprakis, Vasileios Skaramagkas, Iro Boura, Georgios Karamanis, Dimitrios I. Fotiadis, Zinovia Kefalopoulou, Cleanthe Spanaki, Manolis Tsiknakis
Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, manifesting with motor and non-motor symptoms. Depressive symptoms are prevalent in PD, affecting up to 45% of patients. They are often underdiagnosed due to overlapping motor features, such as hypomimia. This study explores deep learning (DL) models-ViViT, Video Swin Tiny, and 3D CNN-LSTM with attention layers-to assess the presence and severity of depressive symptoms, as detected by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), in PD patients through facial video analysis. The same parameters were assessed in a secondary analysis taking into account whether patients were one hour after (ON-medication state) or 12 hours without (OFF-medication state) dopaminergic medication. Using a dataset of 1,875 videos from 178 patients, the Video Swin Tiny model achieved the highest performance, with up to 94% accuracy and 93.7% F1-score in binary classification (presence of absence of depressive symptoms), and 87.1% accuracy with an 85.4% F1-score in multiclass tasks (absence or mild or severe depressive symptoms).

Title: Prototype-Based Information Compensation Network for Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data Classification
Authors: Feng Gao, Sheng Liu, Chuanzheng Gong, Xiaowei Zhou, Jiayi Wang, Junyu Dong, Qian Du
Abstract: Multi-source remote sensing data joint classification aims to provide accuracy and reliability of land cover classification by leveraging the complementary information from multiple data sources. Existing methods confront two challenges: inter-frequency multi-source feature coupling and inconsistency of complementary information exploration. To solve these issues, we present a Prototype-based Information Compensation Network (PICNet) for land cover classification based on HSI and SAR/LiDAR data. Specifically, we first design a frequency interaction module to enhance the inter-frequency coupling in multi-source feature extraction. The multi-source features are first decoupled into high- and low-frequency components. Then, these features are recoupled to achieve efficient inter-frequency communication. Afterward, we design a prototype-based information compensation module to model the global multi-source complementary information. Two sets of learnable modality prototypes are introduced to represent the global modality information of multi-source data. Subsequently, cross-modal feature integration and alignment are achieved through cross-attention computation between the modality-specific prototype vectors and the raw feature representations. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the significant superiority of our PICNet over state-of-the-art methods. The codes are available at this https URL.

Title: Aliasing Reduction in Neural Amp Modeling by Smoothing Activations
Authors: Ryota Sato, Julius O. Smith III
Abstract: The increasing demand for high-quality digital emulations of analog audio hardware such as vintage guitar amplifiers has led to numerous works in neural-network-based black-box modeling, with deep learning architectures like WaveNet showing promising results. However, a key limitation in all of these models is the aliasing artifacts that arise from the use of nonlinear activation functions in neural networks. In this paper, we investigate novel and modified activation functions aimed at mitigating aliasing within neural amplifier models. Supporting this, we introduce a novel metric, the Aliasing-to-Signal Ratio (ASR), which quantitatively assesses the level of aliasing with high accuracy. Measuring also the conventional Error-to-Signal Ratio (ESR), we conducted studies on a range of preexisting and modern activation functions with varying stretch factors. Our findings confirmed that activation functions with smoother curves tend to achieve lower ASR values, indicating a noticeable reduction in aliasing. Notably, this improvement in aliasing reduction was achievable without a substantial increase in ESR, demonstrating the potential for high modeling accuracy with reduced aliasing in neural amp models.

Title: Device-Free Localization Using Multi-Link MIMO Channels in Distributed Antenna Networks
Authors: Minseok Kim, Gesi Teng, Keita Nishi, Togo Ikegami, Masamune Sato
Abstract: This paper presented a novel device-free localization (DFL) framework based on distributed antenna networks (DANs), targeting integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in future 6G radio access networks (RANs). In the proposed approach, radio tomographic imaging (RTI) leverages the spatial and temporal diversity of multi-link multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels in DANs to improve localization accuracy. Furthermore, a prototype system was developed using software-defined radios (SDRs) operating in the sub-6 GHz band, and comprehensive evaluations were conducted under indoor conditions involving varying node densities and target types. The results demonstrate that the framework achieves sub-meter localization accuracy in most scenarios and maintains robust performance under complex multipath environments. In addition, the use of Bayesian optimization to fine-tune key parameters, such as sparsity and path thickness, led to significant improvements in image reconstruction quality and target estimation accuracy. These results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of DAN-based DFL systems for accurate, robust, and scalable localization.

Title: 3D Brain MRI Classification for Alzheimer Diagnosis Using CNN with Data Augmentation
Authors: Thien Nhan Vo, Bac Nam Ho, Thanh Xuan Truong
Abstract: A three-dimensional convolutional neural network was developed to classify T1-weighted brain MRI scans as healthy or Alzheimer. The network comprises 3D convolution, pooling, batch normalization, dense ReLU layers, and a sigmoid output. Using stochastic noise injection and five-fold cross-validation, the model achieved test set accuracy of 0.912 and area under the ROC curve of 0.961, an improvement of approximately 0.027 over resizing alone. Sensitivity and specificity both exceeded 0.90. These results align with prior work reporting up to 0.10 gain via synthetic augmentation. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of simple augmentation for 3D MRI classification and motivate future exploration of advanced augmentation methods and architectures such as 3D U-Net and vision transformers.

Title: UX-aware Rate Allocation for Real-Time Media
Authors: Belal Korany, Peerapol Tinnakornsrisuphap, Saadallah Kassir, Prashanth Hande, Hyun Yong Lee, Thomas Stockhammer
Abstract: Immersive communications is a key use case for 6G where applications require reliable latency-bound media traffic at a certain data rate to deliver an acceptable User Experience (UX) or Quality-of-Experience (QoE). The Quality-of-Service (QoS) framework of current cellular systems (4G and 5G) and prevalent network congestion control algorithms for latency-bound traffic like L4S typically target network-related Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as data rates and latencies. Network capacity is based on the number of users that attain these KPIs. However, the UX of an immersive application for a given data rate and latency is not the same across users, since it depends on other factors such as the complexity of the media being transmitted and the encoder format. This implies that guarantees on network KPIs do not necessarily translate to guarantees on the UX. In this paper, we propose a framework in which the communication network can provide guarantees on the UX. The framework requires application servers to share real-time information on UX dependency on data rate to the network, which in turn, uses this information to maximize a UX-based network utility function. Our framework is motivated by the recent industry trends of increasing application awareness at the network, and pushing application servers towards the edge, allowing for tighter coordination between the servers and the 6G system. Our simulation results show that the proposed framework substantially improves the UX capacity of the network, which is the number of users above a certain UX threshold, compared to conventional rate control algorithms.

Title: Scalable 49-Channel Neural Recorder with an Event-Driven Ramp ADC and PCA Compression in 28 nm CMOS
Authors: William Lemaire, Esmaeil Ranjbar Koleibi, Maher Benhouria, Konin Koua, Jérémy Ménard, Keven Gagnon, Charles Quesnel, Louis-Philippe Gauthier, Takwa Omrani, Montassar Dridi, Mahdi Majdoub, Marwan Besrour, Sébastien Roy, Réjean Fontaine
Abstract: Neural interfaces advance neuroscience research and therapeutic innovations by accurately measuring neuronal activity. However, recording raw data from numerous neurons results in substantial amount of data and poses challenges for wireless transmission. While conventional neural recorders consume energy to digitize and process the full neural signal, only a fraction of this data carries essential spiking information. Leveraging on this signal sparsity, this paper introduces a neural recording integrated circuit in TSMC 28nm CMOS. It features an event-driven ramp analog-to-digital converter, and a spike compression module based on principal component analysis. The circuit consists of 49 channels, each occupying an on-chip area of 50 $\times$ 60 $\mu$m$^2$. The circuit measures 1370 $\times$ 1370 $\mu$m$^2$ and consumes 534 $\mu$W. Compression testing on a synthetic dataset demonstrated an 8.8-fold reduction compared to raw spikes and a 328-fold reduction relative to the raw signal. This compression approach maintained a spike sorting accuracy of 74.9%, compared to the 79.5% accuracy obtained with the raw signal. The paper details the architecture and performance outcomes of the neural recording circuit and its compression module.

Title: Energy Efficient RSMA-Based LEO Satellite Communications Assisted by UAV-Mounted BD-Active RIS: A DRL Approach
Authors: Rahman Saadat Yeganeh, Hamid Behroozi
Abstract: This paper proposes an advanced non-terrestrial communication architecture that integrates Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) with a Beyond-Diagonal Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (BD-ARIS) mounted on a UAV under the coverage of a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite. The BD-ARIS adopts a group-connected structure to enhance signal amplification and adaptability, while RSMA enables efficient multi-user access by dividing messages into common and private components. The system jointly optimizes satellite beamforming, UAV positioning, power allocation, and rate-splitting ratios to maximize the overall energy efficiency (EE). To solve the resulting non-convex and high-dimensional problem, we employ three state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms: Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3), and Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C). Moreover, realistic models for the power consumption of both the UAV and the BD-ARIS are considered. Simulation results reveal that TRPO consistently achieves the best performance in terms of EE and sum rate, especially under high transmit powers and challenging deployment scenarios. TD3 converges faster and performs competitively in moderate settings, while A3C suffers from instability due to its high variance. Additionally, the robustness of each algorithm under channel state information (CSI) uncertainty is evaluated, confirming TRPO resilience to imperfect observations. Overall, the proposed RSMA-BD-ARIS framework significantly outperforms conventional RIS-assisted designs and provides a scalable, energy-efficient solution for 6G and massive IoT applications in non-terrestrial networks.

Title: A Dataset and Toolkit for Multiparameter Cardiovascular Physiology Sensing on Rings
Authors: Iankai Tang, Kegang Wang, Yingke Ding, Jiatong Ji, Zeyu Wang, Xiyuxing Zhang, Ping Chen, Yuanchun Shi, Yuntao Wang
Abstract: Smart rings offer a convenient way to continuously and unobtrusively monitor cardiovascular physiological signals. However, a gap remains between the ring hardware and reliable methods for estimating cardiovascular parameters, partly due to the lack of publicly available datasets and standardized analysis tools. In this work, we present $\tau$-Ring, the first open-source ring-based dataset designed for cardiovascular physiological sensing. The dataset comprises photoplethysmography signals (infrared and red channels) and 3-axis accelerometer data collected from two rings (reflective and transmissive optical paths), with 28.21 hours of raw data from 34 subjects across seven activities. $\tau$-Ring encompasses both stationary and motion scenarios, as well as stimulus-evoked abnormal physiological states, annotated with four ground-truth labels: heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure. Using our proposed RingTool toolkit, we evaluated three widely-used physics-based methods and four cutting-edge deep learning approaches. Our results show superior performance compared to commercial rings, achieving best MAE values of 5.18 BPM for heart rate, 2.98 BPM for respiratory rate, 3.22\% for oxygen saturation, and 13.33/7.56 mmHg for systolic/diastolic blood pressure estimation. The open-sourced dataset and toolkit aim to foster further research and community-driven advances in ring-based cardiovascular health sensing.

Title: Impact of Grid-Forming Inverters on Protective Relays: A Perspective for Current Limiting Control Design
Authors: Yifei Li, Heng Wu, Xiongfei Wang
Abstract: Grid-forming (GFM) inverters can significantly alter the fault characteristics of power systems, which challenges the proper function of protective relays. This paper gives a holistic analysis of the interaction between GFM inverter-based resources (IBRs) and the supervising elements in protective relays, including directional and phase selection elements. It is revealed that the current limiting control (CLC) that is based on the current reference saturation method, adversely affects the performance of supervising elements that rely on the negative-sequence quantities. In contrast, adopting highly inductive virtual impedance in the CLC enables a reliable operation of such elements. This finding provides insights into the design of CLC for GFM IBRs from a protection perspective. It is further found that even with a highly inductive virtual impedance, the altered virtual impedance dynamics introduced by the CLC can still lead to malfunctions of the incremental quantity-based supervising elements. These theoretical findings are corroborated by simulations and controller hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) tests.

Title: The stability of generalized phase retrieval problem over compact groups
Authors: Tal Amir, Tamir Bendory, Nadav Dym, Dan Edidin
Abstract: The generalized phase retrieval problem over compact groups aims to recover a set of matrices, representing an unknown signal, from their associated Gram matrices, leveraging prior structural knowledge about the signal. This framework generalizes the classical phase retrieval problem, which reconstructs a signal from the magnitudes of its Fourier transform, to a richer setting involving non-abelian compact groups. In this broader context, the unknown phases in Fourier space are replaced by unknown orthogonal matrices that arise from the action of a compact group on a finite-dimensional vector space. This problem is primarily motivated by advances in electron microscopy to determining the 3D structure of biological macromolecules from highly noisy observations. To capture realistic assumptions from machine learning and signal processing, we model the signal as belonging to one of several broad structural families: a generic linear subspace, a sparse representation in a generic basis, the output of a generic ReLU neural network, or a generic low-dimensional manifold. Our main result shows that, under mild conditions, the generalized phase retrieval problem not only admits a unique solution (up to inherent group symmetries), but also satisfies a bi-Lipschitz property. This implies robustness to both noise and model mismatch, an essential requirement for practical use, especially when measurements are severely corrupted by noise. These findings provide theoretical support for a wide class of scientific problems under modern structural assumptions, and they offer strong foundations for developing robust algorithms in high-noise regimes.

Title: Enhanced SCanNet with CBAM and Dice Loss for Semantic Change Detection
Authors: Athulya Ratnayake, Buddhi Wijenayake, Praveen Sumanasekara, Roshan Godaliyadda, Vijitha Herath, Parakrama Ekanayake
Abstract: Semantic Change Detection (SCD) in remote sensing imagery requires accurately identifying land-cover changes across multi-temporal image pairs. Despite substantial advancements, including the introduction of transformer-based architectures, current SCD models continue to struggle with challenges such as noisy inputs, subtle class boundaries, and significant class imbalance. In this study, we propose enhancing the Semantic Change Network (SCanNet) by integrating the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and employing Dice loss during training. CBAM sequentially applies channel attention to highlight feature maps with the most meaningful content, followed by spatial attention to pinpoint critical regions within these maps. This sequential approach ensures precise suppression of irrelevant features and spatial noise, resulting in more accurate and robust detection performance compared to attention mechanisms that apply both processes simultaneously or independently. Dice loss, designed explicitly for handling class imbalance, further boosts sensitivity to minority change classes. Quantitative experiments conducted on the SECOND dataset demonstrate consistent improvements. Qualitative analysis confirms these improvements, showing clearer segmentation boundaries and more accurate recovery of small-change regions. These findings highlight the effectiveness of attention mechanisms and Dice loss in improving feature representation and addressing class imbalance in semantic change detection tasks.

Title: HYAMD High-Resolution Fundus Image Dataset for age related macular degeneration (AMD) Diagnosis
Authors: Meishar Meisel, Benjamin A. Cohen, Meital Baskin, Beatrice Tiosano, Joachim A. Behar, Eran Berkowitz
Abstract: The Hillel Yaffe Age Related Macular Degeneration (HYAMD) dataset is a longitudinal collection of 1,560 Digital Fundus Images (DFIs) from 325 patients examined at the Hillel Yaffe Medical Center (Hadera, Israel) between 2021 and 2024. The dataset includes an AMD cohort of 147 patients (aged 54-94) with varying stages of AMD and a control group of 190 diabetic retinopathy (DR) patients (aged 24-92). AMD diagnoses were based on comprehensive clinical ophthalmic evaluations, supported by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography. Non-AMD DFIs were sourced from DR patients without concurrent AMD, diagnosed using macular OCT, fluorescein angiography, and widefield imaging. HYAMD provides gold-standard annotations, ensuring AMD labels were assigned following a full clinical assessment. Images were captured with a DRI OCT Triton (Topcon) camera, offering a 45 deg field of view and 1960 x 1934 pixel resolution. To the best of our knowledge, HYAMD is the first open-access retinal dataset from an Israeli sample, designed to support AMD identification using machine learning models.

Title: Robust Speech Recognition with Schrödinger Bridge-Based Speech Enhancement
Authors: Rauf Nasretdinov, Roman Korostik, Ante Jukić
Abstract: In this work, we investigate application of generative speech enhancement to improve the robustness of ASR models in noisy and reverberant conditions. We employ a recently-proposed speech enhancement model based on Schrödinger bridge, which has been shown to perform well compared to diffusion-based approaches. We analyze the impact of model scaling and different sampling methods on the ASR performance. Furthermore, we compare the considered model with predictive and diffusion-based baselines and analyze the speech recognition performance when using different pre-trained ASR models. The proposed approach significantly reduces the word error rate, reducing it by approximately 40% relative to the unprocessed speech signals and by approximately 8% relative to a similarly sized predictive approach.

Title: Self-Calibrating Position Measurements: Applied to Imperfect Hall Sensors
Authors: Max van Meer, Marijn van Noije, Koen Tiels, Enzo Evers, Lennart Blanken, Gert Witvoet, Tom Oomen
Abstract: Linear Hall sensors are a cost-effective alternative to optical encoders for measuring the rotor positions of actuators, with the main challenge being that they exhibit position-dependent inaccuracies resulting from manufacturing tolerances. This paper develops a data-driven calibration procedure for linear analog Hall sensors that enables accurate online estimates of the rotor angle without requiring expensive external encoders. The approach combines closed-loop data collection with nonlinear identification to obtain an accurate model of the sensor inaccuracies, which is subsequently used for online compensation. Simulation results show that when the flux density model structure is known, measurement errors are reduced to the sensor noise floor, and experiments on an industrial setup demonstrate a factor of 2.6 reduction in the root-mean-square measurement error. These results confirm that Hall sensor inaccuracies can be calibrated even when no external encoder is available, improving their practical applicability.

Title: Model-based learning for joint channel estimationand hybrid MIMO precoding
Authors: Nay Klaimi (IETR, INSA Rennes), Amira Bedoui (IETR, INSA Rennes), Clément Elvira (IETR), Philippe Mary (INSA Rennes, IETR), Luc Le Magoarou (INSA Rennes, IETR)
Abstract: Hybrid precoding is a key ingredient of cost-effective massive multiple-input multiple-output transceivers. However, setting jointly digital and analog precoders to optimally serve multiple users is a difficult optimization problem. Moreover, it relies heavily on precise knowledge of the channels, which is difficult to obtain, especially when considering realistic systems comprising hardware impairments. In this paper, a joint channel estimation and hybrid precoding method is proposed, which consists in an end-to- end architecture taking received pilots as inputs and outputting pre- coders. The resulting neural network is fully model-based, making it lightweight and interpretable with very few learnable parameters. The channel estimation step is performed using the unfolded matching pursuit algorithm, accounting for imperfect knowledge of the antenna system, while the precoding step is done via unfolded projected gradient ascent. The great potential of the proposed method is empirically demonstrated on realistic synthetic channels.

Title: Near-Field MIMO Channel Acquisition: Geometry-Aided Feedback and Transmission Design
Authors: Shima Eslami, Bikshapathi Gouda, Antti Tölli
Abstract: Near-field (NF) line-of-sight (LoS) MIMO systems enable efficient channel state information (CSI) acquisition and precoding by exploiting known antenna geometries at both the base station (BS) and user equipment (UE). This paper introduces a compact parameterization of the NF LoS MIMO channel using two angles of departure (AoDs) and a BS-UE relative rotation angle. The inclusion of the second AoD removes the need for fine-grained distance grids imposed by conventional NF channel parametrization. To address the user-specific uplink pilot overhead in multiuser NF CSI acquisition, we propose a scheme that uses a fixed, UE-independent set of downlink pilots transmitted from a carefully selected subset of BS antennas. In dominant LoS conditions, as few as four pilots suffice, with Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) analysis confirming that increased antenna spacing improves estimation accuracy. Each UE estimates and quantizes its angular parameters and feeds them back to the BS for geometry-based CSI reconstruction, eliminating the need for full channel feedback. To enhance robustness against noise, quantization errors, and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) components, we introduce a two-stage precoding method. The initial precoding is computed from estimated LoS CSI and refined through bidirectional over-the-air (OTA) training. Furthermore, a two-step stream allocation strategy reduces pilot and computational overhead. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high data rates with significantly fewer OTA iterations, approaching the performance of perfect CSI.

Title: NN-Based Joint Mitigation of IQ Imbalance and PA Nonlinearity With Multiple States
Authors: Yundi Zhang, Wendong Cheng, Li Chen
Abstract: Joint mitigation of IQ imbalance and PA nonlinearity is important for improving the performance of radio frequency (RF) transmitters. In this paper, we propose a new neural network (NN) model, which can be used for joint digital pre-distortion (DPD) of non-ideal IQ modulators and PAs in a transmitter with multiple operating states. The model is based on the methodology of multi-task learning (MTL). In this model, the hidden layers of the main NN are shared by all signal states, and the output layer's weights and biases are dynamically generated by another NN. The experimental results show that the proposed model can effectively perform joint DPD for IQ-PA systems, and it achieves better overall performance within multiple signal states than the existing methods.

Our evaluation results demonstrate the high quality and effectiveness of this method. Additionally, we show that applying discrete optimal transport as a post-processing step in audio generation can lead to the incorrect classification of synthetic audio as real.

Title: A Heuristic-Integrated DRL Approach for Phase Optimization in Large-Scale RISs
Authors: Wei Wang, Peizheng Li, Angela Doufexi, Mark A. Beach
Abstract: Optimizing discrete phase shifts in large-scale reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) is challenging due to their non-convex and non-linear nature. In this letter, we propose a heuristic-integrated deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that (1) leverages accumulated actions over multiple steps in the double deep Q-network (DDQN) for RIS column-wise control and (2) integrates a greedy algorithm (GA) into each DRL step to refine the state via fine-grained, element-wise optimization of RIS configurations. By learning from GA-included states, the proposed approach effectively addresses RIS optimization within a small DRL action space, demonstrating its capability to optimize phase-shift configurations of large-scale RISs.

Title: Recognizing Ornaments in Vocal Indian Art Music with Active Annotation
Authors: Sumit Kumar, Parampreet Singh, Vipul Arora
Abstract: Ornamentations, embellishments, or microtonal inflections are essential to melodic expression across many musical traditions, adding depth, nuance, and emotional impact to performances. Recognizing ornamentations in singing voices is key to MIR, with potential applications in music pedagogy, singer identification, genre classification, and controlled singing voice generation. However, the lack of annotated datasets and specialized modeling approaches remains a major obstacle for progress in this research area. In this work, we introduce Rāga Ornamentation Detection (ROD), a novel dataset comprising Indian classical music recordings curated by expert musicians. The dataset is annotated using a custom Human-in-the-Loop tool for six vocal ornaments marked as event-based labels. Using this dataset, we develop an ornamentation detection model based on deep time-series analysis, preserving ornament boundaries during the chunking of long audio recordings. We conduct experiments using different train-test configurations within the ROD dataset and also evaluate our approach on a separate, manually annotated dataset of Indian classical concert recordings. Our experimental results support the superior performance of our proposed approach over the baseline CRNN.

Title: SwinLSTM Autoencoder for Temporal-Spatial-Frequency Domain CSI Compression in Massive MIMO Systems
Authors: Aakash Saini, Yunchou Xing, Jee Hyun Kim, Amir Ahmadian Tehrani, Wolfgang Gerstacker
Abstract: This study presents a parameter-light, low-complexity artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) model that enhances channel state information (CSI) feedback in wireless systems by jointly exploiting temporal, spatial, and frequency (TSF) domain correlations. While traditional frameworks use autoencoders for CSI compression at the user equipment (UE) and reconstruction at the network (NW) side in spatial-frequency (SF), massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems in low mobility scenarios exhibit strong temporal correlation alongside frequency and spatial correlations. An autoencoder architecture alone is insufficient to exploit the TSF domain correlation in CSI; a recurrent element is also required. To address the vanishing gradients problem, researchers in recent works have proposed state-of-the-art TSF domain CSI compression architectures that combine recurrent networks for temporal correlation exploitation with deep pre-trained autoencoder that handle SF domain CSI compression. However, this approach increases the number of parameters and computational complexity. To jointly utilize correlations across the TSF domain, we propose a novel, parameter-light, low-complexity AI/ML-based recurrent autoencoder architecture to compress CSI at the UE side and reconstruct it on the NW side while minimizing CSI feedback overhead.

Title: Phase Shift Information Compression in IRS-aided Wireless Systems: Challenges and Opportunities
Authors: Xianhua Yu, Dong Li
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) have emerged as a promising technology for future 6G wireless networks, offering programmable control of the wireless environment by adjusting the phase shifts of reflecting elements. However, IRS performance relies on accurately configuring the phase shifts of reflecting elements, which introduces substantial phase shift information (PSI) delivery overhead, especially in large-scale or rapidly changing environments. This paper first introduces the architecture of IRS-assisted systems and highlights real-world use cases where PSI delivery becomes a critical bottleneck. It then reviews current PSI compression approaches, outlining their limitations in adaptability and scalability. To address these gaps, we propose a prompt-guided PSI compression framework that leverages task-aware prompts and meta-learning to achieve efficient and real-time PSI delivery under diverse conditions. Simulation results show improved reconstruction accuracy and robustness compared to the baseline method. Finally, we discuss open challenges and outline promising directions for future research.

Title: Meta-Learning Driven Lightweight Phase Shift Compression for IRS-Assisted Wireless Systems
Authors: Xianhua Yu, Dong Li, Bowen Gu, Xiaoye Jing, Wen Wu, Tuo Wu, Kan Yu
Abstract: The phase shift information (PSI) overhead poses a critical challenge to enabling real-time intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted wireless systems, particularly under dynamic and resource-constrained conditions. In this paper, we propose a lightweight PSI compression framework, termed meta-learning-driven compression and reconstruction network (MCRNet). By leveraging a few-shot adaptation strategy via model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML), MCRNet enables rapid generalization across diverse IRS configurations with minimal retraining overhead. Furthermore, a novel depthwise convolutional gating (DWCG) module is incorporated into the decoder to achieve adaptive local feature modulation with low computational cost, significantly improving decoding efficiency. Extensive simulations demonstrate that MCRNet achieves competitive normalized mean square error performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines across various compression ratios, while substantially reducing model size and inference latency. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed asymmetric architecture and highlight the practical scalability and real-time applicability of MCRNet for dynamic IRS-assisted wireless deployments.

Title: Image Steganography For Securing Intellicise Wireless Networks: "Invisible Encryption" Against Eavesdroppers
Authors: Bizhu Wang, Song Gao, Rui Meng, Haixiao Gao, Xiaodong Xu, Mengying Sun, Chen Dong, Ping Zhang, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: As one of the most promising technologies for intellicise (intelligent and consice) wireless networks, Semantic Communication (SemCom) significantly improves communication efficiency by extracting, transmitting, and recovering semantic information, while reducing transmission delay. However, an integration of communication and artificial intelligence (AI) also exposes SemCom to security and privacy threats posed by intelligent eavesdroppers. To address this challenge, image steganography in SemCom embeds secret semantic features within cover semantic features, allowing intelligent eavesdroppers to decode only the cover image. This technique offers a form of "invisible encryption" for SemCom. Motivated by these advancements, this paper conducts a comprehensive exploration of integrating image steganography into SemCom. Firstly, we review existing encryption techniques in SemCom and assess the potential of image steganography in enhancing its security. Secondly, we delve into various image steganographic paradigms designed to secure SemCom, encompassing three categories of joint source-channel coding (JSCC) models tailored for image steganography SemCom, along with multiple training strategies. Thirdly, we present a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of coverless steganography SemCom. Finally, we propose future research directions for image steganography SemCom.

Title: Opinion Dynamics on Signed Graphs and Graphons
Authors: Raoul Prisant, Federica Garin, Paolo Frasca
Abstract: In this paper, we make use of graphon theory to study opinion dynamics on large undirected networks. The opinion dynamics models that we take into consideration allow for negative interactions between the individuals, whose opinions can thus grow apart. We consider both the repelling and the opposing models of negative interactions, which have been studied in the literature. We define the repelling and the opposing dynamics on signed graphons and we show that their initial value problem solutions exist and are unique. We then show that, in a suitable sense, the graphon dynamics is a good approximation of the dynamics on large graphs that converge to a graphon. This result applies to large random graphs that are sampled according to a graphon (W-random graphs), for which we provide a new convergence result under very general assumptions.

Title: Integrated equilibrium model for electrified logistics and power systems
Authors: Rui Yao, Xuhang Liu, Anna Scaglione, Shlomo Bekhor, Kenan Zhang
Abstract: This paper proposes an integrated equilibrium model to characterize the complex interactions between electrified logistics systems and electric power delivery systems. The model consists of two major players: an electrified logistics operator (ELO) and a power system operator (PSO). The ELO aims to maximize its profit by strategically scheduling and routing its electric delivery vehicles (e-trucks) for deliveries and charging, in response to the locational marginal price (LMP) set by the PSO. The routing, delivery, and charging behaviors of e-trucks are modeled by a perturbed utility Markov decision process (PU-MDP) while their collective operations are optimized to achieve the ELO's objective by designing rewards in the PU-MDP. On the other hand, PSO optimizes the energy price by considering both the spatiotemporal e-truck charging demand and the base electricity load. The equilibrium of the integrated system is formulated as a fixed point, proved to exist under mild assumptions, and solved for a case study on the Hawaii network via Anderson's fixed-point acceleration algorithm. Along with these numerical results, this paper provides both theoretical insights and practical guidelines to achieve sustainable and efficient operations in modern electrified logistics and power systems.

Title: Accelerating Audio Research with Robotic Dummy Heads
Authors: Austin Lu, Kanad Sarkar, Yongjie Zhuang, Leo Lin, Ryan M Corey, Andrew C Singer
Abstract: This work introduces a robotic dummy head that fuses the acoustic realism of conventional audiological mannequins with the mobility of robots. The proposed device is capable of moving, talking, and listening as people do, and can be used to automate spatially-stationary audio experiments, thus accelerating the pace of audio research. Critically, the device may also be used as a moving sound source in dynamic experiments, due to its quiet motor. This feature differentiates our work from previous robotic acoustic research platforms. Validation that the robot enables high quality audio data collection is provided through various experiments and acoustic measurements. These experiments also demonstrate how the robot might be used to study adaptive binaural beamforming. Design files are provided as open-source to stimulate novel audio research.

Title: Consensus Seminorms and their Applications
Authors: Ron Ofir, Ji Liu, A. Stephen Morse, Brian D. O. Anderson
Abstract: Consensus is a well-studied problem in distributed sensing, computation and control, yet deriving useful and easily computable bounds on the rate of convergence to consensus remains a challenge. We study the applications of seminorms for this goal. We revisit a previously suggested family of seminorms and correct an error made in their original presentation where it was claimed that the a certain seminorm is equal to the well-known coefficient of ergodicity. We then propose a wider family of seminorms which guarantee convergence at an exponential rate of infinite products of matrices which generalizes known results on stochastic matrices to the class of matrices whose row sums are all equal one. Finally, we show that such seminorms cannot be used to bound the rate of convergence of classes larger than the well-known class of scrambling matrices, and pose several open questions for future research.

Title: EchoInk-R1: Exploring Audio-Visual Reasoning in Multimodal LLMs via Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Zhenghao Xing, Xiaowei Hu, Chi-Wing Fu, Wenhai Wang, Jifeng Dai, Pheng-Ann Heng
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced perception across text, vision, and audio, yet they often struggle with structured cross-modal reasoning, particularly when integrating audio and visual signals. We introduce EchoInk-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that enhances such reasoning in MLLMs. Built upon the Qwen2.5-Omni-7B foundation and optimized with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), EchoInk-R1 tackles multiple-choice question answering over synchronized audio-image pairs. To enable this, we curate AVQA-R1-6K, a dataset pairing such audio-image inputs with multiple-choice questions derived from OmniInstruct-v1. EchoInk-R1-7B achieves 85.77% accuracy on the validation set, outperforming the base model, which scores 80.53%, using only 562 reinforcement learning steps. Beyond accuracy, EchoInk-R1 demonstrates reflective reasoning by revisiting initial interpretations and refining responses when facing ambiguous multimodal inputs. These results suggest that lightweight reinforcement learning fine-tuning enhances cross-modal reasoning in MLLMs. EchoInk-R1 is the first framework to unify audio, visual, and textual modalities for general open-world reasoning via reinforcement learning. Code and data are publicly released to facilitate further research.

Title: Pseudo Random Number Generator using Internet-of-Things Techniques on Portable Field-Programmable-Gate-Array Platform
Authors: Tee Hui Teo
Abstract: This paper conducts a comparative study of three IoT-based PRNG models, including Logistic Map, Double Pendulum, and Multi-LFSR, implemented on an FPGA platform. Comparisons are made across key performance metrics like randomness, latency, power consumption, hardware resource usage, energy efficiency, scalability, and application suitability. Compared to Multi-LFSR, Logistic Map, and Double Pendulum Models provide perfect quality randomness, which is quite apt for high-security grade applications; however, the requirements of these models concerning power and hardware resources are also considerably high. By contrast, the Multi-LFSR comes into its own due to its lower latency, power consumption, and resource-efficient design. It is, therefore, suited for embedded or real-time applications. Furthermore, environmental sensors will also be introduced as entropy sources for the PRNGs to enhance the randomness of the systems, particularly in IoT-enabled battery-powered FPGA platforms. The experimental results confirm that the Multi-LFSR model has the highest energy efficiency, while the Logistic Map and Double Pendulum outperform in generating numbers with very high security. The study thus provides a deeper insight into decision- making for selecting PRNG models.

Title: mAIstro: an open-source multi-agentic system for automated end-to-end development of radiomics and deep learning models for medical imaging
Authors: Eleftherios Tzanis, Michail E. Klontzas
Abstract: Agentic systems built on large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for automating complex workflows in healthcare AI. We introduce mAIstro, an open-source, autonomous multi-agentic framework for end-to-end development and deployment of medical AI models. The system orchestrates exploratory data analysis, radiomic feature extraction, image segmentation, classification, and regression through a natural language interface, requiring no coding from the user. Built on a modular architecture, mAIstro supports both open- and closed-source LLMs, and was evaluated using a large and diverse set of prompts across 16 open-source datasets, covering a wide range of imaging modalities, anatomical regions, and data types. The agents successfully executed all tasks, producing interpretable outputs and validated models. This work presents the first agentic framework capable of unifying data analysis, AI model development, and inference across varied healthcare applications, offering a reproducible and extensible foundation for clinical and research AI integration.

Title: Towards Cognitive Collaborative Robots: Semantic-Level Integration and Explainable Control for Human-Centric Cooperation
Authors: Jaehong Oh
Abstract: This is a preprint of a review article that has not yet undergone peer review. The content is intended for early dissemination and academic discussion. The final version may differ upon formal publication. As the Fourth Industrial Revolution reshapes industrial paradigms, human-robot collaboration (HRC) has transitioned from a desirable capability to an operational necessity. In response, collaborative robots (Cobots) are evolving beyond repetitive tasks toward adaptive, semantically informed interaction with humans and environments. This paper surveys five foundational pillars enabling this transformation: semantic-level perception, cognitive action planning, explainable learning and control, safety-aware motion design, and multimodal human intention recognition. We examine the role of semantic mapping in transforming spatial data into meaningful context, and explore cognitive planning frameworks that leverage this context for goal-driven decision-making. Additionally, we analyze explainable reinforcement learning methods, including policy distillation and attention mechanisms, which enhance interpretability and trust. Safety is addressed through force-adaptive control and risk-aware trajectory planning, while seamless human interaction is supported via gaze and gesture-based intent recognition. Despite these advancements, challenges such as perception-action disjunction, real-time explainability limitations, and incomplete human trust persist. To address these, we propose a unified Cognitive Synergy Architecture, integrating all modules into a cohesive framework for truly human-centric cobot collaboration.

Title: Bridging Model Predictive Control and Deep Learning for Scalable Reachability Analysis
Authors: Zeyuan Feng, Le Qiu, Somil Bansal
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a widely used method for ensuring the safety of robotic systems. Traditional approaches compute reachable sets by numerically solving an HJ Partial Differential Equation (PDE) over a grid, which is computationally prohibitive due to the curse of dimensionality. Recent learning-based methods have sought to address this challenge by approximating reachability solutions using neural networks trained with PDE residual error. However, these approaches often suffer from unstable training dynamics and suboptimal solutions due to the weak learning signal provided by the residual loss. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages model predictive control (MPC) techniques to guide and accelerate the reachability learning process. Observing that HJ reachability is inherently rooted in optimal control, we utilize MPC to generate approximate reachability solutions at key collocation points, which are then used to tactically guide the neural network training by ensuring compliance with these approximations. Moreover, we iteratively refine the MPC generated solutions using the learned reachability solution, mitigating convergence to local optima. Case studies on a 2D vertical drone, a 13D quadrotor, a 7D F1Tenth car, and a 40D publisher-subscriber system demonstrate that bridging MPC with deep learning yields significant improvements in the robustness and accuracy of reachable sets, as well as corresponding safety assurances, compared to existing methods.

Title: Contact-Aware Safety in Soft Robots Using High-Order Control Barrier and Lyapunov Functions
Authors: Kiwan Wong, Maximilian Stölzle, Wei Xiao, Cosimo Della Santina, Daniela Rus, Gioele Zardini
Abstract: Robots operating alongside people, particularly in sensitive scenarios such as aiding the elderly with daily tasks or collaborating with workers in manufacturing, must guarantee safety and cultivate user trust. Continuum soft manipulators promise safety through material compliance, but as designs evolve for greater precision, payload capacity, and speed, and increasingly incorporate rigid elements, their injury risk resurfaces. In this letter, we introduce a comprehensive High-Order Control Barrier Function (HOCBF) + High-Order Control Lyapunov Function (HOCLF) framework that enforces strict contact force limits across the entire soft-robot body during environmental interactions. Our approach combines a differentiable Piecewise Cosserat-Segment (PCS) dynamics model with a convex-polygon distance approximation metric, named Differentiable Conservative Separating Axis Theorem (DCSAT), based on the soft robot geometry to enable real-time, whole-body collision detection, resolution, and enforcement of the safety constraints. By embedding HOCBFs into our optimization routine, we guarantee safety and actively regulate environmental coupling, allowing, for instance, safe object manipulation under HOCLF-driven motion objectives. Extensive planar simulations demonstrate that our method maintains safety-bounded contacts while achieving precise shape and task-space regulation. This work thus lays a foundation for the deployment of soft robots in human-centric environments with provable safety and performance.

Title: Modal Decomposition and Identification for a Population of Structures Using Physics-Informed Graph Neural Networks and Transformers
Authors: Xudong Jian, Kiran Bacsa, Gregory Duthé, Eleni Chatzi
Abstract: Modal identification is crucial for structural health monitoring and structural control, providing critical insights into structural dynamics and performance. This study presents a novel deep learning framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs), transformers, and a physics-informed loss function to achieve modal decomposition and identification across a population of structures. The transformer module decomposes multi-degrees-of-freedom (MDOF) structural dynamic measurements into single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) modal responses, facilitating the identification of natural frequencies and damping ratios. Concurrently, the GNN captures the structural configurations and identifies mode shapes corresponding to the decomposed SDOF modal responses. The proposed model is trained in a purely physics-informed and unsupervised manner, leveraging modal decomposition theory and the independence of structural modes to guide learning without the need for labeled data. Validation through numerical simulations and laboratory experiments demonstrates its effectiveness in accurately decomposing dynamic responses and identifying modal properties from sparse structural dynamic measurements, regardless of variations in external loads or structural configurations. Comparative analyses against established modal identification techniques and model variations further underscore its superior performance, positioning it as a favorable approach for population-based structural health monitoring.

Title: LLAMAPIE: Proactive In-Ear Conversation Assistants
Authors: Tuochao Chen, Nicholas Batchelder, Alisa Liu, Noah Smith, Shyamnath Gollakota
Abstract: We introduce LlamaPIE, the first real-time proactive assistant designed to enhance human conversations through discreet, concise guidance delivered via hearable devices. Unlike traditional language models that require explicit user invocation, this assistant operates in the background, anticipating user needs without interrupting conversations. We address several challenges, including determining when to respond, crafting concise responses that enhance conversations, leveraging knowledge of the user for context-aware assistance, and real-time, on-device processing. To achieve this, we construct a semi-synthetic dialogue dataset and propose a two-model pipeline: a small model that decides when to respond and a larger model that generates the response. We evaluate our approach on real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in providing helpful, unobtrusive assistance. User studies with our assistant, implemented on Apple Silicon M2 hardware, show a strong preference for the proactive assistant over both a baseline with no assistance and a reactive model, highlighting the potential of LlamaPie to enhance live conversations.

Title: Advancing Zero-shot Text-to-Speech Intelligibility across Diverse Domains via Preference Alignment
Authors: Xueyao Zhang, Yuancheng Wang, Chaoren Wang, Ziniu Li, Zhuo Chen, Zhizheng Wu
Abstract: Modern zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) systems, despite using extensive pre-training, often struggle in challenging scenarios such as tongue twisters, repeated words, code-switching, and cross-lingual synthesis, leading to intelligibility issues. To address these limitations, this paper leverages preference alignment techniques, which enable targeted construction of out-of-pretraining-distribution data to enhance performance. We introduce a new dataset, named the Intelligibility Preference Speech Dataset (INTP), and extend the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) framework to accommodate diverse TTS architectures. After INTP alignment, in addition to intelligibility, we observe overall improvements including naturalness, similarity, and audio quality for multiple TTS models across diverse domains. Based on that, we also verify the weak-to-strong generalization ability of INTP for more intelligible models such as CosyVoice 2 and Ints. Moreover, we showcase the potential for further improvements through iterative alignment based on Ints. Audio samples are available at this https URL.

Title: On-Device LLM for Context-Aware Wi-Fi Roaming
Authors: Ju-Hyung Lee, Yanqing Lu
Abstract: Wireless roaming is a critical yet challenging task for maintaining seamless connectivity in dynamic mobile environments. Conventional threshold-based or heuristic schemes often fail, leading to either sticky or excessive handovers. We introduce the first cross-layer use of an on-device large language model (LLM): high-level reasoning in the application layer that issues real-time actions executed in the PHY/MAC stack. The LLM addresses two tasks: (i) context-aware AP selection, where structured prompts fuse environmental cues (e.g., location, time) to choose the best BSSID; and (ii) dynamic threshold adjustment, where the model adaptively decides when to roam. To satisfy the tight latency and resource budgets of edge hardware, we apply a suite of optimizations-chain-of-thought prompting, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and quantization. Experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets show that our approach surpasses legacy heuristics and DRL baselines, achieving a strong balance between roaming stability and signal quality. These findings underscore the promise of application-layer LLM reasoning for lower-layer wireless control in future edge systems.

Title: Beyond Task Performance: Human Experience in Human-Robot Collaboration
Authors: Sean Kille, Jan Heinrich Robens, Philipp Dahlinger, Alejandra Rodriguez-Velasquez, Simon Rothfuß, Balint Varga, Andreas Lindenmann, Gerhard Neumann, Sven Matthiesen, Andrea Kiesel, Sören Hohmann
Abstract: Human interaction experience plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of human-machine collaboration, especially as interactions in future systems progress towards tighter physical and functional integration. While automation design has been shown to impact task performance, its influence on human experi- ence metrics such as flow, sense of agency (SoA), and embodiment remains underexplored. This study investigates how variations in automation design affect these psychological experience mea- sures and examines correlations between subjective experience and physiological indicators. A user study was conducted in a simulated wood workshop, where participants collaborated with a lightweight robot under four automation levels. The results of the study indicate that medium automation levels enhance flow, SoA and embodiment, striking a balance between support and user autonomy. In contrast, higher automation, despite optimizing task performance, diminishes perceived flow and agency. Furthermore, we observed that grip force might be considered as a real-time proxy of SoA, while correlations with heart rate variability were inconclusive. The findings underscore the necessity for automation strategies that integrate human- centric metrics, aiming to optimize both performance and user experience in collaborative robotic systems

Title: ELGAR: Expressive Cello Performance Motion Generation for Audio Rendition
Authors: Zhiping Qiu, Yitong Jin, Yuan Wang, Yi Shi, Chongwu Wang, Chao Tan, Xiaobing Li, Feng Yu, Tao Yu, Qionghai Dai
Abstract: The art of instrument performance stands as a vivid manifestation of human creativity and emotion. Nonetheless, generating instrument performance motions is a highly challenging task, as it requires not only capturing intricate movements but also reconstructing the complex dynamics of the performer-instrument interaction. While existing works primarily focus on modeling partial body motions, we propose Expressive ceLlo performance motion Generation for Audio Rendition (ELGAR), a state-of-the-art diffusion-based framework for whole-body fine-grained instrument performance motion generation solely from audio. To emphasize the interactive nature of the instrument performance, we introduce Hand Interactive Contact Loss (HICL) and Bow Interactive Contact Loss (BICL), which effectively guarantee the authenticity of the interplay. Moreover, to better evaluate whether the generated motions align with the semantic context of the music audio, we design novel metrics specifically for string instrument performance motion generation, including finger-contact distance, bow-string distance, and bowing score. Extensive evaluations and ablation studies are conducted to validate the efficacy of the proposed methods. In addition, we put forward a motion generation dataset SPD-GEN, collated and normalized from the MoCap dataset SPD. As demonstrated, ELGAR has shown great potential in generating instrument performance motions with complicated and fast interactions, which will promote further development in areas such as animation, music education, interactive art creation, etc.

Title: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning-based Cooperative Autonomous Driving in Smart Intersections
Authors: Taoyuan Yu, Kui Wang, Zongdian Li, Tao Yu, Kei Sakaguchi
Abstract: Unsignalized intersections pose significant safety and efficiency challenges due to complex traffic flows. This paper proposes a novel roadside unit (RSU)-centric cooperative driving system leveraging global perception and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. The core of the system is an RSU-based decision-making module using a two-stage hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) framework. At first, policies are pre-trained offline using conservative Q-learning (CQL) combined with behavior cloning (BC) on collected dataset. Subsequently, these policies are fine-tuned in the simulation using multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO), aligned with a self-attention mechanism to effectively solve inter-agent dependencies. RSUs perform real-time inference based on the trained models to realize vehicle control via V2I communications. Extensive experiments in CARLA environment demonstrate high effectiveness of the proposed system, by: \textit{(i)} achieving failure rates below 0.03\% in coordinating three connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) through complex intersection scenarios, significantly outperforming the traditional Autoware control method, and \textit{(ii)} exhibiting strong robustness across varying numbers of controlled agents and shows promising generalization capabilities on other maps.

Title: Detecting Concept Drift in Neural Networks Using Chi-squared Goodness of Fit Testing
Authors: Jacob Glenn Ayers, Buvaneswari A. Ramanan, Manzoor A. Khan
Abstract: As the adoption of deep learning models has grown beyond human capacity for verification, meta-algorithms are needed to ensure reliable model inference. Concept drift detection is a field dedicated to identifying statistical shifts that is underutilized in monitoring neural networks that may encounter inference data with distributional characteristics diverging from their training data. Given the wide variety of model architectures, applications, and datasets, it is important that concept drift detection algorithms are adaptable to different inference scenarios. In this paper, we introduce an application of the $\chi^2$ Goodness of Fit Hypothesis Test as a drift detection meta-algorithm applied to a multilayer perceptron, a convolutional neural network, and a transformer trained for machine vision as they are exposed to simulated drift during inference. To that end, we demonstrate how unexpected drops in accuracy due to concept drift can be detected without directly examining the inference outputs. Our approach enhances safety by ensuring models are continually evaluated for reliability across varying conditions.

Title: Consensus-Aware AV Behavior: Trade-offs Between Safety, Interaction, and Performance in Mixed Urban Traffic
Authors: Mohammad Elayan, Wissam Kontar
Abstract: Transportation systems have long been shaped by complexity and heterogeneity, driven by the interdependency of agent actions and traffic outcomes. The deployment of automated vehicles (AVs) in such systems introduces a new challenge: achieving consensus across safety, interaction quality, and traffic performance. In this work, we position consensus as a fundamental property of the traffic system and aim to quantify it. We use high-resolution trajectory data from the Third Generation Simulation (TGSIM) dataset to empirically analyze AV and human-driven vehicle (HDV) behavior at a signalized urban intersection and around vulnerable road users (VRUs). Key metrics, including Time-to-Collision (TTC), Post-Encroachment Time (PET), deceleration patterns, headways, and string stability, are evaluated across the three performance dimensions. Results show that full consensus across safety, interaction, and performance is rare, with only 1.63% of AV-VRU interaction frames meeting all three conditions. These findings highlight the need for AV models that explicitly balance multi-dimensional performance in mixed-traffic environments. Full reproducibility is supported via our open-source codebase on this https URL.

Title: SwinLip: An Efficient Visual Speech Encoder for Lip Reading Using Swin Transformer
Authors: Young-Hu Park, Rae-Hong Park, Hyung-Min Park
Abstract: This paper presents an efficient visual speech encoder for lip reading. While most recent lip reading studies have been based on the ResNet architecture and have achieved significant success, they are not sufficiently suitable for efficiently capturing lip reading features due to high computational complexity in modeling spatio-temporal information. Additionally, using a complex visual model not only increases the complexity of lip reading models but also induces delays in the overall network for multi-modal studies (e.g., audio-visual speech recognition, speech enhancement, and speech separation). To overcome the limitations of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models, we apply the hierarchical structure and window self-attention of the Swin Transformer to lip reading. We configure a new lightweight scale of the Swin Transformer suitable for processing lip reading data and present the SwinLip visual speech encoder, which efficiently reduces computational load by integrating modified Convolution-augmented Transformer (Conformer) temporal embeddings with conventional spatial embeddings in the hierarchical structure. Through extensive experiments, we have validated that our SwinLip successfully improves the performance and inference speed of the lip reading network when applied to various backbones for word and sentence recognition, reducing computational load. In particular, our SwinLip demonstrated robust performance in both English LRW and Mandarin LRW-1000 datasets and achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Mandarin LRW-1000 dataset with less computation compared to the existing state-of-the-art model.

Title: Automatic Music Transcription using Convolutional Neural Networks and Constant-Q transform
Authors: Yohannis Telila, Tommaso Cucinotta, Davide Bacciu
Abstract: Automatic music transcription (AMT) is the problem of analyzing an audio recording of a musical piece and detecting notes that are being played. AMT is a challenging problem, particularly when it comes to polyphonic music. The goal of AMT is to produce a score representation of a music piece, by analyzing a sound signal containing multiple notes played simultaneously. In this work, we design a processing pipeline that can transform classical piano audio files in .wav format into a music score representation. The features from the audio signals are extracted using the constant-Q transform, and the resulting coefficients are used as an input to the convolutional neural network (CNN) model.

Title: Miipher-2: A Universal Speech Restoration Model for Million-Hour Scale Data Restoration
Authors: Shigeki Karita, Yuma Koizumi, Heiga Zen, Haruko Ishikawa, Robin Scheibler, Michiel Bacchiani
Abstract: Training data cleaning is a new application for generative model-based speech restoration (SR). This paper introduces Miipher-2, an SR model designed for million-hour scale data, for training data cleaning for large-scale generative models like large language models. Key challenges addressed include generalization to unseen languages, operation without explicit conditioning (e.g., text, speaker ID), and computational efficiency. Miipher-2 utilizes a frozen, pre-trained Universal Speech Model (USM), supporting over 300 languages, as a robust, conditioning-free feature extractor. To optimize efficiency and minimize memory, Miipher-2 incorporates parallel adapters for predicting clean USM features from noisy inputs and employs the WaneFit neural vocoder for waveform synthesis. These components were trained on 3,000 hours of multi-lingual, studio-quality recordings with augmented degradations, while USM parameters remained fixed. Experimental results demonstrate Miipher-2's superior or comparable performance to conventional SR models in word-error-rate, speaker similarity, and both objective and subjective sound quality scores across all tested languages. Miipher-2 operates efficiently on consumer-grade accelerators, achieving a real-time factor of 0.0078, enabling the processing of a million-hour speech dataset in approximately three days using only 100 such accelerators.

Title: Securing Immersive 360 Video Streams through Attribute-Based Selective Encryption
Authors: Mohammad Waquas Usmani, Susmit Shannigrahi, Michael Zink
Abstract: Delivering high-quality, secure 360° video content introduces unique challenges, primarily due to the high bitrates and interactive demands of immersive media. Traditional HTTPS-based methods, although widely used, face limitations in computational efficiency and scalability when securing these high-resolution streams. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel framework integrating Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) with selective encryption techniques tailored specifically for tiled 360° video streaming. Our approach employs selective encryption of frames at varying levels to reduce computational overhead while ensuring robust protection against unauthorized access. Moreover, we explore viewport-adaptive encryption, dynamically encrypting more frames within tiles occupying larger portions of the viewer's field of view. This targeted method significantly enhances security in critical viewing areas without unnecessary overhead in peripheral regions. We deploy and evaluate our proposed approach using the CloudLab testbed, comparing its performance against traditional HTTPS streaming. Experimental results demonstrate that our ABE-based model achieves reduced computational load on intermediate caches, improves cache hit rates, and maintains comparable visual quality to HTTPS, as assessed by Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion (VMAF).

Title: Leveraging Simultaneous Usage of Edge GPU Hardware Engines for Video Face Detection and Recognition
Authors: Asma Baobaid, Mahmoud Meribout
Abstract: Video face detection and recognition in public places at the edge is required in several applications, such as security reinforcement and contactless access to authorized venues. This paper aims to maximize the simultaneous usage of hardware engines available in edge GPUs nowadays by leveraging the concurrency and pipelining of tasks required for face detection and recognition. This also includes the video decoding task, which is required in most face monitoring applications as the video streams are usually carried via Gbps Ethernet network. This constitutes an improvement over previous works where the tasks are usually allocated to a single engine due to the lack of a unified and automated framework that simultaneously explores all hardware engines. In addition, previously, the input faces were usually embedded in still images or within raw video streams that overlook the burst delay caused by the decoding stage. The results on real-life video streams suggest that simultaneously using all the hardware engines available in the recent NVIDIA edge Orin GPU, higher throughput, and a slight saving of power consumption of around 300 mW, accounting for around 5%, have been achieved while satisfying the real-time performance constraint. The performance gets even higher by considering several video streams simultaneously. Further performance improvement could have been obtained if the number of shuffle layers that were created by the tensor RT framework for the face recognition task was lower. Thus, the paper suggests some hardware improvements to the existing edge GPU processors to enhance their performance even higher.

Title: Edge-GPU Based Face Tracking for Face Detection and Recognition Acceleration
Authors: Asma Baobaid, Mahmoud Meribout
Abstract: Cost-effective machine vision systems dedicated to real-time and accurate face detection and recognition in public places are crucial for many modern applications. However, despite their high performance, which could be reached using specialized edge or cloud AI hardware accelerators, there is still room for improvement in throughput and power consumption. This paper aims to suggest a combined hardware-software approach that optimizes face detection and recognition systems on one of the latest edge GPUs, namely NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin. First, it leverages the simultaneous usage of all its hardware engines to improve processing time. This offers an improvement over previous works where these tasks were mainly allocated automatically and exclusively to the CPU or, to a higher extent, to the GPU core. Additionally, the paper suggests integrating a face tracker module to avoid redundantly running the face recognition algorithm for every frame but only when a new face appears in the scene. The results of extended experiments suggest that simultaneous usage of all the hardware engines that are available in the Orin GPU and tracker integration into the pipeline yield an impressive throughput of 290 FPS (frames per second) on 1920 x 1080 input size frames containing in average of 6 faces/frame. Additionally, a substantial saving of power consumption of around 800 mW was achieved when compared to running the task on the CPU/GPU engines only and without integrating a tracker into the Orin GPU\'92s pipeline. This hardware-codesign approach can pave the way to design high-performance machine vision systems at the edge, critically needed in video monitoring in public places where several nearby cameras are usually deployed for a same scene.

Title: Dynamic Network Flow Optimization for Task Scheduling in PTZ Camera Surveillance Systems
Authors: Mohammad Merati, David Castañón
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for optimizing the scheduling and control of Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) cameras in dynamic surveillance environments. The proposed method integrates Kalman filters for motion prediction with a dynamic network flow model to enhance real-time video capture efficiency. By assigning Kalman filters to tracked objects, the system predicts future locations, enabling precise scheduling of camera tasks. This prediction-driven approach is formulated as a network flow optimization, ensuring scalability and adaptability to various surveillance scenarios. To further reduce redundant monitoring, we also incorporate group-tracking nodes, allowing multiple objects to be captured within a single camera focus when appropriate. In addition, a value-based system is introduced to prioritize camera actions, focusing on the timely capture of critical events. By adjusting the decay rates of these values over time, the system ensures prompt responses to tasks with imminent deadlines. Extensive simulations demonstrate that this approach improves coverage, reduces average wait times, and minimizes missed events compared to traditional master-slave camera systems. Overall, our method significantly enhances the efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness of surveillance systems, particularly in dynamic and crowded environments.

Title: Particle Gibbs without the Gibbs bit
Authors: Adrien Corenflos
Abstract: Exact parameter and trajectory inference in state-space models is typically achieved by one of two methods: particle marginal Metropolis-Hastings (PMMH) or particle Gibbs (PGibbs). PMMH is a pseudo-marginal algorithm which jointly proposes a new trajectory and parameter, and accepts or rejects both at once. PGibbs instead alternates between sampling from the trajectory, using an algorithm known as conditional sequential Monte Carlo (CSMC) and the parameter in a Hastings-within-Gibbs fashion. While particle independent Metropolis Hastings (PIMH), the parameter-free version of PMMH, is known to be statistically worse than CSMC, PGibbs can induce a slow mixing if the parameter and the state trajectory are very correlated. This has made PMMH the method of choice for many practitioners, despite theory and experiments favouring CSMC over PIMH for the parameter-free problem. In this article, we describe a formulation of PGibbs which bypasses the Gibbs step, essentially marginalizing over the trajectory distribution in a fashion similar to PMMH. This is achieved by considering the implementation of a CSMC algortihm for the state-space model integrated over the joint distribution of the current parameter and the parameter proposal. We illustrate the benefits of method on a simple example known to be challenging for PMMH.

Title: Score Distillation Sampling for Audio: Source Separation, Synthesis, and Beyond
Authors: Jessie Richter-Powell, Antonio Torralba, Jonathan Lorraine
Abstract: We introduce Audio-SDS, a generalization of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to text-conditioned audio diffusion models. While SDS was initially designed for text-to-3D generation using image diffusion, its core idea of distilling a powerful generative prior into a separate parametric representation extends to the audio domain. Leveraging a single pretrained model, Audio-SDS enables a broad range of tasks without requiring specialized datasets. In particular, we demonstrate how Audio-SDS can guide physically informed impact sound simulations, calibrate FM-synthesis parameters, and perform prompt-specified source separation. Our findings illustrate the versatility of distillation-based methods across modalities and establish a robust foundation for future work using generative priors in audio tasks.

Abstract: State-of-the-art techniques for modeling, analysis and control of three-phase electrical systems belong to the real-valued multi-input/multi-output (MIMO) domain, or to the complex-valued nonlinear single-input/single-output (SISO) domain. In order to complement both domains while simplifying complexity and offering new analysis and design perspectives, this paper introduces the application of geometric algebra (GA) principles to the modeling, analysis and control of three-phase electrical systems. The key contribution for the modeling part is the identification of the transformation that allows transferring real-valued linear MIMO systems into GA-valued linear SISO representations (with independence of having a balanced or unbalanced system). Closed-loop stability analysis in the new space is addressed by using intrinsic properties of GA. In addition, a recipe for designing stabilizing and decoupling GA-valued controllers is provided. Numerical examples illustrate key developments and experiments corroborate the main findings.

Title: Context-aware LLM-based Safe Control Against Latent Risks
Authors: Xiyu Deng, Quan Khanh Luu, Anh Van Ho, Yorie Nakahira
Abstract: Autonomous control systems face significant challenges in performing complex tasks in the presence of latent risks. To address this, we propose an integrated framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs), numerical optimization, and optimization-based control to facilitate efficient subtask learning while ensuring safety against latent risks. The framework decomposes complex tasks into a sequence of context-aware subtasks that account for latent risks. These subtasks and their parameters are then refined through a multi-time-scale process: high-layer multi-turn in-context learning, mid-layer LLM Chain-of-Thought reasoning and numerical optimization, and low-layer model predictive control. The framework iteratively improves decisions by leveraging qualitative feedback and optimized trajectory data from lower-layer optimization processes and a physics simulator. We validate the proposed framework through simulated case studies involving robot arm and autonomous vehicle scenarios. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can mediate actions based on the context and latent risks and learn complex behaviors efficiently.

Title: Randomized Transport Plans via Hierarchical Fully Probabilistic Design
Authors: Sarah Boufelja Y., Anthony Quinn, Robert Shorten
Abstract: An optimal randomized strategy for design of balanced, normalized mass transport plans is developed. It replaces -- but specializes to -- the deterministic, regularized optimal transport (OT) strategy, which yields only a certainty-equivalent plan. The incompletely specified -- and therefore uncertain -- transport plan is acknowledged to be a random process. Therefore, hierarchical fully probabilistic design (HFPD) is adopted, yielding an optimal hyperprior supported on the set of possible transport plans, and consistent with prior mean constraints on the marginals of the uncertain plan. This Bayesian resetting of the design problem for transport plans -- which we call HFPD-OT -- confers new opportunities. These include (i) a strategy for the generation of a random sample of joint transport plans; (ii) randomized marginal contracts for individual source-target pairs; and (iii) consistent measures of uncertainty in the plan and its contracts. An application in fair market matching is outlined, in which HFPD-OT enables the recruitment of a more diverse subset of contracts -- than is possible in classical OT -- into the delivery of an expected plan.

Title: SelectTTS: Synthesizing Anyone's Voice via Discrete Unit-Based Frame Selection
Authors: Ismail Rasim Ulgen, Shreeram Suresh Chandra, Junchen Lu, Berrak Sisman
Abstract: Synthesizing the voices of unseen speakers remains a persisting challenge in multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS). Existing methods model speaker characteristics through speaker conditioning during training, leading to increased model complexity and limiting reproducibility and accessibility. A lower-complexity method would enable speech synthesis research with limited computational and data resources to reach to a wider use. To this end, we propose SelectTTS, a simple and effective alternative. SelectTTS selects appropriate frames from the target speaker and decodes them using frame-level self-supervised learning (SSL) features. We demonstrate that this approach can effectively capture speaker characteristics for unseen speakers and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art multi-speaker TTS frameworks on both objective and subjective metrics. By directly selecting frames from the target speaker's speech, SelectTTS enables generalization to unseen speakers with significantly lower model complexity. Compared to baselines such as XTTS-v2 and VALL-E, SelectTTS achieves better speaker similarity while reducing model parameters by over 8x and training data requirements by 270x.

Keswani, Pallavi Tiwari, Candice Bolan, Tamas Gonda, Michael G. Goggins, Michael B. Wallace, Ziyue Xu, Ulas Bagci
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across institutions without sharing sensitive data, making it an attractive solution for medical imaging tasks. However, traditional FL methods, such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg), face difficulties in generalizing across domains due to variations in imaging protocols and patient demographics across institutions. This challenge is particularly evident in pancreas MRI segmentation, where anatomical variability and imaging artifacts significantly impact performance. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of FL algorithms for pancreas MRI segmentation and introduce a novel approach that incorporates adaptive aggregation weights. By dynamically adjusting the contribution of each client during model aggregation, our method accounts for domain-specific differences and improves generalization across heterogeneous datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enhances segmentation accuracy and reduces the impact of domain shift compared to conventional FL methods while maintaining privacy-preserving capabilities. Significant performance improvements are observed across multiple hospitals (centers).

Title: Non-Reciprocal Beyond Diagonal RIS: Multiport Network Models and Performance Benefits in Full-Duplex Systems
Authors: Hongyu Li, Bruno Clerckx
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RIS) is a new advance in RIS techniques that introduces reconfigurable inter-element connections to generate scattering matrices not limited to being diagonal. BD-RIS has been recently proposed and proven to have benefits in enhancing channel gain and enlarging coverage in wireless communications. Uniquely, BD-RIS enables reciprocal and non-reciprocal architectures characterized by symmetric and non-symmetric scattering matrices. However, the performance benefits and new use cases enabled by non-reciprocal BD-RIS for wireless systems remain unexplored. This work takes a first step toward closing this knowledge gap and studies the non-reciprocal BD-RIS in full-duplex systems and its performance benefits over reciprocal counterparts. We start by deriving a general RIS aided full-duplex system model using a multiport circuit theory, followed by a simplified channel model based on physically consistent assumptions. With the considered channel model, we investigate the effect of BD-RIS non-reciprocity and identify the theoretical conditions for reciprocal and non-reciprocal BD-RISs to simultaneously achieve the maximum received power of the signal of interest in the uplink and the downlink. Simulation results validate the theories and highlight the significant benefits offered by non-reciprocal BD-RIS in full-duplex systems. The significant gains are achieved because of the non-reciprocity principle which implies that if a wave hits the non-reciprocal BD-RIS from one direction, the surface behaves differently than if it hits from the opposite direction. This enables an uplink user and a downlink user at different locations to optimally communicate with the same full-duplex base station via a non-reciprocal BD-RIS, which would not be possible with reciprocal surfaces.

Title: Spectrum Sharing in Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks: Frameworks, Approaches, and Opportunities
Authors: Bodong Shang, Zheng Wang, Xiangyu Li, Chungang Yang, Chao Ren, Haijun Zhang
Abstract: To accommodate the increasing communication needs in non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), wireless users in remote areas may require access to more spectrum than is currently allocated. Terrestrial networks (TNs), such as cellular networks, are deployed in specific areas, but many underused licensed spectrum bands remain in remote areas. Therefore, bringing NTNs to a shared spectrum with TNs can improve network capacity under reasonable interference management. However, in satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs), the comprehensive coverage of a satellite and the unbalanced communication resources of STINs make it challenging to effectively manage mutual interference between NTN and TN. This article presents the fundamentals and prospects of spectrum sharing (SS) in STINs by introducing four SS frameworks, their potential application scenarios, and technical challenges. Furthermore, advanced SS approaches related to interference management in STINs and performance metrics of SS in STINs are introduced. Moreover, a preliminary performance evaluation showcases the potential for sharing the spectrum between NTN and TN. Finally, future research opportunities for SS in STINs are discussed.

Title: User Selection in Near-Field Gigantic MIMO Systems with Modular Arrays
Authors: José P. González-Coma, Santiago Fernández, F. Javier López-Martínez
Abstract: Modular Arrays (MAs) are a promising architecture to enable multi-user communications in next-generation multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems based on extra-large (XL) or gigantic MIMO (gMIMO) deployments, trading off improved spatial resolution with characteristic interference patterns associated with grating lobes. In this work, we analyze whether MAs can outperform conventional collocated deployments, in terms of achievable sum-spectral efficiency (SE) and served users in a multi-user downlink set-up. First, we provide a rigorous analytical characterization of the inter-user interference for modular gMIMO systems operating in the near field. Then, we leverage these results to optimize the user selection and precoding mechanisms, designing two algorithms that largely outperform existing alternatives in the literature, with different algorithmic complexities. Results show that the proposed algorithms yield over 70% improvements in achievable sum-spectral efficiencies compared to the state of the art. We also illustrate how MAs allows us to serve a larger number of users thanks to their improved spatial resolution, compared to the collocated counterpart.

Title: Uncertainty-Aware Digital Twins: Robust Model Predictive Control using Time-Series Deep Quantile Learning
Authors: Yi-Ping Chen, Ying-Kuan Tsai, Vispi Karkaria, Wei Chen
Abstract: Digital Twins, virtual replicas of physical systems that enable real-time monitoring, model updates, predictions, and decision-making, present novel avenues for proactive control strategies for autonomous systems. However, achieving real-time decision-making in Digital Twins considering uncertainty necessitates an efficient uncertainty quantification (UQ) approach and optimization driven by accurate predictions of system behaviors, which remains a challenge for learning-based methods. This paper presents a simultaneous multi-step robust model predictive control (MPC) framework that incorporates real-time decision-making with uncertainty awareness for Digital Twin systems. Leveraging a multistep ahead predictor named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE) as the surrogate model, this framework differs from conventional MPC models that provide only one-step ahead predictions. In contrast, TiDE can predict future states within the prediction horizon in a one-shot, significantly accelerating MPC. Furthermore, quantile regression is employed with the training of TiDE to perform flexible while computationally efficient UQ on data uncertainty. Consequently, with the deep learning quantiles, the robust MPC problem is formulated into a deterministic optimization problem and provides a safety buffer that accommodates disturbances to enhance constraint satisfaction rate. As a result, the proposed method outperforms existing robust MPC methods by providing less-conservative UQ and has demonstrated efficacy in an engineering case study involving Directed Energy Deposition (DED) additive manufacturing. This proactive while uncertainty-aware control capability positions the proposed method as a potent tool for future Digital Twin applications and real-time process control in engineering systems.

Title: Harnessing Wavefront Curvature and Spatial Correlation in Noncoherent MIMO Communications
Authors: Aniol Martí, Luca Sanguinetti, Meritxell Lamarca, Jaume Riba
Abstract: Noncoherent communication systems have regained interest due to the growing demand for high-mobility and low-latency applications. Most existing studies using large antenna arrays rely on the far-field approximation, which assumes locally plane wavefronts. This assumption becomes inaccurate at higher frequencies and shorter ranges, where wavefront curvature plays a significant role and antenna arrays may operate in the radiative near field. In this letter, we adopt a model for the channel spatial correlation matrix that remains valid in both near and far field scenarios. Using this model, we demonstrate that energy-based noncoherent systems can leverage the benefits of wavefront spherical curvature, even beyond the Fraunhofer distance, revealing that the classical far-field approximation may significantly underestimate system performance. Moreover, we show that large antenna arrays enable the multiplexing of various users even with a noncoherent processing, as well as permitting near-optimal detection with low computational complexity.

Title: mWhisper-Flamingo for Multilingual Audio-Visual Noise-Robust Speech Recognition
Authors: Andrew Rouditchenko, Samuel Thomas, Hilde Kuehne, Rogerio Feris, James Glass
Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) combines lip-based video with audio and can improve performance in noise, but most methods are trained only on English data. One limitation is the lack of large-scale multilingual video data, which makes it hard to train models from scratch. In this work, we propose mWhisper-Flamingo for multilingual AVSR which combines the strengths of a pre-trained audio model (Whisper) and video model (AV-HuBERT). To enable better multi-modal integration and improve the noisy multilingual performance, we introduce decoder modality dropout where the model is trained both on paired audio-visual inputs and separate audio/visual inputs. mWhisper-Flamingo achieves state-of-the-art WER on MuAViC, an AVSR dataset of 9 languages. Audio-visual mWhisper-Flamingo consistently outperforms audio-only Whisper on all languages in noisy conditions.

Title: Proxy Prompt: Endowing SAM and SAM 2 with Auto-Interactive-Prompt for Medical Segmentation
Authors: Wang Xinyi, Kang Hongyu, Wei Peishan, Shuai Li, Yu Sun, Sai Kit Lam, Yongping Zheng
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to address the unmet demand for automated prompting and enhanced human-model interactions of SAM and SAM2 for the sake of promoting their widespread clinical adoption. Specifically, we propose Proxy Prompt (PP), auto-generated by leveraging non-target data with a pre-annotated mask. We devise a novel 3-step context-selection strategy for adaptively selecting the most representative contextual information from non-target data via vision mamba and selective maps, empowering the guiding capability of non-target image-mask pairs for segmentation on target image/video data. To reinforce human-model interactions in PP, we further propose a contextual colorization module via a dual-reverse cross-attention to enhance interactions between target features and contextual-embedding with amplifying distinctive features of user-defined object(s). Via extensive evaluations, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets and yields comparable results with fully-trained models, even when trained with only 16 image masks.

Title: Generating Building-Level Heat Demand Time Series by Combining Occupancy Simulations and Thermal Modeling
Authors: Simon Malacek, José Portela, Yannick Marcus Werner, Sonja Wogrin
Abstract: Despite various efforts, decarbonizing the heating sector remains a significant challenge. To tackle it by smart planning, the availability of highly resolved heating demand data is key. Several existing models provide heating demand only for specific applications. Typically, they either offer time series for a larger area or annual demand data on a building level, but not both simultaneously. Additionally, the diversity in heating demand across different buildings is often not considered. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel method for generating temporally resolved heat demand time series at the building level using publicly available data. The approach integrates a thermal building model with stochastic occupancy simulations that account for variability in user behavior. As a result, the tool serves as a cost-effective resource for cross-sectoral energy system planning and policy development, particularly with a focus on the heating sector. The obtained data can be used to assess the impact of renovation and retrofitting strategies, or to analyze district heating expansion. To illustrate the potential applications of this approach, we conducted a case study in Puertollano (Spain), where we prepared a dataset of heating demand with hourly resolution for each of 9,298 residential buildings. This data was then used to compare two different pathways for the thermal renovation of these buildings. By relying on publicly available data, this method can be adapted and applied to various European regions, offering broad usability in energy system optimization and analysis of decarbonization strategies.

Title: Set-based and Dynamical Feedback-augmented Hands-off Control
Authors: Andrei Sperilă, Sorin Olaru, Stéphane Drobot
Abstract: A novel set-theoretical approach to hands-off control is proposed, which focuses on spatial arguments for command limitation, rather than temporal ones. By employing dynamical feedback alongside invariant set-based constraints, actuation is employed only to drive the system's state inside a "hands-off region" of its state-space, where the plant may freely evolve in open-loop configuration. A computationally-efficient procedure with strong theoretical guarantees is devised, and its effectiveness is showcased via an intuitive practical example.

Title: A Unified Approach to Enforce Non-Negativity Constraint in Neural Network Approximation for Optimal Voltage Regulation (preprint)
Authors: Jiaqi Wu, Jingyi Yuan, Yang Weng, Guangwen Wang
Abstract: Power system voltage regulation is crucial to maintain power quality while integrating intermittent renewable resources in distribution grids. However, the system model on the grid edge is often unknown, making it difficult to model physical equations for optimal control. Therefore, previous work proposes structured data-driven methods like input convex neural networks (ICNN) for "optimal" control without relying on a physical model. While ICNNs offer theoretical guarantees based on restrictive assumptions of non-negative neural network parameters, can one improve the approximation power with an extra step on negative duplication of inputs? We show that such added mirroring step fails to improve accuracy, as a linear combination of the original input and duplicated input is equivalent to a linear operation of ICNN's input without duplication. While this design can not improve performance, we propose a unified approach to embed the non-negativity constraint as a regularized optimization of the neural network, contrary to the existing methods, which added a loosely integrated second step for post-processing on parameter negation. Our integration directly ties back-propagation to simultaneously minimizing the approximation error while enforcing the convexity constraints. Numerical experiments validate the issues of the mirroring method and show that our integrated objective can avoid problems such as unstable training and non-convergence existing in other methods for optimal control.

Title: DGAR: A Unified Domain Generalization Framework for RF-Enabled Human Activity Recognition
Authors: Junshuo Liu, Xin Shi, Robert C. Qiu
Abstract: Radio-frequency (RF)-based human activity recognition (HAR) provides a contactless and privacy-preserving solution for monitoring human behavior in applications such as personalized healthcare, ambient assisted living, and telemedicine. However, real-world deployment is frequently challenged by domain shifts arising from inter-subject variability, heterogeneous physical environments, and unseen activity patterns, resulting in significant performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose DGAR, a domain-generalized activity recognition framework that learns transferable representations without access to target-domain data. DGAR integrates instance-adaptive feature modulation with cross-domain distribution alignment to enhance both personalization and generalization. Specifically, it incorporates a squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block to extract salient spatiotemporal features and employs correlation alignment to mitigate inter-domain discrepancies. Extensive experiments on three public RF-based datasets -- HUST-HAR, Lab-LFM, and Office-LFM -- demonstrate that DGAR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 5.81% improvement in weighted F1-score. These results underscore DGAR's potential to enable generalizable, real-time RF sensing systems in dynamic and personalized healthcare scenarios.

Title: Disturbance-adaptive Model Predictive Control for Bounded Average Constraint Violations
Authors: Jicheng Shi, Colin N. Jones
Abstract: This paper considers stochastic linear time-invariant systems subject to constraints on the average number of state-constraint violations over time without knowing the disturbance distribution. We present a novel disturbance-adaptive model predictive control (DAD-MPC) framework, which adjusts the disturbance model based on measured constraint violations. Using a robust invariance method, DAD-MPC ensures recursive feasibility and guarantees asymptotic or robust bounds on average constraint violations. Additionally, the bounds hold even with an inaccurate disturbance model, which allows for data-driven disturbance quantification methods to be used, such as conformal prediction. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods while satisfying average violation constraints.

Title: Mitigating the Impact of Electrode Shift on Classification Performance in Electromyography-Based Motion Prediction Using Sliding-Window Normalization
Authors: Taichi Tanaka, Isao Nambu, Yasuhiro Wada
Abstract: Electromyography (EMG) signals are used in many applications, including prosthetic hands, assistive suits, and rehabilitation. Recent advances in motion estimation have improved performance, yet challenges remain in cross-subject generalization, electrode shift, and daily variations. When electrode shift occurs, both transfer learning and adversarial domain adaptation improve classification performance by reducing the performance gap to -1\% (eight-class scenario). However, additional data are needed for re-training in transfer learning or for training in adversarial domain adaptation. To address this issue, we investigated a sliding-window normalization (SWN) technique in a real-time prediction scenario. This method combines z-score normalization with a sliding-window approach to reduce the decline in classification performance caused by electrode shift. We validated the effectiveness of SWN using experimental data from a target trajectory tracking task involving the right arm. For three motions classification (rest, flexion, and extension of the elbow) obtained from EMG signals, our offline analysis showed that SWN reduced the differential classification accuracy to -1.0\%, representing a 6.6\% improvement compared to the case without normalization (-7.6\%). Furthermore, when SWN was combined with a strategy that uses a mixture of multiple electrode positions, classification accuracy improved by an additional 2.4\% over the baseline. These results suggest that SWN can effectively reduce the performance degradation caused by electrode shift, thereby enhancing the practicality of EMG-based motion estimation systems.

Title: Design of a compact low loss 2-way millimetre wave power divider for future communication
Authors: Muhammad Asfar Saeed, Augustine O. Nwajana, Muneeb Ahmad
Abstract: In this paper, a rectangular-shaped power divider has been presented operating at 27.9 GHz. The power divider has achieved acceptable results for important parameters such as S11, S12, S21, and S22. The substrate employed for the power divider is Roger 3003 which has a thickness of 1.6 mm. This power divider provides a reflection coefficient of -12.2 dB and an insertion loss of 3.1 dB at 28 GHz. This ka-band T-junction power divider covers 68% of the bandwidth. Dimensions of the ka-band T-junction power divider are 50x80 mm. Due to its dimensions and bandwidth this power divider is more suitable for millimetre wave applications like RADAR, beamforming, and 5G applications.

Title: Measurement-Based Line-Impedance Estimation in the Absence of Phasor Measurement Units
Authors: Plouton Grammatikos, Ali Mohamed Ali, Fabrizio Sossan
Abstract: This paper proposes and compares experimentally several methods to estimate the series resistance and reactance (i.e., the transversal components of the $\pi$-model of a line) of low-voltage lines in distribution grids. It first shows that if phasor measurements are available and the grid nodal voltages and power injections are known, the problem can be formulated and solved as a conventional load flow with properly adjusted unknowns. To solve this problem, we propose an analytical derivation of the Jacobian matrix. If only RMS values are available, such as from smart meters, integrating information from multiple intervals becomes necessary, ultimately opening to least-squares estimations, widely adopted in the literature. In this context, applying the proposed Jacobian contributes to accelerating the problem resolution of existing algorithms. The methods are compared in terms of estimation performance and convergence by using measurements from an experimental distribution grid interfacing real-world components and with realistic size implemented at the Gridlab at HES-SO Valais.

Title: Toward a Harmonized Approach - Requirement-based Structuring of a Safety Assurance Argumentation for Automated Vehicles
Authors: Marvin Loba, Nayel Fabian Salem, Marcus Nolte, Andreas Dotzler, Dieter Ludwig, Markus Maurer
Abstract: Despite increasing testing operation on public roads, media reports on incidents show that safety issues remain to this day. One major cause factoring into this circumstance is high development uncertainty that manufacturers face when deploying these systems in an open context. In particular, one challenge is establishing a valid argument at design time that the vehicle will exhibit reasonable residual risk when operating in its intended operational design domain. Regulations, such as the European Implementing Regulation 2022/1426, require manufacturers to provide a safety assurance argumentation for SAE-Level-4 automated vehicles. While there is extensive literature on assurance cases for safety-critical systems, the domain of automated driving lacks explicit requirements regarding the creation of safety assurance argumentations. In this paper, we aim to narrow this gap by elaborating a requirement-based approach. We derive structural requirements for an argumentation from literature and supplement these with requirements derived from stakeholder concerns. We implement the requirements, yielding a proposal for an overall argumentation structure. The resulting "safety arguments" argue over four topic complexes: The developed product, the underlying process including its conformance/compliance to standards/laws, as well as the argumentations' context and soundness. Finally, we instantiate this structure with respect to domain-specific needs and principles.

Title: JEN-1: Text-Guided Universal Music Generation with Omnidirectional Diffusion Models
Authors: Peike Li, Boyu Chen, Yao Yao, Yikai Wang, Allen Wang, Alex Wang
Abstract: Music generation has attracted growing interest with the advancement of deep generative models. However, generating music conditioned on textual descriptions, known as text-to-music, remains challenging due to the complexity of musical structures and high sampling rate requirements. Despite the task's significance, prevailing generative models exhibit limitations in music quality, computational efficiency, and generalization. This paper introduces JEN-1, a universal high-fidelity model for text-to-music generation. JEN-1 is a diffusion model incorporating both autoregressive and non-autoregressive training. Through in-context learning, JEN-1 performs various generation tasks including text-guided music generation, music inpainting, and continuation. Evaluations demonstrate JEN-1's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in text-music alignment and music quality while maintaining computational efficiency.

Title: Contaminated Multivariate Time-Series Anomaly Detection with Spatio-Temporal Graph Conditional Diffusion Models
Authors: Thi Kieu Khanh Ho, Narges Armanfard
Abstract: Mainstream unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms often excel in academic datasets, yet their real-world performance is restricted due to the controlled experimental conditions involving clean training data. Addressing the challenge of training with noise, a prevalent issue in practical anomaly detection, is frequently overlooked. In a pioneering endeavor, this study delves into the realm of label-level noise within sensory time-series anomaly detection (TSAD). This paper presents a novel and practical end-to-end unsupervised TSAD when the training data is contaminated with anomalies. The introduced approach, called TSAD-C, is devoid of access to abnormality labels during the training phase. TSAD-C encompasses three core modules: a Decontaminator to rectify anomalies (aka noise) present during training, a Long-range Variable Dependency Modeling module to capture long-term intra- and inter-variable dependencies within the decontaminated data that is considered as a surrogate of the pure normal data, and an Anomaly Scoring module to detect anomalies from all types. Our extensive experiments conducted on four reliable and diverse datasets conclusively demonstrate that TSAD-C surpasses existing methodologies, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art in the TSAD field.

Title: Diverse Audio Embeddings-- Bringing Features Back Outperforms CLAP !
Authors: Prateek Verma
Abstract: With the advent of modern AI architectures, a shift has happened towards end-to-end architectures. This pivot has led to neural architectures being trained without domain-specific biases/knowledge, optimized according to the task. We in this paper, learn audio embeddings via diverse feature representations, in this case, domain-specific. For the case of audio classification over hundreds of categories of sound, we learn robust separate embeddings for diverse audio properties such as pitch, timbre, and neural representation, along with also learning it via an end-to-end architecture. We observe handcrafted embeddings, e.g., pitch and timbre-based, although on their own, are not able to beat a fully end-to-end representation, yet adding these together with end-to-end embedding helps us, significantly improve performance. This work would pave the way to bring some domain expertise with end-to-end models to learn robust, diverse representations, surpassing the performance of just training end-to-end models.

Title: Optimal Rates of Convergence for Entropy Regularization in Discounted Markov Decision Processes
Authors: Johannes Müller, Semih Cayci
Abstract: We study the error introduced by entropy regularization in infinite-horizon, discrete, discounted Markov decision processes. We show that this error decreases exponentially in the inverse regularization strength both in a weighted KL-divergence and in value with a problem-specific exponent. This is in contrast to previously known estimates, of the order $O(\tau)$, where $\tau$ is the regularization strength. We provide a lower bound matching our upper bound up to a polynomial term, thereby characterizing the exponential convergence rate for entropy regularization. Our proof relies on the observation that the solutions of entropy-regularized Markov decision processes solve a gradient flow of the unregularized reward with respect to a Riemannian metric common in natural policy gradient methods. This correspondence allows us to identify the limit of this gradient flow as the generalized maximum entropy optimal policy, thereby characterizing the implicit bias of this gradient flow, which corresponds to a time-continuous version of the natural policy gradient method. We use our improved error estimates to show that for entropy-regularized natural policy gradient methods, the overall error decays exponentially in the square root of the number of iterations, improving over existing sublinear guarantees. Finally, we extend our analysis to settings beyond the entropy. In particular, we characterize the implicit bias regarding general convex potentials and their resulting generalized natural policy gradients.

Title: Online Controller Synthesis for Robot Collision Avoidance: A Case Study
Authors: Yuheng Fan, Wang Lin
Abstract: The inherent uncertainty of dynamic environments poses significant challenges for modeling robot behavior, particularly in tasks such as collision avoidance. This paper presents an online controller synthesis framework tailored for robots equipped with deep learning-based perception components, with a focus on addressing distribution shifts. Our approach integrates periodic monitoring and repair mechanisms for the deep neural network perception component, followed by uncertainty reassessment. These uncertainty evaluations are injected into a parametric discrete-time markov chain, enabling the synthesis of robust controllers via probabilistic model checking. To ensure high system availability during the repair process, we propose a dual-component configuration that seamlessly transitions between operational states. Through a case study on robot collision avoidance, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method, showcasing substantial performance improvements over baseline approaches. This work provides a comprehensive and scalable solution for enhancing the safety and reliability of autonomous systems operating in uncertain environments.

Title: Coverage-Guaranteed Speech Emotion Recognition via Calibrated Uncertainty-Adaptive Prediction Sets
Authors: Zijun Jia, Jinsong Yu, Hongyu Long, Diyin Tang
Abstract: Road rage, often triggered by emotional suppression and sudden outbursts, significantly threatens road safety by causing collisions and aggressive behavior. Speech emotion recognition technologies can mitigate this risk by identifying negative emotions early and issuing timely alerts. However, current SER methods, such as those based on hidden markov models and Long short-term memory networks, primarily handle one-dimensional signals, frequently experience overfitting, and lack calibration, limiting their safety-critical effectiveness. We propose a novel risk-controlled prediction framework providing statistically rigorous guarantees on prediction accuracy. This approach employs a calibration set to define a binary loss function indicating whether the true label is included in the prediction set. Using a data-driven threshold $\beta$, we optimize a joint loss function to maintain an expected test loss bounded by a user-specified risk level $\alpha$. Evaluations across six baseline models and two benchmark datasets demonstrate our framework consistently achieves a minimum coverage of $1 - \alpha$, effectively controlling marginal error rates despite varying calibration-test split ratios (e.g., 0.1). The robustness and generalizability of the framework are further validated through an extension to small-batch online calibration under a local exchangeability assumption. We construct a non-negative test martingale to maintain prediction validity even in dynamic and non-exchangeable environments. Cross-dataset tests confirm our method's ability to uphold reliable statistical guarantees in realistic, evolving data scenarios.

Abstract: Despite continuous advancements in cancer treatment, brain metastatic disease remains a significant complication of primary cancer and is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. One approach for improving diagnosis, management, and outcomes is to implement algorithms based on artificial intelligence for the automated segmentation of both pre- and post-treatment MRI brain images. Such algorithms rely on volumetric criteria for lesion identification and treatment response assessment, which are still not available in clinical practice. Therefore, it is critical to establish tools for rapid volumetric segmentations methods that can be translated to clinical practice and that are trained on high quality annotated data. The BraTS-METS 2025 Lighthouse Challenge aims to address this critical need by establishing inter-rater and intra-rater variability in dataset annotation by generating high quality annotated datasets from four individual instances of segmentation by neuroradiologists while being recorded on video (two instances doing "from scratch" and two instances after AI pre-segmentation). This high-quality annotated dataset will be used for testing phase in 2025 Lighthouse challenge and will be publicly released at the completion of the challenge. The 2025 Lighthouse challenge will also release the 2023 and 2024 segmented datasets that were annotated using an established pipeline of pre-segmentation, student annotation, two neuroradiologists checking, and one neuroradiologist finalizing the process. It builds upon its previous edition by including post-treatment cases in the dataset. Using these high-quality annotated datasets, the 2025 Lighthouse challenge plans to test benchmark algorithms for automated segmentation of pre-and post-treatment brain metastases (BM), trained on diverse and multi-institutional datasets of MRI images obtained from patients with brain metastases.

Title: Graph-based Path Planning with Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance for Autonomous Parking
Authors: Farhad Nawaz, Minjun Sung, Darshan Gadginmath, Jovin D'sa, Sangjae Bae, David Isele, Nadia Figueroa, Nikolai Matni, Faizan M. Tariq
Abstract: Safe and efficient path planning in parking scenarios presents a significant challenge due to the presence of cluttered environments filled with static and dynamic obstacles. To address this, we propose a novel and computationally efficient planning strategy that seamlessly integrates the predictions of dynamic obstacles into the planning process, ensuring the generation of collision-free paths. Our approach builds upon the conventional Hybrid A star algorithm by introducing a time-indexed variant that explicitly accounts for the predictions of dynamic obstacles during node exploration in the graph, thus enabling dynamic obstacle avoidance. We integrate the time-indexed Hybrid A star algorithm within an online planning framework to compute local paths at each planning step, guided by an adaptively chosen intermediate goal. The proposed method is validated in diverse parking scenarios, including perpendicular, angled, and parallel parking. Through simulations, we showcase our approach's potential in greatly improving the efficiency and safety when compared to the state of the art spline-based planning method for parking situations.

Title: Fast Sign Retrieval via Sub-band Convolution: An Elementary Extension of Binary Classification
Authors: Fuma Ito, Chihiro Tsutake, Keita Takahashi, Toshiaki Fujii
Abstract: To efficiently compress the sign information of images, we address a sign retrieval problem for the block-wise discrete cosine transformation (DCT): reconstruction of the signs of DCT coefficients from their amplitudes. To this end, we propose a fast sign retrieval method on the basis of binary classification machine learning. We first introduce 3D representations of the amplitudes and signs, where we pack amplitudes/signs belonging to the same frequency band into a 2D slice, referred to as the sub-band block. We then retrieve the signs from the 3D amplitudes via binary classification, where each sign is regarded as a binary label. We implement a binary classification algorithm using convolutional neural networks, which are advantageous for efficiently extracting features in the 3D amplitudes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves accurate sign retrieval with an overwhelmingly low computation cost.

Title: Weakly-supervised Audio Temporal Forgery Localization via Progressive Audio-language Co-learning Network
Authors: Junyan Wu, Wenbo Xu, Wei Lu, Xiangyang Luo, Rui Yang, Shize Guo
Abstract: Audio temporal forgery localization (ATFL) aims to find the precise forgery regions of the partial spoof audio that is purposefully modified. Existing ATFL methods rely on training efficient networks using fine-grained annotations, which are obtained costly and challenging in real-world scenarios. To meet this challenge, in this paper, we propose a progressive audio-language co-learning network (LOCO) that adopts co-learning and self-supervision manners to prompt localization performance under weak supervision scenarios. Specifically, an audio-language co-learning module is first designed to capture forgery consensus features by aligning semantics from temporal and global perspectives. In this module, forgery-aware prompts are constructed by using utterance-level annotations together with learnable prompts, which can incorporate semantic priors into temporal content features dynamically. In addition, a forgery localization module is applied to produce forgery proposals based on fused forgery-class activation sequences. Finally, a progressive refinement strategy is introduced to generate pseudo frame-level labels and leverage supervised semantic contrastive learning to amplify the semantic distinction between real and fake content, thereby continuously optimizing forgery-aware features. Extensive experiments show that the proposed LOCO achieves SOTA performance on three public benchmarks.

Title: Cell-Free Massive MIMO-Assisted SWIPT for IoT Networks
Authors: Mohammadali Mohammadi, Le-Nam Tran, Zahra Mobini, Hien Quoc Ngo, Michail Matthaiou
Abstract: This paper studies cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems that underpin simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) for separate information users (IUs) and energy users (EUs) in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. We propose a joint access point (AP) operation mode selection and power control design, wherein certain APs are designated for energy transmission to EUs, while others are dedicated to information transmission to IUs. The performance of the system, from both a spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) perspective, is comprehensively analyzed. Specifically, we formulate two mixed-integer nonconvex optimization problems for maximizing the average sum-SE and EE, under realistic power consumption models and constraints on the minimum individual SE requirements for individual IUs, minimum HE for individual EUs, and maximum transmit power at each AP. The challenging optimization problems are solved using successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. The proposed framework design is further applied to the average sum-HE maximization and energy harvesting fairness problems. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed joint AP operation mode selection and power control algorithm can achieve EE performance gains of up to $4$-fold and $5$-fold over random AP operation mode selection, with and without power control respectively.
