Title: Large model enhanced computational ghost imaging
Authors: Yifan Chen, Hongjun An, Zhe Sun, Tong Tian, Mingliang Chen, Christian Spielmann, Xuelong Li
Abstract: Ghost imaging (GI) achieves 2D image reconstruction through high-order correlation of 1D bucket signals and 2D light field information, particularly demonstrating enhanced detection sensitivity and high-quality image reconstruction via efficient photon collection in scattering media. Recent investigations have established that deep learning (DL) can substantially enhance the ghost imaging reconstruction quality. Furthermore, with the emergence of large models like SDXL, GPT-4, etc., the constraints of conventional DL in parameters and architecture have been transcended, enabling models to comprehensively explore relationships among all distinct positions within feature sequences. This paradigm shift has significantly advanced the capability of DL in restoring severely degraded and low-resolution imagery, making it particularly advantageous for noise-robust image reconstruction in GI applications. In this paper, we propose the first large imaging model with 1.4 billion parameters that incorporates the physical principles of GI (GILM). The proposed GILM implements a skip connection mechanism to mitigate gradient explosion challenges inherent in deep architectures, ensuring sufficient parametric capacity to capture intricate correlations among object single-pixel measurements. Moreover, GILM leverages multi-head attention mechanism to learn spatial dependencies across pixel points during image reconstruction, facilitating the extraction of comprehensive object information for subsequent reconstruction. We validated the effectiveness of GILM through a series of experiments, including simulated object imaging, imaging objects in free space, and imaging object located 52 meters away in underwater environment. The experimental results show that GILM effectively analyzes the fluctuation trends of the collected signals, thereby optimizing the recovery of the object's image from the acquired data.

Title: QuantU-Net: Efficient Wearable Medical Imaging Using Bitwidth as a Trainable Parameter
Authors: Christiaan Boerkamp, Akhil John Thomas
Abstract: Medical image segmentation, particularly tumor segmentation, is a critical task in medical imaging, with U-Net being a widely adopted convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for this purpose. However, U-Net's high computational and memory requirements pose challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices such as wearable medical systems. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing QuantU-Net, a quantized version of U-Net optimized for efficient deployment on low-power devices like Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Using Brevitas, a PyTorch library for quantization-aware training, we quantize the U-Net model, reducing its precision to an average of 4.24 bits while maintaining a validation accuracy of 94.25%, only 1.89% lower than the floating-point baseline. The quantized model achieves an approximately 8x reduction in size, making it suitable for real-time applications in wearable medical devices. We employ a custom loss function that combines Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) Loss, Dice Loss, and a bitwidth loss function to optimize both segmentation accuracy and the size of the model. Using this custom loss function, we have significantly reduced the training time required to find an optimal combination of bitwidth and accuracy from a hypothetical 6^23 number of training sessions to a single training session. The model's usage of integer arithmetic highlights its potential for deployment on FPGAs and other designated AI accelerator hardware. This work advances the field of medical image segmentation by enabling the deployment of deep learning models on resource-constrained devices, paving the way for real-time, low-power diagnostic solutions in wearable healthcare applications.

Title: A Bi-channel Aided Stitching of Atomic Force Microscopy Images
Authors: Huanhuan Zhao, Ruben Millan Solsona, Marti Checa, Spenser R. Brown, Jennifer L. Morrell-Falvey, Liam Collins, Arpan Biswas
Abstract: Microscopy is an essential tool in scientific research, enabling the visualization of structures at micro- and nanoscale resolutions. However, the field of microscopy often encounters limitations in field-of-view (FOV), restricting the amount of sample that can be imaged in a single capture. To overcome this limitation, image stitching techniques have been developed to seamlessly merge multiple overlapping images into a single, high-resolution composite. The images collected from microscope need to be optimally stitched before accurate physical information can be extracted from post analysis. However, the existing stitching tools either struggle to stitch images together when the microscopy images are feature sparse or cannot address all the transformations of images. To address these issues, we propose a bi-channel aided feature-based image stitching method and demonstrate its use on AFM generated biofilm images. The topographical channel image of AFM data captures the morphological details of the sample, and a stitched topographical image is desired for researchers. We utilize the amplitude channel of AFM data to maximize the matching features and to estimate the position of the original topographical images and show that the proposed bi-channel aided stitching method outperforms the traditional stitching approach. Furthermore, we found that the differentiation of the topographical images along the x-axis provides similar feature information to the amplitude channel image, which generalizes our approach when the amplitude images are not available. Here we demonstrated the application on AFM, but similar approaches could be employed of optical microscopy with brightfield and fluorescence channels. We believe this proposed workflow will benefit the experimentalist to avoid erroneous analysis and discovery due to incorrect stitching.

Title: Neural Network for Blind Unmixing: a novel MatrixConv Unmixing (MCU) Approach
Authors: Chao Zhou, Wei Pu, Miguel Rodrigues
Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) unmixing is a challenging research problem that tries to identify the constituent components, known as endmembers, and their corresponding proportions, known as abundances, in the scene by analysing images captured by hyperspectral cameras. Recently, many deep learning based unmixing approaches have been proposed with the surge of machine learning techniques, especially convolutional neural networks (CNN). However, these methods face two notable challenges: 1. They frequently yield results lacking physical significance, such as signatures corresponding to unknown or non-existent materials. 2. CNNs, as general-purpose network structures, are not explicitly tailored for unmixing tasks. In response to these concerns, our work draws inspiration from double deep image prior (DIP) techniques and algorithm unrolling, presenting a novel network structure that effectively addresses both issues. Specifically, we first propose a MatrixConv Unmixing (MCU) approach for endmember and abundance estimation, respectively, which can be solved via certain iterative solvers. We then unroll these solvers to build two sub-networks, endmember estimation DIP (UEDIP) and abundance estimation DIP (UADIP), to generate the estimation of endmember and abundance, respectively. The overall network is constructed by assembling these two sub-networks. In order to generate meaningful unmixing results, we also propose a composite loss function. To further improve the unmixing quality, we also add explicitly a regularizer for endmember and abundance estimation, respectively. The proposed methods are tested for effectiveness on both synthetic and real datasets.

Title: Frequency selection for the diagnostic characterization of human brain tumours
Authors: Carlos Arizmendi, Alfredo Vellido, Enrique Romero
Abstract: The diagnosis of brain tumours is an extremely sensitive and complex clinical task that must rely upon information gathered through non-invasive techniques. One such technique is magnetic resonance, in the modalities of imaging or spectroscopy. The latter provides plenty of metabolic information about the tumour tissue, but its high dimensionality makes resorting to pattern recognition techniques advisable. In this brief paper, an international database of brain tumours is analyzed resorting to an ad hoc spectral frequency selection procedure combined with nonlinear classification.

Title: Stochastic Model Predictive Control for Sub-Gaussian Noise
Authors: Yunke Ao, Johannes KÃ¶hler, Manish Prajapat, Yarden As, Melanie Zeilinger, Philipp FÃ¼rnstahl, Andreas Krause
Abstract: We propose a stochastic Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework that ensures closed-loop chance constraint satisfaction for linear systems with general sub-Gaussian process and measurement noise. By considering sub-Gaussian noise, we can provide guarantees for a large class of distributions, including time-varying distributions. Specifically, we first provide a new characterization of sub-Gaussian random vectors using matrix variance proxies, which can more accurately represent the predicted state distribution. We then derive tail bounds under linear propagation for the new characterization, enabling tractable computation of probabilistic reachable sets of linear systems. Lastly, we utilize these probabilistic reachable sets to formulate a stochastic MPC scheme that provides closed-loop guarantees for general sub-Gaussian noise. We further demonstrate our approach in simulations, including a challenging task of surgical planning from image observations.

Title: Deformable Registration Framework for Augmented Reality-based Surgical Guidance in Head and Neck Tumor Resection
Authors: Qingyun Yang, Fangjie Li, Jiayi Xu, Zixuan Liu, Sindhura Sridhar, Whitney Jin, Jennifer Du, Jon Heiselman, Michael Miga, Michael Topf, Jie Ying Wu
Abstract: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has one of the highest rates of recurrence cases among solid malignancies. Recurrence rates can be reduced by improving positive margins localization. Frozen section analysis (FSA) of resected specimens is the gold standard for intraoperative margin assessment. However, because of the complex 3D anatomy and the significant shrinkage of resected specimens, accurate margin relocation from specimen back onto the resection site based on FSA results remains challenging. We propose a novel deformable registration framework that uses both the pre-resection upper surface and the post-resection site of the specimen to incorporate thickness information into the registration process. The proposed method significantly improves target registration error (TRE), demonstrating enhanced adaptability to thicker specimens. In tongue specimens, the proposed framework improved TRE by up to 33% as compared to prior deformable registration. Notably, tongue specimens exhibit complex 3D anatomies and hold the highest clinical significance compared to other head and neck specimens from the buccal and skin. We analyzed distinct deformation behaviors in different specimens, highlighting the need for tailored deformation strategies. To further aid intraoperative visualization, we also integrated this framework with an augmented reality-based auto-alignment system. The combined system can accurately and automatically overlay the deformed 3D specimen mesh with positive margin annotation onto the resection site. With a pilot study of the AR guided framework involving two surgeons, the integrated system improved the surgeons' average target relocation error from 9.8 cm to 4.8 cm.

Title: Residual Learning and Filtering Networks for End-to-End Lossless Video Compression
Authors: Md baharul Islam, Afsana Ahsan Jeny
Abstract: Existing learning-based video compression methods still face challenges related to inaccurate motion estimates and inadequate motion compensation structures. These issues result in compression errors and a suboptimal rate-distortion trade-off. To address these challenges, this work presents an end-to-end video compression method that incorporates several key operations. Specifically, we propose an autoencoder-type network with a residual skip connection to efficiently compress motion information. Additionally, we design motion vector and residual frame filtering networks to mitigate compression errors in the video compression system. To improve the effectiveness of the motion compensation network, we utilize powerful nonlinear transforms, such as the Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU), to delve deeper into the motion compensation architecture. Furthermore, a buffer is introduced to fine-tune the previous reference frames, thereby enhancing the reconstructed frame quality. These modules are combined with a carefully designed loss function that assesses the trade-off and enhances the overall video quality of the decoded output. Experimental results showcase the competitive performance of our method on various datasets, including HEVC (sequences B, C, and D), UVG, VTL, and MCL-JCV. The proposed approach tackles the challenges of accurate motion estimation and motion compensation in video compression, and the results highlight its competitive performance compared to existing methods.

Title: High-Precision Overlay Registration via Spatial-Terminal Iterative Learning in Roll-to-Roll Manufacturing
Authors: Zifeng Wang, Xiaoning Jin
Abstract: Roll-to-roll (R2R) printing technologies are promising for high-volume continuous production of substrate-based electronic products. One of the major challenges in R2R flexible electronics printing is achieving tight alignment tolerances, as specified by the device resolution (usually at the micro-meter level), for multi-layer printed electronics. The alignment of the printed patterns in different layers is known as registration. Conventional registration control methods rely on real-time feedback controllers, such as PID control, to regulate the web tension and the web speed. However, those methods may lose effectiveness in compensating for recurring disturbances and supporting effective mitigation of registration errors. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Terminal Iterative Learning Control (STILC) method integrated with PID control to iteratively learn and reduce registration error cycle-by-cycle, converging it to zero. This approach enables unprecedented precision in the creation, integration, and manipulation of multi-layer microstructures in R2R processes. We theoretically prove the convergence of the proposed STILC-PID hybrid approach and validate its effectiveness through a simulated registration error scenario caused by axis mismatch between roller and motor, a common issue in R2R systems. The results demonstrate that the STILC-PID hybrid control method can fully eliminate the registration error after a feasible number of iterations. Additionally, we analyze the impact of different learning gains on the convergence performance of STILC.

Title: Age of Positioning with Stochastic Motion Models
Authors: Wasif J. Hussain, Don-Roberts Emenonye, R. Michael Buehrer, Harpreet S. Dhillon
Abstract: Age of Information (AoI) is a key metric used for evaluating data freshness in communication networks, particularly in systems requiring real-time updates. In positioning applications, maintaining low AoI is critical for ensuring timely and accurate position estimation. This paper introduces an age-informed metric, which we term as Age of Positioning (AoP), that captures the temporal evolution of positioning accuracy for agents following random trajectories and sharing sporadic location updates. Using the widely adopted Random Waypoint (RWP) mobility model, which captures stochastic user movement through waypoint-based trajectories, we derive closed-form expressions for this metric under various queuing disciplines and different modes of operation of the agent. The analytical results are verified with numerical simulations, and the existence of optimal operating conditions is demonstrated.

Title: Reconstruct Anything Model: a lightweight foundation model for computational imaging
Authors: Matthieu Terris, Samuel Hurault, Maxime Song, Julian Tachella
Abstract: Most existing learning-based methods for solving imaging inverse problems can be roughly divided into two classes: iterative algorithms, such as plug-and-play and diffusion methods, that leverage pretrained denoisers, and unrolled architectures that are trained end-to-end for specific imaging problems. Iterative methods in the first class are computationally costly and often provide suboptimal reconstruction performance, whereas unrolled architectures are generally specific to a single inverse problem and require expensive training. In this work, we propose a novel non-iterative, lightweight architecture that incorporates knowledge about the forward operator (acquisition physics and noise parameters) without relying on unrolling. Our model is trained to solve a wide range of inverse problems beyond denoising, including deblurring, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, inpainting, and super-resolution. The proposed model can be easily adapted to unseen inverse problems or datasets with a few fine-tuning steps (up to a few images) in a self-supervised way, without ground-truth references. Throughout a series of experiments, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance from medical imaging to low-photon imaging and microscopy.

Title: Over-the-Air Time-Frequency Synchronization in Distributed ISAC Systems
Authors: Kawon Han, Kaitao Meng, Christos Masouros
Abstract: A distributed integrated sensing and communication (D-ISAC) system offers significant cooperative gains for both sensing and communication performance. These gains, however, can only be fully realized when the distributed nodes are perfectly synchronized, which is a challenge that remains largely unaddressed in current ISAC research. In this paper, we propose an over-the-air time-frequency synchronization framework for the D-ISAC system, leveraging the reciprocity of bistatic sensing channels. This approach overcomes the impractical dependency of traditional methods on a direct line-of-sight (LoS) link, enabling the estimation of time offset (TO) and carrier frequency offset (CFO) between two ISAC nodes even in non-LoS (NLOS) scenarios. To achieve this, we introduce a bistatic signal matching (BSM) technique with delay-Doppler decoupling, which exploits offset reciprocity (OR) in bistatic observations. This method compresses multiple sensing links into a single offset for estimation. We further present off-grid super-resolution estimators for TO and CFO, including the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and the matrix pencil (MP) method, combined with BSM processing. These estimators provide accurate offset estimation compared to spectral cross-correlation techniques. Also, we extend the pairwise synchronization leveraging OR between two nodes to the synchronization of $N$ multiple distributed nodes, referred to as centralized pairwise synchronization. We analyze the Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) for TO and CFO estimates and evaluate the impact of D-ISAC synchronization on the bottom-line target localization performance. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, confirm the theoretical analysis, and demonstrate that the proposed synchronization approach can recover up to 96% of the bottom-line target localization performance of the fully-synchronous D-ISAC.

Title: Acoustic Neural 3D Reconstruction Under Pose Drift
Authors: Tianxiang Lin, Mohamad Qadri, Kevin Zhang, Adithya Pediredla, Christopher A. Metzler, Michael Kaess
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing neural implicit surfaces for 3D reconstruction using acoustic images collected with drifting sensor poses. The accuracy of current state-of-the-art 3D acoustic modeling algorithms is highly dependent on accurate pose estimation; small errors in sensor pose can lead to severe reconstruction artifacts. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that jointly optimizes the neural scene representation and sonar poses. Our algorithm does so by parameterizing the 6DoF poses as learnable parameters and backpropagating gradients through the neural renderer and implicit representation. We validated our algorithm on both real and simulated datasets. It produces high-fidelity 3D reconstructions even under significant pose drift.

Title: Beam Selection in ISAC using Contextual Bandit with Multi-modal Transformer and Transfer Learning
Authors: Mohammad Farzanullah, Han Zhang, Akram Bin Sediq, Ali Afana, Melike Erol-Kantarci
Abstract: Sixth generation (6G) wireless technology is anticipated to introduce Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) as a transformative paradigm. ISAC unifies wireless communication and RADAR or other forms of sensing to optimize spectral and hardware resources. This paper presents a pioneering framework that leverages ISAC sensing data to enhance beam selection processes in complex indoor environments. By integrating multi-modal transformer models with a multi-agent contextual bandit algorithm, our approach utilizes ISAC sensing data to improve communication performance and achieves high spectral efficiency (SE). Specifically, the multi-modal transformer can capture inter-modal relationships, enhancing model generalization across diverse scenarios. Experimental evaluations on the DeepSense 6G dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods, achieving superior beam prediction accuracy and adaptability. In the single-user scenario, we achieve an average SE regret improvement of 49.6% as compared to DRL. Furthermore, we employ transfer reinforcement learning to reduce training time and improve model performance in multi-user environments. In the multi-user scenario, this approach enhances the average SE regret, which is a measure to demonstrate how far the learned policy is from the optimal SE policy, by 19.7% compared to training from scratch, even when the latter is trained 100 times longer.

Title: An Exhaustive Evaluation of TTS- and VC-based Data Augmentation for ASR
Authors: Sewade Ogun, Vincent Colotte, Emmanuel Vincent
Abstract: Augmenting the training data of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems with synthetic data generated by text-to-speech (TTS) or voice conversion (VC) has gained popularity in recent years. Several works have demonstrated improvements in ASR performance using this augmentation approach. However, because of the lower diversity of synthetic speech, naively combining synthetic and real data often does not yield the best results. In this work, we leverage recently proposed flow-based TTS/VC models allowing greater speech diversity, and assess the respective impact of augmenting various speech attributes on the word error rate (WER) achieved by several ASR models. Pitch augmentation and VC-based speaker augmentation are found to be ineffective in our setup. Jointly augmenting all other attributes reduces the WER of a Conformer-Transducer model by 11\% relative on Common Voice and by up to 35\% relative on LibriSpeech compared to training on real data only.

Title: Evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning models in the segmentation of the heart ventricles in parasternal short-axis echocardiograms
Authors: Julian Rene Cuellar Buritica, Vu Dinh, Manjula Burri, Julie Roelandts, James Wendling, Jon D. Klingensmith
Abstract: Previous studies on echocardiogram segmentation are focused on the left ventricle in parasternal long-axis views. In this study, deep-learning models were evaluated on the segmentation of the ventricles in parasternal short-axis echocardiograms (PSAX-echo). Segmentation of the ventricles in complementary echocardiogram views will allow the computation of important metrics with the potential to aid in diagnosing cardio-pulmonary diseases and other cardiomyopathies. Evaluating state-of-the-art models with small datasets can reveal if they improve performance on limited data. PSAX-echo were performed on 33 volunteer women. An experienced cardiologist identified end-diastole and end-systole frames from 387 scans, and expert observers manually traced the contours of the cardiac structures. Traced frames were pre-processed and used to create labels to train 2 specific-domain (Unet-Resnet101 and Unet-ResNet50), and 4 general-domain (3 Segment Anything (SAM) variants, and the Detectron2) deep-learning models. The performance of the models was evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD), and difference in cross-sectional area (DCSA). The Unet-Resnet101 model provided superior performance in the segmentation of the ventricles with 0.83, 4.93 pixels, and 106 pixel2 on average for DSC, HD, and DCSA respectively. A fine-tuned MedSAM model provided a performance of 0.82, 6.66 pixels, and 1252 pixel2, while the Detectron2 model provided 0.78, 2.12 pixels, and 116 pixel2 for the same metrics respectively. Deep-learning models are suitable for the segmentation of the left and right ventricles in PSAX-echo. This study demonstrated that specific-domain trained models such as Unet-ResNet provide higher accuracy for echo segmentation than general-domain segmentation models when working with small and locally acquired datasets.

Title: Accurate Control under Voltage Drop for Rotor Drones
Authors: Yuhang Liu, Jindou Jia, Zihan Yang, Kexin Guo
Abstract: This letter proposes an anti-disturbance control scheme for rotor drones to counteract voltage drop (VD) disturbance caused by voltage drop of the battery, which is a common case for long-time flight or aggressive maneuvers. Firstly, the refined dynamics of rotor drones considering VD disturbance are presented. Based on the dynamics, a voltage drop observer (VDO) is developed to accurately estimate the VD disturbance by decoupling the disturbance and state information of the drone, reducing the conservativeness of conventional disturbance observers. Subsequently, the control scheme integrates the VDO within the translational loop and a fixed-time sliding mode observer (SMO) within the rotational loop, enabling it to address force and torque disturbances caused by voltage drop of the battery. Sufficient real flight experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme under VD disturbance.

Title: Predicting Lifespan of Ground-to-Air Multipath Components in mmWave UAV Channels
Authors: Wahab Khawaja, Rune H. Jacobsen, Sajid Hussain, Ismail Guvenc
Abstract: In mobile ground-to-air (GA) propagation channels, the birth and death of multipath components (MPCs) are frequently observed, and the wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS) assumption does not always hold. Several methods exist for tracking the birth and death of MPCs, however, to the best of knowledge of authors, there is no existing literature that addresses the prediction of the lifespan of the MPCs in nonWSSUS GA propagation channels. In this work, we consider the GA channel as non-WSSUS and individual MPCs across receiver positions are represented as time series based on the Euclidean distance between channel parameters of the MPCs. These time series representations, referred to as path bins, are analyzed using a semi-Markov chain model. The channel parameter variations and dependencies between path bins are used to predict the lifespan of path bins using weighted sum method, machine learning classifiers, and deep neural networks. For comparison, the birth and death of path bins are also modeled using a Poisson distribution and a Markov chain. Simulation results demonstrate that deep neural networks offer highly accurate predictions for the lifespan (including death) of MPC path bins in the considered GA propagation scenario.

Title: Mono2D: A Trainable Monogenic Layer for Robust Knee Cartilage Segmentation on Out-of-Distribution 2D Ultrasound Data
Authors: Alvin Kimbowa, Arjun Parmar, Maziar Badii, David Liu, Matthew Harkey, Ilker Hacihaliloglu
Abstract: Automated knee cartilage segmentation using point-of-care ultrasound devices and deep-learning networks has the potential to enhance the management of knee osteoarthritis. However, segmentation algorithms often struggle with domain shifts caused by variations in ultrasound devices and acquisition parameters, limiting their generalizability. In this paper, we propose Mono2D, a monogenic layer that extracts multi-scale, contrast- and intensity-invariant local phase features using trainable bandpass quadrature filters. This layer mitigates domain shifts, improving generalization to out-of-distribution domains. Mono2D is integrated before the first layer of a segmentation network, and its parameters jointly trained alongside the network's parameters. We evaluated Mono2D on a multi-domain 2D ultrasound knee cartilage dataset for single-source domain generalization (SSDG). Our results demonstrate that Mono2D outperforms other SSDG methods in terms of Dice score and mean average surface distance. To further assess its generalizability, we evaluate Mono2D on a multi-site prostate MRI dataset, where it continues to outperform other SSDG methods, highlighting its potential to improve domain generalization in medical imaging. Nevertheless, further evaluation on diverse datasets is still necessary to assess its clinical utility.

Title: Physical Layer Security for Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)
Authors: Mingjun Sun, Chongjun Ouyang, Shaochuan Wu, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: The pinching-antenna system (PASS) introduces new degrees of freedom (DoFs) for physical layer security (PLS) through pinching beamforming. In this paper, a couple of scenarios for secure beamforming for PASS are studied. 1) For the case with a single legitimate user (Bob) and a single eavesdropper (Eve), a closed-form expression for the optimal baseband beamformer is derived. On this basis, a gradient-based method is proposed to optimize the activated positions of pinching antennas (PAs). 2) For the case with multiple Bobs and multiple Eves, a fractional programming (FP)-based block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm, termed FP-BCD, is proposed for optimizing the weighted secrecy sum-rate (WSSR). Specifically, a closed-form baseband beamformer is obtained via Lagrange multiplier method. Furthermore, owing to the non-convex objective function exhibiting numerous stationary points, a low-complexity one-dimensional search is used to find a high-quality solution of the PAs' activated locations. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate that: i) All proposed algorithms achieve stable convergence within a few iterations, ii) across all considered power ranges, the FP-BCD algorithm outperforms baseline methods using zero-forcing (ZF) and maximal-ratio transmission (MRT) beamforming in terms of the WSSR, and iii) PASS achieves a significantly higher secrecy rate than traditional fixed-antenna systems.

Title: Data-Driven Inverse Optimal Control for Continuous-Time Nonlinear Systems
Authors: Hamed Jabbari Asl, Eiji Uchibe
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel model-free and a partially model-free algorithm for inverse optimal control (IOC), also known as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), aimed at estimating the cost function of continuous-time nonlinear deterministic systems. Using the input-state trajectories of an expert agent, the proposed algorithms separately utilize control policy information and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation to estimate different sets of cost function parameters. This approach allows the algorithms to achieve broader applicability while maintaining a model-free framework. Also, the model-free algorithm reduces complexity compared to existing methods, as it requires solving a forward optimal control problem only once during initialization. Furthermore, in our partially model-free algorithm, this step can be bypassed entirely for systems with known input dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms, highlighting their potential for real-world deployment in autonomous systems and robotics.

Title: Reliable Solution to Dynamic Optimization Problems using Integrated Residual Regularized Direct Collocation
Authors: Yuanbo Nie, Eric C. Kerrigan
Abstract: Direct collocation is a widely used method for solving dynamic optimization problems (DOPs), but its implementation simplicity and computational efficiency are limited for challenging problems like those involving singular arcs. In this paper, we introduce the direct transcription method of integrated residual regularized direct collocation (IRR-DC). This method enforces dynamic constraints through a combination of explicit constraints and penalty terms within discretized DOPs. This method retains the implementation simplicity of direct collocation while significantly improving both solution accuracy and efficiency, particularly for challenging problem types. Through the examples, we demonstrate that for difficult problems where traditional direct collocation results in excessive fluctuations or large errors between collocation points, IRR-DC effectively suppresses oscillations and yields solutions with greater accuracy (several magnitudes lower in various error metrics) compared to other regularization alternatives.

Title: Risk Assessment of Distribution Networks Considering Climate Change and Vegetation Management Impacts
Authors: Di Zhao, Umar Salman, Zongjie Wang
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive risk assessment model for power distribution networks with a focus on the influence of climate conditions and vegetation management on outage risks. Using a dataset comprising outage records, meteorological indicators, and vegetation metrics, this paper develops a logistic regression model that outperformed several alternatives, effectively identifying risk factors in highly imbalanced data. Key features impacting outages include wind speed, vegetation density, quantified as the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and snow type, with wet snow and autumn conditions exhibiting the strongest positive effects. The analysis also shows complex interactions, such as the combined effect of wind speed and EVI, suggesting that vegetation density can moderate the impact of high winds on outages. Simulation case studies, based on a test dataset of 618 samples, demonstrated that the model achieved an 80\% match rate with real-world data within an error tolerance of \(\pm 0.05\), showcasing the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model while highlighting its potential to inform preventive strategies for mitigating outage risks in power distribution networks under high-risk environmental conditions. Future work will integrate vegetation height data from Lidar and explore alternative modeling approaches to capture potential non-linear relationships.

Title: Adaptive and Self-Tuning SBL with Total Variation Priors for Block-Sparse Signal Recovery
Authors: Hamza Djelouat, Reijo Leinonen, Mikko J. SillanpÃ¤Ã¤, Bhaskar D. Rao, Markku Juntti
Abstract: This letter addresses the problem of estimating block sparse signal with unknown group partitions in a multiple measurement vector (MMV) setup. We propose a Bayesian framework by applying an adaptive total variation (TV) penalty on the hyper-parameter space of the sparse signal. The main contributions are two-fold. 1) We extend the TV penalty beyond the immediate neighbor, thus enabling better capture of the signal structure. 2) A dynamic framework is provided to learn the penalty parameter for regularization. It is based on the statistical dependencies between the entries of tentative blocks, thus eliminating the need for fine-tuning. The superior performance of the proposed method is empirically demonstrated by extensive computer simulations with the state-of-art benchmarks. The proposed solution exhibits both excellent performance and robustness against sparsity model mismatch.

Title: Performance Modeling for Correlation-based Neural Decoding of Auditory Attention to Speech
Authors: Simon Geirnaert, Jonas Vanthornhout, Tom Francart, Alexander Bertrand
Abstract: Correlation-based auditory attention decoding (AAD) algorithms exploit neural tracking mechanisms to determine listener attention among competing speech sources via, e.g., electroencephalography signals. The correlation coefficients between the decoded neural responses and encoded speech stimuli of the different speakers then serve as AAD decision variables. A critical trade-off exists between the temporal resolution (the decision window length used to compute these correlations) and the AAD accuracy. This trade-off is typically characterized by evaluating AAD accuracy across multiple window lengths, leading to the performance curve. We propose a novel method to model this trade-off curve using labeled correlations from only a single decision window length. Our approach models the (un)attended correlations with a normal distribution after applying the Fisher transformation, enabling accurate AAD accuracy prediction across different window lengths. We validate the method on two distinct AAD implementations: a linear decoder and the non-linear VLAAI deep neural network, evaluated on separate datasets. Results show consistently low modeling errors of approximately 2 percent points, with 94% of true accuracies falling within estimated 95%-confidence intervals. The proposed method enables efficient performance curve modeling without extensive multi-window length evaluation, facilitating practical applications in, e.g., performance tracking in neuro-steered hearing devices to continuously adapt the system parameters over time.

Title: Task Allocation for Multi-agent Systems via Unequal-dimensional Optimal Transport
Authors: Anqi Dong, Karl H. Johansson, Johan Karlsson
Abstract: We consider a probabilistic model for large-scale task allocation problems for multi-agent systems, aiming to determine an optimal deployment strategy that minimizes the overall transport cost. Specifically, we assign transportation agents to delivery tasks with given pick-up and drop-off locations, pairing the spatial distribution of transport resources with the joint distribution of task origins and destinations. This aligns with the optimal mass transport framework where the problem and is in the unequal-dimensional setting. The task allocation problem can be thus seen as a linear programming problem that minimizes a quadratic transport cost functional, optimizing the energy of all transport units. The problem is motivated by time-sensitive medical deliveries using drones, such as emergency equipment and blood transport. In this paper, we establish the existence, uniqueness, and smoothness of the optimal solution, and illustrate its properties through numerical simulations.

Title: Faithful and Privacy-Preserving Implementation of Average Consensus
Authors: Kaoru Teranishi, Kiminao Kogiso, Takashi Tanaka
Abstract: We propose a protocol based on mechanism design theory and encrypted control to solve average consensus problems among rational and strategic agents while preserving their privacy. The proposed protocol provides a mechanism that incentivizes the agents to faithfully implement the intended behavior specified in the protocol. Furthermore, the protocol runs over encrypted data using homomorphic encryption and secret sharing to protect the privacy of agents. We also analyze the security of the proposed protocol using a simulation paradigm in secure multi-party computation. The proposed protocol demonstrates that mechanism design and encrypted control can complement each other to achieve security under rational adversaries.

Title: Context-aware Constrained Reinforcement Learning Based Energy-Efficient Power Scheduling for Non-stationary XR Data Traffic
Authors: Kexuan Wang, An Liu
Abstract: In XR downlink transmission, energy-efficient power scheduling (EEPS) is essential for conserving power resource while delivering large data packets within hard-latency constraints. Traditional constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) algorithms show promise in EEPS but still struggle with non-convex stochastic constraints, non-stationary data traffic, and sparse delayed packet dropout feedback (rewards) in XR. To overcome these challenges, this paper models the EEPS in XR as a dynamic parameter-constrained Markov decision process (DP-CMDP) with a varying transition function linked to the non-stationary data traffic and solves it by a proposed context-aware constrained reinforcement learning (CACRL) algorithm, which consists of a context inference (CI) module and a CRL module. The CI module trains an encoder and multiple potential networks to characterize the current transition function and reshape the packet dropout rewards according to the context, transforming the original DP-CMDP into a general CMDP with immediate dense rewards. The CRL module employs a policy network to make EEPS decisions under this CMDP and optimizes the policy using a constrained stochastic successive convex approximation (CSSCA) method, which is better suited for non-convex stochastic constraints. Finally, theoretical analyses provide deep insights into the CADAC algorithm, while extensive simulations demonstrate that it outperforms advanced baselines in both power conservation and satisfying packet dropout constraints.

Title: Generalized Tensor-Aided Channel Estimation for Hardware Impaired Device Identification
Authors: Qi Wu, Zeping Sui, Hien Quoc Ngo, Qun Wan, Michail Matthaiou
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the joint generalized channel estimation and device identification problem in Internet of Things (IoT) networks {under multipath propagation}. To fully utilize the received signal, we decompose the generalized channel into three components: transmitter hardware characteristics, path gains, and angles of arrival. By modelling the received signals as parallel factor (PARAFAC) tensors, we develop alternating least squares (ALS)-based algorithms to simultaneously estimate the generalized channels and identify the transmitters. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms {both Khatri-Rao Factorization (KRF) and the conventional least squares (LS) method} in terms of channel estimation accuracy and achieves performance close to the derived Cramer-Rao lower bound.

Title: Precoder Learning by Leveraging Unitary Equivariance Property
Authors: Yilun Ge, Shuyao Liao, Shengqian Han, Chenyang Yang
Abstract: Incorporating mathematical properties of a wireless policy to be learned into the design of deep neural networks (DNNs) is effective for enhancing learning efficiency. Multi-user precoding policy in multi-antenna system, which is the mapping from channel matrix to precoding matrix, possesses a permutation equivariance property, which has been harnessed to design the parameter sharing structure of the weight matrix of DNNs. In this paper, we study a stronger property than permutation equivariance, namely unitary equivariance, for precoder learning. We first show that a DNN with unitary equivariance designed by further introducing parameter sharing into a permutation equivariant DNN is unable to learn the optimal precoder. We proceed to develop a novel non-linear weighting process satisfying unitary equivariance and then construct a joint unitary and permutation equivariant DNN. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DNN not only outperforms existing learning methods in learning performance and generalizability but also reduces training complexity.

Title: Multiple Speaker Separation from Noisy Sources in Reverberant Rooms using Relative Transfer Matrix
Authors: Wageesha N. Manamperi, Thushara D. Abhayapala
Abstract: Separation of simultaneously active multiple speakers is a difficult task in environments with strong reverberation and many background noise sources. This paper uses the relative transfer matrix (ReTM), a generalization of the relative transfer function of a room, to propose a simple yet novel approach for separating concurrent speakers using noisy multichannel microphone recordings. The proposed method (i) allows multiple speech and background noise sources, (ii) includes reverberation, (iii) does not need the knowledge of the locations of speech and noise sources nor microphone locations and their relative geometry, and (iv) uses relatively small segment of recordings for training. We illustrate the speech source separation capability with improved intelligibility using a simulation study consisting of four speakers in the presence of three noise sources in a reverberant room. We also show the applicability of the method in a practical experiment in a real room.

Title: A Model-based Approach for Glucose Control via Physical Activity
Authors: Pierluigi Francesco De Paola, Alessandro Borri, Alessia Paglialonga, Pasquale Palumbo, Fabrizio Dabbene
Abstract: The role played by physical activity in slowing down the progression of type-2 diabetes is well recognized. However, except for general clinical guidelines, quantitative real-time estimates of the recommended amount of physical activity, based on the evolving individual conditions, are {still missing} in the literature. The aim of this work is to provide a control-theoretical formulation of the exercise encoding all the exercise-related features (intensity, duration, period). Specifically, we design a feedback law in terms of recommended physical activity, following a model predictive control approach, based on a widespread compact diabetes progression model, suitably modified to account for the long-term effects of regular exercise. Preliminary simulations show promising results, well aligned with clinical evidence. These findings can be the basis for further validation of the control law on high-dimensional diabetes progression models to ultimately translate the predictions of the controller into meaningful recommendations.

Title: The R2D2 Deep Neural Network Series for Scalable Non-Cartesian Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Authors: Yiwei Chen, Amir Aghabiglou, Shijie Chen, Motahare Torki, Chao Tang, Ruud B. van Heeswijk, Yves Wiaux
Abstract: We introduce the R2D2 Deep Neural Network (DNN) series paradigm for fast and scalable image reconstruction from highly-accelerated non-Cartesian k-space acquisitions in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). While unrolled DNN architectures provide a robust image formation approach via data-consistency layers, embedding non-uniform fast Fourier transform operators in a DNN can become impractical to train at large scale, e.g in 2D MRI with a large number of coils, or for higher-dimensional imaging. Plug-and-play approaches that alternate a learned denoiser blind to the measurement setting with a data-consistency step are not affected by this limitation but their highly iterative nature implies slow reconstruction. To address this scalability challenge, we leverage the R2D2 paradigm that was recently introduced to enable ultra-fast reconstruction for large-scale Fourier imaging in radio astronomy. R2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images iteratively estimated as outputs of DNN modules taking the previous iteration's data residual as input. The method can be interpreted as a learned version of the Matching Pursuit algorithm. A series of R2D2 DNN modules were sequentially trained in a supervised manner on the fastMRI dataset and validated for 2D multi-coil MRI in simulation and on real data, targeting highly under-sampled radial k-space sampling. Results suggest that a series with only few DNNs achieves superior reconstruction quality over its unrolled incarnation R2D2-Net (whose training is also much less scalable), and over the state-of-the-art diffusion-based "Decomposed Diffusion Sampler" approach (also characterised by a slower reconstruction process).

Title: FCaS: Fine-grained Cardiac Image Synthesis based on 3D Template Conditional Diffusion Model
Authors: Jiahao Xia, Yutao Hu, Yaolei Qi, Zhenliang Li, Wenqi Shao, Junjun He, Ying Fu, Longjiang Zhang, Guanyu Yang
Abstract: Solving medical imaging data scarcity through semantic image generation has attracted significant attention in recent years. However, existing methods primarily focus on generating whole-organ or large-tissue structures, showing limited effectiveness for organs with fine-grained structure. Due to stringent topological consistency, fragile coronary features, and complex 3D morphological heterogeneity in cardiac imaging, accurately reconstructing fine-grained anatomical details of the heart remains a great challenge. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose the Fine-grained Cardiac image Synthesis(FCaS) framework, established on 3D template conditional diffusion model. FCaS achieves precise cardiac structure generation using Template-guided Conditional Diffusion Model (TCDM) through bidirectional mechanisms, which provides the fine-grained topological structure information of target image through the guidance of template. Meanwhile, we design a deformable Mask Generation Module (MGM) to mitigate the scarcity of high-quality and diverse reference mask in the generation process. Furthermore, to alleviate the confusion caused by imprecise synthetic images, we propose a Confidence-aware Adaptive Learning (CAL) strategy to facilitate the pre-training of downstream segmentation tasks. Specifically, we introduce the Skip-Sampling Variance (SSV) estimation to obtain confidence maps, which are subsequently employed to rectify the pre-training on downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that images generated from FCaS achieves state-of-the-art performance in topological consistency and visual quality, which significantly facilitates the downstream tasks as well. Code will be released in the future.

Title: Pulling Back Theorem for Generalizing the Diagonal Averaging Principle in Symplectic Geometry Mode Decomposition
Authors: Hong-Yan Zhang, Haoting Liu, Zhi-Qiang Feng, Ci-Fei Dong, Rui-Jia Lin, Yu Zhou, Fu-Yun Li
Abstract: The symplectic geometry mode decomposition (SGMD) is a powerful method for analyzing time sequences. The SGMD is based on the upper conversion via embedding and down conversion via diagonal averaging principle (DAP) inherited from the singular spectrum analysis (SSA). However, there are two defects in the DAP: it just hold for the time delay $\tau=1$ in the trajectory matrix and it fails for the time sequence of type-1 with the form $X=\{x[n]\}^N_{n=1}$. In order to overcome these disadvantages, the inverse step for embedding is explored with binary Diophantine equation in number theory. The contributions of this work lie in three aspects: firstly, the pulling back theorem is proposed and proved, which state the general formula for converting the component of trajectory matrix to the component of time sequence for the general representation of time sequence and for any time delay $\tau\ge 1$; secondly a unified framework for decomposing both the deterministic and random time sequences into multiple modes is presented and explained; finally, the guidance of configuring the time delay is suggested, namely the time delay should be selected in a limited range via balancing the efficiency of matrix computation and accuracy of state estimation. It could be expected that the pulling back theorem will help the researchers and engineers to deepen the understanding of the theory and extend the applications of the SGMD and SSA in analyzing time sequences.

Title: Fair Federated Medical Image Classification Against Quality Shift via Inter-Client Progressive State Matching
Authors: Nannan Wu, Zhuo Kuang, Zengqiang Yan, Ping Wang, Li Yu
Abstract: Despite the potential of federated learning in medical applications, inconsistent imaging quality across institutions-stemming from lower-quality data from a minority of clients-biases federated models toward more common high-quality images. This raises significant fairness concerns. Existing fair federated learning methods have demonstrated some effectiveness in solving this problem by aligning a single 0th- or 1st-order state of convergence (e.g., training loss or sharpness). However, we argue in this work that fairness based on such a single state is still not an adequate surrogate for fairness during testing, as these single metrics fail to fully capture the convergence characteristics, making them suboptimal for guiding fair learning. To address this limitation, we develop a generalized framework. Specifically, we propose assessing convergence using multiple states, defined as sharpness or perturbed loss computed at varying search distances. Building on this comprehensive assessment, we propose promoting fairness for these states across clients to achieve our ultimate fairness objective. This is accomplished through the proposed method, FedISM+. In FedISM+, the search distance evolves over time, progressively focusing on different states. We then incorporate two components in local training and global aggregation to ensure cross-client fairness for each state. This gradually makes convergence equitable for all states, thereby improving fairness during testing. Our empirical evaluations, performed on the well-known RSNA ICH and ISIC 2019 datasets, demonstrate the superiority of FedISM+ over existing state-of-the-art methods for fair federated learning.

Title: Towards a robust R2D2 paradigm for radio-interferometric imaging: revisiting DNN training and architecture
Authors: Amir Aghabiglou, Chung San Chu, Chao Tang, Arwa Dabbech, Yves Wiaux
Abstract: The R2D2 Deep Neural Network (DNN) series was recently introduced for image formation in radio interferometry. It can be understood as a learned version of CLEAN, whose minor cycles are substituted with DNNs. We revisit R2D2 on the grounds of series convergence, training methodology, and DNN architecture, improving its robustness in terms of generalisability beyond training conditions, capability to deliver high data fidelity, and epistemic uncertainty. Firstly, while still focusing on telescope-specific training, we enhance the learning process by randomising Fourier sampling integration times, incorporating multi-scan multi-noise configurations, and varying imaging settings, including pixel resolution and visibility-weighting scheme. Secondly, we introduce a convergence criterion whereby the reconstruction process stops when the data residual is compatible with noise, rather than simply using all available DNNs. This not only increases the reconstruction efficiency by reducing its computational cost, but also refines training by pruning out the data/image pairs for which optimal data fidelity is reached before training the next DNN. Thirdly, we substitute R2D2's early U-Net DNN with a novel architecture (U-WDSR) combining U-Net and WDSR, which leverages wide activation, dense connections, weight normalisation, and low-rank convolution to improve feature reuse and reconstruction precision. As previously, R2D2 was trained for monochromatic intensity imaging with the Very Large Array (VLA) at fixed $512 \times 512$ image size. Simulations on a wide range of inverse problems and a case study on real data reveal that the new R2D2 model consistently outperforms its earlier version in image reconstruction quality, data fidelity, and epistemic uncertainty.

Title: The Algorithmic State Architecture (ASA): An Integrated Framework for AI-Enabled Government
Authors: Zeynep Engin, Jon Crowcroft, David Hand, Philip Treleaven
Abstract: As artificial intelligence transforms public sector operations, governments struggle to integrate technological innovations into coherent systems for effective service delivery. This paper introduces the Algorithmic State Architecture (ASA), a novel four-layer framework conceptualising how Digital Public Infrastructure, Data-for-Policy, Algorithmic Government/Governance, and GovTech interact as an integrated system in AI-enabled states. Unlike approaches that treat these as parallel developments, ASA positions them as interdependent layers with specific enabling relationships and feedback mechanisms. Through comparative analysis of implementations in Estonia, Singapore, India, and the UK, we demonstrate how foundational digital infrastructure enables systematic data collection, which powers algorithmic decision-making processes, ultimately manifesting in user-facing services. Our analysis reveals that successful implementations require balanced development across all layers, with particular attention to integration mechanisms between them. The framework contributes to both theory and practice by bridging previously disconnected domains of digital government research, identifying critical dependencies that influence implementation success, and providing a structured approach for analysing the maturity and development pathways of AI-enabled government systems.

Title: SIMAC: A Semantic-Driven Integrated Multimodal Sensing And Communication Framework
Authors: Yubo Peng, Luping Xiang, Kun Yang, Feibo Jiang, Kezhi Wang, Dapeng Oliver Wu
Abstract: Traditional single-modality sensing faces limitations in accuracy and capability, and its decoupled implementation with communication systems increases latency in bandwidth-constrained environments. Additionally, single-task-oriented sensing systems fail to address users' diverse demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose a semantic-driven integrated multimodal sensing and communication (SIMAC) framework. This framework leverages a joint source-channel coding architecture to achieve simultaneous sensing decoding and transmission of sensing results. Specifically, SIMAC first introduces a multimodal semantic fusion (MSF) network, which employs two extractors to extract semantic information from radar signals and images, respectively. MSF then applies cross-attention mechanisms to fuse these unimodal features and generate multimodal semantic representations. Secondly, we present a large language model (LLM)-based semantic encoder (LSE), where relevant communication parameters and multimodal semantics are mapped into a unified latent space and input to the LLM, enabling channel-adaptive semantic encoding. Thirdly, a task-oriented sensing semantic decoder (SSD) is proposed, in which different decoded heads are designed according to the specific needs of tasks. Simultaneously, a multi-task learning strategy is introduced to train the SIMAC framework, achieving diverse sensing services. Finally, experimental simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves diverse sensing services and higher accuracy.

Title: Cooperative Bearing-Only Target Pursuit via Multiagent Reinforcement Learning: Design and Experiment
Authors: Jianan Li, Zhikun Wang, Susheng Ding, Shiliang Guo, Shiyu Zhao
Abstract: This paper addresses the multi-robot pursuit problem for an unknown target, encompassing both target state estimation and pursuit control. First, in state estimation, we focus on using only bearing information, as it is readily available from vision sensors and effective for small, distant targets. Challenges such as instability due to the nonlinearity of bearing measurements and singularities in the two-angle representation are addressed through a proposed uniform bearing-only information filter. This filter integrates multiple 3D bearing measurements, provides a concise formulation, and enhances stability and resilience to target loss caused by limited field of view (FoV). Second, in target pursuit control within complex environments, where challenges such as heterogeneity and limited FoV arise, conventional methods like differential games or Voronoi partitioning often prove inadequate. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework, enabling multiple heterogeneous vehicles to search, localize, and follow a target while effectively handling those challenges. Third, to bridge the sim-to-real gap, we propose two key techniques: incorporating adjustable low-level control gains in training to replicate the dynamics of real-world autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs), and proposing spectral-normalized RL algorithms to enhance policy smoothness and robustness. Finally, we demonstrate the successful zero-shot transfer of the MARL controllers to AGVs, validating the effectiveness and practical feasibility of our approach.

Title: QUIET-SR: Quantum Image Enhancement Transformer for Single Image Super-Resolution
Authors: Siddhant Dutta, Nouhaila Innan, Khadijeh Najafi, Sadok Ben Yahia, Muhammad Shafique
Abstract: Recent advancements in Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) using deep learning have significantly improved image restoration quality. However, the high computational cost of processing high-resolution images due to the large number of parameters in classical models, along with the scalability challenges of quantum algorithms for image processing, remains a major obstacle. In this paper, we propose the Quantum Image Enhancement Transformer for Super-Resolution (QUIET-SR), a hybrid framework that extends the Swin transformer architecture with a novel shifted quantum window attention mechanism, built upon variational quantum neural networks. QUIET-SR effectively captures complex residual mappings between low-resolution and high-resolution images, leveraging quantum attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction and image restoration while requiring a minimal number of qubits, making it suitable for the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. We evaluate our framework in MNIST (30.24 PSNR, 0.989 SSIM), FashionMNIST (29.76 PSNR, 0.976 SSIM) and the MedMNIST dataset collection, demonstrating that QUIET-SR achieves PSNR and SSIM scores comparable to state-of-the-art methods while using fewer parameters. These findings highlight the potential of scalable variational quantum machine learning models for SISR, marking a step toward practical quantum-enhanced image super-resolution.

Title: Contextual Speech Extraction: Leveraging Textual History as an Implicit Cue for Target Speech Extraction
Authors: Minsu Kim, Rodrigo Mira, Honglie Chen, Stavros Petridis, Maja Pantic
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a novel approach for Target Speech Extraction (TSE), which relies solely on textual context to extract the target speech. We refer to this task as Contextual Speech Extraction (CSE). Unlike traditional TSE methods that rely on pre-recorded enrollment utterances, video of the target speaker's face, spatial information, or other explicit cues to identify the target stream, our proposed method requires only a few turns of previous dialogue (or monologue) history. This approach is naturally feasible in mobile messaging environments where voice recordings are typically preceded by textual dialogue that can be leveraged implicitly. We present three CSE models and analyze their performances on three datasets. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that even when the model relies purely on dialogue history, it can achieve over 90 % accuracy in identifying the correct target stream with only two previous dialogue turns. Furthermore, we show that by leveraging both textual context and enrollment utterances as cues during training, we further enhance our model's flexibility and effectiveness, allowing us to use either cue during inference, or combine both for improved performance.

Abstract: Sound effects model design commonly uses digital signal processing techniques with full control ability, but it is difficult to achieve realism within a limited number of parameters. Recently, neural sound effects synthesis methods have emerged as a promising approach for generating high-quality and realistic sounds, but the process of synthesizing the desired sound poses difficulties in terms of control. This paper presents a real-time neural synthesis model guided by a physically inspired model, enabling the generation of high-quality sounds while inheriting the control interface of the physically inspired model. We showcase the superior performance of our model in terms of sound quality and control.

Title: HessianForge: Scalable LiDAR reconstruction with Physics-Informed Neural Representation and Smoothness Energy Constraints
Authors: Hrishikesh Viswanath, Md Ashiqur Rahman, Chi Lin, Damon Conover, Aniket Bera
Abstract: Accurate and efficient 3D mapping of large-scale outdoor environments from LiDAR measurements is a fundamental challenge in robotics, particularly towards ensuring smooth and artifact-free surface reconstructions. Although the state-of-the-art methods focus on memory-efficient neural representations for high-fidelity surface generation, they often fail to produce artifact-free manifolds, with artifacts arising due to noisy and sparse inputs. To address this issue, we frame surface mapping as a physics-informed energy optimization problem, enforcing surface smoothness by optimizing an energy functional that penalizes sharp surface ridges. Specifically, we propose a deep learning based approach that learns the signed distance field (SDF) of the surface manifold from raw LiDAR point clouds using a physics-informed loss function that optimizes the $L_2$-Hessian energy of the surface. Our learning framework includes a hierarchical octree based input feature encoding and a multi-scale neural network to iteratively refine the signed distance field at different scales of resolution. Lastly, we introduce a test-time refinement strategy to correct topological inconsistencies and edge distortions that can arise in the generated mesh. We propose a \texttt{CUDA}-accelerated least-squares optimization that locally adjusts vertex positions to enforce feature-preserving smoothing. We evaluate our approach on large-scale outdoor datasets and demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of improved accuracy and smoothness.

Title: Data-driven Nonlinear Modal Analysis with Physics-constrained Deep Learning: Numerical and Experimental Study
Authors: Abdolvahhab Rostamijavanani, Shanwu Li, Yongchao Yang
Abstract: To fully understand, analyze, and determine the behavior of dynamical systems, it is crucial to identify their intrinsic modal coordinates. In nonlinear dynamical systems, this task is challenging as the modal transformation based on the superposition principle that works well for linear systems is no longer applicable. To understand the nonlinear dynamics of a system, one of the main approaches is to use the framework of Nonlinear Normal Modes (NNMs) which attempts to provide an in-depth representation. In this research, we examine the effectiveness of NNMs in characterizing nonlinear dynamical systems. Given the difficulty of obtaining closed-form models or equations for these real-world systems, we present a data-driven framework that combines physics and deep learning to the nonlinear modal transformation function of NNMs from response data only. We assess the framework's ability to represent the system by analyzing its mode decomposition, reconstruction, and prediction accuracy using a nonlinear beam as an example. Initially, we perform numerical simulations on a nonlinear beam at different energy levels in both linear and nonlinear scenarios. Afterward, using experimental vibration data of a nonlinear beam, we isolate the first two NNMs. It is observed that the NNMs' frequency values increase as the excitation level of energy increases, and the configuration plots become more twisted (more nonlinear). In the experiment, the framework successfully decomposed the first two NNMs of the nonlinear beam using experimental free vibration data and captured the dynamics of the structure via prediction and reconstruction of some physical points of the beam.

Title: TetraGrip: Sensor-Driven Multi-Suction Reactive Object Manipulation in Cluttered Scenes
Authors: Paolo Torrado, Joshua Levin, Markus Grotz, Joshua Smith
Abstract: Warehouse robotic systems equipped with vacuum grippers must reliably grasp a diverse range of objects from densely packed shelves. However, these environments present significant challenges, including occlusions, diverse object orientations, stacked and obstructed items, and surfaces that are difficult to suction. We introduce \tetra, a novel vacuum-based grasping strategy featuring four suction cups mounted on linear actuators. Each actuator is equipped with an optical time-of-flight (ToF) proximity sensor, enabling reactive grasping. We evaluate \tetra in a warehouse-style setting, demonstrating its ability to manipulate objects in stacked and obstructed configurations. Our results show that our RL-based policy improves picking success in stacked-object scenarios by 22.86\% compared to a single-suction gripper. Additionally, we demonstrate that TetraGrip can successfully grasp objects in scenarios where a single-suction gripper fails due to physical limitations, specifically in two cases: (1) picking an object occluded by another object and (2) retrieving an object in a complex scenario. These findings highlight the advantages of multi-actuated, suction-based grasping in unstructured warehouse environments. The project website is available at: \href{this https URL}{this https URL}.

Title: Channel Estimation for Rydberg Atomic Receivers
Authors: Bokai Xu, Jiayi Zhang, Zhongtao Chen, Bingyang Cheng, Ziheng Liu, Yik-Chung Wu, Bo Ai
Abstract: The rapid development of the quantum technology presents huge opportunities for 6G communications. Leveraging the quantum properties of highly excited Rydberg atoms, Rydberg atom-based antennas present distinct advantages, such as high sensitivity, broad frequency range, and compact size, over traditional antennas. To realize efficient precoding, accurate channel state information is essential. However, due to the distinct characteristics of atomic receivers, traditional channel estimation algorithms developed for conventional receivers are no longer applicable. To this end, we propose a novel channel estimation algorithm based on projection gradient descent (PGD), which is applicable to both one-dimensional (1D) and twodimensional (2D) arrays. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of our proposed channel estimation method.

Title: Phase-mismatched STAR-RIS with FAS-assisted RSMA Users
Authors: Farshad Rostami Ghadi, Kai-Kit Wong, Masoud Kaveh, F. Javier Lopez-Martinez, Yuanwei Liu, Chan-Byoung Chae, Ross Murch
Abstract: This paper considers communication between a base station (BS) to two users, each from one side of a simultaneously transmitting-reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) in the absence of a direct link. Rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) strategy is employed and the STAR-RIS is subjected to phase errors. The users are equipped with a planar fluid antenna system (FAS) with position reconfigurability for spatial diversity. First, we derive the distribution of the equivalent channel gain at the FAS-equipped users, characterized by a t-distribution. We then obtain analytical expressions for the outage probability (OP) and average capacity (AC), with the latter obtained via a heuristic approach. Our findings highlight the potential of FAS to mitigate phase imperfections in STAR-RIS-assisted communications, significantly enhancing system performance compared to traditional antenna systems (TAS). Also, we quantify the impact of practical phase errors on system efficiency, emphasizing the importance of robust strategies for next-generation wireless networks.

Title: Traffic Regulation-aware Path Planning with Regulation Databases and Vision-Language Models
Authors: Xu Han, Zhiwen Wu, Xin Xia, Jiaqi Ma
Abstract: This paper introduces and tests a framework integrating traffic regulation compliance into automated driving systems (ADS). The framework enables ADS to follow traffic laws and make informed decisions based on the driving environment. Using RGB camera inputs and a vision-language model (VLM), the system generates descriptive text to support a regulation-aware decision-making process, ensuring legal and safe driving practices. This information is combined with a machine-readable ADS regulation database to guide future driving plans within legal constraints. Key features include: 1) a regulation database supporting ADS decision-making, 2) an automated process using sensor input for regulation-aware path planning, and 3) validation in both simulated and real-world environments. Particularly, the real-world vehicle tests not only assess the framework's performance but also evaluate the potential and challenges of VLMs to solve complex driving problems by integrating detection, reasoning, and planning. This work enhances the legality, safety, and public trust in ADS, representing a significant step forward in the field.

Title: ManeuverGPT Agentic Control for Safe Autonomous Stunt Maneuvers
Authors: Shawn Azdam, Pranav Doma, Aliasghar Moj Arab
Abstract: The next generation of active safety features in autonomous vehicles should be capable of safely executing evasive hazard-avoidance maneuvers akin to those performed by professional stunt drivers to achieve high-agility motion at the limits of vehicle handling. This paper presents a novel framework, ManeuverGPT, for generating and executing high-dynamic stunt maneuvers in autonomous vehicles using large language model (LLM)-based agents as controllers. We target aggressive maneuvers, such as J-turns, within the CARLA simulation environment and demonstrate an iterative, prompt-based approach to refine vehicle control parameters, starting tabula rasa without retraining model weights. We propose an agentic architecture comprised of three specialized agents (1) a Query Enricher Agent for contextualizing user commands, (2) a Driver Agent for generating maneuver parameters, and (3) a Parameter Validator Agent that enforces physics-based and safety constraints. Experimental results demonstrate successful J-turn execution across multiple vehicle models through textual prompts that adapt to differing vehicle dynamics. We evaluate performance via established success criteria and discuss limitations regarding numeric precision and scenario complexity. Our findings underscore the potential of LLM-driven control for flexible, high-dynamic maneuvers, while highlighting the importance of hybrid approaches that combine language-based reasoning with algorithmic validation.

Title: Incentive Analysis for Agent Participation in Federated Learning
Authors: Lihui Yi, Xiaochun Niu, Ermin Wei
Abstract: Federated learning offers a decentralized approach to machine learning, where multiple agents collaboratively train a model while preserving data privacy. In this paper, we investigate the decision-making and equilibrium behavior in federated learning systems, where agents choose between participating in global training or conducting independent local training. The problem is first modeled as a stage game and then extended to a repeated game to analyze the long-term dynamics of agent participation. For the stage game, we characterize the participation patterns and identify Nash equilibrium, revealing how data heterogeneity influences the equilibrium behavior-specifically, agents with similar data qualities will participate in FL as a group. We also derive the optimal social welfare and show that it coincides with Nash equilibrium under mild assumptions. In the repeated game, we propose a privacy-preserving, computationally efficient myopic strategy. This strategy enables agents to make practical decisions under bounded rationality and converges to a neighborhood of Nash equilibrium of the stage game in finite time. By combining theoretical insights with practical strategy design, this work provides a realistic and effective framework for guiding and analyzing agent behaviors in federated learning systems.

Title: Control Surfaces: Using the Commodore 64 and Analog Synthesizer to Expand Musical Boundaries
Authors: Daniel McKemie
Abstract: Analog-digital hybrid electronic music systems once existed out of necessity in order to facilitate a flexible work environment for the creation of live computer music. As computational power increased with the development of faster microprocessors, the need for digital functionality with analog sound production decreased, with the computer becoming more capable of handling both tasks. Given the exclusivity of these systems and the relatively short time they were in use, the possibilities of such systems were hardly explored. The work of JosÃ© Vicente Asuar best demonstrated a push for accessibility of such systems, but he never received the support of any institution in order to bring his machine widespread attention. Modeled after his approach, using a Commodore 64 (or freely available OS emulator) and analog modular hardware, this paper aims to fashion a system that is accessible, affordable, easy to use, educational, and musically rich in nature.

Title: Zero to 16383 Through the Wire: Transmitting High- Resolution MIDI with WebSockets and the Browser
Authors: Daniel McKemie
Abstract: This paper outlines how to leverage the Web MIDI API and web technologies to convert numerical data in JavaScript to Most Significant Byte and Least Significant Byte combos, stage the data as dual concurrent CC messages, use WebSockets to send it to multiple endpoints, and wire the browser to other music software. This method allows users to control their own native application via 14-bit MIDI messaging and even applications housed on a remote source. Because the technology utilizes WebSockets, it is not reliant on local networks for connectivity and opens the possibilities of remote software control and collaboration anywhere in the world. While no shortage of options exists for controlling music software from the web, the Web MIDI API allows for a more streamlined end user experience as it seamlessly links to core OS MIDI functionality. The paper will share a use case of transmitting high-resolution MIDI through the browser and translating it to control voltage data for use with a modular synthesizer.

Title: Predictor-Based Time Delay Control of A Hex-Jet Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
Authors: Junning Liang, Haowen Zheng, Yuying Zhang, Yongzhuo Gao, Wei Dong, Ximin Lyu
Abstract: Turbojet-powered VTOL UAVs have garnered increased attention in heavy-load transport and emergency services, due to their superior power density and thrust-to-weight ratio compared to existing electronic propulsion systems. The main challenge with jet-powered UAVs lies in the complexity of thrust vectoring mechanical systems, which aim to mitigate the slow dynamics of the turbojet. In this letter, we introduce a novel turbojet-powered UAV platform named Hex-Jet. Our concept integrates thrust vectoring and differential thrust for comprehensive attitude control. This approach notably simplifies the thrust vectoring mechanism. We utilize a predictor-based time delay control method based on the frequency domain model in our Hex-Jet controller design to mitigate the delay in roll attitude control caused by turbojet dynamics. Our comparative studies provide valuable insights for the UAV community, and flight tests on the scaled prototype demonstrate the successful implementation and verification of the proposed predictor-based time delay control technique.

Title: Deterministic and Statistical Analysis of the DoF of Continuous Linear Arrays in the Near Field
Authors: Athanasios G. Kanatas, Harris K. Armeniakos, Harpreet S. Dhillon, Marco Di Renzo
Abstract: This paper examines the number of communication modes, that is, the degrees of freedom (DoF), in a wireless setup comprising a small continuous linear intelligent antenna array in the near field of a large one. The framework allows for any orientations between the arrays and any positions in a two-dimensional space assuming that the transmitting array is placed at the origin. Therefore, apart from the length of the two continuous arrays, four key parameters determine the DoF and are hence considered in the analysis: the Cartesian coordinates of the center of the receiving array and two angles that model the rotation of each array around its center. The paper starts with the calculation of the deterministic DoF for a generic geometric setting, which extends beyond the widely studied paraxial case. Subsequently, a stochastic geometry framework is proposed to study the statistical DoF, as a first step towards the investigation of the system-level performance in near field networks. Numerical results applied to millimeter wave networks reveal the large number of DoF provided by near-field communications and unveiled key system-level insights.

Title: Quality Over Quantity? LLM-Based Curation for a Data-Efficient Audio-Video Foundation Model
Authors: Ali Vosoughi, Dimitra Emmanouilidou, Hannes Gamper
Abstract: Integrating audio and visual data for training multimodal foundational models remains challenging. We present Audio-Video Vector Alignment (AVVA), which aligns audiovisual (AV) scene content beyond mere temporal synchronization via a Large Language Model (LLM)-based data curation pipeline. Specifically, AVVA scores and selects high-quality training clips using Whisper (speech-based audio foundation model) for audio and DINOv2 for video within a dual-encoder contrastive learning framework. Evaluations on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound demonstrate that this approach can achieve significant accuracy gains with substantially less curated data. For instance, AVVA yields a 7.6% improvement in top-1 accuracy for audio-to-video retrieval on VGGSound compared to ImageBind, despite training on only 192 hours of carefully filtered data (vs. 5800+ hours). Moreover, an ablation study highlights that trading data quantity for data quality improves performance, yielding respective top-3 accuracy increases of 47.8, 48.4, and 58.0 percentage points on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound over uncurated baselines. While these results underscore AVVA's data efficiency, we also discuss the overhead of LLM-driven curation and how it may be scaled or approximated in larger domains. Overall, AVVA provides a viable path toward more robust, text-free audiovisual learning with improved retrieval accuracy.

Title: Large-scale Regional Traffic Signal Control Based on Single-Agent Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Qiang Li, Jin Niu, Qin Luo, Lina Yu
Abstract: In the context of global urbanization and motorization, traffic congestion has become a significant issue, severely affecting the quality of life, environment, and economy. This paper puts forward a single-agent reinforcement learning (RL)-based regional traffic signal control (TSC) model. Different from multi - agent systems, this model can coordinate traffic signals across a large area, with the goals of alleviating regional traffic congestion and minimizing the total travel time. The TSC environment is precisely defined through specific state space, action space, and reward functions. The state space consists of the current congestion state, which is represented by the queue lengths of each link, and the current signal phase scheme of intersections. The action space is designed to select an intersection first and then adjust its phase split. Two reward functions are meticulously crafted. One focuses on alleviating congestion and the other aims to minimize the total travel time while considering the congestion level. The experiments are carried out with the SUMO traffic simulation software. The performance of the TSC model is evaluated by comparing it with a base case where no signal-timing adjustments are made. The results show that the model can effectively control congestion. For example, the queuing length is significantly reduced in the scenarios tested. Moreover, when the reward is set to both alleviate congestion and minimize the total travel time, the average travel time is remarkably decreased, which indicates that the model can effectively improve traffic conditions. This research provides a new approach for large-scale regional traffic signal control and offers valuable insights for future urban traffic management.

Title: Detecting and Preventing Data Poisoning Attacks on AI Models
Authors: Halima I. Kure, Pradipta Sarkar, Ahmed B. Ndanusa, Augustine O. Nwajana
Abstract: This paper investigates the critical issue of data poisoning attacks on AI models, a growing concern in the ever-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. As advanced technology systems become increasingly prevalent across various sectors, the need for robust defence mechanisms against adversarial attacks becomes paramount. The study aims to develop and evaluate novel techniques for detecting and preventing data poisoning attacks, focusing on both theoretical frameworks and practical applications. Through a comprehensive literature review, experimental validation using the CIFAR-10 and Insurance Claims datasets, and the development of innovative algorithms, this paper seeks to enhance the resilience of AI models against malicious data manipulation. The study explores various methods, including anomaly detection, robust optimization strategies, and ensemble learning, to identify and mitigate the effects of poisoned data during model training. Experimental results indicate that data poisoning significantly degrades model performance, reducing classification accuracy by up to 27% in image recognition tasks (CIFAR-10) and 22% in fraud detection models (Insurance Claims dataset). The proposed defence mechanisms, including statistical anomaly detection and adversarial training, successfully mitigated poisoning effects, improving model robustness and restoring accuracy levels by an average of 15-20%. The findings further demonstrate that ensemble learning techniques provide an additional layer of resilience, reducing false positives and false negatives caused by adversarial data injections.

Title: Robust Fault-Tolerant Control and Agile Trajectory Planning for Modular Aerial Robotic Systems
Authors: Rui Huang, Zhenyu Zhang, Siyu Tang, Zhiqian Cai, Lin Zhao
Abstract: Modular Aerial Robotic Systems (MARS) consist of multiple drone units that can self-reconfigure to adapt to various mission requirements and fault conditions. However, existing fault-tolerant control methods exhibit significant oscillations during docking and separation, impacting system stability. To address this issue, we propose a novel fault-tolerant control reallocation method that adapts to arbitrary number of modular robots and their assembly formations. The algorithm redistributes the expected collective force and torque required for MARS to individual unit according to their moment arm relative to the center of MARS mass. Furthermore, We propose an agile trajectory planning method for MARS of arbitrary configurations, which is collision-avoiding and dynamically feasible. Our work represents the first comprehensive approach to enable fault-tolerant and collision avoidance flight for MARS. We validate our method through extensive simulations, demonstrating improved fault tolerance, enhanced trajectory tracking accuracy, and greater robustness in cluttered environments.

Title: PerCoV2: Improved Ultra-Low Bit-Rate Perceptual Image Compression with Implicit Hierarchical Masked Image Modeling
Authors: Nikolai KÃ¶rber, Eduard Kromer, Andreas Siebert, Sascha Hauke, Daniel Mueller-Gritschneder, BjÃ¶rn Schuller
Abstract: We introduce PerCoV2, a novel and open ultra-low bit-rate perceptual image compression system designed for bandwidth- and storage-constrained applications. Building upon prior work by Careil et al., PerCoV2 extends the original formulation to the Stable Diffusion 3 ecosystem and enhances entropy coding efficiency by explicitly modeling the discrete hyper-latent image distribution. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of recent autoregressive methods (VAR and MaskGIT) for entropy modeling and evaluate our approach on the large-scale MSCOCO-30k benchmark. Compared to previous work, PerCoV2 (i) achieves higher image fidelity at even lower bit-rates while maintaining competitive perceptual quality, (ii) features a hybrid generation mode for further bit-rate savings, and (iii) is built solely on public components. Code and trained models will be released at this https URL.

Title: Robust Self-Reconfiguration for Fault-Tolerant Control of Modular Aerial Robot Systems
Authors: Rui Huang, Siyu Tang, Zhiqian Cai, Lin Zhao
Abstract: Modular Aerial Robotic Systems (MARS) consist of multiple drone units assembled into a single, integrated rigid flying platform. With inherent redundancy, MARS can self-reconfigure into different configurations to mitigate rotor or unit failures and maintain stable flight. However, existing works on MARS self-reconfiguration often overlook the practical controllability of intermediate structures formed during the reassembly process, which limits their applicability. In this paper, we address this gap by considering the control-constrained dynamic model of MARS and proposing a robust and efficient self-reconstruction algorithm that maximizes the controllability margin at each intermediate stage. Specifically, we develop algorithms to compute optimal, controllable disassembly and assembly sequences, enabling robust self-reconfiguration. Finally, we validate our method in several challenging fault-tolerant self-reconfiguration scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in both controllability and trajectory tracking while reducing the number of assembly steps.

Title: PCLA: A Framework for Testing Autonomous Agents in the CARLA Simulator
Authors: Masoud Jamshidiyan Tehrani, Jinhan Kim, Paolo Tonella
Abstract: Recent research on testing autonomous driving agents has grown significantly, especially in simulation environments. The CARLA simulator is often the preferred choice, and the autonomous agents from the CARLA Leaderboard challenge are regarded as the best-performing agents within this environment. However, researchers who test these agents, rather than training their own ones from scratch, often face challenges in utilizing them within customized test environments and scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce PCLA (Pretrained CARLA Leaderboard Agents), an open-source Python testing framework that includes nine high-performing pre-trained autonomous agents from the Leaderboard challenges. PCLA is the first infrastructure specifically designed for testing various autonomous agents in arbitrary CARLA environments/scenarios. PCLA provides a simple way to deploy Leaderboard agents onto a vehicle without relying on the Leaderboard codebase, it allows researchers to easily switch between agents without requiring modifications to CARLA versions or programming environments, and it is fully compatible with the latest version of CARLA while remaining independent of the Leaderboard's specific CARLA version. PCLA is publicly accessible at this https URL.

Title: Neural-Augmented Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion for Quadrotors with Payload Adaptation
Authors: Eckart Cobo-Briesewitz, Khaled Wahba, Wolfgang HÃ¶nig
Abstract: The increasing complexity of multirotor applications has led to the need of more accurate flight controllers that can reliably predict all forces acting on the robot. Traditional flight controllers model a large part of the forces but do not take so called residual forces into account. A reason for this is that accurately computing the residual forces can be computationally expensive. Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI) is a method that computes the difference between different sensor measurements in order to estimate these residual forces. The main issue with INDI is it's reliance on special sensor measurements which can be very noisy. Recent work has also shown that residual forces can be predicted using learning-based methods. In this work, we demonstrate that a learning algorithm can predict a smoother version of INDI outputs without requiring additional sensor measurements. In addition, we introduce a new method that combines learning based predictions with INDI. We also adapt the two approaches to work on quadrotors carrying a slung-type payload. The results show that using a neural network to predict residual forces can outperform INDI while using the combination of neural network and INDI can yield even better results than each method individually.

Title: Fast computation of the TGOSPA metric for multiple target tracking via unbalanced optimal transport
Authors: Viktor Nevelius Wernholm, Alfred WÃ¤rnsÃ¤ter, Axel Ringh
Abstract: In multiple target tracking, it is important to be able to evaluate the performance of different tracking algorithms. The trajectory generalized optimal sub-pattern assignment metric (TGOSPA) is a recently proposed metric for such evaluations. The TGOSPA metric is computed as the solution to an optimization problem, but for large tracking scenarios, solving this problem becomes computationally demanding. In this paper, we present an approximation algorithm for evaluating the TGOSPA metric, based on casting the TGOSPA problem as an unbalanced multimarginal optimal transport problem. Following recent advances in computational optimal transport, we introduce an entropy regularization and derive an iterative scheme for solving the Lagrangian dual of the regularized problem. Numerical results suggest that our proposed algorithm is more computationally efficient than the alternative of computing the exact metric using a linear programming solver, while still providing an adequate approximation of the metric.

Title: Optimal ISAC Beamforming Structure and Efficient Algorithms for Sum Rate and CRLB Balancing
Authors: Tianyu Fang, Mengyuan Ma, Markku Juntti, Nir Shlezinger, A. Lee Swindlehurst, Nhan Thanh Nguyen
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has emerged as a promising paradigm to unify wireless communications and radar sensing, enabling efficient spectrum and hardware utilization. A core challenge with realizing the gains of ISAC stems from the unique challenges of dual purpose beamforming design due to the highly non-convex nature of key performance metrics such as sum rate for communications and the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for sensing. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity structured approach to ISAC beamforming optimization to simultaneously enhance spectral efficiency and estimation accuracy. Specifically, we develop a successive convex approximation (SCA) based algorithm which transforms the original non-convex problem into a sequence of convex subproblems ensuring convergence to a locally optimal solution. Furthermore, leveraging the proposed SCA framework and the Lagrange duality, we derive the optimal beamforming structure for CRLB optimization in ISAC systems. Our findings characterize the reduction in radar streams one can employ without affecting performance. This enables a dimensionality reduction that enhances computational efficiency. Numerical simulations validate that our approach achieves comparable or superior performance to the considered benchmarks while requiring much lower computational costs.

Title: DAMM-Diffusion: Learning Divergence-Aware Multi-Modal Diffusion Model for Nanoparticles Distribution Prediction
Authors: Junjie Zhou, Shouju Wang, Yuxia Tang, Qi Zhu, Daoqiang Zhang, Wei Shao
Abstract: The prediction of nanoparticles (NPs) distribution is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of tumors. Recent studies indicate that the heterogeneity of tumor microenvironment (TME) highly affects the distribution of NPs across tumors. Hence, it has become a research hotspot to generate the NPs distribution by the aid of multi-modal TME components. However, the distribution divergence among multi-modal TME components may cause side effects i.e., the best uni-modal model may outperform the joint generative model. To address the above issues, we propose a \textbf{D}ivergence-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{Diffusion} model (i.e., \textbf{DAMM-Diffusion}) to adaptively generate the prediction results from uni-modal and multi-modal branches in a unified network. In detail, the uni-modal branch is composed of the U-Net architecture while the multi-modal branch extends it by introducing two novel fusion modules i.e., Multi-Modal Fusion Module (MMFM) and Uncertainty-Aware Fusion Module (UAFM). Specifically, the MMFM is proposed to fuse features from multiple modalities, while the UAFM module is introduced to learn the uncertainty map for cross-attention computation. Following the individual prediction results from each branch, the Divergence-Aware Multi-Modal Predictor (DAMMP) module is proposed to assess the consistency of multi-modal data with the uncertainty map, which determines whether the final prediction results come from multi-modal or uni-modal predictions. We predict the NPs distribution given the TME components of tumor vessels and cell nuclei, and the experimental results show that DAMM-Diffusion can generate the distribution of NPs with higher accuracy than the comparing methods. Additional results on the multi-modal brain image synthesis task further validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: GenHPE: Generative Counterfactuals for 3D Human Pose Estimation with Radio Frequency Signals
Authors: Shuokang Huang, Julie A. McCann
Abstract: Human pose estimation (HPE) detects the positions of human body joints for various applications. Compared to using cameras, HPE using radio frequency (RF) signals is non-intrusive and more robust to adverse conditions, exploiting the signal variations caused by human interference. However, existing studies focus on single-domain HPE confined by domain-specific confounders, which cannot generalize to new domains and result in diminished HPE performance. Specifically, the signal variations caused by different human body parts are entangled, containing subject-specific confounders. RF signals are also intertwined with environmental noise, involving environment-specific confounders. In this paper, we propose GenHPE, a 3D HPE approach that generates counterfactual RF signals to eliminate domain-specific confounders. GenHPE trains generative models conditioned on human skeleton labels, learning how human body parts and confounders interfere with RF signals. We manipulate skeleton labels (i.e., removing body parts) as counterfactual conditions for generative models to synthesize counterfactual RF signals. The differences between counterfactual signals approximately eliminate domain-specific confounders and regularize an encoder-decoder model to learn domain-independent representations. Such representations help GenHPE generalize to new subjects/environments for cross-domain 3D HPE. We evaluate GenHPE on three public datasets from WiFi, ultra-wideband, and millimeter wave. Experimental results show that GenHPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods and reduces estimation errors by up to 52.2mm for cross-subject HPE and 10.6mm for cross-environment HPE.

Title: Intelligent Reflecting Surface Enhanced Resilient Design for MEC Offloading over Millimeter Wave Links
Authors: Yashuai Cao, Tiejun Lv
Abstract: The merge of mobile edge computing (MEC) and millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications will hopefully enable the fast access for computational resources, where these two technologies can benefit from each other's potentials. However, the high susceptibility to blocking in mmWave networks imposes crucial challenges for further development of mmWave-MEC vision. In this paper, a novel intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted mmWave-MEC scheme is proposed to overcome the disruptive effect caused by blockage events. In this context, we investigate new methods to minimize mobile power for a multi-user mmWave-MEC system, thus efficiently orchestrating the uplink mobile power resources for latency-constrained computation offloading. In particular, the mobile power is optimized by joint design of individual device power, multi-user detection matrix and passive beamforming. To tackle this issue, we develop an alternating optimization framework so that the joint optimization can be decomposed into tractable subproblems. First, we provide closed-form expressions for the update of powers and multi-user detection vectors in each iteration step. Then, we reformulate the passive beamforming problem. To cater for large-scale IRS scenario, we propose two efficient algorithms including complex circle manifold optimization (CCMO) method and sum-of-inverse minimization (SIMin) fraction transform based alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method. Finally, numerical results corroborate the merits of our proposed IRS assisted mmWave-MEC scheme, and demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our algorithms.

Title: Sum Rate Maximization for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Assisted Device-to-Device Communications
Authors: Yashuai Cao, Tiejun Lv
Abstract: In this letter, we propose to employ reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) for enhancing the D2D underlaying system performance. We study the joint power control, receive beamforming, and passive beamforming for RIS assisted D2D underlaying cellular communication systems, which is formulated as a sum rate maximization problem. To address this issue, we develop a block coordinate descent method where uplink power, receive beamformer and refection phase shifts are alternatively optimized. Then, we provide the closed-form solutions for both uplink power and receive beamformer. We further propose a quadratic transform based semi-definite relaxation algorithm to optimize the RIS phase shifts, where the original passive beamforming problem is translated into a separable quadratically constrained quadratic problem. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RIS assisted design significantly improves the sum-rate performance.

Title: Input-Output Feedback Linearization Preserving Task Priority for Multivariate Nonlinear Systems Having Singular Input Gain Matrix
Authors: Sang-ik An, Dongheui Lee, Gyunghoon Park
Abstract: We propose an extension of the input-output feedback linearization for a class of multivariate systems that are not input-output linearizable in a classical manner. The key observation is that the usual input-output linearization problem can be interpreted as the problem of solving simultaneous linear equations associated with the input gain matrix: thus, even at points where the input gain matrix becomes singular, it is still possible to solve a part of linear equations, by which a subset of input-output relations is made linear or close to be linear. Based on this observation, we adopt the task priority-based approach in the input-output linearization problem. First, we generalize the classical Byrnes-Isidori normal form to a prioritized normal form having a triangular structure, so that the singularity of a subblock of the input gain matrix related to lower-priority tasks does not directly propagate to higher-priority tasks. Next, we present a prioritized input-output linearization via the multi-objective optimization with the lexicographical ordering, resulting in a prioritized semilinear form that establishes input output relations whose subset with higher priority is linear or close to be linear. Finally, Lyapunov analysis on ultimate boundedness and task achievement is provided, particularly when the proposed prioritized input-output linearization is applied to the output tracking problem. This work introduces a new control framework for complex systems having critical and noncritical control issues, by assigning higher priority to the critical ones.

Title: RRWNet: Recursive Refinement Network for effective retinal artery/vein segmentation and classification
Authors: JosÃ© Morano, Guilherme Aresta, Hrvoje BogunoviÄ
Abstract: The caliber and configuration of retinal blood vessels serve as important biomarkers for various diseases and medical conditions. A thorough analysis of the retinal vasculature requires the segmentation of the blood vessels and their classification into arteries and veins, typically performed on color fundus images obtained by retinography. However, manually performing these tasks is labor-intensive and prone to human error. While several automated methods have been proposed to address this task, the current state of art faces challenges due to manifest classification errors affecting the topological consistency of segmentation maps. In this work, we introduce RRWNet, a novel end-to-end deep learning framework that addresses this limitation. The framework consists of a fully convolutional neural network that recursively refines semantic segmentation maps, correcting manifest classification errors and thus improving topological consistency. In particular, RRWNet is composed of two specialized subnetworks: a Base subnetwork that generates base segmentation maps from the input images, and a Recursive Refinement subnetwork that iteratively and recursively improves these maps. Evaluation on three different public datasets demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method, yielding more topologically consistent segmentation maps with fewer manifest classification errors than existing approaches. In addition, the Recursive Refinement module within RRWNet proves effective in post-processing segmentation maps from other methods, further demonstrating its potential. The model code, weights, and predictions will be publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Optimizing tiny colorless feedback delay networks
Authors: Gloria Dal Santo, Karolina Prawda, Sebastian J. Schlecht, Vesa VÃ¤limÃ¤ki
Abstract: A common bane of artificial reverberation algorithms is spectral coloration in the synthesized sound, typically manifesting as metallic ringing, leading to a degradation in the perceived sound quality. In delay network methods, coloration is more pronounced when fewer delay lines are used. This paper presents an optimization framework in which a tiny differentiable feedback delay network, with as few as four delay lines, is used to learn a set of parameters to iteratively reduce coloration. The parameters under optimization include the feedback matrix, as well as the input and output gains. The optimization objective is twofold: to maximize spectral flatness through a spectral loss while maintaining temporal density by penalizing sparseness in the parameter values. A favorable narrow distribution of modal excitation is achieved while maintaining the desired impulse response density. In a subjective assessment, the new method proves effective in reducing perceptual coloration of late reverberation. Compared to the author's previous work, which serves as the baseline and utilizes a sparsity loss in the time domain, the proposed method achieves computational savings while maintaining performance. The effectiveness of this work is demonstrated through two application scenarios where smooth-sounding synthetic room impulse responses are obtained via the introduction of attenuation filters and an optimizable scattering feedback matrix.

Title: CommonPower: A Framework for Safe Data-Driven Smart Grid Control
Authors: Michael Eichelbeck, Hannah Markgraf, Matthias Althoff
Abstract: The growing complexity of power system management has led to an increased interest in reinforcement learning (RL). To validate their effectiveness, RL algorithms have to be evaluated across multiple case studies. Case study design is an arduous task requiring the consideration of many aspects, among them the influence of available forecasts and the level of decentralization in the control structure. Furthermore, vanilla RL controllers cannot themselves ensure the satisfaction of system constraints, which makes devising a safeguarding mechanism a necessary task for every case study before deploying the system. To address these shortcomings, we introduce the Python tool CommonPower, the first general framework for the modeling and simulation of power system management tailored towards machine learning. Its modular architecture enables users to focus on specific elements without having to implement a simulation environment. Another unique contribution of CommonPower is the automatic synthesis of model predictive controllers and safeguards. Beyond offering a unified interface for single-agent RL, multi-agent RL, and optimal control, CommonPower includes a training pipeline for machine-learning-based forecasters as well as a flexible mechanism for incorporating feedback of safeguards into the learning updates of RL controllers.

Title: Advancing Ubiquitous Wireless Connectivity through Channel Twinning
Authors: Yashuai Cao, Linglong Dai, Jingbo Tan, Jintao Wang, Tianyue Zheng, Wei Ni, Ekram Hossain, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: As an emerging trend in channel acquisition (CA), the concept of channel twinning (CT) has been proposed as a powerful enabler of ubiquitous connectivity in next-generation (xG) wireless systems. By fusing multimodal sensor data, CT advocates a high-fidelity and low-overhead CA paradigm, which is promising to provide accurate channel prediction in cross-domain and high-mobility scenarios of ubiquitous xG networks. However, existing literature lacks a universal CT architecture to address the challenges of heterogeneous scenarios, data, and resources in xG networks, which hinders the widespread deployment and applications of CT. This article discusses a new modularized CT architecture to bridge scene recognition, cooperative sensing, and decentralized training, comprising versatile model configuration, multimodal cooperative sensing, and lightweight twin modeling modules. Additionally, this article presents a detailed concept, technical features, and case studies of CT, outlines mainstream trends of realization methods, followed by potential applications of CT-empowered ubiquitous connectivity, and issues requiring future investigations.

Title: Unrolling Plug-and-Play Gradient Graph Laplacian Regularizer for Image Restoration
Authors: Jianghe Cai, Gene Cheung, Fei Chen
Abstract: Generic deep learning (DL) networks for image restoration like denoising and interpolation lack mathematical interpretability, require voluminous training data to tune a large parameter set, and are fragile in the face of covariate shift. To address these shortcomings, we build interpretable networks by unrolling variants of a graph-based optimization algorithm of different complexities. Specifically, for a general linear image formation model, we first formulate a convex quadratic programming (QP) problem with a new $\ell_2$-norm graph smoothness prior called gradient graph Laplacian regularizer (GGLR) that promotes piecewise planar (PWP) signal reconstruction. To solve the posed unconstrained QP problem, instead of computing a linear system solution straightforwardly, we introduce a variable number of auxiliary variables and correspondingly design a family of ADMM algorithms. We then unroll them into variable-complexity feed-forward networks, amenable to parameter tuning via back-propagation. More complex unrolled networks require more labeled data to train more parameters, but have better overall performance. The unrolled networks have periodic insertions of a graph learning module, akin to a self-attention mechanism in a transformer architecture, to learn pairwise similarity structure inherent in data. Experimental results show that our unrolled networks perform competitively to generic DL networks in image restoration quality while using only a fraction of parameters, and demonstrate improved robustness to covariate shift.

Title: A Marginal Distributionally Robust Kalman Filter for Centralized Fusion
Authors: Weizhi Chen, Yaowen Li, Yu Liu, You He
Abstract: State estimation is a fundamental problem for multi-sensor information fusion, essential in applications such as target tracking, power systems, and control automation. Previous research mostly ignores the correlation between sensors and assumes independent or known distributions. However, in practice, these distributions are often correlated and difAcult to estimate. This paper proposes a novel moment constrained marginal distributionally robust Kalman Alter (MC-MDRKF) for centralized state estimation in multi-sensor systems. First, we introduce a marginal distributional uncertainty set using a moment-constrained approach, which can better capture the uncertainties of Gaussian noises compared to Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based methods. Based on that, a minimax optimization problem is formulated to identify the least favorable joint distribution and the optimal MMSE estimator thereunder. It is proved that this problem can be reformulated as a convex optimization problem, allowing for efficient solution Anding. Subsequently, by accounting for marginal distributional uncertainty within the state space model, the proposed MC-MDRKF is devised in a minimax approach. Simulation result demonstrates the robustness and superiority of the proposed method in a multi-sensor target tracking scenario.

Title: Beyond the Eye: A Relational Model for Early Dementia Detection Using Retinal OCTA Images
Authors: Shouyue Liu, Ziyi Zhang, Yuanyuan Gu, Jinkui Hao, Yonghuai Liu, Huazhu Fu, Xinyu Guo, Hong Song, Shuting Zhang, Yitian Zhao
Abstract: Early detection of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is essential to enable timely intervention and potential treatment. Accurate detection of AD/MCI is challenging due to the high complexity, cost, and often invasive nature of current diagnostic techniques, which limit their suitability for large-scale population screening. Given the shared embryological origins and physiological characteristics of the retina and brain, retinal imaging is emerging as a potentially rapid and cost-effective alternative for the identification of individuals with or at high risk of AD. In this paper, we present a novel PolarNet+ that uses retinal optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) to discriminate early-onset AD (EOAD) and MCI subjects from controls. Our method first maps OCTA images from Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates, allowing approximate sub-region calculation to implement the clinician-friendly early treatment of diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) grid analysis. We then introduce a multi-view module to serialize and analyze the images along three dimensions for comprehensive, clinically useful information extraction. Finally, we abstract the sequence embedding into a graph, transforming the detection task into a general graph classification problem. A regional relationship module is applied after the multi-view module to excavate the relationship between the sub-regions. Such regional relationship analyses validate known eye-brain links and reveal new discriminative patterns.

Abstract: Efficient point cloud coding has become increasingly critical for multiple applications such as virtual reality, autonomous driving, and digital twin systems, where rich and interactive 3D data representations may functionally make the difference. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool in this domain, offering advanced techniques for compressing point clouds more efficiently than conventional coding methods while also allowing effective computer vision tasks performed in the compressed domain thus, for the first time, making available a common compressed visual representation effective for both man and machine. Taking advantage of this potential, JPEG has recently finalized the JPEG Pleno Learning-based Point Cloud Coding (PCC) standard offering efficient lossy coding of static point clouds, targeting both human visualization and machine processing by leveraging deep learning models for geometry and color coding. The geometry is processed directly in its original 3D form using sparse convolutional neural networks, while the color data is projected onto 2D images and encoded using the also learning-based JPEG AI standard. The goal of this paper is to provide a complete technical description of the JPEG PCC standard, along with a thorough benchmarking of its performance against the state-of-the-art, while highlighting its main strengths and weaknesses. In terms of compression performance, JPEG PCC outperforms the conventional MPEG PCC standards, especially in geometry coding, achieving significant rate reductions. Color compression performance is less competitive but this is overcome by the power of a full learning-based coding framework for both geometry and color and the associated effective compressed domain processing.

Title: Construction of the Sparsest Maximally $r$-Robust Graphs
Authors: Haejoon Lee, Dimitra Panagou
Abstract: In recent years, the notion of r-robustness for the communication graph of the network has been introduced to address the challenge of achieving consensus in the presence of misbehaving agents. Higher r-robustness typically implies higher tolerance to malicious information towards achieving resilient consensus, but it also implies more edges for the communication graph. This in turn conflicts with the need to minimize communication due to limited resources in real-world applications (e.g., multi-robot networks). In this paper, our contributions are twofold. (a) We provide the necessary subgraph structures and tight lower bounds on the number of edges required for graphs with a given number of nodes to achieve maximum robustness. (b) We then use the results of (a) to introduce two classes of graphs that maintain maximum robustness with the least number of edges. Our work is validated through a series of simulations.

Title: Koopman Spectral Analysis from Noisy Measurements based on Bayesian Learning and Kalman Smoothing
Authors: Zhexuan Zeng, Jun Zhou, Yasen Wang, Zuowei Ping
Abstract: Koopman spectral analysis plays a crucial role in understanding and modeling nonlinear dynamical systems as it reveals key system behaviors and long-term dynamics. However, the presence of measurement noise poses a significant challenge to accurately extracting spectral properties. In this work, we propose a robust method for identifying the Koopman operator and extracting its spectral characteristics in noisy environments. To address the impact of noise, our approach tackles an identification problem that accounts for both systematic errors from finite-dimensional approximations and measurement noise in the data. By incorporating Bayesian learning and Kalman smoothing, the method simultaneously identifies the Koopman operator and estimates system states, effectively decoupling these two error sources. The method's efficiency and robustness are demonstrated through extensive experiments, showcasing its accuracy across varying noise levels.

Title: Synthio: Augmenting Small-Scale Audio Classification Datasets with Synthetic Data
Authors: Sreyan Ghosh, Sonal Kumar, Zhifeng Kong, Rafael Valle, Bryan Catanzaro, Dinesh Manocha
Abstract: We present Synthio, a novel approach for augmenting small-scale audio classification datasets with synthetic data. Our goal is to improve audio classification accuracy with limited labeled data. Traditional data augmentation techniques, which apply artificial transformations (e.g., adding random noise or masking segments), struggle to create data that captures the true diversity present in real-world audios. To address this shortcoming, we propose to augment the dataset with synthetic audio generated from text-to-audio (T2A) diffusion models. However, synthesizing effective augmentations is challenging because not only should the generated data be acoustically consistent with the underlying small-scale dataset, but they should also have sufficient compositional diversity. To overcome the first challenge, we align the generations of the T2A model with the small-scale dataset using preference optimization. This ensures that the acoustic characteristics of the generated data remain consistent with the small-scale dataset. To address the second challenge, we propose a novel caption generation technique that leverages the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models to (1) generate diverse and meaningful audio captions and (2) iteratively refine their quality. The generated captions are then used to prompt the aligned T2A model. We extensively evaluate Synthio on ten datasets and four simulated limited-data settings. Results indicate our method consistently outperforms all baselines by 0.1%-39% using a T2A model trained only on weakly-captioned AudioSet.

Title: DAWN-FM: Data-Aware and Noise-Informed Flow Matching for Solving Inverse Problems
Authors: Shadab Ahamed, Eldad Haber
Abstract: Inverse problems, which involve estimating parameters from incomplete or noisy observations, arise in various fields such as medical imaging, geophysics, and signal processing. These problems are often ill-posed, requiring regularization techniques to stabilize the solution. In this work, we employ Flow Matching (FM), a generative framework that integrates a deterministic processes to map a simple reference distribution, such as a Gaussian, to the target distribution. Our method DAWN-FM: Data-AWare and Noise-informed Flow Matching incorporates data and noise embedding, allowing the model to access representations about the measured data explicitly and also account for noise in the observations, making it particularly robust in scenarios where data is noisy or incomplete. By learning a time-dependent velocity field, FM not only provides accurate solutions but also enables uncertainty quantification by generating multiple plausible outcomes. Unlike pre-trained diffusion models, which may struggle in highly ill-posed settings, our approach is trained specifically for each inverse problem and adapts to varying noise levels. We validate the effectiveness and robustness of our method through extensive numerical experiments on tasks such as image deblurring and tomography.

Title: Generalized and Efficient 2D Gaussian Splatting for Arbitrary-scale Super-Resolution
Authors: Du Chen, Liyi Chen, Zhengqiang Zhang, Lei Zhang
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has been successfully employed for Arbitrary-scale Super-Resolution (ASR). However, INR-based models need to query the multi-layer perceptron module numerous times and render a pixel in each query, resulting in insufficient representation capability and computational efficiency. Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown its advantages over INR in both visual quality and rendering speed in 3D tasks, which motivates us to explore whether GS can be employed for the ASR task. However, directly applying GS to ASR is exceptionally challenging because the original GS is an optimization-based method through overfitting each single scene, while in ASR we aim to learn a single model that can generalize to different images and scaling factors. We overcome these challenges by developing two novel techniques. Firstly, to generalize GS for ASR, we elaborately design an architecture to predict the corresponding image-conditioned Gaussians of the input low-resolution image in a feed-forward manner. Each Gaussian can fit the shape and direction of an area of complex textures, showing powerful representation capability. Secondly, we implement an efficient differentiable 2D GPU/CUDA-based scale-aware rasterization to render super-resolved images by sampling discrete RGB values from the predicted continuous Gaussians. Via end-to-end training, our optimized network, namely GSASR, can perform ASR for any image and unseen scaling factors. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Title: OpenGERT: Open Source Automated Geometry Extraction with Geometric and Electromagnetic Sensitivity Analyses for Ray-Tracing Propagation Models
Authors: Serhat Tadik, Rajib Bhattacharjea, Johnathan Corgan, David Johnson, Jacobus Van der Merwe, Gregory D. Durgin
Abstract: Accurate RF propagation modeling in urban environments is critical for developing digital spectrum twins and optimizing wireless communication systems. We introduce OpenGERT, an open-source automated Geometry Extraction tool for Ray Tracing, which collects and processes terrain and building data from OpenStreetMap, Microsoft Global ML Building Footprints, and USGS elevation data. Using the Blender Python API, it creates detailed urban models for high-fidelity simulations with NVIDIA Sionna RT. We perform sensitivity analyses to examine how variations in building height, position, and electromagnetic material properties affect ray-tracing accuracy. Specifically, we present pairwise dispersion plots of channel statistics (path gain, mean excess delay, delay spread, link outage, and Rician K-factor) and investigate how their sensitivities change with distance from transmitters. We also visualize the variance of these statistics for selected transmitter locations to gain deeper insights. Our study covers Munich and Etoile scenes, each with 10 transmitter locations. For each location, we apply five types of perturbations: material, position, height, height-position, and all combined, with 50 perturbations each. Results show that small changes in permittivity and conductivity minimally affect channel statistics, whereas variations in building height and position significantly alter all statistics, even with noise standard deviations of 1 meter in height and 0.4 meters in position. These findings highlight the importance of precise environmental modeling for accurate propagation predictions, essential for digital spectrum twins and advanced communication networks. The code for geometry extraction and sensitivity analyses is available at this http URL.

Title: Polyhedra Encoding Transformers: Enhancing Diffusion MRI Analysis Beyond Voxel and Volumetric Embedding
Authors: Tianyuan Yao, Zhiyuan Li, Praitayini Kanakaraj, Derek B. Archer, Kurt Schilling, Lori Beason-Held, Susan Resnick, Bennett A. Landman, Yuankai Huo
Abstract: Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) is an essential tool in neuroimaging. It is arguably the sole noninvasive technique for examining the microstructural properties and structural connectivity of the brain. Recent years have seen the emergence of machine learning and data-driven approaches that enhance the speed, accuracy, and consistency of dMRI data analysis. However, traditional deep learning models often fell short, as they typically utilize pixel-level or volumetric patch-level embeddings similar to those used in structural MRI, and do not account for the unique distribution of various gradient encodings. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Polyhedra Encoding Transformer (PE-Transformer) for dMRI, designed specifically to handle spherical signals. Our approach involves projecting an icosahedral polygon onto a unit sphere to resample signals from predetermined directions. These resampled signals are then transformed into embeddings, which are processed by a transformer encoder that incorporates orientational information reflective of the icosahedral structure. Through experimental validation with various gradient encoding protocols, our method demonstrates superior accuracy in estimating multi-compartment models and Fiber Orientation Distributions (FOD), outperforming both conventional CNN architectures and standard transformers.

Title: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts for Non-Uniform Noise Reduction in MRI Images
Authors: Zeyun Deng, Joseph Campbell
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is an essential diagnostic tool in clinical settings but its utility is often hindered by noise artifacts introduced during the imaging process. Effective denoising is critical for enhancing image quality while preserving anatomical structures. However traditional denoising methods which typically assume uniform noise distributions struggle to handle the non-uniform noise commonly present in MRI images. In this paper we introduce a novel approach leveraging a sparse mixture-of-experts framework for MRI image denoising. Each expert is a specialized denoising convolutional neural network fine-tuned to target specific noise characteristics associated with different image regions. Our method demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art denoising techniques on both synthetic and real-world MRI datasets. Furthermore we show that it generalizes effectively to unseen datasets highlighting its robustness and adaptability.

Title: Cell-Free Integrated Sensing and Communication: Principles, Advances, and Future Directions
Authors: Diluka Galappaththige, Mohammadali Mohammadi, Gayan Aruma Baduge, Chintha Tellambura
Abstract: Cell-free (CF) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) combines CF architecture with ISAC. CF employs distributed access points, eliminates cell boundaries, and enhances coverage, spectral efficiency, and reliability. ISAC unifies radar sensing and communication, enabling simultaneous data transmission and environmental sensing within shared spectral and hardware resources. CF-ISAC leverages these strengths to improve spectral and energy efficiency while enhancing sensing in wireless networks. As a promising candidate for next-generation wireless systems, CF-ISAC supports robust multi-user communication, distributed multi-static sensing, and seamless resource optimization. However, a comprehensive survey on CF-ISAC has been lacking. This paper fills that gap by first revisiting CF and ISAC principles, covering cooperative transmission, radar cross-section, target parameter estimation, ISAC integration levels, sensing metrics, and applications. It then explores CF-ISAC systems, emphasizing their unique features and the benefits of multi-static sensing. State-of-the-art developments are categorized into performance analysis, resource allocation, security, and user/target-centric designs, offering a thorough literature review and case studies. Finally, the paper identifies key challenges such as synchronization, multi-target detection, interference management, and fronthaul capacity and latency. Emerging trends, including next-generation antenna technologies, network-assisted systems, near-field CF-ISAC, integration with other technologies, and machine learning approaches, are highlighted to outline the future trajectory of CF-ISAC research.

Title: Automated Retinal Layer and Fluid Segmentation and Cross-sectional Analysis using Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography Images for Diabetic Retinopathy
Authors: S. Chen, D. Ma, M. Raviselvan, S. Sundaramoorthy, K. Popuri, M. J. Ju, M. V. Sarunic, D. Ratra, M. F. Beg
Abstract: This study presents an AI-driven pipeline for automated retinal segmentation and thickness analysis in diabetic retinopathy (DR) using SD-OCT imaging. A deep neural network was trained to segment ten retinal layers, intra-retinal fluid, and hyperreflective foci (HRF), with performance evaluated across multiple architectures. SwinUNETR achieved the highest segmentation accuracy, while VM-Unet excelled in specific layers. Analysis revealed distinct thickness variations between NPDR and PDR, with correlations between layer thickness and visual acuity. The proposed method enhances DR assessment by reducing manual annotation effort and providing clinically relevant thickness maps for disease monitoring and treatment planning.

Title: Lightweight Hypercomplex MRI Reconstruction: A Generalized Kronecker-Parameterized Approach
Authors: Haosen Zhang, Jiahao Huang, Yinzhe Wu, Congren Dai, Fanwen Wang, Zhenxuan Zhang, Guang Yang
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is crucial for clinical diagnostics but is hindered by prolonged scan times. Current deep learning models enhance MRI reconstruction but are often memory-intensive and unsuitable for resource-limited systems. This paper introduces a lightweight MRI reconstruction model leveraging Kronecker-Parameterized Hypercomplex Neural Networks to achieve high performance with reduced parameters. By integrating Kronecker-based modules, including Kronecker MLP, Kronecker Window Attention, and Kronecker Convolution, the proposed model efficiently extracts spatial features while preserving representational power. We introduce Kronecker U-Net and Kronecker SwinMR, which maintain high reconstruction quality with approximately 50% fewer parameters compared to existing models. Experimental evaluation on the FastMRI dataset demonstrates competitive PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, even at high acceleration factors (8x and 16x), with no significant performance drop. Additionally, Kronecker variants exhibit superior generalization and reduced overfitting on limited datasets, facilitating efficient MRI reconstruction on hardware-constrained systems. This approach sets a new benchmark for parameter-efficient medical imaging models.

Title: L-FUSION: Laplacian Fetal Ultrasound Segmentation & Uncertainty Estimation
Authors: Johanna P. MÃ¼ller, Robert Wright, Thomas G. Day, Lorenzo Venturini, Samuel F. Budd, Hadrien Reynaud, Joseph V. Hajnal, Reza Razavi, Bernhard Kainz
Abstract: Accurate analysis of prenatal ultrasound (US) is essential for early detection of developmental anomalies. However, operator dependency and technical limitations (e.g. intrinsic artefacts and effects, setting errors) can complicate image interpretation and the assessment of diagnostic uncertainty. We present L-FUSION (Laplacian Fetal US Segmentation with Integrated FoundatiON models), a framework that integrates uncertainty quantification through unsupervised, normative learning and large-scale foundation models for robust segmentation of fetal structures in normal and pathological scans. We propose to utilise the aleatoric logit distributions of Stochastic Segmentation Networks and Laplace approximations with fast Hessian estimations to estimate epistemic uncertainty only from the segmentation head. This enables us to achieve reliable abnormality quantification for instant diagnostic feedback. Combined with an integrated Dropout component, L-FUSION enables reliable differentiation of lesions from normal fetal anatomy with enhanced uncertainty maps and segmentation counterfactuals in US imaging. It improves epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty interpretation and removes the need for manual disease-labelling. Evaluations across multiple datasets show that L-FUSION achieves superior segmentation accuracy and consistent uncertainty quantification, supporting on-site decision-making and offering a scalable solution for advancing fetal ultrasound analysis in clinical settings.

Title: An Unsupervised C-Uniform Trajectory Sampler with Applications to Model Predictive Path Integral Control
Authors: O. Goktug Poyrazoglu, Rahul Moorthy, Yukang Cao, William Chastek, Volkan Isler
Abstract: Sampling-based model predictive controllers generate trajectories by sampling control inputs from a fixed, simple distribution such as the normal or uniform distributions. This sampling method yields trajectory samples that are tightly clustered around a mean trajectory. This clustering behavior in turn, limits the exploration capability of the controller and reduces the likelihood of finding feasible solutions in complex environments. Recent work has attempted to address this problem by either reshaping the resulting trajectory distribution or increasing the sample entropy to enhance diversity and promote exploration. In our recent work, we introduced the concept of C-Uniform trajectory generation [1] which allows the computation of control input probabilities to generate trajectories that sample the configuration space uniformly. In this work, we first address the main limitation of this method: lack of scalability due to computational complexity. We introduce Neural C-Uniform, an unsupervised C-Uniform trajectory sampler that mitigates scalability issues by computing control input probabilities without relying on a discretized configuration space. Experiments show that Neural C-Uniform achieves a similar uniformity ratio to the original C-Uniform approach and generates trajectories over a longer time horizon while preserving uniformity. Next, we present CU-MPPI, which integrates Neural C-Uniform sampling into existing MPPI variants. We analyze the performance of CU-MPPI in simulation and real-world experiments. Our results indicate that in settings where the optimal solution has high curvature, CU-MPPI leads to drastic improvements in performance.

Title: Optimal Output Feedback Learning Control for Discrete-Time Linear Quadratic Regulation
Authors: Kedi Xie, Martin Guay, Shimin Wang, Fang Deng, Maobin Lu
Abstract: This paper studies the linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problem of unknown discrete-time systems via dynamic output feedback learning control. In contrast to the state feedback, the optimality of the dynamic output feedback control for solving the LQR problem requires an implicit condition on the convergence of the state observer. Moreover, due to unknown system matrices and the existence of observer error, it is difficult to analyze the convergence and stability of most existing output feedback learning-based control methods. To tackle these issues, we propose a generalized dynamic output feedback learning control approach with guaranteed convergence, stability, and optimality performance for solving the LQR problem of unknown discrete-time linear systems. In particular, a dynamic output feedback controller is designed to be equivalent to a state feedback controller. This equivalence relationship is an inherent property without requiring convergence of the estimated state by the state observer, which plays a key role in establishing the off-policy learning control approaches. By value iteration and policy iteration schemes, the adaptive dynamic programming based learning control approaches are developed to estimate the optimal feedback control gain. In addition, a model-free stability criterion is provided by finding a nonsingular parameterization matrix, which contributes to establishing a switched iteration scheme. Furthermore, the convergence, stability, and optimality analyses of the proposed output feedback learning control approaches are given. Finally, the theoretical results are validated by two numerical examples.

Title: On discount functions for economic model predictive control without terminal conditions
Authors: Lukas Schwenkel, Daniel Briem, Matthias A. MÃ¼ller, Frank AllgÃ¶wer
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate discounted economic model predictive control (E-MPC) schemes without terminal conditions in scenarios where the optimal operating behavior is a periodic orbit. For such a setting, it is known that a linearly discounted stage cost guarantees asymptotic stability of any arbitrarily small neighborhood of the optimal orbit if the prediction horizon is sufficiently long. However, in some examples very long prediction horizons are needed to achieve the desired performance. In this work, we extend these results by providing the same qualitative stability guarantees for a large class of discount functions. Numerical examples illustrate the influence of the discount function and show that with suitable discounting we can achieve significantly better performance than the linearly discounted E-MPC, even for short prediction horizons.

Title: MERGE -- A Bimodal Dataset for Static Music Emotion Recognition
Authors: Pedro Lima Louro, Hugo Redinho, Ricardo Santos, Ricardo Malheiro, Renato Panda, Rui Pedro Paiva
Abstract: The Music Emotion Recognition (MER) field has seen steady developments in recent years, with contributions from feature engineering, machine learning, and deep learning. The landscape has also shifted from audio-centric systems to bimodal ensembles that combine audio and lyrics. However, a severe lack of public and sizeable bimodal databases has hampered the development and improvement of bimodal audio-lyrics systems. This article proposes three new audio, lyrics, and bimodal MER research datasets, collectively called MERGE, created using a semi-automatic approach. To comprehensively assess the proposed datasets and establish a baseline for benchmarking, we conducted several experiments for each modality, using feature engineering, machine learning, and deep learning methodologies. In addition, we propose and validate fixed train-validate-test splits. The obtained results confirm the viability of the proposed datasets, achieving the best overall result of 79.21% F1-score for bimodal classification using a deep neural network.

Title: Suppressing Beam Squint Effect For Near-Field Wideband Communication Through Movable Antennas
Authors: Yanze Zhu, Qingqing Wu, Yang Liu, Qingjiang Shi, Wen Chen
Abstract: In this correspondence, we study deploying movable antenna (MA) array in a wideband multiple-input-single-output (MISO) communication system, where near-field (NF) channel model is considered. To alleviate beam squint effect, we propose to maximize the minimum analog beamforming gain across the entire wideband spectrum by appropriately adjusting MAs' positions, which is a highly challenging task. By introducing a slack variable and adopting the cutting-the-edge smoothed-gradient-descent-ascent (SGDA) method, we develop algorithms to resolve the aforementioned challenge. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms and demonstrate the benefit of utilizing MA array to mitigate beam squint effect in NF wideband system.

Title: The inverse obstacle problem for nonlinear inclusions
Authors: Vincenzo Mottola, Antonio Corbo Esposito, Luisa Faella, Gianpaolo Piscitelli, Ravi Prakash, Antonello Tamburrino
Abstract: The Monotonocity Principle (MP), stating a monotonic relationship between a material property and a proper corresponding boundary operator, is attracting great interest in the field of inverse problems, because of its fundamental role in developing real time imaging methods. Moreover, under quite general assumptions, a MP for elliptic PDEs with nonlinear coefficients has been established. This MP provided the basis for introducing a new imaging method to deal with the inverse obstacle problem, in the presence of nonlinear anomalies. This constitutes a relevant novelty because there is a general lack of quantitative and physic based imaging method, when nonlinearities are present. The introduction of a MP based imaging method poses a set of fundamental questions regarding the performance of the method in the presence of noise. The main contribution of this work is focused on theoretical aspects and consists in proving that (i) the imaging method is stable and robust with respect to the noise, (ii) the reconstruction approaches monotonically to a well-defined limit, as the noise level approaches to zero, and that (iii) the limit contains the unknown set and is contained in the outer boundary of the unknown set. Results (i) and (ii) come directly from the Monotonicity Principle, while results (iii) requires to prove the so-called Converse of the Monotonicity Principle, a theoretical sults of fundamental relevance to evaluate the ideal (noise-free) performances of the imaging method. The results are provided in a quite general setting for CalderÃ²n problem, and proved for three wide classes where the nonlinearity of the anomaly can be either bounded from infinity and zero, or bounded from zero only, or bounded by infinity only. These classes of constitutive relationships cover the wide majority of cases encountered in applications.

Title: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Categories for Compositional Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Georgios Bakirtzis, Michail Savvas, Ruihan Zhao, Sandeep Chinchali, Ufuk Topcu
Abstract: In reinforcement learning, conducting task composition by forming cohesive, executable sequences from multiple tasks remains challenging. However, the ability to (de)compose tasks is a linchpin in developing robotic systems capable of learning complex behaviors. Yet, compositional reinforcement learning is beset with difficulties, including the high dimensionality of the problem space, scarcity of rewards, and absence of system robustness after task composition. To surmount these challenges, we view task composition through the prism of category theory -- a mathematical discipline exploring structures and their compositional relationships. The categorical properties of Markov decision processes untangle complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks, allowing for strategical reduction of dimensionality, facilitating more tractable reward structures, and bolstering system robustness. Experimental results support the categorical theory of reinforcement learning by enabling skill reduction, reuse, and recycling when learning complex robotic arm tasks.

Title: M2R-Whisper: Multi-stage and Multi-scale Retrieval Augmentation for Enhancing Whisper
Authors: Jiaming Zhou, Shiwan Zhao, Jiabei He, Hui Wang, Wenjia Zeng, Yong Chen, Haoqin Sun, Aobo Kong, Yong Qin
Abstract: State-of-the-art models like OpenAI's Whisper exhibit strong performance in multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR), but they still face challenges in accurately recognizing diverse subdialects. In this paper, we propose M2R-whisper, a novel multi-stage and multi-scale retrieval augmentation approach designed to enhance ASR performance in low-resource settings. Building on the principles of in-context learning (ICL) and retrieval-augmented techniques, our method employs sentence-level ICL in the pre-processing stage to harness contextual information, while integrating token-level k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) retrieval as a post-processing step to further refine the final output distribution. By synergistically combining sentence-level and token-level retrieval strategies, M2R-whisper effectively mitigates various types of recognition errors. Experiments conducted on Mandarin and subdialect datasets, including AISHELL-1 and KeSpeech, demonstrate substantial improvements in ASR accuracy, all achieved without any parameter updates.

Authors: Ahmed Adel Attia, Dorottya Demszky, Tolulope Ogunremi, Jing Liu, Carol Espy-Wilson
Abstract: Creating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems that are robust and resilient to classroom conditions is paramount to the development of AI tools to aid teachers and students. In this work, we study the efficacy of continued pretraining (CPT) in adapting Wav2vec2.0 to the classroom domain. We show that CPT is a powerful tool in that regard and reduces the Word Error Rate (WER) of Wav2vec2.0-based models by upwards of 10%. More specifically, CPT improves the model's robustness to different noises, microphones and classroom conditions.

Title: Coalescing Force of Group Pressure: Consensus in Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics
Authors: Iryna Zabarianska, Anton V. Proskurnikov
Abstract: This work extends the recent opinion dynamics model from Cheng et al., emphasizing the role of group pressure in consensus formation. We generalize the findings to incorporate social influence algorithms with general time-varying, opinion-dependent weights and multidimensional opinions, beyond bounded confidence dynamics. We demonstrate that, with uniformly positive conformity levels, group pressure consistently drives consensus and provide a tighter estimate for the convergence rate. Unlike previous models, the common public opinion in our framework can assume arbitrary forms within the convex hull of current opinions, offering flexibility applicable to real-world scenarios such as opinion polls with random participant selection. This analysis provides deeper insights into how group pressure mechanisms foster consensus under diverse conditions.

Title: Robust and Unbounded Length Generalization in Autoregressive Transformer-Based Text-to-Speech
Authors: Eric Battenberg, RJ Skerry-Ryan, Daisy Stanton, Soroosh Mariooryad, Matt Shannon, Julian Salazar, David Kao
Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) Transformer-based sequence models are known to have difficulty generalizing to sequences longer than those seen during training. When applied to text-to-speech (TTS), these models tend to drop or repeat words or produce erratic output, especially for longer utterances. In this paper, we introduce enhancements aimed at AR Transformer-based encoder-decoder TTS systems that address these robustness and length generalization issues. Our approach uses an alignment mechanism to provide cross-attention operations with relative location information. The associated alignment position is learned as a latent property of the model via backpropagation and requires no external alignment information during training. While the approach is tailored to the monotonic nature of TTS input-output alignment, it is still able to benefit from the flexible modeling power of interleaved multi-head self- and cross-attention operations. A system incorporating these improvements, which we call Very Attentive Tacotron, matches the naturalness and expressiveness of a baseline T5-based TTS system, while eliminating problems with repeated or dropped words and enabling generalization to any practical utterance length.

Title: A Review of Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification in Deep Probabilistic Image Segmentation
Authors: M.M.A. Valiuddin, R.J.G. van Sloun, C.G.A. Viviers, P.H.N. de With, F. van der Sommen
Abstract: Advancements in image segmentation play an integral role within the broad scope of Deep Learning-based Computer Vision. Furthermore, their widespread applicability in critical real-world tasks has resulted in challenges related to the reliability of such algorithms. Hence, uncertainty quantification has been extensively studied within this context, enabling the expression of model ignorance (epistemic uncertainty) or data ambiguity (aleatoric uncertainty) to prevent uninformed decision-making. Due to the rapid adoption of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based segmentation models in high-stake applications, a substantial body of research has been published on this very topic, causing its swift expansion into a distinct field. This work provides a comprehensive overview of probabilistic segmentation, by discussing fundamental concepts of uncertainty quantification, governing advancements in the field as well as the application to various tasks. Moreover, literature on both types of uncertainties trace back to four key applications: (1) to quantify statistical inconsistencies in the annotation process due ambiguous images, (2) correlating prediction error with uncertainty, (3) expanding the model hypothesis space for better generalization, and (4) Active Learning. An extensive discussion follows that includes an overview of utilized datasets for each of the applications and evaluation of the available methods. We also highlight challenges related to architectures, uncertainty quantification methods, standardization and benchmarking, and finally end with recommendations for future work such as methods based on single forward passes and models that appropriately leverage volumetric data.

Title: Predicting Workload in Virtual Flight Simulations using EEG Features (Including Post-hoc Analysis in Appendix)
Authors: Bas Verkennis, Evy van Weelden, Francesca L. Marogna, Maryam Alimardani, Travis J. Wiltshire, Max M. Louwerse
Abstract: Effective cognitive workload management has a major impact on the safety and performance of pilots. Integrating brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) presents an opportunity for real-time workload assessment. Leveraging cognitive workload data from high-fidelity virtual reality (VR) flight simulations allows for dynamic adjustments to training scenarios. While prior studies have predominantly concentrated on EEG spectral power for workload prediction, delving into intra-brain connectivity may yield deeper insights. This study assessed the predictive value of EEG spectral and connectivity features in distinguishing high vs. low workload periods during simulated flight in VR and Desktop conditions. Using an ensemble approach, a stacked classifier was trained to predict workload from the EEG signals of 52 participants. Results showed that the mean accuracy of the model incorporating both spectral and connectivity features improved by 28% compared to the model that solely relied on spectral features. Further research on other connectivity metrics and deep learning models in a large sample of pilots is essential to validate the potential of a real-time workload-prediction BCI. This could contribute to the development of an adaptive training system for safety-critical operational environments.

Title: Data-driven tool wear prediction in milling, based on a process-integrated single-sensor approach
Authors: Eric Hirsch, Christian Friedrich
Abstract: Accurate tool wear prediction is essential for maintaining productivity and minimizing costs in machining. However, the complex nature of the tool wear process poses significant challenges to achieving reliable predictions. This study explores data-driven methods, in particular deep learning, for tool wear prediction. Traditional data-driven approaches often focus on a single process, relying on multi-sensor setups and extensive data generation, which limits generalization to new settings. Moreover, multi-sensor integration is often impractical in industrial environments. To address these limitations, this research investigates the transferability of predictive models using minimal training data, validated across two processes. Furthermore, it uses a simple setup with a single acceleration sensor to establish a low-cost data generation approach that facilitates the generalization of models to other processes via transfer learning. The study evaluates several machine learning models, including transformer-inspired convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory networks (LSTM), support vector machines (SVM), and decision trees, trained on different input formats such as feature vectors and short-time Fourier transform (STFT). The performance of the models is evaluated on two machines and on different amounts of training data, including scenarios with significantly reduced datasets, providing insight into their effectiveness under constrained data conditions. The results demonstrate the potential of specific models and configurations for effective tool wear prediction, contributing to the development of more adaptable and efficient predictive maintenance strategies in machining. Notably, the ConvNeXt model has an exceptional performance, achieving 99.1\% accuracy in identifying tool wear using data from only four milling tools operated until they are worn.

Title: Audio-Visual Deepfake Detection With Local Temporal Inconsistencies
Authors: Marcella Astrid, Enjie Ghorbel, Djamila Aouada
Abstract: This paper proposes an audio-visual deepfake detection approach that aims to capture fine-grained temporal inconsistencies between audio and visual modalities. To achieve this, both architectural and data synthesis strategies are introduced. From an architectural perspective, a temporal distance map, coupled with an attention mechanism, is designed to capture these inconsistencies while minimizing the impact of irrelevant temporal subsequences. Moreover, we explore novel pseudo-fake generation techniques to synthesize local inconsistencies. Our approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art methods using the DFDC and FakeAVCeleb datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting audio-visual deepfakes.

Title: Audio Large Language Models Can Be Descriptive Speech Quality Evaluators
Authors: Chen Chen, Yuchen Hu, Siyin Wang, Helin Wang, Zhehuai Chen, Chao Zhang, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Eng Siong Chng
Abstract: An ideal multimodal agent should be aware of the quality of its input modalities. Recent advances have enabled large language models (LLMs) to incorporate auditory systems for handling various speech-related tasks. However, most audio LLMs remain unaware of the quality of the speech they process. This limitation arises because speech quality evaluation is typically excluded from multi-task training due to the lack of suitable datasets. To address this, we introduce the first natural language-based speech evaluation corpus, generated from authentic human ratings. In addition to the overall Mean Opinion Score (MOS), this corpus offers detailed analysis across multiple dimensions and identifies causes of quality degradation. It also enables descriptive comparisons between two speech samples (A/B tests) with human-like judgment. Leveraging this corpus, we propose an alignment approach with LLM distillation (ALLD) to guide the audio LLM in extracting relevant information from raw speech and generating meaningful responses. Experimental results demonstrate that ALLD outperforms the previous state-of-the-art regression model in MOS prediction, with a mean square error of 0.17 and an A/B test accuracy of 98.6%. Additionally, the generated responses achieve BLEU scores of 25.8 and 30.2 on two tasks, surpassing the capabilities of task-specific models. This work advances the comprehensive perception of speech signals by audio LLMs, contributing to the development of real-world auditory and sensory intelligent agents.

Title: DeepUKF-VIN: Adaptively-tuned Deep Unscented Kalman Filter for 3D Visual-Inertial Navigation based on IMU-Vision-Net
Authors: Khashayar Ghanizadegan, Hashim A. Hashim
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of estimating the orientation, position, and velocity of a vehicle operating in three-dimensional (3D) space with six degrees of freedom (6-DoF). A Deep Learning-based Adaptation Mechanism (DLAM) is proposed to adaptively tune the noise covariance matrices of Kalman-type filters for the Visual-Inertial Navigation (VIN) problem, leveraging IMU-Vision-Net. Subsequently, an adaptively tuned Deep Learning Unscented Kalman Filter for 3D VIN (DeepUKF-VIN) is introduced to utilize the proposed DLAM, thereby robustly estimating key navigation components, including orientation, position, and linear velocity. The proposed DeepUKF-VIN integrates data from onboard sensors, specifically an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and visual feature points extracted from a camera, and is applicable for GPS-denied navigation. Its quaternion-based design effectively captures navigation nonlinearities and avoids the singularities commonly encountered with Euler-angle-based filters. Implemented in discrete space, the DeepUKF-VIN facilitates practical filter deployment. The filter's performance is evaluated using real-world data collected from an IMU and a stereo camera at low sampling rates. The results demonstrate filter stability and rapid attenuation of estimation errors, highlighting its high estimation accuracy. Furthermore, comparative testing against the standard Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) in two scenarios consistently shows superior performance across all navigation components, thereby validating the efficacy and robustness of the proposed DeepUKF-VIN.

Title: CS-Dialogue: A 104-Hour Dataset of Spontaneous Mandarin-English Code-Switching Dialogues for Speech Recognition
Authors: Jiaming Zhou, Yujie Guo, Shiwan Zhao, Haoqin Sun, Hui Wang, Jiabei He, Aobo Kong, Shiyao Wang, Xi Yang, Yequan Wang, Yonghua Lin, Yong Qin
Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a single conversation, presents significant challenges for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Existing Mandarin-English code-switching datasets often suffer from limitations in size, spontaneity, and the lack of full-length dialogue recordings with transcriptions, hindering the development of robust ASR models for real-world conversational scenarios. This paper introduces CS-Dialogue, a novel large-scale Mandarin-English code-switching speech dataset comprising 104 hours of spontaneous conversations from 200 speakers. Unlike previous datasets, CS-Dialogue provides full-length dialogue recordings with complete transcriptions, capturing naturalistic code-switching patterns in continuous speech. We describe the data collection and annotation processes, present detailed statistics of the dataset, and establish benchmark ASR performance using state-of-the-art models. Our experiments, using Transformer, Conformer, and Branchformer, demonstrate the challenges of code-switching ASR, and show that existing pre-trained models such as Whisper still have the space to improve. The CS-Dialogue dataset will be made freely available for all academic purposes.

Title: Integrated Communication and Learned Recognizer with Customized RIS Phases and Sensing Durations
Authors: Yixuan Huang, Jie Yang, Chao-Kai Wen, Shi Jin
Abstract: Future wireless communication networks are expected to be smarter and more aware of their surroundings, enabling a wide range of context-aware applications. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are set to play a critical role in supporting various sensing tasks, such as target recognition. However, current methods typically use RIS configurations optimized once and applied over fixed sensing durations, limiting their ability to adapt to different targets and reducing sensing accuracy. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes an advanced wireless communication system that multiplexes downlink signals for environmental sensing and introduces an intelligent recognizer powered by deep learning techniques. Specifically, we design a novel neural network based on the long short-term memory architecture and the physical channel model. This network iteratively captures and fuses information from previous measurements, adaptively customizing RIS phases to gather the most relevant information for the recognition task at subsequent moments. These configurations are dynamically adjusted according to scene, task, target, and quantization priors. Furthermore, the recognizer includes a decision-making module that dynamically allocates different sensing durations, determining whether to continue or terminate the sensing process based on the collected measurements. This approach maximizes resource utilization efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques while minimizing the impact on communication performance, even when sensing and communication occur simultaneously.

Title: Fair Play in the Fast Lane: Integrating Sportsmanship into Autonomous Racing Systems
Authors: Zhenmin Huang, Ce Hao, Wei Zhan, Jun Ma, Masayoshi Tomizuka
Abstract: Autonomous racing has gained significant attention as a platform for high-speed decision-making and motion control. While existing methods primarily focus on trajectory planning and overtaking strategies, the role of sportsmanship in ensuring fair competition remains largely unexplored. In human racing, rules such as the one-motion rule and the enough-space rule prevent dangerous and unsportsmanlike behavior. However, autonomous racing systems often lack mechanisms to enforce these principles, potentially leading to unsafe maneuvers. This paper introduces a bi-level game-theoretic framework to integrate sportsmanship (SPS) into versus racing. At the high level, we model racing intentions using a Stackelberg game, where Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is employed to derive optimal strategies. At the low level, vehicle interactions are formulated as a Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem (GNEP), ensuring that all agents follow sportsmanship constraints while optimizing their trajectories. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enforcing sportsmanship rules while maintaining competitive performance. We analyze different scenarios where attackers and defenders adhere to or disregard sportsmanship rules and show how knowledge of these constraints influences strategic decision-making. This work highlights the importance of balancing competition and fairness in autonomous racing and provides a foundation for developing ethical and safe AI-driven racing systems.

Title: Hierarchical Neuro-Symbolic Decision Transformer
Authors: Ali Baheri, Cecilia O. Alm
Abstract: We present a hierarchical neuro-symbolic control framework that couples classical symbolic planning with transformer-based policies to address complex, long-horizon decision-making tasks. At the high level, a symbolic planner constructs an interpretable sequence of operators based on logical propositions, ensuring systematic adherence to global constraints and goals. At the low level, each symbolic operator is translated into a sub-goal token that conditions a decision transformer to generate a fine-grained sequence of actions in uncertain, high-dimensional environments. We provide theoretical analysis showing how approximation errors from both the symbolic planner and the neural execution layer accumulate. Empirical evaluations in grid-worlds with multiple keys, locked doors, and item-collection tasks show that our hierarchical approach outperforms purely end-to-end neural approach in success rates and policy efficiency.

Title: Hierarchical Contact-Rich Trajectory Optimization for Multi-Modal Manipulation using Tight Convex Relaxations
Authors: Yuki Shirai, Arvind Raghunathan, Devesh K. Jha
Abstract: Designing trajectories for manipulation through contact is challenging as it requires reasoning of object \& robot trajectories as well as complex contact sequences simultaneously. In this paper, we present a novel framework for simultaneously designing trajectories of robots, objects, and contacts efficiently for contact-rich manipulation. We propose a hierarchical optimization framework where Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) selects optimal contacts between robot \& object using approximate dynamical constraints, and then a NonLinear Program (NLP) optimizes trajectory of the robot(s) and object considering full nonlinear constraints. We present a convex relaxation of bilinear constraints using binary encoding technique such that MILP can provide tighter solutions with better computational complexity. The proposed framework is evaluated on various manipulation tasks where it can reason about complex multi-contact interactions while providing computational advantages. We also demonstrate our framework in hardware experiments using a bimanual robot system. The video summarizing this paper and hardware experiments is found this https URL
