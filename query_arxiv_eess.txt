Title: QSTAformer: A Quantum-Enhanced Transformer for Robust Short-Term Voltage Stability Assessment against Adversarial Attacks
Authors: Yang Li, Chong Ma, Yuanzheng Li, Sen Li, Yanbo Chen, Zhaoyang Dong
Abstract: Short-term voltage stability assessment (STVSA) is critical for secure power system operation. While classical machine learning-based methods have demonstrated strong performance, they still face challenges in robustness under adversarial conditions. This paper proposes QSTAformer-a tailored quantum-enhanced Transformer architecture that embeds parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) into attention mechanisms-for robust and efficient STVSA. A dedicated adversarial training strategy is developed to defend against both white-box and gray-box attacks. Furthermore, diverse PQC architectures are benchmarked to explore trade-offs between expressiveness, convergence, and efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically investigate the adversarial vulnerability of quantum machine learning-based STVSA. Case studies on the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate that QSTAformer achieves competitive accuracy, reduced complexity, and stronger robustness, underscoring its potential for secure and scalable STVSA under adversarial conditions.

Title: Analysis and Compensation of Receiver IQ Imbalance and Residual CFO Error for AFDM
Authors: Nimesha Gunasekara, Ebrahim Bedeer
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is a promising waveform for future wireless communication systems. In this paper, we analyze the impact of receiver in-phase and quadrature (IQ) imbalance and residual carrier frequency offset (CFO) error on AFDM signals. Our analysis shows that the receiver IQ imbalance may not preserve the sparsity of the AFDM effective channel matrix because of the complex-conjugate operator of the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT). Moreover, the residual CFO error causes energy leakage in the effective channel matrix in the affine domain. To mitigate these effects, we extend the linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) detector to handle the improper Gaussian noise arising from the receiver IQ imbalance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LMMSE detector effectively compensates for the receiver hardware impairments.

Title: Cost and Complexity as Barriers to RTLS Adoption in SMEs: A Survey and Analysis
Authors: Peyman Moeini, Mark Coates
Abstract: Real-time location systems (RTLSs) are central to Industry 4.0 and emerging Industry 5.0, providing the spatiotemporal data required for asset tracking, workflow optimization, safety, and integration with WMS, MES, and digital twins. While large enterprises increasingly deploy RTLSs, adoption among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) remains limited. This paper examines whether cost and installation complexity are primary barriers to SME adoption. We position RTLSs within the broader Industry 4.0 and Logistics 4.0 landscape and summarize their operational value. We then synthesize evidence from the literature on technical, financial, and organizational constraints, with emphasis on infrastructure requirements, calibration effort, integration with legacy systems, and human factors. To complement this analysis, we report results from an online survey of sixteen manufacturing and technology professionals in Canada and the United States. Respondents report strong perceived value for real-time tracking but identify upfront cost, installation effort, integration difficulty, and reliance on multiple anchor nodes as dominant obstacles. Most indicate acceptable upfront investments below $10,000 and express a clear preference for low-infrastructure deployments with minimized anchor counts. Building on these findings, we outline design directions for SME-focused RTLSs, including wireless and modular architectures, cloud-managed and self-calibrating systems, standardized integration interfaces, and anchor-minimizing or anchor-free localization methods. Overall, the results show that limited SME adoption stems less from insufficient perceived value than from misalignment between current RTLS deployment models and SME resource constraints.

Title: Explicit Control Barrier Function-based Safety Filters and their Resource-Aware Computation
Authors: Pol Mestres, Shima Sadat Mousavi, Pio Ong, Lizhi Yang, Ersin Das, Joel W. Burdick, Aaron D. Ames
Abstract: This paper studies the efficient implementation of safety filters that are designed using control barrier functions (CBFs), which minimally modify a nominal controller to render it safe with respect to a prescribed set of states. Although CBF-based safety filters are often implemented by solving a quadratic program (QP) in real time, the use of off-the-shelf solvers for such optimization problems poses a challenge in applications where control actions need to be computed efficiently at very high frequencies. In this paper, we introduce a closed-form expression for controllers obtained through CBF-based safety filters. This expression is obtained by partitioning the state-space into different regions, with a different closed-form solution in each region. We leverage this formula to introduce a resource-aware implementation of CBF-based safety filters that detects changes in the partition region and uses the closed-form expression between changes. We showcase the applicability of our approach in examples ranging from aerospace control to safe reinforcement learning.

Title: Topology Identification and Inference over Graphs
Authors: Gonzalo Mateos, Yanning Shen, Georgios B. Giannakis, Ananthram Swami
Abstract: Topology identification and inference of processes evolving over graphs arise in timely applications involving brain, transportation, financial, power, as well as social and information networks. This chapter provides an overview of graph topology identification and statistical inference methods for multidimensional relational data. Approaches for undirected links connecting graph nodes are outlined, going all the way from correlation metrics to covariance selection, and revealing ties with smooth signal priors. To account for directional (possibly causal) relations among nodal variables and address the limitations of linear time-invariant models in handling dynamic as well as nonlinear dependencies, a principled framework is surveyed to capture these complexities through judiciously selected kernels from a prescribed dictionary. Generalizations are also described via structural equations and vector autoregressions that can exploit attributes such as low rank, sparsity, acyclicity, and smoothness to model dynamic processes over possibly time-evolving topologies. It is argued that this approach supports both batch and online learning algorithms with convergence rate guarantees, is amenable to tensor (that is, multi-way array) formulations as well as decompositions that are well-suited for multidimensional network data, and can seamlessly leverage high-order statistical information.

Title: Traffic Equilibrium in Mixed-Autonomy Network with Capped Customer Waiting
Authors: Jiaxin Hou, Kexin Wang, Ruolin Li, Jong-shi Pang
Abstract: This paper develops a unified modeling framework to capture the equilibrium-state interactions among ride-hailing companies, travelers, and traffic of mixed-autonomy transportation networks. Our framework integrates four interrelated sub-modules: (i) the operational behavior of representative ride-hailing Mixed-Fleet Traffic Network Companies (MiFleet TNCs) managing autonomous vehicle (AV) and human-driven vehicle (HV) fleets, (ii) traveler mode-choice decisions taking into account travel costs and waiting time, (iii) capped customer waiting times to reflect the option available to travelers not to wait for TNCs' service beyond his/her patience and to resort to existing travel modes, and (iv) a flow-dependent traffic congestion model for travel times. A key modeling feature distinguishes AVs and HVs across the pickup and service (customer-on-board) stages: AVs follow Wardrop pickup routes but may deviate during service under company coordination, whereas HVs operate in the reverse manner. The overall framework is formulated as a Nonlinear Complementarity Problem (NCP), which is equivalent to a Variational Inequality(VI) formulation based on which the existence of a variational equilibrium solution to the traffic model is established. Numerical experiments examine how AV penetration and Wardrop relaxation factors, which bound route deviation, affect company, traveler, and system performance to various degrees. The results provide actionable insights for policymakers on regulating AV adoption and company vehicle deviation behavior in modern-day traffic systems that are fast changing due to the advances in technology and information accessibility.

Title: Active Optics for Hyperspectral Imaging of Reflective Agricultural Leaf Sensors
Authors: Dexter Burns, Sanjeev Koppal
Abstract: Monitoring plant health increasingly relies on leaf-mounted sensors that provide real-time physiological data, yet efficiently locating and sampling these sensors in complex agricultural environments remains a major challenge. We present an integrated, adaptive, and scalable system that autonomously detects and interrogates plant sensors using a coordinated suite of low-cost optical components including a LiDAR, liquid lens, monochrome camera, filter wheel, and Fast Steering Mirror (FSM). The system first uses LiDAR to identify the distinct reflective signatures of sensors within the field, then dynamically redirects the camera s field of view via the FSM to target each sensor for hyperspectral imaging. The liquid lens continuously adjusts focus to maintain image sharpness across varying depths, enabling precise spectral measurements. We validated the system in controlled indoor experiments, demonstrating accurate detection and tracking of reflective plant sensors and successful acquisition of their spectral data. To our knowledge, no other system currently integrates these sensing and optical modalities for agricultural monitoring. This work establishes a foundation for adaptive, low-cost, and automated plant sensor interrogation, representing a significant step toward scalable, real-time plant health monitoring in precision agriculture.

Title: Permutation-Equivariant Learning for Dynamic Security Assessment of Power System Frequency Response
Authors: Francisco Zelaya-Arrazabal, Sebastian Martinez-Lizana, Hector Pulgar-Painemal, Jin Zhao
Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid model-AI framework for real-time dynamic security assessment of frequency stability in power systems. The proposed method rapidly estimates key frequency parameters under a dynamic set of disturbances, which are continuously updated based on operating conditions and unit commitment. To achieve this, the framework builds on a modal-based formulation of the system frequency response (SFR), which leverages the system's eigenstructure to predict key frequency stability metrics. A Deep Sets-inspired neural network is employed to estimate the complex modal coefficients required by the modal-based SFR approach, formulated as a permutation-equivariant learning problem. This enables fast and accurate prediction of the frequency nadir and its timing across different operating conditions and disturbances. The framework achieves scalability by reusing precomputed modal structures and updating only the disturbance-specific coefficients. It demonstrates strong generalization capabilities without requiring an extensive set of operating scenarios during training or the widespread deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs). The method is validated on the IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus systems, showing superior accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency compared to purely data-driven approaches.

Title: Antenna Coding Design for Multi-User Transmissions Using Pixel Antennas
Authors: Hongyu Li, Shanpu Shen
Abstract: This work investigates exploiting the potential of pixel antennas, which are a reconfigurable antenna technology that can flexibly adjust the antenna characteristics through antenna coding, in multi-user transmissions. To that end, we propose a multi-user multi-input single-output (MISO) pixel antenna system, which deploys the pixel antenna at users, and develop the system model including pixel antenna with antenna coding and multi-user beamspace channels. Aiming at maximizing the sum rate performance, we first propose an algorithm to alternatively design the precoding at the transmitter and the antenna coding at users, which explores the performance boundary for the proposed multi-user MISO pixel antenna system. To reduce the computational complexity, we propose a codebook-based antenna coding design algorithm, where the antenna coder is online optimized from an offline codebook. To further enhance the computation efficiency, we propose a hierarchical codebook-based antenna coding design that uses a multi-layer hierarchical search to achieve a better performance-complexity trade-off. Simulation results show that, adopting the proposed algorithms, the multi-user MISO pixel antenna system can always outperform conventional multi-user MISO systems with fixed antennas. More importantly, results validate that the proposed (hierarchical) codebook-based algorithms can significantly reduce the computational complexity while maintaining a satisfactory sum rate performance.

Title: A Novel Phase-Noise Module for the QUCS Circuit Simulator. Part I : the Periodic Steady-State
Authors: Torsten Djurhuus, Viktor Krozer
Abstract: The paper discusses work done to expand and extend the capabilities of the open-source QUCS circuit simulator through the implementation of a computationally efficient time-domain steady-state analysis module, supporting simulation of autonomous circuits. To our knowledge, this represents the first time such an analysis module has been implemented in the QUCS environment. Hitherto, the only available option was a harmonic-balance module which was strictly limited to non-autonomous (driven) circuits. The research has several important scientific and industrial applications in the area of large-signal steady-state analysis of autonomous circuits e.g. free-running and coupled oscillator circuit networks. The reported results will have great impact w.r.t. analyzing, synthesizing and optimizing oscillatory behavior of various important industrial circuits and systems. The developed tool, furthermore, introduces support for simulating noise performance of circuits operating under large-signal conditions. This paper is the first part of a two-part series documenting the implementation of a novel (coupled)-oscillator phase-noise simulator engine in the QUCS environment. The goal of this undertaking is the advancement of the open-source QUCS project towards becoming a viable competitor to the commercial simulators currently on the market.

Title: Structural Sign Herdability in Temporally Switching Networks with Fixed Topology
Authors: Pradeep M, Twinkle Tripathy
Abstract: This paper investigates structural herdability in a special class of temporally switching networks with fixed topology. We show that when the underlying digraph remains unchanged across all snapshots, the network attains complete SS herdability even in the presence of signed or layer dilations, a condition not applicable to static networks. This reveals a fundamental structural advantage of temporal dynamics and highlights a novel mechanism through which switching can overcome classical obstructions to herdability. To validate these conclusions, we utilize a more relaxed form of sign matching within each snapshot of the temporal network. Furthermore, we show that when all snapshots share the same underlying topology, the temporally switching network achieves $\mathcal{SS}$ herdability within just two snapshots, which is fewer than the number required for structural controllability. Several examples are included to demonstrate these results.

Title: Collision-Aware Density-Driven Control of Multi-Agent Systems via Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Sungjun Seo, Kooktae Lee
Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of safe and efficient area coverage using a multi-agent system operating in environments with obstacles. Applications such as environmental monitoring and search and rescue require robot swarms to cover large domains under resource constraints, making both coverage efficiency and safety essential. To address the efficiency aspect, we adopt the Density-Driven Control (D$^2$C) framework, which uses optimal transport theory to steer agents according to a reference distribution that encodes spatial coverage priorities. To ensure safety, we incorporate Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) into the framework. While CBFs are commonly used for collision avoidance, we extend their applicability by introducing obstacle-specific formulations for both circular and rectangular shapes. In particular, we analytically derive a unit normal vector based on the agent's position relative to the nearest face of a rectangular obstacle, improving safety enforcement in environments with non-smooth boundaries. Additionally, a velocity-dependent term is incorporated into the CBF to enhance collision avoidance. Simulation results validate the proposed method by demonstrating smoother navigation near obstacles and more efficient area coverage than the existing method, while still ensuring collision-free operation.

Title: Outdoor Crowd Flow Estimation Using RSRP from Commercial LTE Base Station: A Field Study
Authors: Kaisei Higeta (Sophia University), Masakatsu Ogawa (Sophia University), Tomoki Murakami (Access Network Service Laboratories, NTT, Inc), Kazuya Ohara (Access Network Service Laboratories, NTT, Inc), Shinya Otsuki (Access Network Service Laboratories, NTT, Inc)
Abstract: With the advent of the 6G era, Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) has attracted increasing attention. One representative of use cases is crowd flow estimation on outdoor streets. However, most existing studies have focused on indoor environments or vehicles, and demonstrations of outdoor crowd flow estimation using commercial LTE base station remain limited. This study addresses this use case and proposes an analysis of a crowd flow estimation method using Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) obtained from a commercial LTE base station. Specifically, pedestrian counts derived from a camera-based object recognition algorithm were associated with the variance of RSRP. The features obtained from the variance were quantitatively evaluated by combining a CatBoost regression model with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. Through this investigation, we clarified that an optimal variance window size for RSRP is 0.1 to 0.2 seconds and that enlarging the counting area increased the features obtained from the variance of RSRP, for machine learning. Consequently, this study is the first to quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of outdoor crowd flow estimation using commercial LTE, while also revealing the characteristic behavior of variance window size and counting area size in feature design.

Title: A Novel Pilot Scheme for Uplink Channel Estimation for Sub-array Structured ELAA in XL-MIMO systems
Authors: Yumeng Zhang, Huayan Guo, Vincent Lau
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel pilot scheme for multi-user uplink channel estimation in extra-large-scale massive MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems with extremely large aperture arrays (ELAA). The large aperture of ELAA introduces spatial non-stationarity, where far-apart users have significantly distinct visibility at the antennas, thereby reducing inter-user interference. This insight motivates our novel pilot scheme to group users with distinct visibility regions to share the same frequency subcarriers for channel estimation, so that more users can be served with reduced pilot overhead. Specifically, the proposed pilot scheme employs frequency-division multiplexing for inter-group channel estimation, while intra-group users -- benefiting from strong spatial orthogonality -- are distinguished by shifted cyclic codes, similar to code-division multiplexing. Additionally, we introduce a sub-array structured ELAA, where each sub-array is a traditional MIMO array and treated as spatial stationary, while the distances between sub-arrays can be significantly larger to achieve an expanded aperture. The channel support for sub-arrays features clustered sparsity in the antenna-delay domain and is modeled by a 2-dimensional (2-D) Markov random field (MRF). Based on this, we propose a low-complexity channel estimation algorithm within a turbo Bayesian inference framework that incorporates the 2-D MRF prior model. Simulations show that the proposed scheme and algorithm allow the XL-MIMO system to support more users, and deliver superior channel estimation performance.

Title: T-ADD: Enhancing DOA Estimation Robustness Against Adversarial Attacks
Authors: Shilian Zheng, Xiaoxiang Wu, Luxin Zhang, Keqiang Yue, Peihan Qi, Zhijin Zhao
Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. However, recent studies have shown that adversarial perturbations can severely compromise the performance of such models. To address this vulnerability, we propose Transformer-based Adversarial Defense for DOA estimation (T-ADD), a transformer-based defense method designed to counter adversarial attacks. To achieve a balance between robustness and estimation accuracy, we formulate the adversarial defense as a joint reconstruction task and introduce a tailored joint loss function. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with three state-of-the-art adversarial defense methods, the proposed T-ADD significantly mitigates the adverse effects of widely used adversarial attacks, leading to notable improvements in the adversarial robustness of the DOA model.

Title: Hyperspectral Image Data Reduction for Endmember Extraction
Authors: Tomohiko Mizutani
Abstract: Endmember extraction from hyperspectral images aims to identify the spectral signatures of materials present in a scene. Recent studies have shown that self-dictionary methods can achieve high extraction accuracy; however, their high computational cost limits their applicability to large-scale hyperspectral images. Although several approaches have been proposed to mitigate this issue, it remains a major challenge. Motivated by this situation, this paper pursues a data reduction approach. Assuming that the hyperspectral image follows the linear mixing model with the pure-pixel assumption, we develop a data reduction technique that removes pixels that do not contain endmembers. We analyze the theoretical properties of this reduction step and show that it preserves pixels that lie close to the endmembers. Building on this result, we propose a data-reduced self-dictionary method that integrates the data reduction with a self-dictionary method based on a linear programming formulation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can substantially reduce the computational time of the original self-dictionary method without sacrificing endmember extraction accuracy.

Title: Structural Methods for handling mode changes in multimode DAE systems
Authors: Albert Benveniste, Benoit Caillaud, Yahao Chen, Khalil Ghorbal, Mathias Malandain
Abstract: Hybrid systems are an important concept in Cyber-Physical Systems modeling, for which multiphysics modeling from first principles and the reuse of models from libraries are key. To achieve this, DAEs must be used to specify the dynamics in each discrete state (or mode in our context). This led to the development of DAE-based equational languages supporting multiple modes, of which Modelica is a popular standard. Mode switching can be time- or state-based. Impulsive behaviors can occur at mode changes. While mode changes are well understood in particular physics (e.g., contact mechanics), this is not the case in physics-agnostic paradigms such as Modelica. This situation causes difficulties for the compilation of programs, often requiring users to manually smooth out mode changes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the hot restart at mode changes in such paradigms. We propose a mathematical meaning for hot restarts (such a mathematical meaning does not exist in general), as well as a combined structural and impulse analysis for mode changes, generating the hot restart even in the presence of impulses. Our algorithm detects at compile time if the mode change is insufficiently specified, in which case it returns diagnostics information to the user.

Title: NWP-based Atmospheric Refractivity Modeling and Fast & Stable Non-uniform Plane Wave Ray-Tracing Simulations for LEO Link Analysis
Authors: Bowoo Jang, Jun Heo, Yong Bae Park, Dong-Yeop Na
Abstract: Existing low-Earth-orbit (LEO) communication link analyses face two main challenges: (1) limited accuracy of 3D atmospheric refractivity reconstructed from sparsely sampled radiosonde data, and (2) numerical instability in previous non-uniform plane-wave ray-tracing algorithms (i.e., underflow under standard double precision), where non-uniform plane waves inevitably arise at complex-valued dielectric interfaces, is caused by extremely small atmospheric loss terms. To address these issues, we reconstruct a high-resolution 3D complex-valued refractivity model using numerical weather prediction data, and develop a fast and numerically stable non-uniform plane-wave ray tracer. The method remains stable in double precision and delivers a 24-fold speedup over high-precision benchmarks. Comparisons show that boresight-error deviations and path-loss differences between the rigorous method and the uniform-plane-wave approximation remain negligible, even under heavy precipitation. Although rays in a lossy atmosphere experience different phase- and attenuation-direction vectors-forming non-uniform plane waves-the resulting effective attenuation along the path is nearly identical to that predicted by the uniform-plane-wave model. These findings justify the continued use of uniform-plane-wave ray tracing in practical LEO link analyses.

Title: Codeshare agreements between airlines: literature review with the aid of artificial intelligence
Authors: Lucas T. B. Mendes, Alessandro V. M. Oliveira
Abstract: Codeshare agreements are contracts that allow two or more airlines to share seats on the same flight. These agreements, which are widespread in commercial aviation as a response to highly competitive environments, have enabled the expansion of airline networks without additional costs or risks for the companies involved. The literature presents ambiguous effects associated with the practice, with evidence of increased supply and reduced prices in situations of route complementarity, while also pointing to anti-competitive impacts in markets where companies act as competitors. A review of scientific production over time, including theoretical contributions and case studies, is essential to understand the evolution of these agreements and their implications, especially in the Brazilian context, marked by its own characteristics and particular regulatory history. Thus, this article reviews the literature on codesharing, with an emphasis on the Brazilian market, and uses the Litmaps computational tool, based on artificial intelligence techniques, to support the contextual analysis of publications through their citation relationships. The ultimate goal is to identify and evaluate the main evidence accumulated over decades on the effects of these agreements in Brazil. The joint analysis of the contributions allows us to outline the current state of knowledge, characterize specificities observed in the Brazilian market, and identify gaps that may guide future studies.

Title: Estimating Hormone Concentrations in the Pituitary-Thyroid Feedback Loop from Irregularly Sampled Measurements
Authors: Seth Siriya, Tobias M. Wolff, Victor G. Lopez, Matthias A. Müller
Abstract: Model-based control techniques have recently been investigated for the recommendation of medication dosages to address thyroid diseases. These techniques often rely on knowledge of internal hormone concentrations that cannot be measured from blood samples. Moreover, the measurable concentrations are typically only obtainable at irregular sampling times. In this work, we empirically verify a notion of sample-based detectability that accounts for irregular sampling of the measurable concentrations on two pituitary-thyroid loop models representing patients with hypo- and hyperthyroidism, respectively, and include the internal concentrations as states. We then implement sample-based moving horizon estimation for the models, and test its performance on virtual patients across a range of sampling schemes. Our study shows robust stability of the estimator across all scenarios, and that more frequent sampling leads to less estimation error in the presence of model uncertainty and misreported dosages.

Title: Active prognosis and diagnosis of modular discrete-event systems
Authors: Shaopeng Hu, Shaowen Miao, Jan Komenda, Zhiwu Li
Abstract: This paper addresses the verification and enforcement of prognosability and diagnosability for discreteevent systems (DESs) modeled by deterministic finite automata. We establish the equivalence between prognosability (respectively, diagnosability) and pre-normality over a subset of the non-faulty language (respectively, a suffix of the faulty language). We then demonstrate the existence of supremal prognosable (respectively, diagnosable) and normal sublanguages. Furthermore, an algorithm is then designed to compute the supremal controllable, normal, and prognosable (respectively, diagnosable) sublanguages. Since DESs are typically composed of multiple components operating in parallel, pure local supervisors are generally insufficient, as prognosability and diagnosability are global properties of a system. Given the limited work on enforcing prognosability or diagnosability in modular DESs, where these properties are enforced through local supervisors, this paper leverages a refined version of pre-normality to compute modular supervisors for local subsystems. The resulting closed-loop system is shown to be globally controllable, normal, and prognosable/ diagnosable. Examples are provided to illustrate the proposed method.

Title: Exploring Perceptual Audio Quality Measurement on Stereo Processing Using the Open Dataset of Audio Quality
Authors: Pablo M. Delgado, Sascha Dick, Christoph Thompson, Chih-Wei Wu, Phillip A. Williams
Abstract: ODAQ (Open Dataset of Audio Quality) provides a comprehensive framework for exploring both monaural and binaural audio quality degradations across a range of distortion classes and signals, accompanied by subjective quality ratings. A recent update of ODAQ, focusing on the impact of stereo processing methods such as Mid/Side (MS) and Left/Right (LR), provides test signals and subjective ratings for the in-depth investigation of state-of-the-art objective audio quality metrics. Our evaluation results suggest that, while timbre-focused metrics often yield robust results under simpler conditions, their prediction performance tends to suffer under the conditions with a more complex presentation context. Our findings underscore the importance of modeling the interplay of bottom-up psychoacoustic processes and top-down contextual factors, guiding future research toward models that more effectively integrate both timbral and spatial dimensions of perceived audio quality.

Title: NN-Based Frequency Domain DPD for OFDM Massive MIMO Transmitters With Multiple States
Authors: Yundi Zhang, Yanshi Sun, Li Chen
Abstract: Frequency domain (FD)-digital predistortion (DPD) is a low-complexity DPD solution for massive multiple-inputmultiple-output (MIMO) transmitters (TXs). In this letter, we extend FD-DPD to scenarios with multiple signal states (e.g., bandwidths and power levels). First, we propose a new neural network (NN)-based FD-DPD model, whose main idea is to use a hypernetwork (HN) to generate parameters for the output layer of the main NN based on the signal states. Then, we introduce how to effectively train the model with the help of time-domain (TD)-DPD. Experimental results show that the proposed model can achieve excellent performance, without requiring additional online training when signal states change.

Title: Distribution-Free Stochastic MPC for Joint-in-Time Chance-Constrained Linear Systems
Authors: Lukas Vogel, Andrea Carron, Eleftherios E. Vlahakis, Dimos V. Dimarogonas
Abstract: This work presents a stochastic model predictive control (MPC) framework for linear systems subject to joint-in-time chance constraints under unknown disturbance distributions. Unlike existing stochastic MPC formulations that rely on parametric or Gaussian assumptions or require expensive offline computations, the proposed method leverages conformal prediction (CP) as a streamlined tool to construct finite-sample confidence regions for the system's stochastic error trajectories with minimal computational effort. These regions enable the relaxation of probabilistic constraints while providing formal guarantees. By employing an indirect feedback mechanism and a probabilistic set-based formulation, we prove recursive feasibility of the relaxed optimization problem and establish chance constraint satisfaction in closed-loop. Furthermore, we extend the approach to the more general output feedback setting with unknown measurement noise distributions. Given available noise samples, we establish satisfaction of the joint chance constraints and recursive feasibility via output measurements alone. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method compared to existing approaches.

Title: Fast and Robust LRSD-based SAR/ISAR Imaging and Decomposition
Authors: Hamid Reza Hashempour, Majid Moradikia, Hamed Bastami, Ahmed Abdelhadi, Mojtaba Soltanalian
Abstract: The earlier works in the context of low-rank-sparse-decomposition (LRSD)-driven stationary synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging have shown significant improvement in the reconstruction-decomposition process. Neither of the proposed frameworks, however, can achieve satisfactory performance when facing a platform residual phase error (PRPE) arising from the instability of airborne platforms. More importantly, in spite of the significance of real-time processing requirements in remote sensing applications, these prior works have only focused on enhancing the quality of the formed image, not reducing the computational burden. To address these two concerns, this article presents a fast and unified joint SAR imaging framework where the dominant sparse objects and low-rank features of the image background are decomposed and enhanced through a robust LRSD. In particular, our unified algorithm circumvents the tedious task of computing the inverse of large matrices for image formation and takes advantage of the recent advances in constrained quadratic programming to handle the unimodular constraint imposed due to the PRPE. Furthermore, we extend our approach to ISAR autofocusing and imaging. Specifically, due to the intrinsic sparsity of ISAR images, the LRSD framework is essentially tasked with the recovery of a sparse image. Several experiments based on synthetic and real data are presented to validate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of imaging quality and computational cost compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Symbol-Level Precoding for Integrated Sensing and Covert Communication
Authors: Yufei Wang, Qiang Li, Hongli Liu, Ying Zhang, Jingran Lin
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems have emerged as a promising solution to improve spectrum efficiency and enable functional convergence. However, ensuring secure information transmission while maintaining high-quality sensing performance remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we investigate an integrated sensing and covert communication (ISCC) system, in which a base station (BS) simultaneously serves multiple downlink users and senses malicious targets that may act as both potential eavesdroppers (Eves) and wardens. We propose a novel symbol-level precoding (SLP)-based waveform design for ISCC that achieves covert communication intrinsically, without requiring additional transmission resources such as artificial noise. The proposed design integrates symbol shaping to enhance reliability for legitimate users and noise shaping to obscure transmission activities from the targets. For imperfect channel state information (CSI), the framework incorporates bounded uncertainty models for user channels and target angles, yielding a more robust design. The resulting ISCC waveform optimization problem is non-convex; to address this, we develop a low-complexity proximal distance algorithm (PDA) with closed-form updates under both PSK and QAM modulations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior covertness and sensing-communication performance with negligible degradation compared to traditional beamforming and conventional SLP approaches without noise-shaping mechanisms.

Title: CSI-Based User Positioning, Channel Charting, and Device Classification with an NVIDIA 5G Testbed
Authors: Reinhard Wiesmayr, Frederik Zumegen, Sueda Taner, Chris Dick, Christoph Studer
Abstract: Channel-state information (CSI)-based sensing will play a key role in future cellular systems. However, no CSI dataset has been published from a real-world 5G NR system that facilitates the development and validation of suitable sensing algorithms. To close this gap, we publish three real-world wideband multi-antenna multi-open RAN radio unit (O-RU) CSI datasets from the 5G NR uplink channel: an indoor lab/office room dataset, an outdoor campus courtyard dataset, and a device classification dataset with six commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) user equipments (UEs). These datasets have been recorded using a software-defined 5G NR testbed based on NVIDIA Aerial RAN CoLab Over-the-Air (ARC-OTA) with COTS hardware, which we have deployed at ETH Zurich. We demonstrate the utility of these datasets for three CSI-based sensing tasks: neural UE positioning, channel charting in real-world coordinates, and closed-set device classification. For all these tasks, our results show high accuracy: neural UE positioning achieves 0.6cm (indoor) and 5.7cm (outdoor) mean absolute error, channel charting in real-world coordinates achieves 73cm mean absolute error (outdoor), and device classification achieves 99% (same day) and 95% (next day) accuracy. The CSI datasets, ground-truth UE position labels, CSI features, and simulation code are publicly available at this https URL

Title: Comparative analysis of WNG-DF compromising beamformers
Authors: Vitor G. P. Curtarelli
Abstract: This work studies beamformers designed to achieve multiple characteristics simultaneously, specifically those compromising white-noise gain and directivity factor. We compare methods explicitly designed for these joint features against those obtained by combining specific single-task beamformers. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the robust superdirective and the tunable beamformers yield the best results among those studied. Notably, these two methods produced nearly identical outputs across all evaluated metrics. These two are also more practical, continuously compromising between the two objectives.

Abstract: Frequency offsets-compensated least mean squares (FO-LMS) algorithm is a generic method for estimating a wireless channel under carrier and sampling frequency offsets when the transmitted signal is beforehand known to the receiver. The algorithm iteratively and explicitly adjusts its estimates of the channel and frequency offsets using stochastic gradient descent-based rules and the step sizes of these rules determine the learning rate and stability of the algorithm. Within the stability conditions, the choice of step sizes reflects a trade-off between the algorithm's ability to react to changes in the channel and the ability to minimize misadjustments caused by noise. This paper provides theoretical expressions to predict and optimize the tracking and misadjusment errors of FO-LMS when estimating channels and frequency offsets with known time-varying characteristics. This work also proposes a method to adjust the FO-LMS's step sizes based on the algorithm's performance when the time-varying characteristics are not known, which is more often the case in practice. Accuracy of the expressions and performance of the proposed variable step sizes algorithm are studied through simulations.

Title: Decision Feedback-Aided Known-Interference Cancellation
Authors: Karel Pärlin, Aaron Byman, Tommi Meriläinen, Taneli Riihonen
Abstract: Known-interference cancellation (KIC) in combination with cooperative jamming can be used to provide covertness and security to wireless communications at the physical layer. However, since the signal of interest (SI) of a wireless communication system acts as estimation noise, i.e., interference, to KIC, the SI limits the extent to which the known interference (KI) can be canceled and that in turn limits the throughput of the wireless communication system that is being hidden or secured. In this letter, we analyze a decision feedback-aided known-interference cancellation (DF-KIC) structure in which both the KI and SI are canceled iteratively and successively. Measurement results demonstrate that introducing decision feedback to KIC improves its KI cancellation capability and hence increases the wireless communication system's useful throughput, albeit at the expense of a higher computational load.

Title: Low-Order $\mathcal{H}_2 / \mathcal{H}_\infty$ Controller Design for Aeroelastic Vibration Suppression
Authors: Mohammad Mirtaba, Juan Augusto Paredes Salazar, Daning Huang, Ankit Goel
Abstract: This paper presents an $\mathcal{H}_2 / \mathcal{H}_\infty$ minimization-based output-feedback controller for active aeroelastic vibration suppression in a cantilevered beam. First, a nonlinear structural model incorporating moderate deflection and aerodynamic loading is derived and discretized using the finite element method (FEM). Then, a low-order linear model is identified from random gaussian input response data from the FEM model to synthesize an output-feedback controller using the $\mathcal{H}_2 / \mathcal{H}_\infty$ framework. A frequency-weighted dynamic filter is introduced to emphasize disturbance frequencies of interest, enabling the controller to target dominant vibration modes. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique for vibration suppression and study its robustness to system parameter variations, including actuator placement.

Title: POLO: Phase-Only Localization in Uplink Distributed MIMO Systems
Authors: Sauradeep Dey, Musa Furkan Keskin, Dario Tagliaferri, Gonzalo Seco-Granados, Mikko Valkama, Henk Wymeersch
Abstract: We propose a low-complexity localization framework for uplink distributed MIMO (D-MIMO) systems, targeting the challenge of minimizing the highly spiky maximum-likelihood (ML) cost function that arises in sparsely deployed phasecoherent access points (APs) with narrowband transmission. In such systems, ML-based localization typically relies on dense grid search, incurring prohibitive computational complexity. To address this, we introduce phase-only localization (POLO), an approach that leverages differential carrier-phase measurements from selected APs to generate a compact set of candidate user positions. The ML cost function is then evaluated only at these candidates, reducing complexity significantly. A key challenge is to devise an AP selection mechanism that reduces the number of candidate points while maintaining reliable coverage. We propose two variants: POLO-I, which selects three APs to provide closed-form candidate positions with low computational cost, and POLO-II, which selects four APs using an alternative strategy that enhances coverage at marginally higher runtime. Comprehensive analytical and simulation results show that POLO achieves a favorable coverage-complexity trade-off, reducing cost by orders of magnitude relative to exhaustive grid search with only marginal loss in coverage. By characterizing this tradeoff under diverse AP configurations, we also provide practical guidelines for selecting between POLO-I and POLO-II depending on latency and coverage requirements.

Title: Echo-CoPilot: A Multi-View, Multi-Task Agent for Echocardiography Interpretation and Reporting
Authors: Moein Heidari, Mohammad Amin Roohi, Armin Khosravi, Ilker Hacihaliloglu
Abstract: Echocardiography is central to contemporary cardiovascular care, but full-study interpretation remains a cognitively demanding, multi-view task that is still performed manually. While recent foundation models for echocardiography can achieve strong performance on individual perceptual subtasks such as view classification, segmentation, or disease prediction, they typically operate in isolation and do not provide a unified, clinically coherent assessment. In this work, we introduce Echo-CoPilot, a multi-view, multi-task agent that uses a large language model to orchestrate a suite of specialized echocardiography tools. Within a ReAct-style loop, the agent decomposes clinician queries, invokes tools for view recognition, cardiac structure segmentation, measurement and disease prediction, and report synthesis, and integrates their outputs into guideline-aware answers and narrative summaries. We evaluate Echo-CoPilot on the public MIMIC-EchoQA benchmark, where it achieves an accuracy of 50.8\%, outperforming both general-purpose and biomedical video vision-language models. Qualitative analyses further show that the agent leverages quantitative measurements and physiologic context to resolve challenging cases near clinical decision thresholds, such as borderline left ventricular hypertrophy or pericardial effusion severity. The code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

Title: DB2-TransF: All You Need Is Learnable Daubechies Wavelets for Time Series Forecasting
Authors: Moulik Gupta, Achyut Mani Tripathi
Abstract: Time series forecasting requires models that can efficiently capture complex temporal dependencies, especially in large-scale and high-dimensional settings. While Transformer-based architectures excel at modeling long-range dependencies, their quadratic computational complexity poses limitations on scalability and adaptability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce DB2-TransF, a novel Transformer-inspired architecture that replaces the self-attention mechanism with a learnable Daubechies wavelet coefficient layer. This wavelet-based module efficiently captures multi-scale local and global patterns and enhances the modeling of correlations across multiple time series for the time series forecasting task. Extensive experiments on 13 standard forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that DB2-TransF achieves comparable or superior predictive accuracy to conventional Transformers, while substantially reducing memory usage for the time series forecasting task. The obtained experimental results position DB2-TransF as a scalable and resource-efficient framework for advanced time series forecasting. Our code is available at this https URL

Title: CHyLL: Learning Continuous Neural Representations of Hybrid Systems
Authors: Sangli Teng, Hang Liu, Jingyu Song, Koushil Sreenath
Abstract: Learning the flows of hybrid systems that have both continuous and discrete time dynamics is challenging. The existing method learns the dynamics in each discrete mode, which suffers from the combination of mode switching and discontinuities in the flows. In this work, we propose CHyLL (Continuous Hybrid System Learning in Latent Space), which learns a continuous neural representation of a hybrid system without trajectory segmentation, event functions, or mode switching. The key insight of CHyLL is that the reset map glues the state space at the guard surface, reformulating the state space as a piecewise smooth quotient manifold where the flow becomes spatially continuous. Building upon these insights and the embedding theorems grounded in differential topology, CHyLL concurrently learns a singularity-free neural embedding in a higher-dimensional space and the continuous flow in it. We showcase that CHyLL can accurately predict the flow of hybrid systems with superior accuracy and identify the topological invariants of the hybrid systems. Finally, we apply CHyLL to the stochastic optimal control problem.

Title: Inertial Magnetic SLAM Systems Using Low-Cost Sensors
Authors: Chuan Huang, Gustaf Hendeby, Isaac Skog
Abstract: Spatially inhomogeneous magnetic fields offer a valuable, non-visual information source for positioning. Among systems leveraging this, magnetic field-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems are particularly attractive because they can provide positioning information and build a magnetic field map on the fly. Moreover, they have bounded error within mapped regions. However, state-of-the-art methods typically require low-drift odometry data provided by visual odometry or a wheel encoder, etc. This is because these systems need to minimize/reduce positioning errors while exploring, which happens when they are in unmapped regions. To address these limitations, this work proposes a loosely coupled and a tightly coupled inertial magnetic SLAM (IM-SLAM) system. The proposed systems use commonly available low-cost sensors: an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a magnetometer array, and a barometer. The use of non-visual data provides a significant advantage over visual-based systems, making it robust to low-visibility conditions. Both systems employ state-space representations, and magnetic field models on different scales. The difference lies in how they use a local and global magnetic field model. The loosely coupled system uses these models separately in two state-space models, while the tightly coupled system integrates them into one state-space model. Experiment results show that the tightly coupled IM-SLAM system achieves lower positioning errors than the loosely coupled system in most scenarios, with typical errors on the order of meters per 100 meters traveled. These results demonstrate the feasiblity of developing a full 3D IM-SLAM systems using low-cost sensors and the potential of applying these systems in emergency response scenarios such as mine/fire rescue.

Title: Simultaneous Classical and Quantum Communications: Recent Progress and Three Challenges
Authors: Phuc V. Trinh, Shinya Sugiura, Carlo Ottaviani, Chao Xu, Lajos Hanzo
Abstract: A critical aspect of next-generation wireless networks is the integration of quantum communications to guard against quantum computing threats to classical networks. Despite successful experimental demonstrations, integrating quantum communications into the classical infrastructure faces substantial challenges, including high costs, compatibility issues, and extra hardware deployment to accommodate both classical and quantum communication equipment. To mitigate these challenges, we explore novel protocols that enable simultaneous classical and quantum communications, relying on a single set of transceivers to jointly modulate and decode classical and quantum information onto the same signal. Additionally, we emphasize extending quantum communication capabilities beyond traditional optical bands into the terahertz, even possibly to millimeter-wave and microwave frequencies, thereby broadening the potential horizon of quantum-secure applications. Finally, we identify open problems that must be addressed to facilitate practical implementation.

Title: Assessing Neuromorphic Computing for Fingertip Force Decoding from Electromyography
Authors: Abolfazl Shahrooei, Luke Arthur, Om Patel, Derek Kamper
Abstract: High-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) provides a noninvasive neural interface for assistive and rehabilitation control, but mapping neural activity to user motor intent remains challenging. We assess a spiking neural network (SNN) as a neuromorphic architecture against a temporal convolutional network (TCN) for decoding fingertip force from motor-unit (MU) firing derived from HD-sEMG. Data were collected from a single participant (10 trials) with two forearm electrode arrays; MU activity was obtained via FastICA-based decomposition, and models were trained on overlapping windows with end-to-end causal convolutions. On held-out trials, the TCN achieved 4.44% MVC RMSE (Pearson r = 0.974) while the SNN achieved 8.25% MVC (r = 0.922). While the TCN was more accurate, we view the SNN as a realistic neuromorphic baseline that could close much of this gap with modest architectural and hyperparameter refinements.

Title: Improving the decoding performance of CA-polar codes
Authors: Jiewei Feng, Peihong Yuan, Ken R. Duffy, Muriel Médard
Abstract: We investigate the use of modern code-agnostic decoders to convert CA-SCL from an incomplete decoder to a complete one. When CA-SCL fails to identify a codeword that passes the CRC check, we apply a code-agnostic decoder that identifies a codeword that satisfies the CRC. We establish that this approach gives gains of up to 0.2 dB in block error rate for CA-Polar codes from the 5G New Radio standard. If, instead, the message had been encoded in a systematic CA-polar code, the gain improves to 0.2 ~ 1dB. Leveraging recent developments in blockwise soft output, we additionally establish that it is possible to control the undetected error rate even when using the CRC for error correction.

Title: Optimality Deviation using the Koopman Operator
Authors: Yicheng Lin, Bingxian Wu, Nan Bai, Yunxiao Ren, Zhisheng Duan
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of approximation error in data-driven optimal control problem of nonlinear systems while using the Koopman operator. While the Koopman operator enables a simplified representation of nonlinear dynamics through a lifted state space, the presence of approximation error inevitably leads to deviations in the computed optimal controller and the resulting value function. We derive explicit upper bounds for these optimality deviations, which characterize the worst-case effect of approximation error. Supported by numerical examples, these theoretical findings provide a quantitative foundation for improving the robustness of data-driven optimal controller design.

Title: Lies We Can Trust: Quantifying Action Uncertainty with Inaccurate Stochastic Dynamics through Conformalized Nonholonomic Lie Groups
Authors: Luís Marques, Maani Ghaffari, Dmitry Berenson
Abstract: We propose Conformal Lie-group Action Prediction Sets (CLAPS), a symmetry-aware conformal prediction-based algorithm that constructs, for a given action, a set guaranteed to contain the resulting system configuration at a user-defined probability. Our assurance holds under both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, non-asymptotically, and does not require strong assumptions about the true system dynamics, the uncertainty sources, or the quality of the approximate dynamics model. Typically, uncertainty quantification is tackled by making strong assumptions about the error distribution or magnitude, or by relying on uncalibrated uncertainty estimates - i.e., with no link to frequentist probabilities - which are insufficient for safe control. Recently, conformal prediction has emerged as a statistical framework capable of providing distribution-free probabilistic guarantees on test-time prediction accuracy. While current conformal methods treat robots as Euclidean points, many systems have non-Euclidean configurations, e.g., some mobile robots have SE(2). In this work, we rigorously analyze configuration errors using Lie groups, extending previous Euclidean Space theoretical guarantees to SE(2). Our experiments on a simulated JetBot, and on a real MBot, suggest that by considering the configuration space's structure, our symmetry-informed nonconformity score leads to more volume-efficient prediction regions which represent the underlying uncertainty better than existing approaches.

Title: L2 Ethernet Switch VLSI Implementation
Authors: Aniruddh Mishra, Benjamin Oommen, Jimmy Liang
Abstract: Ethernet switches are foundational to the global internet infrastructure. These devices route packets of data on a local area network between source addresses to destination media access control addresses. On the L2 layer of the Open Systems Interconnections model, Ethernet switches take in digitized data from a Media Independent Interface and send it to the corresponding output port for the destination address. Switches need to handle parallel input and output streams from each port, prioritizing throughput, efficiency, and packet integrity. Due to the confidential nature of the networking device industry, there do not exist many open source implementations of switching fabrics. We propose an open source design for an L2 Ethernet switch along with the power, performance, and area tradeoffs for architecture decisions.

Title: Design of a six wheel suspension and a three-axis linear actuation mechanism for a laser weeding robot
Authors: Muhammad Usama, Muhammad Ibrahim Khan, Ahmad Hasan, Muhammad Shaaf Nadeem, Khawaja Fahad Iqbal, Jawad Aslam, Mian Ashfaq Ali, Asad Nisar Awan
Abstract: Mobile robots are increasingly utilized in agriculture to automate labor-intensive tasks such as weeding, sowing, harvesting and soil analysis. Recently, agricultural robots have been developed to detect and remove weeds using mechanical tools or precise herbicide sprays. Mechanical weeding is inefficient over large fields, and herbicides harm the soil ecosystem. Laser weeding with mobile robots has emerged as a sustainable alternative in precision farming. In this paper, we present an autonomous weeding robot that uses controlled exposure to a low energy laser beam for weed removal. The proposed robot is six-wheeled with a novel double four-bar suspension for higher stability. The laser is guided towards the detected weeds by a three-dimensional linear actuation mechanism. Field tests have demonstrated the robot's capability to navigate agricultural terrains effectively by overcoming obstacles up to 15 cm in height. At an optimal speed of 42.5 cm/s, the robot achieves a weed detection rate of 86.2\% and operating time of 87 seconds per meter. The laser actuation mechanism maintains a minimal mean positional error of 1.54 mm, combined with a high hit rate of 97\%, ensuring effective and accurate weed removal. This combination of speed, accuracy, and efficiency highlights the robot's potential for significantly enhancing precision farming practices.

Title: Linear Quadratic Regulators: A New Look
Authors: CéEdric Join, Emmanuel Delaveau, Michel Fliess
Abstract: Linear time-invariant control systems can be considered as finitely generated modules over the commutative principal ideal ring $\mathbb{R}[\frac{d}{dt}]$ of linear differential operators with respect to the time derivative. The Kalman controllability in this algebraic language is translated as the freeness of the system module. Linear quadratic regulators rely on quadratic Lagrangians, or cost functions. Any flat output, i.e., any basis of the corresponding free module leads to an open-loop control strategy via an Euler-Lagrange equation, which becomes here a linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. In this approach, the two-point boundary value problem, including the control variables, becomes tractable. It yields notions of optimal time horizon, optimal parameter design and optimal rest-to-rest trajectories. The loop is closed via an intelligent controller derived from model-free control, which is known to exhibit excellent performance concerning model mismatches and disturbances.

Title: Building Audio-Visual Digital Twins with Smartphones
Authors: Zitong Lan, Yiwei Tang, Yuhan Wang, Haowen Lai, Yido Hao, Mingmin Zhao
Abstract: Digital twins today are almost entirely visual, overlooking acoustics-a core component of spatial realism and interaction. We introduce AV-Twin, the first practical system that constructs editable audio-visual digital twins using only commodity smartphones. AV-Twin combines mobile RIR capture and a visual-assisted acoustic field model to efficiently reconstruct room acoustics. It further recovers per-surface material properties through differentiable acoustic rendering, enabling users to modify materials, geometry, and layout while automatically updating both audio and visuals. Together, these capabilities establish a practical path toward fully modifiable audio-visual digital twins for real-world environments.

Title: Data-driven Pressure Recovery in Diffusers
Authors: Juan Augusto Paredes Salazar, Ankit Goel, Rowen Costich, Meliksah Koca, Ozgur Tumuklu, Michael Amitay
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of a data-driven technique based on retrospective cost optimization to optimize the frequency of mass injection into an S-shaped diffuser, with the objective of maximizing the pressure recovery. Experimental data indicated that there is an optimal injection frequency between 100 Hz and 300 Hz with a mass flow rate of 1 percent of the free stream. High-fidelity numerical simulations using compressible unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) are conducted to investigate the mean and temporal features resulting from mass injection into an S-shaped diffuser with differing injection speeds and pulse frequencies. The results are compared with experiments to confirm the accuracy of the numerical solution. Overall, 2-D simulations are relatively in good agreement with the experiment, with 3-D simulations currently under investigation to benchmark the effect of spanwise instabilities. Simulation results with the proposed data-driven technique show improvements upon a baseline case by increasing pressure recovery and reducing the region of flow recirculation within the diffuser.

Title: Spectral Decompositions of Controllability Gramian and Its Inverse based on System Eigenvalues in Companion Form
Authors: Alexey Iskakov, Igor Yadykin
Abstract: Controllability and observability Gramians, along with their inverses, are widely used to solve various problems in control theory. This paper proposes spectral decompositions of the controllability Gramian and its inverse based on system eigenvalues for a continuous LTI dynamical system in the controllability canonical (companion) form. The Gramian and its inverse are represented as sums of Hermitian matrices, each corresponding to individual system eigenvalues or their pairwise combinations. These decompositions are obtained for the solutions of both algebraic and differential Lyapunov and Riccati equations with arbitrary initial conditions, allowing for the estimation of system spectral properties over an arbitrary time interval and their prediction at future moments. The derived decompositions are also generalized to the case of multiple eigenvalues in the dynamics matrix spectrum, enabling a closed-form estimation of the effects of resonant interactions with the system's eigenmodes. The spectral components are interpreted as measurable quantities in the minimum energy control problem. Therefore, they are unambiguously defined and can quantitatively characterize the influence of individual eigenmodes and associated system devices on controllability, observability, and the asymptotic dynamics of perturbation energy. The additional information obtained from these decompositions can improve the accuracy of algorithms in solving various practical problems, such as stability analysis, minimum energy control, structural design, tuning regulators, optimal placement of actuators and sensors, network analysis, and model order reduction.

Title: A Differentiable Digital Twin of Distributed Link Scheduling for Contention-Aware Networking
Authors: Zhongyuan Zhao, Yujun Ming, Kevin Chan, Ananthram Swami, Santiago Segarra
Abstract: Many routing and flow optimization problems in wired networks can be solved efficiently using minimum cost flow formulations. However, this approach does not extend to wireless multi-hop networks, where the assumptions of fixed link capacity and linear cost structure collapse due to contention for shared spectrum resources. The key challenge is that the long-term capacity of a wireless link becomes a non-linear function of its network context, including network topology, link quality, and the traffic assigned to neighboring links. In this work, we pursue a new direction of modeling wireless network under randomized medium access control by developing an analytical network digital twin (NDT) that predicts link duty cycles from network context. We generalize randomized contention as finding a Maximal Independent Set (MIS) on the conflict graph using weighted Luby's algorithm, derive an analytical model of link duty cycles, and introduce an iterative procedure that resolves the circular dependency among duty cycle, link capacity, and contention probability. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed NDT accurately predicts link duty cycles and congestion patterns with up to a 5000x speedup over packet-level simulation, and enables us to optimize link scheduling using gradient descent for reduced congestion and radio footprint.

Title: Distributionally Robust Regret Optimal Control Under Moment-Based Ambiguity Sets
Authors: Feras Al Taha, Eilyan Bitar
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of finite-horizon, linear-quadratic stochastic control problems, where the probability distribution governing the noise process is unknown but assumed to belong to an ambiguity set consisting of all distributions whose mean and covariance lie within norm balls centered at given nominal values. To address the distributional ambiguity, we explore the design of causal affine control policies to minimize the worst-case expected regret over all distributions in the given ambiguity set. The resulting minimax optimal control problem is shown to admit an equivalent reformulation as a tractable convex program that corresponds to a regularized version of the nominal linear-quadratic stochastic control problem. While this convex program can be recast as a semidefinite program, semidefinite programs are typically solved using primal-dual interior point methods that scale poorly with the problem size in practice. To address this limitation, we propose a scalable dual projected subgradient method to compute optimal controllers to an arbitrary accuracy. Numerical experiments are presented to benchmark the proposed method against state-of-the-art data-driven and distributionally robust control design approaches.

Title: Artificial Intelligence in Image-based Cardiovascular Disease Analysis
Authors: Xin Wang, Mingcheng Hu, Connie W. Tsao, Hongtu Zhu
Abstract: Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have significantly influenced the field of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) analysis, particularly in image-based diagnostics. Our paper presents an extensive review of AI applications in image-based CVD analysis, offering insights into its current state and future potential. We systematically categorize the literature based on the primary anatomical structures related to CVD, dividing them into non-vessel structures (such as ventricles and atria) and vessel structures (including the aorta and coronary arteries). This categorization provides a structured approach to explore various imaging modalities like Computed tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which are commonly used in CVD research. Our review encompasses these modalities, giving a broad perspective on the diverse imaging techniques integrated with AI for CVD analysis. We conclude with an examination of the challenges and limitations inherent in current AI-based CVD analysis methods and suggest directions for future research to overcome these hurdles.

Title: Consensus over Clustered Networks Using Intermittent and Asynchronous Output Feedback
Authors: Federico M. Zegers, Sean Phillips
Abstract: Distributed consensus protocols provide a mechanism for spreading information within clustered networks, allowing agents and clusters to make decisions without requiring direct access to the state of the ensemble. In this work, we propose a strategy for achieving system-wide consensus in the states of identical linear time-invariant systems coupled by an undirected graph whose directed sub-graphs are available only at sporadic times. Within this work, the agents of the network are organized into pairwise disjoint clusters, which induce sub-graphs of the undirected parent graph. Some cluster sub-graph pairs are linked by an inter-cluster sub-graph, where the union of all cluster and inter-cluster sub-graphs yields the undirected parent graph. Each agent utilizes a distributed consensus protocol with components that are updated intermittently and asynchronously with respect to other agents and inter-clusters. The closed-loop ensemble dynamics is modeled as a hybrid system, and a Lyapunov-based stability analysis yields sufficient conditions for rendering the agreement subspace (consensus set) globally exponentially stable. Furthermore, an input-to-state stability argument demonstrates the consensus set is robust to a large class of perturbations. A numerical simulation considering both nominal and perturbed scenarios is provided for validation purposes.

Title: Equivariant Test-Time Training with Operator Sketching for Imaging Inverse Problems
Authors: Guixian Xu, Jinglai Li, Junqi Tang
Abstract: Equivariant Imaging (EI) regularization has become the de-facto technique for unsupervised training of deep imaging networks, without any need of ground-truth data. Observing that the EI-based unsupervised training paradigm currently has significant computational redundancy leading to inefficiency in high-dimensional applications, we propose a sketched EI regularization which leverages the randomized sketching techniques for acceleration. We apply our sketched EI regularization to develop an accelerated deep internal learning framework, which can be efficiently applied for test-time network adaptation. Additionally, for network adaptation tasks, we propose a parameter-efficient approach to accelerate both EI and Sketched-EI via optimizing only the normalization layers. Our numerical study on X-ray CT and multicoil magnetic resonance image reconstruction tasks demonstrate that our approach can achieve significant computational acceleration over the standard EI counterpart, especially in test-time training tasks.

Title: Lightweight Model Attribution and Detection of Synthetic Speech via Audio Residual Fingerprints
Authors: Matías Pizarro, Mike Laszkiewicz, Dorothea Kolossa, Asja Fischer
Abstract: As speech generation technologies advance, so do risks of impersonation, misinformation, and spoofing. We present a lightweight, training-free approach for detecting synthetic speech and attributing it to its source model. Our method addresses three tasks: (1) single-model attribution in an open-world setting, (2) multi-model attribution in a closed-world setting, and (3) real vs. synthetic speech classification. The core idea is simple: we compute standardized average residuals--the difference between an audio signal and its filtered version--to extract model-agnostic fingerprints that capture synthesis artifacts. Experiments across multiple synthesis systems and languages show AUROC scores above 99%, with strong reliability even when only a subset of model outputs is available. The method maintains high performance under common audio distortions, including echo and moderate background noise, while data augmentation can improve results in more challenging conditions. In addition, out-of-domain detection is performed using Mahalanobis distances to in-domain residual fingerprints, achieving an F1 score of 0.91 on unseen models, reinforcing the method's efficiency, generalizability, and suitability for digital forensics and security applications.

Title: Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for Integrated Sensing and Communications: A First Experimental Study
Authors: Xinze Lyu, Sundar Aditya, Bruno Clerckx
Abstract: A canonical use case of Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems involves a multi-antenna transmitter communicating with $K$ users and sensing targets in its vicinity. For this setup, precoder and multiple access designs are of utmost importance, as the limited transmit power budget must be efficiently directed towards the desired directions (users and targets) to maximize both communications and sensing performance. This problem has been widely investigated analytically under various design choices, in particular (a) whether or not a dedicated sensing signal is needed, and (b) for different MIMO multiple access techniques, such as Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) and Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA). However, a conclusive answer on which design choice achieves the best ISAC performance, backed by experimental results, remains elusive. We address this vacuum by experimentally evaluating and comparing RSMA and SDMA for communicating with two users $(K = 2)$ and sensing (ranging) one target. Over three scenarios that are representative of \emph{vehicular} ISAC, covering different levels of inter-user interference and separation/integration between sensing and communications, we show that RSMA without a dedicated sensing signal achieves better ISAC performance -- i.e., higher sum throughput (up to $50\%$ peak throughput gain) for similar radar SNR (between $20$ to $24{\rm dB}$) -- than SDMA with a dedicated sensing signal. This first-ever experimental study of RSMA ISAC demonstrates the feasibility and the superiority of RSMA for future multi-functional wireless systems.

Title: Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers for Multi-Target DOA Estimation
Authors: Tierui Gong, Chau Yuen, Chong Meng Samson See, Mérouane Debbah, Lajos Hanzo
Abstract: Quantum sensing technologies have experienced rapid progresses since entering the `second quantum revolution'. Among various candidates, schemes relying on Rydberg atoms exhibit compelling advantages for detecting radio frequency signals. Based on this, Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) have emerged as a promising solution to classical wireless communication and sensing. To harness the advantages and exploit the potential of RAQRs in wireless sensing, we investigate the realization of the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation by RAQRs. Specifically, we first conceive a Rydberg atomic quantum uniform linear array (RAQ-ULA) aided wireless receiver for multi-target DOA detection and propose the corresponding signal model of this sensing system. Our model reveals that the presence of the radio-frequency local oscillator in the RAQ-ULA creates sensor gain mismatches, which degrade the DOA estimation significantly by employing the classical Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariant Techniques (ESPRIT). To solve this sensor gain mismatch problem, we propose the Rydberg atomic quantum ESPRIT (RAQ-ESPRIT) relying on our model. Lastly, we characterize our scheme through numerical simulations, where the results exhibit that it is capable of reducing the estimation error of its classical counterpart on the order of $> 400$-fold and $> 9000$-fold in the PSL and SQL, respectively.

Title: Impact and Mitigation of Current Saturation Algorithms in Grid-Forming Inverters on Power Swing Detection
Authors: Yanshu Niu, Zhe Yang, Bikash C. Pal
Abstract: Grid-forming (GFM) inverter-based resources (IBRs) are capable of emulating the external characteristics of synchronous generators (SGs) through the careful design of the control loops. However, the current limiter in the control loops of the GFM IBR poses challenges to the effectiveness of power swing detection functions designed for SG-based systems. Among various current limiting strategies, current saturation algorithms (CSAs) are widely employed for their strict current limiting capability, and are the focus of this paper. The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the conditions for entering and exiting the current saturation mode of the GFM IBR under three CSAs. The corresponding impedance trajectories observed by the relay on the GFM IBR side are investigated. The analysis results reveal that the unique impedance trajectories under these CSAs markedly differ from those associated with SGs. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the conventional power swing detection scheme may lose functionality due to the rapid movement of the trajectory. To mitigate this issue, an optimal current saturation strategy is proposed. Conclusions are validated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink.

Abstract: Many fault diagnosis methods of rotating machines are based on discriminative features extracted from signals collected from the key components such as bearings. However, under complex operating conditions, periodic impulsive characteristics in the signal related to weak fault information are often obscured by noise interference. Consequently, existing approaches struggle to learn interpretable fault-related features in such scenarios. This paper proposes a novel transformer framework (FE-MCFormer) to extract interpretable time-frequency features, with the aim of improving the fault detection accuracy and intrepretability of rotating machines under strong noise. First, a Fourier adaptive reconstruction embedding layer is introduced as a global information encoder in the model. Subsequently, a time-frequency fusion module is designed, further improve the model robustness and interpretability. The effectiveness of FE-MCFormer in machine fault diagnosis is validated through three case studies.

Title: Adapting to Change: A Comparison of Continual and Transfer Learning for Modeling Building Thermal Dynamics under Concept Drifts
Authors: Fabian Raisch, Max Langtry, Felix Koch, Ruchi Choudhary, Christoph Goebel, Benjamin Tischler
Abstract: Transfer Learning (TL) is currently the most effective approach for modeling building thermal dynamics when only limited data are available. TL uses a pretrained model that is fine-tuned to a specific target building. However, it remains unclear how to proceed after initial fine-tuning, as more operational measurement data are collected over time. This challenge becomes even more complex when the dynamics of the building change, for example, after a retrofit or a change in occupancy. In Machine Learning literature, Continual Learning (CL) methods are used to update models of changing systems. TL approaches can also address this challenge by reusing the pretrained model at each update step and fine-tuning it with new measurement data. A comprehensive study on how to incorporate new measurement data over time to improve prediction accuracy and address the challenges of concept drifts (changes in dynamics) for building thermal dynamics is still missing. Therefore, this study compares several CL and TL strategies, as well as a model trained from scratch, for thermal dynamics modeling during building operation. The methods are evaluated using 5--7 years of simulated data representative of single-family houses in Central Europe, including scenarios with concept drifts from retrofits and changes in occupancy. We propose a CL strategy (Seasonal Memory Learning) that provides greater accuracy improvements than existing CL and TL methods, while maintaining low computational effort. SML outperformed the benchmark of initial fine-tuning by 28.1\% without concept drifts and 34.9\% with concept drifts.

Title: TranSimHub:A Unified Air-Ground Simulation Platform for Multi-Modal Perception and Decision-Making
Authors: Maonan Wang, Yirong Chen, Yuxin Cai, Aoyu Pang, Yuejiao Xie, Zian Ma, Chengcheng Xu, Kemou Jiang, Ding Wang, Laurent Roullet, Chung Shue Chen, Zhiyong Cui, Yuheng Kan, Michael Lepech, Man-On Pun
Abstract: Air-ground collaborative intelligence is becoming a key approach for next-generation urban intelligent transportation management, where aerial and ground systems work together on perception, communication, and decision-making. However, the lack of a unified multi-modal simulation environment has limited progress in studying cross-domain perception, coordination under communication constraints, and joint decision optimization. To address this gap, we present TranSimHub, a unified simulation platform for air-ground collaborative intelligence. TranSimHub offers synchronized multi-view rendering across RGB, depth, and semantic segmentation modalities, ensuring consistent perception between aerial and ground viewpoints. It also supports information exchange between the two domains and includes a causal scene editor that enables controllable scenario creation and counterfactual analysis under diverse conditions such as different weather, emergency events, and dynamic obstacles. We release TranSimHub as an open-source platform that supports end-to-end research on perception, fusion, and control across realistic air and ground traffic scenes.

Title: A Low-Complexity Speech Codec Using Parametric Dithering for ASR
Authors: Ellison Murray, Morriel Kasher, Predrag Spasojevic
Abstract: Dithering is a technique commonly used to improve the perceptual quality of lossy data compression. In this work, we analytically and experimentally justify the use of dithering for ASR input compression. We formalize an understanding of optimal ASR performance under lossy input compression and leverage this to propose a parametric dithering technique for a low-complexity speech compression pipeline. The method performs well at 1-bit resolution, showing a 25\% relative CER improvement, while also demonstrating improvements of 32.4\% and 33.5\% at 2- and 3-bit resolution, respectively, with our second dither choice yielding a reduced data rate. The proposed codec is adaptable to meet performance targets or stay within entropy constraints.

Title: Effective Online Exam Proctoring by Combining Lightweight Face Detection and Deep Recognition
Authors: Xu Yang, Juantao Zhong, Daoyuan Wu, Xiao Yi, Jimmy H. M. Lee, Tan Lee, Peng Han
Abstract: Online exams, conducted via video conferencing platforms such as Zoom, have become popular in educational institutions since COVID-19. While convenient, ensuring the integrity and security of online exams remains challenging, as traditional invigilation struggles to effectively monitor multiple student video feeds in real time. In this paper, we present iExam, an effective online exam proctoring and analysis system that combines lightweight face detection and deep recognition. iExam employs real-time face detection to assist invigilators in continuously monitoring student presence, and leverages deep face recognition for post-exam video analysis to identify abnormal behaviors--including face disappearance, face rotation, and identity substitution. To realize this system, we address three core challenges: (i) designing a lightweight approach to efficiently capture and analyze exam video streams in real time; (ii) developing an enhanced OCR method to automatically extract student identities from dynamically positioned Zoom name tags, enabling reliable ground truth labeling without manual intervention; and (iii) optimizing the training and inference pipeline to significantlyreduce resource and time requirements on ordinary teacher devices. Extensive experiments demonstrate that iExam achieves 90.4% accuracy for real-time face detection and 98.4% accuracy for post-exam face recognition, while maintaining low overhead. These results show that iExam can substantially enhance the automation and reliability of online exam proctoring in practice.

Title: JITServe: SLO-aware LLM Serving with Imprecise Request Information
Authors: Wei Zhang, Zhiyu Wu, Yi Mu, Ning Rui, Banruo Liu, Nikhil Sarda, Myungjin Lee, Fan Lai
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into applications ranging from interactive chatbots to multi-agent systems has introduced a wide spectrum of service-level objectives (SLOs) for responsiveness. These include latency-sensitive requests emphasizing per-token latency in streaming chat, deadline-sensitive requests requiring rapid full responses to trigger external tools, and compound requests with evolving dependencies across multiple LLM calls. Despite-or perhaps, because of-this workload diversity and unpredictable request information (e.g., response lengths and dependencies), existing request schedulers have focused on aggregate performance, unable to ensure application-level SLO needs. This paper presents JITServe, the first SLO-aware LLM serving system designed to maximize service goodput (e.g., the number of tokens meeting request SLOs) across diverse workloads. JITServe novelly schedules requests using imprecise request information and gradually relaxes this conservatism by refining request information estimates as generation progresses. It applies a grouped margin goodput maximization algorithm to allocate just enough serving bandwidth to satisfy each request's SLO just-in-time (JIT), maximizing residual capacity for others, while deciding the composition of requests in a batch to maximize efficiency and goodput with provable guarantees. Our evaluation across diverse realistic workloads, including chat, deep research, and agentic pipelines, shows that JITServe improves service goodput by 1.4x-6.3x, alternatively achieving 28.5%-83.2% resource savings, compared to state-of-the-art designs.

Title: Panoramic Out-of-Distribution Segmentation
Authors: Mengfei Duan, Yuheng Zhang, Yihong Cao, Fei Teng, Kai Luo, Jiaming Zhang, Kailun Yang, Zhiyong Li
Abstract: Panoramic imaging enables capturing 360° images with an ultra-wide Field-of-View (FoV) for dense omnidirectional perception, which is critical to applications, such as autonomous driving and augmented reality, etc. However, current panoramic semantic segmentation methods fail to identify outliers, and pinhole Out-of-distribution Segmentation (OoS) models perform unsatisfactorily in the panoramic domain due to pixel distortions and background clutter. To address these issues, we introduce a new task, Panoramic Out-of-distribution Segmentation (PanOoS), with the aim of achieving comprehensive and safe scene understanding. Furthermore, we propose the first solution, POS, which adapts to the characteristics of panoramic images through text-guided prompt distribution learning. Specifically, POS integrates a disentanglement strategy designed to materialize the cross-domain generalization capability of CLIP. The proposed Prompt-based Restoration Attention (PRA) optimizes semantic decoding by prompt guidance and self-adaptive correction, while Bilevel Prompt Distribution Learning (BPDL) refines the manifold of per-pixel mask embeddings via semantic prototype supervision. Besides, to compensate for the scarcity of PanOoS datasets, we establish two benchmarks: DenseOoS, which features diverse outliers in complex environments, and QuadOoS, captured by a quadruped robot with a panoramic annular lens system. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance of POS, with AuPRC improving by 34.25% and FPR95 decreasing by 21.42% on DenseOoS, outperforming state-of-the-art pinhole-OoS methods. Moreover, POS achieves leading closed-set segmentation capabilities and advances the development of panoramic understanding. Code and datasets will be available at this https URL.

Title: Forensic deepfake audio detection using segmental speech features
Authors: Tianle Yang, Chengzhe Sun, Siwei Lyu, Phil Rose
Abstract: This study explores the potential of using acoustic features of segmental speech sounds to detect deepfake audio. These features are highly interpretable because of their close relationship with human articulatory processes and are expected to be more difficult for deepfake models to replicate. The results demonstrate that certain segmental features commonly used in forensic voice comparison (FVC) are effective in identifying deep-fakes, whereas some global features provide little value. These findings underscore the need to approach audio deepfake detection using methods that are distinct from those employed in traditional FVC, and offer a new perspective on leveraging segmental features for this purpose. In addition, the present study proposes a speaker-specific framework for deepfake detection, which differs fundamentally from the speaker-independent systems that dominate current benchmarks. While speaker-independent frameworks aim at broad generalization, the speaker-specific approach offers advantages in forensic contexts where case-by-case interpretability and sensitivity to individual phonetic realization are essential.

Title: Towards Robust Assessment of Pathological Voices via Combined Low-Level Descriptors and Foundation Model Representations
Authors: Whenty Ariyanti, Kuan-Yu Chen, Sabato Marco Siniscalchi, Hsin-Min Wang, Yu Tsao
Abstract: Perceptual voice quality assessment plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring voice disorders. Traditional methods, such as the Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice (CAPE-V) and the Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, and Strain (GRBAS) scales, rely on expert raters and are prone to inter-rater variability, emphasizing the need for objective solutions. This study introduces the Voice Quality Assessment Network (VOQANet), a deep learning framework that employs an attention mechanism and Speech Foundation Model (SFM) embeddings to extract high-level features. To further enhance performance, we propose VOQANet+, which integrates self-supervised SFM embeddings with low-level acoustic descriptors-namely jitter, shimmer, and harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR). Unlike previous approaches that focus solely on vowel-based phonation (PVQD-A), our models are evaluated on both vowel-level and sentence-level speech (PVQD-S) to assess generalizability. Experimental results demonstrate that sentence-based inputs yield higher accuracy, particularly at the patient level. Overall, VOQANet consistently outperforms baseline models in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient across CAPE-V and GRBAS dimensions, with VOQANet+ achieving even greater performance gains. Additionally, VOQANet+ maintains consistent performance under noisy conditions, suggesting enhanced robustness for real-world and telehealth applications. This work highlights the value of combining SFM embeddings with low-level features for accurate and robust pathological voice assessment.

Title: Long-Duration Station-Keeping Strategy for Cislunar Spacecraft Formations
Authors: Ethan Foss, Yuji Takubo, Simone D'Amico
Abstract: This paper demonstrates a novel guidance and control strategy for cislunar near-rectilinear halo orbit formation-keeping applied to high-fidelity dynamics. Bounded relative motion is constructed about long-duration ephemeris trajectories with osculating invariant circles to form quasi-periodic relative orbits. State-of-the-art absolute control strategies are paired with a simple and effective relative control feedback law. Finally, a control barrier function is implemented to ensure recursively passively-safe bounded relative motion under feedback in the presence of possible missed maneuver events for the duration of the formation flight. The strategy is verified in high-fidelity simulation environments through Monte Carlo trials.

Title: It Hears, It Sees too: Multi-Modal LLM for Depression Detection By Integrating Visual Understanding into Audio Language Models
Authors: Xiangyu Zhao, Yaling Shen, Yiwen Jiang, Zimu Wang, Jiahe Liu, Maxmartwell H Cheng, Guilherme C Oliveira, Robert Desimone, Dominic Dwyer, Zongyuan Ge
Abstract: Depression is one of the most prevalent mental health disorders globally. In recent years, multi-modal data, such as speech, video, and transcripts, has been increasingly used to develop AI-assisted depression assessment systems. Large language models have further advanced this field due to their strong language understanding and generalization capabilities. However, conventional LLMs remain text-centric and cannot process the rich non-verbal cues found in audio and visual modalities, which are critical components in mental health evaluation. While multi-modal LLMs offer a promising direction, few are tailored for psychological applications. In this study, we propose a novel multi-modal LLM framework for depression detection. Our approach augments an audio language model with visual understanding and aligns audio-visual features at the timestamp level. This fine-grained alignment improves modeling of temporal dynamics across modalities while reducing the need for extensive training data and computational resources. Experiments on the DAIC-WoZ dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms both single-modality approaches and previous multi-modal methods. Moreover, the proposed framework can be extended to incorporate additional physiological signals, paving the way for broader clinical applications beyond mental health.

Title: Quantum Encrypted Control of Networked Systems
Authors: Zihao Ren, Daniel Quevedo, Salah Sukkarieh, Guodong Shi
Abstract: Encrypted control has been extensively studied to ensure the confidentiality of system states and control inputs for networked control systems. This paper presents a computationally efficient encrypted control framework for networked systems enabled by quantum communication. A quantum channel between sensors and actuators is used to generate identical secret keys, whose security is further enhanced through quantum key distribution. These keys enable lightweight encryption and decryption while preserving confidentiality and control accuracy. We develop a novel encryption-decryption architecture for state-feedback control of linear systems based on quantum keys, and characterize the impact of quantum state errors on closed-loop stability. In particular, we establish the existence of a critical threshold on intrinsic quantum noise below which stability is guaranteed. In contrast to classical encrypted control schemes, which may collapse under a single key-bit error, the proposed quantum encrypted control exhibits strong robustness to key imperfections. We further adopt quantization techniques to address the scenarios with limited communication bits in practical situations, and implement privacy protection for quantum keys based on a stochastic quantizer. These results demonstrate that integrating quantum technologies into control systems in a nontrivial and principled manner, even at their current level of maturity, can yield substantial performance gains in reducing computational complexity and improving resilience to key errors while ensuring security against multiple eavesdropping sources.

Title: LLM-Driven Composite Neural Architecture Search for Multi-Source RL State Encoding
Authors: Yu Yu, Qian Xie, Nairen Cao, Li Jin
Abstract: Designing state encoders for reinforcement learning (RL) with multiple information sources -- such as sensor measurements, time-series signals, image observations, and textual instructions -- remains underexplored and often requires manual design. We formalize this challenge as a problem of composite neural architecture search (NAS), where multiple source-specific modules and a fusion module are jointly optimized. Existing NAS methods overlook useful side information from the intermediate outputs of these modules -- such as their representation quality -- limiting sample efficiency in multi-source RL settings. To address this, we propose an LLM-driven NAS pipeline in which the LLM serves as a neural architecture design agent, leveraging language-model priors and intermediate-output signals to guide sample-efficient search for high-performing composite state encoders. On a mixed-autonomy traffic control task, our approach discovers higher-performing architectures with fewer candidate evaluations than traditional NAS baselines and the LLM-based GENIUS framework.
