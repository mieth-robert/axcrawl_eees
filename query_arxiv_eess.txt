Title: Evaluating the Influence of Satellite Systems on Terrestrial Networks: Analyzing S-Band Interference
Authors: Lingrui Zhang, Zheng Li, Sheng Yang
Abstract: The co-existence of terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) is essential for achieving comprehensive global coverage in sixth-generation cellular networks. Given the escalating demand for spectrum, there is an ongoing global discourse on the feasibility of sharing certain frequencies currently utilized by terrestrial networks (TNs) with NTNs. However, this sharing leads to co-channel interference and subsequent performance degradation. This paper specifically investigates the interference caused by NTNs on TNs in the S-band and its relationship with the relative position between satellite and TN user equipment. We analyzed the transmission mechanisms of satellite signals and employed the ITU two-state model for our interference analysis. Through simulations, we evaluated the interference intensity at different separation distances and slant ranges. Our findings reveal that the angle between the user equipment direction and the sub-satellite point direction from the beam center significantly influences the interference level. Furthermore, we determine the minimum separation distance needed to keep the interference-to-noise ratio of NTN interference below 0 dB.

Title: EndoDINO: A Foundation Model for GI Endoscopy
Authors: Patrick Dermyer, Angad Kalra, Matt Schwartz
Abstract: In this work, we present EndoDINO, a foundation model for GI endoscopy tasks that achieves strong generalizability by pre-training on a well-curated image dataset sampled from the largest known GI endoscopy video dataset in the literature. Specifically, we pre-trained ViT models with 1B, 307M, and 86M parameters using datasets ranging from 100K to 10M curated images. Using EndoDINO as a frozen feature encoder, we achieved state-of-the-art performance in anatomical landmark classification, polyp segmentation, and Mayo endoscopic scoring (MES) for ulcerative colitis with only simple decoder heads.

Title: Mel-Spectrogram Inversion via Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
Authors: Yoshiki Masuyama, Natsuki Ueno, Nobutaka Ono
Abstract: Signal reconstruction from its mel-spectrogram is known as mel-spectrogram inversion and has many applications, including speech and foley sound synthesis. In this paper, we propose a mel-spectrogram inversion method based on a rigorous optimization algorithm. To reconstruct a time-domain signal with inverse short-time Fourier transform (STFT), both full-band STFT magnitude and phase should be predicted from a given mel-spectrogram. Their joint estimation has outperformed the cascaded full-band magnitude prediction and phase reconstruction by preventing error accumulation. However, the existing joint estimation method requires many iterations, and there remains room for performance improvement. We present an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based joint estimation method motivated by its success in various nonconvex optimization problems including phase reconstruction. An efficient update of each variable is derived by exploiting the conditional independence among the variables. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on speech and foley sounds.

Title: Bit-depth color recovery via off-the-shelf super-resolution models
Authors: Xuanshuo Fu, Danna Xue, Javier Vazquez-Corral
Abstract: Advancements in imaging technology have enabled hardware to support 10 to 16 bits per channel, facilitating precise manipulation in applications like image editing and video processing. While deep neural networks promise to recover high bit-depth representations, existing methods often rely on scale-invariant image information, limiting performance in certain scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that integrates a super-resolution architecture to extract detailed a priori information from images. By leveraging interpolated data generated during the super-resolution process, our method achieves pixel-level recovery of fine-grained color details. Additionally, we demonstrate that spatial features learned through the super-resolution process significantly contribute to the recovery of detailed color depth information. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the potential of super-resolution for high-fidelity color restoration.

Title: Sub-band Domain Multi-Hypothesis Acoustic Echo Canceler Based Acoustic Scene Analysis
Authors: Benjamin J Southwell, Yin-Lee Ho, David Gunawan
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for acoustic scene analysis by exploiting an ensemble of statistics extracted from a sub-band domain multi-hypothesis acoustic echo canceler (SDMH-AEC). A well-designed SDMH-AEC employs multiple adaptive filtering strategies with potentially complementary behaviours during convergence, perturbations, and steady-state conditions. By aggregating statistics across the sub-bands, we derive a feature vector that exhibits strong discriminative power for distinguishing different acoustic events and estimating acoustic parameters. The complementary nature of the SDMH-AEC filters provides a rich source of information that can be extracted at insignificant cost for acoustic scene analysis tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach experimentally with real data containing double-talk, echo path change and events where the full-duplex device is physically moved. The extracted features enable acoustic scene analysis using existing echo cancellation algorithms and techniques.

Title: Downlink Performance of Cell-Free Massive MIMO for LEO Satellite Mega-Constellation
Authors: Xiangyu Li, Bodong Shang
Abstract: Low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication (SatCom) has emerged as a promising technology for improving wireless connectivity in global areas. Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO), an architecture recently proposed for next-generation networks, has yet to be fully explored for LEO satellites. In this paper, we investigate the downlink performance of a CF-mMIMO LEO SatCom network, where many satellite access points (SAPs) simultaneously serve the corresponding ground user terminals (UTs). Using tools from stochastic geometry, we model the locations of SAPs and UTs on surfaces of concentric spheres using Poisson point processes (PPPs) and present expressions based on linear minimum-mean-square-error (LMMSE) channel estimation and conjugate beamforming. Then, we derive the coverage probabilities in both fading and non-fading scenarios, with significant system parameters such as the Nakagami fading parameter, number of UTs, number of SAPs, orbital altitude, and service range brought by the dome angle. Finally, the analytical model is verified by extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Simulation results show that stronger line-of-sight (LoS) effects and a more comprehensive service range of the UT bring higher coverage probability despite existing multi-user interference. Moreover, we found that there exist optimal numbers of UTs for different orbital altitudes and dome angles, which provides valuable system design insights.

Title: Array Gain for Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)
Authors: Chongjun Ouyang, Zhaolin Wang, Yuanwei Liu, Zhiguo Ding
Abstract: Pinching antennas is a novel flexible-antenna technology, which can be realized by employing small dielectric particles on a waveguide. The aim of this letter is to characterize the array gain achieved by pinching-antenna systems (PASS). A closed-form upper bound on the array gain is derived by fixing the inter-antenna spacing. Asymptotic analyses of this bound are conducted by considering an infinitely large number of antennas, demonstrating the existence of an optimal number of antennas that maximizes the array gain. The relationship between the array gain and inter-antenna spacing is further explored by incorporating the effect of mutual coupling. It is proven that there also exists an optimal inter-antenna spacing that maximizes the array gain. Numerical results demonstrate that by optimizing the number of antennas and inter-antenna spacing, PASS can achieve a significantly larger array gain than conventional fixed-location antenna systems.

Title: Non-intrusive Data-driven ADI-based Low-rank Balanced Truncation
Authors: Umair Zulfiqar
Abstract: In this short note, a non-intrusive data-driven formulation of ADI-based low-rank balanced truncation is provided. The proposed algorithm only requires transfer function samples at the mirror images of ADI shifts. If some shifts are used in both approximating the controllability Gramian and the observability Gramian, then samples of the transfer function's derivative at these shifts are also needed to enforce Hermite interpolation in the Loewner framework. It is noted that ADI-based low-rank balanced truncation can be viewed as a two-step process. The first step involves constructing an interpolant of the original model at the mirror images of the ADI shifts, which can be done non-intrusively within the Loewner framework. The second step involves reducing this interpolant using low-rank factors of Gramians associated with the interpolation data through the balanced square-root algorithm. This second step does not require any system information, making the overall process non-intrusive with the only required information being samples of the transfer function and/or its derivative at the mirror images of ADI shifts. Furthermore, it is shown that when the order of the reduced model in ADI-based low-rank balanced truncation is selected to match the numerical rank of the low-rank factors of the Gramians, it effectively reduces to standard interpolation at the mirror images of the ADI shift. An illustrative example is provided to explain the proposed approach.

Title: Formally Verified Neural Lyapunov Function for Incremental Input-to-State Stability of Unknown Systems
Authors: Ahan Basu, Bhabani Shankar Dey, Pushpak Jagtap
Abstract: This work presents an approach to synthesize a Lyapunov-like function to ensure incrementally input-to-state stability ($\delta$-ISS) property for an unknown discrete-time system. To deal with challenges posed by unknown system dynamics, we parameterize the Lyapunov-like function as a neural network, which we train using the data samples collected from the unknown system along with appropriately designed loss functions. We propose a validity condition to test the obtained function and incorporate it into the training framework to ensure provable correctness at the end of the training. Finally, the usefulness of the proposed technique is proved using two case studies: a scalar non-linear dynamical system and a permanent magnet DC motor.

Title: MARS6: A Small and Robust Hierarchical-Codec Text-to-Speech Model
Authors: Matthew Baas, Pieter Scholtz, Arnav Mehta, Elliott Dyson, Akshat Prakash, Herman Kamper
Abstract: Codec-based text-to-speech (TTS) models have shown impressive quality with zero-shot voice cloning abilities. However, they often struggle with more expressive references or complex text inputs. We present MARS6, a robust encoder-decoder transformer for rapid, expressive TTS. MARS6 is built on recent improvements in spoken language modelling. Utilizing a hierarchical setup for its decoder, new speech tokens are processed at a rate of only 12 Hz, enabling efficient modelling of long-form text while retaining reconstruction quality. We combine several recent training and inference techniques to reduce repetitive generation and improve output stability and quality. This enables the 70M-parameter MARS6 to achieve similar performance to models many times larger. We show this in objective and subjective evaluations, comparing TTS output quality and reference speaker cloning ability. Project page: this https URL

Title: Real-Time Integrated Dispatching and Idle Fleet Steering with Deep Reinforcement Learning for A Meal Delivery Platform
Authors: Jingyi Cheng, Shadi Sharif Azadeh
Abstract: To achieve high service quality and profitability, meal delivery platforms like Uber Eats and Grubhub must strategically operate their fleets to ensure timely deliveries for current orders while mitigating the consequential impacts of suboptimal decisions that leads to courier understaffing in the future. This study set out to solve the real-time order dispatching and idle courier steering problems for a meal delivery platform by proposing a reinforcement learning (RL)-based strategic dual-control framework. To address the inherent sequential nature of these problems, we model both order dispatching and courier steering as Markov Decision Processes. Trained via a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, we obtain strategic policies by leveraging the explicitly predicted demands as part of the inputs. In our dual-control framework, the dispatching and steering policies are iteratively trained in an integrated manner. These forward-looking policies can be executed in real-time and provide decisions while jointly considering the impacts on local and network levels. To enhance dispatching fairness, we propose convolutional deep Q networks to construct fair courier embeddings. To simultaneously rebalance the supply and demand within the service network, we propose to utilize mean-field approximated supply-demand knowledge to reallocate idle couriers at the local level. Utilizing the policies generated by the RL-based strategic dual-control framework, we find the delivery efficiency and fairness of workload distribution among couriers have been improved, and under-supplied conditions have been alleviated within the service network. Our study sheds light on designing an RL-based framework to enable forward-looking real-time operations for meal delivery platforms and other on-demand services.

Title: Enhanced sampled-data model predictive control via nonlinear lifting
Authors: Nuthasith Gerdpratoom, Fumiya Matsuzaki, Yutaka Yamamoto, Kaoru Yamamoto
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework that incorporates a lifting technique to enhance control performance for nonlinear systems. While the lifting technique has been widely employed in linear systems to capture intersample behaviour, their application to nonlinear systems remains unexplored. We address this gap by formulating an NMPC scheme that combines fast-sample fast-hold (FSFH) approximations and numerical methods to approximate system dynamics and cost functions. The proposed approach is validated through two case studies: the Van der Pol oscillator and the inverted pendulum on a cart. Simulation results demonstrate that the lifted NMPC outperforms conventional NMPC in terms of reduced settling time and improved control accuracy. These findings underscore the potential of the lifting-based NMPC for efficient control of nonlinear systems, offering a practical solution for real-time applications.

Abstract: This paper evaluates the performance of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) optimization algorithms, which utilize channel estimation methods, in ray tracing (RT) simulations within urban digital twin environments. Beyond Sionna's native capabilities, we implement and benchmark additional RIS optimization algorithms based on channel estimation, enabling an evaluation of RIS strategies under various deployment conditions. Coverage maps for RIS-assisted communication systems are generated through the integration of Sionna's RT simulations. Moreover, real-world experimentation underscores the necessity of validating algorithms in near-realistic simulation environments, as minor variations in measurement setups can significantly affect performance.

Title: User Selection in Near-Field Gigantic MIMO Systems with Modular Arrays
Authors: José P. González-Coma, Santiago Fernández, F. Javier López-Martínez
Abstract: Modular Arrays (MAs) are a promising architecture to enable multi-user communications in next-generation multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems based on extra-large (XL) or gigantic MIMO (gMIMO) deployments, trading off an improved spatial resolution with characteristic interference patterns associated to grating lobes. In this work, we analyze whether MAs can outperform conventional collocated deployments, in terms of achievable sum-rate and served users in a multi-user downlink set-up. First, we provide a rigorous analytical characterization of the inter-user interference for modular gMIMO systems operating in the near field. Then, we leverage these results to optimize the user selection and precoding mechanisms, designing two algorithms that largely outperform existing alternatives in the literature, with different algorithmic complexities. Results show that the proposed algorithms yield over 70% improvements in achievable sum-spectral efficiencies compared to the state of the art. We also illustrate how MAs allow to serve a larger number of users thanks to their improved spatial resolution, compared to the collocated counterpart.

Title: AI-Driven Diabetic Retinopathy Screening: Multicentric Validation of AIDRSS in India
Authors: Amit Kr Dey, Pradeep Walia, Girish Somvanshi, Abrar Ali, Sagarnil Das, Pallabi Paul, Minakhi Ghosh
Abstract: Purpose: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of vision loss, particularly in India, where access to retina specialists is limited in rural areas. This study aims to evaluate the Artificial Intelligence-based Diabetic Retinopathy Screening System (AIDRSS) for DR detection and prevalence assessment, addressing the growing need for scalable, automated screening solutions in resource-limited settings. Approach: A multicentric, cross-sectional study was conducted in Kolkata, India, involving 5,029 participants and 10,058 macula-centric retinal fundus images. The AIDRSS employed a deep learning algorithm with 50 million trainable parameters, integrated with Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) preprocessing for enhanced image quality. DR was graded using the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy (ICDR) Scale, categorizing disease into five stages (DR0 to DR4). Statistical metrics including sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence rates were evaluated against expert retina specialist assessments. Results: The prevalence of DR in the general population was 13.7%, rising to 38.2% among individuals with elevated random blood glucose levels. The AIDRSS achieved an overall sensitivity of 92%, specificity of 88%, and 100% sensitivity for detecting referable DR (DR3 and DR4). These results demonstrate the system's robust performance in accurately identifying and grading DR in a diverse population. Conclusions: AIDRSS provides a reliable, scalable solution for early DR detection in resource-constrained environments. Its integration of advanced AI techniques ensures high diagnostic accuracy, with potential to significantly reduce the burden of diabetes-related vision loss in underserved regions.

Title: Enhanced Acoustic Beamforming with Sub-Aperture Angular Multiply and Sum -- in vivo and in Human Demonstration
Authors: Matthieu Toulemonde, Cameron A. B. Smith, Kai Riemer, Priya Palanisamy, Jaideep Singh Rait, Laura Taylor, Peter D. Weinberg, Karina Cox, Meng-Xing Tang
Abstract: Power Doppler ultrasound is in widespread clinical use for non-invasive vascular imaging but the most common current method - Delay and Sum (DAS) beamforming - suffers from limited resolution and high side-lobes. Here we propose the Sub-Aperture Angular Multiply and Sum (SAMAS) algorithm; it combines the advantages of two recent non-linear beamformers, Frame Multiply and Sum (FMAS) which uses signal temporal coherence and the acoustic sub-aperture (ASAP) algorithm, which uses signal spatial coherence, respectively. Following in vitro experiments to optimise the algorithm, particularly the use of phase information and sub-aperture pairing, it was evaluated in vivo, first in a rabbit kidney and then in human lymph node, using ultrafast ultrasound images obtained with intravenous contrast agents. The SAMAS algorithm improved the CNR and SNR across all tests, on average raising the CNR by 11 dB and the SNR by 18 dB over DAS in vivo. This work demonstrates a promising vascular imaging method that could have widespread clinical utility.

Title: Large Model Empowered Streaming Semantic Communications for Speech Translation
Authors: Zhenzi Weng, Geoffrey Ye Li
Abstract: Semantic communications have been explored to perform downstream intelligent tasks by extracting and transmitting essential information. In this paper, we introduce a large model-empowered streaming semantic communication system for speech translation across various languages, named LaSC-ST. Specifically, we devise an edge-device collaborative semantic communication architecture by offloading the intricate semantic extraction module to edge servers, thereby reducing the computational burden on local devices. To support multilingual speech translation, pre-trained large speech models are utilized to learn unified semantic features from speech in different languages, breaking the constraint of a single input language and enhancing the practicality of the LaSC-ST. Moreover, the input speech is sequentially streamed into the developed system as short speech segments, which enables low transmission latency without the degradation in speech translation quality. A novel dynamic speech segmentation algorithm is proposed to further minimize the transmission latency by adaptively adjusting the duration of speech segments. According to simulation results, the LaSC-ST provides more accurate speech translation and achieves streaming transmission with lower latency compared to existing non-streaming semantic communication systems.

Title: A Practical Demonstration of DRL-Based Dynamic Resource Allocation xApp Using OpenAirInterface
Authors: Onur Sever, Onur Salan, Ibrahim Hokelek, Ali Gorcin
Abstract: Network slicing is a key enabler for providing a differentiated service support to heterogeneous use cases and applications in 5G and beyond networks through creating multiple logical slices. Resource allocation for satisfying diverse requirements of slices is a highly challenging task under time-varying traffic and wireless channel conditions. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for allocating radio resources to slices, where the objective is to meet the latency requirement of the low-latency slice without jeopardizing the performance of the other slice. The proposed DRL approach is implemented within an open source mobile network emulator, namely OpenAirInterface, to create an O-RAN compliant end-to-end 5G network capable of dynamic resource allocation capabilities. The intelligent resource allocation mechanism operates on the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) as an xApp, enabling monitoring and dynamic resource control of the gNB through the E2 interface. The results demonstrate that the latency requirement of the low-latency slice is met under extremely loaded traffic scenarios, where the trained DRL model deployed on the near-RT RIC platform is used to dynamically allocate the radio resources to the slices.

Title: Koopman-Based Model Predictive Control of Functional Electrical Stimulation for Ankle Dorsiflexion and Plantarflexion Assistance
Authors: Mayank Singh, Noor Hakam, Trisha M. Kesar, Nitin Sharma
Abstract: Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) can be an effective tool to augment paretic muscle function and restore normal ankle function. Our approach incorporates a real-time, data-driven Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme, built upon a Koopman operator theory (KOT) framework. This framework adeptly captures the complex nonlinear dynamics of ankle motion in a linearized form, enabling application of linear control approaches for highly nonlinear FES-actuated dynamics. Utilizing inertial measurement units (IMUs), our method accurately predicts the FES-induced ankle movements, while accounting for nonlinear muscle actuation dynamics, including the muscle activation for both plantarflexors, and dorsiflexors (Tibialis Anterior (TA)). The linear prediction model derived through KOT allowed us to formulate the MPC problem with linear state space dynamics, enhancing the real-time feasibility, precision and adaptability of the FES driven control. The effectiveness and applicability of our approach have been demonstrated through comprehensive simulations and experimental trials, including three participants with no disability and a participant with Multiple Sclerosis. Our findings highlight the potential of a KOT-based MPC approach for FES based gait assistance that offers effective and personalized assistance for individuals with gait impairment conditions.

Title: Reusable specimen-level inference in computational pathology
Authors: Jakub R. Kaczmarzyk, Rishul Sharma, Peter K. Koo, Joel H. Saltz
Abstract: Foundation models for computational pathology have shown great promise for specimen-level tasks and are increasingly accessible to researchers. However, specimen-level models built on these foundation models remain largely unavailable, hindering their broader utility and impact. To address this gap, we developed SpinPath, a toolkit designed to democratize specimen-level deep learning by providing a zoo of pretrained specimen-level models, a Python-based inference engine, and a JavaScript-based inference platform. We demonstrate the utility of SpinPath in metastasis detection tasks across nine foundation models. SpinPath may foster reproducibility, simplify experimentation, and accelerate the adoption of specimen-level deep learning in computational pathology research.

Title: Coverage and Spectral Efficiency of NOMA-Enabled LEO Satellite Networks with Ordering Schemes
Authors: Xiangyu Li, Bodong Shang, Qingqing Wu, Chao Ren
Abstract: This paper investigates an analytical model for low-earth orbit (LEO) multi-satellite downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks. The satellites transmit data to multiple NOMA user terminals (UTs), each employing successive interference cancellation (SIC) for decoding. Two ordering schemes are adopted for NOMA-enabled LEO satellite networks, i.e., mean signal power (MSP)-based ordering and instantaneous-signal-to-inter-satellite-interference-plus-noise ratio (ISINR)-based ordering. For each ordering scheme, we derive the coverage probabilities of UTs under different channel conditions. Moreover, we discuss how coverage is influenced by SIC, main-lobe gain, and tradeoffs between the number of satellites and their altitudes. Additionally, two user fairness-based power allocation (PA) schemes are considered, and PA coefficients with the optimal number of UTs that maximize their sum spectral efficiency (SE) are studied. Simulation results show that there exists a maximum signal-to-inter-satellite-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold for each PA scheme that ensures the operation of NOMA in LEO satellite networks, and the benefit of NOMA only exists when the target SINR is below a certain threshold. Compared with orthogonal multiple access (OMA), NOMA increases UTs' sum SE by as much as 35\%. Furthermore, for most SINR thresholds, the sum SE increases with the number of UTs to the highest value, whilst the maximum sum SE is obtained when there are two UTs.

Title: Estimation and Restoration of Unknown Nonlinear Distortion using Diffusion
Authors: Michal Švento, Eloi Moliner, Lauri Juvela, Alec Wright, Vesa Välimäki
Abstract: The restoration of nonlinearly distorted audio signals, alongside the identification of the applied memoryless nonlinear operation, is studied. The paper focuses on the difficult but practically important case in which both the nonlinearity and the original input signal are unknown. The proposed method uses a generative diffusion model trained unconditionally on guitar or speech signals to jointly model and invert the nonlinear system at inference time. Both the memoryless nonlinear function model and the restored audio signal are obtained as output. Successful example case studies are presented including inversion of hard and soft clipping, digital quantization, half-wave rectification, and wavefolding nonlinearities. Our results suggest that, out of the nonlinear functions tested here, the cubic Catmull-Rom spline is best suited to approximating these nonlinearities. In the case of guitar recordings, comparisons with informed and supervised methods show that the proposed blind method is at least as good as they are in terms of objective metrics. Experiments on distorted speech show that the proposed blind method outperforms general-purpose speech enhancement techniques and restores the original voice quality. The proposed method can be applied to audio effects modeling, restoration of music and speech recordings, and characterization of analog recording media.

Title: Low-Resource Text-to-Speech Synthesis Using Noise-Augmented Training of ForwardTacotron
Authors: Kishor Kayyar Lakshminarayana, Frank Zalkow, Christian Dittmar, Nicola Pia, Emanuel A.P. Habets
Abstract: In recent years, several text-to-speech systems have been proposed to synthesize natural speech in zero-shot, few-shot, and low-resource scenarios. However, these methods typically require training with data from many different speakers. The speech quality across the speaker set typically is diverse and imposes an upper limit on the quality achievable for the low-resource speaker. In the current work, we achieve high-quality speech synthesis using as little as five minutes of speech from the desired speaker by augmenting the low-resource speaker data with noise and employing multiple sampling techniques during training. Our method requires only four high-quality, high-resource speakers, which are easy to obtain and use in practice. Our low-complexity method achieves improved speaker similarity compared to the state-of-the-art zero-shot method HierSpeech++ and the recent low-resource method AdapterMix while maintaining comparable naturalness. Our proposed approach can also reduce the data requirements for speech synthesis for new speakers and languages.

Title: Soft-Demapping for Short Reach Optical Communication: A Comparison of Deep Neural Networks and Volterra Series
Authors: Maximilian Schaedler, Georg Böcherer, Stephan Pachnicke
Abstract: In optical fiber communication, optical and electrical components introduce nonlinearities, which require effective compensation to attain highest data rates. In particular, in short reach communication, components are the dominant source of nonlinearities. Volterra series are a popular countermeasure for receiver-side equalization of nonlinear component impairments and their memory effects. However, Volterra equalizer architectures are generally very complex. This article investigates soft deep neural network (DNN) architectures as an alternative for nonlinear equalization and soft-decision demapping. On coherent 92 GBd dual polarization 64QAM back-to-back measurements performance and complexity is experimentally evaluated. The proposed bit-wise soft DNN equalizer (SDNNE) is compared to a 5th order Volterra equalizer at a 15 % overhead forward error correction (FEC) limit. At equal performance, the computational complexity is reduced by 65 %. At equal complexity, the performance is improved by 0.35 dB gain in optical signal-to-noise-ratio (OSNR).

Title: An Attention-Guided Deep Learning Approach for Classifying 39 Skin Lesion Types
Authors: Sauda Adiv Hanum, Ashim Dey, Muhammad Ashad Kabir
Abstract: The skin, as the largest organ of the human body, is vulnerable to a diverse array of conditions collectively known as skin lesions, which encompass various dermatoses. Diagnosing these lesions presents significant challenges for medical practitioners due to the subtle visual differences that are often imperceptible to the naked eye. While not all skin lesions are life-threatening, certain types can act as early indicators of severe diseases, including skin cancers, underscoring the critical need for timely and accurate diagnostic methods. Deep learning algorithms have demonstrated remarkable potential in facilitating the early detection and prognosis of skin lesions. This study advances the field by curating a comprehensive and diverse dataset comprising 39 categories of skin lesions, synthesized from five publicly available datasets. Using this dataset, the performance of five state-of-the-art deep learning models -- MobileNetV2, Xception, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB1, and Vision Transformer - is rigorously evaluated. To enhance the accuracy and robustness of these models, attention mechanisms such as the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) and the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) are incorporated into their architectures. Comprehensive evaluation across multiple performance metrics reveals that the Vision Transformer model integrated with CBAM outperforms others, achieving an accuracy of 93.46%, precision of 94%, recall of 93%, F1-score of 93%, and specificity of 93.67%. These results underscore the significant potential of the proposed system in supporting medical professionals with accurate and efficient prognostic tools for diagnosing a broad spectrum of skin lesions.

Title: On the Interaction in Transient Stability of Two-Inverter Power Systems containing GFL inverter Using Manifold Method
Authors: Yifan Zhang, Yunjie Gu, Yue Zhu, Timothy C. Green, Hsiao-Dong Chiang
Abstract: Many renewable energy resources are integrated into power systems via grid-following (GFL) inverters which rely on a phase-locked loop (PLL) for grid synchronization. During severe grid faults, GFL inverters are vulnerable to transient instability, often leading to disconnection from the grid. This paper aims to elucidate the interaction mechanisms and define the stability boundaries of systems of two inverters, including GFL, grid-forming (GFM), or grid-supporting (GSP) inverters. First, the generalized large-signal expression for the two-inverter system under various inverter combinations is derived, revealing that no energy function exists for systems containing GFL inverters. This implies that the traditional direct method cannot be applied to such systems. To overcome these challenges, a manifold method is employed to precisely determine the domain of attraction (DOA) of the system, and the transient stability margin is assessed by a new metric termed the critical clearing radius (CCR). A case study of the two-inverter system under various inverter combinations is conducted to explore large-signal interactions across different scenarios. Manifold analysis and simulation results reveal that GSP inverters using PLL for grid synchronization exhibit behavior similar to GFM inverters when the droop coefficients in the terminal voltage control loop (TVC) are sufficiently large. Compared to GFL inverters, GSP inverters incorporating a TVC significantly enhances the transient stability of other inverters. In the STATCOM case, the optimal placement of the STATCOM, realized by GSP or GFM inverters, is identified to be at the midpoint of a transmission line. All findings in this paper are validated through electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations

Title: On the Sum Rate and User Fairness of STAR-RIS Aided Communications
Authors: Haochen Li, Xidong Mu, Yuanwei Liu, Yue Chen, Pan Zhiwen
Abstract: A simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) aided communication system is investigated. A robust joint beamforming design problem under the imperfect channel state information (CSI) is formulated to maximize the weighted sum of the Jain's fairness index and the normalized system sum rate. To solve this non-convex problem, an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed, which leverages the S-Procedure, successive convex approximation (SCA), and semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Simulation results demonstrate that with proposed algorithm: 1) various trade-offs between sum rate and user fairness can be achieved; 2) a larger trade-off region can be achieved by adopting STAR-RIS compared to conventional RIS; and 3) the performance degradation caused by imperfect CSI is less than 7% with our proposed robust beamforming approach.

Title: Resiliency metrics quantifying emergency response in a distribution system
Authors: Shikhar Pandey, Gowtham Kandaperumal, Arslan Ahmad, Ian Dobson
Abstract: The electric distribution system is a cornerstone of modern life, playing a critical role in the daily activities and well-being of individuals. As the world transitions toward a decarbonized future, where even mobility relies on electricity, ensuring the resilience of the grid becomes paramount. This paper introduces novel resilience metrics designed to equip utilities and stakeholders with actionable tools to assess performance during storm events. The metrics focus on emergency storm response and the resources required to improve customer service. The practical calculation of the metrics from historical utility data is demonstrated for multiple storm events. Additionally, the metrics' improvement with added crews is estimated by "rerunning history" with faster restoration. By applying this resilience framework, utilities can enhance their restoration strategies and unlock potential cost savings, benefiting both providers and customers in an era of heightened energy dependency.

Title: Multifractal Analysis of Physiological Signals: A Novel Approach to Optimizing Pacing Strategy in a Pilot Study
Authors: Véronique Billat (LAMA), Wejdene Nasr Ben Hadj Amor (LAMA), Guillaume Saës (LAMA), Stéphane Jaffard (LAMA), Florent Palacin (ULB)
Abstract: Marathons are one of the ultimate challenges of human endeavor. In this paper, we apply recently introduced multifractal techniques which yield a new classification parameter in the processing of physiological data captured on marathon runners. The comparison of their values gives a new insight on the way that runners of different level conduct their run, and ultimately, can be used in order to give advice on how to improve their performance.

Title: Decentralized Multi-Antenna Architectures with Unitary Constraints
Authors: Juan Vidal Alegría, Ove Edfors
Abstract: The increase in the number of base station (BS) antennas calls for efficient solutions to deal with the increased interconnection bandwidth and processing complexity of traditional centralized approaches. Decentralized approaches are thus gaining momentum, since they achieve important reductions in data/processing volume by preprocessing the received signals before forwarding them to a central node. The WAX framework offers a general description of decentralized architectures with arbitrary interplay between interconnection bandwidth and decentralized processing complexity, but the applicability of this framework has only been studied assuming unrestricted baseband processing. We consider an adaptation of the WAX framework where the decentralized processing has unitary restriction, which allows for energy-efficient implementations based on reconfigurable impedance networks at the cost of some performance loss. Moreover, we propose an effective method to minimize the performance gap with respect to centralized processing. The previous method gives a first step towards characterizing the information-lossless trade-off between interconnection bandwidth and processing complexity in decentralized architectures with unitary constraints.

Title: Molecular Communication-Inspired Particle Collector-Transmitter (PaCoT) for Heavy Metal Removal from Human Circulatory System
Authors: Hilal Esra Yaldiz, Ozgur B. Akan
Abstract: This study proposes a novel molecular communication (MC)-inspired nanomachine, PArticle COllector-Transmitter (PaCoT), to remove toxic heavy metals from the human circulatory system. PaCoT collects these toxic metals and transmits them to release nodes, such as lymph capillaries, before they reach critical organs. The design incorporates key physical parameters and operates through particle reception and release mechanisms. In the reception process, described as ligand-receptor binding reactions, modeled as a continuous-time Markov process (CTMP), PaCoT uses metallothionein proteins as receptors and heavy metals (e.g., Zn, Pb, Cd) as ligands. We assume that the toxicity condition (toxic (bit-1), non-toxic (bit-0)) is encoded into the concentration of heavy metal molecules. Thus, we consider that heavy metal concentration within the MC channel (e.g., human circulatory system) employs binary concentration shift keying (binary CSK). The concentration ratio of specific heavy metals is estimated to infer toxicity, i.e., a high ratio indicates toxicity and a low ratio suggests non-toxicity. Toxicity detection is achieved by monitoring the receptor bound duration in the presence of interferers and various types of heavy metals. After detecting and collecting toxic heavy metals, PaCoT securely retains them in a liquid medium (e.g., water) until release, employing two mechanisms: (1) a single-disc viscous micropump to regulate flow rate, and (2) Brownian motion to facilitate diffusion. PaCoT's performance is evaluated through MATLAB simulations, focusing on bit error probability (BEP) of the toxicity detection method, release time of molecules from PaCoT and energy consumption.

Title: ELFATT: Efficient Linear Fast Attention for Vision Transformers
Authors: Chong Wu, Maolin Che, Renjie Xu, Zhuoheng Ran, Hong Yan
Abstract: The attention mechanism is the key to the success of transformers in different machine learning tasks. However, the quadratic complexity with respect to the sequence length of the vanilla softmax-based attention mechanism becomes the major bottleneck for the application of long sequence tasks, such as vision tasks. Although various efficient linear attention mechanisms have been proposed, they need to sacrifice performance to achieve high efficiency. What's more, memory-efficient methods, such as FlashAttention-1-3, still have quadratic computation complexity which can be further improved. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient linear fast attention (ELFATT) mechanism to achieve low memory input/output operations, linear computational complexity, and high performance at the same time. ELFATT offers 4-7x speedups over the vanilla softmax-based attention mechanism in high-resolution vision tasks without losing performance. ELFATT is FlashAttention friendly. Using FlashAttention-2 acceleration, ELFATT still offers 2-3x speedups over the vanilla softmax-based attention mechanism on high-resolution vision tasks without losing performance. Even on edge GPUs, ELFATT still offers 1.6x to 2.0x speedups compared to state-of-the-art attention mechanisms in various power modes from 5W to 60W. The code of ELFATT is available at [this https URL].

Title: Weather-Driven Priority Charging for Battery Storage Systems in Hybrid Renewable Energy Grid
Authors: Dhrumil Bhatt, Siddharth Penumatsa, Nirbhay Singhal
Abstract: The integration of renewable energy into the power grid is often hindered by its fragmented infrastructure, leading to inefficient utilization due to the variability of energy production and its reliance on weather conditions. Battery storage systems, while essential for stabilizing energy supply, face challenges like sub-optimal energy distribution, accelerating battery degradation, and reducing operational efficiency. This paper presents a novel solution to these challenges by developing a large-scale, interconnected renewable energy network that optimizes energy storage and distribution. The proposed system includes strategically placed battery storage facilities that stabilize energy production by compensating for fluctuations in renewable output. A priority charging algorithm, informed by real-time weather forecasting and load monitoring, ensures that the most suitable battery systems are charged under varying conditions. Within each storage facility, a secondary priority charging algorithm minimizes battery degradation by ranking batteries based on critical parameters such as state of health (SoH) and state of charge (SoC) and deciding which to charge. This comprehensive approach enhances the efficiency and longevity of battery storage systems, offering a more reliable and resilient renewable energy infrastructure.

Title: Optimizing Experiments for Accurate Battery Circuit Parameters Estimation: Reduction and Adjustment of Frequency Set Used in Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy
Authors: Vladimir Sovljanski, Mario Paolone, Sylvain Tant, Damien Pierre Sainflou
Abstract: In this paper, we study a suitable experimental design of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to reduce the number of frequency points while not significantly affecting the uncertainties of the estimated cell's equivalent circuit model (ECM) parameters. It is based on an E-optimal experimental design that aims to maximize the information about the ECM parameters collected by EIS measurements and, at the same time, minimize the overall uncertainty. In a numerical experiment, we first analyze to which extent reducing the number of measurement points at low frequencies affects the uncertainty of the estimated parameters. Secondly, we show that applying the frequency adjustments can lead to the same or even improved global uncertainty of ECM parameter estimates as with a higher number of measurements. This is numerically verified through a case study using the ECM parameters of a commercial battery cell.

Title: Nonlinear port-Hamiltonian system identification from input-state-output data
Authors: Karim Cherifi, Achraf El Messaoudi, Hannes Gernandt, Marco Roschkowski
Abstract: A framework for identifying nonlinear port-Hamiltonian systems using input-state-output data is introduced. The framework utilizes neural networks' universal approximation capacity to effectively represent complex dynamics in a structured way. We show that using the structure helps to make long-term predictions compared to baselines that do not incorporate physics. We also explore different architectures based on MLPs, KANs, and using prior information. The technique is validated through examples featuring nonlinearities in either the skew-symmetric terms, the dissipative terms, or the Hamiltonian.

Title: PySpatial: A High-Speed Whole Slide Image Pathomics Toolkit
Authors: Yuechen Yang, Yu Wang, Tianyuan Yao, Ruining Deng, Mengmeng Yin, Shilin Zhao, Haichun Yang, Yuankai Huo
Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis plays a crucial role in modern digital pathology, enabling large-scale feature extraction from tissue samples. However, traditional feature extraction pipelines based on tools like CellProfiler often involve lengthy workflows, requiring WSI segmentation into patches, feature extraction at the patch level, and subsequent mapping back to the original WSI. To address these challenges, we present PySpatial, a high-speed pathomics toolkit specifically designed for WSI-level analysis. PySpatial streamlines the conventional pipeline by directly operating on computational regions of interest, reducing redundant processing steps. Utilizing rtree-based spatial indexing and matrix-based computation, PySpatial efficiently maps and processes computational regions, significantly accelerating feature extraction while maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments on two datasets-Perivascular Epithelioid Cell (PEC) and data from the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP)-demonstrate substantial performance improvements. For smaller and sparse objects in PEC datasets, PySpatial achieves nearly a 10-fold speedup compared to standard CellProfiler pipelines. For larger objects, such as glomeruli and arteries in KPMP datasets, PySpatial achieves a 2-fold speedup. These results highlight PySpatial's potential to handle large-scale WSI analysis with enhanced efficiency and accuracy, paving the way for broader applications in digital pathology.

Title: Precoding Design for Limited-Feedback MISO Systems via Character-Polynomial Codes
Authors: Siva Aditya Gooty, Samin Riasat, Hessam Mahdavifar, Robert W. Heath Jr
Abstract: We consider the problem of Multiple-Input Single- Output (MISO) communication with limited feedback, where the transmitter relies on a limited number of bits associated with the channel state information (CSI), available at the receiver (CSIR) but not at the transmitter (no CSIT), sent via the feedback link. We demonstrate how character-polynomial (CP) codes, a class of analog subspace codes (also, referred to as Grassmann codes) can be used for the corresponding quantization problem in the Grassmann space. The proposed CP codebook-based precoding design allows for a smooth trade-off between the number of feedback bits and the beamforming gain, by simply adjusting the rate of the underlying CP code. We present a theoretical upper bound on the mean squared quantization error of the CP codebook, and utilize it to upper bound the resulting distortion as the normalized gap between the CP codebook beamforming gain and the baseline equal gain transmission (EGT) with perfect CSIT. We further show that the distortion vanishes asymptotically. The results are also confirmed via simulations for different types of fading models in the MISO system and various parameters.

Title: Best Response Convergence for Zero-sum Stochastic Dynamic Games with Partial and Asymmetric Information
Authors: Yuxiang Guan, Iman Shames, Tyler H. Summers
Abstract: We analyze best response dynamics for finding a Nash equilibrium of an infinite horizon zero-sum stochastic linear quadratic dynamic game (LQDG) with partial and asymmetric information. We derive explicit expressions for each player's best response within the class of pure linear dynamic output feedback control strategies where the internal state dimension of each control strategy is an integer multiple of the system state dimension. With each best response, the players form increasingly higher-order belief states, leading to infinite-dimensional internal states. However, we observe in extensive numerical experiments that the game's value converges after just a few iterations, suggesting that strategies associated with increasingly higher-order belief states eventually provide no benefit. To help explain this convergence, our numerical analysis reveals rapid decay of the controllability and observability Gramian eigenvalues and Hankel singular values in higher-order belief dynamics, indicating that the higher-order belief dynamics become increasingly difficult for both players to control and observe. Consequently, the higher-order belief dynamics can be closely approximated by low-order belief dynamics with bounded error, and thus feedback strategies with limited internal state dimension can closely approximate a Nash equilibrium.

Title: Modality-Invariant Bidirectional Temporal Representation Distillation Network for Missing Multimodal Sentiment Analysis
Authors: Xincheng Wang, Liejun Wang, Yinfeng Yu, Xinxin Jiao
Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) integrates diverse modalities(text, audio, and video) to comprehensively analyze and understand individuals' emotional states. However, the real-world prevalence of incomplete data poses significant challenges to MSA, mainly due to the randomness of modality missing. Moreover, the heterogeneity issue in multimodal data has yet to be effectively addressed. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Modality-Invariant Bidirectional Temporal Representation Distillation Network (MITR-DNet) for Missing Multimodal Sentiment Analysis. MITR-DNet employs a distillation approach, wherein a complete modality teacher model guides a missing modality student model, ensuring robustness in the presence of modality missing. Simultaneously, we developed the Modality-Invariant Bidirectional Temporal Representation Learning Module (MIB-TRL) to mitigate heterogeneity.

Title: Interpretable deep learning illuminates multiple structures fluorescence imaging: a path toward trustworthy artificial intelligence in microscopy
Authors: Mingyang Chen, Luhong Jin, Xuwei Xuan, Defu Yang, Yun Cheng, Ju Zhang
Abstract: Live-cell imaging of multiple subcellular structures is essential for understanding subcellular dynamics. However, the conventional multi-color sequential fluorescence microscopy suffers from significant imaging delays and limited number of subcellular structure separate labeling, resulting in substantial limitations for real-time live-cell research applications. Here, we present the Adaptive Explainable Multi-Structure Network (AEMS-Net), a deep-learning framework that enables simultaneous prediction of two subcellular structures from a single image. The model normalizes staining intensity and prioritizes critical image features by integrating attention mechanisms and brightness adaptation layers. Leveraging the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, our model decomposes learned features into interpretable univariate functions, enhancing the explainability of complex subcellular morphologies. We demonstrate that AEMS-Net allows real-time recording of interactions between mitochondria and microtubules, requiring only half the conventional sequential-channel imaging procedures. Notably, this approach achieves over 30% improvement in imaging quality compared to traditional deep learning methods, establishing a new paradigm for long-term, interpretable live-cell imaging that advances the ability to explore subcellular dynamics.

Title: Unmasking Deepfakes: Leveraging Augmentations and Features Variability for Deepfake Speech Detection
Authors: Inbal Rimon, Oren Gal, Haim Permuter
Abstract: The detection of deepfake speech has become increasingly challenging with the rapid evolution of deepfake technologies. In this paper, we propose a hybrid architecture for deepfake speech detection, combining a self-supervised learning framework for feature extraction with a classifier head to form an end-to-end model. Our approach incorporates both audio-level and feature-level augmentation techniques. Specifically, we introduce and analyze various masking strategies for augmenting raw audio spectrograms and for enhancing feature representations during training. We incorporate compression augmentations during the pretraining phase of the feature extractor to address the limitations of small, single-language datasets. We evaluate the model on the ASVSpoof5 (ASVSpoof 2024) challenge, achieving state-of-the-art results in Track 1 under closed conditions with an Equal Error Rate of 4.37%. By employing different pretrained feature extractors, the model achieves an enhanced EER of 3.39%. Our model demonstrates robust performance against unseen deepfake attacks and exhibits strong generalization across different codecs.

Title: Switched Optimal Control with Dwell Time Constraints
Authors: Masoud S. Sakha, Rushikesh Kamalapurkar
Abstract: This paper presents an embedding-based approach for solving switched optimal control problems (SOCPs) with dwell time constraints. At first, an embedded optimal control problem (EOCP) is defined by replacing the discrete switching signal with a continuous embedded variable that can take intermediate values between the discrete modes. While embedding enables solutions of SOCPs via conventional techniques, optimal solutions of EOCPs often involve nonexistent modes and thus may not be feasible for the SOCP. In the modified EOCP (MEOCP), a concave function is added to the cost function to enforce a bang-bang solution in the embedded variable, which results in feasible solutions for the SOCP. However, the MEOCP cannot guarantee the satisfaction of dwell-time constraints. In this paper, a MEOCP is combined with a filter layer to remove switching times that violate the dwell time constraint. Insertion gradients are used to minimize the effect of the filter on the optimal cost.

Title: FreeSVC: Towards Zero-shot Multilingual Singing Voice Conversion
Authors: Alef Iury Siqueira Ferreira, Lucas Rafael Gris, Augusto Seben da Rosa, Frederico Santos de Oliveira, Edresson Casanova, Rafael Teixeira Sousa, Arnaldo Candido Junior, Anderson da Silva Soares, Arlindo Galvão Filho
Abstract: This work presents FreeSVC, a promising multilingual singing voice conversion approach that leverages an enhanced VITS model with Speaker-invariant Clustering (SPIN) for better content representation and the State-of-the-Art (SOTA) speaker encoder ECAPA2. FreeSVC incorporates trainable language embeddings to handle multiple languages and employs an advanced speaker encoder to disentangle speaker characteristics from linguistic content. Designed for zero-shot learning, FreeSVC enables cross-lingual singing voice conversion without extensive language-specific training. We demonstrate that a multilingual content extractor is crucial for optimal cross-language conversion. Our source code and models are publicly available.

Title: Regularized Top-$k$: A Bayesian Framework for Gradient Sparsification
Authors: Ali Bereyhi, Ben Liang, Gary Boudreau, Ali Afana
Abstract: Error accumulation is effective for gradient sparsification in distributed settings: initially-unselected gradient entries are eventually selected as their accumulated error exceeds a certain level. The accumulation essentially behaves as a scaling of the learning rate for the selected entries. Although this property prevents the slow-down of lateral movements in distributed gradient descent, it can deteriorate convergence in some settings. This work proposes a novel sparsification scheme that controls the learning rate scaling of error accumulation. The development of this scheme follows two major steps: first, gradient sparsification is formulated as an inverse probability (inference) problem, and the Bayesian optimal sparsification mask is derived as a maximum-a-posteriori estimator. Using the prior distribution inherited from Top-$k$, we derive a new sparsification algorithm which can be interpreted as a regularized form of Top-$k$. We call this algorithm regularized Top-$k$ (RegTop-$k$). It utilizes past aggregated gradients to evaluate posterior statistics of the next aggregation. It then prioritizes the local accumulated gradient entries based on these posterior statistics. We validate our derivation through numerical experiments. In distributed linear regression, it is observed that while Top-$k$ remains at a fixed distance from the global optimum, RegTop-$k$ converges to the global optimum at significantly higher compression ratios. We further demonstrate the generalization of this observation by employing RegTop-$k$ in distributed training of ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10, where it noticeably outperforms Top-$k$.

Title: Fully Decentralized Computation Offloading in Priority-Driven Edge Computing Systems
Authors: Shubham Aggarwal, Melih Bastopcu, Muhammad Aneeq uz Zaman, Tamer Başar, Sennur Ulukus, Nail Akar
Abstract: We develop a novel framework for fully decentralized offloading policy design in multi-access edge computing (MEC) systems. The system comprises $N$ power-constrained user equipments (UEs) assisted by an edge server (ES) to process incoming tasks. Tasks are labeled with urgency flags, and in this paper, we classify them under three urgency levels, namely, high, moderate, and low urgency. We formulate the problem of designing computation decisions for the UEs within a large population noncooperative game framework, where each UE selfishly decides on how to split task execution between its local onboard processor and the ES. We employ the weighted average age of information (AoI) metric to quantify information freshness at the UEs. Increased onboard processing consumes more local power, while increased offloading may potentially incur a higher average AoI due to other UEs' packets being offloaded to the same ES. Thus, we use the mean-field game (MFG) formulation to compute approximate decentralized Nash equilibrium offloading and local computation policies for the UEs to balance between the information freshness and local power consumption. Finally, we provide a projected gradient descent-based algorithm to numerically assess the merits of our approach.

Title: LPRnet: A self-supervised registration network for LiDAR and photogrammetric point clouds
Authors: Chen Wang, Yanfeng Gu, Xian Li
Abstract: LiDAR and photogrammetry are active and passive remote sensing techniques for point cloud acquisition, respectively, offering complementary advantages and heterogeneous. Due to the fundamental differences in sensing mechanisms, spatial distributions and coordinate systems, their point clouds exhibit significant discrepancies in density, precision, noise, and overlap. Coupled with the lack of ground truth for large-scale scenes, integrating the heterogeneous point clouds is a highly challenging task. This paper proposes a self-supervised registration network based on a masked autoencoder, focusing on heterogeneous LiDAR and photogrammetric point clouds. At its core, the method introduces a multi-scale masked training strategy to extract robust features from heterogeneous point clouds under self-supervision. To further enhance registration performance, a rotation-translation embedding module is designed to effectively capture the key features essential for accurate rigid transformations. Building upon the robust representations, a transformer-based architecture seamlessly integrates local and global features, fostering precise alignment across diverse point cloud datasets. The proposed method demonstrates strong feature extraction capabilities for both LiDAR and photogrammetric point clouds, addressing the challenges of acquiring ground truth at the scene level. Experiments conducted on two real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in solving heterogeneous point cloud registration problems.

Title: ExPO: Explainable Phonetic Trait-Oriented Network for Speaker Verification
Authors: Yi Ma, Shuai Wang, Tianchi Liu, Haizhou Li
Abstract: In speaker verification, we use computational method to verify if an utterance matches the identity of an enrolled speaker. This task is similar to the manual task of forensic voice comparison, where linguistic analysis is combined with auditory measurements to compare and evaluate voice samples. Despite much success, we have yet to develop a speaker verification system that offers explainable results comparable to those from manual forensic voice comparison. A novel approach, Explainable Phonetic Trait-Oriented (ExPO) network, is proposed in this paper to introduce the speaker's phonetic trait which describes the speaker's characteristics at the phonetic level, resembling what forensic comparison does. ExPO not only generates utterance-level speaker embeddings but also allows for fine-grained analysis and visualization of phonetic traits, offering an explainable speaker verification process. Furthermore, we investigate phonetic traits from within-speaker and between-speaker variation perspectives to determine which trait is most effective for speaker verification, marking an important step towards explainable speaker verification.

Title: UAV Swarm-enabled Collaborative Post-disaster Communications in Low Altitude Economy via a Two-stage Optimization Approach
Authors: Xiaoya Zheng, Geng Sun, Jiahui Li, Jiacheng Wang, Qingqing Wu, Dusit Niyato, Abbas Jamalipour
Abstract: The low-altitude economy (LAE) plays an indispensable role in cargo transportation, healthcare, infrastructure inspection, and especially post-disaster communication. Specifically, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as one of the core technologies of the LAE, can be deployed to provide communication coverage, facilitate data collection, and relay data for trapped users, thereby significantly enhancing the efficiency of post-disaster response efforts. In this paper, we design an efficient and robust UAV-swarm enabled collaborative self-organizing network to facilitate post-disaster communications. Specifically, a ground device transmits data to UAV swarms, which then use collaborative beamforming (CB) technique to form virtual antenna arrays and relay the data to a remote access point (AP) efficiently. Then, we formulate a rescue-oriented post-disaster transmission rate maximization optimization problem (RPTRMOP). Then, we propose a two-stage optimization approach to address it. In the first stage, the optimal traffic routing and the theoretical upper bound on the transmission rate of the network are derived. In the second stage, we transform the formulated RPTRMOP into a variant named V-RPTRMOP, and a diffusion model-enabled particle swarm optimization (DM-PSO) algorithm is proposed to deal with the V-RPTRMOP. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage optimization approach in improving the transmission rate of the constructed network, which demonstrates the great potential for post-disaster communications. Moreover, the robustness of the constructed network is also validated via evaluating the impact of two unexpected situations on the system transmission rate.

Title: CognoSpeak: an automatic, remote assessment of early cognitive decline in real-world conversational speech
Authors: Madhurananda Pahar, Fuxiang Tao, Bahman Mirheidari, Nathan Pevy, Rebecca Bright, Swapnil Gadgil, Lise Sproson, Dorota Braun, Caitlin Illingworth, Daniel Blackburn, Heidi Christensen
Abstract: The early signs of cognitive decline are often noticeable in conversational speech, and identifying those signs is crucial in dealing with later and more serious stages of neurodegenerative diseases. Clinical detection is costly and time-consuming and although there has been recent progress in the automatic detection of speech-based cues, those systems are trained on relatively small databases, lacking detailed metadata and demographic information. This paper presents CognoSpeak and its associated data collection efforts. CognoSpeak asks memory-probing long and short-term questions and administers standard cognitive tasks such as verbal and semantic fluency and picture description using a virtual agent on a mobile or web platform. In addition, it collects multimodal data such as audio and video along with a rich set of metadata from primary and secondary care, memory clinics and remote settings like people's homes. Here, we present results from 126 subjects whose audio was manually transcribed. Several classic classifiers, as well as large language model-based classifiers, have been investigated and evaluated across the different types of prompts. We demonstrate a high level of performance; in particular, we achieved an F1-score of 0.873 using a DistilBERT model to discriminate people with cognitive impairment (dementia and people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)) from healthy volunteers using the memory responses, fluency tasks and cookie theft picture description. CognoSpeak is an automatic, remote, low-cost, repeatable, non-invasive and less stressful alternative to existing clinical cognitive assessments.

Title: Path Planning for Multi-Copter UAV Formation Employing a Generalized Particle Swarm Optimization
Authors: Van Truong Hoang
Abstract: The paper investigates the problem of path planning techniques for multi-copter uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAV) cooperation in a formation shape to examine surrounding surfaces. We first describe the problem as a joint objective cost for planning a path of the formation centroid working in a complicated space. The path planning algorithm, named the generalized particle swarm optimization algorithm, is then presented to construct an optimal, flyable path while avoiding obstacles and ensuring the flying mission requirements. A path-development scheme is then incorporated to generate a relevant path for each drone to maintain its position in the formation configuration. Simulation, comparison, and experiments have been conducted to verify the proposed approach. Results show the feasibility of the proposed path-planning algorithm with GEPSO.

Title: Orthogonal projection-based regularization for efficient model augmentation
Authors: Bendegúz M. Györök, Jan H. Hoekstra, Johan Kon, Tamás Péni, Maarten Schoukens, Roland Tóth
Abstract: Deep-learning-based nonlinear system identification has shown the ability to produce reliable and highly accurate models in practice. However, these black-box models lack physical interpretability, and often a considerable part of the learning effort is spent on capturing already expected/known behavior due to first-principles-based understanding of some aspects of the system. A potential solution is to integrate prior physical knowledge directly into the model structure, combining the strengths of physics-based modeling and deep-learning-based identification. The most common approach is to use an additive model augmentation structure, where the physics-based and the machine-learning (ML) components are connected in parallel. However, such models are overparametrized, training them is challenging, potentially causing the physics-based part to lose interpretability. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes an orthogonal projection-based regularization technique to enhance parameter learning, convergence, and even model accuracy in learning-based augmentation of nonlinear baseline models.

Title: Swin-X2S: Reconstructing 3D Shape from 2D Biplanar X-ray with Swin Transformers
Authors: Kuan Liu, Zongyuan Ying, Jie Jin, Dongyan Li, Ping Huang, Wenjian Wu, Zhe Chen, Jin Qi, Yong Lu, Lianfu Deng, Bo Chen
Abstract: The conversion from 2D X-ray to 3D shape holds significant potential for improving diagnostic efficiency and safety. However, existing reconstruction methods often rely on hand-crafted features, manual intervention, and prior knowledge, resulting in unstable shape errors and additional processing costs. In this paper, we introduce Swin-X2S, an end-to-end deep learning method for directly reconstructing 3D segmentation and labeling from 2D biplanar orthogonal X-ray images. Swin-X2S employs an encoder-decoder architecture: the encoder leverages 2D Swin Transformer for X-ray information extraction, while the decoder employs 3D convolution with cross-attention to integrate structural features from orthogonal views. A dimension-expanding module is introduced to bridge the encoder and decoder, ensuring a smooth conversion from 2D pixels to 3D voxels. We evaluate proposed method through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments across nine publicly available datasets covering four anatomies (femur, hip, spine, and rib), with a total of 54 categories. Significant improvements over previous methods have been observed not only in the segmentation and labeling metrics but also in the clinically relevant parameters that are of primary concern in practical applications, which demonstrates the promise of Swin-X2S to provide an effective option for anatomical shape reconstruction in clinical scenarios. Code implementation is available at: \url{this https URL}.

Title: Towards Early Prediction of Self-Supervised Speech Model Performance
Authors: Ryan Whetten, Lucas Maison, Titouan Parcollet, Marco Dinarelli, Yannick Estève
Abstract: In Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), pre-training and evaluation are resource intensive. In the speech domain, current indicators of the quality of SSL models during pre-training, such as the loss, do not correlate well with downstream performance. Consequently, it is often difficult to gauge the final downstream performance in a cost efficient manner during pre-training. In this work, we propose unsupervised efficient methods that give insights into the quality of the pre-training of SSL speech models, namely, measuring the cluster quality and rank of the embeddings of the SSL model. Results show that measures of cluster quality and rank correlate better with downstream performance than the pre-training loss with only one hour of unlabeled audio, reducing the need for GPU hours and labeled data in SSL model evaluation.

Title: Deep Variational Sequential Monte Carlo for High-Dimensional Observations
Authors: Wessel L. van Nierop, Nir Shlezinger, Ruud J.G. van Sloun
Abstract: Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), or particle filtering, is widely used in nonlinear state-space systems, but its performance often suffers from poorly approximated proposal and state-transition distributions. This work introduces a differentiable particle filter that leverages the unsupervised variational SMC objective to parameterize the proposal and transition distributions with a neural network, designed to learn from high-dimensional observations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms established baselines in tracking the challenging Lorenz attractor from high-dimensional and partial observations. Furthermore, an evidence lower bound based evaluation indicates that our method offers a more accurate representation of the posterior distribution.

Title: Comparing Self-Supervised Learning Models Pre-Trained on Human Speech and Animal Vocalizations for Bioacoustics Processing
Authors: Eklavya Sarkar, Mathew Magimai.-Doss
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) foundation models have emerged as powerful, domain-agnostic, general-purpose feature extractors applicable to a wide range of tasks. Such models pre-trained on human speech have demonstrated high transferability for bioacoustic processing. This paper investigates (i) whether SSL models pre-trained directly on animal vocalizations offer a significant advantage over those pre-trained on speech, and (ii) whether fine-tuning speech-pretrained models on automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks can enhance bioacoustic classification. We conduct a comparative analysis using three diverse bioacoustic datasets and two different bioacoustic tasks. Results indicate that pre-training on bioacoustic data provides only marginal improvements over speech-pretrained models, with comparable performance in most scenarios. Fine-tuning on ASR tasks yields mixed outcomes, suggesting that the general-purpose representations learned during SSL pre-training are already well-suited for bioacoustic tasks. These findings highlight the robustness of speech-pretrained SSL models for bioacoustics and imply that extensive fine-tuning may not be necessary for optimal performance.

Title: Investigating the Impact of Observation Space Design Choices On Training Reinforcement Learning Solutions for Spacecraft Problems
Authors: Nathaniel Hamilton, Kyle Dunlap, Kerianne L Hobbs
Abstract: Recent research using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn autonomous control for spacecraft operations has shown great success. However, a recent study showed their performance could be improved by changing the action space, i.e. control outputs, used in the learning environment. This has opened the door for finding more improvements through further changes to the environment. The work in this paper focuses on how changes to the environment's observation space can impact the training and performance of RL agents learning the spacecraft inspection task. The studies are split into two groups. The first looks at the impact of sensors that were designed to help agents learn the task. The second looks at the impact of reference frames, reorienting the agent to see the world from a different perspective. The results show the sensors are not necessary, but most of them help agents learn more optimal behavior, and that the reference frame does not have a large impact, but is best kept consistent.

Title: BRIGHT: A globally distributed multimodal building damage assessment dataset with very-high-resolution for all-weather disaster response
Authors: Hongruixuan Chen, Jian Song, Olivier Dietrich, Clifford Broni-Bediako, Weihao Xuan, Junjue Wang, Xinlei Shao, Yimin Wei, Junshi Xia, Cuiling Lan, Konrad Schindler, Naoto Yokoya
Abstract: Disaster events occur around the world and cause significant damage to human life and property. Earth observation (EO) data enables rapid and comprehensive building damage assessment (BDA), an essential capability in the aftermath of a disaster to reduce human casualties and to inform disaster relief efforts. Recent research focuses on the development of AI models to achieve accurate mapping of unseen disaster events, mostly using optical EO data. However, solutions based on optical data are limited to clear skies and daylight hours, preventing a prompt response to disasters. Integrating multimodal (MM) EO data, particularly the combination of optical and SAR imagery, makes it possible to provide all-weather, day-and-night disaster responses. Despite this potential, the development of robust multimodal AI models has been constrained by the lack of suitable benchmark datasets. In this paper, we present a BDA dataset using veRy-hIGH-resoluTion optical and SAR imagery (BRIGHT) to support AI-based all-weather disaster response. To the best of our knowledge, BRIGHT is the first open-access, globally distributed, event-diverse MM dataset specifically curated to support AI-based disaster response. It covers five types of natural disasters and two types of man-made disasters across 12 regions worldwide, with a particular focus on developing countries where external assistance is most needed. The optical and SAR imagery in BRIGHT, with a spatial resolution between 0.3-1 meters, provides detailed representations of individual buildings, making it ideal for precise BDA. In our experiments, we have tested seven advanced AI models trained with our BRIGHT to validate the transferability and robustness. The dataset and code are available at this https URL. BRIGHT also serves as the official dataset for the 2025 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest.

Title: The improvement in transmission resilience metrics from reduced outages or faster restoration can be calculated by rerunning historical outage data
Authors: Arslan Ahmad, Ian Dobson, Svetlana Ekisheva, Christopher Claypool
Abstract: Transmission utilities routinely collect detailed outage data, including resilience events in which outages bunch up due to weather. The resilience events and their resilience metrics can readily be extracted from this historical outage data. Improvements such as grid hardening or investments in restoration lead to reduced outages or faster restoration. We show how to rerun this history with the effects of the reduced outages or faster restoration included to find the resulting improvement in resilience metrics, thus quantifying the benefits of these investments. This is demonstrated with case studies for specific events (a derecho and a hurricane), and all large events or large thunderstorms in the Midwest USA. Instead of predicting future extreme events with models, which is very challenging, the historical rerun readily quantifies the benefits that a resilience investment would have had if it had been made in the past. The historical rerun is particularly vivid in making the case for resilience investments to stakeholders because it quantifies the benefits for events actually experienced by those stakeholders, rather than for future events predicted with uncertainty.

Title: B1+ mapping near metallic implants using turbo spin echo pulse sequences
Authors: Iman Khodarahmi, Mary Bruno, Ran Schwarzkopf, Jan Fritz, Mahesh B. Keerthivasan
Abstract: Purpose: To propose a B1+ mapping technique for imaging of body parts containing metal hardware, based on magnitude images acquired with turbo spin echo (TSE) pulse sequences. Theory and Methods: To encode the underlying B1+, multiple (two to four) TSE image sets with various excitation and refocusing flip angles were acquired. To this end, the acquired signal intensities were matched to a database of simulated signals which was generated by solving the Bloch equations taking into account the exact sequence parameters. The retrieved B1+ values were validated against gradient-recalled and spin echo dual angle methods, as well as a vendor-provided turboFLASH-based mapping sequence, in gel phantoms and human subjects without and with metal implants. Results: In the absence of metal, phantom experiments demonstrated excellent agreement between the proposed technique using three or four flip angle sets and reference dual angle methods. In human subjects without metal implants, the proposed technique with three or four flip angle sets showed excellent correlation with the spin echo dual angle method. In the presence of metal, both phantoms and human subjects revealed a narrow range of B1+ estimation with the reference techniques, whereas the proposed technique successfully resolved B1+ near the metal. In select cases, the technique was implemented in conjunction with multispectral metal artifact reduction sequences and successfully applied for B1+ shimming. Conclusion: The proposed technique enables resolution of B1+ values in regions near metal hardware, overcoming susceptibility-related and narrow-range limitations of standard mapping techniques.

Title: Benchmarking Rotary Position Embeddings for Automatic Speech Recognition
Authors: Shucong Zhang, Titouan Parcollet, Rogier van Dalen, Sourav Bhattacharya
Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) encodes relative and absolute positional information in Transformer-based models through rotation matrices applied to input vectors within sequences. While RoPE has demonstrated superior performance compared to other positional embedding technologies in natural language processing tasks, its effectiveness in speech processing applications remains understudied. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of RoPE across diverse automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that for ASR tasks, RoPE consistently achieves lower error rates compared to the currently widely used relative positional embedding. To facilitate further research, we release the implementation and all experimental recipes through the SpeechBrain toolkit.

Title: Distilling Calibration via Conformalized Credal Inference
Authors: Jiayi Huang, Sangwoo Park, Nicola Paoletti, Osvaldo Simeone
Abstract: Deploying artificial intelligence (AI) models on edge devices involves a delicate balance between meeting stringent complexity constraints, such as limited memory and energy resources, and ensuring reliable performance in sensitive decision-making tasks. One way to enhance reliability is through uncertainty quantification via Bayesian inference. This approach, however, typically necessitates maintaining and running multiple models in an ensemble, which may exceed the computational limits of edge devices. This paper introduces a low-complexity methodology to address this challenge by distilling calibration information from a more complex model. In an offline phase, predictive probabilities generated by a high-complexity cloud-based model are leveraged to determine a threshold based on the typical divergence between the cloud and edge models. At run time, this threshold is used to construct credal sets -- ranges of predictive probabilities that are guaranteed, with a user-selected confidence level, to include the predictions of the cloud model. The credal sets are obtained through thresholding of a divergence measure in the simplex of predictive probabilities. Experiments on visual and language tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach, termed Conformalized Distillation for Credal Inference (CD-CI), significantly improves calibration performance compared to low-complexity Bayesian methods, such as Laplace approximation, making it a practical and efficient solution for edge AI deployments.

Title: Towards Developing Socially Compliant Automated Vehicles: State of the Art, Experts Expectations, and A Conceptual Framework
Authors: Yongqi Dong, Bart van Arem, Haneen Farah
Abstract: Automated Vehicles (AVs) hold promise for revolutionizing transportation by improving road safety, traffic efficiency, and overall mobility. Despite the steady advancement in high-level AVs in recent years, the transition to full automation entails a period of mixed traffic, where AVs of varying automation levels coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Making AVs socially compliant and understood by human drivers is expected to improve the safety and efficiency of mixed traffic. Thus, ensuring AVs compatibility with HDVs and social acceptance is crucial for their successful and seamless integration into mixed traffic. However, research in this critical area of developing Socially Compliant AVs (SCAVs) remains sparse. This study carries out the first comprehensive scoping review to assess the current state of the art in developing SCAVs, identifying key concepts, methodological approaches, and research gaps. An expert interview was also conducted to identify critical research gaps and expectations towards SCAVs. Based on the scoping review and expert interview input, a conceptual framework is proposed for the development of SCAVs. The conceptual framework is evaluated using an online survey targeting researchers, technicians, policymakers, and other relevant professionals worldwide. The survey results provide valuable validation and insights, affirming the significance of the proposed conceptual framework in tackling the challenges of integrating AVs into mixed-traffic environments. Additionally, future research perspectives and suggestions are discussed, contributing to the research and development agenda of SCAVs.

Title: Vehicle-in-Virtual-Environment (VVE) Based Autonomous Driving Function Development and Evaluation Methodology for Vulnerable Road User Safety
Authors: Haochong Chen, Xincheng Cao, Levent Guvenc, Bilin Aksun Guvenc
Abstract: Traditional methods for developing and evaluating autonomous driving functions, such as model-in-the-loop (MIL) and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations, heavily depend on the accuracy of simulated vehicle models and human factors, especially for vulnerable road user safety systems. Continuation of development during public road deployment forces other road users including vulnerable ones to involuntarily participate in the development process, leading to safety risks, inefficiencies, and a decline in public trust. To address these deficiencies, the Vehicle-in-Virtual-Environment (VVE) method was proposed as a safer, more efficient, and cost-effective solution for developing and testing connected and autonomous driving technologies by operating the real vehicle and multiple other actors like vulnerable road users in different test areas while being immersed within the same highly realistic virtual environment. This VVE approach synchronizes real-world vehicle and vulnerable road user motion within the same virtual scenario, enabling the safe and realistic testing of various traffic situations in a safe and repeatable manner. In this paper, we propose a new testing pipeline that sequentially integrates MIL, HIL, and VVE methods to comprehensively develop and evaluate autonomous driving functions. The effectiveness of this testing pipeline will be demonstrated using an autonomous driving path-tracking algorithm with local deep reinforcement learning modification for vulnerable road user collision avoidance.

Title: Development of an Advisory System for Parking of a Car and Trailer
Authors: Xincheng Cao, Haochong Chen, Bilin Aksun Guvenc, Levent Guvenc, Shihong Fan, John Harber, Brian Link, Peter Richmond, Dokyung Yim
Abstract: Trailer parking is a challenging task due to the unstable nature of the vehicle-trailer system in reverse motion and the unintuitive steering actions required at the vehicle to accomplish the parking maneuver. This paper presents a strategy to tackle this kind of maneuver with an advisory graphic aid to help the human driver with the task of manually backing up the vehicle-trailer system. A kinematic vehicle-trailer model is derived to describe the low-speed motion of the vehicle-trailer system, and its inverse kinematics is established by generating an equivalent virtual trailer axle steering command. The advisory system graphics is generated based on the inverse kinematics and displays the expected trailer orientation given the current vehicle steer angle and configuration (hitch angle). Simulation study and animation are set up to test the efficacy of the approach, where the user can select both vehicle speed and vehicle steering angle freely, which allows the user to stop the vehicle-trailer system and experiment with different steering inputs to see their effect on the predicted trailer motion before proceeding with the best one according to the advisory graphics, hence creating a series of piecewise continuous control actions similar to how manual trailer reverse parking is usually carried out. The advisory graphics proves to provide the driver with an intuitive understanding of the trailer motion at any given configuration (hitch angle).

Title: xLSTM-SENet: xLSTM for Single-Channel Speech Enhancement
Authors: Nikolai Lund Kühne, Jan Østergaard, Jesper Jensen, Zheng-Hua Tan
Abstract: While attention-based architectures, such as Conformers, excel in speech enhancement, they face challenges such as scalability with respect to input sequence length. In contrast, the recently proposed Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) architecture offers linear scalability. However, xLSTM-based models remain unexplored for speech enhancement. This paper introduces xLSTM-SENet, the first xLSTM-based single-channel speech enhancement system. A comparative analysis reveals that xLSTM-and notably, even LSTM-can match or outperform state-of-the-art Mamba- and Conformer-based systems across various model sizes in speech enhancement on the VoiceBank+Demand dataset. Through ablation studies, we identify key architectural design choices such as exponential gating and bidirectionality contributing to its effectiveness. Our best xLSTM-based model, xLSTM-SENet2, outperforms state-of-the-art Mamba- and Conformer-based systems on the Voicebank+DEMAND dataset.

Title: Meta-Learning for Physically-Constrained Neural System Identification
Authors: Ankush Chakrabarty, Gordon Wichern, Vedang M. Deshpande, Abraham P. Vinod, Karl Berntorp, Christopher R. Laughman
Abstract: We present a gradient-based meta-learning framework for rapid adaptation of neural state-space models (NSSMs) for black-box system identification. When applicable, we also incorporate domain-specific physical constraints to improve the accuracy of the NSSM. The major benefit of our approach is that instead of relying solely on data from a single target system, our framework utilizes data from a diverse set of source systems, enabling learning from limited target data, as well as with few online training iterations. Through benchmark examples, we demonstrate the potential of our approach, study the effect of fine-tuning subnetworks rather than full fine-tuning, and report real-world case studies to illustrate the practical application and generalizability of the approach to practical problems with physical-constraints. Specifically, we show that the meta-learned models result in improved downstream performance in model-based state estimation in indoor localization and energy systems.

Title: GR-WiFi: A GNU Radio based WiFi Platform with Single-User and Multi-User MIMO Capability
Authors: Natong Lin, Zelin Yun, Shengli Zhou, Song Han
Abstract: Since its first release, WiFi has been highly successful in providing wireless local area networks. The ever-evolving IEEE 802.11 standards continue to add new features to keep up with the trend of increasing numbers of mobile devices and the growth of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Unfortunately, the lack of open-source IEEE 802.11 testbeds in the community limits the development and performance evaluation of those new features. Motivated by an existing popular open-source software-defined radio (SDR) package for single-user single-stream transmission based on the IEEE 802.11/a/g/p standard, in this paper we present GR-WiFi, an open-source package for single-user and multi-user multi-input multi-output (MIMO) transmissions based on 802.11n and 802.11ac standards. The distinct features of GR-WiFi include the support of parallel data streams to single or multiple users, and the compatible preamble processing to allow the co-existence of conventional, high-throughput (HT) and very-high-throughput (VHT) traffics. The performance of GR-WiFi is evaluated through both extensive simulation and real-world experiments.

Title: Diffusion-Based Audio Inpainting
Authors: Eloi Moliner, Vesa Välimäki
Abstract: Audio inpainting aims to reconstruct missing segments in corrupted recordings. Most of existing methods produce plausible reconstructions when the gap lengths are short, but struggle to reconstruct gaps larger than about 100 ms. This paper explores recent advancements in deep learning and, particularly, diffusion models, for the task of audio inpainting. The proposed method uses an unconditionally trained generative model, which can be conditioned in a zero-shot fashion for audio inpainting, and is able to regenerate gaps of any size. An improved deep neural network architecture based on the constant-Q transform, which allows the model to exploit pitch-equivariant symmetries in audio, is also presented. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through objective and subjective metrics for the task of reconstructing short to mid-sized gaps, up to 300 ms. The results of a formal listening test show that the proposed method delivers comparable performance against the compared baselines for short gaps, such as 50 ms, while retaining a good audio quality and outperforming the baselines for wider gaps that are up to 300 ms long. The method presented in this paper can be applied to restoring sound recordings that suffer from severe local disturbances or dropouts, which must be reconstructed.

Title: Empowering Aggregators with Practical Data-Driven Tools: Harnessing Aggregated and Disaggregated Flexibility for Demand Response
Authors: Costas Mylonas, Donata Boric, Leila Luttenberger Maric, Alexandros Tsitsanis, Eleftheria Petrianou, Magda Foti
Abstract: This study explores the interaction between aggregators and building occupants in activating flexibility through Demand Response (DR) programs, with a focus on reinforcing the resilience of the energy system considering the uncertainties presented by Renewable Energy Sources (RES). Firstly, it introduces a methodology of optimizing aggregated flexibility provision strategies in environments with limited data, utilizing Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT) and clustering techniques to identify building occupants' activity patterns. Secondly, the study assesses the disaggregated flexibility provision of Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems during DR events, employing machine learning and optimization techniques for precise, device-level analysis. The first approach offers a non-intrusive pathway for aggregators to provide flexibility services in environments of a single smart meter for the whole building's consumption, while the second approach maximizes the amount of flexibility in the case of dedicated metering devices to the HVAC systems by carefully considering building occupants' thermal comfort profiles. Through the application of data-driven techniques and encompassing case studies from both industrial and residential buildings, this paper not only unveils pivotal opportunities for aggregators in the balancing and emerging flexibility markets but also successfully develops and demonstrates end-to-end practical tools for aggregators.

Title: Hybrid Fusion for 802.11ax Wi-Fi-based Passive Radars Exploiting Beamforming Feedbacks
Authors: Martin Willame, Hasan Can Yildirim, Laurent Storrer, Francois Horlin, Jerome Louveaux
Abstract: Passive Wi-Fi-based radars (PWRs) are devices that enable the localization of targets using Wi-Fi signals of opportunity transmitted by an access point. Unlike active radars that optimize their transmitted waveform for localization, PWRs align with the 802.11 amendments. Specifically, during the channel sounding session preceding a multi-user multiple-input multiple-output downlink transmission, an access point isotropically transmits a null data packet (NDP) with a known preamble. From these known symbols, client user equipments derive their channel state information and transmit an unencrypted beamforming feedback (BFF) back to the access point. The BFF comprises the right singular matrix of the channel and the corresponding stream gain for each subcarrier, which allows the computation of a beamforming matrix at the access point. In a classical PWR processing, only the preamble symbols from the NDP are exploited during the channel sounding session. In this study, we investigate multiple target localization by a PWR exploiting hybrid information sources. On one hand, the joint angle-of-departure and angle-of-arrival evaluated from the NDP. On another hand, the line-of-sight angle-of-departures inferred from the BFFs. The processing steps at the PWR are defined and an optimal hybrid fusion rule is derived in the maximum likelihood framework. Monte-Carlo simulations assess the enhanced accuracy of the proposed combination method compared to classical PWR processing based solely on the NDP, and compare the localisation performance between client and non-client targets.

Title: Remaining Discharge Energy Prediction for Lithium-Ion Batteries Over Broad Current Ranges: A Machine Learning Approach
Authors: Hao Tu, Manashita Borah, Scott Moura, Yebin Wang, Huazhen Fang
Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries have found their way into myriad sectors of industry to drive electrification, decarbonization, and sustainability. A crucial aspect in ensuring their safe and optimal performance is monitoring their energy levels. In this paper, we present the first study on predicting the remaining energy of a battery cell undergoing discharge over wide current ranges from low to high C-rates. The complexity of the challenge arises from the cell's C-rate-dependent energy availability as well as its intricate electro-thermal dynamics especially at high C-rates. To address this, we introduce a new definition of remaining discharge energy and then undertake a systematic effort in harnessing the power of machine learning to enable its prediction. Our effort includes two parts in cascade. First, we develop an accurate dynamic model based on integration of physics with machine learning to capture a battery's voltage and temperature behaviors. Second, based on the model, we propose a machine learning approach to predict the remaining discharge energy under arbitrary C-rates and pre-specified cut-off limits in voltage and temperature. The experimental validation shows that the proposed approach can predict the remaining discharge energy with a relative error of less than 3% when the current varies between 0~8 C for an NCA cell and 0~15 C for an LFP cell. The approach, by design, is amenable to training and computation.

Title: Log-Scale Quantization in Distributed First-Order Methods: Gradient-based Learning from Distributed Data
Authors: Mohammadreza Doostmohammadian, Muhammad I. Qureshi, Mohammad Hossein Khalesi, Hamid R. Rabiee, Usman A. Khan
Abstract: Decentralized strategies are of interest for learning from large-scale data over networks. This paper studies learning over a network of geographically distributed nodes/agents subject to quantization. Each node possesses a private local cost function, collectively contributing to a global cost function, which the considered methodology aims to minimize. In contrast to many existing papers, the information exchange among nodes is log-quantized to address limited network-bandwidth in practical situations. We consider a first-order computationally efficient distributed optimization algorithm (with no extra inner consensus loop) that leverages node-level gradient correction based on local data and network-level gradient aggregation only over nearby nodes. This method only requires balanced networks with no need for stochastic weight design. It can handle log-scale quantized data exchange over possibly time-varying and switching network setups. We study convergence over both structured networks (for example, training over data-centers) and ad-hoc multi-agent networks (for example, training over dynamic robotic networks). Through experimental validation, we show that (i) structured networks generally result in a smaller optimality gap, and (ii) log-scale quantization leads to a smaller optimality gap compared to uniform quantization.

Title: Separate and Reconstruct: Asymmetric Encoder-Decoder for Speech Separation
Authors: Ui-Hyeop Shin, Sangyoun Lee, Taehan Kim, Hyung-Min Park
Abstract: In speech separation, time-domain approaches have successfully replaced the time-frequency domain with latent sequence feature from a learnable encoder. Conventionally, the feature is separated into speaker-specific ones at the final stage of the network. Instead, we propose a more intuitive strategy that separates features earlier by expanding the feature sequence to the number of speakers as an extra dimension. To achieve this, an asymmetric strategy is presented in which the encoder and decoder are partitioned to perform distinct processing in separation tasks. The encoder analyzes features, and the output of the encoder is split into the number of speakers to be separated. The separated sequences are then reconstructed by the weight-shared decoder, which also performs cross-speaker processing. Without relying on speaker information, the weight-shared network in the decoder directly learns to discriminate features using a separation objective. In addition, to improve performance, traditional methods have extended the sequence length, leading to the adoption of dual-path models, which handle the much longer sequence effectively by segmenting it into chunks. To address this, we introduce global and local Transformer blocks that can directly handle long sequences more efficiently without chunking and dual-path processing. The experimental results demonstrated that this asymmetric structure is effective and that the combination of proposed global and local Transformer can sufficiently replace the role of inter- and intra-chunk processing in dual-path structure. Finally, the presented model combining both of these achieved state-of-the-art performance with much less computation in various benchmark datasets.

Title: Exploring Text-Queried Sound Event Detection with Audio Source Separation
Authors: Han Yin, Jisheng Bai, Yang Xiao, Hui Wang, Siqi Zheng, Yafeng Chen, Rohan Kumar Das, Chong Deng, Jianfeng Chen
Abstract: In sound event detection (SED), overlapping sound events pose a significant challenge, as certain events can be easily masked by background noise or other events, resulting in poor detection performance. To address this issue, we propose the text-queried SED (TQ-SED) framework. Specifically, we first pre-train a language-queried audio source separation (LASS) model to separate the audio tracks corresponding to different events from the input audio. Then, multiple target SED branches are employed to detect individual events. AudioSep is a state-of-the-art LASS model, but has limitations in extracting dynamic audio information because of its pure convolutional structure for separation. To address this, we integrate a dual-path recurrent neural network block into the model. We refer to this structure as AudioSep-DP, which achieves the first place in DCASE 2024 Task 9 on language-queried audio source separation (objective single model track). Experimental results show that TQ-SED can significantly improve the SED performance, with an improvement of 7.22\% on F1 score over the conventional framework. Additionally, we setup comprehensive experiments to explore the impact of model complexity. The source code and pre-trained model are released at this https URL.

Title: Self-Supervised Masked Mesh Learning for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection on 3D Cortical Surfaces
Authors: Hao-Chun Yang, Sicheng Dai, Saige Rutherford, Christian Gaser, Andre F Marquand, Christian F Beckmann, Thomas Wolfers
Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection in brain imaging is challenging. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised masked mesh learning for unsupervised anomaly detection in 3D cortical surfaces. Our framework leverages the intrinsic geometry of the cortical surface to learn a self-supervised representation that captures the underlying structure of the brain. We introduce a masked mesh convolutional neural network (MMN) that learns to predict masked regions of the cortical surface. By training the MMN on a large dataset of healthy subjects, we learn a representation that captures the normal variation in the cortical surface. We then use this representation to detect anomalies in unseen individuals by calculating anomaly scores based on the reconstruction error of the MMN. We evaluate our framework by training on population-scale dataset UKB and HCP-Aging and testing on two datasets of Alzheimer's disease patients ADNI and OASIS3. Our results show that our framework can detect anomalies in cortical thickness, cortical volume, and cortical sulcus features, which are known to be sensitive biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. Our proposed framework provides a promising approach for unsupervised anomaly detection based on normative variation of cortical features.

Title: Privacy-Preserving Distributed Defense Framework for DC Microgrids Against Exponentially Unbounded False Data Injection Attacks
Authors: Yi Zhang, Mohamadamin Rajabinezhad, Yichao Wang, Junbo Zhao, Shan Zuo
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel, fully distributed control framework for DC microgrids, enhancing resilience against exponentially unbounded false data injection (EU-FDI) attacks. Our framework features a consensus-based secondary control for each converter, effectively addressing these advanced threats. To further safeguard sensitive operational data, a privacy-preserving mechanism is incorporated into the control design, ensuring that critical information remains secure even under adversarial conditions. Rigorous Lyapunov stability analysis confirms the framework's ability to maintain critical DC microgrid operations like voltage regulation and load sharing under EU-FDI threats. The framework's practicality is validated through hardware-in-the-loop experiments, demonstrating its enhanced resilience and robust privacy protection against the complex challenges posed by quick variant FDI attacks.

Title: SMTL: A Stratified Logic for Expressive Multi-Level Temporal Specifications
Authors: Ali Baheri, Peng Wei
Abstract: We present Stratified Metric Temporal Logic (SMTL), a novel formalism for specifying and verifying properties of complex cyber-physical systems that exhibit behaviors across multiple temporal and abstraction scales. SMTL extends existing temporal logics by incorporating a stratification operator, enabling the association of temporal properties with specific abstraction levels. This allows for the natural expression of multi-scale requirements while maintaining formal reasoning about inter-level relationships. We formalize the syntax and semantics of SMTL, proving that it strictly subsumes metric temporal logic (MTL) and offers enhanced expressiveness by capturing properties unattainable in existing logics. Numerical simulations comparing agents operating under MTL and SMTL specifications show that SMTL enhances agent coordination and safety, reducing collision rates without substantial computational overhead or compromising path efficiency. These findings underscore SMTL's potential as a valuable tool for designing and verifying complex multi-agent systems operating across diverse temporal and abstraction scales.

Title: Optimizing Audio Compression Through Entropy-Controlled Dithering
Authors: Ellison Murray, Morriel Kasher, Predrag Spasojevic
Abstract: This paper explores entropy-controlled dithering techniques in audio compression, examining the application of standard and modified TPDFs, combined with noise shaping and entropy-controlled parameters, across various audio contexts, including pitch, loudness, rhythm, and instrumentation variations. Perceptual quality metrics such as VISQOL and STOI were used to evaluate performance. The results demonstrate that TPDF-based dithering consistently outperforms RPDF, particularly under optimal alpha conditions, while highlighting performance variability based on signal characteristics. These findings suggest the situational appropriateness of using various TPDF distributions. This work emphasizes the trade-off between entropy and perceptual fidelity, offering insights into the potential of entropy-controlled dithering as a foundation for enhanced audio compression algorithms. A practical implementation as a Digital Audio Workstation plugin introduces customizable dithering controls, laying the groundwork for future advancements in audio compression algorithms.

Title: Dr. Tongue: Sign-Oriented Multi-label Detection for Remote Tongue Diagnosis
Authors: Yiliang Chen, Steven SC Ho, Cheng Xu, Yao Jie Xie, Wing-Fai Yeung, Shengfeng He, Jing Qin
Abstract: Tongue diagnosis is a vital tool in Western and Traditional Chinese Medicine, providing key insights into a patient's health by analyzing tongue attributes. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the need for accurate remote medical assessments, emphasizing the importance of precise tongue attribute recognition via telehealth. To address this, we propose a Sign-Oriented multi-label Attributes Detection framework. Our approach begins with an adaptive tongue feature extraction module that standardizes tongue images and mitigates environmental factors. This is followed by a Sign-oriented Network (SignNet) that identifies specific tongue attributes, emulating the diagnostic process of experienced practitioners and enabling comprehensive health evaluations. To validate our methodology, we developed an extensive tongue image dataset specifically designed for telemedicine. Unlike existing datasets, ours is tailored for remote diagnosis, with a comprehensive set of attribute labels. This dataset will be openly available, providing a valuable resource for research. Initial tests have shown improved accuracy in detecting various tongue attributes, highlighting our framework's potential as an essential tool for remote medical assessments.

Title: Rotatable and Movable Antenna-Enabled Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communication
Authors: Yunan Sun
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is regarded as a promising technology for next-generation communication networks. As the demand for communication performance significantly increases, extremely large-scale antenna arrays and tremendously high-frequency bands get widely applied in communication systems, leading to the expansion of the near-field region. On a parallel track, movable antennas (MAs) and six-dimensional MAs (6DMAs) are proposed as emerging technologies to improve the performance of communication and sensing. Based on such a background, this paper investigates the performance of ISAC systems in the near-field region, focusing on a novel system architecture that employs rotatable MAs (RMAs). Additionally, a spherical wave near-field channel model with respect to RMAs' rotations and positions is derived by considering the effective aperture loss. Two designs are explored: a sensing-centric design that minimizes the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) with signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints, and a communication-centric design that maximizes the sum-rate with a CRB constraint. To solve the formulated optimization problems, the paper proposes two alternating optimization (AO) based algorithms composed of the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method. Numerical results demonstrate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and the superiority of the proposed setups for both sensing and communication performance compared to traditional fixed antenna systems, highlighting the potential of RMAs to enhance ISAC systems in near-field scenarios.

Title: Comprehensive Examination of Unrolled Networks for Solving Linear Inverse Problems
Authors: Eric Chen, Xi Chen, Arian Maleki, Shirin Jalali
Abstract: Unrolled networks have become prevalent in various computer vision and imaging tasks. Although they have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in solving specific computer vision and computational imaging tasks, their adaptation to other applications presents considerable challenges. This is primarily due to the multitude of design decisions that practitioners working on new applications must navigate, each potentially affecting the network's overall performance. These decisions include selecting the optimization algorithm, defining the loss function, and determining the number of convolutional layers, among others. Compounding the issue, evaluating each design choice requires time-consuming simulations to train, fine-tune the neural network, and optimize for its performance. As a result, the process of exploring multiple options and identifying the optimal configuration becomes time-consuming and computationally demanding. The main objectives of this paper are (1) to unify some ideas and methodologies used in unrolled networks to reduce the number of design choices a user has to make, and (2) to report a comprehensive ablation study to discuss the impact of each of the choices involved in designing unrolled networks and present practical recommendations based on our findings. We anticipate that this study will help scientists and engineers design unrolled networks for their applications and diagnose problems within their networks efficiently.

Title: A Steerable Deep Network for Model-Free Diffusion MRI Registration
Authors: Gianfranco Cortes, Xiaoda Qu, Baba C. Vemuri
Abstract: Nonrigid registration is vital to medical image analysis but remains challenging for diffusion MRI (dMRI) due to its high-dimensional, orientation-dependent nature. While classical methods are accurate, they are computationally demanding, and deep neural networks, though efficient, have been underexplored for nonrigid dMRI registration compared to structural imaging. We present a novel, deep learning framework for model-free, nonrigid registration of raw diffusion MRI data that does not require explicit reorientation. Unlike previous methods relying on derived representations such as diffusion tensors or fiber orientation distribution functions, in our approach, we formulate the registration as an equivariant diffeomorphism of position-and-orientation space. Central to our method is an $\mathsf{SE}(3)$-equivariant UNet that generates velocity fields while preserving the geometric properties of a raw dMRI's domain. We introduce a new loss function based on the maximum mean discrepancy in Fourier space, implicitly matching ensemble average propagators across images. Experimental results on Human Connectome Project dMRI data demonstrate competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with the added advantage of bypassing the overhead for estimating derived representations. This work establishes a foundation for data-driven, geometry-aware dMRI registration directly in the acquisition space.

Title: Stochastic Quantum Power Flow for Risk Assessment in Power Systems
Authors: Brynjar Sævarsson, Hjörtur Jóhannsson, Spyros Chatzivasileiadis
Abstract: This paper introduces the first quantum computing framework for Stochastic Quantum Power Flow (SQPF) analysis in power systems. The proposed method leverages quantum states to encode power flow distributions, enabling the use of Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling to efficiently assess the probability of line overloads. Our approach significantly reduces the required sample size compared to traditional Monte Carlo methods, making it particularly suited for risk assessments in scenarios involving high uncertainty, such as renewable energy integration. We validate the method on two test systems, demonstrating the computational advantage of quantum algorithms in reducing sample complexity while maintaining accuracy. This work represents a foundational step toward scalable quantum power flow analysis, with potential applications in future power system operations and planning. The results show promising computational speedups, underscoring the potential of quantum computing in addressing the increasing uncertainty in modern power grids.

Title: MacST: Multi-Accent Speech Synthesis via Text Transliteration for Accent Conversion
Authors: Sho Inoue, Shuai Wang, Wanxing Wang, Pengcheng Zhu, Mengxiao Bi, Haizhou Li
Abstract: In accented voice conversion or accent conversion, we seek to convert the accent in speech from one another while preserving speaker identity and semantic content. In this study, we formulate a novel method for creating multi-accented speech samples, thus pairs of accented speech samples by the same speaker, through text transliteration for training accent conversion systems. We begin by generating transliterated text with Large Language Models (LLMs), which is then fed into multilingual TTS models to synthesize accented English speech. As a reference system, we built a sequence-to-sequence model on the synthetic parallel corpus for accent conversion. We validated the proposed method for both native and non-native English speakers. Subjective and objective evaluations further validate our dataset's effectiveness in accent conversion studies.

Title: Takin-VC: Expressive Zero-Shot Voice Conversion via Adaptive Hybrid Content Encoding and Enhanced Timbre Modeling
Authors: Yuguang Yang, Yu Pan, Jixun Yao, Xiang Zhang, Jianhao Ye, Hongbin Zhou, Lei Xie, Lei Ma, Jianjun Zhao
Abstract: Expressive zero-shot voice conversion (VC) is a critical and challenging task that aims to transform the source timbre into an arbitrary unseen speaker while preserving the original content and expressive qualities. Despite recent progress in zero-shot VC, there remains considerable potential for improvements in speaker similarity and speech naturalness. Moreover, existing zero-shot VC systems struggle to fully reproduce paralinguistic information in highly expressive speech, such as breathing, crying, and emotional nuances, limiting their practical applicability. To address these issues, we propose Takin-VC, a novel expressive zero-shot VC framework via adaptive hybrid content encoding and memory-augmented context-aware timbre modeling. Specifically, we introduce an innovative hybrid content encoder that incorporates an adaptive fusion module, capable of effectively integrating quantized features of the pre-trained WavLM and HybridFormer in an implicit manner, so as to extract precise linguistic features while enriching paralinguistic elements. For timbre modeling, we propose advanced memory-augmented and context-aware modules to generate high-quality target timbre features and fused representations that seamlessly align source content with target timbre. To enhance real-time performance, we advocate a conditional flow matching model to reconstruct the Mel-spectrogram of the source speech. Experimental results show that our Takin-VC consistently surpasses state-of-the-art VC systems, achieving notable improvements in terms of speech naturalness, speech expressiveness, and speaker similarity, while offering enhanced inference speed.

Title: Communication Constellation Design of Minimum Number of Satellites with Continuous Coverage and Inter-Satellite Link
Authors: Soobin Jeon, Sang-Young Park
Abstract: The recent advancement in research on distributed space systems that operate a large number of satellites as a single system urges the need for the investigation of satellite constellations. Communication constellations can be used to construct global or regional communication networks using inter-satellite and ground-to-satellite links. This study examines two challenges of communication constellations: continuous coverage and inter-satellite link connectivity. The bounded Voronoi diagram and APC decomposition are presented as continuous coverage analysis methods. For continuity analysis of the inter-satellite link, the relative motion between adjacent orbital planes is used to derive analytic solutions. The Walker-Delta constellation and common ground-track constellation design methods are introduced as examples to verify the analysis methods. The common ground-track constellations are classified into quasi-symmetric and optimal constellations. The optimal common ground-track constellation is optimized using the BILP algorithm. The simulation results compare the performance of the communication constellations according to various design methods.

Title: Integration of Cobalt Ferromagnetic Control Gates for Electrical and Magnetic Manipulation of Semiconductor Quantum Dots
Authors: Fabio Bersano, Michele Aldeghi, Niccolò Martinolli, Victor Boureau, Thibault Aboud, Michele Ghini, Pasquale Scarlino, Gian Salis, Adrian Mihai Ionescu
Abstract: The rise of electron spin qubit architectures for quantum computing processors has led to a strong interest in designing and integrating ferromagnets to induce stray magnetic fields for electron dipole spin resonance (EDSR). The integration of nanomagnets imposes however strict layout and processing constraints, challenging the arrangement of different gating layers and the control of neighboring qubit frequencies. This work reports a successful integration of nano-sized cobalt control gates into a multi-gate FD-SOI nanowire with nanometer-scale dot-to-magnet pitch, simultaneously exploiting electrical and ferromagnetic properties of the gate stack at nanoscale. The electrical characterization of the multi-gate nanowire exhibits full field effect functionality of all ferromagnetic gates from room temperature to 10 mK, proving quantum dot formation when ferromagnets are operated as barrier gates. The front-end-of-line (FEOL) compatible integration of cobalt is examined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and high/low frequency capacitance characterization, confirming the quality of interfaces and control over material diffusion. Insights into the magnetic properties of thin films and patterned control-gates are provided by vibrating sample magnetometry and electron holography measurements. Micromagnetic simulations anticipate that this structure fulfills the requirements for EDSR driving for magnetic fields higher than 1 T, where a homogeneous magnetization along the hard magnetic axis of the Co gates is expected. The FDSOI architecture showcased in this study provides a scalable alternative to micromagnets deposited in the back-end-of-line (BEOL) and middle-of-line (MOL) processes, while bringing technological insights for the FEOL-compatible integration of Co nanostructures in spin qubit devices.

Title: Stability and Synchronization of Kuramoto Oscillators
Authors: Abhiram Gorle
Abstract: Imagine a group of oscillators, each endowed with their own rhythm or frequency, be it the ticking of a biological clock, the swing of a pendulum, or the glowing of fireflies. While these individual oscillators may seem independent of one another at first glance, the true magic lies in their ability to influence and synchronize with one another, like a group of fireflies glowing in unison. The Kuramoto model was motivated by this phenomenon of collective synchronization, when a group of a large number of oscillators spontaneously lock to a common frequency, despite vast differences in their individual frequencies. Inspired by Kuramoto's groundbreaking work in the 1970s, this model captures the essence of how interconnected systems, ranging from biological networks to power grids, can achieve a state of synchronization. This work aims to study the stability and synchronization of Kuramoto oscillators, starting off with an introduction to Kuramoto Oscillators and it's broader applications. We then at a graph theoretic formulation for the same and establish various criterion for the stability, synchronization of Kuramoto Oscillators. Finally, we broadly analyze and experiment with various physical systems that tend to behave like Kuramoto oscillators followed by further simulations.

Title: Enhancing Sample Generation of Diffusion Models using Noise Level Correction
Authors: Abulikemu Abuduweili, Chenyang Yuan, Changliu Liu, Frank Permenter
Abstract: The denoising process of diffusion models can be interpreted as an approximate projection of noisy samples onto the data manifold. Moreover, the noise level in these samples approximates their distance to the underlying manifold. Building on this insight, we propose a novel method to enhance sample generation by aligning the estimated noise level with the true distance of noisy samples to the manifold. Specifically, we introduce a noise level correction network, leveraging a pre-trained denoising network, to refine noise level estimates during the denoising process. Additionally, we extend this approach to various image restoration tasks by integrating task-specific constraints, including inpainting, deblurring, super-resolution, colorization, and compressed sensing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves sample quality in both unconstrained and constrained generation scenarios. Notably, the proposed noise level correction framework is compatible with existing denoising schedulers (e.g., DDIM), offering additional performance improvements.

Title: Hierarchical Control of Emotion Rendering in Speech Synthesis
Authors: Sho Inoue, Kun Zhou, Shuai Wang, Haizhou Li
Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) aims to generate realistic emotional speech from input text. However, quantitatively controlling multi-level emotion rendering remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based emotional TTS framework with a novel approach for emotion intensity modeling to facilitate fine-grained control over emotion rendering at the phoneme, word, and utterance levels. We introduce a hierarchical emotion distribution (ED) extractor that captures a quantifiable ED embedding across different speech segment levels. Additionally, we explore various acoustic features and assess their impact on emotion intensity modeling. During TTS training, the hierarchical ED embedding effectively captures the variance in emotion intensity from the reference audio and correlates it with linguistic and speaker information. The TTS model not only generates emotional speech during inference, but also quantitatively controls the emotion rendering over the speech constituents. Both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in terms of speech quality, emotional expressiveness, and hierarchical emotion control.

Title: ResPanDiff: Diffusion Model for Pansharpening by Inferring Residual Inference
Authors: Shiqi Cao, Liangjian Deng, Shangqi Deng
Abstract: The implementation of diffusion-based pansharpening task is predominantly constrained by its slow inference speed, which results from numerous sampling steps. Despite the existing techniques aiming to accelerate sampling, they often compromise performance when fusing multi-source images. To ease this limitation, we introduce a novel and efficient diffusion model named Diffusion Model for Pansharpening by Inferring Residual Inference (ResPanDiff), which significantly reduces the number of diffusion steps without sacrificing the performance to tackle pansharpening task. In ResPanDiff, we innovatively propose a Markov chain that transits from noisy residuals to the residuals between the LRMS and HRMS images, thereby reducing the number of sampling steps and enhancing performance. Additionally, we design the latent space to help model extract more features at the encoding stage, Shallow Cond-Injection~(SC-I) to help model fetch cond-injected hidden features with higher dimensions, and loss functions to give a better guidance for the residual generation task. enabling the model to achieve superior performance in residual generation. Furthermore, experimental evaluations on pansharpening datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior outcomes compared to recent state-of-the-art~(SOTA) techniques, requiring only 15 sampling steps, which reduces over $90\%$ step compared with the benchmark diffusion models. Our experiments also include thorough discussions and ablation studies to underscore the effectiveness of our approach.
