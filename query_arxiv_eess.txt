Title: Pinching-Antenna Assisted Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer
Authors: Yixuan Li, Ji Wang, Yuanwei Liu, Zhiguo Ding
Abstract: This letter introduces a novel pinching-antenna-system (PASS) assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), where multiple pinching antennas (PAs) are strategically activiated on a waveguide to facilitate information transmission to multiple information receivers (IRs) and power transfer to multiple energy receivers (ERs) simultaneously. Leveraging the single-waveguide architecture, non-orthogonal multiple access is employed to enable the superposed transmission of information signals, eliminating the need for dedicated energy carriers by concurrently serving both the IRs and the ERs. In this letter, an optimization problem is first formulated with an objective is to maximize the sum power received at the ERs via joint optimizing the IRs power allocation and the PAs positioning. Given the challenging non-convex nature of the formulated optimization problem, it is decoupled into two sub-problems which are solved alternatively. Specifically, the power allocation subproblem is recast a convex optimization problem, and hence can be solved efficiently. Furthermore, we propose a high-precision element-wise algorithm and a low-complexity linearly decreasing weight particle swarm optimization algorithm to solve the position optimization sub-problem. The numerical results demonstrate that PAs assisted SWIPT can achieve a remarkable performance gain compared to conventional system.

Title: Low-Complexity CNN-Based Classification of Electroneurographic Signals
Authors: Arek Berc Gokdag, Silvia Mura, Antonio Coviello, Michele Zhu, Maurizio Magarini, Umberto Spagnolini
Abstract: Peripheral nerve interfaces (PNIs) facilitate neural recording and stimulation for treating nerve injuries, but real-time classification of electroneurographic (ENG) signals remains challenging due to constraints on complexity and latency, particularly in implantable devices. This study introduces MobilESCAPE-Net, a lightweight architecture that reduces computational cost while maintaining and slightly improving classification performance. Compared to the state-of-the-art ESCAPE-Net, MobilESCAPE-Net achieves comparable accuracy and F1-score with significantly lower complexity, reducing trainable parameters by 99.9\% and floating point operations per second by 92.47\%, enabling faster inference and real-time processing. Its efficiency makes it well-suited for low-complexity ENG signal classification in resource-constrained environments such as implantable devices.

Authors: Guangyu Lei, Yanduo Qiao, Tianhao Liang, Weijie Yuan, Tingting Zhang
Abstract: Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation exploits the sparsity of Delay-Doppler domain channels, making it highly effective in high-mobility scenarios. Its accurate channel estimation supports integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. The letter introduces a low-complexity technique for estimating delay and Doppler shifts under fractional effects, while addressing inter-path interference. The method employs a sequential estimation process combined with interference elimination based on energy leakage, ensuring accurate channel estimation. Furthermore, the estimated channel parameters can signifcantly improve ISAC system performance by enhancing sensing capabilities. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of this approach in achieving accurate channel estimation and facilitating sensing tasks for ISAC systems.

Title: DeltaDPD: Exploiting Dynamic Temporal Sparsity in Recurrent Neural Networks for Energy-Efficient Wideband Digital Predistortion
Authors: Yizhuo Wu, Yi Zhu, Kun Qian, Qinyu Chen, Anding Zhu, John Gajadharsing, Leo C. N. de Vreede, Chang Gao
Abstract: Digital Predistortion (DPD) is a popular technique to enhance signal quality in wideband RF power amplifiers (PAs). With increasing bandwidth and data rates, DPD faces significant energy consumption challenges during deployment, contrasting with its efficiency goals. State-of-the-art DPD models rely on recurrent neural networks (RNN), whose computational complexity hinders system efficiency. This paper introduces DeltaDPD, exploring the dynamic temporal sparsity of input signals and neuronal hidden states in RNNs for energy-efficient DPD, reducing arithmetic operations and memory accesses while preserving satisfactory linearization performance. Applying a TM3.1a 200MHz-BW 256-QAM OFDM signal to a 3.5 GHz GaN Doherty RF PA, DeltaDPD achieves -50.03 dBc in Adjacent Channel Power Ratio (ACPR), -37.22 dB in Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) and -38.52 dBc in Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) with 52% temporal sparsity, leading to a 1.8X reduction in estimated inference power. The DeltaDPD code will be released after formal publication at this https URL.

Title: SpectrumFM: A Foundation Model for Intelligent Spectrum Management
Authors: Fuhui Zhou, Chunyu Liu, Hao Zhang, Wei Wu, Qihui Wu, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng, Tony Q. S. Quek, Chan-Byoung Chae
Abstract: Intelligent spectrum management is crucial for improving spectrum efficiency and achieving secure utilization of spectrum resources. However, existing intelligent spectrum management methods, typically based on small-scale models, suffer from notable limitations in recognition accuracy, convergence speed, and generalization, particularly in the complex and dynamic spectrum environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel spectrum foundation model, termed SpectrumFM, establishing a new paradigm for spectrum management. SpectrumFM features an innovative encoder architecture that synergistically exploits the convolutional neural networks and the multi-head self-attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction and enable robust representation learning. The model is pre-trained via two novel self-supervised learning tasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, which leverage large-scale in-phase and quadrature (IQ) data to achieve comprehensive and transferable spectrum representations. Furthermore, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy is proposed to enable SpectrumFM to adapt to various downstream spectrum management tasks, including automatic modulation classification (AMC), wireless technology classification (WTC), spectrum sensing (SS), and anomaly detection (AD). Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpectrumFM achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy, robustness, adaptability, few-shot learning efficiency, and convergence speed, consistently outperforming conventional methods across multiple benchmarks. Specifically, SpectrumFM improves AMC accuracy by up to 12.1% and WTC accuracy by 9.3%, achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97 in SS at -4 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and enhances AD performance by over 10%.

Title: From Biometrics to Environmental Control: AI-Enhanced Digital Twins for Personalized Health Interventions in Healing Landscapes
Authors: Yiping Meng, Yiming Sun
Abstract: The dynamic nature of human health and comfort calls for adaptive systems that respond to individual physiological needs in real time. This paper presents an AI-enhanced digital twin framework that integrates biometric signals, specifically electrocardiogram (ECG) data, with environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and ventilation. Leveraging IoT-enabled sensors and biometric monitoring devices, the system continuously acquires, synchronises, and preprocesses multimodal data streams to construct a responsive virtual replica of the physical environment. To validate this framework, a detailed case study is conducted using the MIT-BIH noise stress test dataset. ECG signals are filtered and segmented using dynamic sliding windows, followed by extracting heart rate variability (HRV) features such as SDNN, BPM, QTc, and LF/HF ratio. Relative deviation metrics are computed against clean baselines to quantify stress responses. A random forest classifier is trained to predict stress levels across five categories, and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is used to interpret model behaviour and identify key contributing features. These predictions are mapped to a structured set of environmental interventions using a Five Level Stress Intervention Mapping, which activates multi-scale responses across personal, room, building, and landscape levels. This integration of physiological insight, explainable AI, and adaptive control establishes a new paradigm for health-responsive built environments. It lays the foundation for the future development of intelligent, personalised healing spaces.

Title: Terahertz Spatial Wireless Channel Modeling with Radio Radiance Field
Authors: John Song, Lihao Zhang, Feng Ye, Haijian Sun
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communication is a key enabler for 6G systems, offering ultra-wide bandwidth and unprecedented data rates. However, THz signal propagation differs significantly from lower-frequency bands due to severe free space path loss, minimal diffraction and specular reflection, and prominent scattering, making conventional channel modeling and pilot-based estimation approaches inefficient. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of applying radio radiance field (RRF) framework to the THz band. This method reconstructs a continuous RRF using visual-based geometry and sparse THz RF measurements, enabling efficient spatial channel state information (Spatial-CSI) modeling without dense sampling. We first build a fine simulated THz scenario, then we reconstruct the RRF and evaluate the performance in terms of both reconstruction quality and effectiveness in THz communication, showing that the reconstructed RRF captures key propagation paths with sparse training samples. Our findings demonstrate that RRF modeling remains effective in the THz regime and provides a promising direction for scalable, low-cost spatial channel reconstruction in future 6G networks.

Title: FEMSN: Frequency-Enhanced Multiscale Network for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery under strong noise environments
Authors: Yuhan Yuan, Xiaomo Jiang, Yanfeng Han, Ke Xiao
Abstract: Rolling bearings are critical components of rotating machinery, and their proper functioning is essential for industrial production. Most existing condition monitoring methods focus on extracting discriminative features from time-domain signals to assess bearing health status. However, under complex operating conditions, periodic impulsive characteristics related to fault information are often obscured by noise interference. Consequently, existing approaches struggle to learn distinctive fault-related features in such scenarios. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel CNN-based model named FEMSN. Specifically, a Fourier Adaptive Denoising Encoder Layer (FADEL) is introduced as an input denoising layer to enhance key features while filtering out irrelevant information. Subsequently, a Multiscale Time-Frequency Fusion (MSTFF) module is employed to extract fused time-frequency features, further improving the model robustness and nonlinear representation capability. Additionally, a distillation layer is incorporated to expand the receptive field. Based on these advancements, a novel deep lightweight CNN model, termed the Frequency-Enhanced Multiscale Network (FEMSN), is developed. The effectiveness of FEMSN and FADEL in machine health monitoring and stability assessment is validated through two case studies.

Title: ALFEE: Adaptive Large Foundation Model for EEG Representation
Authors: Wei Xiong, Junming Lin, Jiangtong Li, Jie Li, Changjun Jiang
Abstract: While foundation models excel in text, image, and video domains, the critical biological signals, particularly electroencephalography(EEG), remain underexplored. EEG benefits neurological research with its high temporal resolution, operational practicality, and safety profile. However, low signal-to-noise ratio, inter-subject variability, and cross-paradigm differences hinder the generalization of current models. Existing methods often employ simplified strategies, such as a single loss function or a channel-temporal joint representation module, and suffer from a domain gap between pretraining and evaluation tasks that compromises efficiency and adaptability. To address these limitations, we propose the Adaptive Large Foundation model for EEG signal representation(ALFEE) framework, a novel hybrid transformer architecture with two learning stages for robust EEG representation learning. ALFEE employs a hybrid attention that separates channel-wise feature aggregation from temporal dynamics modeling, enabling robust EEG representation with variable channel configurations. A channel encoder adaptively compresses variable channel information, a temporal encoder captures task-guided evolution, and a hybrid decoder reconstructs signals in both temporal and frequency domains. During pretraining, ALFEE optimizes task prediction, channel and temporal mask reconstruction, and temporal forecasting to enhance multi-scale and multi-channel representation. During fine-tuning, a full-model adaptation with a task-specific token dictionary and a cross-attention layer boosts performance across multiple tasks. After 25,000 hours of pretraining, extensive experimental results on six downstream EEG tasks demonstrate the superior performance of ALFEE over existing models. Our ALFEE framework establishes a scalable foundation for biological signal analysis with implementation at this https URL.

Title: Q-Heart: ECG Question Answering via Knowledge-Informed Multimodal LLMs
Authors: Hung Manh Pham, Jialu Tang, Aaqib Saeed, Dong Ma
Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) offers critical cardiovascular insights, such as identifying arrhythmias and myocardial ischemia, but enabling automated systems to answer complex clinical questions directly from ECG signals (ECG-QA) remains a significant challenge. Current approaches often lack robust multimodal reasoning capabilities or rely on generic architectures ill-suited for the nuances of physiological signals. We introduce Q-Heart, a novel multimodal framework designed to bridge this gap. Q-Heart leverages a powerful, adapted ECG encoder and integrates its representations with textual information via a specialized ECG-aware transformer-based mapping layer. Furthermore, Q-Heart leverages dynamic prompting and retrieval of relevant historical clinical reports to guide tuning the language model toward knowledge-aware ECG reasoning. Extensive evaluations on the benchmark ECG-QA dataset show Q-Heart achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by a 4% improvement in exact match accuracy. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining domain-specific architectural adaptations with knowledge-augmented LLM instruction tuning for complex physiological ECG analysis, paving the way for more capable and potentially interpretable clinical patient care systems.

Title: Focusing Metasurfaces of (Un)equal Power Allocations for Wireless Power Transfer
Authors: Andi Ding, Yee Hui Lee, Eng Leong Tan, Yufei Zhao, Yanqiu Jia, Yong Liang Guan, Theng Huat Gan, Cedric W. L. Lee
Abstract: Focusing metasurfaces (MTSs) tailored for different power allocations in wireless power transfer (WPT) system are proposed in this letter. The designed metasurface unit cells ensure that the phase shift can cover over a 2{\pi} span with high transmittance. Based on near-field focusing theory, an adapted formula is employed to guide the phase distribution for compensating incident waves. Three MTSs, each with dimensions of 190*190 mm and comprising 19*19 unit cells, are constructed to achieve dual-polarized two foci with 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1 power allocations, yielding maximum focusing efficiencies of 71.6%, 65.2%, and 57.5%, respectively. The first two MTSs are fabricated and tested, demonstrating minimal -3 dB depth of focus (DOF). Results are aligned with theoretical predictions. These designs aim to facilitate power transfer to different systems based on their specific requirements in an internet of things (IoT) environment.

Title: Interval reduced-order switched positive observers for uncertain switched positive linear systems
Authors: Naohisa Otsuka, Daiki Kakehi, Przemysław Ignaciuk
Abstract: In this paper, existence conditions and a design procedure of reduced-order switched positive observers for continuous- and discrete-time switched positive linear systems with uncertainty are established. In the analyzed class, arbitrary switching is permitted, whereas the uncertainty expressed via matrix inequalities concerns both the initial state and system parameters. Positive lower and positive upper interval switched observers are obtained. The proposed observers are of (n - p) order, where n is the dimension of the state vector and p is the rank of the output matrix, i.e., p-dimensional measurement information. Moreover, as a special case, existence conditions and a design procedure of reduced-order positive observers for uncertain positive linear systems without switching are provided. The theoretical findings are illustrated by two numerical examples for continuous- and discrete-time systems.

Title: Reconstructing Brain Causal Dynamics for Subject and Task Fingerprints using fMRI Time-series Data
Authors: Dachuan Song, Li Shen, Duy Duong-Tran, Xuan Wang
Abstract: Purpose: Recently, there has been a revived interest in system neuroscience causation models, driven by their unique capability to unravel complex relationships in multi-scale brain networks. In this paper, we present a novel method that leverages causal dynamics to achieve effective fMRI-based subject and task fingerprinting. Methods: By applying an implicit-explicit discretization scheme, we develop a two-timescale linear state-space model. Through data-driven identification of its parameters, the model captures causal signatures, including directed interactions among brain regions from a spatial perspective, and disentangled fast and slow dynamic modes of brain activity from a temporal perspective. These causal signatures are then integrated with: (i) a modal decomposition and projection method for model-based subject identification, and (ii) a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for learning-based task classification. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of the brain reachability landscape as a novel visualization tool, which quantitatively characterizes the maximum possible activation levels of brain regions under various fMRI tasks. Results: We evaluate the proposed approach using the Human Connectome Project dataset and demonstrate its advantage over non-causality-based methods. The obtained causal signatures are visualized and demonstrate clear biological relevance with established understandings of brain function. Conclusion: We verified the feasibility and effectiveness of utilizing brain causal signatures for subject and task fingerprinting. Additionally, our work paves the way for further studies on causal fingerprints with potential applications in both healthy controls and neurodegenerative diseases.

Title: Direct Data Driven Control Using Noisy Measurements
Authors: Ramin Esmzad, Gokul S. Sankar, Teawon Han, Hamidreza Modares
Abstract: This paper presents a novel direct data-driven control framework for solving the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) under disturbances and noisy state measurements. The system dynamics are assumed unknown, and the LQR solution is learned using only a single trajectory of noisy input-output data while bypassing system identification. Our approach guarantees mean-square stability (MSS) and optimal performance by leveraging convex optimization techniques that incorporate noise statistics directly into the controller synthesis. First, we establish a theoretical result showing that the MSS of an uncertain data-driven system implies the MSS of the true closed-loop system. Building on this, we develop a robust stability condition using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) that yields a stabilizing controller gain from noisy measurements. Finally, we formulate a data-driven LQR problem as a semidefinite program (SDP) that computes an optimal gain, minimizing the steady-state covariance. Extensive simulations on benchmark systems -- including a rotary inverted pendulum and an active suspension system -- demonstrate the superior robustness and accuracy of our method compared to existing data-driven LQR approaches. The proposed framework offers a practical and theoretically grounded solution for controller design in noise-corrupted environments where system identification is infeasible.

Title: An Improved Approach to Estimate the Internal Resistance of a Battery
Authors: Prarthana Pillai, Smeet Desai, Krishna R. Pattipati, Balakumar Balasingam
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of resistance estimation in electronic systems including battery management systems (BMS) and battery chargers. In typical applications, the battery resistance is obtained through an approximate method computed as the ratio of the voltage difference to the applied current excitation pulse or vice versa for admittance. When estimating the battery resistance, this approach ignores the change in the open circuit voltage (OCV) as a result of the excitation signal. In this paper, we formally demonstrate and quantify the effect of the OCV drop on the errors in internal resistance estimation. Then, we propose a novel method to accurately estimate the internal resistance by accounting for the change in OCV caused by the applied current excitation signal. The proposed approach is based on a novel observation model that allows one to estimate the effect of OCV without requiring any additional information, such as the state of charge (SOC), parameters of the OCV-SOC curve, and the battery capacity. As such, the proposed approach is independent of the battery chemistry, size, age, and the ambient temperature. A performance analysis of the proposed approach using the battery simulator shows significant performance gain in the range of 30% to more than 250% in percentage estimation error. Then, the proposed approach is applied for resistance estimation during the hybrid pulse power characterization (HPPC) of cylindrical Li-ion battery cells. Results from tested batteries show that the proposed approach reduced the overestimated internal resistance of the batteries by up to 20 m{\Omega}.

Title: Development of Reduced Feeder and Load Models Using Practical Topological and Loading Data
Authors: Sameer Nekkalapu, Sushrut Thakar, Antos Cheeramban Varghese, Vijay Vittal, Bo Gong, Ken Brown
Abstract: Distribution feeder and load model reduction methods are essential for maintaining a good tradeoff between accurate representation of grid behavior and reduced computational complexity in power system studies. An effective algorithm to obtain a reduced order representation of the practical feeders using utility topological and loading data has been presented in this paper. Simulations conducted in this work show that the reduced feeder and load model of a utility feeder, obtained using the proposed method, can accurately capture contactor and motor stalling behaviors for critical events such as fault induced delayed voltage recovery.

Title: Handling Pedestrian Uncertainty in Coordinating Autonomous Vehicles at Signal-Free Intersections
Authors: Filippos N. Tzortzoglou, Andreas A. Malikopoulos
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework for the coordination of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) at signal-free intersections, accounting for the unexpected presence of pedestrians. First, we introduce a general vehicle-to-infrastructure communication protocol and a low-level controller that determines the optimal unconstrained trajectories for CAVs, in terms of fuel efficiency and travel time, to cross the intersection without considering pedestrians. If such an unconstrained trajectory is unattainable, we introduce sufficient certificates for each CAV to cross the intersection while respecting the associated constraints. Next, we consider the case where an unexpected pedestrian enters the road. When the CAV's sensors detect a pedestrian, an emergency mode is activated, which imposes certificates related to an unsafe set in the pedestrian's proximity area. Simultaneously, a re-planning mechanism is implemented for all CAVs to accommodate the trajectories of vehicles operating in emergency mode. Finally, we validate the efficacy of our approach through simulations conducted in MATLAB and RoadRunner softwares, which facilitate the integration of sensor tools and the realization of real-time implementation.

Title: Joint Parameterization of Hybrid Physics-Based and Machine Learning Li-Ion Battery Model
Authors: Jackson Fogelquist, Xinfan Lin
Abstract: Electrochemical hybrid battery models have major potential to enable advanced physics-based control, diagnostic, and prognostic features for next-generation lithium-ion battery management systems. This is due to the physical significance of the electrochemical model, which is complemented by a machine learning model that compensates for output prediction errors caused by system uncertainties. While hybrid models have demonstrated robust output prediction performance under large system uncertainties, they are highly susceptible to the influence of uncertainties during parameter identification, which can compromise the physical significance of the model. To address this challenge, we present a parameter estimation framework that explicitly considers system uncertainties through a discrepancy function. The approach also incorporates a downsampling procedure to address the computational barriers associated with large time-series data sets, as are typical in the battery domain. The framework was validated in simulation, yielding several mean parameter estimation errors that were one order of magnitude smaller than those of the conventional least squares approach. While developed for the high-uncertainty, electrochemical hybrid modeling context, the estimation framework is applicable to all models and is presented in a generalized form.

Title: Monopulse Parameter Estimation based on MIMO-STCA Radar in the Presence of Multiple Mainlobe Jammings
Authors: Huake Wang, Dongchang Zhang, Guisheng Liao, Yinghui Quan
Abstract: The monopulse technique is characterized by its high accuracy in angle estimation and simplicity in engineering implementation. However, in the complex electromagnetic environment, the presence of the mainlobe jamming (MLJ) greatly degrades the accuracy of angle estimation. Conventional methods of jamming suppression often lead to significant deviations in monopulse ratio while suppressing MLJ. Additionally, the monopulse technique based on traditional radar cannot jointly estimate the target's range. In this paper, the four-channel adaptive beamforming (ABF) algorithm is proposed, which adds a delta-delta channel based on conventional sum-difference-difference three-channel to suppress a single MLJ. Moreover, considering the suppression of multiple MLJs and sidelobe jammings (SLJs), the row-column ABF algorithm is proposed. This algorithm utilizes more spatial degrees of freedom (DOFs) to suppress multiple jammings by the row-column adaptive beamforming at the subarray level. The key ideal of both algorithms is to suppress MLJ with null along one spatial direction while keeping the sum and difference beampatterns undistorted along another spatial direction. Therefore, the monopulse ratio remains undistorted while suppressing the MLJ, ensuring the accuracy of monopulse parameter estimation. Furthermore, by utilizing the additional degrees of freedom (DOFs) in the range domain provided by the multiple-input multiple-output space-time coding array (MIMO-STCA) radar, joint angle-range estimation can be achieved through the monopulse technique. Simulation results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed methods in suppressing multiple MLJs and enhancing the accuracy of monopulse parameter estimation, as verified by the low root mean square error (RMSE) in the parameter estimation results.

Title: PC-SRGAN: Physically Consistent Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network for General Transient Simulations
Authors: Md Rakibul Hasan, Pouria Behnoudfar, Dan MacKinlay, Thomas Poulet
Abstract: Machine Learning, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), has revolutionised Super Resolution (SR). However, generated images often lack physical meaningfulness, which is essential for scientific applications. Our approach, PC-SRGAN, enhances image resolution while ensuring physical consistency for interpretable simulations. PC-SRGAN significantly improves both the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio and the Structural Similarity Index Measure compared to conventional methods, even with limited training data (e.g., only 13% of training data required for SRGAN). Beyond SR, PC-SRGAN augments physically meaningful machine learning, incorporating numerically justified time integrators and advanced quality metrics. These advancements promise reliable and causal machine-learning models in scientific domains. A significant advantage of PC-SRGAN over conventional SR techniques is its physical consistency, which makes it a viable surrogate model for time-dependent problems. PC-SRGAN advances scientific machine learning, offering improved accuracy and efficiency for image processing, enhanced process understanding, and broader applications to scientific research. The source codes and data will be made publicly available at this https URL upon acceptance of this paper.

Title: Event-based Neural Spike Detection Using Spiking Neural Networks for Neuromorphic iBMI Systems
Authors: Chanwook Hwang, Biyan Zhou, Ye Ke, Vivek Mohan, Jong Hwan Ko, Arindam Basu
Abstract: Implantable brain-machine interfaces (iBMIs) are evolving to record from thousands of neurons wirelessly but face challenges in data bandwidth, power consumption, and implant size. We propose a novel Spiking Neural Network Spike Detector (SNN-SPD) that processes event-based neural data generated via delta modulation and pulse count modulation, converting signals into sparse events. By leveraging the temporal dynamics and inherent sparsity of spiking neural networks, our method improves spike detection performance while maintaining low computational overhead suitable for implantable devices. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SNN-SPD achieves an accuracy of 95.72% at high noise levels (standard deviation 0.2), which is about 2% higher than the existing Artificial Neural Network Spike Detector (ANN-SPD). Moreover, SNN-SPD requires only 0.41% of the computation and about 26.62% of the weight parameters compared to ANN-SPD, with zero multiplications. This approach balances efficiency and performance, enabling effective data compression and power savings for next-generation iBMIs.

Authors: Daniel Strick, Carlos Garcia, Anthony Huang
Abstract: Deep learning for radiologic image analysis is a rapidly growing field in biomedical research and is likely to become a standard practice in modern medicine. On the publicly available NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset, containing X-ray images that are classified by the presence or absence of 14 different diseases, we reproduced an algorithm known as CheXNet, as well as explored other algorithms that outperform CheXNet's baseline metrics. Model performance was primarily evaluated using the F1 score and AUC-ROC, both of which are critical metrics for imbalanced, multi-label classification tasks in medical imaging. The best model achieved an average AUC-ROC score of 0.85 and an average F1 score of 0.39 across all 14 disease classifications present in the dataset.

Authors: Zhenhua Zhou, Bozhen Jiang, Qin Wang
Abstract: The rapid rise in electric vehicle (EV) adoption demands precise charging station load forecasting, challenged by long-sequence temporal dependencies and limited data in new facilities. This study proposes MIK-TST, a novel two-stage transfer learning framework integrating Mixer, Informer, and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN). The Mixer fuses multi-source features, Informer captures long-range dependencies via ProbSparse attention, and KAN enhances nonlinear modeling with learnable activation functions. Pre-trained on extensive data and fine-tuned on limited target data, MIK-TST achieves 4% and 8% reductions in MAE and MSE, respectively, outperforming baselines on a dataset of 26 charging stations in Boulder, USA. This scalable solution enhances smart grid efficiency and supports sustainable EV infrastructure expansion.

Title: A Novel Inverter Control Strategy with Power Decoupling for Microgrid Operations in Grid-Connected and Islanded Modes
Authors: Yan Tong, Qin Wang, Aihong Tang
Abstract: Grid-forming, particularly those utilizing droop control and virtual synchronous generators (VSG), can actively regulate the frequency and voltage of microgrid systems, exhibiting dynamic characteristics akin to those of synchronous generators. Although droop control and VSG control each have distinct benefits, neither can fully meet the diverse, dynamic needs of both grid-connected (GC) and islanded (IS) modes. Additionally, the coupling between active and reactive power can negatively impact microgrids' dynamic performance and stability. To solve these problems, this paper introduces a unified dynamic power coupling (UDC) model. This model's active power control loop can be tailored to meet diverse requirements. By implementing a well-designed control loop, the system can harness the advantages of both droop control and VSG control. In islanded mode, the proposed model can provide virtual inertia and damping properties, while in grid-connected mode, the inverter's active power output can follow the changed references without significant overshoot or oscillation. Furthermore, the model incorporates coupling compensation and virtual impedance based on a relative gain array in the frequency domain to facilitate quantitative analysis of power coupling characteristics. This paper outlines a distinct design process for the unified model. Finally, the proposed control method has been validated through simulation.

Title: RADE: A Neural Codec for Transmitting Speech over HF Radio Channels
Authors: David Rowe, Jean-Marc Valin
Abstract: Speech compression is commonly used to send voice over radio channels in applications such as mobile telephony and two-way push-to-talk (PTT) radio. In classical systems, the speech codec is combined with forward error correction, modulation and radio hardware. In this paper we describe an autoencoder that replaces many of the traditional signal processing elements with a neural network. The encoder takes a vocoder feature set (short term spectrum, pitch, voicing), and produces discrete time, but continuously valued quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) symbols. We use orthogonal frequency domain multiplexing (OFDM) to send and receive these symbols over high frequency (HF) radio channels. The decoder converts received QAM symbols to vocoder features suitable for synthesis. The autoencoder has been trained to be robust to additive Gaussian noise and multipath channel impairments while simultaneously maintaining a Peak To Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of less than 1~dB. Over simulated and real world HF radio channels we have achieved output speech intelligibility that clearly surpasses existing analog and digital radio systems over a range of SNRs.

Title: A Short Overview of Multi-Modal Wi-Fi Sensing
Authors: Zijian Zhao
Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing has emerged as a significant technology in wireless sensing and Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC), offering benefits such as low cost, high penetration, and enhanced privacy. Currently, it is widely utilized in various applications, including action recognition, human localization, and crowd counting. However, Wi-Fi sensing also faces challenges, such as low robustness and difficulties in data collection. Recently, there has been an increasing focus on multi-modal Wi-Fi sensing, where other modalities can act as teachers, providing ground truth or robust features for Wi-Fi sensing models to learn from, or can be directly fused with Wi-Fi for enhanced sensing capabilities. Although these methods have demonstrated promising results and substantial value in practical applications, there is a lack of comprehensive surveys reviewing them. To address this gap, this paper reviews the multi-modal Wi-Fi sensing literature \textbf{from the past 24 months} and highlights the current limitations, challenges and future directions in this field.

Title: AI-CDA4All: Democratizing Cooperative Autonomous Driving for All Drivers via Affordable Dash-cam Hardware and Open-source AI Software
Authors: Shengming Yuan, Hao Zhou
Abstract: As transportation technology advances, the demand for connected vehicle infrastructure has greatly increased to improve their efficiency and safety. One area of advancement, Cooperative Driving Automation (CDA) still relies on expensive autonomy sensors or connectivity units and are not interoperable across existing market car makes/models, limiting its scalability on public roads. To fill these gaps, this paper presents a novel approach to democratizing CDA technology, it leverages low-cost, commercially available edge devices such as vehicle dash-cams and open-source software to make the technology accessible and scalable to be used in transportation infrastructure and broader public domains. This study also investigates the feasibility of utilizing cost-effective communication protocols based on LTE and WiFi. These technologies enable lightweight Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications, facilitating real-time data exchange between vehicles and infrastructure. Our research and development efforts are aligned with industrial standards to ensure compatibility and future integration into existing transportation ecosystems. By prioritizing infrastructure-oriented applications, such as improved traffic flow management, this approach seeks to deliver tangible societal benefits without directly competing with vehicle OEMs. As recent advancement of Generative AI (GenAI), there is no standardized integration of GenAI technologies into open-source CDAs, as the current trends of muiltimodal large language models gain popularity, we demonstrated a feasible locally deployed edge LLM models can enhance driving experience while preserving privacy and security compared to cloud-connected solutions. The proposed system underscores the potential of low-cost, scalable solutions in advancing CDA functionality, paving the way for smarter, safer, and more inclusive transportation networks.

Title: Control Barrier Functions With Real-Time Gaussian Process Modeling
Authors: Ricardo Gutierrez, Jesse B. Hoagg
Abstract: We present an approach for satisfying state constraints in systems with nonparametric uncertainty by estimating this uncertainty with a real-time-update Gaussian process (GP) model. Notably, new data is incorporated into the model in real time as it is obtained and select old data is removed from the model. This update process helps improve the model estimate while keeping the model size (memory required) and computational complexity fixed. We present a recursive formulation for the model update, which reduces time complexity of the update from O(p3) to O(p2), where p is the number of data used. The GP model includes a computable upper bound on the model error. Together, the model and upper bound are used to construct a control-barrier-function (CBF) constraint that guarantees state constraints are satisfied.

Title: HistDiST: Histopathological Diffusion-based Stain Transfer
Authors: Erik Großkopf, Valay Bundele, Mehran Hossienzadeh, Hendrik P.A. Lensch
Abstract: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining is the cornerstone of histopathology but lacks molecular specificity. While Immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides molecular insights, it is costly and complex, motivating H&E-to-IHC translation as a cost-effective alternative. Existing translation methods are mainly GAN-based, often struggling with training instability and limited structural fidelity, while diffusion-based approaches remain underexplored. We propose HistDiST, a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) based framework for high-fidelity H&E-to-IHC translation. HistDiST introduces a dual-conditioning strategy, utilizing Phikon-extracted morphological embeddings alongside VAE-encoded H&E representations to ensure pathology-relevant context and structural consistency. To overcome brightness biases, we incorporate a rescaled noise schedule, v-prediction, and trailing timesteps, enforcing a zero-SNR condition at the final timestep. During inference, DDIM inversion preserves the morphological structure, while an eta-cosine noise schedule introduces controlled stochasticity, balancing structural consistency and molecular fidelity. Moreover, we propose Molecular Retrieval Accuracy (MRA), a novel pathology-aware metric leveraging GigaPath embeddings to assess molecular relevance. Extensive evaluations on MIST and BCI datasets demonstrate that HistDiST significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 28% improvement in MRA on the H&E-to-Ki67 translation task, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing true IHC semantics.

Title: Missing Data Estimation for MR Spectroscopic Imaging via Mask-Free Deep Learning Methods
Authors: Tan-Hanh Pham, Ovidiu C. Andronesi, Xianqi Li, Kim-Doang Nguyen
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) is a powerful tool for non-invasive mapping of brain metabolites, providing critical insights into neurological conditions. However, its utility is often limited by missing or corrupted data due to motion artifacts, magnetic field inhomogeneities, or failed spectral fitting-especially in high resolution 3D acquisitions. To address this, we propose the first deep learning-based, mask-free framework for estimating missing data in MRSI metabolic maps. Unlike conventional restoration methods that rely on explicit masks to identify missing regions, our approach implicitly detects and estimates these areas using contextual spatial features through 2D and 3D U-Net architectures. We also introduce a progressive training strategy to enhance robustness under varying levels of data degradation. Our method is evaluated on both simulated and real patient datasets and consistently outperforms traditional interpolation techniques such as cubic and linear interpolation. The 2D model achieves an MSE of 0.002 and an SSIM of 0.97 with 20% missing voxels, while the 3D model reaches an MSE of 0.001 and an SSIM of 0.98 with 15% missing voxels. Qualitative results show improved fidelity in estimating missing data, particularly in metabolically heterogeneous regions and ventricular regions. Importantly, our model generalizes well to real-world datasets without requiring retraining or mask input. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness and broad applicability of mask-free deep learning for MRSI restoration, with strong potential for clinical and research integration.

Title: Cross-Link Interference Mitigation With Over-the-Air Pilot Forwarding for Dynamic TDD
Authors: Jia-Hui Bi, Shaoshi Yang, Xiao-Yang Wang, Yu-Song Luo, Sheng Chen
Abstract: Dynamic time-division duplex (D-TDD) aided mobile communication systems bear the potential to achieve significantly higher spectral efficiency than traditional static TDD based systems. However, strong cross-link interference (CLI) may be caused by different transmission directions between adjacent cells in D-TDD systems, thus degrading the performance. Most existing CLI mitigation schemes require sharing certain information among base stations (BSs) via backhaul links. This strategy is usually expensive and suffers high latency. Alternatively, we propose a pilot information sharing scheme based on over-the-air forwarding of the downlink pilot of the interfering BS to the interfered BS via a wireless terminal, along with a dedicated CLI channel estimation method. Simulation results demonstrate that thanks to the proposed pilot information sharing scheme the classic interference rejection combining (IRC) receiver achieves a signal detection performance highly comparable to that of the IRC detector with perfect pilot information, necessitating no information sharing among BSs via backhaul links. Furthermore, the proposed CLI channel estimation scheme reduces the impact of errors introduced by pilot forwarding, thereby improving the performance of both CLI channel estimation and signal detection.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive real-world and Digital Twin (DT) dataset collected as part of the Find A Rover (AFAR) Challenge, organized by the NSF Aerial Experimentation and Research Platform for Advanced Wireless (AERPAW) testbed and hosted at the Lake Wheeler Field in Raleigh, North Carolina. The AFAR Challenge was a competition involving five finalist university teams, focused on promoting innovation in UAV-assisted radio frequency (RF) source localization. Participating teams were tasked with designing UAV flight trajectories and localization algorithms to detect the position of a hidden unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), also referred to as a rover, emitting wireless probe signals generated by GNU Radio. The competition was structured to evaluate solutions in a DT environment first, followed by deployment and testing in AERPAW's outdoor wireless testbed. For each team, the UGV was placed at three different positions, resulting in a total of 30 datasets, 15 collected in a DT simulation environment and 15 in a physical outdoor testbed. Each dataset contains time-synchronized measurements of received signal strength (RSS), received signal quality (RSQ), GPS coordinates, UAV velocity, and UAV orientation (roll, pitch, and yaw). Data is organized into structured folders by team, environment (DT and real-world), and UGV location. The dataset supports research in UAV-assisted RF source localization, air-to-ground (A2G) wireless propagation modeling, trajectory optimization, signal prediction, autonomous navigation, and DT validation. With approximately 300k time-synchronized samples collected from real-world experiments, the dataset provides a substantial foundation for training and evaluating deep learning (DL) models. Overall, the AFAR dataset serves as a valuable resource for advancing robust, real-world solutions in UAV-enabled wireless communications and sensing systems.

Title: Secure Safety Filter Design for Sampled-data Nonlinear Systems under Sensor Spoofing Attacks
Authors: Xiao Tan, Pio Ong, Paulo Tabuada, Aaron D. Ames
Abstract: This paper presents a secure safety filter design for nonlinear systems under sensor spoofing attacks. Existing approaches primarily focus on linear systems which limits their applications in real-world scenarios. In this work, we extend these results to nonlinear systems in a principled way. We introduce exact observability maps that abstract specific state estimation algorithms and extend them to a secure version capable of handling sensor attacks. Our generalization also applies to the relaxed observability case, with slightly relaxed guarantees. More importantly, we propose a secure safety filter design in both exact and relaxed cases, which incorporates secure state estimation and a control barrier function-enabled safety filter. The proposed approach provides theoretical safety guarantees for nonlinear systems in the presence of sensor attacks. We numerically validate our analysis on a unicycle vehicle equipped with redundant yet partly compromised sensors.

Title: Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Leaderless UAV Formation Flying with Collision Avoidance under Directed Graphs
Authors: Yiming Wang, Yao Fang, Jie Mei, Youmin Gong, Guangfu Ma
Abstract: This paper studies the leaderless formation flying problem with collision avoidance for a group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which requires the UAVs to navigate through cluttered environments without colliding while maintaining the formation. The communication network among the UAVs is structured as a directed graph that includes a directed spanning tree. A novel distributed nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) method based on the model reference adaptive consensus (MRACon) framework is proposed. Within this framework, each UAV tracks an assigned reference output generated by a linear reference model that utilizes relative measurements as input. Subsequently, the NMPC method penalizes the tracking error between the output of the reference model and that of the actual model while also establishing constraint sets for collision avoidance and physical limitations to achieve distributed and safe formation control. Finally, simulations and hardware experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: Near-Field Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO: A Deep Generative Model Guided by Side Information
Authors: Zhenzhou Jin, Li You, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng, Xiang-Gen Xia, Xiqi Gao
Abstract: This paper investigates the near-field (NF) channel estimation (CE) for extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems. Considering the pronounced NF effects in XL-MIMO communications, we first establish a joint angle-distance (AD) domain-based spherical-wavefront physical channel model that captures the inherent sparsity of XL-MIMO channels. Leveraging the channel's sparsity in the joint AD domain, the CE is approached as a task of reconstructing sparse signals. Anchored in this framework, we first propose a compressed sensing algorithm to acquire a preliminary channel estimate. Harnessing the powerful implicit prior learning capability of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), we further propose a GenAI-based approach to refine the estimated channel. Specifically, we introduce the preliminary estimated channel as side information, and derive the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the log-marginal distribution of the target NF channel conditioned on the preliminary estimated channel, which serves as the optimization objective for the proposed generative diffusion model (GDM). Additionally, we introduce a more generalized version of the GDM, the non-Markovian GDM (NM-GDM), to accelerate the sampling process, achieving an approximately tenfold enhancement in sampling efficiency. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is capable of offering substantial performance gain in CE compared to existing benchmark schemes within NF XL-MIMO systems. Furthermore, our approach exhibits enhanced generalization capabilities in both the NF or far-field (FF) regions.

Title: Time-Modulated EM Skins for Integrated Sensing and Communications
Authors: Lorenzo Poli, Aakash Bansal, Giacomo Oliveri, Aaron Angel Salas-Sanchez, Will Whittow, Andrea Massa
Abstract: An innovative solution, based on the exploitation of the harmonic beams generated by time-modulated electromagnetic skins (TM-EMSs), is proposed for the implementation of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) functionalities in a Smart Electromagnetic Environment (SEME) scenario. More in detail, the field radiated by a user terminal, located at an unknown position, is assumed to illuminate a passive TM-EMS that, thanks to a suitable modulation of the local reflection coefficients at the meta-atom level of the EMS surface, simultaneously reflects towards a receiving base station (BS) a "sum" beam and a "difference" one at slightly different frequencies. By processing the received signals and exploiting monopulse radar tracking concepts, the BS both localizes the user terminal and, as a by-product, establishes a communication link with it by leveraging on the "sum" reflected beam. Towards this purpose, the arising harmonic beam control problem is reformulated as a global optimization one, which is successively solved by means of an evolutionary iterative approach to determine the desired TM-EMS modulation sequence. The results from selected numerical and experimental tests are reported to assess the effectiveness and the reliability of the proposed approach.

Authors: Yanhui Hong, Nan Wang, Zhiyi Xia, Haoyi Tao, Xi Fang, Yiming Li, Jiankun Wang, Peng Jin, Xiaochen Cai, Shengyu Li, Ziqi Chen, Zezhong Zhang, Guolin Ke, Linfeng Zhang
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic solution for the intelligent recognition and automatic analysis of microscopy images. We developed a data engine that generates high-quality annotated datasets through a combination of the collection of diverse microscopy images from experiments, synthetic data generation and a human-in-the-loop annotation process. To address the unique challenges of microscopy images, we propose a segmentation model capable of robustly detecting both small and large objects. The model effectively identifies and separates thousands of closely situated targets, even in cluttered visual environments. Furthermore, our solution supports the precise automatic recognition of image scale bars, an essential feature in quantitative microscopic analysis. Building upon these components, we have constructed a comprehensive intelligent analysis platform and validated its effectiveness and practicality in real-world applications. This study not only advances automatic recognition in microscopy imaging but also ensures scalability and generalizability across multiple application domains, offering a powerful tool for automated microscopic analysis in interdisciplinary research.

Title: Optimal Current Control Strategy for Reliable Power Electronics Converters: Frequency-Domain Approach
Authors: Amin Rezaeizadeh, Silvia Mastellone
Abstract: Power electronics converters are key enablers in the global energy transition for power generation, industrial and mobility applications; they convert electrical power in a controlled, reliable and efficient manner. The semiconductor switching devices, at the core of power converters, are the most likely component to fail due to the damage caused by the current-induced temperature cycling. Damage models of semiconductors have been developed and employed to study their reliability, improve their design and to estimate the lifetime of the converter in various power applications. However, those models can offer more if employed in the design of strategies to actively operate the converter. Specifically, properly controlling the current, and hence the temperature cycling, can effectively contribute to reducing the accumulated damage in the semiconductor and increase its reliability and lifetime. In this paper we propose a novel current control approach that integrates reliability requirements into the design framework, based on a frequency-domain model of the semiconductor damage.

Title: Whitened CLIP as a Likelihood Surrogate of Images and Captions
Authors: Roy Betser, Meir Yossef Levi, Guy Gilboa
Abstract: Likelihood approximations for images are not trivial to compute and can be useful in many applications. We examine the use of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) to assess the likelihood of images and captions. We introduce \textit{Whitened CLIP}, a novel transformation of the CLIP latent space via an invertible linear operation. This transformation ensures that each feature in the embedding space has zero mean, unit standard deviation, and no correlation with all other features, resulting in an identity covariance matrix. We show that the whitened embeddings statistics can be well approximated as a standard normal distribution, thus, the log-likelihood is estimated simply by the square Euclidean norm in the whitened embedding space. The whitening procedure is completely training-free and performed using a pre-computed whitening matrix, hence, is very fast. We present several preliminary experiments demonstrating the properties and applicability of these likelihood scores to images and captions.

Title: Robust Control of Uncertain Switched Affine Systems via Scenario Optimization
Authors: Negar Monir, Mahdieh S. Sadabadi, Sadegh Soudjani
Abstract: Switched affine systems are often used to model and control complex dynamical systems that operate in multiple modes. However, uncertainties in the system matrices can challenge their stability and performance. This paper introduces a new approach for designing switching control laws for uncertain switched affine systems using data-driven scenario optimization. Instead of relaxing invariant sets, our method creates smaller invariant sets with quadratic Lyapunov functions through scenario-based optimization, effectively reducing chattering effects and regulation error. The framework ensures robustness against parameter uncertainties while improving accuracy. We validate our method with applications in multi-objective interval Markov decision processes and power electronic converters, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Title: Decentralized Stealth Attacks on Cyber-Physical Systems
Authors: Xiuzhen Ye, Inaki Esnaola, Samir M. Perlaza, Robert F. Harrison
Abstract: Decentralized stealth attack constructions that minimize the mutual information between the state variables and the measurements are proposed. The attack constructions are formulated as random Gaussian attacks targeting Cyber-physical systems that aims at minimizing the mutual information between the state variables and measurements while constraining the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the distribution of the measurements under attacks and the distribution of the measurements without attacks. The proposed information metrics adopted measure the disruption and attack detection both globally and locally. The decentralized attack constructions are formulated in a framework of normal games. The global and local information metrics yield games with global and local objectives in disruption and attack detection. We have proven the games are potential games and the convexity of the potential functions followed by the uniqueness and the achievability of the Nash Equilibrium, accordingly. We proposed a best response dynamics to achieve the Nash Equilibrium of the games. We numerically evaluate the performance of the proposed decentralized stealth random attacks on IEEE test systems and show it is feasible to exploit game theoretic techniques in decentralized attack constructions.

Title: Design and Experimental Test of Datatic Approximate Optimal Filter in Nonlinear Dynamic Systems
Authors: Weixian He, Zeyu He, Wenhan Cao, Haoyu Gao, Tong Liu, Bin Shuai, Chang Liu, Shengbo Eben Li
Abstract: Filtering is crucial in engineering fields, providing vital state estimation for control systems. However, the nonlinear nature of complex systems and the presence of non-Gaussian noises pose significant challenges to the performance of conventional filtering methods in terms of estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. In this work, we present a data-driven closed-loop filter, termed datatic approximate optimal filter (DAOF), specifically designed for nonlinear systems under non-Gaussian conditions. We first formulate a Markovian filtering problem (MFP), which inherently shares a connection with reinforcement learning (RL) as it aims to compute the optimal state estimate by minimizing the accumulated error. To solve MFP, we propose DAOF, which primarily incorporates a trained RL policy and features two distinct structural designs: DAOF-v1 and DAOF-v2. Designed for systems with explicit models, DAOF-v1 combines prediction and update phases, with the RL policy generating the update value. Meanwhile, DAOF-v2 bypasses system modeling by directly outputting the state estimate. Then, we utilize an actor-critic algorithm to learn the parameterized policy for DAOF. Experimental results on a 2-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) vehicle system, equipped with explicit system models, demonstrate the superior accuracy and computational efficiency of DAOF-v1 compared to existing nonlinear filters. Moreover, DAOF-v2 showcases its unique ability to perform filtering without requiring explicit system modeling, as validated by a 14-DOF vehicle system.

Title: YANNs: Y-wise Affine Neural Networks for Exact and Efficient Representations of Piecewise Linear Functions
Authors: Austin Braniff, Yuhe Tian
Abstract: This work formally introduces Y-wise Affine Neural Networks (YANNs), a fully-explainable network architecture that continuously and efficiently represent piecewise affine functions with polytopic subdomains. Following from the proofs, it is shown that the development of YANNs requires no training to achieve the functionally equivalent representation. YANNs thus maintain all mathematical properties of the original formulations. Multi-parametric model predictive control is utilized as an application showcase of YANNs, which theoretically computes optimal control laws as a piecewise affine function of states, outputs, setpoints, and disturbances. With the exact representation of multi-parametric control laws, YANNs retain essential control-theoretic guarantees such as recursive feasibility and stability. This sets YANNs apart from the existing works which apply neural networks for approximating optimal control laws instead of exactly representing them. By optimizing the inference speed of the networks, YANNs can evaluate substantially faster in real-time compared to traditional piecewise affine function calculations. Numerical case studies are presented to demonstrate the algorithmic scalability with respect to the input/output dimensions and the number of subdomains. YANNs represent a significant advancement in control as the first neural network-based controller that inherently ensures both feasibility and stability. Future applications can leverage them as an efficient and interpretable starting point for data-driven modeling/control.

Title: OPTIKS: Optimized Gradient Properties Through Timing in K-Space
Authors: Matthew A. McCready, Xiaozhi Cao, Kawin Setsompop, John M. Pauly, Adam B. Kerr
Abstract: A customizable method (OPTIKS) for designing fast trajectory-constrained gradient waveforms with optimized time domain properties was developed. Given a specified multidimensional k-space trajectory, the method optimizes traversal speed (and therefore timing) with position along the trajectory. OPTIKS facilitates optimization of objectives dependent on the time domain gradient waveform and the arc-length domain k-space speed. OPTIKS is applied to design waveforms which limit peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), minimize mechanical resonance excitation, and reduce acoustic noise. A variety of trajectory examples are presented including spirals, circular echo-planar-imaging, and rosettes. Design performance is evaluated based on duration, standardized PNS models, field measurements, gradient coil back-EMF measurements, and calibrated acoustic measurements. We show reductions in back-EMF of up to 94% and field oscillations up to 91.1%, acoustic noise decreases of up to 9.22 dB, and with efficient use of PNS models speed increases of up to 11.4%. The design method implementation is made available as an open source Python package through GitHub.

Authors: Jong Sung Park, Juhyung Ha, Siddhesh Thakur, Alexandra Badea, Spyridon Bakas, Eleftherios Garyfallidis
Abstract: While many skull stripping algorithms have been developed for multi-modal and multi-species cases, there is still a lack of a fundamentally generalizable approach. We present PUMBA(PUrely synthetic Multimodal/species invariant Brain extrAction), a strategy to train a model for brain extraction with no real brain images or labels. Our results show that even without any real images or anatomical priors, the model achieves comparable accuracy in multi-modal, multi-species and pathological cases. This work presents a new direction of research for any generalizable medical image segmentation task.

Title: Metrics that matter: Evaluating image quality metrics for medical image generation
Authors: Yash Deo, Yan Jia, Toni Lassila, William A. P. Smith, Tom Lawton, Siyuan Kang, Alejandro F. Frangi, Ibrahim Habli
Abstract: Evaluating generative models for synthetic medical imaging is crucial yet challenging, especially given the high standards of fidelity, anatomical accuracy, and safety required for clinical applications. Standard evaluation of generated images often relies on no-reference image quality metrics when ground truth images are unavailable, but their reliability in this complex domain is not well established. This study comprehensively assesses commonly used no-reference image quality metrics using brain MRI data, including tumour and vascular images, providing a representative exemplar for the field. We systematically evaluate metric sensitivity to a range of challenges, including noise, distribution shifts, and, critically, localised morphological alterations designed to mimic clinically relevant inaccuracies. We then compare these metric scores against model performance on a relevant downstream segmentation task, analysing results across both controlled image perturbations and outputs from different generative model architectures. Our findings reveal significant limitations: many widely-used no-reference image quality metrics correlate poorly with downstream task suitability and exhibit a profound insensitivity to localised anatomical details crucial for clinical validity. Furthermore, these metrics can yield misleading scores regarding distribution shifts, e.g. data memorisation. This reveals the risk of misjudging model readiness, potentially leading to the deployment of flawed tools that could compromise patient safety. We conclude that ensuring generative models are truly fit for clinical purpose requires a multifaceted validation framework, integrating performance on relevant downstream tasks with the cautious interpretation of carefully selected no-reference image quality metrics.

Title: Economic data-enabled predictive control using machine learning
Authors: Mingxue Yan, Xuewen Zhang, Kaixiang Zhang, Zhaojian Li, Xunyuan Yin
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a convex data-based economic predictive control method within the framework of data-enabled predictive control (DeePC). Specifically, we use a neural network to transform the system output into a new state space, where the nonlinear economic cost function of the underlying nonlinear system is approximated using a quadratic function expressed by the transformed output in the new state space. Both the neural network parameters and the coefficients of the quadratic function are learned from open-loop data of the system. Additionally, we reconstruct constrained output variables from the transformed output through learning an output reconstruction matrix; this way, the proposed economic DeePC can handle output constraints explicitly. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated via a case study in a simulated chemical process.

Title: A Unified Deterministic Channel Model for Multi-Type RIS with Reflective, Transmissive, and Polarization Operations
Authors: Yuxiang Zhang, Jianhua Zhang, Zhengfu Zhou, Huiwen Gong, Hongbo Xing, Zhiqiang Yuan, Lei Tian, Li Yu, Guangyi Liu, Tao Jiang
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) technologies have been considered as a promising enabler for 6G, enabling advantageous control of electromagnetic (EM) propagation. RIS can be categorized into multiple types based on their reflective/transmissive modes and polarization control capabilities, all of which are expected to be widely deployed in practical environments. A reliable RIS channel model is essential for the design and development of RIS communication systems. While deterministic modeling approaches such as ray-tracing (RT) offer significant benefits, a unified model that accommodates all RIS types is still lacking. This paper addresses this gap by developing a high-precision deterministic channel model based on RT, supporting multiple RIS types: reflective, transmissive, hybrid, and three polarization operation modes. To achieve this, a unified EM response model for the aforementioned RIS types is developed. The reflection and transmission coefficients of RIS elements are derived using a tensor-based equivalent impedance approach, followed by calculating the scattered fields of the RIS to establish an EM response model. The performance of different RIS types is compared through simulations in typical scenarios. During this process, passive and lossless constraints on the reflection and transmission coefficients are incorporated to ensure fairness in the performance evaluation. Simulation results validate the framework's accuracy in characterizing the RIS channel, and specific cases tailored for dual-polarization independent control and polarization rotating RISs are highlighted as insights for their future deployment. This work can be helpful for the evaluation and optimization of RIS-enabled wireless communication systems.

Title: A Novel Online Pseudospectral Method for Approximation of Nonlinear Systems Dynamics
Authors: Arian Yousefian, Avimanyu Sahoo, Vignesh Narayanan
Abstract: This paper presents a novel online system identification approach utilizing the Chebyshev pseudospectral (PS) method to approximate the dynamics of a continuous-time nonlinear system. Unlike conventional periodic sampling, the proposed identification scheme employs aperiodic state sampling, leveraging the Chebyshev nodes to achieve the desired approximation accuracy. Unlike traditional off-line PS approaches, the scheme utilizes a moving time-window strategy to compute the sampling instants (Chebyshev nodes) forward in time for state measurements. Within each time window, the number of sampling instants is adaptively determined to meet the specified approximation accuracy. The Chebyshev basis is also shifted for each time window to accommodate arbitrary approximation intervals. The least-squares approach is employed to estimate the coefficients of the shifted Chebyshev basis functions using the measured state and its derivatives at the end of each window, resulting in a piecewise approximation of the drift dynamics of the system. In the second step, the identified drift dynamics are utilized to design an adaptive state estimator to reconstruct the continuous system states from the aperiodic state measurements. To address the smoothness of the piecewise approximated system dynamics, the Chebyshev coefficients are recomputed at the window transition instants, between two consecutive time windows, by enforcing continuity of the approximated function and its derivatives. In addition, analytical results are provided to determine the number of sampling instants within each time window, which guarantees the desired approximation accuracy. The boundedness of function approximation and state estimation errors is also proved analytically. Finally, numerical simulation results are included to validate the proposed scheme.

Title: Continuous-Time Control Synthesis for Multiple Quadrotors under Signal Temporal Logic Specifications
Authors: Yating Yuan
Abstract: Ensuring continuous-time control of multiple quadrotors in constrained environments under signal temporal logic (STL) specifications is challenging due to nonlinear dynamics, safety constraints, and disturbances. This letter proposes a two-stage framework to address this challenge. First, exponentially decaying tracking error bounds are derived with multidimensional geometric control gains obtained via differential evolution. These bounds are less conservative, while the resulting tracking errors exhibit smaller oscillations and improved transient performance. Second, leveraging the time-varying bounds, a mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) formulation generates piecewise Bézier reference trajectories that satisfy STL and velocity limits, while ensuring inter-agent safety through convex-hull properties. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach enables formally verifiable multi-agent coordination in constrained environments, with provable tracking guarantees under bounded disturbances.

Title: Sparse Arrays Enable Near-Field Constant-Distance Focusing with Reduced Focal Shift
Authors: Jiawang Li, Yingjie Xu, Hanieh Aliakbari
Abstract: In near-field beam focusing for finite-sized arrays, focal shift is a non-negligible issue. The actual focal point often appears closer to the array than the predefined focal distance, significantly degrading the focusing performance of finite aperture arrays. Moreover, when the focus point is scanned across different locations, the degradation becomes even more pronounced, leading not only to positional deviation but also to substantial energy loss. To address this issue, we revisit the problem from the perspective of communication degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that a properly designed sparse array with optimized element spacing can effectively mitigate focal shift while enabling stable control of the focusing height during beam scanning. Simulation results based on dipole antennas with different polarizations and patch antennas validate our findings. Notably, with optimized inter-element distances, the energy distribution across focal points becomes nearly uniform, and highly accurate focusing positions are achieved.

Title: Swarm Antenna Arrays: From Deterministic to Stochastic Modeling
Authors: Tiebin Mi, Miyu Feng, Ruichu Shao, Cao Zeng, Robert Caiming Qiu
Abstract: Swarm antenna arrays, composed of spatially distributed antennas mounted on unmanned agents, offer unprecedented flexibility and adaptability for wireless sensing and communication. However, their reconfigurable architecture, susceptibility to collisions, and inherently stochastic nature present significant challenges to realizing collaborative gain. It remains unclear how spatial coordination, positional perturbations, and large-scale topological configurations affect coherent signal aggregation and overall system performance. This paper investigates the feasibility of achieving coherent beamforming in such systems from both deterministic and stochastic perspectives. First, we develop a rigorous theoretical framework that characterizes the necessary and sufficient conditions for the emergence of grating lobes in multiple linear configurations. Notably, we show that for dual linear arrays, the classical half-wavelength spacing constraint can be safely relaxed without introducing spatial aliasing. This result challenges traditional array design principles and enables more flexible, collision-aware topologies. Second, we present a theoretical analysis, supported by empirical validation, demonstrating that coherent gain can be approximately preserved under realistic positional perturbations. Our results reveal that spatial perturbations introduce measurable degradation in the main lobe, an effect that cannot be mitigated merely by increasing the number of antennas. Instead, the primary benefit of scaling lies in reducing the variance of perturbation-induced fluctuations.

Title: Multi-Plane Vision Transformer for Hemorrhage Classification Using Axial and Sagittal MRI Data
Authors: Badhan Kumar Das, Gengyan Zhao, Boris Mailhe, Thomas J. Re, Dorin Comaniciu, Eli Gibson, Andreas Maier
Abstract: Identifying brain hemorrhages from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a critical task for healthcare professionals. The diverse nature of MRI acquisitions with varying contrasts and orientation introduce complexity in identifying hemorrhage using neural networks. For acquisitions with varying orientations, traditional methods often involve resampling images to a fixed plane, which can lead to information loss. To address this, we propose a 3D multi-plane vision transformer (MP-ViT) for hemorrhage classification with varying orientation data. It employs two separate transformer encoders for axial and sagittal contrasts, using cross-attention to integrate information across orientations. MP-ViT also includes a modality indication vector to provide missing contrast information to the model. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated with extensive experiments on real world clinical dataset consists of 10,084 training, 1,289 validation and 1,496 test subjects. MP-ViT achieved substantial improvement in area under the curve (AUC), outperforming the vision transformer (ViT) by 5.5% and CNN-based architectures by 1.8%. These results highlight the potential of MP-ViT in improving performance for hemorrhage detection when different orientation contrasts are needed.

Title: Computational Imaging-Based ISAC Method with Large Pixel Division
Authors: Xin Tong, Zhaoyang Zhang, Zhaohui Yang, Yu Ge, Henk Wymeersch
Abstract: One of the key points in designing an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system using computational imaging is the division size of imaging pixels. If the size is too small, it leads to a high number of pixels that need processing. On the contrary, it usually causes large processing errors since each pixel is no longer uniformly coherent. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to address such a problem in environment sensing in millimeter-wave wireless cellular networks, which effectively cancels the severe errors caused by large pixel division as in conventional computational imaging algorithms. To this end, a novel computational imaging model in an integral form is introduced, which leverages the continuous characteristics of object surfaces in the environment and takes into account the different phases associated with the different parts of the pixel. The proposed algorithm extends computational imaging to large wireless communication scenarios for the first time. The performance of the proposed method is then analyzed, and extensive numerical results verify its effectiveness.

Title: High Performance Signal Design for ACO-OFDM Systems using Variational Autoencoder
Authors: Nam N. Luong, Chuyen T. Nguyen, Thanh V. Pham
Abstract: This letter proposes a design of low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), low symbol error rate (SER), and high data rate signal for asymmetrically clipped optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (ACO-OFDM) systems. The proposed design leverages a variational autoencoder (VAE) incorporating gradual loss learning to jointly optimize the geometry and probability of the constellation's symbols. This not only enhances mutual information (MI) but also effectively reduces the PAPR while maintaining a low SER for reliable transmission. We evaluate the performance of the proposed VAE-based design by comparing the MI, SER, and PAPR against existing techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a considerably lower PAPR while maintaining superior SER and MI performance for a wide range of SNRs.

Title: GAN-based synthetic FDG PET images from T1 brain MRI can serve to improve performance of deep unsupervised anomaly detection models
Authors: Daria Zotova (MYRIAD), Nicolas Pinon (MYRIAD), Robin Trombetta (MYRIAD), Romain Bouet (CRNL), Julien Jung (CRNL, HCL), Carole Lartizien (MYRIAD)
Abstract: Background and Objective. Research in the cross-modal medical image translation domain has been very productive over the past few years in tackling the scarce availability of large curated multimodality datasets with the promising performance of GAN-based architectures. However, only a few of these studies assessed task-based related performance of these synthetic data, especially for the training of deep models. Method. We design and compare different GAN-based frameworks for generating synthetic brain [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET images from T1 weighted MRI data. We first perform standard qualitative and quantitative visual quality evaluation. Then, we explore further impact of using these fake PET data in the training of a deep unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) model designed to detect subtle epilepsy lesions in T1 MRI and FDG PET images. We introduce novel diagnostic task-oriented quality metrics of the synthetic FDG PET data tailored to our unsupervised detection task, then use these fake data to train a use case UAD model combining a deep representation learning based on siamese autoencoders with a OC-SVM density support estimation model. This model is trained on normal subjects only and allows the detection of any variation from the pattern of the normal population. We compare the detection performance of models trained on 35 paired real MR T1 of normal subjects paired either on 35 true PET images or on 35 synthetic PET images generated from the best performing generative models. Performance analysis is conducted on 17 exams of epilepsy patients undergoing surgery. Results. The best performing GAN-based models allow generating realistic fake PET images of control subject with SSIM and PSNR values around 0.9 and 23.8, respectively and in distribution (ID) with regard to the true control dataset. The best UAD model trained on these synthetic normative PET data allows reaching 74% sensitivity. Conclusion. Our results confirm that GAN-based models are the best suited for MR T1 to FDG PET translation, outperforming transformer or diffusion models. We also demonstrate the diagnostic value of these synthetic data for the training of UAD models and evaluation on clinical exams of epilepsy patients. Our code and the normative image dataset are available.

Title: Towards a physically realistic computationally efficient DVS pixel model
Authors: Rui Graca, Tobi Delbruck
Abstract: Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) event camera models are important tools for predicting camera response, optimizing biases, and generating realistic simulated datasets. Existing DVS models have been useful, but have not demonstrated high realism for challenging HDR scenes combined with adequate computational efficiency for array-level scene simulation. This paper reports progress towards a physically realistic and computationally efficient DVS model based on large-signal differential equations derived from circuit analysis, with parameters fitted from pixel measurements and circuit simulation. These are combined with an efficient stochastic event generation mechanism based on first-passage-time theory, allowing accurate noise generation with timesteps greater than 1000x longer than previous methods

Title: Pilot-Based End-to-End Radio Positioning and Mapping for ISAC: Beyond Point-Based Landmarks
Authors: Yu Ge, Musa Furkan Keskin, Hui Chen, Ossi Kaltiokallio, Mengting Li, Mikko Valkama, Christos Masouros, Henk Wymeersch
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication enables simultaneous communication and sensing tasks, including precise radio positioning and mapping, essential for future 6G networks. Current methods typically model environmental landmarks as isolated incidence points or small reflection areas, lacking detailed attributes essential for advanced environmental interpretation. This paper addresses these limitations by developing an end-to-end cooperative uplink framework involving multiple base stations and users. Our method uniquely estimates extended landmark objects and incorporates obstruction-based outlier removal to mitigate multi-bounce signal effects. Validation using realistic ray-tracing data demonstrates substantial improvements in the richness of the estimated environmental map.

Title: Energy personas in Danish households
Authors: Nadine Sandjo Tchatchoua (Roskilde University), Line Valdorff Madsen (Aalborg University), Anders Rhiger Hansen (Aalborg University)
Abstract: Technologies to monitor the provision of renewable energy are part of emerging technologies to help address the discrepancy between renewable energy production and its related usage in households. This paper presents various ways householders use a technological artifact for the real-time monitoring of renewable energy provision. Such a monitoring thus affords householders with an opportunity to adjust their energy consumption according to renewable energy provision. In Denmark, Ewii, previously Barry, is a Danish energy supplier which provides householders with an opportunity to monitor energy sources in real time through a technological solution of the same name. This paper use provision afforded by Ewii as a case for exploring how householders organize themselves to use a technological artefact that supports the monitoring of energy and its related usage. This study aims to inform technology design through the derivation of four personas. The derived personas highlight the differences in energy monitoring practices for the householders and their engagement. These personas are characterised as dedicated, organised, sporadic, and convenient. Understanding these differences in energy monitoring practice using the technological artefact form a solid element in the design of future energy technologies that interfere with the everyday practices and energy consumption for households. This is paramount for future energy related technology design, and for the clarification of usage assumptions that are embedded in the rollout of energy related technology as a country such as Denmark moves through its green transition.

Title: Cognitive Non-Coherent Jamming Techniques for Frequency Selective Attacks
Authors: Massimo Rosamilia, Augusto Aubry, Vincenzo Carotenuto, Antonio De Maio
Abstract: This paper deals with the design of non-coherent jamming strategies capable of ensuring spectral compatibility with friendly radio frequency (RF) emitters. The goal is achieved via a cognitive approach, which, after recognizing the presence of friendly RF systems within the bandwidth of interest (perception), synthesizes a jamming waveform (action) with spectral notches, that allows to interfere exclusively with opposite emissions. Two methods are proposed for the synthesis of the jamming signal. The former leverages optimization techniques for quadratically constrained quadratic problems (QCQP) where each constraint embeds the interference level tolerable by a specific friendly RF system. The latter is a very computationally efficient approach based on simple projections, allowing a control over the spectral notch positions and widths. At the analysis stage, the performance of the devised jamming techniques is firstly numerically analyzed in terms of spectral occupancy and autocorrelation characteristics. The impact of the quantization process involved in the digital-to-analog conversion (DAC) of the jamming waveforms is also examined, with a particular focus on the spectral shaping impairments resulting from reduced DAC resolution. Finally, waveform transmission and reception is experimentally assessed with software defined radio (SDR) devices.

Title: Ophora: A Large-Scale Data-Driven Text-Guided Ophthalmic Surgical Video Generation Model
Authors: Wei Li, Ming Hu, Guoan Wang, Lihao Liu, Kaijin Zhou, Junzhi Ning, Xin Guo, Zongyuan Ge, Lixu Gu, Junjun He
Abstract: In ophthalmic surgery, developing an AI system capable of interpreting surgical videos and predicting subsequent operations requires numerous ophthalmic surgical videos with high-quality annotations, which are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns and labor consumption. Text-guided video generation (T2V) emerges as a promising solution to overcome this issue by generating ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. In this paper, we present Ophora, a pioneering model that can generate ophthalmic surgical videos following natural language instructions. To construct Ophora, we first propose a Comprehensive Data Curation pipeline to convert narrative ophthalmic surgical videos into a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising over 160K video-instruction pairs, Ophora-160K. Then, we propose a Progressive Video-Instruction Tuning scheme to transfer rich spatial-temporal knowledge from a T2V model pre-trained on natural video-text datasets for privacy-preserved ophthalmic surgical video generation based on Ophora-160K. Experiments on video quality evaluation via quantitative analysis and ophthalmologist feedback demonstrate that Ophora can generate realistic and reliable ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. We also validate the capability of Ophora for empowering downstream tasks of ophthalmic surgical workflow understanding. Code is available at this https URL.

Title: Optimal Low Emission Zones scheduling as an example of transport policy backcasting
Authors: Asmae Alami, Vinith Lakshmanan, Antonio Sciarretta
Abstract: This study presents a backcasting approach that considers the passenger car fleet dynamics to determine optimal policy roadmaps in transport systems. As opposed to the scenario-based approach, backcasting sets emission reduction targets first, then identifies policies that meet the constraint. The policy is the implementation of Low Emission Zones (LEZs), in the Ile-de-France region as a case study. The aim is to minimize the number of scrapped vehicles due to LEZs under CO2 emission targets and to deduce an interdiction schedule of polluting vehicles by 2050. To explore potential solutions, we use a genetic algorithm that provides a first insight into optimal policy pathways.

Title: Integrated Localization and Path Planning for an Ocean Exploring Team of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles with Consensus Graph Model Predictive Control
Authors: Mohsen Eskandari, Andrey V. Savkin, Mohammad Deghat
Abstract: Navigation of a team of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) coordinated by an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) is efficient and reliable for deep ocean exploration. AUVs depart from and return to the USV after collaborative navigation, data collection, and ocean exploration missions. Efficient path planning and accurate localization are essential, the latter of which is critical due to the lack of global localization signals and poor radio frequency (RF) communication in deep waters. Inertial navigation and acoustic communication are common solutions for localization. However, the former is subject to odometry drifts, and the latter is limited to short distances. This paper proposes a systematic approach for localization-aware energy-efficient collision-free path planning for a USV-AUVs team. Path planning is formulated as finite receding horizon model predictive control (MPC) optimization. A dynamic-aware linear kinodynamic motion equation is developed. The mathematical formulation for the MPC optimization is effectively developed where localization is integrated as consensus graph optimization among AUV nodes. Edges in the optimized AUV-to-USV (A2U) and AUV-to-AUV (A2A) graphs are constrained to the sonar range of acoustic modems. The time complexity of the consensus MPC optimization problem is analyzed, revealing a nonconvex NP-hard problem, which is solved using sequential convex programming. Numerical simulation results are provided to evaluate the proposed method.

Title: Evaluating the Scalability of Binary and Ternary CNN Workloads on RRAM-based Compute-in-Memory Accelerators
Authors: José Cubero-Cascante, Rebecca Pelke, Noah Flohr, Arunkumar Vaidyanathan, Rainer Leupers, Jan Moritz Joseph
Abstract: The increasing computational demand of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) necessitates energy-efficient acceleration strategies. Compute-in-Memory (CIM) architectures based on Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) offer a promising solution by reducing data movement and enabling low-power in-situ computations. However, their efficiency is limited by the high cost of peripheral circuits, particularly Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). Large crossbars and low ADC resolutions are often used to mitigate this, potentially compromising accuracy. This work introduces novel simulation methods to model the impact of resistive wire parasitics and limited ADC resolution on RRAM crossbars. Our parasitics model employs a vectorised algorithm to compute crossbar output currents with errors below 0.15% compared to SPICE. Additionally, we propose a variable step-size ADC and a calibration methodology that significantly reduces ADC resolution requirements. These accuracy models are integrated with a statistics-based energy model. Using our framework, we conduct a comparative analysis of binary and ternary CNNs. Experimental results demonstrate that the ternary CNNs exhibit greater resilience to wire parasitics and lower ADC resolution but suffer a 40% reduction in energy efficiency. These findings provide valuable insights for optimising RRAM-based CIM accelerators for energy-efficient deep learning.

Title: Space-Time Beamforming for LEO Satellite Communications
Authors: Jungbin Yim, Jinseok Choi, Jeonghun Park, Ian P. Roberts, Namyoon Lee
Abstract: Inter-beam interference poses a significant challenge in low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications due to dense satellite constellations. To address this issue, we introduce spacetime beamforming, a novel paradigm that leverages the spacetime channel vector, uniquely determined by the angle of arrival (AoA) and relative Doppler shift, to optimize beamforming between a moving satellite transmitter and a ground station user. We propose two space-time beamforming techniques: spacetime zero-forcing (ST-ZF) and space-time signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio (ST-SLNR) maximization. In a partially connected interference channel, ST-ZF achieves a 3dB SNR gain over the conventional interference avoidance method using maximum ratio transmission beamforming. Moreover, in general interference networks, ST-SLNR beamforming significantly enhances sum spectral efficiency compared to conventional interference management approaches. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of space-time beamforming in improving spectral efficiency and interference mitigation for next-generation LEO satellite networks.

Title: Physics-Informed Topological Signal Processing for Water Distribution Network Monitoring
Authors: Tiziana Cattai, Stefania Sardellitti, Stefania Colonnese, Francesca Cuomo, Sergio Barbarossa
Abstract: Water management is one of the most critical aspects of our society, together with population increase and climate change. Water scarcity requires a better characterization and monitoring of Water Distribution Networks (WDNs). This paper presents a novel framework for monitoring Water Distribution Networks (WDNs) by integrating physics-informed modeling of the nonlinear interactions between pressure and flow data with Topological Signal Processing (TSP) techniques. We represent pressure and flow data as signals defined over a second-order cell complex, enabling accurate estimation of water pressures and flows throughout the entire network from sparse sensor measurements. By formalizing hydraulic conservation laws through the TSP framework, we provide a comprehensive representation of nodal pressures and edge flows that incorporate higher-order interactions captured through the formalism of cell complexes. This provides a principled way to decompose the water flows in WDNs in three orthogonal signal components (irrotational, solenoidal and harmonic). The spectral representations of these components inherently reflect the conservation laws governing the water pressures and flows. Sparse representation in the spectral domain enable topology-based sampling and reconstruction of nodal pressures and water flows from sparse measurements. Our results demonstrate that employing cell complex-based signal representations enhances the accuracy of edge signal reconstruction, due to proper modeling of both conservative and non-conservative flows along the polygonal cells.

Title: Finite-Sample-Based Reachability for Safe Control with Gaussian Process Dynamics
Authors: Manish Prajapat, Johannes Köhler, Amon Lahr, Andreas Krause, Melanie N. Zeilinger
Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) regression is shown to be effective for learning unknown dynamics, enabling efficient and safety-aware control strategies across diverse applications. However, existing GP-based model predictive control (GP-MPC) methods either rely on approximations, thus lacking guarantees, or are overly conservative, which limits their practical utility. To close this gap, we present a sampling-based framework that efficiently propagates the model's epistemic uncertainty while avoiding conservatism. We establish a novel sample complexity result that enables the construction of a reachable set using a finite number of dynamics functions sampled from the GP posterior. Building on this, we design a sampling-based GP-MPC scheme that is recursively feasible and guarantees closed-loop safety and stability with high probability. Finally, we showcase the effectiveness of our method on two numerical examples, highlighting accurate reachable set over-approximation and safe closed-loop performance.

Title: Wireless Link Scheduling with State-Augmented Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Romina Garcia Camargo, Zhiyang Wang, Navid NaderiAlizadeh, Alejandro Ribeiro
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimal link scheduling in large-scale wireless ad hoc networks. We specifically aim for the maximum long-term average performance, subject to a minimum transmission requirement for each link to ensure fairness. With a graph structure utilized to represent the conflicts of links, we formulate a constrained optimization problem to learn the scheduling policy, which is parameterized with a graph neural network (GNN). To address the challenge of long-term performance, we use the state-augmentation technique. In particular, by augmenting the Lagrangian dual variables as dynamic inputs to the scheduling policy, the GNN can be trained to gradually adapt the scheduling decisions to achieve the minimum transmission requirements. We verify the efficacy of our proposed policy through numerical simulations and compare its performance with several baselines in various network settings.

Title: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Energy-Efficient Industrial Control
Authors: Georg Schäfer, Raphael Seliger, Jakob Rehrl, Stefan Huber, Simon Hirlaender
Abstract: Industrial automation increasingly demands energy-efficient control strategies to balance performance with environmental and cost constraints. In this work, we present a multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) framework for energy-efficient control of the Quanser Aero 2 testbed in its one-degree-of-freedom configuration. We design a composite reward function that simultaneously penalizes tracking error and electrical power consumption. Preliminary experiments explore the influence of varying the Energy penalty weight, alpha, on the trade-off between pitch tracking and energy savings. Our results reveal a marked performance shift for alpha values between 0.0 and 0.25, with non-Pareto optimal solutions emerging at lower alpha values, on both the simulation and the real system. We hypothesize that these effects may be attributed to artifacts introduced by the adaptive behavior of the Adam optimizer, which could bias the learning process and favor bang-bang control strategies. Future work will focus on automating alpha selection through Gaussian Process-based Pareto front modeling and transitioning the approach from simulation to real-world deployment.

Title: TACOS: Temporally-aligned Audio CaptiOnS for Language-Audio Pretraining
Authors: Paul Primus, Florian Schmid, Gerhard Widmer
Abstract: Learning to associate audio with textual descriptions is valuable for a range of tasks, including pretraining, zero-shot classification, audio retrieval, audio captioning, and text-conditioned audio generation. Existing contrastive language-audio pretrained models are typically trained using global, clip-level descriptions, which provide only weak temporal supervision. We hypothesize that CLAP-like language-audio models - particularly, if they are expected to produce frame-level embeddings - can benefit from a stronger temporal supervision. To confirm our hypothesis, we curate a novel dataset of approximately 12,000 audio recordings from Freesound, each annotated with single-sentence free-text descriptions linked to a specific temporal segment in an audio recording. We use large language models to clean these annotations by removing references to non-audible events, transcribed speech, typos, and annotator language bias. We further propose a frame-wise contrastive training strategy that learns to align text descriptions with temporal regions in an audio recording and demonstrate that our model has better temporal text-audio alignment abilities compared to models trained only on global captions when evaluated on the AudioSet Strong benchmark. The dataset and our source code are available on Zenodo and GitHub, respectively.

Title: Diffused Responsibility: Analyzing the Energy Consumption of Generative Text-to-Audio Diffusion Models
Authors: Riccardo Passoni, Francesca Ronchini, Luca Comanducci, Romain Serizel, Fabio Antonacci
Abstract: Text-to-audio models have recently emerged as a powerful technology for generating sound from textual descriptions. However, their high computational demands raise concerns about energy consumption and environmental impact. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of the energy usage of 7 state-of-the-art text-to-audio diffusion-based generative models, evaluating to what extent variations in generation parameters affect energy consumption at inference time. We also aim to identify an optimal balance between audio quality and energy consumption by considering Pareto-optimal solutions across all selected models. Our findings provide insights into the trade-offs between performance and environmental impact, contributing to the development of more efficient generative audio models.

Title: Is MixIT Really Unsuitable for Correlated Sources? Exploring MixIT for Unsupervised Pre-training in Music Source Separation
Authors: Kohei Saijo, Yoshiaki Bando
Abstract: In music source separation (MSS), obtaining isolated sources or stems is highly costly, making pre-training on unlabeled data a promising approach. Although source-agnostic unsupervised learning like mixture-invariant training (MixIT) has been explored in general sound separation, they have been largely overlooked in MSS due to its implicit assumption of source independence. We hypothesize, however, that the difficulty of applying MixIT to MSS arises from the ill-posed nature of MSS itself, where stem definitions are application-dependent and models lack explicit knowledge of what should or should not be separated, rather than from high inter-source correlation. While MixIT does not assume any source model and struggles with such ambiguities, our preliminary experiments show that it can still separate instruments to some extent, suggesting its potential for unsupervised pre-training. Motivated by these insights, this study investigates MixIT-based pre-training for MSS. We first pre-train a model on in-the-wild, unlabeled data from the Free Music Archive using MixIT, and then fine-tune it on MUSDB18 with supervision. Using the band-split TF-Locoformer, one of the state-of-the-art MSS models, we demonstrate that MixIT-based pre-training improves the performance over training from scratch.

Title: Approximate MLE of High-Dimensional STAP Covariance Matrices with Banded & Spiked Structure -- A Convex Relaxation Approach
Authors: Shashwat Jain, Vikram Krishnamurthy, Muralidhar Rangaswamy, Sandeep Gogineni, Bosung Kang, Sean M. O'Rourke
Abstract: Estimating the clutter-plus-noise covariance matrix in high-dimensional STAP is challenging in the presence of Internal Clutter Motion (ICM) and a high noise floor. The problem becomes more difficult in low-sample regimes, where the Sample Covariance Matrix (SCM) becomes ill-conditioned. To capture the ICM and high noise floor, we model the covariance matrix using a ``Banded+Spiked'' structure. Since the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for this model is non-convex, we propose a convex relaxation which is formulated as a Frobenius norm minimization with non-smooth convex constraints enforcing banded sparsity. This relaxation serves as a provable upper bound for the non-convex likelihood maximization and extends to cases where the covariance matrix dimension exceeds the number of samples. We derive a variational inequality-based bound to assess its quality. We introduce a novel algorithm to jointly estimate the banded clutter covariance and noise power. Additionally, we establish conditions ensuring the estimated covariance matrix remains positive definite and the bandsize is accurately recovered. Numerical results using the high-fidelity RFView radar simulation environment demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a higher Signal-to-Clutter-plus-Noise Ratio (SCNR) than state-of-the-art methods, including TABASCO, Spiked Covariance Stein Shrinkage, and Diagonal Loading, particularly when the covariance matrix dimension exceeds the number of samples.

Title: Breast Cancer Classification in Deep Ultraviolet Fluorescence Images Using a Patch-Level Vision Transformer Framework
Authors: Pouya Afshin, David Helminiak, Tongtong Lu, Tina Yen, Julie M. Jorns, Mollie Patton, Bing Yu, Dong Hye Ye
Abstract: Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) aims to completely remove malignant lesions while maximizing healthy tissue preservation. Intraoperative margin assessment is essential to achieve a balance between thorough cancer resection and tissue conservation. A deep ultraviolet fluorescence scanning microscope (DUV-FSM) enables rapid acquisition of whole surface images (WSIs) for excised tissue, providing contrast between malignant and normal tissues. However, breast cancer classification with DUV WSIs is challenged by high resolutions and complex histopathological features. This study introduces a DUV WSI classification framework using a patch-level vision transformer (ViT) model, capturing local and global features. Grad-CAM++ saliency weighting highlights relevant spatial regions, enhances result interpretability, and improves diagnostic accuracy for benign and malignant tissue classification. A comprehensive 5-fold cross-validation demonstrates the proposed approach significantly outperforms conventional deep learning methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 98.33%.

Authors: Usama Shakoor, Muhammad Bilal Janjua, Muhammad Sohaib J. Solaija, Huseyin Arslan
Abstract: The rapid increase in utilization of smart home technologies has introduced new paradigms to ensure the security and privacy of inhabitants. In this study, we propose a novel approach to detect and localize physical intrusions in indoor environments. The proposed method leverages signals from access points (APs) and an anchor node (AN) to achieve accurate intrusion detection and localization. We evaluate its performance through simulations under different intruder scenarios. The proposed method achieved a high accuracy of 92% for both intrusion detection and localization. Our simulations demonstrated a low false positive rate of less than 5% and a false negative rate of around 3%, highlighting the reliability of our approach in identifying security threats while minimizing unnecessary alerts. This performance underscores the effectiveness of integrating Wi-Fi sensing with advanced signal processing techniques for enhanced smart home security.

Title: Hierarchical Sparse Attention Framework for Computationally Efficient Classification of Biological Cells
Authors: Elad Yoshai, Dana Yagoda-Aharoni, Eden Dotan, Natan T. Shaked
Abstract: We present SparseAttnNet, a new hierarchical attention-driven framework for efficient image classification that adaptively selects and processes only the most informative pixels from images. Traditional convolutional neural networks typically process the entire images regardless of information density, leading to computational inefficiency and potential focus on irrelevant features. Our approach leverages a dynamic selection mechanism that uses coarse attention distilled by fine multi-head attention from the downstream layers of the model, allowing the model to identify and extract the most salient k pixels, where k is adaptively learned during training based on loss convergence trends. Once the top-k pixels are selected, the model processes only these pixels, embedding them as words in a language model to capture their semantics, followed by multi-head attention to incorporate global context. For biological cell images, we demonstrate that SparseAttnNet can process approximately 15% of the pixels instead of the full image. Applied to cell classification tasks using white blood cells images from the following modalities: optical path difference (OPD) images from digital holography for stain-free cells, images from motion-sensitive (event) camera from stain-free cells, and brightfield microscopy images of stained cells, For all three imaging modalities, SparseAttnNet achieves competitive accuracy while drastically reducing computational requirements in terms of both parameters and floating-point operations per second, compared to traditional CNNs and Vision Transformers. Since the model focuses on biologically relevant regions, it also offers improved explainability. The adaptive and lightweight nature of SparseAttnNet makes it ideal for deployment in resource-constrained and high-throughput settings, including imaging flow cytometry.

Title: ABS-Mamba: SAM2-Driven Bidirectional Spiral Mamba Network for Medical Image Translation
Authors: Feng Yuan, Yifan Gao, Wenbin Wu, Keqing Wu, Xiaotong Guo, Jie Jiang, Xin Gao
Abstract: Accurate multi-modal medical image translation requires ha-rmonizing global anatomical semantics and local structural fidelity, a challenge complicated by intermodality information loss and structural distortion. We propose ABS-Mamba, a novel architecture integrating the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for organ-aware semantic representation, specialized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for preserving modality-specific edge and texture details, and Mamba's selective state-space modeling for efficient long- and short-range feature dependencies. Structurally, our dual-resolution framework leverages SAM2's image encoder to capture organ-scale semantics from high-resolution inputs, while a parallel CNNs branch extracts fine-grained local features. The Robust Feature Fusion Network (RFFN) integrates these epresentations, and the Bidirectional Mamba Residual Network (BMRN) models spatial dependencies using spiral scanning and bidirectional state-space dynamics. A three-stage skip fusion decoder enhances edge and texture fidelity. We employ Efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA+) fine-tuning to enable precise domain specialization while maintaining the foundational capabilities of the pre-trained components. Extensive experimental validation on the SynthRAD2023 and BraTS2019 datasets demonstrates that ABS-Mamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering high-fidelity cross-modal synthesis that preserves anatomical semantics and structural details to enhance diagnostic accuracy in clinical applications.

Title: SmartUT: Receive Beamforming for Spectral Coexistence of NGSO Satellite Systems
Authors: Almoatssimbillah Saifaldawla, Eva Lagunas, Flor Ortiz, Abuzar B. M. Adam, Symeon Chatzinotas
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate downlink co-frequency interference (CFI) mitigation in non-geostationary satellites orbits (NGSOs) co-existing systems. Traditional mitigation techniques, such as Zero-forcing (ZF), produce a null towards the direction of arrivals (DOAs) of the interfering signals, but they suffer from high computational complexity due to matrix inversions and required knowledge of the channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, adaptive beamformers, such as sample matrix inversion (SMI)-based minimum variance, provide poor performance when the available snapshots are limited. We propose a Mamba-based beamformer (MambaBF) that leverages an unsupervised deep learning (DL) approach and can be deployed on the user terminal (UT) antenna array, for assisting downlink beamforming and CFI mitigation using only a limited number of available array snapshots as input, and without CSI knowledge. Simulation results demonstrate that MambaBF consistently outperforms conventional beamforming techniques in mitigating interference and maximizing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), particularly under challenging conditions characterized by low SINR, limited snapshots, and imperfect CSI.

Title: Channel Estimation for Wideband XL-MIMO: A Constrained Deep Unrolling Approach
Authors: Peicong Zheng, Xuantao Lyu, Ye Wang, Yi Gong
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multipleoutput (XL-MIMO) enables the formation of narrow beams, effectively mitigating path loss in high-frequency communications. This capability makes the integration of wideband high-frequency communications with XL-MIMO a key enabler for future 6G networks. Realizing the full potential of such wideband XL-MIMO systems critically depends on acquiring accurate channel state information. However, this acquisition is significantly challenged by inherent wideband XLMIMO channel characteristics, including near-field propagation effects, beam split, and spatial non-stationarity. We formulate the channel estimation as a maximum a posteriori problem and propose an unrolled proximal gradient descent network. The network integrates learnable step sizes and replaces the proximal operator with a neural network to implicitly learn channel prior knowledge without requiring explicit regularization terms. To enhance the convergence behavior, we incorporated a monotonic descent constraint on the layer-wise estimation error during training. This constrained learning problem is addressed using a primal-dual training approach. Theoretical analysis is provided to characterize the duality gap and convergence behavior of the proposed method. Furthermore, simulation results are presented to validate its effectiveness, demonstrating gains in estimation accuracy over both traditional and deep learning-based methods.

Title: Non-Conservative Data-driven Safe Control Design for Nonlinear Systems with Polyhedral Safe Sets
Authors: Amir Modares, Bosen Lian, Hamidreza Modares
Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven nonlinear safe control design approach for discrete-time systems under parametric uncertainties and additive disturbances. We first characterize a new control structure from which a data-based representation of closed-loop systems is obtained. This data-based closed-loop system is composed of two parts: 1) a parametrized linear closed-loop part and a parametrized nonlinear remainder closed-loop part. We show that using the standard practice or learning a robust controller to ensure safety while treating the remaining nonlinearities as disturbances brings about significant challenges in terms of computational complexity and conservatism. To overcome these challenges, we develop a novel nonlinear safe control design approach in which the closed-loop nonlinear remainders are learned, rather than canceled, in a control-oriented fashion while preserving the computational efficiency. To this end, a primal-dual optimization framework is leveraged in which the control gains are learned to enforce the second-order optimality on the closed-loop nonlinear remainders. This allows us to account for nonlinearities in the design for the sake of safety rather than treating them as disturbances. This new controller parameterization and design approach reduces the computational complexity and the conservatism of designing a safe nonlinear controller. A simulation example is then provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed data-driven controller.

Title: When Near Becomes Far: From Rayleigh to Optimal Near-Field and Far-Field Boundaries
Authors: Sajad Daei, Gabor Fodor, Mikael Skoglund
Abstract: The transition toward 6G is pushing wireless communication into a regime where the classical plane-wave assumption no longer holds. Millimeter-wave and sub-THz frequencies shrink wavelengths to millimeters, while meter-scale arrays featuring hundreds of antenna elements dramatically enlarge the aperture. Together, these trends collapse the classical Rayleigh far-field boundary from kilometers to mere single-digit meters. Consequently, most practical 6G indoor, vehicular, and industrial deployments will inherently operate within the radiating near-field, where reliance on the plane-wave approximation leads to severe array-gain losses, degraded localization accuracy, and excessive pilot overhead. This paper re-examines the fundamental question: Where does the far-field truly begin? Rather than adopting purely geometric definitions, we introduce an application-oriented approach based on user-defined error budgets and a rigorous Fresnel-zone analysis that fully accounts for both amplitude and phase curvature. We propose three practical mismatch metrics: worst-case element mismatch, worst-case normalized mean square error, and spectral efficiency loss. For each metric, we derive a provably optimal transition distance--the minimal range beyond which mismatch permanently remains below a given tolerance--and provide closed-form solutions. Extensive numerical evaluations across diverse frequencies and antenna-array dimensions show that our proposed thresholds can exceed the Rayleigh distance by more than an order of magnitude. By transforming the near-field from a design nuisance into a precise, quantifiable tool, our results provide a clear roadmap for enabling reliable and resource-efficient near-field communications and sensing in emerging 6G systems.

Title: Extended Convex Hull-Based Distributed Optimal Energy Flow of Integrated Electricity-Gas Systems
Authors: Rong-Peng Liu, Wei Sun, Dali Zhou, Yunhe Hou
Abstract: Integrated electricity and gas systems are constructed to facilitate the gas-fired generation, and the distributed operation of these integrated systems have received much attention due to the increased emphasis on data security and privacy between different agencies. This paper proposes an extended convex hull based method to address optimal energy flow problems for the integrated electricity and gas systems in a distributed manner. First, a multi-block electricity-gas system model is constructed by dividing the whole system into N blocks considering both physical and regional differences. This multi-block model is then convexified by replacing the nonconvex gas transmission equation with the extended convex hullbased constraints. The Jacobi-Proximal alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm is adopted to solve the convexified model and minimize its operation cost. Finally, the feasibility of the optimal solution for the convexified model is checked, and a sufficient condition is developed. If the sufficient condition is satisfied, the optimal solution for the original nonconvex problem can be recovered from that for the convexified problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is tractable and effective in obtaining feasible optimal solutions for multi-block optimal energy flow problems.

Title: OpenSky Report 2025: Improving Crowdsourced Flight Trajectories with ADS-C Data
Authors: Junzi Sun, Xavier Olive, Martin Strohmeier, Vincent Lenders
Abstract: The OpenSky Network has been collecting and providing crowdsourced air traffic surveillance data since 2013. The network has primarily focused on Automatic Dependent Surveillance--Broadcast (ADS-B) data, which provides high-frequency position updates over terrestrial areas. However, the ADS-B signals are limited over oceans and remote regions, where ground-based receivers are scarce. To address these coverage gaps, the OpenSky Network has begun incorporating data from the Automatic Dependent Surveillance--Contract (ADS-C) system, which uses satellite communication to track aircraft positions over oceanic regions and remote areas. In this paper, we analyze a dataset of over 720,000 ADS-C messages collected in 2024 from around 2,600 unique aircraft via the Alphasat satellite, covering Europe, Africa, and parts of the Atlantic Ocean. We present our approach to combining ADS-B and ADS-C data to construct detailed long-haul flight paths, particularly for transatlantic and African routes. Our findings demonstrate that this integration significantly improves trajectory reconstruction accuracy, allowing for better fuel consumption and emissions estimates. We illustrate how combined data captures flight patterns across previously underrepresented regions across Africa. Despite coverage limitations, this work marks an important advancement in providing open access to global flight trajectory data, enabling new research opportunities in air traffic management, environmental impact assessment, and aviation safety.

Title: Edge-Optimized Deep Learning & Pattern Recognition Techniques for Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring of Energy Time Series
Authors: Sotirios Athanasoulias
Abstract: The growing global energy demand and the urgent need for sustainability call for innovative ways to boost energy efficiency. While advanced energy-saving systems exist, they often fall short without user engagement. Providing feedback on energy consumption behavior is key to promoting sustainable practices. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) offers a promising solution by disaggregating total household energy usage, recorded by a central smart meter, into appliance-level data. This empowers users to optimize consumption. Advances in AI, IoT, and smart meter adoption have further enhanced NILM's potential. Despite this promise, real-world NILM deployment faces major challenges. First, existing datasets mainly represent regions like the USA and UK, leaving places like the Mediterranean underrepresented. This limits understanding of regional consumption patterns, such as heavy use of air conditioners and electric water heaters. Second, deep learning models used in NILM require high computational power, often relying on cloud services. This increases costs, raises privacy concerns, and limits scalability, especially for households with poor connectivity. This thesis tackles these issues with key contributions. It presents an interoperable data collection framework and introduces the Plegma Dataset, focused on underrepresented Mediterranean energy patterns. It also explores advanced deep neural networks and model compression techniques for efficient edge deployment. By bridging theoretical advances with practical needs, this work aims to make NILM scalable, efficient, and adaptable for global energy sustainability.

Title: Prompting Large Language Models for Training-Free Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring
Authors: Junyu Xue, Xudong Wang, Xiaoling He, Shicheng Liu, Yi Wang, Guoming Tang
Abstract: Non-intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) aims to disaggregate aggregate household electricity consumption into individual appliance usage, enabling more effective energy management. While deep learning has advanced NILM, it remains limited by its dependence on labeled data, restricted generalization, and lack of interpretability. In this paper, we introduce the first prompt-based NILM framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) with in-context learning. We design and evaluate prompt strategies that integrate appliance features, timestamps and contextual information, as well as representative time-series examples, using the REDD dataset. With optimized prompts, LLMs achieve competitive state detection accuracy, reaching an average F1-score of 0.676 on unseen households, and demonstrate robust generalization without the need for fine-tuning. LLMs also enhance interpretability by providing clear, human-readable explanations for their predictions. Our results show that LLMs can reduce data requirements, improve adaptability, and provide transparent energy disaggregation in NILM applications.

Title: A Comprehensive Data Description for LoRaWAN Path Loss Measurements in an Indoor Office Setting: Effects of Environmental Factors
Authors: Nahshon Mokua Obiri, Kristof Van Laerhoven
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive dataset of LoRaWAN technology path loss measurements collected in an indoor office environment, focusing on quantifying the effects of environmental factors on signal propagation. Utilizing a network of six strategically placed LoRaWAN end devices (EDs) and a single indoor gateway (GW) at the University of Siegen, City of Siegen, Germany, we systematically measured signal strength indicators such as the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) under various environmental conditions, including temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) concentration, barometric pressure, and particulate matter levels (PM$_{2.5}$). Our empirical analysis confirms that transient phenomena such as reflections, scattering, interference, occupancy patterns (induced by environmental parameter variations), and furniture rearrangements can alter signal attenuation by as much as 10.58 dB, highlighting the dynamic nature of indoor propagation. As an example of how this dataset can be utilized, we tested and evaluated a refined Log-Distance Path Loss and Shadowing Model that integrates both structural obstructions (Multiple Walls) and Environmental Parameters (LDPLSM-MW-EP). Compared to a baseline model that considers only Multiple Walls (LDPLSM-MW), the enhanced approach reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) from 10.58 dB to 8.04 dB and increased the coefficient of determination (R$^2$) from 0.6917 to 0.8222. By capturing the extra effects of environmental conditions and occupancy dynamics, this improved model provides valuable insights for optimizing power usage and prolonging device battery life, enhancing network reliability in indoor Internet of Things (IoT) deployments, among other applications. This dataset offers a solid foundation for future research and development in indoor wireless communication.

Title: Engineering Risk-Aware, Security-by-Design Frameworks for Assurance of Large-Scale Autonomous AI Models
Authors: Krti Tallam
Abstract: As AI models scale to billions of parameters and operate with increasing autonomy, ensuring their safe, reliable operation demands engineering-grade security and assurance frameworks. This paper presents an enterprise-level, risk-aware, security-by-design approach for large-scale autonomous AI systems, integrating standardized threat metrics, adversarial hardening techniques, and real-time anomaly detection into every phase of the development lifecycle. We detail a unified pipeline - from design-time risk assessments and secure training protocols to continuous monitoring and automated audit logging - that delivers provable guarantees of model behavior under adversarial and operational stress. Case studies in national security, open-source model governance, and industrial automation demonstrate measurable reductions in vulnerability and compliance overhead. Finally, we advocate cross-sector collaboration - uniting engineering teams, standards bodies, and regulatory agencies - to institutionalize these technical safeguards within a resilient, end-to-end assurance ecosystem for the next generation of AI.

Title: Autonomous Vision-Based Magnetic Microrobotic Pushing of Micro-Objects and Cells
Authors: Max Sokolich, Ceren Kirmizitas, Sambeeta Das, Ron Weiss
Abstract: Accurate and autonomous transportation of micro-objects and biological cells can enable significant advances in a wide variety of research disciplines. Here, we present a novel, vision-based, model-free microrobotic pushing algorithm for the autonomous manipulation of micro objects and biological cells. The algorithm adjusts the axis of a rotating magnetic field that in turn controls the heading angle and spin axis of a spherical Janus rolling microrobot. We introduce the concept of a microrobotic guiding corridor to constrain the object and to avoid pushing failures. We then show that employing only two simple conditions, the microrobot is able to successfully and autonomously push microscale objects along predefined trajectories. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm by measuring the mean absolute error and completion time relative to a desired path at different actuation frequencies and guiding corridor widths. Finally, we demonstrate biomedical applicability by autonomously transporting a single biological cell, highlighting the methods potential for applications in tissue engineering, drug delivery and synthetic biology.

Title: On the Existence of Lagrange Multipliers in Distribution Network Reconfiguration Problems
Authors: Rong-Peng Liu, Yue Song, Xiaozhe Wang, Bo Zeng
Abstract: Distribution network reconfiguration (DNR) is an effective approach for optimizing distribution network operation. However, the DNR problem is computationally challenging due to the mixed-integer non-convex nature. One feasible approach for addressing this challenge is to reformulate binary line on/off state variables as (continuous) non-convex constraints, leading to a nonconvex program. Unfortunately, it remains unclear whether this formulation satisfies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions at locally optimal solutions. In this brief, we study the existence of Lagrange multipliers in DNR problems and prove that under mild assumptions, Lagrange multipliers exist for the DNR model at every locally optimal solution almost surely such that the KKT conditions hold.

Title: Emergent Multi-View Fidelity in Autonomous UAV Swarm Sport Injury Detection
Authors: Yu Cheng, Harun Šiljak
Abstract: Accurate, real-time collision detection is essential for ensuring player safety and effective refereeing in high-contact sports such as rugby, particularly given the severe risks associated with traumatic brain injuries (TBI). Traditional collision-monitoring methods employing fixed cameras or wearable sensors face limitations in visibility, coverage, and responsiveness. Previously, we introduced a framework using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for monitoring and real time kinematics extraction from videos of collision events. In this paper, we show that the strategies operating on the objective of ensuring at least one UAV captures every incident on the pitch have an emergent property of fulfilling a stronger key condition for successful kinematics extraction. Namely, they ensure that almost all collisions are captured by multiple drones, establishing multi-view fidelity and redundancy, while not requiring any drone-to-drone communication.

Title: TS-SUPERB: A Target Speech Processing Benchmark for Speech Self-Supervised Learning Models
Authors: Junyi Peng, Takanori Ashihara, Marc Delcroix, Tsubasa Ochiai, Oldrich Plchot, Shoko Araki, Jan Černocký
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) models have significantly advanced speech processing tasks, and several benchmarks have been proposed to validate their effectiveness. However, previous benchmarks have primarily focused on single-speaker scenarios, with less exploration of target-speaker tasks in noisy, multi-talker conditions -- a more challenging yet practical case. In this paper, we introduce the Target-Speaker Speech Processing Universal Performance Benchmark (TS-SUPERB), which includes four widely recognized target-speaker processing tasks that require identifying the target speaker and extracting information from the speech mixture. In our benchmark, the speaker embedding extracted from enrollment speech is used as a clue to condition downstream models. The benchmark result reveals the importance of evaluating SSL models in target speaker scenarios, demonstrating that performance cannot be easily inferred from related single-speaker tasks. Moreover, by using a unified SSL-based target speech encoder, consisting of a speaker encoder and an extractor module, we also investigate joint optimization across TS tasks to leverage mutual information and demonstrate its effectiveness.

Title: StableMotion: Repurposing Diffusion-Based Image Priors for Motion Estimation
Authors: Ziyi Wang, Haipeng Li, Lin Sui, Tianhao Zhou, Hai Jiang, Lang Nie, Shuaicheng Liu
Abstract: We present StableMotion, a novel framework leverages knowledge (geometry and content priors) from pretrained large-scale image diffusion models to perform motion estimation, solving single-image-based image rectification tasks such as Stitched Image Rectangling (SIR) and Rolling Shutter Correction (RSC). Specifically, StableMotion framework takes text-to-image Stable Diffusion (SD) models as backbone and repurposes it into an image-to-motion estimator. To mitigate inconsistent output produced by diffusion models, we propose Adaptive Ensemble Strategy (AES) that consolidates multiple outputs into a cohesive, high-fidelity result. Additionally, we present the concept of Sampling Steps Disaster (SSD), the counterintuitive scenario where increasing the number of sampling steps can lead to poorer outcomes, which enables our framework to achieve one-step inference. StableMotion is verified on two image rectification tasks and delivers state-of-the-art performance in both, as well as showing strong generalizability. Supported by SSD, StableMotion offers a speedup of 200 times compared to previous diffusion model-based methods.

Title: Dynamic feedback linearization of two-input control systems via successive one-fold prolongations
Authors: Florentina Nicolau, Witold Respondek, Shunjie Li
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a constructive algorithm to dynamically linearize two-input control systems via successive one-fold prolongations of a control that has to be suitably chosen at each step of the algorithm. Linearization via successive one-fold prolongations requires special properties of the linearizability distributions $\mathcal{D}^0 \subset \mathcal{D}^1 \subset\mathcal{D}^2 \subset \cdots$. Contrary to the case of static feedback linearizability, they need not be involutive but the first noninvolutive one has to contain an involutive subdistribution of corank one. The main idea of the proposed algorithm is to replace, at each step, the first noninvolutive distribution by its involutive subdistribution of corank one, thus for the prolonged system we gain at least one new involutive distribution. Our algorithm is constructive, gives sufficient conditions for flatness, and can be seen as the dual of the dynamic feedback linearization algorithm of Battilotti and Califano [2003, 2005].

Title: Distributionally Robust Contract Theory for Edge AIGC Services in Teleoperation
Authors: Zijun Zhan, Yaxian Dong, Daniel Mawunyo Doe, Yuqing Hu, Shuai Li, Shaohua Cao, Lei Fan, Zhu Han
Abstract: Advanced AI-Generated Content (AIGC) technologies have injected new impetus into teleoperation, further enhancing its security and efficiency. Edge AIGC networks have been introduced to meet the stringent low-latency requirements of teleoperation. However, the inherent uncertainty of AIGC service quality and the need to incentivize AIGC service providers (ASPs) make the design of a robust incentive mechanism essential. This design is particularly challenging due to both uncertainty and information asymmetry, as teleoperators have limited knowledge of the remaining resource capacities of ASPs. To this end, we propose a distributionally robust optimization (DRO)-based contract theory to design robust reward schemes for AIGC task offloading. Notably, our work extends the contract theory by integrating DRO, addressing the fundamental challenge of contract design under uncertainty. In this paper, contract theory is employed to model the information asymmetry, while DRO is utilized to capture the uncertainty in AIGC service quality. Given the inherent complexity of the original DRO-based contract theory problem, we reformulate it into an equivalent, tractable bi-level optimization problem. To efficiently solve this problem, we develop a Block Coordinate Descent (BCD)-based algorithm to derive robust reward schemes. Simulation results on our unity-based teleoperation platform demonstrate that the proposed method improves teleoperator utility by 2.7\% to 10.74\% under varying degrees of AIGC service quality shifts and increases ASP utility by 60.02\% compared to the SOTA method, i.e., Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based contract theory. The code and data are publicly available at this https URL.

Title: A Survey on Data-Driven Modeling of Human Drivers' Lane-Changing Decisions
Authors: Linxuan Huang, Dong-Fan Xie, Li Li, Zhengbing He
Abstract: Lane-changing (LC) behavior, a critical yet complex driving maneuver, significantly influences driving safety and traffic dynamics. Traditional analytical LC decision (LCD) models, while effective in specific environments, often oversimplify behavioral heterogeneity and complex interactions, limiting their capacity to capture real LCD. Data-driven approaches address these gaps by leveraging rich empirical data and machine learning to decode latent decision-making patterns, enabling adaptive LCD modeling in dynamic environments. In light of the rapid development of artificial intelligence and the demand for data-driven models oriented towards connected vehicles and autonomous vehicles, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of data-driven LCD models, with a particular focus on human drivers LC decision-making. It systematically reviews the modeling framework, covering data sources and preprocessing, model inputs and outputs, objectives, structures, and validation methods. This survey further discusses the opportunities and challenges faced by data-driven LCD models, including driving safety, uncertainty, as well as the integration and improvement of technical frameworks.

Title: Distributed Event-Triggered Nash Equilibrium Seeking for Noncooperative Games
Authors: Victor Hugo Pereira Rodrigues, Tiago Roux Oliveira, Miroslav Krstic, Tamer Basar
Abstract: We propose locally convergent Nash equilibrium seeking algorithms for $N$-player noncooperative games, which use distributed event-triggered pseudo-gradient estimates. The proposed approach employs sinusoidal perturbations to estimate the pseudo-gradients of unknown quadratic payoff functions. This is the first instance of noncooperative games being tackled in a model-free fashion with event-triggered extremum seeking. Each player evaluates independently the deviation between the corresponding current pseudo-gradient estimate and its last broadcasted value from the event-triggering mechanism to tune individually the player action, while they preserve collectively the closed-loop stability/convergence. We guarantee Zeno behavior avoidance by establishing a minimum dwell-time to avoid infinitely fast switching. In particular, the stability analysis is carried out using Lyapunov's method and averaging for systems with discontinuous right-hand sides. We quantify the size of the ultimate small residual sets around the Nash equilibrium and illustrate the theoretical results numerically on an oligopoly setting.

Title: Improving 5G/B5G Network Performance with RFID-Enabled Resource Management Systems
Authors: Stella N. Arinze, Halima I. Kure, Augustine O. Nwajana
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of 5G and B5G (beyond 5G) networks, efficient resource optimization is critical to addressing the escalating demands for high-speed, low-latency, and energy efficient communication. This study explores the integration of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology as a novel approach to enhance resource management in 5G/B5G networks. The motivation behind this research lies in overcoming persistent challenges such as spectrum congestion, high latency, and inefficient load balancing, which impede the performance of traditional resource allocation methods. To achieve this, RFID tags were embedded in critical network components, including user devices, base stations, and Internet of Things (IoT) nodes, enabling the collection of real-time data on device status, location, and resource utilization. RFID readers strategically placed across the network continuously captured this data, which was processed by a centralized controller using a custom-designed optimization algorithm. This algorithm dynamically managed key network resources, including spectrum allocation, load balancing, and energy consumption, ensuring efficient operation under varying network conditions. Simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of the RFID-based model against traditional 4G dynamic resource allocation techniques. The results demonstrated substantial improvements in key performance metrics.

Title: Beyond Identity: A Generalizable Approach for Deepfake Audio Detection
Authors: Yasaman Ahmadiadli, Xiao-Ping Zhang, Naimul Khan
Abstract: Deepfake audio presents a growing threat to digital security, due to its potential for social engineering, fraud, and identity misuse. However, existing detection models suffer from poor generalization across datasets, due to implicit identity leakage, where models inadvertently learn speaker-specific features instead of manipulation artifacts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explicitly analyze and address identity leakage in the audio deepfake detection domain. This work proposes an identity-independent audio deepfake detection framework that mitigates identity leakage by encouraging the model to focus on forgery-specific artifacts instead of overfitting to speaker traits. Our approach leverages Artifact Detection Modules (ADMs) to isolate synthetic artifacts in both time and frequency domains, enhancing cross-dataset generalization. We introduce novel dynamic artifact generation techniques, including frequency domain swaps, time domain manipulations, and background noise augmentation, to enforce learning of dataset-invariant features. Extensive experiments conducted on ASVspoof2019, ADD 2022, FoR, and In-The-Wild datasets demonstrate that the proposed ADM-enhanced models achieve F1 scores of 0.230 (ADD 2022), 0.604 (FoR), and 0.813 (In-The-Wild), consistently outperforming the baseline. Dynamic Frequency Swap proves to be the most effective strategy across diverse conditions. These findings emphasize the value of artifact-based learning in mitigating implicit identity leakage for more generalizable audio deepfake detection.

Title: Digital-physical testbed for ship autonomy studies in the Marine Cybernetics Laboratory basin
Authors: Emir Cem Gezer, Mael Korentin Ivan Moreau, Anders Sandneseng Høgden, Dong Trong Nguyen, Roger Skjetne, Asgeir Sørensen
Abstract: The algorithms developed for Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) are often challenging to test on actual vessels due to high operational costs and safety considerations. Simulations offer a cost-effective alternative and eliminate risks, but they may not accurately represent real-world dynamics for the given tasks. Utilizing small-scale model ships and robotic vessels in conjunction with a laboratory basin provides an accessible testing environment for the early stages of validation processes. However, designing and developing a model vessel for a single test can be costly and cumbersome, and often researchers lack availability to such infrastructure. To address these challenges and enable streamlined testing, we have developed an in-house testbed that facilitates the development, testing, verification, and validation of MASS algorithms in a digital-physical laboratory. This infrastructure includes a set of small-scale model vessels, a simulation environment for each vessel, a comprehensive testbed environment, and a digital twin in Unity. With this, we aim to establish a full design and verification pipeline that starts with high-fidelity simulation models of each model vessel, to the model-scale testing in the laboratory basin, allowing possibilities for moving to semi-fullscale validation with the R/V milliAmpere 1 passenger ferry and full-scale validation using the R/V Gunnerus. In this work, we present our progress on the development of this testbed environment and its components, demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling ship guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) including autonomy.

Title: Dynamic Safety in Complex Environments: Synthesizing Safety Filters with Poisson's Equation
Authors: Gilbert Bahati, Ryan M. Bena, Aaron D. Ames
Abstract: Synthesizing safe sets for robotic systems operating in complex and dynamically changing environments is a challenging problem. Solving this problem can enable the construction of safety filters that guarantee safe control actions -- most notably by employing Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). This paper presents an algorithm for generating safe sets from perception data by leveraging elliptic partial differential equations, specifically Poisson's equation. Given a local occupancy map, we solve Poisson's equation subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions, with a novel forcing function. Specifically, we design a smooth guidance vector field, which encodes gradient information required for safety. The result is a variational problem for which the unique minimizer -- a safety function -- characterizes the safe set. After establishing our theoretical result, we illustrate how safety functions can be used in CBF-based safety filtering. The real-time utility of our synthesis method is highlighted through hardware demonstrations on quadruped and humanoid robots navigating dynamically changing obstacle-filled environments.

Title: Bridging Ears and Eyes: Analyzing Audio and Visual Large Language Models to Humans in Visible Sound Recognition and Reducing Their Sensory Gap via Cross-Modal Distillation
Authors: Xilin Jiang, Junkai Wu, Vishal Choudhari, Nima Mesgarani
Abstract: Audio large language models (LLMs) are considered experts at recognizing sound objects, yet their performance relative to LLMs in other sensory modalities, such as visual or audio-visual LLMs, and to humans using their ears, eyes, or both remains unexplored. To investigate this, we systematically evaluate audio, visual, and audio-visual LLMs, specifically Qwen2-Audio, Qwen2-VL, and Qwen2.5-Omni, against humans in recognizing sound objects of different classes from audio-only, silent video, or sounded video inputs. We uncover a performance gap between Qwen2-Audio and Qwen2-VL that parallels the sensory discrepancy between human ears and eyes. To reduce this gap, we introduce a cross-modal distillation framework, where an LLM in one modality serves as the teacher and another as the student, with knowledge transfer in sound classes predicted as more challenging to the student by a heuristic model. Distillation in both directions, from Qwen2-VL to Qwen2-Audio and vice versa, leads to notable improvements, particularly in challenging classes. This work highlights the sensory gap in LLMs from a human-aligned perspective and proposes a principled approach to enhancing modality-specific perception in multimodal LLMs.

Title: Secure Safety Filter: Towards Safe Flight Control under Sensor Attacks
Authors: Xiao Tan, Junior Sundar, Renzo Bruzzone, Pio Ong, Willian T. Lunardi, Martin Andreoni, Paulo Tabuada, Aaron D. Ames
Abstract: Modern autopilot systems are prone to sensor attacks that can jeopardize flight safety. To mitigate this risk, we proposed a modular solution: the secure safety filter, which extends the well-established control barrier function (CBF)-based safety filter to account for, and mitigate, sensor attacks. This module consists of a secure state reconstructor (which generates plausible states) and a safety filter (which computes the safe control input that is closest to the nominal one). Differing from existing work focusing on linear, noise-free systems, the proposed secure safety filter handles bounded measurement noise and, by leveraging reduced-order model techniques, is applicable to the nonlinear dynamics of drones. Software-in-the-loop simulations and drone hardware experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the secure safety filter in rendering the system safe in the presence of sensor attacks.

Title: Rate-Matching Deep Polar Codes via Polar Coded Extension
Authors: Geon Choi, Namyoon Lee
Abstract: Deep polar codes are pre-transformed polar codes that employ a multi-layered polar kernel transformation strategy to enhance code performance in short blocklength regimes. However, like conventional polar codes, their block length is constrained to powers of two, as the final transformation layer uses a conventional polar kernel matrix. This paper introduces a novel rate-matching technique for deep polar codes using code extension, particularly effective when the desired code length slightly exceeds a power of two. The key idea is to exploit the layered structure of deep polar codes by concatenating polar codewords generated at each transformation layer. Based on this structure, we also develop an efficient decoding algorithm leveraging soft-output successive cancellation list decoding and provide comprehensive error probability analysis supporting our code design algorithms. Additionally, we propose a computationally efficient greedy algorithm for multi-layer configurations. Extensive simulations confirm that our approach delivers substantial coding gains over conventional rate-matching methods, especially in medium to high code-rate regimes.

Title: Image Classification Using a Diffusion Model as a Pre-Training Model
Authors: Kosuke Ukita, Ye Xiaolong, Tsuyoshi Okita
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a diffusion model that integrates a representation-conditioning mechanism, where the representations derived from a Vision Transformer (ViT) are used to condition the internal process of a Transformer-based diffusion model. This approach enables representation-conditioned data generation, addressing the challenge of requiring large-scale labeled datasets by leveraging self-supervised learning on unlabeled data. We evaluate our method through a zero-shot classification task for hematoma detection in brain imaging. Compared to the strong contrastive learning baseline, DINOv2, our method achieves a notable improvement of +6.15% in accuracy and +13.60% in F1-score, demonstrating its effectiveness in image classification.

Title: Enhancing Monocular Height Estimation via Sparse LiDAR-Guided Correction
Authors: Jian Song, Hongruixuan Chen, Naoto Yokoya
Abstract: Monocular height estimation (MHE) from very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery via deep learning is notoriously challenging due to the lack of sufficient structural information. Conventional digital elevation models (DEMs), typically derived from airborne LiDAR or multi-view stereo, remain costly and geographically limited. Recently, models trained on synthetic data and refined through domain adaptation have shown remarkable performance in MHE, yet it remains unclear how these models make predictions or how reliable they truly are. In this paper, we investigate a state-of-the-art MHE model trained purely on synthetic data to explore where the model looks when making height predictions. Through systematic analyses, we find that the model relies heavily on shadow cues, a factor that can lead to overestimation or underestimation of heights when shadows deviate from expected norms. Furthermore, the inherent difficulty of evaluating regression tasks with the human eye underscores additional limitations of purely synthetic training. To address these issues, we propose a novel correction pipeline that integrates sparse, imperfect global LiDAR measurements (ICESat-2) with deep-learning outputs to improve local accuracy and achieve spatially consistent corrections. Our method comprises two stages: pre-processing raw ICESat-2 data, followed by a random forest-based approach to densely refine height estimates. Experiments in three representative urban regions -- Saint-Omer, Tokyo, and Sao Paulo -- reveal substantial error reductions, with mean absolute error (MAE) decreased by 22.8\%, 6.9\%, and 4.9\%, respectively. These findings highlight the critical role of shadow awareness in synthetic data-driven models and demonstrate how fusing imperfect real-world LiDAR data can bolster the robustness of MHE, paving the way for more reliable and scalable 3D mapping solutions.

Title: Realistic Counterfactual Explanations for Machine Learning-Controlled Mobile Robots using 2D LiDAR
Authors: Sindre Benjamin Remman, Anastasios M. Lekkas
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for generating realistic counterfactual explanations (CFEs) in machine learning (ML)-based control for mobile robots using 2D LiDAR. ML models, especially artificial neural networks (ANNs), can provide advanced decision-making and control capabilities by learning from data. However, they often function as black boxes, making it challenging to interpret them. This is especially a problem in safety-critical control applications. To generate realistic CFEs, we parameterize the LiDAR space with simple shapes such as circles and rectangles, whose parameters are chosen by a genetic algorithm, and the configurations are transformed into LiDAR data by raycasting. Our model-agnostic approach generates CFEs in the form of synthetic LiDAR data that resembles a base LiDAR state but is modified to produce a pre-defined ML model control output based on a query from the user. We demonstrate our method on a mobile robot, the TurtleBot3, controlled using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in real-world and simulated scenarios. Our method generates logical and realistic CFEs, which helps to interpret the DRL agent's decision making. This paper contributes towards advancing explainable AI in mobile robotics, and our method could be a tool for understanding, debugging, and improving ML-based autonomous control.

Title: Efficient Fault Detection in WSN Based on PCA-Optimized Deep Neural Network Slicing Trained with GOA
Authors: Mahmood Mohassel Feghhi, Raya Majid Alsharfa, Majid Hameed Majeed
Abstract: Fault detection in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is crucial for reliable data transmission and network longevity. Traditional fault detection methods often struggle with optimizing deep neural networks (DNNs) for efficient performance, especially in handling high-dimensional data and capturing nonlinear relationships. Additionally, these methods typically suffer from slow convergence and difficulty in finding optimal network architectures using gradient-based optimization. This study proposes a novel hybrid method combining Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with a DNN optimized by the Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) to address these limitations. Our approach begins by computing eigenvalues from the original 12-dimensional dataset and sorting them in descending order. The cumulative sum of these values is calculated, retaining principal components until 99.5% variance is achieved, effectively reducing dimensionality to 4 features while preserving critical information. This compressed representation trains a six-layer DNN where GOA optimizes the network architecture, overcoming backpropagation's limitations in discovering nonlinear relationships. This hybrid PCA-GOA-DNN framework compresses the data and trains a six-layer DNN that is optimized by GOA, enhancing both training efficiency and fault detection accuracy. The dataset used in this study is a real-world WSNs dataset developed by the University of North Carolina, which was used to evaluate the proposed method's performance. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our approach achieves a remarkable 99.72% classification accuracy, with exceptional precision and recall, outperforming conventional methods. The method is computationally efficient, making it suitable for large-scale WSN deployments, and represents a significant advancement in fault detection for resource-constrained WSNs.

Title: Robust Movable-Antenna Position Optimization with Imperfect CSI for MISO Systems
Authors: Haifeng Ma, Weidong Mei, Xin Wei, Boyu Ning, Zhi Chen
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) technology has emerged as a promising solution for reconfiguring wireless channel conditions through local antenna movement within confined regions. Unlike previous works assuming perfect channel state information (CSI), this letter addresses the robust MA position optimization problem under imperfect CSI conditions for a multiple-input single-output (MISO) MA system. Specifically, we consider two types of CSI errors: norm-bounded and randomly distributed errors, aiming to maximize the worst-case and non-outage received signal power, respectively. For norm-bounded CSI errors, we derive the worst-case received signal power in closed-form. For randomly distributed CSI errors, due to the intractability of the probabilistic constraints, we apply the Bernstein-type inequality to obtain a closed-form lower bound for the non-outage received signal power. Based on these results, we show the optimality of the maximum-ratio transmission for imperfect CSI in both scenarios and employ a graph-based algorithm to obtain the optimal MA positions. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme can even outperform other benchmark schemes implemented under perfect CSI conditions.

Title: AI-Driven Optimization of Wave-Controlled Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces
Authors: Gal Ben Itzhak, Miguel Saavedra-Melo, Ender Ayanoglu, Filippo Capolino, A. Lee Swindlehurst
Abstract: A promising type of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) employs tunable control of its varactors using biasing transmission lines below the RIS reflecting elements. Biasing standing waves (BSWs) are excited by a time-periodic signal and sampled at each RIS element to create a desired biasing voltage and control the reflection coefficients of the elements. A simple rectifier can be used to sample the voltages and capture the peaks of the BSWs over time. Like other types of RIS, attempting to model and accurately configure a wave-controlled RIS is extremely challenging due to factors such as device non-linearities, frequency dependence, element coupling, etc., and thus significant differences will arise between the actual and assumed performance. An alternative approach to solving this problem is data-driven: Using training data obtained by sampling the reflected radiation pattern of the RIS for a set of BSWs, a neural network (NN) is designed to create an input-output map between the BSW amplitudes and the resulting sampled radiation pattern. This is the approach discussed in this paper. In the proposed approach, the NN is optimized using a genetic algorithm (GA) to minimize the error between the predicted and measured radiation patterns. The BSW amplitudes are then designed via Simulated Annealing (SA) to optimize a signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio measure by iteratively forward-propagating the BSW amplitudes through the NN and using its output as feedback to determine convergence. The resulting optimal solutions are stored in a lookup table to be used both as settings to instantly configure the RIS and as a basis for determining more complex radiation patterns.

Title: On the Cost and Benefits of Training Context with Utterance or Full Conversation Training: A Comparative Stud
Authors: Hyouin Liu, Zhikuan Zhang
Abstract: Modern TTS systems designed for conversations achieve high-quality utterances but often remain inaccessible publicly. Are existing open-source architectures inadequate, or are current training techniques insufficient? This paper investigates prominent models and their underlying behaviors regarding conversational context. Using 20 GPU-hours on an NVIDIA H100, we empirically examine two approaches: context-based utterance-level training versus full conversation training. Results demonstrate that context-based utterance training achieves superior MOS scores (4.3/5.0 vs 3.7/5.0) and reduces training time by 37%, while full conversation approaches suffer from speaker similarity hallucination issues. These findings provide practical guidelines for conversational TTS development, favoring utterance-level training with contextual conditioning for both resource efficiency and output quality.

Title: Language-Driven Dual Style Mixing for Single-Domain Generalized Object Detection
Authors: Hongda Qin, Xiao Lu, Zhiyong Wei, Yihong Cao, Kailun Yang, Ningjiang Chen
Abstract: Generalizing an object detector trained on a single domain to multiple unseen domains is a challenging task. Existing methods typically introduce image or feature augmentation to diversify the source domain to raise the robustness of the detector. Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based augmentation techniques have been proven to be effective, but they require that the detector's backbone has the same structure as the image encoder of VLM, limiting the detector framework selection. To address this problem, we propose Language-Driven Dual Style Mixing (LDDS) for single-domain generalization, which diversifies the source domain by fully utilizing the semantic information of the VLM. Specifically, we first construct prompts to transfer style semantics embedded in the VLM to an image translation network. This facilitates the generation of style diversified images with explicit semantic information. Then, we propose image-level style mixing between the diversified images and source domain images. This effectively mines the semantic information for image augmentation without relying on specific augmentation selections. Finally, we propose feature-level style mixing in a double-pipeline manner, allowing feature augmentation to be model-agnostic and can work seamlessly with the mainstream detector frameworks, including the one-stage, two-stage, and transformer-based detectors. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across various benchmark datasets, including real to cartoon and normal to adverse weather tasks. The source code and pre-trained models will be publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Multi-band Frequency Reconstruction for Neural Psychoacoustic Coding
Authors: Dianwen Ng, Kun Zhou, Yi-Wen Chao, Zhiwei Xiong, Bin Ma, Eng Siong Chng
Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity audio compression while preserving perceptual quality across diverse content remains a key challenge in Neural Audio Coding (NAC). We introduce MUFFIN, a fully convolutional Neural Psychoacoustic Coding (NPC) framework that leverages psychoacoustically guided multi-band frequency reconstruction. At its core is a Multi-Band Spectral Residual Vector Quantization (MBS-RVQ) module that allocates bitrate across frequency bands based on perceptual salience. This design enables efficient compression while disentangling speaker identity from content using distinct codebooks. MUFFIN incorporates a transformer-inspired convolutional backbone and a modified snake activation to enhance resolution in fine-grained spectral regions. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MUFFIN consistently outperforms existing approaches in reconstruction quality. A high-compression variant achieves a state-of-the-art 12.5 Hz rate with minimal loss. MUFFIN also proves effective in downstream generative tasks, highlighting its promise as a token representation for integration with language models. Audio samples and code are available.

Title: ALPCAH: Subspace Learning for Sample-wise Heteroscedastic Data
Authors: Javier Salazar Cavazos, Jeffrey A. Fessler, Laura Balzano
Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a key tool in the field of data dimensionality reduction. However, some applications involve heterogeneous data that vary in quality due to noise characteristics associated with each data sample. Heteroscedastic methods aim to deal with such mixed data quality. This paper develops a subspace learning method, named ALPCAH, that can estimate the sample-wise noise variances and use this information to improve the estimate of the subspace basis associated with the low-rank structure of the data. Our method makes no distributional assumptions of the low-rank component and does not assume that the noise variances are known. Further, this method uses a soft rank constraint that does not require subspace dimension to be known. Additionally, this paper develops a matrix factorized version of ALPCAH, named LR-ALPCAH, that is much faster and more memory efficient at the cost of requiring subspace dimension to be known or estimated. Simulations and real data experiments show the effectiveness of accounting for data heteroscedasticity compared to existing algorithms. Code available at this https URL.

Title: Learning Quasi-LPV Models and Robust Control Invariant Sets with Reduced Conservativeness
Authors: Sampath Kumar Mulagaleti, Alberto Bemporad
Abstract: We present an approach to identify a quasi Linear Parameter Varying (qLPV) model of a plant, with the qLPV model guaranteed to admit a robust control invariant (RCI) set. It builds upon the concurrent synthesis framework presented in [1], in which the requirement of existence of an RCI set is modeled as a control-oriented regularization. Here, we reduce the conservativeness of the approach by bounding the qLPV system with an uncertain LTI system, which we derive using bound propagation approaches. The resulting regularization function is the optimal value of a nonlinear robust optimization problem that we solve via a differentiable algorithm. We numerically demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach over two benchmark approaches.

Title: HuB: Learning Extreme Humanoid Balance
Authors: Tong Zhang, Boyuan Zheng, Ruiqian Nai, Yingdong Hu, Yen-Jen Wang, Geng Chen, Fanqi Lin, Jiongye Li, Chuye Hong, Koushil Sreenath, Yang Gao
Abstract: The human body demonstrates exceptional motor capabilities-such as standing steadily on one foot or performing a high kick with the leg raised over 1.5 meters-both requiring precise balance control. While recent research on humanoid control has leveraged reinforcement learning to track human motions for skill acquisition, applying this paradigm to balance-intensive tasks remains challenging. In this work, we identify three key obstacles: instability from reference motion errors, learning difficulties due to morphological mismatch, and the sim-to-real gap caused by sensor noise and unmodeled dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose HuB (Humanoid Balance), a unified framework that integrates reference motion refinement, balance-aware policy learning, and sim-to-real robustness training, with each component targeting a specific challenge. We validate our approach on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot across challenging quasi-static balance tasks, including extreme single-legged poses such as Swallow Balance and Bruce Lee's Kick. Our policy remains stable even under strong physical disturbances-such as a forceful soccer strike-while baseline methods consistently fail to complete these tasks. Project website: this https URL

Title: Interpretable Event Diagnosis in Water Distribution Networks
Authors: André Artelt, Stelios G. Vrachimis, Demetrios G. Eliades, Ulrike Kuhl, Barbara Hammer, Marios M. Polycarpou
Abstract: The increasing penetration of information and communication technologies in the design, monitoring, and control of water systems enables the use of algorithms for detecting and identifying unanticipated events (such as leakages or water contamination) using sensor measurements. However, data-driven methodologies do not always give accurate results and are often not trusted by operators, who may prefer to use their engineering judgment and experience to deal with such events. In this work, we propose a framework for interpretable event diagnosis -- an approach that assists the operators in associating the results of algorithmic event diagnosis methodologies with their own intuition and experience. This is achieved by providing contrasting (i.e., counterfactual) explanations of the results provided by fault diagnosis algorithms; their aim is to improve the understanding of the algorithm's inner workings by the operators, thus enabling them to take a more informed decision by combining the results with their personal experiences. Specifically, we propose counterfactual event fingerprints, a representation of the difference between the current event diagnosis and the closest alternative explanation, which can be presented in a graphical way. The proposed methodology is applied and evaluated on a realistic use case using the L-Town benchmark.

Title: Stiffness-based Analytic Centre Method for Cable-Driven Parallel Robots
Authors: Domenico Dona', Vincenzo Di Paola, Matteo Zoppi, Alberto Trevisani
Abstract: Nowadays, being fast and precise are key requirements in Robotics. This work introduces a novel methodology to tune the stiffness of Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs) while simultaneously addressing the tension distribution problem. In particular, the approach relies on the Analytic-Centre method. Indeed, weighting the barrier functions makes natural the stiffness adaptation. The intrinsic ability to adjust the stiffness during the execution of the task enables the CDPRs to effectively meet above-mentioned requirements. The capabilities of the method are demonstrated through simulations by comparing it with the existing approach.

Abstract: We present Task 5 of the DCASE 2025 Challenge: an Audio Question Answering (AQA) benchmark spanning multiple domains of sound understanding. This task defines three QA subsets (Bioacoustics, Temporal Soundscapes, and Complex QA) to test audio-language models on interactive question-answering over diverse acoustic scenes. We describe the dataset composition (from marine mammal calls to soundscapes and complex real-world clips), the evaluation protocol (top-1 accuracy with answer-shuffling robustness), and baseline systems (Qwen2-Audio-7B, AudioFlamingo 2, Gemini-2-Flash). Preliminary results on the development set are compared, showing strong variation across models and subsets. This challenge aims to advance the audio understanding and reasoning capabilities of audio-language models toward human-level acuity, which are crucial for enabling AI agents to perceive and interact about the world effectively.

Title: Apple's Synthetic Defocus Noise Pattern: Characterization and Forensic Applications
Authors: David Vázquez-Padín, Fernando Pérez-González, Pablo Pérez-Miguélez
Abstract: iPhone portrait-mode images contain a distinctive pattern in out-of-focus regions simulating the bokeh effect, which we term Apple's Synthetic Defocus Noise Pattern (SDNP). If overlooked, this pattern can interfere with blind forensic analyses, especially PRNU-based camera source verification, as noted in earlier works. Since Apple's SDNP remains underexplored, we provide a detailed characterization, proposing a method for its precise estimation, modeling its dependence on scene brightness, ISO settings, and other factors. Leveraging this characterization, we explore forensic applications of the SDNP, including traceability of portrait-mode images across iPhone models and iOS versions in open-set scenarios, assessing its robustness under post-processing. Furthermore, we show that masking SDNP-affected regions in PRNU-based camera source verification significantly reduces false positives, overcoming a critical limitation in camera attribution, and improving state-of-the-art techniques.

Title: Anti-windup design for internal model online constrained optimization
Authors: Umberto Casti, Sandro Zampieri
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel algorithmic design procedure for online constrained optimization grounded in control-theoretic principles. By integrating the Internal Model Principle (IMP) with an anti-windup compensation mechanism, the proposed Projected-Internal Model Anti-Windup (P-IMAW) gradient descent exploits a partial knowledge of the temporal evolution of the cost function to enhance tracking performance. The algorithm is developed through a structured synthesis procedure: first, a robust controller leveraging the IMP ensures asymptotic convergence in the unconstrained setting. Second, an anti-windup augmentation guarantees stability and performance in the presence of the projection operator needed to satisfy the constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical simulations comparing it against other classical techniques.

Title: Congestion-Sensitive Grid Aggregation for DC Optimal Power Flow
Authors: Benjamin Stöckl, Yannick Werner, Sonja Wogrin
Abstract: The vast spatial dimension of modern interconnected electricity grids challenges the tractability of the DC optimal power flow problem. Grid aggregation methods try to overcome this challenge by reducing the number of network elements. Many existing methods use Locational Marginal Prices as a distance metric to cluster nodes. In this paper, we show that prevalent methods adopting this distance metric fail to adequately capture the impact of individual lines when there is more than one line congested. This leads to suboptimal outcomes for the optimization of the aggregated model. To overcome those issues, we propose two methods based on the novel Network Congestion Price metric, which preserves the impact of nodal power injections on individual line congestions. The proposed methods are compared to several existing aggregation methods based on Locational Marginal Prices. We demonstrate all methods on adapted versions of the IEEE RTS 24- and 300-Bus systems. We show that the proposed methods outperform existing approaches both in terms of objective function value error and maximum line limit violation, while exhibiting faster node clustering. We conclude that aggregation methods based on the novel Network Congestion Price metric are better at preserving the essential physical characteristics of the network topology in the grid aggregation process than methods based on Locational Marginal Prices.

Title: Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for NOMA-Assisted Uplink Pinching-Antenna Systems
Authors: Ming Zeng, Xingwang Li, Ji Wang, Gaojian Huang, Octavia A. Dobre, Zhiguo Ding
Abstract: The pinching-antenna architecture has emerged as a promising solution for reconfiguring wireless propagation environments and enhancing system performance. While prior research has primarily focused on sum-rate maximization or transmit power minimization of pinching-antenna systems, the critical aspect of energy efficiency (EE) has received limited attention. Given the increasing importance of EE in future wireless communication networks, this work investigates EE optimization in a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-assisted multi-user pinching-antenna uplink system. The problem entails the joint optimization of the users' transmit power and the pinching-antenna position. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex due to tightly coupled variables. To tackle this, we employ an alternating optimization framework to decompose the original problem into two subproblems: one focusing on power allocation and the other on antenna positioning. A low-complexity optimal solution is derived for the power allocation subproblem, while the pinching-antenna positioning subproblem is addressed using a particle swarm optimization algorithm to obtain a high-quality near-optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms both conventional-antenna configurations and orthogonal multiple access-based pinching-antenna systems in terms of EE.

Title: Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS) Aided Over-the-air Computation
Authors: Zhonghao Lyu, Haoyun Li, Yulan Gao, Ming Xiao, H. Vincent Poor
Abstract: Over-the-air computation (AirComp) enables fast data aggregation for edge intelligence applications. However the performance of AirComp can be severely degraded by channel misalignments. Pinching antenna systems (PASS) have recently emerged as a promising solution for physically reshaping favorable wireless channels to reduce misalignments and thus AirComp errors, via low-cost, fully passive, and highly reconfigurable antenna deployment. Motivated by these benefits, we propose a novel PASS-aided AirComp system that introduces new design degrees of freedom through flexible pinching antenna (PA) placement. To improve performance, we consider a mean squared error (MSE) minimization problem by jointly optimizing the PA position, transmit power, and decoding vector. To solve this highly non-convex problem, we propose an alternating optimization based framework with Gauss-Seidel based PA position updates. Simulation results show that our proposed joint PA position and communication design significantly outperforms various benchmark schemes in AirComp accuracy.

Title: Lightweight End-to-end Text-to-speech Synthesis for low resource on-device applications
Authors: Biel Tura Vecino, Adam Gabryś, Daniel Mątwicki, Andrzej Pomirski, Tom Iddon, Marius Cotescu, Jaime Lorenzo-Trueba
Abstract: Recent works have shown that modelling raw waveform directly from text in an end-to-end (E2E) fashion produces more natural-sounding speech than traditional neural text-to-speech (TTS) systems based on a cascade or two-stage approach. However, current E2E state-of-the-art models are computationally complex and memory-consuming, making them unsuitable for real-time offline on-device applications in low-resource scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a Lightweight E2E-TTS (LE2E) model that generates high-quality speech requiring minimal computational resources. We evaluate the proposed model on the LJSpeech dataset and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance while being up to $90\%$ smaller in terms of model parameters and $10\times$ faster in real-time-factor. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed E2E training paradigm achieves better quality compared to an equivalent architecture trained in a two-stage approach. Our results suggest that LE2E is a promising approach for developing real-time, high quality, low-resource TTS applications for on-device applications.

Title: Spoken Language Understanding on Unseen Tasks With In-Context Learning
Authors: Neeraj Agrawal, Sriram Ganapathy
Abstract: Spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks involve diverse skills that probe the information extraction, classification and/or generation capabilities of models. In this setting, task-specific training data may not always be available. While traditional task-specific SLU models are unable to cater to such requirements, the speech-text large language models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative with emergent abilities. However, out of-the-box, our evaluations indicate that the zero/few-shot performance of prominent open-source speech-text LLMs on SLU tasks are not up to the mark. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to robust task-agnostic fine-tuning using randomized class labels. With this proposed fine-tuning, we illustrate that the performance of the speech-text LLMs on an unseen task is significantly improved over standard approaches. Critically, the proposed approach avoids the requirement of task-specific data annotations for enabling new tasks in speech-text LLMs.

Title: DexWild: Dexterous Human Interactions for In-the-Wild Robot Policies
Authors: Tony Tao, Mohan Kumar Srirama, Jason Jingzhou Liu, Kenneth Shaw, Deepak Pathak
Abstract: Large-scale, diverse robot datasets have emerged as a promising path toward enabling dexterous manipulation policies to generalize to novel environments, but acquiring such datasets presents many challenges. While teleoperation provides high-fidelity datasets, its high cost limits its scalability. Instead, what if people could use their own hands, just as they do in everyday life, to collect data? In DexWild, a diverse team of data collectors uses their hands to collect hours of interactions across a multitude of environments and objects. To record this data, we create DexWild-System, a low-cost, mobile, and easy-to-use device. The DexWild learning framework co-trains on both human and robot demonstrations, leading to improved performance compared to training on each dataset individually. This combination results in robust robot policies capable of generalizing to novel environments, tasks, and embodiments with minimal additional robot-specific data. Experimental results demonstrate that DexWild significantly improves performance, achieving a 68.5% success rate in unseen environments-nearly four times higher than policies trained with robot data only-and offering 5.8x better cross-embodiment generalization.

Next, we develop FDIAs on IEGSs when intruders have only local network topology and parameter information of an IEGS. Lastly, we explore FDIAs on IEGSs when intruders have only local network topology information of an IEGS.

Title: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Assisted Localization in OFDM Systems with Carrier Frequency Offset and Phase Noise
Authors: Hanfu Zhang, Erwu Liu, Rui Wang, Wei Ni, Zhe Xing, Yan Liu, Abbas Jamalipour
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted communication systems have been extensively studied for providing high-precision location services. However, most studies have overlooked the impact of carrier frequency offset (CFO) and phase noise (PN) resulting from hardware impairments on localization. This paper presents a novel, alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm to jointly estimate the CFO, PN, and user equipment (UE) position in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, where, provided the UE position, closed-form expressions for the CFO and PN are derived per iteration, significantly reducing the complexity and enhancing the stability of the algorithm. Another important aspect is a new RIS phase shift optimization algorithm developed to minimize the analytical lower bound of localization accuracy, hence benefiting localization. The semidefinite relaxation method and Schur complement are utilized to convexify this challenging non-convex optimization problem to a semidefinite program. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, with the localization accuracy enhanced by two orders of magnitude. The localization accuracy of the proposed algorithm is close to the analytical lower bound, with a root mean square error of lower than $\rm 10^{-2} \: m$.

Title: Application of a Novel Model Reduction Technique to the Assessment of Boundedness/Stability of Some Delay Time-Varying Vector Nonlinear Systems
Authors: Mark A. Pinsky
Abstract: Assessing the boundedness and stability of vector nonlinear systems with variable delays and coefficients remains a challenging problem with broad applications in science and engineering. Existing methods tend to produce overly conservative criteria that offer limited practical value and often fail to explicitly characterize the temporal evolution of solution norms. This paper presents a novel framework for evaluating the evolution of solution norms in such systems. This approach constructs scalar counterparts for the original vector equations. We prove that the solutions to these scalar nonlinear equations, which also include delays and variable coefficients, provide upper bounds for the norms of the original solutions, if the history functions for both equations are properly matched. This reduction enables the evaluation of the boundedness and stability of vector systems through the analysis of the dynamics of their scalar counterparts, which can be performed via straightforward simulations or simplified analytical reasoning. Consequently, we introduce new criteria for boundedness and stability and estimate the radii of the balls containing history functions that yield bounded or stable solutions for the original vector systems. Finally, we validated our inferences through representative simulations that also assessed the accuracy of the proposed approach.

Title: Sparse Regression Codes for Non-coherent SIMO channels
Authors: Sai Dinesh Kancharana, Madhusudan Kumar Sinha, Arun Pachai Kannu
Abstract: Motivated by hyper-reliable low-latency communication in 6G, we consider error control coding for short block lengths in multi-antenna fading channels. In general, the channel fading coefficients are unknown at both the transmitter and receiver, which is referred to as non-coherent channels. Conventionally, pilot symbols are transmitted to facilitate channel estimation, causing power and bandwidth overhead. Our paper considers sparse regression codes (SPARCs) for non-coherent flat-fading channels without using pilots. We develop a novel greedy decoder for SPARC using maximum likelihood principles, referred to as maximum likelihood matching pursuit (MLMP). MLMP works based on successive combining principles as opposed to conventional greedy algorithms, which are based on successive cancellation. We also obtain the noiseless perfect recovery condition for our successive combining algorithm. In addition, we develop an approximate message passing (AMP) SPARC decoder for the non-coherent flat fading model. Using simulation studies, we show that the MLMP decoder for SPARC outperforms AMP and other greedy decoders. Also, SPARC with MLMP decoder outperforms polar codes employing pilot-based channel estimation and polar codes with non-coherent decoders.

Title: On the Performance of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles with MIMO VLC
Authors: Hosein Zarini, Amir Mohammadisarab, Maryam Farajzadeh Dehkordi, Mohammad Robat Mili, Bardia Safaei, Ali Movaghar, Sinem Coleri, Eduard Jorswieck
Abstract: This paper centers around a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) visible light communication (VLC) system, where an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) benefits from a light emitting diode (LED) array to serve photo-diode (PD)-equipped users for illumination and communication simultaneously. Concerning the battery limitation of the UAV and considerable energy consumption of the LED array, a hybrid dimming control scheme is devised at the UAV that effectively controls the number of glared LEDs and thereby mitigates the overall energy consumption. To assess the performance of this system, a radio resource allocation problem is accordingly formulated for jointly optimizing the motion trajectory, transmit beamforming and LED selection at the UAV, assuming that channel state information (CSI) is partially available. By reformulating the optimization problem in Markov decision process (MDP) form, we propose a soft actor-critic (SAC) mechanism that captures the dynamics of the problem and optimizes its parameters. Additionally, regarding the high mobility of the UAV and thus remarkable rearrangement of the system, we enhance the trained SAC model by integrating a meta-learning strategy that enables more adaptation to system variations. By defining energy efficiency as a trade-off between the data rate and power consumption, simulations verify that upgrading a single-LED UAV by an array of 10 LEDs, exhibits 47% and 34% improvements in data rate and energy efficiency, albeit at the expense of 8% more power consumption.

Title: Safety-Critical Formation Control of Non-Holonomic Multi-Robot Systems in Communication-Limited Environments
Authors: Vishrut Bohara, Siavash Farzan
Abstract: This paper introduces a decentralized estimator-based safety-critical controller designed for formation control of non-holonomic mobile robots operating in communication-constrained environments. The proposed framework integrates a robust state estimator capable of accurately reconstructing neighboring agents' velocity vectors and orientations under varying dynamic conditions, with a decentralized formation tracking controller that leverages Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to guarantee collision avoidance and inter-agent safety. We present a closed-form control law that ensures both stability and string stability, effectively attenuating disturbances propagating from leader to followers. The theoretical foundations of the estimator and controller are established using Lyapunov stability analysis, which confirms global asymptotic stability under constant velocities and global uniformly ultimate boundedness under time-varying conditions. Extensive numerical simulations and realistic Gazebo-based experiments validate the effectiveness, robustness, and practical applicability of the proposed method, demonstrating precise formation tracking, stringent safety maintenance, and disturbance resilience without relying on inter-robot communication.

Title: Channel Estimation for Beyond Diagonal RIS via Tensor Decomposition
Authors: André L. F. de Almeida, Bruno Sokal, Hongyu Li, Bruno Clerckx
Abstract: This paper addresses the channel estimation problem for beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) from a tensor decomposition perspective. We first show that the received pilot signals can be arranged as a three-way tensor, allowing us to recast the cascaded channel estimation problem as a block Tucker decomposition problem that yields decoupled estimates for the involved channel matrices while offering a substantial performance gain over the conventional (matrix-based) least squares (LS) estimation method. More specifically, we develop two solutions to solve the problem. The first one is a closed-form solution that extracts the channel estimates via a block Tucker Kronecker factorization (BTKF), which boils down to solving a set of parallel rank-one matrix approximation problems. Exploiting such a low-rank property yields a noise rejection gain compared to the standard LS estimation scheme while allowing the two involved channels to be estimated separately. The second solution is based on a block Tucker alternating least squares (BTALS) algorithm that directly estimates the involved channel matrices using an iterative estimation procedure. We discuss the uniqueness and identifiability issues and their implications for training design. We also propose a tensor-based design of the BD-RIS training tensor for each algorithm that ensures unique decoupled channel estimates under trivial scaling ambiguities. Our numerical results shed light on the tradeoffs offered by BTKF and BTALS methods. Specifically, while the first enjoys fast and parallel extraction of the channel estimates in closed form, the second has a more flexible training design, allowing for a significantly reduced training overhead compared to the state-of-the-art LS method.

Title: Efficient Bilinear Attention-based Fusion for Medical Visual Question Answering
Authors: Zhilin Zhang, Jie Wang, Zhanghao Qin, Ruiqi Zhu, Xiaoliang Gong
Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) has attracted growing interest at the intersection of medical image understanding and natural language processing for clinical applications. By interpreting medical images and providing precise answers to relevant clinical inquiries, MedVQA has the potential to support diagnostic decision-making and reduce workload across various fields like radiology. While recent approaches rely heavily on unified large pre-trained Visual-Language Models, research on more efficient fusion mechanisms remains relatively limited in this domain. In this paper, we introduce a fusion model, OMniBAN, that integrates Orthogonality loss, Multi-head attention, and a Bilinear Attention Network to achieve high computational efficiency as well as solid performance. We conduct comprehensive experiments and demonstrate how bilinear attention fusion can approximate the performance of larger fusion models like cross-modal Transformer. Our results show that OMniBAN requires fewer parameters (approximately 2/3 of Transformer-based Co-Attention) and substantially lower FLOPs (approximately 1/4), while achieving comparable overall performance and even slight improvements on closed-ended questions on two key MedVQA benchmarks. This balance between efficiency and accuracy suggests that OMniBAN could be a viable option for real-world medical image question answering, where computational resources are often constrained.

Title: Reinforcement Learning-Based Downlink Transmit Precoding for Mitigating the Impact of Delayed CSI in Satellite Systems
Authors: Yasaman Omid, Marios Aristodemou, Sangarapillai Lambotharan, Mahsa Derakhshani, Lajos Hanzo
Abstract: The integration of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites with terrestrial communication networks holds the promise of seamless global connectivity. The efficiency of this connection, however, depends on the availability of reliable channel state information (CSI). Due to the large space-ground propagation delays, the estimated CSI is outdated. In this paper we consider the downlink of a satellite operating as a base station in support of multiple mobile users. The estimated outdated CSI is used at the satellite side to design a transmit precoding (TPC) matrix for the downlink. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach to optimize the TPC matrices, with the goal of maximizing the achievable data rate. We utilize the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to handle the continuous action space, and we employ state augmentation techniques to deal with the delayed observations and rewards. We show that the DRL agent is capable of exploiting the time-domain correlations of the channels for constructing accurate TPC matrices. This is because the proposed method is capable of compensating for the effects of delayed CSI in different frequency bands. Furthermore, we study the effect of handovers in the system, and show that the DRL agent is capable of promptly adapting to the environment when a handover occurs.

Title: Distributed Coordination of Grid-Forming and Grid-Following Inverters for Optimal Frequency Control in Power Systems
Authors: Xiaoyang Wang, Xin Chen
Abstract: The large-scale integration of inverter-interfaced renewable energy sources presents significant challenges to maintaining power balance and nominal frequency in modern power systems. This paper studies grid-level coordinated control of grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) inverter-based resources (IBRs) for scalable and optimal frequency control. We propose a fully distributed optimal frequency control algorithm based on the projected primal-dual gradient method and by leveraging the structure of the underlying physical system dynamics. The proposed algorithm i) restores the nominal system frequency while minimizing total control cost and enforcing IBR power capacity limits and line thermal constraints, and ii) operates in a distributed manner that only needs local measurements and neighbor-to-neighbor communication. In particular, when the line thermal constraints are disregarded, the proposed algorithm admits a fully local implementation that requires no communication, while still ensuring optimality and satisfying IBR power capacity limits. We establish the global asymptotic convergence of the algorithm using Lyapunov stability analysis. The effectiveness and optimality of the proposed algorithms are validated through high-fidelity, 100% inverter-based electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations on the IEEE 39-bus system.

Title: Automotive Speed Estimation: Sensor Types and Error Characteristics from OBD-II to ADAS
Authors: Hany Ragab (1), Sidney Givigi (2), Aboelmagd Noureldin (1 and 2) ((1) Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Queens University and the NavINST Lab at the Royal Military College of Canada, (2) School of Computing at Queens University)
Abstract: Modern on-road navigation systems heavily depend on integrating speed measurements with inertial navigation systems (INS) and global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). Telemetry-based applications typically source speed data from the On-Board Diagnostic II (OBD-II) system. However, the method of deriving speed, as well as the types of sensors used to measure wheel speed, differs across vehicles. These differences result in varying error characteristics that must be accounted for in navigation and autonomy applications. This paper addresses this gap by examining the diverse speed-sensing technologies employed in standard automotive systems and alternative techniques used in advanced systems designed for higher levels of autonomy, such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), Autonomous Driving (AD), or surveying applications. We propose a method to identify the type of speed sensor in a vehicle and present strategies for accurately modeling its error characteristics. To validate our approach, we collected and analyzed data from three long real road trajectories conducted in urban environments in Toronto and Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The results underscore the critical role of integrating multiple sensor modalities to achieve more accurate speed estimation, thus improving automotive navigation state estimation, particularly in GNSS-denied environments.

Title: Data-Driven Yet Formal Policy Synthesis for Stochastic Nonlinear Dynamical Systems
Authors: Mahdi Nazeri, Thom Badings, Sadegh Soudjani, Alessandro Abate
Abstract: The automated synthesis of control policies for stochastic dynamical systems presents significant challenges. A standard approach is to construct a finite-state abstraction of the continuous system, typically represented as a Markov decision process (MDP). However, generating abstractions is challenging when (1) the system's dynamics are nonlinear, and/or (2) we do not have complete knowledge of the dynamics. In this work, we introduce a novel data-driven abstraction technique for nonlinear Lipschitz continuous dynamical systems with additive stochastic noise that addresses both of these issues. As a key step, we use samples of the dynamics to learn the enabled actions and transition probabilities of the abstraction. We represent abstractions as MDPs with intervals of transition probabilities, known as interval MDPs (IMDPs). These abstractions enable the synthesis of policies for the concrete nonlinear system, with probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantees on the probability of satisfying a specified control objective. Our numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach in achieving reliable control under uncertainty.

Title: Analysis of Power Losses and the Efficacy of Power Minimization Strategies in Multichannel Electrical Stimulation Systems
Authors: Francesc Varkevisser, Wouter A. Serdijn, Tiago L. Costa
Abstract: Neuroprosthetic devices require multichannel stimulator systems with an increasing number of channels. However, there are inherent power losses in typical multichannel stimulation circuits caused by a mismatch between the power supply voltage and the voltage required at each electrode to successfully stimulate tissue. This imposes a bottleneck towards high-channel-count devices, which is particularly severe in wirelessly-powered devices. Hence, advances in the power efficiency of stimulation systems are critical. To support these advances, this paper presents a methodology to identify and quantify power losses associated with different power supply scaling strategies in multichannel stimulation systems. The proposed methodology utilizes distributions of stimulation amplitudes and electrode impedances to calculate power losses in multichannel systems. Experimental data from previously published studies spanning various stimulation applications were analyzed to evaluate the performance of fixed, global, and stepped supply scaling methods, focusing on their impact on power dissipation and efficiency. Variability in output conditions results in low power efficiency in multichannel stimulation systems across all applications. Stepped voltage scaling demonstrated substantial efficiency improvements, achieving an increase of 67 % to 146 %, particularly in high-channel-count applications with significant variability in tissue impedance. Global scaling, by contrast, was more advantageous for systems with fewer channels. The findings highlight the importance of tailoring power management strategies to specific applications to optimize efficiency while minimizing system complexity. The proposed methodology offers a framework for evaluating efficiency-complexity trade-offs, advancing the design of scalable neurostimulation systems.

Title: RadioLLM: Introducing Large Language Model into Cognitive Radio via Hybrid Prompt and Token Reprogrammings
Authors: Shuai Chen, Yong Zu, Zhixi Feng, Shuyuan Yang, Mengchang Li
Abstract: The growing scarcity of spectrum resources and rapid proliferation of wireless devices make efficient radio network management critical. While deep learning-enhanced Cognitive Radio Technology (CRT) provides promising solutions for tasks such as radio signal classification (RSC), denoising, and spectrum allocation, existing DL-based CRT frameworks are typically task-specific and lack scalability in diverse real-world applications. This limitation naturally leads to the exploration of Large Language Models (LLMs), whose exceptional cross-domain generalization capabilities offer new potential for advancing CRT. To bridge this gap, we propose RadioLLM, a novel framework that integrates Hybrid Prompt and Token Reprogramming (HPTR) for combining radio signal features with expert knowledge, and a Frequency-Attuned Fusion (FAF) module for enhanced high-frequency feature modeling. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that RadioLLM achieves superior performance compared to existing baselines in the majority of testing scenarios.

Title: Coupled Rendezvous and Docking Maneuver control of satellite using Reinforcement learning-based Adaptive Fixed-Time Sliding Mode Controller
Authors: Rakesh Kumar Sahoo, Manoranjan Sinha
Abstract: Satellite dynamics in unknown environments are inherently uncertain due to factors such as varying gravitational fields, atmospheric drag, and unpredictable interactions with space debris or other celestial bodies. Traditional sliding mode controllers with fixed parameters often struggle to maintain optimal performance under these fluctuating conditions. Therefore, an adaptive controller is essential to address these challenges by continuously tuning its gains in real-time. In this paper, we have tuned the slopes of the Fixed-time Sliding surface adaptively using reinforcement learning for coupled rendezvous and docking maneuver of chaser satellite with the target satellite in an unknown space environment. The neural network model is used to determine the optimal gains of reaching law of the fixed-time sliding surface. We have assumed that we don't have an accurate model of the system so we have added noise in the tangent space instead of directly on the manifold to preserve the geometric structure of the system while ensuring mathematically consistent uncertainty propagation. The reinforcement learning is used as an approximator to represent the value function of the agent to estimate the dynamical model of the system using the Actor-Critic method. The proposed control algorithm integrates a neural network and a sliding mode controller in a cascade loop architecture, where the tracking error dynamically tunes the sliding surface gains. Global fixed-time stability of the closed-loop feedback system is proved within the Lyapunov framework. This comprehensive approach of fixed-time sliding mode controller using a Reinforcement Learning based ensures the completion of the mission efficiently while addressing the critical challenges posed by the uncertain environment. The simulation results presented support the claims made.

Title: Upper Mid-Band Spectrum for 6G: Vision, Opportunity and Challenges
Authors: Ahmad Bazzi, Roberto Bomfin, Marco Mezzavilla, Sundeep Rangan, Theodore Rappaport, Marwa Chafii
Abstract: Driven by the pursuit of gigabit-per-second data speeds for future 6G mobile networks, in addition to the support of sensing and artificial intelligence applications, the industry is expanding beyond crowded sub-6 GHz bands with innovative new spectrum allocations. In this paper, we chart a compelling vision for 6G within the frequency range 3 (FR3) spectrum, i.e. $7.125$-$24.25$ $\GHz$, by delving into its key enablers and addressing the multifaceted challenges that lie ahead for these new frequency bands. Here we highlight the physical properties of this \textcolor{black}{never-before} used spectrum by reviewing recent channel measurements for outdoor and indoor environments, including path loss, delay and angular spreads, and material penetration loss, all which offer insights that underpin future 5G/6G wireless communication designs. Building on the fundamental knowledge of the channel properties, we explore FR3 spectrum agility strategies that balance coverage and capacity (e.g. data rate) tradeoffs, while also examining coexistence with incumbent systems, such as satellites, radio astronomy, and earth exploration. Moreover, we discuss the potential of massive multiple-input multiple-output, compact and digital architectures, and evaluate the potential of multiband sensing for FR3 integrated sensing and communications. Finally, we outline 6G standardization features that are likely to emerge from 3GPP radio frame innovations and open radio access network developments.

Title: Sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics with high accuracy and reliability under noisy conditions for applications to industrial systems
Authors: Shuichi Yahagi, Ansei Yonezawa, Hiroki Seto, Heisei Yonezawa, Itsuro Kajiwara
Abstract: This paper proposes a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) with control and exogenous inputs for highly accurate and reliable prediction. The method is applied to the diesel engine airpath systems, which are known as a nonlinear complicated industrial system. Although SINDy is recognized as a remarkable approach for identifying nonlinear systems, several challenges remain. Its application to industrial systems remains limited, and multi-step predictions are not guaranteed due to overfitting and noisy data. This phenomenon is often caused by the increase in basis functions resulting from the extension of coordinates, such as time-delay embedding. To address these problems, we propose an emphasized SINDy by incorporating ensemble learning, elite gathering, and classification techniques while keeping convex calculation. The proposed method employs library bagging and extracts elites with an R-squared greater than 90%. Then, clustering is performed on the surviving elites because physically motivated basis functions are not always available, and the elites obtained do not always show the same trends. After the classification, discrete model candidates are obtained by taking the mean of each classified elite. Finally, the best model is selected. The simulation results show that the proposed method realizes multi-step prediction for the airpath system, which is known to be a complicated industrial system under noisy conditions.

Title: Adaptive Mixture of Low-Rank Experts for Robust Audio Spoofing Detection
Authors: Qixian Chen, Yuxiong Xu, Sara Mandelli, Sheng Li, Bin Li
Abstract: In audio spoofing detection, most studies rely on clean datasets, making models susceptible to real-world post-processing attacks, such as channel compression and noise. To overcome this challenge, we propose the Adaptive MixtUre Low-rank ExperTs (AMULET) framework, which enhances resilience by leveraging attack-specific knowledge and dynamically adapting to varied attack conditions. Specifically, AMULET employs Attack-Specific Experts (ASEs) fine-tuned with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), allowing each expert to focus on distinct post-processing patterns using just 1.13\% of the parameters required for full fine-tuning. Furthermore, we introduce Adaptive Expert Fusion (AEF), which adaptively selects and integrates expert knowledge to enhance the robustness of spoofing detection. Experimental results demonstrate that AMULET significantly enhances robustness by improving noise resilience and exhibiting greater adaptability to unseen post-processing methods compared to models trained with full fine-tuning. Additionally, our framework outperforms both single expert and other expert aggregation strategies under various mixed attacks, demonstrating its superior robustness and adaptability in managing complex real-world scenarios.

Title: Controlling Peak Sharpness in Multimodal Biomolecular Systems via the Chemical Fokker-Planck Equation
Authors: Taishi Kotsuka, Enoch Yeung
Abstract: Intracellular biomolecular systems exhibit intrinsic stochasticity due to low molecular copy numbers, leading to multimodal probability distributions that play a crucial role in probabilistic differentiation and cellular decision-making. Controlling the dispersion of multimodal probability distributions in biomolecular systems is critical for regulating stochastic behavior, robustness, and adaptability. However, modifying system parameters to adjust dispersion often affects peak positions, potentially altering a desired phenotype or even fundamental behavior in a genetic pathway. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework that enables independent control of dispersion while preserving peak positions and modality using the Chemical Fokker-Planck Equation (CFPE) and sharpness, a measure of probability concentration around individual peaks. By analyzing the steady-state solution of the CFPE, we derive explicit conditions under which peak sharpness can be tuned monotonically without changing peak positions or modality. We validate our approach through Monte Carlo simulations on a bimodal chemical system, demonstrating effective dispersion control while maintaining structural stability. This framework provides a systematic approach for designing biomolecular systems with tunable stochastic properties, contributing to advancements in synthetic biology and probabilistic cellular regulation.

Title: OmniAudio: Generating Spatial Audio from 360-Degree Video
Authors: Huadai Liu, Tianyi Luo, Qikai Jiang, Kaicheng Luo, Peiwen Sun, Jialei Wan, Rongjie Huang, Qian Chen, Wen Wang, Xiangtai Li, Shiliang Zhang, Zhijie Yan, Zhou Zhao, Wei Xue
Abstract: Traditional video-to-audio generation techniques primarily focus on field-of-view (FoV) video and non-spatial audio, often missing the spatial cues necessary for accurately representing sound sources in 3D environments. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel task, 360V2SA, to generate spatial audio from 360-degree videos, specifically producing First-order Ambisonics (FOA) audio - a standard format for representing 3D spatial audio that captures sound directionality and enables realistic 3D audio reproduction. We first create Sphere360, a novel dataset tailored for this task that is curated from real-world data. We also design an efficient semi-automated pipeline for collecting and cleaning paired video-audio data. To generate spatial audio from 360-degree video, we propose a novel framework OmniAudio, which leverages self-supervised pre-training using both spatial audio data (in FOA format) and large-scale non-spatial data. Furthermore, OmniAudio features a dual-branch framework that utilizes both panoramic and FoV video inputs to capture comprehensive local and global information from 360-degree videos. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance across both objective and subjective metrics on Sphere360. Code and datasets will be released at this https URL.

Title: Discrete Codebook Design for Self-interference Suppression in mmWave ISAC
Authors: Guang Chai, Zhibin Yu, Thomas Wagner, Xiaofeng Wu, Giuseppe Caire
Abstract: This paper presents discrete codebook synthesis methods for self-interference (SI) suppression in a mmWave device, designed to support FD ISAC. We formulate a SINR maximization problem that optimizes the RX and TX codewords, aimed at suppressing the near-field SI signal while maintaining the beamforming gain in the far-field sensing directions. The formulation considers the practical constraints of discrete RX and TX codebooks with quantized phase settings, as well as a TX beamforming gain requirement in the specified communication direction. Under an alternating optimization framework, the RX and TX codewords are iteratively optimized, with one fixed while the other is optimized. When the TX codeword is fixed, we show that the RX codeword optimization problem can be formulated as an integer quadratic fractional programming (IQFP) problem. Using Dinkelbach's algorithm, we transform the problem into a sequence of subproblems in which the numerator and the denominator of the objective function are decoupled. These subproblems, subject to discrete constraints, are then efficiently solved by the spherical search (SS) method. This overall approach is referred to as FP-SS. When the RX codeword is fixed, the TX codeword optimization problem can similarly be formulated as an IQFP problem, whereas an additional TX beamforming constraint for communication needs to be considered. The problem is solved through Dinkelbach's transformation followed by the constrained spherical search (CSS), and we refer to this approach as FP-CSS. Finally, we integrate the FP-SS and FP-CSS methods into a joint RX-TX codebook design approach. Simulations show that, the proposed FP-SS and FP-CSS achieve the same SI suppression performance as the corresponding exhaustive search method, but with much lower complexity. Furthermore, the alternating optimization framework achieved even better SI suppression performance.

Title: From Spaceborne to Airborne: SAR Image Synthesis Using Foundation Models for Multi-Scale Adaptation
Authors: Solene Debuysere, Nicolas Trouve, Nathan Letheule, Olivier Leveque, Elise Colin
Abstract: The availability of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery has increased considerably in recent years, with datasets commercially available. However, the acquisition of high-resolution SAR images in airborne configurations, remains costly and limited. Thus, the lack of open source, well-labeled, or easily exploitable SAR text-image datasets is a barrier to the use of existing foundation models in remote sensing applications. In this context, synthetic image generation is a promising solution to augment this scarce data, enabling a broader range of applications. Leveraging over 15 years of ONERA's extensive archival airborn data from acquisition campaigns, we created a comprehensive training dataset of 110 thousands SAR images to exploit a 3.5 billion parameters pre-trained latent diffusion model \cite{Baqu2019SethiR}. In this work, we present a novel approach utilizing spatial conditioning techniques within a foundation model to transform satellite SAR imagery into airborne SAR representations. Additionally, we demonstrate that our pipeline is effective for bridging the realism of simulated images generated by ONERA's physics-based simulator EMPRISE \cite{empriseem_ai_images}. Our method explores a key application of AI in advancing SAR imaging technology. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce this approach in the literature.

Title: The stability of generalized phase retrieval problem over compact groups
Authors: Tal Amir, Tamir Bendory, Nadav Dym, Dan Edidin
Abstract: The generalized phase retrieval problem over compact groups aims to recover a set of matrices, representing an unknown signal, from their associated Gram matrices, leveraging prior structural knowledge about the signal. This framework generalizes the classical phase retrieval problem, which reconstructs a signal from the magnitudes of its Fourier transform, to a richer setting involving non-abelian compact groups. In this broader context, the unknown phases in Fourier space are replaced by unknown orthogonal matrices that arise from the action of a compact group on a finite-dimensional vector space. This problem is primarily motivated by advances in electron microscopy to determining the 3D structure of biological macromolecules from highly noisy observations. To capture realistic assumptions from machine learning and signal processing, we model the signal as belonging to one of several broad structural families: a generic linear subspace, a sparse representation in a generic basis, the output of a generic ReLU neural network, or a generic low-dimensional manifold. Our main result shows that, under mild conditions, the generalized phase retrieval problem not only admits a unique solution (up to inherent group symmetries), but also satisfies a bi-Lipschitz property. This implies robustness to both noise and model mismatch, an essential requirement for practical use, especially when measurements are severely corrupted by noise. These findings provide theoretical support for a wide class of scientific problems under modern structural assumptions, and they offer strong foundations for developing robust algorithms in high-noise regimes.

Title: Automated Fuzzing of Automotive Control Units
Authors: Timothy Werquin, Roos Hubrechtsen, Ashok Thangarajan, Frank Piessens, Jan Tobias Muehlberg
Abstract: Modern vehicles are governed by a network of Electronic Control Units (ECUs), which are programmed to sense inputs from the driver and the environment, to process these inputs, and to control actuators that, e.g., regulate the engine or even control the steering system. ECUs within a vehicle communicate via automotive bus systems such as the Controller Area Network (CAN), and beyond the vehicles boundaries through upcoming vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure channels. Approaches to manipulate the communication between ECUs for the purpose of security testing and reverse-engineering of vehicular functions have been presented in the past, all of which struggle with automating the detection of system change in response to message injection. In this paper we present our findings with fuzzing CAN networks, in particular while observing individual ECUs with a sensor harness. The harness detects physical responses, which we then use in a oracle functions to inform the fuzzing process. We systematically define fuzzers, fuzzing configurations and oracle functions for testing ECUs. We evaluate our approach based on case studies of commercial instrument clusters and with an experimental framework for CAN authentication. Our results show that the approach is capable of identifying interesting ECU states with a high level of automation. Our approach is applicable in distributed cyber-physical systems beyond automotive computing.

Title: Audio Transformers
Authors: Prateek Verma, Jonathan Berger
Abstract: Over the past two decades, CNN architectures have produced compelling models of sound perception and cognition, learning hierarchical organizations of features. Analogous to successes in computer vision, audio feature classification can be optimized for a particular task of interest, over a wide variety of datasets and labels. In fact similar architectures designed for image understanding have proven effective for acoustic scene analysis. Here we propose applying Transformer based architectures without convolutional layers to raw audio signals. On a standard dataset of Free Sound 50K,comprising of 200 categories, our model outperforms convolutional models to produce state of the art results. This is significant as unlike in natural language processing and computer vision, we do not perform unsupervised pre-training for outperforming convolutional architectures. On the same training set, with respect mean aver-age precision benchmarks, we show a significant improvement. We further improve the performance of Transformer architectures by using techniques such as pooling inspired from convolutional net-work designed in the past few years. In addition, we also show how multi-rate signal processing ideas inspired from wavelets, can be applied to the Transformer embeddings to improve the results. We also show how our models learns a non-linear non constant band-width filter-bank, which shows an adaptable time frequency front end representation for the task of audio understanding, different from other tasks e.g. pitch estimation.

Title: The Pump Scheduling Problem: A Real-World Scenario for Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Henrique Donâncio, Laurent Vercouter, Harald Roclawski
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has demonstrated impressive results in domains such as games and robotics, where task formulations are well-defined. However, few DRL benchmarks are grounded in complex, real-world environments, where safety constraints, partial observability, and the need for hand-engineered task representations pose significant challenges. To help bridge this gap, we introduce a testbed based on the pump scheduling problem in a real-world water distribution facility. The task involves controlling pumps to ensure a reliable water supply while minimizing energy consumption and respecting the constraints of the system. Our testbed includes a realistic simulator, three years of high-resolution (1-minute) operational data from human-led control, and a baseline RL task formulation. This testbed supports a wide range of research directions, including offline RL, safe exploration, inverse RL, and multi-objective optimization.

Title: Psychophysiology-aided Perceptually Fluent Speech Analysis of Children Who Stutter
Authors: Yi Xiao, Harshit Sharma, Victoria Tumanova, Asif Salekin
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach named PASAD that detects changes in perceptually fluent speech acoustics of young children. Particularly, analysis of perceptually fluent speech enables identifying the speech-motor-control factors that are considered as the underlying cause of stuttering disfluencies. Recent studies indicate that the speech production of young children, especially those who stutter, may get adversely affected by situational physiological arousal. A major contribution of this paper is leveraging the speaker's situational physiological responses in real-time to analyze the speech signal effectively. The presented PASAD approach adapts a Hyper-Network structure to extract temporal speech importance information leveraging physiological parameters. Moreover, we collected speech and physiological sensing data from 73 preschool-age children who stutter (CWS) and who do not stutter (CWNS) in different conditions. PASAD's unique architecture enables identifying speech attributes distinct to a CWS's fluent speech and mapping them to the speaker's respective speech-motor-control factors. Extracted knowledge can enhance understanding of children's speech-motor-control and stuttering development. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that PASAD outperforms state-of-the-art multi-modal baseline approaches in different conditions, is expressive and adaptive to the speaker's speech and physiology, generalizable, robust, and is real-time executable.

Title: Probabilistic detection of GNSS spoofing using opportunistic information
Authors: Wenjie Liu, Panos Papadimitratos
Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are integrated into many devices. However, civilian GNSS signals are usually not cryptographically protected. This makes attacks that forge signals relatively easy. Considering modern devices often have network connections and onboard sensors, the proposed here Probabilistic Detection of GNSS Spoofing (PDS) scheme is based on such opportunistic information. PDS has at its core two parts. First, a regression problem with motion model constraints, which equalizes the noise of all locations considering the motion model of the device. Second, a Gaussian process, that analyzes statistical properties of location data to construct uncertainty. Then, a likelihood function, that fuses the two parts, as a basis for a Neyman-Pearson lemma (NPL)-based detection strategy. Our experimental evaluation shows a performance gain over the state-of-the-art, in terms of attack detection effectiveness.

Title: Contaminated Multivariate Time-Series Anomaly Detection with Spatio-Temporal Graph Conditional Diffusion Models
Authors: Thi Kieu Khanh Ho, Narges Armanfard
Abstract: Mainstream unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms often excel in academic datasets, yet their real-world performance is restricted due to the controlled experimental conditions involving clean training data. Addressing the challenge of training with noise, a prevalent issue in practical anomaly detection, is frequently overlooked. In a pioneering endeavor, this study delves into the realm of label-level noise within sensory time-series anomaly detection (TSAD). This paper presents a novel and practical end-to-end unsupervised TSAD when the training data is contaminated with anomalies. The introduced approach, called TSAD-C, is devoid of access to abnormality labels during the training phase. TSAD-C encompasses three core modules: a Decontaminator to rectify anomalies (aka noise) present during training, a Long-range Variable Dependency Modeling module to capture long-term intra- and inter-variable dependencies within the decontaminated data that is considered as a surrogate of the pure normal data, and an Anomaly Scoring module to detect anomalies from all types. Our extensive experiments conducted on four reliable and diverse datasets conclusively demonstrate that TSAD-C surpasses existing methodologies, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art in the TSAD field.

Title: Survey on Near-Space Information Networks: Channel Modeling, Transmission, and Networking Perspectives
Authors: Xianbin Cao, Xiaoning Su, Peng Yang, Yue Gao, Dapeng Oliver Wu, Tony Q. S. Quek
Abstract: Near-space information networks (NSINs) composed of high-altitude platforms (HAPs) and high- and low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are a new regime for providing quick, robust, and cost-efficient sensing and communication services. Precipitated by innovations and breakthroughs in manufacturing, materials, communications, electronics, and control techniques, NSINs have been envisioned as an essential component of the emerging sixth-generation of mobile communication systems. This article reveals some critical issues needing to be tackled in NSINs through conducting experiments and discusses the latest advances in NSINs in the research areas of channel modeling, networking, and transmission from a forward-looking, comparative, and technical evolutionary perspective. In this article, we highlight the characteristics of NSINs and present the promising use cases of NSINs. The impact of airborne platforms' unstable movements on the phase delays of onboard antenna arrays with diverse structures is mathematically analyzed. The recent advances in HAP channel modeling are elaborated on, along with the significant differences between HAP and UAV channel modeling. A comprehensive review of the networking techniques of NSINs in network deployment, handoff management, and network management aspects is provided. Besides, the promising techniques and communication protocols of the physical (PHY) layer, medium access control (MAC) layer, network layer, and transport layer of NSINs for achieving efficient transmission over NSINs are reviewed, and we have conducted experiments with practical NSINs to verify the performance of some techniques. Finally, we outline some open issues and promising directions for NSINs deserved for future study and discuss the corresponding challenges.

Title: Tight Finite Time Bounds of Two-Time-Scale Linear Stochastic Approximation with Markovian Noise
Authors: Shaan Ul Haque, Sajad Khodadadian, Siva Theja Maguluri
Abstract: Stochastic approximation (SA) is an iterative algorithm for finding the fixed point of an operator using noisy samples and widely used in optimization and Reinforcement Learning (RL). The noise in RL exhibits a Markovian structure, and in some cases, such as gradient temporal difference (GTD) methods, SA is employed in a two-time-scale framework. This combination introduces significant theoretical challenges for analysis. We derive an upper bound on the error for the iterations of linear two-time-scale SA with Markovian noise. We demonstrate that the mean squared error decreases as $trace (\Sigma^y)/k + o(1/k)$ where $k$ is the number of iterates, and $\Sigma^y$ is an appropriately defined covariance matrix. A key feature of our bounds is that the leading term, $\Sigma^y$, exactly matches with the covariance in the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) for the two-time-scale SA, and we call them tight finite-time bounds. We illustrate their use in RL by establishing sample complexity for off-policy algorithms, TDC, GTD, and GTD2. A special case of linear two-time-scale SA that is extensively studied is linear SA with Polyak-Ruppert averaging. We present tight finite time bounds corresponding to the covariance matrix of the CLT. Such bounds can be used to study TD-learning with Polyak-Ruppert averaging.

Title: A new framework for constrained optimization via feedback control of Lagrange multipliers
Authors: V. Cerone, S. M. Fosson, S. Pirrera, D. Regruto
Abstract: The continuous-time analysis of existing iterative algorithms for optimization has a long history. This work proposes a novel continuous-time control-theoretic framework for equality-constrained optimization. The key idea is to design a feedback control system where the Lagrange multipliers are the control input, and the output represents the constraints. The system converges to a stationary point of the constrained optimization problem through suitable regulation. Regarding the Lagrange multipliers, we consider two control laws: proportional-integral control and feedback linearization. These choices give rise to a family of different methods. We rigorously develop the related algorithms, theoretically analyze their convergence and present several numerical experiments to support their effectiveness concerning the state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Optical coherence Doppler tomography (ODT) is an emerging blood flow imaging technique. The fundamental unit of ODT is the 1D depth-resolved trace named raw A-scans (or A-line). A 2D ODT image (B-scan) is formed by reconstructing a cross-sectional flow image via Doppler phase-subtraction of raw A-scans along B-line. To obtain a high-fidelity B-scan, densely sampled A-scans are required currently, leading to prolonged scanning time and increased storage demands. Addressing this issue, we propose a novel sparse ODT reconstruction framework with an Alternative State Space Attention Network (ASSAN) that effectively reduces raw A-scans needed. Inspired by the distinct distributions of information along A-line and B-line, ASSAN applies 1D State Space Model (SSM) to each A-line to learn the intra-A-scan representation, while using 1D gated self-attention along B-line to capture the inter-A-scan features. In addition, an effective feedforward network based on sequential 1D convolutions along different axes is employed to enhance the local feature. In validation experiments on real animal data, ASSAN shows clear effectiveness in the reconstruction in comparison with state-of-the-art reconstruction methods.

Title: MAPL: Memory Augmentation and Pseudo-Labeling for Semi-Supervised Anomaly Detection
Authors: Junzhuo Chen, Shitong Kang
Abstract: Large unlabeled data and difficult-to-identify anomalies are the urgent issues need to overcome in most industrial scene. In order to address this issue, a new meth-odology for detecting surface defects in in-dustrial settings is introduced, referred to as Memory Augmentation and Pseudo-Labeling(MAPL). The methodology first in-troduces an anomaly simulation strategy, which significantly improves the model's ability to recognize rare or unknown anom-aly types by generating simulated anomaly samples. To cope with the problem of the lack of labeling of anomalous simulated samples, a pseudo-labeler method based on a one-classifier ensemble was employed in this study, which enhances the robustness of the model in the case of limited labeling data by automatically selecting key pseudo-labeling hyperparameters. Meanwhile, a memory-enhanced learning mechanism is introduced to effectively predict abnormal regions by analyzing the difference be-tween the input samples and the normal samples in the memory pool. An end-to-end learning framework is employed by MAPL to identify the abnormal regions directly from the input data, which optimizes the ef-ficiency and real-time performance of de-tection. By conducting extensive trials on the recently developed BHAD dataset (in-cluding MVTec AD [1], Visa [2], and MDPP [3]), MAPL achieves an average im-age-level AUROC score of 86.2%, demon-strating a 5.1% enhancement compared to the original MemSeg [4] model.

Title: Generalized Compressed Sensing for Image Reconstruction with Diffusion Probabilistic Models
Authors: Ling-Qi Zhang, Zahra Kadkhodaie, Eero P. Simoncelli, David H. Brainard
Abstract: We examine the problem of selecting a small set of linear measurements for reconstructing high-dimensional signals. Well-established methods for optimizing such measurements include principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA) and compressed sensing (CS) based on random projections, all of which rely on axis- or subspace-aligned statistical characterization of the signal source. However, many naturally occurring signals, including photographic images, contain richer statistical structure. To exploit such structure, we introduce a general method for obtaining an optimized set of linear measurements for efficient image reconstruction, where the signal statistics are expressed by the prior implicit in a neural network trained to perform denoising (known as a ``diffusion model''). We demonstrate that the optimal measurements derived for two natural image datasets differ from those of PCA, ICA, or CS, and result in substantially lower mean squared reconstruction error. Interestingly, the marginal distributions of the measurement values are asymmetrical (skewed), substantially more so than those of previous methods. We also find that optimizing with respect to perceptual loss, as quantified by structural similarity (SSIM), leads to measurements different from those obtained when optimizing for MSE. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating the specific statistical regularities of natural signals when designing effective linear measurements.

Title: DC is all you need: describing ReLU from a signal processing standpoint
Authors: Christodoulos Kechris, Jonathan Dan, Jose Miranda, David Atienza
Abstract: Non-linear activation functions are crucial in Convolutional Neural Networks. However, until now they have not been well described in the frequency domain. In this work, we study the spectral behavior of ReLU, a popular activation function. We use the ReLU's Taylor expansion to derive its frequency domain behavior. We demonstrate that ReLU introduces higher frequency oscillations in the signal and a constant DC component. Furthermore, we investigate the importance of this DC component, where we demonstrate that it helps the model extract meaningful features related to the input frequency content. We accompany our theoretical derivations with experiments and real-world examples. First, we numerically validate our frequency response model. Then we observe ReLU's spectral behavior on two example models and a real-world one. Finally, we experimentally investigate the role of the DC component introduced by ReLU in the CNN's representations. Our results indicate that the DC helps to converge to a weight configuration that is close to the initial random weights.

Title: Energetic Resilience of Linear Driftless Systems
Authors: Ram Padmanabhan, Melkior Ornik
Abstract: When a malfunction causes a control system to lose authority over a subset of its actuators, achieving a task may require spending additional energy in order to compensate for the effect of uncontrolled inputs. To understand this increase in energy, we introduce an energetic resilience metric that quantifies the maximal additional energy required to achieve finite-time regulation in linear driftless systems that suffer this malfunction. We first derive optimal control signals and minimum energies to achieve this task in both the nominal and malfunctioning systems. We then obtain a bound on the worst-case energy used by the malfunctioning system, and its exact expression in the special case of loss of authority over one actuator. Further considering this special case, we derive a bound on the metric for energetic resilience. A simulation example on a model of an underwater robot demonstrates that this bound is useful in quantifying the increased energy used by a system suffering such a malfunction.

Title: Learning to Drift in Extreme Turning with Active Exploration and Gaussian Process Based MPC
Authors: Guoqiang Wu, Cheng Hu, Wangjia Weng, Zhouheng Li, Yonghao Fu, Lei Xie, Hongye Su
Abstract: Extreme cornering in racing often leads to large sideslip angles, presenting a significant challenge for vehicle control. Conventional vehicle controllers struggle to manage this scenario, necessitating the use of a drifting controller. However, the large sideslip angle in drift conditions introduces model mismatch, which in turn affects control precision. To address this issue, we propose a model correction drift controller that integrates Model Predictive Control (MPC) with Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). GPR is employed to correct vehicle model mismatches during both drift equilibrium solving and the MPC optimization process. Additionally, the variance from GPR is utilized to actively explore different cornering drifting velocities, aiming to minimize trajectory tracking errors. The proposed algorithm is validated through simulations on the Simulink-Carsim platform and experiments with a 1:10 scale RC vehicle. In the simulation, the average lateral error with GPR is reduced by 52.8% compared to the non-GPR case. Incorporating exploration further decreases this error by 27.1%. The velocity tracking Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) also decreases by 10.6% with exploration. In the RC car experiment, the average lateral error with GPR is 36.7% lower, and exploration further leads to a 29.0% reduction. Moreover, the velocity tracking RMSE decreases by 7.2% with the inclusion of exploration.

Title: Neural Predictor for Flight Control with Payload
Authors: Ao Jin, Chenhao Li, Qinyi Wang, Ya Liu, Panfeng Huang, Fan Zhang
Abstract: Aerial robotics for transporting suspended payloads as the form of freely-floating manipulator are growing great interest in recent years. However, the force/torque caused by payload and residual dynamics will introduce unmodeled perturbations to the aerial robotics, which negatively affects the closed-loop performance. Different from estimation-like methods, this paper proposes Neural Predictor, a learning-based approach to model force/torque induced by payload and residual dynamics as a dynamical system. It yields a hybrid model that combines the first-principles dynamics with the learned dynamics. The hybrid model is then integrated into a MPC framework to improve closed-loop performance. Effectiveness of proposed framework is verified extensively in both numerical simulations and real-world flight experiments. The results indicate that our approach can capture force/torque caused by suspended payload and residual dynamics accurately, respond quickly to the changes of them and improve the closed-loop performance significantly. In particular, Neural Predictor outperforms a state-of-the-art learning-based estimator and has reduced the force and torque estimation errors by up to 66.15% and 33.33% while requiring less samples. The code of proposed Neural Predictor can be found at this https URL.

Title: Finite-Alphabet-Aware Trajectory and Precoder Optimization for UAV Relaying
Authors: Haoyang Di, Xiaodong Zhu, Yulin Shao
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become key enablers in relay-assisted wireless communications thanks to their flexibility and line-of-sight channel advantage. However, most existing trajectory optimization frameworks assume ideal Gaussian inputs, overlooking the fact that practical wireless systems rely on structured, finite-alphabet constellations. This mismatch can lead to suboptimal, and sometimes misleading, design choices. In this paper, we challenge that convention by introducing a finite-alphabet-aware framework for joint trajectory and precoder optimization in UAV-assisted relay systems. We formulate a non-convex design problem that directly accounts for discrete signal structures and propose an efficient solution based on alternating optimization and successive convex approximation. Simulation results reveal that strategies optimized under Gaussian assumptions can waste energy and degrade throughput in real deployments. In contrast, our approach adapts both the UAV's trajectory and transmission strategy to the underlying modulation format, delivering consistent performance gains under practical system constraints. This work takes a key step toward aligning UAV communication design with the realities of modern wireless systems: discrete signals, power limits, and intelligent mobility.

Title: DGSNA: prompt-based Dynamic Generative Scene-based Noise Addition method
Authors: Zihao Chen, Zhentao Lin, Bi Zeng, Linyi Huang, Zhi Li, Jia Cai
Abstract: To ensure the reliable operation of speech systems across diverse environments, noise addition methods have emerged as the prevailing solution. However, existing methods offer limited coverage of real-world noisy scenes and depend on pre-existing scene-based information and noise. This paper presents prompt-based Dynamic Generative Scene-based Noise Addition (DGSNA), a novel noise addition methodology that integrates Dynamic Generation of Scene-based Information (DGSI) with Scene-based Noise Addition for Speech (SNAS). This integration facilitates automated scene-based noise addition by transforming clean speech into various noise environments, thereby providing a more comprehensive and realistic simulation of diverse noise conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that DGSNA significantly enhances the robustness of speech recognition and keyword spotting models across various noise conditions, achieving a relative improvement of up to 11.21%. Furthermore, DGSNA can be effectively integrated with other noise addition methods to enhance performance. Our implementation and demonstrations are available at this https URL.

Title: Carbon-Aware Quality Adaptation for Energy-Intensive Services
Authors: Philipp Wiesner, Dennis Grinwald, Philipp Weiß, Patrick Wilhelm, Ramin Khalili, Odej Kao
Abstract: The energy demand of modern cloud services, particularly those related to generative AI, is increasing at an unprecedented pace. To date, carbon-aware computing strategies have primarily focused on batch process scheduling or geo-distributed load balancing. However, such approaches are not applicable to services that require constant availability at specific locations due to latency, privacy, data, or infrastructure constraints. In this paper, we explore how the carbon footprint of energy-intensive services can be reduced by adjusting the fraction of requests served by different service quality tiers. We show that adapting this quality of responses with respect to grid carbon intensity can lead to additional carbon savings beyond resource and energy efficiency and introduce a forecast-based multi-horizon optimization that reaches close-to-optimal carbon savings.

Title: Connecting the Unconnectable through Feedback
Authors: Yimeng Li, Yulin Shao
Abstract: Reliable uplink connectivity remains a persistent challenge for IoT devices, particularly those at the cell edge, due to their limited transmit power and single-antenna configurations. This paper introduces a novel framework aimed at connecting the unconnectable, leveraging real-time feedback from access points (APs) to enhance uplink coverage without increasing the energy consumption of IoT devices. At the core of this approach are feedback channel codes, which enable IoT devices to dynamically adapt their transmission strategies based on AP decoding feedback, thereby reducing the critical uplink SNR required for successful communication. Analytical models are developed to quantify the coverage probability and the number of connectable APs, providing a comprehensive understanding of the system's performance. Numerical results validate the proposed method, demonstrating substantial improvements in coverage range and connectivity, particularly for devices at the cell edge, with up to a 51% boost in connectable APs. Our approach offers a robust and energy-efficient solution to overcoming uplink coverage limitations, enabling IoT networks to connect devices in challenging environments.

Title: Estimation-Aware Trajectory Optimization with Set-Valued Measurement Uncertainties
Authors: Aditya Deole, Mehran Mesbahi
Abstract: In this paper, an optimization-based framework for generating estimation-aware trajectories is presented. In this setup, measurement (output) uncertainties are state-dependent and set-valued. Enveloping ellipsoids are employed to characterize state-dependent uncertainties with unknown distributions. The concept of regularity for set-valued output maps is then introduced, facilitating the formulation of the estimation-aware trajectory generation problem. Specifically, it is demonstrated that for output-regular maps, one can utilize a set-valued observability measure that is concave with respect to the finite horizon state trajectories. By maximizing this measure, estimation-aware trajectories can then be synthesized for a broad class of systems. Trajectory planning routines are also examined in this work, by which the observability measure is optimized for systems with locally linearized dynamics. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, representative examples in the context of trajectory planning with vision-based estimation are presented. Moreover, the paper presents estimation-aware planning for an uncooperative Target-Rendezvous problem, where an Ego-satellite employs an onboard machine learning (ML)-based estimation module to realize the rendezvous trajectory.

Title: AudioMiXR: Spatial Audio Object Manipulation with 6DoF for Sound Design in Augmented Reality
Authors: Brandon Woodard, Margarita Geleta, Joseph J. LaViola Jr., Andrea Fanelli, Rhonda Wilson
Abstract: We present AudioMiXR, an augmented reality (AR) interface intended to assess how users manipulate virtual audio objects situated in their physical space using six degrees of freedom (6DoF) deployed on a head-mounted display (Apple Vision Pro) for 3D sound design. Existing tools for 3D sound design are typically constrained to desktop displays, which may limit spatial awareness of mixing within the execution environment. Utilizing an XR HMD to create soundscapes may provide a real-time test environment for 3D sound design, as modern HMDs can provide precise spatial localization assisted by cross-modal interactions. However, there is no research on design guidelines specific to sound design with six degrees of freedom (6DoF) in XR. To provide a first step toward identifying design-related research directions in this space, we conducted an exploratory study where we recruited 27 participants, consisting of expert and non-expert sound designers. The goal was to assess design lessons that can be used to inform future research venues in 3D sound design. We ran a within-subjects study where users designed both a music and cinematic soundscapes. After thematically analyzing participant data, we constructed two design lessons: 1. Proprioception for AR Sound Design, and 2. Balancing Audio-Visual Modalities in AR GUIs. Additionally, we provide application domains that can benefit most from 6DoF sound design based on our results.

Title: Channel Estimation for Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)
Authors: Jian Xiao, Ji Wang, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: Pinching Antennas (PAs) represent a revolutionary flexible antenna technology that leverages dielectric waveguides and electromagnetic coupling to mitigate large-scale path loss. This letter is the first to explore channel estimation for Pinching-Antenna SyStems (PASS), addressing their uniquely ill-conditioned and underdetermined channel characteristics. In particular, two efficient deep learning-based channel estimators are proposed. 1) PAMoE: This estimator incorporates dynamic padding, feature embedding, fusion, and mixture of experts (MoE) modules, which effectively leverage the positional information of PAs and exploit expert diversity. 2) PAformer: This Transformer-style estimator employs the self-attention mechanism to predict channel coefficients in a per-antenna manner, which offers more flexibility to adaptively deal with dynamic numbers of PAs in practical deployment. Numerical results demonstrate that 1) the proposed deep learning-based channel estimators outperform conventional methods and exhibit excellent zero-shot learning capabilities, and 2) PAMoE delivers higher channel estimation accuracy via MoE specialization, while PAformer natively handles an arbitrary number of PAs, trading self-attention complexity for superior scalability.

Title: LightSNN: Lightweight Architecture Search for Sparse and Accurate Spiking Neural Networks
Authors: Yesmine Abdennadher, Giovanni Perin, Riccardo Mazzieri, Jacopo Pegoraro, Michele Rossi
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are highly regarded for their energy efficiency, inherent activation sparsity, and suitability for real-time processing in edge devices. However, most current SNN methods adopt architectures resembling traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), leading to suboptimal performance when applied to SNNs. While SNNs excel in energy efficiency, they have been associated with lower accuracy levels than traditional ANNs when utilizing conventional architectures. In response, in this work we present LightSNN, a rapid and efficient Neural Network Architecture Search (NAS) technique specifically tailored for SNNs that autonomously leverages the most suitable architecture, striking a good balance between accuracy and efficiency by enforcing sparsity. Based on the spiking NAS network (SNASNet) framework, a cell-based search space including backward connections is utilized to build our training-free pruning-based NAS mechanism. Our technique assesses diverse spike activation patterns across different data samples using a sparsity-aware Hamming distance fitness evaluation. Thorough experiments are conducted on both static (CIFAR10 and CIFAR100) and neuromorphic datasets (DVS128-Gesture). Our LightSNN model achieves state-of-the-art results on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, improves performance on DVS128Gesture by 4.49\%, and significantly reduces search time most notably offering a $98\times$ speedup over SNASNet and running 30\% faster than the best existing method on DVS128Gesture.

Title: Enhancing Wide-Angle Image Using Narrow-Angle View of the Same Scene
Authors: Hussain Md. Safwan, Mahbub Islam Mahim
Abstract: A common dilemma while photographing a scene is whether to capture it at a wider angle, allowing more of the scene to be covered but in less detail or to click in a narrow angle that captures better details but leaves out portions of the scene. We propose a novel method in this paper that infuses wider shots with finer quality details that is usually associated with an image captured by the primary lens by capturing the same scene using both narrow and wide field of view (FoV) lenses. We do so by training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based model to learn to extract the visual quality parameters from a narrow-angle shot and to transfer these to the corresponding wide-angle image of the scene using residual connections and an attention-based fusion module. We have mentioned in details the proposed technique to isolate the visual essence of an image and to transfer it into another image. We have also elaborately discussed our implementation details and have presented the results of evaluation over several benchmark datasets and comparisons with contemporary advancements in the field.

Title: Near-optimal Sensor Placement for Detecting Stochastic Target Trajectories in Barrier Coverage Systems
Authors: Mingyu Kim, Daniel J. Stilwell, Harun Yetkin, Jorge Jimenez
Abstract: This paper addresses the deployment of sensors for a 2-D barrier coverage system. The challenge is to compute near-optimal sensor placements for detecting targets whose trajectories follow a log-Gaussian Cox line process. We explore sensor deployment in a transformed space, where linear target trajectories are represented as points. While this space simplifies handling the line process, the spatial functions representing sensor performance (i.e. probability of detection) become less intuitive. To illustrate our approach, we focus on positioning sensors of the barrier coverage system on the seafloor to detect passing ships. Through numerical experiments using historical ship data, we compute sensor locations that maximize the probability all ship passing over the barrier coverage system are detected.

Title: Accelerated Decentralized Constraint-Coupled Optimization: A Dual$^2$ Approach
Authors: Jingwang Li, Vincent Lau
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on a class of decentralized constraint-coupled optimization problem: $\min_{x_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d_i}, i \in \mathcal{I}; y \in \mathbb{R}^p}$ $\sum_{i=1}^n\left(f_i(x_i) + g_i(x_i)\right) + h(y) \ \text{s.t.} \ \sum_{i=1}^{n}A_ix_i = y$, over an undirected and connected network of $n$ agents. Here, $f_i$, $g_i$, and $A_i$ represent private information of agent $i \in \mathcal{I} = \{1, \cdots, n\}$, while $h$ is public for all agents. Building on a novel dual$^2$ approach, we develop two accelerated algorithms to solve this problem: the inexact Dual$^2$ Accelerated (iD2A) gradient method and the Multi-consensus inexact Dual$^2$ Accelerated (MiD2A) gradient method. We demonstrate that both iD2A and MiD2A can guarantee asymptotic convergence under a milder condition on $h$ compared to existing algorithms. Furthermore, under additional assumptions, we establish linear convergence rates and derive significantly lower communication and computational complexity bounds than those of existing algorithms. Several numerical experiments validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the practical superiority of the proposed algorithms.

Title: Particle Gibbs without the Gibbs bit
Authors: Adrien Corenflos
Abstract: Exact parameter and trajectory inference in state-space models is typically achieved by one of two methods: particle marginal Metropolis-Hastings (PMMH) or particle Gibbs (PGibbs). PMMH is a pseudo-marginal algorithm which jointly proposes a new trajectory and parameter, and accepts or rejects both at once. PGibbs instead alternates between sampling from the trajectory, using an algorithm known as conditional sequential Monte Carlo (CSMC) and the parameter in a Hastings-within-Gibbs fashion. While particle independent Metropolis Hastings (PIMH), the parameter-free version of PMMH, is known to be statistically worse than CSMC, PGibbs can induce a slow mixing if the parameter and the state trajectory are very correlated. This has made PMMH the method of choice for many practitioners, despite theory and experiments favouring CSMC over PIMH for the parameter-free problem. In this article, we describe a formulation of PGibbs which bypasses the Gibbs step, essentially marginalizing over the trajectory distribution in a fashion similar to PMMH. This is achieved by considering the implementation of a CSMC algortihm for the state-space model integrated over the joint distribution of the current parameter and the parameter proposal. We illustrate the benefits of method on a simple example known to be challenging for PMMH.

Title: Fluid Antenna-Assisted MU-MIMO Systems with Decentralized Baseband Processing
Authors: Tianyi Liao, Wei Guo, Hengtao He, Shenghui Song, Jun Zhang, Khaled B. Letaief
Abstract: The fluid antenna system (FAS) has emerged as a disruptive technology, offering unprecedented degrees of freedom (DoF) for wireless communication systems. However, optimizing fluid antenna (FA) positions entails significant computational costs, especially when the number of FAs is large. To address this challenge, we introduce a decentralized baseband processing (DBP) architecture to FAS, which partitions the FA array into clusters and enables parallel processing. Based on the DBP architecture, we formulate a weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem through joint beamforming and FA position design for FA-assisted multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. To solve the WSR maximization problem, we propose a novel decentralized block coordinate ascent (BCA)-based algorithm that leverages matrix fractional programming (FP) and majorization-minimization (MM) methods. The proposed decentralized algorithm achieves low computational, communication, and storage costs, thus unleashing the potential of the DBP architecture. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm under the DBP architecture reduces computational time by over 70% compared to centralized architectures with negligible WSR performance loss.

Title: Learning to Drive Anywhere with Model-Based Reannotation
Authors: Noriaki Hirose, Lydia Ignatova, Kyle Stachowicz, Catherine Glossop, Sergey Levine, Dhruv Shah
Abstract: Developing broadly generalizable visual navigation policies for robots is a significant challenge, primarily constrained by the availability of large-scale, diverse training data. While curated datasets collected by researchers offer high quality, their limited size restricts policy generalization. To overcome this, we explore leveraging abundant, passively collected data sources, including large volumes of crowd-sourced teleoperation data and unlabeled YouTube videos, despite their potential for lower quality or missing action labels. We propose Model-Based ReAnnotation (MBRA), a framework that utilizes a learned short-horizon, model-based expert model to relabel or generate high-quality actions for these passive datasets. This relabeled data is then distilled into LogoNav, a long-horizon navigation policy conditioned on visual goals or GPS waypoints. We demonstrate that LogoNav, trained using MBRA-processed data, achieves state-of-the-art performance, enabling robust navigation over distances exceeding 300 meters in previously unseen indoor and outdoor environments. Our extensive real-world evaluations, conducted across a fleet of robots (including quadrupeds) in six cities on three continents, validate the policy's ability to generalize and navigate effectively even amidst pedestrians in crowded settings.
