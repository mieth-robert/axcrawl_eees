Title: RIR-Mega: a large-scale simulated room impulse response dataset for machine learning and room acoustics modeling
Authors: Mandip Goswami
Abstract: Room impulse responses are a core resource for dereverberation, robust speech recognition, source localization, and room acoustics estimation. We present RIR-Mega, a large collection of simulated RIRs described by a compact, machine friendly metadata schema and distributed with simple tools for validation and reuse. The dataset ships with a Hugging Face Datasets loader, scripts for metadata checks and checksums, and a reference regression baseline that predicts RT60 like targets from waveforms. On a train and validation split of 36,000 and 4,000 examples, a small Random Forest on lightweight time and spectral features reaches a mean absolute error near 0.013 s and a root mean square error near 0.022 s. We host a subset with 1,000 linear array RIRs and 3,000 circular array RIRs on Hugging Face for streaming and quick tests, and preserve the complete 50,000 RIR archive on Zenodo. The dataset and code are public to support reproducible studies.

Title: StutterZero and StutterFormer: End-to-End Speech Conversion for Stuttering Transcription and Correction
Authors: Qianheng Xu
Abstract: Over 70 million people worldwide experience stuttering, yet most automatic speech systems misinterpret disfluent utterances or fail to transcribe them accurately. Existing methods for stutter correction rely on handcrafted feature extraction or multi-stage automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) pipelines, which separate transcription from audio reconstruction and often amplify distortions. This work introduces StutterZero and StutterFormer, the first end-to-end waveform-to-waveform models that directly convert stuttered speech into fluent speech while jointly predicting its transcription. StutterZero employs a convolutional-bidirectional LSTM encoder-decoder with attention, whereas StutterFormer integrates a dual-stream Transformer with shared acoustic-linguistic representations. Both architectures are trained on paired stuttered-fluent data synthesized from the SEP-28K and LibriStutter corpora and evaluated on unseen speakers from the FluencyBank dataset. Across all benchmarks, StutterZero had a 24% decrease in Word Error Rate (WER) and a 31% improvement in semantic similarity (BERTScore) compared to the leading Whisper-Medium model. StutterFormer achieved better results, with a 28% decrease in WER and a 34% improvement in BERTScore. The results validate the feasibility of direct end-to-end stutter-to-fluent speech conversion, offering new opportunities for inclusive human-computer interaction, speech therapy, and accessibility-oriented AI systems.

Title: AI-Aided Annealed Langevin Dynamics for Rapid Optimization of Programmable Channels
Authors: Tomer Shaked, Philipp del Hougne, George C. Alexandropoulos, Nir Shlezinger
Abstract: Emerging technologies such as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) make it possible to optimize some parameters of wireless channels. Conventional approaches require relating the channel and its programmable parameters via a simple model that supports rapid optimization, e.g., re-tuning the parameters each time the users move. However, in practice such models are often crude approximations of the channel, and a more faithful description can be obtained via complex simulators, or only by measurements. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for rapid optimization of programmable channels based on AI-aided Annealed Langevin Dynamics (ALD), which bypasses the need for explicit channel modeling. By framing the ALD algorithm using the MAP estimate, we design a deep unfolded ALD algorithm that leverages a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to estimate score gradients for optimizing channel parameters. We introduce a training method that overcomes the need for channel modeling using zero-order gradients, combined with active learning to enhance generalization, enabling optimization in complex and dynamically changing environments. We evaluate the proposed method in RIS-aided scenarios subject to rich-scattering effects. Our results demonstrate that our AI-aided ALD method enables rapid and reliable channel parameter tuning with limited latency.

Title: Active Cooling Device: A Flexible, Lab-Scale Experimental Unit to Develop Spatio-Temporal Temperature Control Strategies
Authors: Victor Oliveira Ferreira, Wiebke Mainville, Vincent Raymond, Jean-Michel Lamarre, Antoine Hamel, Mikael Vaillant, Moncef Chioua, Bruno Blais
Abstract: We present an experimental unit that realizes the ``multi-input, multi-output manifold'' thermal management technology proposed by Lamarre & Raymond (2023). The proposed setup can be used for experiments aimed at controlling spatiotemporal temperature distribution. Temperature control is achieved by impinging coolant fluid jets, leveraging a manifold of channels targeted to the surface. The direction of the fluid is controlled by shifting the role of channels between inputs, outputs, or closing them. Files associated with this work include Computer-Aided Design (CAD) STEP files, Gerber files to manufacture a Printed Circuit Board (PCB), and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) written in Python. We provide a step-by-step guide to assemble the experimental setup. We also provide instructions to interact with the setup through the GUI, which allows for real-time tracking of sample temperature and flow rates per flow control device. Additionally, we provide examples of usage of the setup, including system characterization with step response, Proportional-Integral-Derivative performance tracking, and disturbance rejection in a coupled system. Extending the application is accessible through the files provided in the open repository associated with this work. The active cooling device presents a safe, flexible, and complete design, allowing for lab-scale assessment of the performance of custom temperature control strategies using enclosed impinging jets.

Title: Fundamental Limits of Cooperative Integrated Sensing and Communications over Low-Earth Orbit THz Satellite Channels
Authors: Haofan Dong, Houtianfu Wang, Hanlin Cai, Ozgur B. Akan
Abstract: Terahertz inter-satellite links enable unprecedented sensing precision for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations, yet face fundamental bounds from hardware impairments, pointing errors, and network interference. We develop a Network Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (N-CRLB) framework incorporating dynamic topology, hardware quality factor $\Gamma_{\text{eff}}$, phase noise $\sigma^2_\phi$, and cooperative effects through recursive Fisher Information analysis. Our analysis reveals three key insights: (i) hardware and phase noise create power-independent performance ceilings ($\sigma_{\text{ceiling}} \propto \sqrt{\Gamma_{\text{eff}}}$) and floors ($\sigma_{\text{floor}} \propto \sqrt{\sigma^2_\phi}/f_c$), with power-only scaling saturating above $\text{SNR}_{\text{crit}}=1/\Gamma_{\text{eff}}$; (ii) interference coefficients $\alpha_{\ell m}$ enable opportunistic sensing with demonstrated gains of 5.5~dB under specific conditions (65~dB processing gain, 50~dBi antennas); (iii) measurement correlations from shared timing references, when properly modeled, do not degrade performance and can provide common-mode rejection benefits compared to mismodeled independent-noise baselines. Sub-millimeter ranging requires co-optimized hardware ($\Gamma_{\text{eff}}<0.01$), oscillators ($\sigma^2_\phi<10^{-2}$), and appropriate 3D geometry configurations.

Title: Extreme value distributions of peak loads for non-residential customer segments
Authors: Shaohong Shi, Eric A. Cator, Jacco Heres, Simon H. Tindemans
Abstract: Electrical grid congestion is a growing challenge in Europe, driving the need for accurate prediction of load, particularly of peak load. Non-time-resolved models of peak load offer the advantages of simplicity and compactness, and among them, Velander's formula (VF) is a traditional method that has been used for decades. Moreover, VF can be adapted into a quantile VF, which learns a truncated cumulative distribution function of peak load based on electricity consumption. This paper proposes a mathematical model based on extreme value theory to characterize the probability distribution of peak load for large non-residential customers. The model underpins the quantile VF as demonstrated through multiple quantile regression and reduces its representation to just four parameters without sacrificing predictive performance. Moreover, using maximum likelihood estimation and the likelihood ratio test, we validate that the probability distribution of peak load of analysed groups belongs to the heavy-tailed Fréchet class.

Title: Macroscopic EEG Reveals Discriminative Low-Frequency Oscillations in Plan-to-Grasp Visuomotor Tasks
Authors: Anna Cetera, Sima Ghafoori, Ali Rabiee, Mohammad Hassan Farhadi, Yalda Shahriari, Reza Abiri
Abstract: The vision-based grasping brain network integrates visual perception with cognitive and motor processes for visuomotor tasks. While invasive recordings have successfully decoded localized neural activity related to grasp type planning and execution, macroscopic neural activation patterns captured by noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) remain far less understood. We introduce a novel vision-based grasping platform to investigate grasp-type-specific (precision, power, no-grasp) neural activity across large-scale brain networks using EEG neuroimaging. The platform isolates grasp-specific planning from its associated execution phases in naturalistic visuomotor tasks, where the Filter-Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) technique was designed to extract discriminative frequency-specific features within each phase. Support vector machine (SVM) classification discriminated binary (precision vs. power, grasp vs. no-grasp) and multiclass (precision vs. power vs. no-grasp) scenarios for each phase, and were compared against traditional Movement-Related Cortical Potential (MRCP) methods. Low-frequency oscillations (0.5-8 Hz) carry grasp-related information established during planning and maintained throughout execution, with consistent classification performance across both phases (75.3-77.8\%) for precision vs. power discrimination, compared to 61.1\% using MRCP. Higher-frequency activity (12-40 Hz) showed phase-dependent results with 93.3\% accuracy for grasp vs. no-grasp classification but 61.2\% for precision vs. power discrimination. Feature importance using SVM coefficients identified discriminative features within frontoparietal networks during planning and motor networks during execution. This work demonstrated the role of low-frequency oscillations in decoding grasp type during planning using noninvasive EEG.

Title: Graph Analysis to Fully Automate Fault Location Identification in Power Distribution Systems
Authors: Ali Shakeri Kahnamouei, Saeed Lotfifard
Abstract: This paper proposes graph analysis methods to fully automate the fault location identification task in power distribution systems. The proposed methods take basic unordered data from power distribution systems as input, including branch parameters, load values, and the location of measuring devices. The proposed data preparation and analysis methods automatically identify the system's topology and extract essential information, such as faulted paths, structures, loading of laterals and sublaterals, and estimate the fault location accordingly. The proposed graph analysis methods do not require complex node and branch numbering processes or renumbering following changes in the system topology. The proposed methods eliminate the need for human intervention at any step of the fault location identification process. They are scalable and applicable to systems of any size. The performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated using the IEEE 34-bus distribution test system.

Title: Time Domain Differential Equation Based Fault Location Identification in Mixed Overhead-Underground Power Distribution Systems
Authors: Ali Shakeri Kahnamouei, Saeed Lotfifard
Abstract: This paper proposes a time-domain fault location identification method for mixed overhead-underground power distribution systems that can handle challenging fault scenarios such as sub-cycle faults, arcing faults and evolving faults. The proposed method is formulated based on differential equations of the system and accounts for the peculiarities of power distribution systems with distributed generations. It considers the presence of loads, multi-phase laterals and sub-laterals, heterogenous overhead and underground lines, and infeeds and remote-end fault current contributions of distributed generations. It utilizes data collected by limited number of measuring devices installed in modern power distribution systems to systematically eliminate possible multiple fault location estimations to provide a single correct estimation of the actual location of the fault. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated using IEEE 34-node test system.

Title: A Configurable Simulation Framework for Safety Assessment of Vulnerable Road Users
Authors: Zhitong He, Yaobin Chen, Brian King, Lingxi Li
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs), including pedestrians, cyclists, electric scooter riders, and motorcyclists, remains a major challenge for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and connected and automated vehicles (CAV) technologies. Real-world VRU tests are expensive and sometimes cannot capture or repeat rare and hazardous events. In this paper, we present a lightweight, configurable simulation framework that follows European New Car Assessment Program (Euro NCAP) VRU testing protocols. A rule-based finite-state machine (FSM) is developed as a motion planner to provide vehicle automation during the VRU interaction. We also integrate ego-vehicle perception and idealized Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) awareness to demonstrate safety margins in different scenarios. This work provides an extensible platform for rapid and repeatable VRU safety validation, paving the way for broader case-study deployment in diverse, user-defined settings, which will be essential for building a more VRU-friendly and sustainable intelligent transportation system.

Title: Auditory Attention Decoding from Ear-EEG Signals: A Dataset with Dynamic Attention Switching and Rigorous Cross-Validation
Authors: Yuanming Zhang, Zeyan Song, Jing Lu, Fei Chen, Zhibin Lin
Abstract: Recent promising results in auditory attention decoding (AAD) using scalp electroencephalography (EEG) have motivated the exploration of cEEGrid, a flexible and portable ear-EEG system. While prior cEEGrid-based studies have confirmed the feasibility of AAD, they often neglect the dynamic nature of attentional states in real-world contexts. To address this gap, a novel cEEGrid dataset featuring three concurrent speakers distributed across three of five distinct spatial locations is introduced. The novel dataset is designed to probe attentional tracking and switching in realistic scenarios. Nested leave-one-out validation-an approach more rigorous than conventional single-loop leave-one-out validation-is employed to reduce biases stemming from EEG's intricate temporal dynamics. Four rule-based models are evaluated: Wiener filter (WF), canonical component analysis (CCA), common spatial pattern (CSP) and Riemannian Geometry-based classifier (RGC). With a 30-second decision window, WF and CCA models achieve decoding accuracies of 41.5% and 41.4%, respectively, while CSP and RGC models yield 37.8% and 37.6% accuracies using a 10-second window. Notably, both WF and CCA successfully track attentional state switches across all experimental tasks. Additionally, higher decoding accuracies are observed for electrodes positioned at the upper cEEGrid layout and near the listener's right ear. These findings underscore the utility of dynamic, ecologically valid paradigms and rigorous validation in advancing AAD research with cEEGrid.

Title: AI Signal Processing Paradigm for Movable Antenna: From Geometric Optimization to Electromagnetic Reconfigurability
Authors: Yining Li, Ziwei Wan, Chongjia Sun, Kaijun Feng, Keke Ying, Wenyan Ma, Lipeng Zhu, Xiaodan Shao, Zhenyu Xiao, Zhen Gao
Abstract: As 6G wireless communication systems evolve toward intelligence and high reconfigurability, the limitations of traditional fixed antenna (TFA) has become increasingly prominent, with geometrically movable antenna (GMA) and electromagnetically reconfigurable antenna (ERA) emerging as key technologies to break through this bottleneck. GMA activates spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) by dynamically adjusting antenna positions, ERA regulates radiation characteristics using tunable metamaterials, thereby introducing DoF in the electromagnetic domain. However, the ``geometric-electromagnetic dual reconfiguration" paradigm formed by their integration poses severe challenges of high-dimensional hybrid optimization to signal processing. To address this issue, we integrate the geometric optimization of GMA and the electromagnetic reconfiguration of ERA for the first time, propose a unified modeling framework for movable and reconfigurable antenna (MARA), investigate the channel modeling and spectral efficiency (SE) optimization for GMA, ERA, and MARA. Besides, we systematically review artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions, focusing on analyzing the advantages of AI over traditional algorithms in high-dimensional non-convex optimization computations. This paper fills the gap in existing literature regarding the lack of a comprehensive review on the AI-driven signal processing paradigm under geometric-electromagnetic dual reconfiguration and provides theoretical support for the design and optimization of 6G wireless systems with high SE and flexibility.

Title: Spatiotemporal Tubes based Control of Unknown Multi-Agent Systems for Temporal Reach-Avoid-Stay Tasks
Authors: Ahan Basu, Ratnangshu Das, Pushpak Jagtap
Abstract: The paper focuses on designing a controller for unknown dynamical multi-agent systems to achieve temporal reach-avoid-stay tasks for each agent while preventing inter-agent collisions. The main objective is to generate a spatiotemporal tube (STT) for each agent and thereby devise a closed-form, approximation-free, and decentralized control strategy that ensures the system trajectory reaches the target within a specific time while avoiding time-varying unsafe sets and collisions with other agents. In order to achieve this, the requirements of STTs are formulated as a robust optimization problem (ROP) and solved using a sampling-based scenario optimization problem (SOP) to address the issue of infeasibility caused by the infinite number of constraints in ROP. The STTs are generated by solving the SOP, and the corresponding closed-form control is designed to fulfill the specified task. Finally, the effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through two case studies, one involving omnidirectional robots and the other involving multiple drones modelled as Euler-Lagrange systems.

Title: TinyUSFM: Towards Compact and Efficient Ultrasound Foundation Models
Authors: Chen Ma, Jing Jiao, Shuyu Liang, Junhu Fu, Qin Wang, Zeju Li, Yuanyuan Wang, Yi Guo
Abstract: Foundation models for medical imaging demonstrate superior generalization capabilities across diverse anatomical structures and clinical applications. Their outstanding performance relies on substantial computational resources, limiting deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. This paper presents TinyUSFM, the first lightweight ultrasound foundation model that maintains superior organ versatility and task adaptability of our large-scale Ultrasound Foundation Model (USFM) through knowledge distillation with strategically curated small datasets, delivering significant computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. Considering the limited capacity and representation ability of lightweight models, we propose a feature-gradient driven coreset selection strategy to curate high-quality compact training data, avoiding training degradation from low-quality redundant images. To preserve the essential spatial and frequency domain characteristics during knowledge transfer, we develop domain-separated masked image modeling assisted consistency-driven dynamic distillation. This novel framework adaptively transfers knowledge from large foundation models by leveraging teacher model consistency across different domain masks, specifically tailored for ultrasound interpretation. For evaluation, we establish the UniUS-Bench, the largest publicly available ultrasound benchmark comprising 8 classification and 10 segmentation datasets across 15 organs. Using only 200K images in distillation, TinyUSFM matches USFM's performance with just 6.36% of parameters and 6.40% of GFLOPs. TinyUSFM significantly outperforms the vanilla model by 9.45% in classification and 7.72% in segmentation, surpassing all state-of-the-art lightweight models, and achieving 84.91% average classification accuracy and 85.78% average segmentation Dice score across diverse medical devices and centers.

Title: Generalized Modified Blake-Zisserman Robust Spline Adaptive Filter for Generalized Gaussian Noise
Authors: Haiquan Zhao, Bei Xu
Abstract: The spline adaptive filtering (SAF) algorithm-based information-theoretic learning has exhibited strong convergence performance in nonlinear system identification (NSI), establishing SAF as a promising framework for adaptive filtering. However, existing SAF-based methods suffer from performance degradation under generalized Gaussian noise (GGN) environment and exhibit significant steady-state misalignment under impulse noise. Moreover, prior research on SAF algorithms has not effectively addressed the adverse effects caused by outliers. To overcome these challenges, the generalized modified Blake-Zisserman robust spline adaptive filtering (SAF-GMBZ) algorithm is proposed. Compared to conventional SAF algorithms, SAF-GMBZ exhibits superior learning performance in GGN. Furthermore, the mean convergence ranges of the step-sizes and the steady-state mean-square error (MSE) are calculated by introducing the commonly utilized assumptions. To arrive at good convergence accuracy and noise cancellation capability in active noise control (ANC) application, the filter-c GMBZ (FcGMBZ) algorithm is further developed based on SAF-GMBZ. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the theoretical steady-state MSE, and the superiority of the SAF-GMBZ algorithm under GGN environment in NSI, along with the effectiveness of the FcGMBZ algorithm in ANC application under impulsive noise environment.

Title: A Study on Delay Assessment for Heterogenous Traffic in VANET
Authors: Shama Siddiqu, Indrakshi Dey
Abstract: Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) comprise of multi-priority hetero-genous nodes, both stationary and/or mobile. The data generated by these nodes may include messages relating to information, safety, entertainment, traffic management and emergency alerts. The data in the network needs dif-ferentiated service based on the priority/urgency. Media Access Control (MAC) protocols hold a significant value for managing the data priority. This paper studies a comparison of 802.11p which is a standard PHY and MAC protocol for VANET with a fragmentation-based protocol, FROG-MAC. The major design principle of 802.11-p is to allow direct Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication without associa-tion, using Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) to prioritize safety-critical messages. However, if non-critical messages already start to transmit, the nodes with critical data have to wait. FROG-MAC reduces this delay by transmitting normal packets in fragments with short pauses between them, al-lowing urgent packets to access the channel during these intervals. Simula-tions have been performed to assess the delay and throughput for high and low priority data. We report that FROG-MAC improves both the performance parameters due to offering an early channel access to the emergency traffic.

Title: IoT-Enabled Sleep Monitoring and Cognitive Assessment for Evaluating Teacher Well-Being
Authors: Anwar Ahmed Khan, Shama Siddiqui, Mehar Ullah, Indrakshi Dey
Abstract: Sleep quality is an important indicator of the efficient cognitive function for high school teachers. Due to the high work stress and multi-tasking expectations, the teachers often face issues with their sleep quality and cognitive function, which has a clearly negative influence on their teaching abilities. In this work, we propose a unique but simple method of deploying Internet of Things (IoT) technology to monitor the sleep quality of high school teachers at Pakistan. Smart watches embedded with pulse rate and SpO2 sensors were used to collect data and categorize the sleep quality as "poor", "fair" or "good". Moreover, we used a psychological tool, Cognitive Assessment Questionnaire (CAQ) for the self-assessment of teachers' cognitive function. The study was conducted over 208 high school teachers from across Pakistan. It has been found that most of the teachers had a poor sleep quality and cognitive function; The link between these two variables indicate that the workload and other factors must be improved for the teachers to ensure their well-being, which will in turn have a positive impact on their teaching quality.

Title: Managing Charging Induced Grid Stress and Battery Degradation in Electric Taxi Fleets
Authors: Michael Yuhas, Rajesh K. Ahir, Laksamana Vixell Tanjaya Hartono, Muhammad Dzaki Dwi Putranto, Arvind Easwaran, Suhono Harso Supangkat
Abstract: Operating fleets of electric vehicles (EVs) introduces several challenges, some of which are borne by the fleet operator, and some of which are borne by the power grid. To maximize short-term profit a fleet operator could always charge EVs at the maximum rate to ensure vehicles are ready to service ride demand. However, due to the stochastic nature of electricity demand, charging EVs at their maximum rate may potentially increase the grid stress and lead to overall instability. Furthermore, high-rate charging of EVs can accelerate battery degradation, thereby reducing the service lifespan of the fleet. This study aims to reconcile the conflicting incentives of fleet longevity, short-term profitability, and grid stability by simulating a taxi fleet throughout its lifespan in relation to its charging policies and service conditions. We develop an EV fleet simulator to evaluate the battery degradation due to unpredictable charging and ride demand. Consequently, the impact on the power grid through the charging infrastructure is assessed due to these activities. This simulation utilizes publicly accessible real-world travel data from the NYC taxi dataset. We compare a baseline 80-20 fleet charging policy with a reinforcement learning-based policy designed to prolong the fleet's service life and alleviate grid stress. We monitor grid stress, battery degradation, and profitability over five years and find that our learned policy outperforms the baseline. This simulator enables fleet operators to assess the impact of different charging policies on these indicators to make informed decisions in the future.

Title: Neuromorphic computing for anomaly detection in a laser powder bed fusion process
Authors: Shreyan Banerjee, Aasifa Rounak, Cathal Hoare, Denis Dowling, Vikram Pakrashi
Abstract: This study is the first application of spiking neural networks (SNNs) for anomaly detection in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing process. The neural networks were used to identify print processing anomalies generated by dropping of laser energy during the printing of individual layers in a Ti-6Al-4V alloy lattice structures. Associated changes in the laser generated melt pool were observed using an in-process photodiode monitoring technique. photodiode sensors capturing plasma and infrared radiations reflected from the print bed of the metal 3D printer were utilized to detect sudden changes caused by anomalies during the printing process. The algorithm is first implemented on non-neuromorphic hardware including a central processing unit (CPU), on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) and then on neuromorphic Intel's Loihi chip. Improved detection of anomalies is achieved by adjusting the spike latency of the neural network, which reduces masking of information by noise within the monitored temporal signal. The work demonstrates the possibility of using low-power neuromorphic chips within an edge framework for anomaly detection in additive manufacturing and creates a framework for the process.

Title: An Efficient Neural Network for Modeling Human Auditory Neurograms for Speech
Authors: Eylon Zohar, Israel Nelken, Boaz Rafaely
Abstract: Classical auditory-periphery models, exemplified by Bruce et al., 2018, provide high-fidelity simulations but are stochastic and computationally demanding, limiting large-scale experimentation and low-latency use. Prior neural encoders approximate aspects of the periphery; however, few are explicitly trained to reproduce the deterministic, rate-domain neurogram , hindering like-for-like evaluation. We present a compact convolutional encoder that approximates the Bruce mean-rate pathway and maps audio to a multi-frequency neurogram. We deliberately omit stochastic spiking effects and focus on a deterministic mapping (identical outputs for identical inputs). Using a computationally efficient design, the encoder achieves close correspondence to the reference while significantly reducing computation, enabling efficient modeling and front-end processing for auditory neuroscience and audio signal processing applications.

Title: Multi-code rate Task-Oriented Communication for Multi-Edge Cooperative Inference
Authors: Dongwon Kim, Jiwan Seo, Joonhyuk Kang
Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with the internet of things (IoT) enables task-oriented communication for multi-edge cooperative inference system, where edge devices transmit extracted features of local sensory data to an edge server to perform AI-driven tasks. However, the privacy concerns and limited communication bandwidth pose fundamental challenges, since simultaneous transmission of extracted features with a single fixed compression ratio from all devices leads to severe inefficiency in communication resource utilization. To address this challenge, we propose a framework that dynamically adjusts the code rate in feature extraction based on its importance to the downstream inference task by adopting a rate-adaptive quantization (RAQ) scheme. Furthermore, to select the code rate for each edge device under limited bandwidth constraint, a dynamic programming (DP) approach is leveraged to allocate the code rate across discrete code rate options. Experiments on multi-view datasets demonstrate that the proposed frameworks significantly outperform the frameworks using fixed-rate quantization, achieving a favorable balance between communication efficiency and inference performance under limited bandwidth conditions.

Title: Ray-Tracing Based Narrow-Beam Channel Simulation, Characterization and Performance Evaluation for 5G-R Systems
Authors: Tao Zhou, Liying Geng, Yiqun Liang, Kaifeng Bao, Tianyun Feng, Liu Liu, Bo Ai
Abstract: This paper investigates narrow-beam channel characterization and performance evaluation for 5G for railway (5G-R) systems based on ray-tracing (RT) simulation. Three representative high-speed railway (HSR) scenarios including viaduct, cutting, and station are established, and RT-based dynamic narrow-beam channel simulations are conducted using a designed beam tracking scheme that ensures continuous alignment with the moving train. The channel characteristics are analyzed in terms of both large-scale and small-scale fading, as well as non-stationarity, providing statistical insights into path loss, shadow fading, fading severity, time-frequency-space dispersion, and stationarity interval. The influence of beamwidth on these channel properties is also examined. Furthermore, the performance of 5G-R systems operating in such narrow-beam channels is evaluated using the Vienna 5G simulator, with a focus on block error rate, throughput, and spectral efficiency. A hardware-in-the-loop simulation platform is developed to further assess synchronization signal reference signal received power, signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, and reference signal received quality. The results provide valuable guidance for the design and optimization of 5G-R systems in HSR environments.

Title: A Novel Delay-Doppler Domain Channel Sounding Method for 6G High-Mobility Scenarios
Authors: Kaifeng Bao, Tao Zhou, Chaoyi Li, Liu Liu, Bo Ai
Abstract: Channel measurements are the prerequisite for applying emerging transmission technologies and designing communication systems. In sixth-generation (6G) system, conventional time or frequency domain channel sounding methods cannot directly obtain Doppler information induced by high-mobility scenarios. The channel spreading function (CSF) simultaneously captures delay and Doppler information, while naturally characterizing the propagation environment in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain. However, DD domain channel sounding methods remain underexplored. This paper presents a novel DD domain channel sounding method for 6G high-mobility scenarios. First, we introduce the waveform design for the sounding signal and analyze its sounding capability. Next, the methodology of DD domain channel sounding, including synchronization and CSF estimation, is thoroughly detailed. Additionally, an algorithm for enhancing measurement precision is proposed. The performance of the proposed method is rigorously evaluated. Subsequently, a DD domain channel sounding system competent for 6G high-mobility scenarios is established. Finally, DD domain channel measurements are conducted for a vehicle-to-infrastructure scenario in urban environments. Measurement results, including CSF, power delay profile, Doppler power spectral density, number of multipath components, and other characteristics, are derived, which confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method and offer helpful insights for advancing research on 6G high-mobility communications.

Title: EchoFake: A Replay-Aware Dataset for Practical Speech Deepfake Detection
Authors: Tong Zhang, Yihuan Huang, Yanzhen Ren
Abstract: The growing prevalence of speech deepfakes has raised serious concerns, particularly in real-world scenarios such as telephone fraud and identity theft. While many anti-spoofing systems have demonstrated promising performance on lab-generated synthetic speech, they often fail when confronted with physical replay attacks-a common and low-cost form of attack used in practical settings. Our experiments show that models trained on existing datasets exhibit severe performance degradation, with average accuracy dropping to 59.6% when evaluated on replayed audio. To bridge this gap, we present EchoFake, a comprehensive dataset comprising more than 120 hours of audio from over 13,000 speakers, featuring both cutting-edge zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) speech and physical replay recordings collected under varied devices and real-world environmental settings. Additionally, we evaluate three baseline detection models and show that models trained on EchoFake achieve lower average EERs across datasets, indicating better generalization. By introducing more practical challenges relevant to real-world deployment, EchoFake offers a more realistic foundation for advancing spoofing detection methods.

Title: Relative Transfer Matrix Estimator using Covariance Subtraction
Authors: Wageesha N. Manamperi, Thushara D. Abhayapala
Abstract: The Relative Transfer Matrix (ReTM), recently introduced as a generalization of the relative transfer function for multiple receivers and sources, shows promising performance when applied to speech enhancement and speaker separation in noisy environments. Blindly estimating the ReTM of sound sources by exploiting the covariance matrices of multichannel recordings is highly beneficial for practical applications. In this paper, we use covariance subtraction to present a flexible and practically viable method for estimating the ReTM for a select set of independent sound sources. To show the versatility of the method, we validated it through a speaker separation application under reverberant conditions. Separation performance is evaluated at low signal-to-noise ratio levels in comparison with existing ReTM-based and relative transfer function-based estimators, in both simulated and real-life environments.

Title: Automated Morphological Analysis of Neurons in Fluorescence Microscopy Using YOLOv8
Authors: Banan Alnemri, Arwa Basbrain
Abstract: Accurate segmentation and precise morphological analysis of neuronal cells in fluorescence microscopy images are crucial steps in neuroscience and biomedical imaging applications. However, this process is labor-intensive and time-consuming, requiring significant manual effort and expertise to ensure reliable outcomes. This work presents a pipeline for neuron instance segmentation and measurement based on a high-resolution dataset of stem-cell-derived neurons. The proposed method uses YOLOv8, trained on manually annotated microscopy images. The model achieved high segmentation accuracy, exceeding 97%. In addition, the pipeline utilized both ground truth and predicted masks to extract biologically significant features, including cell length, width, area, and grayscale intensity values. The overall accuracy of the extracted morphological measurements reached 75.32%, further supporting the effectiveness of the proposed approach. This integrated framework offers a valuable tool for automated analysis in cell imaging and neuroscience research, reducing the need for manual annotation and enabling scalable, precise quantification of neuron morphology.

Abstract: This paper investigates security vulnerabilities and countermeasures for 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Fifth Generation New Radio (5G-NR) Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA)-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) localization in low-altitude urban environments. We first optimize node selection strategies under Air to Ground (A2G) channel conditions, proving that optimal selection depends on UAV altitude and deployment density. We propose lightweight User Equipment (UE)-assisted that reduce overhead while enhancing accuracy. We then expose critical security vulnerabilities by introducing merged-peak spoofing attacks where rogue UAVs transmit multiple lower-power pulses that merge with legitimate signals, bypassing existing detection methods. Through theoretical modeling and sensitivity analysis, we quantify how synchronization quality and geometric factors determine spoofing success probability, revealing fundamental weaknesses in current 3GPP positioning frameworks. To address these vulnerabilities, we design a network-centric anomaly detection framework at the Localization Management Function (LMF) using existing 3GPP-specified parameters, coupled with a recursive gradient descent-based robust localization algorithm that filters anomaly data while estimating UAV position. Our unified framework simultaneously provides robust victim localization and spoofer localization-capabilities not integrated in existing literature. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of both optimization and security mechanisms for 3GPP-compliant UAV positioning.

Title: On the Robustness of AFDM and OTFS Against Passive Eavesdroppers
Authors: Vincent Savaux, Hyeon Seok Rou, Zeping Sui, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, Zilong Liu
Abstract: We investigate the robustness of affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) and orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) waveforms against passive eavesdroppers performing brute-force demodulation to intercepted signals, under the assumption that eavesdroppers have no knowledge of chirp parameters (in AFDM) or the delay-Doppler grid configuration (in OTFS), such that they must search exhaustively over possible demodulation matrices. Analytical results show that the brute-force complexity scales as $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ for OTFS and $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ for AFDM, where $N$ is the number of subcarriers, indicating that AFDM has superior resilience over OTFS. Bit error rate (BER) simulations confirm the analysis by showing that, with AFDM, the signal remains nearly undecodable at the eavesdropper, while OTFS allows partial signal recovery under equivalent conditions.

Title: Multi-UAV Flood Monitoring via CVT with Gaussian Mixture of Density Functions for Coverage Control
Authors: Jie Song, Yang Bai, Mikhail Svinin, Naoki Wakamiya
Abstract: This study presents a control strategy for coordinating multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to monitor unknown flood regions and estimate the extent of inundation. The proposed method adopts a density-driven coverage framework based on Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT), in which the density function is modeled using a Gaussian Mixture of Density Functions (GMDF). This formulation provides a more accurate characterization of inundated areas compared to conventional axis-aligned Gaussian models. The performance of the two density modeling approaches is systematically evaluated under different UAV fleet sizes (16, 20, and 24), with multiple simulation trials conducted in the ROS/Gazebo environment. The results show that the GMDF-based formulation consistently achieves higher coverage rates, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing flood monitoring and improving UAV spatial distribution.

Title: VBx for End-to-End Neural and Clustering-based Diarization
Authors: Petr Pálka, Jiangyu Han, Marc Delcroix, Naohiro Tawara, Lukáš Burget
Abstract: We present improvements to speaker diarization in the two-stage end-to-end neural diarization with vector clustering (EEND-VC) framework. The first stage employs a Conformer-based EEND model with WavLM features to infer frame-level speaker activity within short windows. The identities and counts of global speakers are then derived in the second stage by clustering speaker embeddings across windows. The focus of this work is to improve the second stage; we filter unreliable embeddings from short segments and reassign them after clustering. We also integrate the VBx clustering to improve robustness when the number of speakers is large and individual speaking durations are limited. Evaluation on a compound benchmark spanning multiple domains is conducted without fine-tuning the EEND model or tuning clustering parameters per dataset. Despite this, the system generalizes well and matches or exceeds recent state-of-the-art performance.

Title: Control Barrier Functions for the Full Class of Signal Temporal Logic Tasks using Spatiotemporal Tubes
Authors: Ratnangshu Das, Subhodeep Choudhury, Pushpak Jagtap
Abstract: This paper introduces a new framework for synthesizing time-varying control barrier functions (TV-CBFs) for general Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications using spatiotemporal tubes (STT). We first formulate the STT synthesis as a robust optimization problem (ROP) and solve it through a scenario optimization problem (SOP), providing formal guarantees that the resulting tubes capture the given STL specifications. These STTs are then used to construct TV-CBFs, ensuring that under any control law rendering them invariant, the system satisfies the STL tasks. We demonstrate the framework through case studies on a differential-drive mobile robot and a quadrotor, and provide a comparative analysis showing improved efficiency over existing approaches.

Title: Optimal Kron-based Reduction of Networks (Opti-KRON) for Three-phase Distribution Feeders
Authors: Omid Mokhtari, Samuel Chevalier, Mads Almassalkhi
Abstract: This paper presents a novel structure-preserving, Kron-based reduction framework for unbalanced distribution feeders. The method aggregates electrically similar nodes within a mixed-integer optimization (MIP) problem to produce reduced networks that optimally reproduce the voltage profiles of the original full network. To overcome computational bottlenecks of MIP formulations, we propose an exhaustive-search formulation to identify optimal aggregation decisions while enforcing voltage margin limits. The proposed exhaustive network reduction algorithm is parallelizable on GPUs, which enables scalable network reduction. The resulting reduced networks approximate the full system's voltage profiles with low errors and are suitable for steady-state analysis and optimal power flow studies. The framework is validated on two real utility distribution feeders with 5,991 and 8,381 nodes. The reduced models achieve up to 90% and 80% network reduction, respectively, while the maximum voltage-magnitude error remains below 0.003 p.u. Furthermore, on a 1000-node version of the network, the GPU-accelerated reduction algorithm runs up to 15x faster than its CPU-based counterpart.

Title: Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network Model: A Novel Approach for LFP Contrast Sensitivity Tuning
Authors: Sahar Maleki, Reza Lashgari, Mahdi Aliyari Shoorehdeli, Mohammad Komareji
Abstract: Local field potentials (LFPs) have been demonstrated to be an important measurement to study the activity of a local population of neurons. The response tunings of LFPs have been mostly reported as weaker and broader than spike tunings. Therefore, selecting optimized tuning methods is essential for appropriately evaluating the LFP responses and comparing them with neighboring spiking activity. In this paper, new models for tuning of the contrast response functions (CRFs) are proposed. To this end, luminance contrast-evoked LFP responses recorded in primate primary visual cortex (V1) are first analyzed. Then, supersaturating CRFs are distinguished from linear and saturating CRFs by using monotonicity index (MI). The supersaturated recording data are then identified through static identification methods including multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network, radial basis function (RBF) neural network, fuzzy model, neuro-fuzzy model, and the local linear model tree (LOLIMOT) algorithm. Our results demonstrate that the MLP neural network, compared to traditional and modified hyperbolic Naka-Rushton functions, exhibits superior performance in tuning the local field potential responses to luminance contrast stimuli, resulting in successful tuning of a significantly higher number of neural recordings of all three types. These results suggest that the MLP neural network model can be used as a novel approach to measure a better fitted contrast sensitivity tuning curve of a population of neurons than other currently used models.

Title: Micro-Doppler Energy-Based Robust Multi-Target Vital Signs Monitoring Using 77-GHz FMCW Radar with Spatiotemporal Adaptive Processing
Authors: Chenxing Tan, Yuguan Hou, Hao Wang, Zhonghao Yuan
Abstract: This paper presents a novel micro-Doppler energy-based framework for robust multi-target vital signs monitoring using 77-GHz Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar. Unlike conventional phase-based methods that are susceptible to environmental noise, random body movements, and stringent calibration requirements, our approach exploits the energy variations in radar returns induced by cardiopulmonary activities. The proposed system integrates a comprehensive processing pipeline including space-time adaptive processing (STAP) for target detection and tracking, MUSIC algorithm for high-resolution angle estimation, and an innovative adaptive spectral filtering technique for vital signs extraction. We establish a rigorous mathematical framework that formalizes the relationship between micro-Doppler energy variations and physiological activities, enabling robust separation of closely spaced targets. The key innovation lies in the micro-Doppler energy extraction methodology that provides inherent robustness to phase noise and motion artifacts. Experimental results using millimeter-wave radar datasets demonstrate that the system can accurately detect and separate vital signs of up to four targets within \SI{5}{\meter} range, achieving mean absolute errors of \SI{1.2}beats per minute and \SI{2.3} beats per minute for respiration and heart rates, respectively. The proposed approach demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional phase-based methods, particularly in challenging multi-target scenarios with environmental noise and subject movement.

The paper reviews state-of-the-art architectures for terrestrial and non-terrestrial network integration, highlights recent field trials. Furthermore, key enabling technologies such as channel modeling, AI-driven resource allocation, interference control, mobility management, and energy-efficient communications are examined. The paper also outlines open research challenges. By addressing existing gaps in the literature, this survey positions HAPS as a foundational component of globally integrated, resilient, and sustainable 6G networks.

Title: Interpretable machine learning for cardiogram-based biometrics
Authors: Ilija Tanasković, Ljiljana B. Lazarević, Goran Knežević, Nikola Milosavljević, Olga Dubljević, Bojana Bjegojević, Nadica Miljković
Abstract: This study investigates the role of electrocardiogram (ECG) and impedance cardiogram (ICG) features in biometric identification, emphasizing their discriminative capacity and robustness to emotional variability. A total of 29 features spanning four domains (temporal, amplitude, slope, and morphological) are evaluated using random forest (RF) models combined with multiple interpretability methods. Feature importance shows that both ECG- and ICG-derived features are consistently ranked among the top 10 by Gini importance, permutation importance, and SHAP values, with ECG features, particularly QRS-centric descriptors, occupying the highest positions. In parallel, ICG BCX features contribute complementary, however, with lower cross-method stability. Correlation analysis reveals substantial multicollinearity, where the RF distributes and diminishes importance across highly correlated pairs, confirming reduced independent contributions. Statistical analysis identifies 14 features with significant differences between baseline and anger, without a clear pattern by domain. Feature selection with recursive feature elimination and genetic algorithms converges on a subset (14 features) that attains accuracy within 1% of the full set (99%), improving efficiency in storage and computation. These complementary analyses indicate that the individuality required for reliable identification is primarily encoded in QRS-related ECG features across all four domains. Meanwhile, BCX-derived ICG features contribute mainly through amplitude, providing supportive but less stable discriminatory cues. The confirmed resilience of QRS-centric descriptors to emotional variation, where stable inter-individual differences in the QRS complex could be traced to variations in ventricular mass, conduction pathways, and thoracic geometry, may indicate their central role in future models of cardiogram-based identity.

Title: Extending Resource Constrained Project Scheduling to Mega-Projects with Model-Based Systems Engineering & Hetero-functional Graph Theory
Authors: Amirreza Hosseini, Amro M. Farid
Abstract: Within the project management context, project scheduling serves as an indispensable component, functioning as a fundamental tool for planning, monitoring, controlling, and managing projects more broadly. Although the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) lies at the core of project management activities, it remains largely disconnected from the broader literature on model-based systems engineering (MBSE), thereby limiting its integration into the design and management of complex systems. The original contribution of this paper is twofold. First, the paper seeks to reconcile the RCPSP with the broader literature and vocabulary of model-based systems engineering and hetero-functional graph theory (HFGT). A concrete translation pipeline from an activity-on-node network to a SysML activity diagram, and then to an operand net is constructed. Using this representation, it specializes the hetero-functional network minimum-cost flow (HFNMCF) formulation to the RCPSP context as a systematic means of HFGT for quantitative analysis and proves that the RCPSP is recoverable as a special case of a broader model. Secondly, on an illustrative instance with renewable and non-renewable operands, the specialized HFNMCF, while producing similar schedules, yields explicit explanations of the project states that enable richer monitoring and control. Overall, the framework preserves the strengths of the classical RCPSP while accommodating real-world constraints and enterprise-level decision processes encountered in large, complex megaprojects.

Title: Motion Planning and Control of an Overactuated 4-Wheel Drive with Constrained Independent Steering
Authors: Shiyu Liu, Ilija Hadzic, Akshay Gupta, Aliasghar Arab
Abstract: This paper addresses motion planning and con- trol of an overactuated 4-wheel drive train with independent steering (4WIS) where mechanical constraints prevent the wheels from executing full 360-degree rotations (swerve). The configuration space of such a robot is constrained and contains discontinuities that affect the smoothness of the robot motion. We introduce a mathematical formulation of the steering constraints and derive discontinuity planes that partition the velocity space into regions of smooth and efficient motion. We further design the motion planner for path tracking and ob- stacle avoidance that explicitly accounts for swerve constraints and the velocity transition smoothness. The motion controller uses local feedback to generate actuation from the desired velocity, while properly handling the discontinuity crossing by temporarily stopping the motion and repositioning the wheels. We implement the proposed motion planner as an extension to ROS Navigation package and evaluate the system in simulation and on a physical robot.

Title: The MUSE Benchmark: Probing Music Perception and Auditory Relational Reasoning in Audio LLMS
Authors: Brandon James Carone, Iran R. Roman, Pablo Ripollés
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities in audio understanding, but current evaluations may obscure fundamental weaknesses in relational reasoning. We introduce the Music Understanding and Structural Evaluation (MUSE) Benchmark, an open-source resource with 10 tasks designed to probe fundamental music perception skills. We evaluate four SOTA models (Gemini Pro and Flash, Qwen2.5-Omni, and Audio-Flamingo 3) against a large human baseline (N=200). Our results reveal a wide variance in SOTA capabilities and a persistent gap with human experts. While Gemini Pro succeeds on basic perception, Qwen and Audio Flamingo 3 perform at or near chance, exposing severe perceptual deficits. Furthermore, we find Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting provides inconsistent, often detrimental results. Our work provides a critical tool for evaluating invariant musical representations and driving development of more robust AI systems.

Title: Convex Maneuver Planning for Spacecraft Collision Avoidance
Authors: Fausto Vega, Jon Arrizabalaga, Ryan Watson, Zachary Manchester
Abstract: Conjunction analysis and maneuver planning for spacecraft collision avoidance remains a manual and time-consuming process, typically involving repeated forward simulations of hand-designed maneuvers. With the growing density of satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO), autonomy is becoming essential for efficiently evaluating and mitigating collisions. In this work, we present an algorithm to design low-thrust collision-avoidance maneuvers for short-term conjunction events. We first formulate the problem as a nonconvex quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP), which we then relax into a convex semidefinite program (SDP) using Shor's relaxation. We demonstrate empirically that the relaxation is tight, which enables the recovery of globally optimal solutions to the original nonconvex problem. Our formulation produces a minimum-energy solution while ensuring a desired probability of collision at the time of closest approach. Finally, if the desired probability of collision cannot be satisfied, we relax this constraint into a penalty, yielding a minimum-risk solution. We validate our algorithm with a high-fidelity simulation of a satellite conjunction in low-Earth orbit with a simulated conjunction data message (CDM), demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing collision risk.

Title: A Learning-based Model Reference Adaptive Controller Implemented on a Prosthetic Hand Wrist
Authors: Shifa Sulaiman, Mohammad Gohari, Francesco Schetter, Fanny Ficuciello
Abstract: The functionality and natural motion of prosthetic hands remain limited by the challenges in controlling compliant wrist mechanisms. Current control strategies often lack adaptability and incur high computational costs, which impedes real-time deployment in assistive robotics. To address this gap, this study presents a computationally efficient Neural Network (NN)-based Model Reference Adaptive Controller (MRAC) for a tendon-driven soft continuum wrist integrated with a prosthetic hand. The dynamic modeling of the wrist is formulated using Timoshenko beam theory, capturing both shear and bending deformations. The proposed NN-MRAC estimates the required tendon forces from deflection errors and minimizes deviation from a reference model through online adaptation. Simulation results demonstrate improved precision with a root mean square error (RMSE) of $6.14 \times 10^{-4}$ m and a settling time of $3.2$s. Experimental validations confirm real-time applicability, with an average RMSE of $5.66 \times 10^{-3}$ m, steady-state error of $8.05 \times 10^{-3}$ m, and settling time of $1.58$ s. These results highlight the potential of the controller to enhance motion accuracy and responsiveness in soft prosthetic systems, thereby advancing the integration of adaptive intelligent control in wearable assistive devices.

Title: A Graph Signal Processing Framework for Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models
Authors: Valentin Noël
Abstract: Large language models achieve impressive results but distinguishing factual reasoning from hallucinations remains challenging. We propose a spectral analysis framework that models transformer layers as dynamic graphs induced by attention, with token embeddings as signals on these graphs. Through graph signal processing, we define diagnostics including Dirichlet energy, spectral entropy, and high-frequency energy ratios, with theoretical connections to computational stability. Experiments across GPT architectures suggest universal spectral patterns: factual statements exhibit consistent "energy mountain" behavior with low-frequency convergence, while different hallucination types show distinct signatures. Logical contradictions destabilize spectra with large effect sizes ($g>1.0$), semantic errors remain stable but show connectivity drift, and substitution hallucinations display intermediate perturbations. A simple detector using spectral signatures achieves 88.75% accuracy versus 75% for perplexity-based baselines, demonstrating practical utility. These findings indicate that spectral geometry may capture reasoning patterns and error behaviors, potentially offering a framework for hallucination detection in large language models.

Title: Steering Autoregressive Music Generation with Recursive Feature Machines
Authors: Daniel Zhao, Daniel Beaglehole, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick, Julian McAuley, Zachary Novack
Abstract: Controllable music generation remains a significant challenge, with existing methods often requiring model retraining or introducing audible artifacts. We introduce MusicRFM, a framework that adapts Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs) to enable fine-grained, interpretable control over frozen, pre-trained music models by directly steering their internal activations. RFMs analyze a model's internal gradients to produce interpretable "concept directions", or specific axes in the activation space that correspond to musical attributes like notes or chords. We first train lightweight RFM probes to discover these directions within MusicGen's hidden states; then, during inference, we inject them back into the model to guide the generation process in real-time without per-step optimization. We present advanced mechanisms for this control, including dynamic, time-varying schedules and methods for the simultaneous enforcement of multiple musical properties. Our method successfully navigates the trade-off between control and generation quality: we can increase the accuracy of generating a target musical note from 0.23 to 0.82, while text prompt adherence remains within approximately 0.02 of the unsteered baseline, demonstrating effective control with minimal impact on prompt fidelity. We release code to encourage further exploration on RFMs in the music domain.

Title: Training-Free Spectral Fingerprints of Voice Processing in Transformers
Authors: Valentin Noël
Abstract: Different transformer architectures implement identical linguistic computations via distinct connectivity patterns, yielding model imprinted ``computational fingerprints'' detectable through spectral analysis. Using graph signal processing on attention induced token graphs, we track changes in algebraic connectivity (Fiedler value, $\Delta\lambda_2$) under voice alternation across 20 languages and three model families, with a prespecified early window (layers 2--5). Our analysis uncovers clear architectural signatures: Phi-3-Mini shows a dramatic English specific early layer disruption ($\overline{\Delta\lambda_2}_{[2,5]}\!\approx\!-0.446$) while effects in 19 other languages are minimal, consistent with public documentation that positions the model primarily for English use. Qwen2.5-7B displays small, distributed shifts that are largest for morphologically rich languages, and LLaMA-3.2-1B exhibits systematic but muted responses. These spectral signatures correlate strongly with behavioral differences (Phi-3: $r=-0.976$) and are modulated by targeted attention head ablations, linking the effect to early attention structure and confirming functional relevance. Taken together, the findings are consistent with the view that training emphasis can leave detectable computational imprints: specialized processing strategies that manifest as measurable connectivity patterns during syntactic transformations. Beyond voice alternation, the framework differentiates reasoning modes, indicating utility as a simple, training free diagnostic for revealing architectural biases and supporting model reliability analysis.

Title: Policy Gradient Method for LQG Control via Input-Output-History Representation: Convergence to $O(ε)$-Stationary Points
Authors: Tomonori Sadamoto, Takashi Tanaka
Abstract: We study the policy gradient method (PGM) for the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) dynamic output-feedback control problem using an input-output-history (IOH) representation of the closed-loop system. First, we show that any dynamic output-feedback controller is equivalent to a static partial-state feedback gain for a new system representation characterized by a finite-length IOH. Leveraging this equivalence, we reformulate the search for an optimal dynamic output feedback controller as an optimization problem over the corresponding partial-state feedback gain. Next, we introduce a relaxed version of the IOH-based LQG problem by incorporating a small process noise with covariance $\epsilon I$ into the new system to ensure coerciveness, a key condition for establishing gradient-based convergence guarantees. Consequently, we show that a vanilla PGM for the relaxed problem converges to an $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$-stationary point, i.e., $\overline{K}$ satisfying $\|\nabla J(\overline{K})\|_F \leq \mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$, where $J$ denotes the original LQG cost. Numerical experiments empirically indicate convergence to the vicinity of the globally optimal LQG controller.

Title: Query-Efficient Zeroth-Order Algorithms for Nonconvex Optimization
Authors: Ruiyang Jin, Yuke Zhou, Yujie Tang, Jie Song, Siyang Gao
Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization (ZO) has been a powerful framework for solving black-box problems, which estimates gradients using zeroth-order data to update variables iteratively. The practical applicability of ZO critically depends on the efficiency of single-step gradient estimation and the overall query complexity. However, existing ZO algorithms cannot achieve efficiency on both simultaneously. In this work, we consider a general constrained optimization model with black-box objective and constraint functions. To solve it, we propose novel algorithms that can achieve the state-of-the-art overall query complexity bound of $\mathcal{O}(d/\epsilon^4)$ to find an $\epsilon$-stationary solution ($d$ is the dimension of variable space), while reducing the queries for estimating a single-step gradient from $\mathcal{O}(d)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$. Specifically, we integrate block updates with gradient descent ascent and a block gradient estimator, which leads to two algorithms, ZOB-GDA and ZOB-SGDA, respectively. Instead of constructing full gradients, they estimate only partial gradients along random blocks of dimensions, where the adjustable block sizes enable high single-step efficiency without sacrificing convergence guarantees. Our theoretical results establish the finite-sample convergence of the proposed algorithms for nonconvex optimization. Finally, numerical experiments on a practical problem demonstrate that our algorithms require over ten times fewer queries than existing methods.

Title: Res-DPU: Resource-shared Digital Processing-in-memory Unit for Edge-AI Workloads
Authors: Mukul Lokhande, Narendra Singh Dhakad, Seema Chouhan, Akash Sankhe, Santosh Kumar Vishvakarma
Abstract: Processing-in-memory (PIM) has emerged as the go to solution for addressing the von Neumann bottleneck in edge AI accelerators. However, state-of-the-art (SoTA) digital PIM approaches suffer from low compute density, primarily due to the use of bulky bit cells and transistor-heavy adder trees, which impose limitations on macro scalability and energy efficiency. This work introduces Res-DPU, a resource-shared digital PIM unit, with a dual-port 5T SRAM latch and shared 2T AND compute logic. This reflects the per-bit multiplication cost to just 5.25T and reduced the transistor count of the PIM array by up to 56% over the SoTA works. Furthermore, a Transistor-Reduced 2D Interspersed Adder Tree (TRAIT) with FA-7T and PG-FA-26T helps reduce the power consumption of the adder tree by up to 21.35% and leads to improved energy efficiency by 59% compared to conventional 28T RCA designs. We propose a Cycle-controlled Iterative Approximate-Accurate Multiplication (CIA2M) approach, enabling run-time accuracy-latency trade-offs without requiring error-correction circuitry. The 16 KB REP-DPIM macro achieves 0.43 TOPS throughput and 87.22 TOPS/W energy efficiency in TSMC 65nm CMOS, with 96.85% QoR for ResNet-18 or VGG-16 on CIFAR-10, including 30% pruning. The proposed results establish a Res-DPU module for highly scalable and energy-efficient real-time edge AI accelerators.

Title: Magnetic field estimation using Gaussian process regression for interactive wireless power system design
Authors: Yuichi Honjo, Cedric Caremel, Ken Takaki, Yuta Noma, Yoshihiro Kawahara, Takuya Sasatani
Abstract: Wireless power transfer (WPT) with coupled resonators offers a promising solution for the seamless powering of electronic devices. Interactive design approaches that visualize the magnetic field and power transfer efficiency based on system geometry adjustments can facilitate the understanding and exploration of the behavior of these systems for dynamic applications. However, typical electromagnetic field simulation methods, such as the Method of Moments (MoM), require significant computational resources, limiting the rate at which computation can be performed for acceptable interactivity. Furthermore, the system's sensitivity to positional and geometrical changes necessitates a large number of simulations, and structures such as ferromagnetic shields further complicate these simulations. Here, we introduce a machine learning approach using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), demonstrating for the first time the rapid estimation of the entire magnetic field and power transfer efficiency for near-field coupled systems. To achieve quick and accurate estimation, we develop 3D adaptive grid systems and an active learning strategy to effectively capture the nonlinear interactions between complex system geometries and magnetic fields. By training a regression model, our approach achieves magnetic field computation with sub-second latency and with an average error of less than 6% when validated against independent electromagnetic simulation results.

Title: Risk Assessment of an Autonomous Underwater Snake Robot in Confined Operations
Authors: Abdelrahman Sayed Sayed
Abstract: The growing interest in ocean discovery imposes a need for inspection and intervention in confined and demanding environments. Eely's slender shape, in addition to its ability to change its body configurations, makes articulated underwater robots an adequate option for such environments. However, operation of Eely in such environments imposes demanding requirements on the system, as it must deal with uncertain and unstructured environments, extreme environmental conditions, and reduced navigational capabilities. This paper proposes a Bayesian approach to assess the risks of losing Eely during two mission scenarios. The goal of this work is to improve Eely's performance and the likelihood of mission success. Sensitivity analysis results are presented in order to demonstrate the causes having the highest impact on losing Eely.

Title: Re-evaluating Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding for Automatic Speech Recognition
Authors: Yuu Jinnai
Abstract: Recent work has shown that sample-based Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding outperforms beam search in text-to-text generation tasks, such as machine translation, text summarization, and image captioning. On the other hand, beam search is the current practice for speech-to-text tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and Speech Translation (ST). Given that MBR decoding is effective in text-to-text generation tasks, it is reasonable to expect it to also be effective for speech-to-text tasks. In this paper, we evaluate MBR decoding for ASR and ST tasks on English and Japanese using Whisper and its derivative models. We observe that the accuracy of MBR decoding outperforms that of beam search in most of the experimental settings we have evaluated. The results show that MBR decoding is a promising method for offline ASR and ST tasks that require high accuracy. The code is available at this https URL

Title: Which Evaluation for Which Model? A Taxonomy for Speech Model Assessment
Authors: Maureen de Seyssel, Eeshan Gunesh Dhekane
Abstract: Speech foundation models have recently achieved remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, their evaluation remains disjointed across tasks and model types. Different models excel at distinct aspects of speech processing and thus require different evaluation protocols. This paper proposes a unified taxonomy that addresses the question: Which evaluation is appropriate for which model? The taxonomy defines three orthogonal axes: the \textbf{evaluation aspect} being measured, the model capabilities required to attempt the task, and the task or protocol requirements needed to perform it. We classify a broad set of existing evaluations and benchmarks along these axes, spanning areas such as representation learning, speech generation, and interactive dialogue. By mapping each evaluation to the capabilities a model exposes (e.g., speech generation, real-time processing) and to its methodological demands (e.g., fine-tuning data, human judgment), the taxonomy provides a principled framework for aligning models with suitable evaluation methods. It also reveals systematic gaps, such as limited coverage of prosody, interaction, or reasoning, that highlight priorities for future benchmark design. Overall, this work offers a conceptual foundation and practical guide for selecting, interpreting, and extending evaluations of speech models.

Title: Nodal Capacity Expansion Planning with Flexible Large-Scale Load Siting
Authors: Tomas Valencia Zuluaga, Simon Pang, Jean-Paul Watson
Abstract: We propose explicitly incorporating large-scale load siting into a stochastic nodal power system capacity expansion planning model that concurrently co-optimizes generation, transmission and storage expansion. The potential operational flexibility of some of these large loads is also taken into account by considering them as consisting of a set of tranches with different reliability requirements, which are modeled as a constraint on expected served energy across operational scenarios. We implement our model as a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer optimization problem with cross-scenario expectation constraints. To overcome the challenge of scalability, we build upon existing work to implement this model on a high performance computing platform and exploit scenario parallelization using an augmented Progressive Hedging Algorithm. The algorithm is implemented using the bounding features of mpisppy, which have shown to provide satisfactory provable optimality gaps despite the absence of theoretical guarantees of convergence. We test our approach to assess the value of this proactive planning framework on total system cost and reliability metrics using realistic testcases geographically assigned to San Diego and South Carolina, with datacenter and direct air capture facilities as large loads.

Title: Iterated Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IterIEKF)
Authors: Sven Goffin, Axel Barrau, Silvère Bonnabel, Olivier Brüls, Pierre Sacré
Abstract: We study the mathematical properties of the Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) when iterating on the measurement update step, following the principles of the well-known Iterated Extended Kalman Filter. This iterative variant of the IEKF (IterIEKF) systematically improves its accuracy through Gauss-Newton-based relinearization, and exhibits additional theoretical properties, particularly in the low-noise regime, that resemble those of the linear Kalman filter. We apply the proposed approach to the problem of estimating the extended pose of a crane payload using an inertial measurement unit. Our results suggest that the IterIEKF significantly outperforms the IEKF when measurements are highly accurate.

Title: Discretized Gaussian Representation for Tomographic Reconstruction
Authors: Shaokai Wu, Yuxiang Lu, Yapan Guo, Wei Ji, Suizhi Huang, Fengyu Yang, Shalayiding Sirejiding, Qichen He, Jing Tong, Yanbiao Ji, Yue Ding, Hongtao Lu
Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) enables detailed cross-sectional imaging but continues to face challenges in balancing reconstruction quality and computational efficiency. While deep learning-based methods have significantly improved image quality and noise reduction, they typically require large-scale training data and intensive computation. Recent advances in scene reconstruction, such as Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting, offer alternative perspectives but are not well-suited for direct volumetric CT reconstruction. In this work, we propose Discretized Gaussian Representation (DGR), a novel framework that reconstructs the 3D volume directly using a set of discretized Gaussian functions in an end-to-end manner. To further enhance efficiency, we introduce Fast Volume Reconstruction, a highly parallelized technique that aggregates Gaussian contributions into the voxel grid with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that DGR achieves superior reconstruction quality and runtime performance across various CT reconstruction scenarios.

Title: Fast MRI for All: Bridging Access Gaps by Training without Raw Data
Authors: Yaşar Utku Alçalar, Merve Gülle, Mehmet Akçakaya
Abstract: Physics-driven deep learning (PD-DL) approaches have become popular for improved reconstruction of fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Though PD-DL offers higher acceleration rates than existing clinical fast MRI techniques, their use has been limited outside specialized MRI centers. A key challenge is generalization to rare pathologies or different populations, noted in multiple studies, with fine-tuning on target populations suggested for improvement. However, current approaches for PD-DL training require access to raw k-space measurements, which is typically only available at specialized MRI centers that have research agreements for such data access. This is especially an issue for rural and under-resourced areas, where commercial MRI scanners only provide access to a final reconstructed image. To tackle these challenges, we propose Compressibility-inspired Unsupervised Learning via Parallel Imaging Fidelity (CUPID) for high-quality PD-DL training using only routine clinical reconstructed images exported from an MRI scanner. CUPID evaluates output quality with a compressibility-based approach while ensuring that the output stays consistent with the clinical parallel imaging reconstruction through well-designed perturbations. Our results show CUPID achieves similar quality to established PD-DL training that requires k-space data while outperforming compressed sensing (CS) and diffusion-based generative methods. We further demonstrate its effectiveness in a zero-shot training setup for retrospectively and prospectively sub-sampled acquisitions, attesting to its minimal training burden. As an approach that radically deviates from existing strategies, CUPID presents an opportunity to provide broader access to fast MRI for remote and rural populations in an attempt to reduce the obstacles associated with this expensive imaging modality.

Title: CISSIR: Beam Codebooks with Self-Interference Reduction Guarantees for Integrated Sensing and Communication Beyond 5G
Authors: Rodrigo Hernangómez, Jochen Fink, Renato L. G. Cavalcante, Sławomir Stańczak
Abstract: We propose a beam codebook design for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) that reduces self-interference (SI) to alleviate analog distortion. Our optimization framework, which considers either tapered beamforming or phased arrays for both analog and hybrid schemes, modifies given reference codebooks such that a certain SI power level is achieved. In contrast to other low-SI codebooks, which often rely on hardly interpretable optimization parameters, we provide design guidelines to obtain sensing performance guarantees by deriving analytical bounds on saturation and analog-to-digital quantization in relation to the multipath SI level. By selecting standard reference codebooks in our simulations, we show how our method substantially improves the signal-to-noise ratio for sensing with little impact on 5G-NR communication.

Title: Model-Based Learning for DOA Estimation with One-Bit Single-Snapshot Sparse Arrays
Authors: Yunqiao Hu, Shunqiao Sun, Yimin D. Zhang
Abstract: We address the challenging problem of estimating the directions-of-arrival (DOAs) of multiple off-grid signals using a single snapshot of one-bit quantized measurements. Conventional DOA estimation methods face difficulties in tackling this problem effectively. This paper introduces a domain-knowledge-guided learning framework to achieve high-resolution DOA estimation in such a scenario, thus drastically reducing hardware complexity without compromising performance. We first reformulate DOA estimation as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) problem, unifying on-grid and off-grid scenarios under a Laplacian-type sparsity prior to effectively enforce sparsity for both uniform and sparse linear arrays. For off-grid signals, a first-order approximation grid model is embedded into the one-bit signal model. We then reinterpret one-bit sensing as a binary classification task, employing a multivariate Bernoulli likelihood with a logistic link function to enhance stability and estimation accuracy. To resolve the non-convexity inherent in the MAP formulation, we develop augmented algorithmic frameworks based on majorization-minimization principles. Further, we design model-based inference neural networks by deep unrolling these frameworks, significantly reducing computational complexity while preserving the estimation precision. Extensive simulations demonstrate the robustness of the proposed framework across a wide range of input signal-to-noise ratio values and off-grid deviations. By integrating the unified model-based priors with data-driven learning, this work bridges the gap between theoretical guarantees and practical feasibility in one-bit single-snapshot DOA estimation, offering a scalable, hardware-efficient solution for next-generation radar and communication systems.

Title: AttentionSwarm: Reinforcement Learning with Attention Control Barier Function for Crazyflie Drones in Dynamic Environments
Authors: Grik Tadevosyan, Valerii Serpiva, Aleksey Fedoseev, Roohan Ahmed Khan, Demetros Aschu, Faryal Batool, Nickolay Efanov, Artem Mikhaylov, Dzmitry Tsetserukou
Abstract: We introduce AttentionSwarm, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate safe and efficient swarm control in a dynamic drone racing scenario. Central to our approach is the Attention Model-Based Control Barrier Function (CBF) framework, which integrates attention mechanisms with safety-critical control theory to enable real-time collision avoidance and trajectory optimization. This framework dynamically prioritizes critical obstacles and agents in the swarm's vicinity using attention weights, while CBFs formally guarantee safety by enforcing collision-free constraints. The AttentionSwarm algorithm was developed and evaluated using a swarm of Crazyflie 2.1 micro quadrotors, which were tested indoors with the Vicon motion capture system to ensure precise localization and control. Experimental results show that our system achieves a 95-100% collision-free navigation rate in a dynamic multi-agent drone racing environment, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios. This work offers a promising foundation for safe, high-speed multi-robot applications in logistics, inspection, and racing.

Title: Performance and Complexity Analysis of Terahertz-Band MIMO Detection
Authors: Hakim Jemaa, Simon Tarboush, Hadi Sarieddeen, Mohamed-Slim Alouini, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri
Abstract: Achieving terabit-per-second (Tbps) data rates in terahertz (THz)-band communications requires bridging the complexity gap in baseband transceiver design. This work addresses the signal processing challenges associated with data detection in THz-band multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We begin by analyzing the trade-offs between performance and complexity across various detection schemes and THz channel models, demonstrating significant complexity reduction by leveraging spatial parallelism across subspaces of correlated, typically ill-conditioned THz MIMO channels. We also derive accurate theoretical bounds on the detection error probability by incorporating THz-specific channel distributions and accounting for mismatches introduced by subspace decomposition. In addition, we propose a variation of subspace detectors that combines channel-matrix sorting, QR decomposition, and puncturing. Furthermore, under wideband THz UM-MIMO systems, we introduce a channel-matrix reuse strategy that minimizes exhaustive computations while maintaining reliable detection performance within a coherence bandwidth. Simulations over accurate THz channels show that the proposed efficient spatial parallelization schemes yield multi-dB performance gains, while the proposed reuse strategy offers significant computational savings with minimal performance degradation.

Title: A Data-Driven Method to Identify Major Contributors to Low-Frequency Oscillations
Authors: Youhong Chen, Debraj Bhattacharjee, Balarko Chaudhuri
Abstract: We present a purely data-driven method to pinpoint generation plants that significantly contribute to poorly damped oscillations as part of post-event analysis. First, Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) is applied on PMU data from the point of interconnection (POI) of the plants to obtain the finite-dimensional Koopman operator. Then, modal analysis is performed on a reduced-order Koopman operator to extract spatio-temporal patterns. The data-driven eigenvalues and eigenvectors quantify each plant's contribution to critical oscillatory modes without requiring any system model information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method through simulated case studies on modified IEEE 39-bus and WECC 179-bus test systems by benchmarking the data-driven results against ground-truth models. Its performance is further validated using PMU data from real oscillation events in the ISO-New England system. This data-driven method offers a practical tool for both planning-stage simulations and post-event analysis of real oscillation events, enabling effective mitigation.

Title: Advancing Image Super-resolution Techniques in Remote Sensing: A Comprehensive Survey
Authors: Yunliang Qi, Meng Lou, Yimin Liu, Lu Li, Zhen Yang, Wen Nie
Abstract: Remote sensing image super-resolution (RSISR) is a crucial task in remote sensing image processing, aiming to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images from their low-resolution (LR) counterparts. Despite the growing number of RSISR methods proposed in recent years, a systematic and comprehensive review of these methods is still lacking. This paper presents a thorough review of RSISR algorithms, covering methodologies, datasets, and evaluation metrics. We provide an in-depth analysis of RSISR methods, categorizing them into supervised, unsupervised, and quality evaluation approaches, to help researchers understand current trends and challenges. Our review also discusses the strengths, limitations, and inherent challenges of these techniques. Notably, our analysis reveals significant limitations in existing methods, particularly in preserving fine-grained textures and geometric structures under large-scale degradation. Based on these findings, we outline future research directions, highlighting the need for domain-specific architectures and robust evaluation protocols to bridge the gap between synthetic and real-world RSISR scenarios.

Title: SongBloom: Coherent Song Generation via Interleaved Autoregressive Sketching and Diffusion Refinement
Authors: Chenyu Yang, Shuai Wang, Hangting Chen, Wei Tan, Jianwei Yu, Haizhou Li
Abstract: Generating music with coherent structure, harmonious instrumental and vocal elements remains a significant challenge in song generation. Existing language models and diffusion-based methods often struggle to balance global coherence with local fidelity, resulting in outputs that lack musicality or suffer from incoherent progression and mismatched lyrics. This paper introduces $\textbf{SongBloom}$, a novel framework for full-length song generation that leverages an interleaved paradigm of autoregressive sketching and diffusion-based refinement. SongBloom employs an autoregressive diffusion model that combines the high fidelity of diffusion models with the scalability of language models. Specifically, it gradually extends a musical sketch from short to long and refines the details from coarse to fine-grained. The interleaved generation paradigm effectively integrates prior semantic and acoustic context to guide the generation process. Experimental results demonstrate that SongBloom outperforms existing methods across both subjective and objective metrics and achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art commercial music generation platforms. Audio samples are available on our demo page: this https URL. The code and model weights have been released on this https URL .

Authors: Rahul Gulia, Amlan Ganguly, Andres Kwasinski, Michael E. Kuhl, Ehsan Rashedi, Clark Hochgraf
Abstract: The next decade will usher in a profound transformation of wireless communication, driven by the ever-increasing demand for data-intensive applications and the rapid adoption of emerging technologies. To fully unlock the potential of 5G and beyond, substantial advancements are required in signal processing techniques, innovative network architectures, and efficient spectrum utilization strategies. These advancements facilitate seamless integration of emerging technologies, driving industrial digital transformation and connectivity. This paper introduces a novel Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based framework, Wireless Infrastructure for Smart Warehouses using VAE (WISVA), designed for accurate indoor radio propagation modeling in automated Industry 4.0 environments such as warehouses and factory floors operating within 5G wireless bands. The research delves into the meticulous creation of training data tensors, capturing complex electromagnetic (EM) wave behaviors influenced by diverse obstacles, and outlines the architecture and training methodology of the proposed VAE model. The model's robustness and adaptability are showcased through its ability to predict signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) heatmaps across various scenarios, including denoising tasks, validation datasets, extrapolation to unseen configurations, and previously unencountered warehouse layouts. Compelling reconstruction error heatmaps are presented, highlighting the superior accuracy of WISVA compared to traditional autoencoder models.

Title: Closed-form Expression for the Power Profile in Wideband Systems with Inter-channel Stimulated Raman Scattering
Authors: Lucas Alves Zischler, Chiara Lasagni, Paolo Serena, Alberto Bononi, Giammarco Di Sciullo, Divya A. Shaji, Antonio Mecozzi, Cristian Antonelli
Abstract: Wideband systems experience significant inter-channel stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS) and channel-dependent losses. Due to the non-uniform attenuation profile, the combined effects of ISRS and fiber loss can only be accurately estimated using numerical methods. In this work, we present an approximate closed-form expression for the channels' power profile accounting for these combined effects. We validate the proposed expression against numerical solutions in the case of CLU transmission, showing high accuracy for both single-span and multi-span fiber-optic links. Additionally, we derive an inverse expression, formulated as a function of the output power, which can be utilized to target a desired optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) profile through pre-emphasis of the launched channel powers.

Title: Modeling and Simulation of an Active Car Suspension with a Robust LQR Controller under Road Disturbance, Parameter Uncertainty and White Noise
Authors: Mehmet Karahan
Abstract: Vehicle suspension is important for passengers to travel comfortably and to be less exposed to effects such as vibration and shock. A good suspension system increases the road holding of vehicles, allows them to take turns safely, and reduces the risk of traffic accidents. A passive suspension system is the most widely used suspension system in vehicles due to its simple structure and low cost. Passive suspension systems do not have an actuator and therefore do not have a controller. Active suspension systems have an actuator and a controller. Although their structures are more complex and costly, they are safer. PID controller is widely used in active suspension systems due to its simple structure, reasonable cost, and easy adjustment of coefficients. In this study, a more robust LQR-controlled active suspension was designed than a passive suspension and a PID-controlled active suspension. Robustness analyses were performed for passive suspension, PID-controlled active suspension, and LQR-controlled active suspension. Suspension travel, sprung mass acceleration, and sprung mass motion simulations were performed for all three suspensions under road disturbance, under simultaneous road disturbance and parameter uncertainty and under road disturbance with white noise. A comparative analysis was performed by obtaining the rise time, overshoot, and settling time data of the suspensions under different conditions. It was observed that the LQR-controlled active suspension showed the fastest rise time, the least overshoot and had the shortest settling time. In this case, it was proven that the LQR controlled active suspension provided a more comfortable and safe ride compared to the other two suspension systems.

Title: A Compute&Memory Efficient Model-Driven Neural 5G Receiver for Edge AI-assisted RAN
Authors: Mahdi Abdollahpour, Marco Bertuletti, Yichao Zhang, Yawei Li, Luca Benini, Alessandro Vanelli-Coralli
Abstract: Artificial intelligence approaches for base-band processing for radio receivers have demonstrated significant performance gains. Most of the proposed methods are characterized by high compute and memory requirements, hindering their deployment at the edge of the Radio Access Networks (RAN) and limiting their scalability to large bandwidths and many antenna 6G systems. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity, model-driven neural network-based receiver, designed for multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems and suitable for implementation at the RAN edge. The proposed solution is compliant with the 5G New Radio (5G NR), and supports different modulation schemes, bandwidths, number of users, and number of base-station antennas with a single trained model without the need for further training. Numerical simulations of the Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) processing show that the proposed solution outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of achievable Transport Block Error Rate (TBLER), while reducing the Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) by 66$\times$, and the learnable parameters by 396$\times$.

Title: Team Westwood Solution for MIDOG 2025 Challenge: An Ensemble-CNN-Based Approach For Mitosis Detection And Classification
Authors: Tengyou Xu, Haochen Yang, Xiang 'Anthony' Chen, Hongyan Gu, Mohammad Haeri
Abstract: This abstract presents our solution (Team Westwood) for mitosis detection and atypical mitosis classification in the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG) 2025 challenge. For mitosis detection, we trained an nnUNetV2 for initial mitosis candidate screening with high sensitivity, followed by a random forest classifier ensembling predictions of three convolutional neural networks (CNNs): EfficientNet-b3, EfficientNet-b5, and EfficientNetV2-s. For the atypical mitosis classification, we trained another random forest classifier ensembling the predictions of three CNNs: EfficientNet-b3, EfficientNet-b5, and InceptionV3. On the preliminary test set, our solution achieved an F1 score of 0.7450 for track 1 mitosis detection, and a balanced accuracy of 0.8722 for track 2 atypical mitosis classification. On the final test set, our solution achieved an F1 score of 0.6972 for track 1 mitosis detection, and a balanced accuracy of 0.8242 for track 2 atypical mitosis classification.

Title: Are Modern Speech Enhancement Systems Vulnerable to Adversarial Attacks?
Authors: Rostislav Makarov, Lea Schönherr, Timo Gerkmann
Abstract: Machine learning approaches for speech enhancement are becoming increasingly expressive, enabling ever more powerful modifications of input signals. In this paper, we demonstrate that this expressiveness introduces a vulnerability: advanced speech enhancement models can be susceptible to adversarial attacks. Specifically, we show that adversarial noise, carefully crafted and psychoacoustically masked by the original input, can be injected such that the enhanced speech output conveys an entirely different semantic meaning. We experimentally verify that contemporary predictive speech enhancement models can indeed be manipulated in this way. Furthermore, we highlight that diffusion models with stochastic samplers exhibit inherent robustness to such adversarial attacks by design.

Title: Untangling Vascular Trees for Surgery and Interventional Radiology
Authors: Guillaume Houry, Tom Boeken, Stéphanie Allassonnière, Jean Feydy
Abstract: The diffusion of minimally invasive, endovascular interventions motivates the development of visualization methods for complex vascular networks. We propose a planar representation of blood vessel trees which preserves the properties that are most relevant to catheter navigation: topology, length and curvature. Taking as input a three-dimensional digital angiography, our algorithm produces a faithful two-dimensional map of the patient's vessels within a few seconds. To this end, we propose optimized implementations of standard morphological filters and a new recursive embedding algorithm that preserves the global orientation of the vascular network. We showcase our method on peroperative images of the brain, pelvic and knee artery networks. On the clinical side, our method simplifies the choice of devices prior to and during the intervention. This lowers the risk of failure during navigation or device deployment and may help to reduce the gap between expert and common intervention centers. From a research perspective, our method simulates the cadaveric display of artery trees from anatomical dissections. This opens the door to large population studies on the branching patterns and tortuosity of fine human blood vessels. Our code is released under the permissive MIT license as part of the scikit-shapes Python library (this https URL ).

Title: Variable Rate Image Compression via N-Gram Context based Swin-transformer
Authors: Priyanka Mudgal
Abstract: This paper presents an N-gram context-based Swin Transformer for learned image compression. Our method achieves variable-rate compression with a single model. By incorporating N-gram context into the Swin Transformer, we overcome its limitation of neglecting larger regions during high-resolution image reconstruction due to its restricted receptive field. This enhancement expands the regions considered for pixel restoration, thereby improving the quality of high-resolution reconstructions. Our method increases context awareness across neighboring windows, leading to a -5.86\% improvement in BD-Rate over existing variable-rate learned image compression techniques. Additionally, our model improves the quality of regions of interest (ROI) in images, making it particularly beneficial for object-focused applications in fields such as manufacturing and industrial vision systems.

Title: Time-causal and time-recursive wavelets
Authors: Tony Lindeberg
Abstract: When to apply wavelet analysis to real-time temporal signals, where the future cannot be accessed, it is essential to base all the steps in the signal processing pipeline on computational mechanisms that are truly time-causal. This paper describes how a time-causal wavelet analysis can be performed based on concepts developed in the area of temporal scale-space theory, originating from a complete classification of temporal smoothing kernels that guarantee non-creation of new structures from finer to coarser temporal scale levels. By necessity, convolution with truncated exponential kernels in cascade constitutes the only permissable class of kernels, as well as their temporal derivatives as a natural complement to fulfil the admissibility conditions of wavelet representations. For a particular way of choosing the time constants in the resulting infinite convolution of truncated exponential kernels, to ensure temporal scale covariance and thus self-similarity over temporal scales, we describe how mother wavelets can be chosen as temporal derivatives of the resulting time-causal limit kernel. By developing connections between wavelet theory and scale-space theory, we characterize and quantify how the continuous scaling properties transfer to the discrete implementation, demonstrating how the proposed time-causal wavelet representation can reflect the duration of locally dominant temporal structures in the input signals. We propose that this notion of time-causal wavelet analysis could be a valuable tool for signal processing tasks, where streams of signals are to be processed in real time, specifically for signals that may contain local variations over a rich span of temporal scales, or more generally for analysing physical or biophysical temporal phenomena, where a fully time-causal analysis is called for to be physically realistic.

Title: Memory-Augmented Generative AI for Real-time Wireless Prediction in Dynamic Industrial Environments
Authors: Rahul Gulia, Amlan Ganguly, Michael E. Kuhl, Ehsan Rashedi, Clark Hochgraf
Abstract: Accurate and real-time prediction of wireless channel conditions, particularly the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), is a foundational requirement for enabling Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) in highly dynamic Industry 4.0 environments. Traditional physics-based or statistical models fail to cope with the spatio-temporal complexities introduced by mobile obstacles and transient interference inherent to smart warehouses. To address this, we introduce Evo-WISVA (Evolutionary Wireless Infrastructure for Smart Warehouse using VAE), a novel synergistic deep learning architecture that functions as a lightweight 2D predictive digital twin of the radio environment. Evo-WISVA integrates a memory-augmented Variational Autoencoder (VAE) featuring an Attention-driven Latent Memory Module (LMM) for robust, context-aware spatial feature extraction, with a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network for precise temporal forecasting and sequential refinement. The entire pipeline is optimized end-to-end via a joint loss function, ensuring optimal feature alignment between the generative and predictive components. Rigorous experimental evaluation conducted on a high-fidelity ns-3-generated industrial warehouse dataset demonstrates that Evo-WISVA significantly surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 47.6\% reduction in average reconstruction error. Crucially, the model exhibits exceptional generalization capacity to unseen environments with vastly increased dynamic complexity (up to ten simultaneously moving obstacles) while maintaining amortized computational efficiency essential for real-time deployment. Evo-WISVA establishes a foundational technology for proactive wireless resource management, enabling autonomous optimization and advancing the realization of predictive digital twins in industrial communication networks.

Title: Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning for Large-Scale EV Smart Charging Considering Distribution Network Voltage Constraints
Authors: Stavros Orfanoudakis, Frans A. Oliehoek, Peter Palensky, Pedro P. Vergara
Abstract: Electric Vehicles (EVs) offer substantial flexibility for grid services, yet large-scale, uncoordinated charging can threaten voltage stability in distribution networks. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches for smart charging often disregard physical grid constraints or have limited performance for complex large-scale tasks, limiting their scalability and real-world applicability. This paper introduces a physics-informed (PI) RL algorithm that integrates a differentiable power flow model and voltage-based reward design into the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm, enabling EVs to deliver real-time voltage support while meeting user demands. The resulting PI-TD3 algorithm achieves faster convergence, improved sample efficiency, and reliable voltage magnitude regulation under uncertain and overloaded conditions. Benchmarks on the IEEE 34-bus and 123-bus networks show that the proposed PI-TD3 outperforms both model-free RL and optimization-based baselines in grid constraint management, user satisfaction, and economic metrics, even as the system scales to hundreds of EVs. These advances enable robust, scalable, and practical EV charging strategies that enhance grid resilience and support distribution networks operation.

Title: Resilient Full-Duplex ISAC in the Face of Imperfect SI Cancellation: Globally Optimal Timeslot Allocation and Beam Selection
Authors: Luis F. Abanto-Leon, Setareh Maghsudi
Abstract: This work addresses the radio resource management (RRM) design in downlink full-duplex integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, jointly optimizing timeslot allocation and beam selection under imperfect self-interference cancellation. Timeslot allocation governs the distribution of discrete channel uses between sensing and communication tasks, while beam selection determines transmit and receive directions along with adaptive beamwidths. The joint design leads to a semi-infinite, nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is difficult to solve. To overcome this, we develop a tailored reformulation strategy that transforms the problem into a tractable mixed-integer linear program (MILP), enabling globally optimal solutions. Our approach provides insights into the coordinated optimization of timeslot allocation and beam selection, enhancing the efficiency of full-duplex ISAC systems while ensuring resilience against residual self-interference.

Title: Source-Free Domain Adaptation for SSVEP-based Brain-Computer Interfaces
Authors: Osman Berke Guney, Deniz Kucukahmetler, Huseyin Ozkan
Abstract: Objective: SSVEP-based BCI spellers assist individuals experiencing speech difficulties by enabling them to communicate at a fast rate. However, achieving a high information transfer rate (ITR) in most prominent methods requires an extensive calibration period before using the system, leading to discomfort for new users. We address this issue by proposing a novel method that adapts a powerful deep neural network (DNN) pre-trained on data from source domains (data from former users or participants of previous experiments), to the new user (target domain) using only unlabeled target data. Approach: Our method adapts the pre-trained DNN to the new user by minimizing our proposed custom loss function composed of self-adaptation and local-regularity terms. The self-adaptation term uses the pseudo-label strategy, while the novel local-regularity term exploits the data structure and forces the DNN to assign similar labels to adjacent instances. Main results: Our method achieves excellent ITRs of 201.15 bits/min and 145.02 bits/min on the benchmark and BETA datasets, respectively, and outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives. Our code is available at this https URL Significance: The proposed method prioritizes user comfort by removing the burden of calibration while maintaining an excellent character identification accuracy and ITR. Because of these attributes, our approach could significantly accelerate the adoption of BCI systems into everyday life.

Title: Phase-driven Domain Generalizable Learning for Nonstationary Time Series
Authors: Payal Mohapatra, Lixu Wang, Qi Zhu
Abstract: Pattern recognition is a fundamental task in continuous sensing applications, but real-world scenarios often experience distribution shifts that necessitate learning generalizable representations for such tasks. This challenge is exacerbated with time-series data, which also exhibit inherent nonstationarity--variations in statistical and spectral properties over time. In this work, we offer a fresh perspective on learning generalizable representations for time-series classification by considering the phase information of a signal as an approximate proxy for nonstationarity and propose a phase-driven generalizable representation learning framework for time-series classification, PhASER. It consists of three key elements: 1) Hilbert transform-based augmentation, which diversifies nonstationarity while preserving task-specific discriminatory semantics, 2) separate magnitude-phase encoding, viewing time-varying magnitude and phase as independent modalities, and 3) phase-residual feature broadcasting, integrating 2D phase features with a residual connection to the 1D signal representation, providing inherent regularization to improve distribution-invariant learning. Extensive evaluations on five datasets from sleep-stage classification, human activity recognition, and gesture recognition against 13 state-of-the-art baseline methods demonstrate that PhASER consistently outperforms the best baselines by an average of 5% and up to 11% in some cases. Additionally, the principles of PhASER can be broadly applied to enhance the generalizability of existing time-series representation learning models.

Title: LookUp3D: Data-Driven 3D Scanning
Authors: Giancarlo Pereira, Yidan Gao, Yurii Piadyk, David Fouhey, Claudio T Silva, Daniele Panozzo
Abstract: High speed, high-resolution, and accurate 3D scanning would open doors to many new applications in graphics, robotics, science, and medicine by enabling the accurate scanning of deformable objects during interactions. Past attempts to use structured light, time-of-flight, and stereo in high-speed settings have usually required tradeoffs in resolution or inaccuracy. In this paper, we introduce a method that enables, for the first time, 3D scanning at 450 frames per second at 1~Megapixel, or 1,450 frames per second at 0.4~Megapixel in an environment with controlled lighting. The key idea is to use a per-pixel lookup table that maps colors to depths, which is built using a linear stage. Imperfections, such as lens-distortion and sensor defects are baked into the calibration. We describe our method and test it on a novel hardware prototype. We compare the system with both ground-truth geometry as well as commercially available dynamic sensors like the Microsoft Kinect and Intel Realsense. Our results show the system acquiring geometry of objects undergoing high-speed deformations and oscillations and demonstrate the ability to recover physical properties from the reconstructions.

Title: Planning of Off-Grid Renewable Power to Ammonia Systems with Heterogeneous Flexibility: A Multistakeholder Equilibrium Perspective
Authors: Yangjun Zeng (1), Yiwei Qiu (1), Jie Zhu (1), Shi Chen (1), Tianlei Zang (1), Buxiang Zhou (1), Ge He (2), Xu Ji (2) ((1) College of Electrical Engineering, Sichuan University, (2) School of Chemical Engineering, Sichuan University)
Abstract: Off-grid renewable power to ammonia (ReP2A) systems present a promising pathway toward carbon neutrality in both the energy and chemical industries. However, due to chemical safety requirements, the limited flexibility of ammonia synthesis poses a challenge when attempting to align with the variable hydrogen flow produced from renewable power. This necessitates the optimal sizing of equipment capacity for effective and coordinated production across the system. Additionally, an ReP2A system may involve multiple stakeholders with varying degrees of operational flexibility, complicating the planning problem. This paper first examines the multistakeholder sizing equilibrium (MSSE) of the ReP2A system. First, we propose an MSSE model that accounts for individual planning decisions and the competing economic interests of the stakeholders of power generation, hydrogen production, and ammonia synthesis. We then construct an equivalent optimization problem based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions to determine the equilibrium. Following this, we decompose the problem in the temporal dimension and solve it via multicut generalized Benders decomposition (GBD) to address long-term balancing issues. Case studies based on a realistic project reveal that the equilibrium does not naturally balance the interests of all stakeholders due to their heterogeneous characteristics. Our findings suggest that benefit transfer or re-arrangement ensure mutual benefits and the successful implementation of ReP2A projects.

Title: Learning Differential Pyramid Representation for Tone Mapping
Authors: Qirui Yang, Yinbo Li, Yihao Liu, Peng-Tao Jiang, Fangpu Zhang, Qihua Cheng, Huanjing Yue, Jingyu Yang
Abstract: Existing tone mapping methods operate on downsampled inputs and rely on handcrafted pyramids to recover high-frequency details. These designs typically fail to preserve fine textures and structural fidelity in complex HDR scenes. Furthermore, most methods lack an effective mechanism to jointly model global tone consistency and local contrast enhancement, leading to globally flat or locally inconsistent outputs such as halo artifacts. We present the Differential Pyramid Representation Network (DPRNet), an end-to-end framework for high-fidelity tone mapping. At its core is a learnable differential pyramid that generalizes traditional Laplacian and Difference-of-Gaussian pyramids through content-aware differencing operations across scales. This allows DPRNet to adaptively capture high-frequency variations under diverse luminance and contrast conditions. To enforce perceptual consistency, DPRNet incorporates global tone perception and local tone tuning modules operating on downsampled inputs, enabling efficient yet expressive tone adaptation. Finally, an iterative detail enhancement module progressively restores the full-resolution output in a coarse-to-fine manner, reinforcing structure and sharpness. Experiments show that DPRNet achieves state-of-the-art results, improving PSNR by 2.39 dB on the 4K HDR+ dataset and 3.01 dB on the 4K HDRI Haven dataset, while producing perceptually coherent, detail-preserving results. \textit{We provide an anonymous online demo at this https URL.

Title: Learn More by Using Less: Distributed Learning with Energy-Constrained Devices
Authors: Roberto Pereira, Cristian J. Vaca-Rubio, Luis Blanco
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a solution for distributed model training across decentralized, privacy-preserving devices, but the different energy capacities of participating devices (system heterogeneity) constrain real-world implementations. These energy limitations not only reduce model accuracy but also increase dropout rates, impacting on convergence in practical FL deployments. In this work, we propose LeanFed, an energy-aware FL framework designed to optimize client selection and training workloads on battery-constrained devices. LeanFed leverages adaptive data usage by dynamically adjusting the fraction of local data each device utilizes during training, thereby maximizing device participation across communication rounds while ensuring they do not run out of battery during the process. We rigorously evaluate LeanFed against traditional FedAvg on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, simulating various levels of data heterogeneity and device participation rates. Results show that LeanFed consistently enhances model accuracy and stability, particularly in settings with high data heterogeneity and limited battery life, by mitigating client dropout and extending device availability. This approach demonstrates the potential of energy-efficient, privacy-preserving FL in real-world, large-scale applications, setting a foundation for robust and sustainable pervasive AI on resource-constrained networks.

Title: Finite Sample Identification of Partially Observed Bilinear Dynamical Systems
Authors: Yahya Sattar, Yassir Jedra, Maryam Fazel, Sarah Dean
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a realization of a partially observed bilinear dynamical system (BLDS) from noisy input-output data. Given a single trajectory of input-output samples, we provide a finite time analysis for learning the system's Markov-like parameters, from which a balanced realization of the bilinear system can be obtained. Our bilinear system identification algorithm learns the system's Markov-like parameters by regressing the outputs to highly correlated, nonlinear, and heavy-tailed covariates. Moreover, the stability of BLDS depends on the sequence of inputs used to excite the system. These properties, unique to partially observed bilinear dynamical systems, pose significant challenges to the analysis of our algorithm for learning the unknown dynamics. We address these challenges and provide high probability error bounds on our identification algorithm under a uniform stability assumption. Our analysis provides insights into system theoretic quantities that affect learning accuracy and sample complexity. Lastly, we perform numerical experiments with synthetic data to reinforce these insights.

Title: Optimal Investment Portfolio of Thyristor- and IGBT-based Electrolysis Rectifiers in Utility-scale Renewable P2H Systems
Authors: Yangjun Zeng (1), Yiwei Qiu (1), Liuchao Xu (1), Chenjia Gu (1), Yi Zhou (1), Jiarong Li (2), Shi Chen (1), Buxiang Zhou (1) ((1) College of Electrical Engineering, Sichuan University, (2) Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences)
Abstract: Renewable power-to-hydrogen (ReP2H) systems require rectifiers to supply power to electrolyzers (ELZs). Two main types of rectifiers, insulated-gate bipolar transistor rectifiers (IGBT-Rs) and thyristor rectifiers (TRs), offer distinct tradeoffs. IGBT-Rs provide flexible reactive power control but are costly, whereas TRs are more affordable with lower power loss but consume a large amount of uncontrollable reactive power. A mixed configuration of rectifiers in utility-scale ReP2H systems could achieve a decent tradeoff and increase overall profitability. To explore this potential, this paper proposes an optimal investment portfolio model. First, we model and compare the active and reactive power characteristics of ELZs powered by TRs and IGBT-Rs. Second, we consider the investment of ELZs, rectifiers, and var resources and coordinate the operation of renewables, energy storage, var resources, and the on-off switching and load allocation of multiple ELZs. Subsequently, a two-stage stochastic programming (SP) model based on weighted information gap decision theory (W-IGDT) is developed to address the uncertainties of the renewable power and hydrogen price, and we apply the progressive hedging (PH) algorithm to accelerate its solution. Case studies demonstrate that optimal rectifier configurations increase revenue by at most 13.78% compared with configurations using only TRs or IGBT-Rs, existing project setups, or intuitive designs. Under the optimal portfolio, reactive power compensation investment is nearly eliminated, with a preferred TR-to-IGBT-R ratio of 3:1.

Title: Wireless Hearables With Programmable Speech AI Accelerators
Authors: Malek Itani, Tuochao Chen, Arun Raghavan, Gavriel Kohlberg, Shyamnath Gollakota
Abstract: The conventional wisdom has been that designing ultra-compact, battery-constrained wireless hearables with on-device speech AI models is challenging due to the high computational demands of streaming deep learning models. Speech AI models require continuous, real-time audio processing, imposing strict computational and I/O constraints. We present NeuralAids, a fully on-device speech AI system for wireless hearables, enabling real-time speech enhancement and denoising on compact, battery-constrained devices. Our system bridges the gap between state-of-the-art deep learning for speech enhancement and low-power AI hardware by making three key technical contributions: 1) a wireless hearable platform integrating a speech AI accelerator for efficient on-device streaming inference, 2) an optimized dual-path neural network designed for low-latency, high-quality speech enhancement, and 3) a hardware-software co-design that uses mixed-precision quantization and quantization-aware training to achieve real-time performance under strict power constraints. Our system processes 6 ms audio chunks in real-time, achieving an inference time of 5.54 ms while consuming 71.6 mW. In real-world evaluations, including a user study with 28 participants, our system outperforms prior on-device models in speech quality and noise suppression, paving the way for next-generation intelligent wireless hearables that can enhance hearing entirely on-device.

Title: Sub-optimality of the Separation Principle for Quadratic Control from Bilinear Observations
Authors: Yahya Sattar, Sunmook Choi, Yassir Jedra, Maryam Fazel, Sarah Dean
Abstract: We consider the problem of controlling a linear dynamical system from bilinear observations with minimal quadratic cost. Despite the similarity of this problem to standard linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control, we show that when the observation model is bilinear, neither does the Separation Principle hold, nor is the optimal controller affine in the estimated state. Moreover, the cost-to-go is non-convex in the control input. Hence, finding an analytical expression for the optimal feedback controller is difficult in general. Under certain settings, we show that the standard LQG controller locally maximizes the cost instead of minimizing it. Furthermore, the optimal controllers (derived analytically) are not unique and are nonlinear in the estimated state. We also introduce a notion of input-dependent observability and derive conditions under which the Kalman filter covariance remains bounded. We illustrate our theoretical results through numerical experiments in multiple synthetic settings.

Title: A Multi-Task Foundation Model for Wireless Channel Representation Using Contrastive and Masked Autoencoder Learning
Authors: Berkay Guler, Giovanni Geraci, Hamid Jafarkhani
Abstract: Current applications of self-supervised learning to wireless channel representation often borrow paradigms developed for text and image processing, without fully addressing the unique characteristics and constraints of wireless communications. To bridge this gap, we introduce ContraWiMAE, Wireless Contrastive Masked Autoencoder, a transformer-based foundation model that unifies masked reconstruction and masked contrastive learning for wireless channel representation. Our key innovation is a new wireless-inspired contrastive objective that exploits the inherent characteristics of wireless environment, including noise, fading, and partial observability, as natural augmentation. Through extensive evaluation on unseen scenarios and conditions, we demonstrate our method's effectiveness in multiple downstream tasks, including cross-frequency beam selection, line-of-sight detection, and channel estimation. ContraWiMAE exhibits superior linear separability and adaptability in diverse wireless environments, demonstrating exceptional data efficiency and competitive performance compared with supervised baselines under challenging conditions. Comparative evaluations against a state-of-the-art wireless channel foundation model confirm the superior performance and data efficiency of our approach, highlighting its potential as a powerful baseline for future research in self-supervised wireless channel representation learning. To foster further work in this direction, we release the model weights and training pipeline for ContraWiMAE.

Title: Optimal and Suboptimal Decoders under Finite-Alphabet Interference: A Mismatched Decoding Perspective
Authors: Sibo Zhang, Bruno Clerckx
Abstract: Interference widely exists in communication systems and is often not optimally treated at the receivers due to limited knowledge and/or computational burden. Evolutions of receivers have been proposed to balance complexity and spectral efficiency, for example, for 6G, while commonly used performance metrics, such as capacity and mutual information (MI), fail to capture the suboptimal treatment of interference, leading to potentially inaccurate performance evaluations. Mismatched decoding is an information-theoretic tool for analyzing communications with suboptimal decoders. In this work, we use mismatched decoding to analyze communications with decoders that treat interference suboptimally, aiming at more accurate performance metrics. Specifically, we consider a finite-alphabet input Gaussian channel under interference, representative of modern systems, where the decoder can be matched (optimal) or mismatched (suboptimal) to the channel. The matched capacity is derived using MI, while a lower bound on the mismatched capacity under various decoding metrics is derived using generalized mutual information (GMI). We show that the decoding metric in the proposed channel model is closely related to the behavior of the demodulator in bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) systems. Simulations illustrate that GMI/MI accurately predicts the throughput of BICM-type systems {with various demodulators}. Finally, we extend the channel model and the GMI to multiple antenna cases, with an example of multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) precoder optimization problem considering GMI under different decoding strategies. In short, this work discovers new insights about the impact of interference, proposes novel receivers, and introduces a new design and performance evaluation framework that more accurately captures the effect of interference.

Title: QPPG: Quantum-Preconditioned Policy Gradient for Link Adaptation in Rayleigh Fading Channels
Authors: Oluwaseyi Giwa, Muhammad Ahmed Mohsin, Folarin Jubril Adesola, Muhammad Ali Jamshed
Abstract: Reliable link adaptation is critical for efficient wireless communications in dynamic fading environments. However, reinforcement learning (RL) solutions often suffer from unstable convergence due to poorly conditioned policy gradients, hindering their practical application. We propose the quantum-preconditioned policy gradient (QPPG) algorithm, which leverages Fisher-information-based preconditioning to stabilise and accelerate policy updates. Evaluations in Rayleigh fading scenarios show that QPPG achieves faster convergence, a 28.6% increase in average throughput, and a 43.8% decrease in average transmit power compared to classical methods. This work introduces quantum-geometric conditioning to link adaptation, marking a significant advance in developing robust, quantum-inspired reinforcement learning for future 6G networks, thereby enhancing communication reliability and energy efficiency.

Title: Efficient Interleaved Speech Modeling through Knowledge Distillation
Authors: Mohammadmahdi Nouriborji, Morteza Rohanian
Abstract: Current speech language models exceed the size and latency constraints of many deployment environments. We build compact, expressive speech generation models through layer-aligned distillation, matching hidden states, attention maps, and softened logits to compress large multimodal transformers by 3x with minimal loss in performance. We introduce TinyWave, a family of 2B-parameter models for speech-to-speech and interleaved speech-text generation, trained on 50,000 hours of public audio. TinyWave supports (i) speech-only generation using phonetic or expressive tokens and (ii) mixed speech-text continuations. Evaluation on Libri-Light shows TinyWave within 1.4 normalized perplexity points of its teacher. Accuracy on spoken StoryCloze and SALMon reaches 93-97% of the teacher's performance, outperforming size-matched baselines. These models are optimized for deployment on commodity hardware, enabling applications in real-time conversational agents, assistive technologies, and low-resource environments. We release models, training code, and evaluation scripts to support reproducible research on compact, expressive speech generation.

Title: Intelligent Software System for Low-Cost, Brightfield Segmentation: Algorithmic Implementation for Cytometric Auto-Analysis
Authors: Surajit Das, Pavel Zun
Abstract: Bright-field microscopy, a cost-effective solution for live-cell culture, is often the only resource available, along with standard CPUs, for many low-budget labs. The inherent chal- lenges of bright-field images - their noisiness, low contrast, and dynamic morphology - coupled with a lack of GPU resources and complex software interfaces, hinder the desired research output. This article presents a novel microscopy image analysis frame- work designed for low-budget labs equipped with a standard CPU desktop. The Python-based program enables cytometric analysis of live, unstained cells in culture through an advanced computer vision and machine learning pipeline. Crucially, the framework operates on label-free data, requiring no manually annotated training data or training phase. It is accessible via a user-friendly, cross-platform GUI that requires no programming skills, while also providing a scripting interface for programmatic control and integration by developers. The end-to-end workflow performs semantic and instance segmentation, feature extraction, analysis, evaluation, and automated report generation. Its modular archi- tecture supports easy maintenance and flexible integration while supporting both single-image and batch processing. Validated on several unstained cell types from the public dataset of livecells, the framework demonstrates superior accuracy and reproducibility compared to contemporary tools like Cellpose and StarDist. Its competitive segmentation speed on a CPU-based platform highlights its significant potential for basic research and clinical applications - particularly in cell transplantation for personalised medicine and muscle regeneration therapies. The access to the application is available for reproducibility
