Title: Targeted Resilient Zoning for High Impact Events via Multi Circuit Polelines
Authors: Hritik Gopal Shah, Gregory Giustino, Elli Ntakou
Abstract: The increasing frequency and severity of High Impact and Low Probability events such as hurricanes and windstorms pose significant challenges to the resilience of electrical power distribution systems, particularly in regions of New England where there is a significant amount of overhead infrastructure in areas where vegetation is predominant. Traditional reliability-focused planning is insufficient to address the systemic vulnerabilities exposed by such extreme events. This paper presents a novel risk based framework for long term resilience planning of active overhead distribution systems, with a specific focus on mitigating the impacts of high wind and hurricane induced outages.

Title: Reading Radio from Camera: Visually-Grounded, Lightweight, and Interpretable RSSI Prediction
Authors: Sen Yan, Tianyu Hu, Brahim Mefgouda, Samson Lasaulce, Merouane Debbah
Abstract: Accurate, real-time wireless signal prediction is essential for next-generation networks. However, existing vision-based frameworks often rely on computationally intensive models and are also sensitive to environmental interference. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel, physics-guided and light-weighted framework that predicts the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) from camera images. By decomposing RSSI into its physically interpretable components, path loss and shadow fading, we significantly reduce the model's learning difficulty and exhibit interpretability. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art by demonstrating exceptional robustness to environmental interference, a critical flaw in prior work. Quantitatively, our model reduces the prediction root mean squared error (RMSE) by 50.3% under conventional conditions and still achieves an 11.5% lower RMSE than the previous benchmark's interference-eliminated results. This superior performance is achieved with a remarkably lightweight framework, utilizing a MobileNet-based model up to 19 times smaller than competing solutions. The combination of high accuracy, robustness to interference, and computational efficiency makes our framework highly suitable for real-time, on-device deployment in edge devices, paving the way for more intelligent and reliable wireless communication systems.

Title: SPEAR: A Unified SSL Framework for Learning Speech and Audio Representations
Authors: Xiaoyu Yang, Yifan Yang, Zengrui Jin, Ziyun Cui, Wen Wu, Baoxiang Li, Chao Zhang, Phil Woodland
Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) excels at learning generic representations of acoustic signals, yet prevailing methods remain domain-specific, tailored to either speech or general audio, hindering the development of a unified representation model with a comprehensive capability over both domains. To address this, we present SPEAR (SPEech and Audio Representations), the first SSL framework to successfully learn unified speech and audio representations from a mixture of speech and audio data. SPEAR proposes a unified pre-training objective based on masked prediction of fine-grained discrete tokens for both speech and general audio. These tokens are derived from continuous speech and audio representations using a Multi-codebook Vector Quantisation (MVQ) method, retaining rich acoustic detail essential for modelling both speech and complex audio events. SPEAR is applied to pre-train both single-domain and unified speech-and-audio SSL models. Our speech-domain model establishes a new state-of-the-art on the SUPERB benchmark, a speech processing benchmark for SSL models, matching or surpassing the highly competitive WavLM Large on 12 out of 15 tasks with the same pre-training corpora and a similar model size. Crucially, our unified model learns complementary features and demonstrates comprehensive capabilities across two major benchmarks, SUPERB and HEAR, for evaluating audio representations. By further scaling up the model size and pre-training data, we present a unified model with 600M parameters that excels in both domains, establishing it as one of the most powerful and versatile open-source SSL models for auditory understanding. The inference code and pre-trained models will be made publicly available.

Title: Groupwise Registration with Physics-Informed Test-Time Adaptation on Multi-parametric Cardiac MRI
Authors: Xinqi Li, Yi Zhang, Li-Ting Huang, Hsiao-Huang Chang, Thoralf Niendorf, Min-Chi Ku, Qian Tao, Hsin-Jung Yang
Abstract: Multiparametric mapping MRI has become a viable tool for myocardial tissue characterization. However, misalignment between multiparametric maps makes pixel-wise analysis challenging. To address this challenge, we developed a generalizable physics-informed deep-learning model using test-time adaptation to enable group image registration across contrast weighted images acquired from multiple physical models (e.g., a T1 mapping model and T2 mapping model). The physics-informed adaptation utilized the synthetic images from specific physics model as registration reference, allows for transductive learning for various tissue contrast. We validated the model in healthy volunteers with various MRI sequences, demonstrating its improvement for multi-modal registration with a wide range of image contrast variability.

Title: Competitive Equilibrium for Electricity Markets with Spatially Flexible Load
Authors: Nan Gu, Junjie Qin
Abstract: Electric vehicle charging and geo-distributed datacenters introduce spatially flexible loads (FLs) that couple power, transportation, and datacenter networks. These couplings create a closed-loop feedback between locational marginal prices (LMPs) and decisions of the FL systems, challenging the foundations of conventional competitive equilibrium (CE) in electricity markets. This paper studies a notion of generalized competitive equilibrium (GCE) that aims to capture such price-demand interactions across the interconnected infrastructures. We establish structural conditions under which the GCE preserves key properties of the conventional CE, including existence, uniqueness, and efficiency, without requiring detailed knowledge of decision processes for individual FL systems. The framework generalizes to settings where the grid is coupled with multiple FL systems. Stylized examples and case studies on the New York ISO grid, coupled with the Sioux Falls transportation and distributed datacenter networks, demonstrate the use of our theoretical framework and illustrate the mutual influence among the grid and the studied FL systems.

Title: A Scenario-Based Approach for Stochastic Economic Model Predictive Control with an Expected Shortfall Constraint
Authors: Alireza Arastou, Algo Car√®, Ye Wang, Marco Campi, Erik Weyer
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to stochastic economic model predictive control (SEMPC) that minimizes average economic cost while satisfying an empirical expected shortfall (EES) constraint to manage risk. A new scenario-based problem formulation ensuring controlled risk with high confidence while minimizing the average cost is introduced. The probabilistic guarantees is dependent on the number of support elements over the entire input domain, which is difficult to find for high-dimensional systems. A heuristic algorithm is proposed to find the number of support elements. Finally, an efficient method is presented to reduce the computational complexity of the SEMPC problem with an EES constraint. The approach is validated on a water distribution network, showing its effectiveness in balancing performance and risk.

Title: Lightweight Ac Arc Fault Diagnosis via Fourier Transform Inspired Multi-frequency Neural Network
Authors: Qianchao Wang, Chuanzhen Jia, Yuxuan Ding, Zhe Li, Yaping Du
Abstract: Lightweight online detection of series arc faults is critically needed in residential and industrial power systems to prevent electrical fires. Existing diagnostic methods struggle to achieve both rapid response and robust accuracy under resource-constrained conditions. To overcome the challenge, this work suggests leveraging a multi-frequency neural network named MFNN, embedding prior physical knowledge into the network. Inspired by arcing current curve and the Fourier decomposition analysis, we create an adaptive activation function with super-expressiveness, termed EAS, and a novel network architecture with branch networks to help MFNN extract features with multiple frequencies. In our experiments, eight advanced arc fault diagnosis models across an experimental dataset with multiple sampling times and multi-level noise are used to demonstrate the superiority of MFNN. The corresponding experiments show: 1) The MFNN outperforms other models in arc fault location, befitting from signal decomposition of branch networks. 2) The noise immunity of MFNN is much better than that of other models, achieving 14.51% over LCNN and 16.3% over BLS in test accuracy when SNR=-9. 3) EAS and the network architecture contribute to the excellent performance of MFNN.

Title: Robust Super-Capacity SRS Channel Inpainting via Diffusion Models
Authors: Usman Akram, Fan Zhang, Yang Li, Haris Vikalo
Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is essential for reliable multiuser MIMO operation. In 5G NR, reciprocity-based beamforming via uplink Sounding Reference Signals (SRS) face resource and coverage constraints, motivating sparse non-uniform SRS allocation. Prior masked-autoencoder (MAE) approaches improve coverage but overfit to training masks and degrade under unseen distortions (e.g., additional masking, interference, clipping, non-Gaussian noise). We propose a diffusion-based channel inpainting framework that integrates system-model knowledge at inference via a likelihood-gradient term, enabling a single trained model to adapt across mismatched conditions. On standardized CDL channels, the score-based diffusion variant consistently outperforms a UNet score-model baseline and the one-step MAE under distribution shift, with improvements up to 14 dB NMSE in challenging settings (e.g., Laplace noise, user interference), while retaining competitive accuracy under matched conditions. These results demonstrate that diffusion-guided inpainting is a robust and generalizable approach for super-capacity SRS design in 5G NR systems.

Title: Functional Connectome Fingerprinting Using Convolutional and Dictionary Learning
Authors: Yashaswini, Sanjay Ghosh
Abstract: Advances in data analysis and machine learning have revolutionized the study of brain signatures using fMRI, enabling non-invasive exploration of cognition and behavior through individual neural patterns. Functional connectivity (FC), which quantifies statistical relationships between brain regions, has emerged as a key metric for studying individual variability and developing biomarkers for personalized medicine in neurological and psychiatric disorders. The concept of subject fingerprinting, introduced by Finn et al. (2015), leverages neural connectivity variability to identify individuals based on their unique patterns. While traditional FC methods perform well on small datasets, machine learning techniques are more effective with larger datasets, isolating individual-specific features and maximizing inter-subject differences. In this study, we propose a framework combining convolutional autoencoders and sparse dictionary learning to enhance fingerprint accuracy. Autoencoders capture shared connectivity patterns while isolating subject-specific features in residual FC matrices, which are analyzed using sparse coding to identify distinctive features. Tested on the Human Connectome Project dataset, this approach achieved a 10% improvement over baseline group-averaged FC models. Our results highlight the potential of integrating deep learning and sparse coding techniques for scalable and robust functional connectome fingerprinting, advancing personalized neuroscience applications and biomarker development.

Title: Green Wireless Network Scaling for Joint Deployment: Multi-BSs or Multi-RISs?
Authors: Tao Yu, Simin Wang, Shunqing Zhang, Mingyao Cui, Kaibin Huang, Wen Chen, QingQing Wu, Jihong Li, Kaixuan Huang
Abstract: The imminent emergence of sixth-generation (6G) networks faces critical challenges from spatially heterogeneous traffic and escalating energy consumption, necessitating sustainable scaling strategies for network infrastructure such as base stations (BSs) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). This paper establishes fundamental scaling laws for the Integrated Relative Energy Efficiency (IREE) metric under joint multi-BS and multi-RIS deployment in traffic-mismatched scenarios. Specifically, we propose an Alternating Directional Dual-Radial Basis Function (ADD-RBF) framework that models the channels of BSs and RISs as two type of spatially decoupled RBF neurons to maximize IREE through alternative optimization, with proven universal approximation capability and convergence guarantees. Theoretical analysis reveals a scaling dichotomy: BS proliferation drives logarithmic capacity growth $\mathcal{O}(\log N^{BS})$ but only polynomial mismatch reduction $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{N^{BS}})$, whereas RIS deployment achieves exponential mismatch mitigation $\mathcal{O}(\delta_{\text{err}}^{-(N^R+1)})$ despite its sub-logarithmic capacity gains. Simulation results validate that RISs excel in capturing spatial traffic correlations and alleviating hotspots, making them particularly effective when mismatch dominates, while BSs are preferable under capacity shortages. These findings offer practical guidelines for green 6G network design.

Title: Virtual-Real Collaborated Split Learning via Model Partitioning in IRS-Assisted IoT Networks
Authors: Jiaying Di, Kunlun Wang, Jing Xu, Wen Chen, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel computation and communication co-design framework for large-scale split learning in intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted internet of things (IoT) networks integrated with digital twin (DT) technique. The considered system consists of a multi-antenna access point (AP), multiple heterogeneous user devices (UDs), and an deployed IRS to enhance both uplink and downlink transmission. The training process of a deep neural network is partitioned between devices and the AP, where a DT replica is activated to replace UDs with insufficient local computation capabilities. We formulate a delay-optimal split learning problem, which optimizes five key variables: layer partitioning points, DT assignment decisions, IRS phase shift matrix, AP downlink power allocation, and DT frequency adjustment, aiming to minimize the overall end-to-end delay under communication and computation. The proposed optimization problem is a highly coupled non-convex mixed-integer problem. Therefore, we solve using an alternating optimization approach combining closed-form updates, semidefinite relaxation (SDR), and low-complexity heuristics. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly reduces training delay compared to conventional baselines and achieves up to 35\% delay improvement, especially under high UD density and stringent power constraints.

Title: 6D Channel Knowledge Map Construction via Bidirectional Wireless Gaussian Splatting
Authors: Juncong Zhou, Chao Hu, Guanlin Wu, Zixiang Ren, Han Hu, Juyong Zhang, Rui Zhang, Jie Xu
Abstract: This paper investigates the construction of channel knowledge map (CKM) from sparse channel measurements. Dif ferent from conventional two-/three-dimensional (2D/3D) CKM approaches assuming fixed base station configurations, we present a six-dimensional (6D) CKM framework named bidirectional wireless Gaussian splatting (BiWGS), which is capable of mod eling wireless channels across dynamic transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) positions in 3D space. BiWGS uses Gaussian el lipsoids to represent virtual scatterer clusters and environmental obstacles in the wireless environment. By properly learning the bidirectional scattering patterns and complex attenuation profiles based on channel measurements, these ellipsoids inherently cap ture the electromagnetic transmission characteristics of wireless environments, thereby accurately modeling signal transmission under varying transceiver configurations. Experiment results show that BiWGS significantly outperforms classic multi-layer perception (MLP) for the construction of 6D channel power gain map with varying Tx-Rx positions, and achieves spatial spectrum prediction accuracy comparable to the state-of-the art wireless radiation field Gaussian splatting (WRF-GS) for 3D CKM construction. This validates the capability of the proposed BiWGS in accomplishing dimensional expansion of 6D CKM construction, without compromising fidelity.

Title: BitSemCom: A Bit-Level Semantic Communication Framework with Learnable Probabilistic Mapping
Authors: Haoshuo Zhang, Yufei Bo, Jianhua Mo, Meixia Tao
Abstract: Most existing semantic communication systems employ analog modulation, which is incompatible with modern digital communication systems. Although several digital transmission approaches have been proposed to address this issue, an end-to-end bit-level method that is compatible with arbitrary modulation formats, robust to channel noise, and free from quantization errors remains lacking. To this end, we propose BitSemCom, a novel bit-level semantic communication framework that realizes true joint source-channel coding (JSCC) at the bit level. Specifically, we introduce a modular learnable bit mapper that establishes a probabilistic mapping between continuous semantic features and discrete bits, utilizing the Gumbel-Softmax trick to enable differentiable bit generation. Simulation results on image transmission demonstrate that BitSemCom achieves both competitive performance and superior robustness compared to traditional separate source-channel coding (SSCC) schemes, and outperforms deep learning based JSCC with uniform 1-bit quantization, validating the effectiveness of the learnable bit mapper. Despite these improvements, the bit mapper adds only 0.42% parameters and 0.09% computational complexity, making BitSemCom a lightweight and practical solution for real-world semantic communication.

Title: Design of Orthogonal Phase of Arrival Positioning Scheme Based on 5G PRS and Optimization of TOA Performance
Authors: Juyeop Kim, Hyejin Shin, Sohee Kim, Ilmu Byun
Abstract: This study analyzes the performance of positioning techniques based on configuration changes of 5G New Radio signals. In 5G networks, a terminal position is determined from the Time of Arrival of Positioning Reference Signals transmitted by base stations. We propose an algorithm that improves TOA accuracy under low sampling rate constraints and implement 5G PRS for positioning in a software defined modem. We also examine how flexible time frequency resource allocation of PRS affects TOA estimation accuracy and discuss optimal PRS configurations for a given signal environment.

Title: Optimal transmit field distribution for partially obstructed continuous radiating surfaces in near-field communication systems
Authors: Francesco Verde, Donatella Darsena, Marco Di Renzo, Vincenzo Galdi
Abstract: This paper deals with the optimal synthesis of aperture fields for (radiating) near-field communications in obstructed environments. A physically consistent model based on knife-edge diffraction is used to formulate the problem as a maximization in Hilbert space. The optimal solution is obtained as a matched filter that ``matches" the shape of a diffraction-induced kernel, thus linking wave propagation with signal processing methods. The framework supports hardware implementation using continuous apertures such as metasurfaces or lens antennas. This approach bridges physically grounded modeling, signal processing, and hardware design for efficient energy focusing in near-field obstructed channels.

Title: SABER: Symbolic Regression-based Angle of Arrival and Beam Pattern Estimator
Authors: Shih-Kai Chou, Mengran Zhao, Cheng-Nan Hu, Kuang-Chung Chou, Carolina Fortuna, Jernej Hribar
Abstract: Accurate Angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation is essential for next-generation wireless communication systems to enable reliable beamforming, high-precision localization, and integrated sensing. Unfortunately, classical high-resolution techniques require multi-element arrays and extensive snapshot collection, while generic Machine Learning (ML) approaches often yield black-box models that lack physical interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a Symbolic Regression (SR)-based ML framework. Namely, Symbolic Regression-based Angle of Arrival and Beam Pattern Estimator (SABER), a constrained symbolic-regression framework that automatically discovers closed-form beam pattern and AoA models from path loss measurements with interpretability. SABER achieves high accuracy while bridging the gap between opaque ML methods and interpretable physics-driven estimators. First, we validate our approach in a controlled free-space anechoic chamber, showing that both direct inversion of the known $\cos^n$ beam and a low-order polynomial surrogate achieve sub-0.5 degree Mean Absolute Error (MAE). A purely unconstrained SR method can further reduce the error of the predicted angles, but produces complex formulas that lack physical insight. Then, we implement the same SR-learned inversions in a real-world, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided indoor testbed. SABER and unconstrained SR models accurately recover the true AoA with near-zero error. Finally, we benchmark SABER against the Cram√©r-Rao Lower Bounds (CRLBs). Our results demonstrate that SABER is an interpretable and accurate alternative to state-of-the-art and black-box ML-based methods for AoA estimation.

Title: From Embedding to Control: Representations for Stochastic Multi-Object Systems
Authors: Xiaoyuan Cheng, Yiming Yang, Wei Jiang, Chenyang Yuan, Zhuo Sun, Yukun Hu
Abstract: This paper studies how to achieve accurate modeling and effective control in stochastic nonlinear dynamics with multiple interacting objects. However, non-uniform interactions and random topologies make this task challenging. We address these challenges by proposing \textit{Graph Controllable Embeddings} (GCE), a general framework to learn stochastic multi-object dynamics for linear control. Specifically, GCE is built on Hilbert space embeddings, allowing direct embedding of probability distributions of controlled stochastic dynamics into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), which enables linear operations in its RKHS while retaining nonlinear expressiveness. We provide theoretical guarantees on the existence, convergence, and applicability of GCE. Notably, a mean field approximation technique is adopted to efficiently capture inter-object dependencies and achieve provably low sample complexity. By integrating graph neural networks, we construct data-dependent kernel features that are capable of adapting to dynamic interaction patterns and generalizing to even unseen topologies with only limited training instances. GCE scales seamlessly to multi-object systems of varying sizes and topologies. Leveraging the linearity of Hilbert spaces, GCE also supports simple yet effective control algorithms for synthesizing optimal sequences. Experiments on physical systems, robotics, and power grids validate GCE and demonstrate consistent performance improvement over various competitive embedding methods in both in-distribution and few-shot tests

Title: Command-filter-based trajectory-tracking control of quadrotor subject to internal and external disturbances
Authors: Mustafa Mohammed Mustafa
Abstract: We propose a command-filter backstepping controller that integrates a disturbance observer and a high-gain observer (HGO) to handle unknown internal and external disturbances acting on a quadrotor. To build the controller, we first define tracking errors between the measured and desired quadrotor outputs, which allow the system to be rewritten in a new set of state variables. Using this transformed model, we apply Lyapunov theory to derive a backstepping control law. To avoid repeated differentiation of states and virtual controls, a first-order command filter is introduced, and a nonlinear disturbance observer is added to provide disturbance estimates. Each state in the controller and observer is replaced with its estimate from the HGO. The resulting control law enables the quadrotor to follow its path despite internal and external disturbances, with each subsystem allowed its own disturbance type for realism. A new state transformation and Lyapunov-based derivation prevent the usual explosion of complexity, while the HGO reconstructs unmeasured states and their rates for output feedback. The nonlinear disturbance observer attenuates constant and nonlinear disturbances as well as band-limited white noise. The method reduces dependence on high-precision sensors and mitigates wind, model error, and rotor noise effects during flight. Unlike previous studies that treat either disturbance rejection or partial sensing, this work combines the command filter, disturbance observer, and HGO to address both challenges simultaneously while avoiding the complexity growth typical of backstepping designs.

Title: SPG-CDENet: Spatial Prior-Guided Cross Dual Encoder Network for Multi-Organ Segmentation
Authors: Xizhi Tian, Changjun Zhou, Yulin. Yang
Abstract: Multi-organ segmentation is a critical task in computer-aided diagnosis. While recent deep learning methods have achieved remarkable success in image segmentation, huge variations in organ size and shape challenge their effectiveness in multi-organ segmentation. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatial Prior-Guided Cross Dual Encoder Network (SPG-CDENet), a novel two-stage segmentation paradigm designed to improve multi-organ segmentation accuracy. Our SPG-CDENet consists of two key components: a spatial prior network and a cross dual encoder network. The prior network generates coarse localization maps that delineate the approximate ROI, serving as spatial guidance for the dual encoder network. The cross dual encoder network comprises four essential components: a global encoder, a local encoder, a symmetric cross-attention module, and a flow-based decoder. The global encoder captures global semantic features from the entire image, while the local encoder focuses on features from the prior network. To enhance the interaction between the global and local encoders, a symmetric cross-attention module is proposed across all layers of the encoders to fuse and refine features. Furthermore, the flow-based decoder directly propagates high-level semantic features from the final encoder layer to all decoder layers, maximizing feature preservation and utilization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SPG-CDENet compared to existing segmentation methods. Furthermore, ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed modules in improving segmentation accuracy.

Authors: Juanjo Zulaika, Ibone Oleaga, Anne Sanz, Naia Presno, Aitor Landa-Arrue, Miguel Bar√≥n, Mar√≠a del Puy Carretero, Unai Lopez-Novoa
Abstract: The manufacturing sector is moving from rigid, hardware-dependent systems toward flexible, software-driven environments. This transformation is shaped by the convergence of several Software-Defined technologies: Software-Defined Automation virtualizes industrial control, replacing proprietary PLCs with containerized, programmable solutions that enable scalability and interoperability. Software-Defined Compute and Communications provide a means to distribute intelligence seamlessly across devices, networks, and cloud platforms, reducing latency and enabling dynamic reconfiguration. Software-Defined Manufacturing Systems, usually implemented as Digital Twins, are real-time virtual models of machines and processes, allowing predictive analysis, optimization, and closer integration between human operators and intelligent systems. This work presents XWAVE, a project that unites these three Software-Defined paradigms to present a modular, fully software-defined manufacturing system.

Title: Safety Margins of Inverse Optimal ISSf Controllers
Authors: Ziliang Lyu, Yiguang Hong, Lihua Xie, Miroslav Krstic
Abstract: We investigate the gain margin of a general nonlinear system under an inverse optimal input-to-state safe (ISSf) controller of the form u=u0(x)+u*(x,u0), where u0 is the nominal control and u* is the inverse optimal safety filter that minimally modifies the nominal controller's unsafe actions over the infinite horizon. By first establishing a converse ISSf-BF theorem, we reveal the equivalence among the achievability of ISSf by feedback, the achievability of inverse optimality, and the solvability of a Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation associated with the inverse optimal ISSf gain assignment. Then we develop a collection of safety margin results on the overall control u=u0+u*. In the absence of disturbances, we find that standard inverse optimal safe controllers have a certain degree of gain margin. Specifically, when f(x) acts safely but u0 acts unsafely, the gain can be decreased by up to half; and when f(x) acts unsafely, we establish that, if u0 acts safely, the gain can be increased arbitrarily, whereas if u0 acts unsafely, the control recovers the full gain margin [1/2,inf). It is shown, however, that under control gain variation, the safe set of these controllers is locally asymptotically stable, which implies that their safety is sensitive to large but bounded disturbances. To make inverse optimal ISSf controllers robust to gain variation, we propose a gain margin improvement approach at the expense of an increased control effort. This improvement allows the inverse optimal safe control to inherit the standard gain margin of [1/2,inf) without requiring prior knowledge of whether f(x) or u0 acts safely on the safety boundary, while simultaneously ensuring global asymptotic stability of the resulting safe set. In the presence of disturbances, this improvement idea renders inverse optimal ISSf controllers robust to gain variations with the same gain margin of [1/2,inf).

Title: Efficient Collision-Avoidance Constraints for Ellipsoidal Obstacles in Optimal Control: Application to Path-Following MPC and UAVs
Authors: David Leprich, Mario Rosenfelder, Markus Herrmann-Wicklmayr, Kathrin Fla√ükamp, Peter Eberhard, Henrik Ebel
Abstract: This article proposes a modular optimal control framework for local three-dimensional ellipsoidal obstacle avoidance, exemplarily applied to model predictive path-following control. Static as well as moving obstacles are considered. Central to the approach is a computationally efficient and continuously differentiable condition for detecting collisions with ellipsoidal obstacles. A novel two-stage optimization approach mitigates numerical issues arising from the structure of the resulting optimal control problem. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through simulations and real-world experiments with the Crazyflie quadrotor. This represents the first hardware demonstration of an MPC controller of this kind for UAVs in a three-dimensional task.

Title: HMM for short independent sequences: Multiple sequence Baum-Welch application
Authors: Margarita Cabrera-Bean, Josep Vidal, Sergio Fernandez-Bertolin, Albert Roso-Llorach, Concepcion Violan
Abstract: In the classical setting, the training of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) typically relies on a single, sufficiently long observation sequence that can be regarded as representative of the underlying stochastic process. In this context, the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is applied in its specialized form for HMMs, namely the Baum Welch algorithm, which has been extensively employed in applications such as speech recognition. The objective of this work is to present pseudocode formulations for both the training and decoding procedures of HMMs in a different scenario, where the available data consist of multiple independent temporal sequences generated by the same model, each of relatively short duration, i.e., containing only a limited number of samples. Special emphasis is placed on the relevance of this formulation to longitudinal studies in population health, where datasets are naturally structured as collections of short trajectories across individuals with point data at follow up.

Title: Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Models for Olive Tree Crown and Shadow Segmentation Towards Biovolume Estimation
Authors: Wondimagegn Abebe Demissie, Stefano Roccella, Rudy Rossetto, Antonio Minnocci, Andrea Vannini, Luca Sebastiani
Abstract: Olive tree biovolume estimation is a key task in precision agriculture, supporting yield prediction and resource management, especially in Mediterranean regions severely impacted by climate-induced stress. This study presents a comparative analysis of three deep learning models U-Net, YOLOv11m-seg, and Mask RCNN for segmenting olive tree crowns and their shadows in ultra-high resolution UAV imagery. The UAV dataset, acquired over Vicopisano, Italy, includes manually annotated crown and shadow masks. Building on these annotations, the methodology emphasizes spatial feature extraction and robust segmentation; per-tree biovolume is then estimated by combining crown projected area with shadow-derived height using solar geometry. In testing, Mask R-CNN achieved the best overall accuracy (F1 = 0.86; mIoU = 0.72), while YOLOv11m-seg provided the fastest throughput (0.12 second per image). The estimated biovolumes spanned from approximately 4 to 24 cubic meters, reflecting clear structural differences among trees. These results indicate Mask R-CNN is preferable when biovolume accuracy is paramount, whereas YOLOv11m-seg suits large-area deployments where speed is critical; U-Net remains a lightweight, high-sensitivity option. The framework enables accurate, scalable orchard monitoring and can be further strengthened with DEM or DSM integration and field calibration for operational decision support.

Title: Two-Timescale Optimization Framework for IAB-Enabled Heterogeneous UAV Networks
Authors: Jikang Deng, Hui Zhou, Mohamed-Slim Alouini
Abstract: In post-disaster scenarios, the rapid deployment of adequate communication infrastructure is essential to support disaster search, rescue, and recovery operations. To achieve this, uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) has emerged as a promising solution for emergency communication due to its low cost and deployment flexibility. However, conventional untethered UAV (U-UAV) is constrained by size, weight, and power (SWaP) limitations, making it incapable of maintaining the operation of a macro base station. To address this limitation, we propose a heterogeneous UAV-based framework that integrates tethered UAV (T-UAV) and U-UAVs, where U-UAVs are utilized to enhance the throughput of cell-edge ground user equipments (G-UEs) and guarantee seamless connectivity during G-UEs' mobility to safe zones. It is noted that the integrated access and backhaul (IAB) technique is adopted to support the wireless backhaul of U-UAVs. Accordingly, we formulate a two-timescale joint user scheduling and trajectory control optimization problem, aiming to maximize the downlink throughput under asymmetric traffic demands and G-UEs' mobility. To solve the formulated problem, we proposed a two-timescale multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (TTS-MADDPG) algorithm based on the centralized training and distributed execution paradigm. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other benchmarks, including the two-timescale multi-agent proximal policy optimization (TTS-MAPPO) algorithm and MADDPG scheduling method, with robust and higher throughput. Specifically, the proposed algorithm obtains up to 12.2\% average throughput gain compared to the MADDPG scheduling method.

Title: Optimal Bidding and Coordinated Dispatch of Hybrid Energy Systems in Regulation Markets
Authors: Tanmay Mishra, Dakota Hamilton, Mads R. Almassalkhi
Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources and distributed energy resources (DER) into modern power systems introduces significant uncertainty, posing challenges for maintaining grid flexibility and reliability. Hybrid energy systems (HES), composed of controllable generators, flexible loads, and battery storage, offer a decentralized solution to enhance flexibility compared to single centralized resources. This paper presents a two-level framework to enable HES participation in frequency regulation markets. The upper level performs a chance-constrained optimization to choose capacity bids based on historical regulation signals. At the lower level, a real-time control strategy disaggregates the regulation power among the constituent resources. This real-time control strategy is then benchmarked against an offline optimal dispatch to evaluate flexibility performance. Additionally, the framework evaluates the profitability of overbidding strategies and identifies thresholds beyond which performance degradation may lead to market penalties or disqualification. The proposed framework also compare the impact of imbalance of power capacities on performance and battery state of charge (SoC) through asymmetric HES configurations.

Title: Statistically Adaptive Differential Protection for AC Microgrids Based on Kullback-Leibler Divergence
Authors: Shahab Moradi Torkashvand, Arina Kharazi, Emad Sadeghi, Seyed Hossein Hesamedin Sadeghi, Adel Nasiri
Abstract: The proliferation of inverter-based resources challenges traditional microgrid protection by introducing variable fault currents and complex transients. This paper presents a statistically adaptive differential protection scheme based on Kullback-Leibler divergence, implemented via a Bartlett-corrected G-statistic computed on logarithm-transformed current magnitudes. The method is a multivariate fault detection engine that employs the Mahalanobis distance to distinguish healthy and faulty states, enabling robust detection even in noisy environments. Detection thresholds are statistically derived from a chi-squared distribution for precise control over the false alarm rate. Upon detection, a lightweight classifier identifies the fault type by assessing per-phase G-statistics against dedicated thresholds, enhanced by a temporal persistence filter for security. Extensive simulations on a modified CIGRE 14-bus microgrid show high efficacy: sub-cycle average detection delays, high detection and classification accuracy across operating modes, resilience to high-impedance faults up to 250 Ohms, tolerance to 10 ms communication delay, and noise levels down to a 20 dB signal-to-noise ratio. These findings demonstrate a reproducible and computationally efficient solution for next-generation AC microgrid protection.

Abstract: Accurate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segmentation is crucial for clinical decision-making, but remains labor-intensive when performed manually. Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods can be accurate and efficient, but often generalize poorly to MRI's variable contrast, intensity inhomogeneity, and protocols. Although the transformer-based Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable generalizability in natural images, existing adaptations often treat MRI as another imaging modality, overlooking these modality-specific challenges. We present SAMRI, an MRI-specialized SAM trained and validated on 1.1 million labeled MR slices spanning whole-body organs and pathologies. We demonstrate that SAM can be effectively adapted to MRI by simply fine-tuning its mask decoder using a two-stage strategy, reducing training time by 94% and trainable parameters by 96% versus full-model retraining. Across diverse MRI segmentation tasks, SAMRI achieves a mean Dice of 0.87, delivering state-of-the-art accuracy across anatomical regions and robust generalization on unseen structures, particularly small and clinically important structures.

Title: BRIQA: Balanced Reweighting in Image Quality Assessment of Pediatric Brain MRI
Authors: Alya Almsouti, Ainur Khamitova, Darya Taratynova, Mohammad Yaqub
Abstract: Assessing the severity of artifacts in pediatric brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is critical for diagnostic accuracy, especially in low-field systems where the signal-to-noise ratio is reduced. Manual quality assessment is time-consuming and subjective, motivating the need for robust automated solutions. In this work, we propose BRIQA (Balanced Reweighting in Image Quality Assessment), which addresses class imbalance in artifact severity levels. BRIQA uses gradient-based loss reweighting to dynamically adjust per-class contributions and employs a rotating batching scheme to ensure consistent exposure to underrepresented classes. Through experiments, no single architecture performs best across all artifact types, emphasizing the importance of architectural diversity. The rotating batching configuration improves performance across metrics by promoting balanced learning when combined with cross-entropy loss. BRIQA improves average macro F1 score from 0.659 to 0.706, with notable gains in Noise (0.430), Zipper (0.098), Positioning (0.097), Contrast (0.217), Motion (0.022), and Banding (0.012) artifact severity classification. The code is available at this https URL.

Title: Graph approach for observability analysis in power system dynamic state estimation
Authors: Akhila Kandivalasa, Marcos Netto
Abstract: The proposed approach yields a numerical method that provably executes in linear time with respect to the number of nodes and edges in a graph. The graph, constructed from the power system model, requires only knowledge of the dependencies between state-to-state and output-to-state variables within a state-space framework. While graph-based observability analysis methods exist for power system static-state estimation, the approach presented here is the first for dynamic-state estimation (DSE). We examine decentralized and centralized DSE scenarios and compare our findings with a well-established, albeit non-scalable, observability analysis method in the literature. When compared to the latter in a centralized DSE setting, our method reduced computation time by 1440x.

Title: ProstNFound+: A Prospective Study using Medical Foundation Models for Prostate Cancer Detection
Authors: Paul F. R. Wilson, Mohamed Harmanani, Minh Nguyen Nhat To, Amoon Jamzad, Tarek Elghareb, Zhuoxin Guo, Adam Kinnaird, Brian Wodlinger, Purang Abolmaesumi, Parvin Mousavi
Abstract: Purpose: Medical foundation models (FMs) offer a path to build high-performance diagnostic systems. However, their application to prostate cancer (PCa) detection from micro-ultrasound ({\mu}US) remains untested in clinical settings. We present ProstNFound+, an adaptation of FMs for PCa detection from {\mu}US, along with its first prospective validation. Methods: ProstNFound+ incorporates a medical FM, adapter tuning, and a custom prompt encoder that embeds PCa-specific clinical biomarkers. The model generates a cancer heatmap and a risk score for clinically significant PCa. Following training on multi-center retrospective data, the model is prospectively evaluated on data acquired five years later from a new clinical site. Model predictions are benchmarked against standard clinical scoring protocols (PRI-MUS and PI-RADS). Results: ProstNFound+ shows strong generalization to the prospective data, with no performance degradation compared to retrospective evaluation. It aligns closely with clinical scores and produces interpretable heatmaps consistent with biopsy-confirmed lesions. Conclusion: The results highlight its potential for clinical deployment, offering a scalable and interpretable alternative to expert-driven protocols.

Title: Pareto-Optimal Sampling and Resource Allocation for Timely Communication in Shared-Spectrum Low-Altitude Networks
Authors: Bowen Li, Jiping Luo, Themistoklis Charalambous, Nikolaos Pappas
Abstract: Guaranteeing stringent data freshness for low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in shared spectrum forces a critical trade-off between two operational costs: the UAV's own energy consumption and the occupation of terrestrial channel resources. The core challenge is to satisfy the aerial data freshness while finding a Pareto-optimal balance between these costs. Leveraging predictive channel models and predictive UAV trajectories, we formulate a bi-objective Pareto optimization problem over a long-term planning horizon to jointly optimize the sampling timing for aerial traffic and the power and spectrum allocation for fair coexistence. However, the problem's non-convex, mixed-integer nature renders classical methods incapable of fully characterizing the complete Pareto frontier. Notably, we show monotonicity properties of the frontier, building on which we transform the bi-objective problem into several single-objective problems. We then propose a new graph-based algorithm and prove that it can find the complete set of Pareto optima with low complexity, linear in the horizon and near-quadratic in the resource block (RB) budget. Numerical comparisons show that our approach meets the stringent timeliness requirement and achieves a six-fold reduction in RB utilization or a 6 dB energy saving compared to benchmarks.

Title: Time-Optimal Model Predictive Control for Linear Systems with Multiplicative Uncertainties
Authors: Renato Quartullo, Andrea Garulli, Mirko Leomanni
Abstract: This paper presents a time-optimal Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme for linear discrete-time systems subject to multiplicative uncertainties represented by interval matrices. To render the uncertainty propagation computationally tractable, the set-valued error system dynamics are approximated using a matrix-zonotope-based bounding operator. Recursive feasibility and finite-time convergence are ensured through an adaptive terminal constraint mechanism. A key advantage of the proposed approach is that all the necessary bounding sets can be computed offline, substantially reducing the online computational burden. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated via a numerical case study on an orbital rendezvous maneuver between two satellites.

Title: Graph Guided Modulo Recovery of EEG Signals
Authors: Soujanya Hazra, Sanjay Ghosh
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) often shows significant variability among people. This fluctuation disrupts reliable acquisition and may result in distortion or clipping. Modulo sampling is now a promising solution to this problem, by folding signals instead of saturating them. Recovery of the original waveform from folded observations is a highly ill-posed problem. In this work, we propose a method based on a graph neural network, referred to as GraphUnwrapNet, for the modulo recovery of EEG signals. Our core idea is to represent an EEG signal as an organized graph whose channels and temporal connections establish underlying interdependence. One of our key contributions is in introducing a pre-estimation guided feature injection module to provide coarse folding indicators that enhance stability during recovery at wrap boundaries. This design integrates structural information with folding priors into an integrated framework. We performed comprehensive experiments on the Simultaneous Task EEG Workload (STEW) dataset. The results demonstrate consistent enhancements over traditional optimization techniques and competitive accuracy relative to current deep learning models. Our findings emphasize the potential of graph-based methodology for robust modulo EEG recovery.

Title: MORE: Multi-Organ Medical Image REconstruction Dataset
Authors: Shaokai Wu, Yapan Guo, Yanbiao Ji, Jing Tong, Yuxiang Lu, Mei Li, Suizhi Huang, Yue Ding, Hongtao Lu
Abstract: CT reconstruction provides radiologists with images for diagnosis and treatment, yet current deep learning methods are typically limited to specific anatomies and datasets, hindering generalization ability to unseen anatomies and lesions. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Organ medical image REconstruction (MORE) dataset, comprising CT scans across 9 diverse anatomies with 15 lesion types. This dataset serves two key purposes: (1) enabling robust training of deep learning models on extensive, heterogeneous data, and (2) facilitating rigorous evaluation of model generalization for CT reconstruction. We further establish a strong baseline solution that outperforms prior approaches under these challenging conditions. Our results demonstrate that: (1) a comprehensive dataset helps improve the generalization capability of models, and (2) optimization-based methods offer enhanced robustness for unseen anatomies. The MORE dataset is freely accessible under CC-BY-NC 4.0 at our project page this https URL

Title: POWSM: A Phonetic Open Whisper-Style Speech Foundation Model
Authors: Chin-Jou Li, Kalvin Chang, Shikhar Bharadwaj, Eunjung Yeo, Kwanghee Choi, Jian Zhu, David Mortensen, Shinji Watanabe
Abstract: Recent advances in spoken language processing have led to substantial progress in phonetic tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), phone recognition (PR), grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (G2P), and phoneme-to-grapheme conversion (P2G). Despite their conceptual similarity, these tasks have largely been studied in isolation, each relying on task-specific architectures and datasets. In this paper, we introduce POWSM (Phonetic Open Whisper-style Speech Model), the first unified framework capable of jointly performing multiple phone-related tasks. POWSM enables seamless conversion between audio, text (graphemes), and phones, opening up new possibilities for universal and low-resource speech processing. Our model outperforms or matches specialized PR models of similar size (Wav2Vec2Phoneme and ZIPA) while jointly supporting G2P, P2G, and ASR. Our training data, code and models are released to foster open science.

Title: HiMAE: Hierarchical Masked Autoencoders Discover Resolution-Specific Structure in Wearable Time Series

Abstract: Wearable sensors provide abundant physiological time series, yet the principles governing their predictive utility remain unclear. We hypothesize that temporal resolution is a fundamental axis of representation learning, with different clinical and behavioral outcomes relying on structure at distinct scales. To test this resolution hypothesis, we introduce HiMAE (Hierarchical Masked Autoencoder), a self supervised framework that combines masked autoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder decoder. HiMAE produces multi resolution embeddings that enable systematic evaluation of which temporal scales carry predictive signal, transforming resolution from a hyperparameter into a probe for interpretability. Across classification, regression, and generative benchmarks, HiMAE consistently outperforms state of the art foundation models that collapse scale, while being orders of magnitude smaller. HiMAE is an efficient representation learner compact enough to run entirely on watch, achieving sub millisecond inference on smartwatch class CPUs for true edge inference. Together, these contributions position HiMAE as both an efficient self supervised learning method and a discovery tool for scale sensitive structure in wearable health.

Title: Risk-Aware Safety Filters with Poisson Safety Functions and Laplace Guidance Fields
Authors: Gilbert Bahati, Ryan M. Bena, Meg Wilkinson, Pol Mestres, Ryan K. Cosner, Aaron D. Ames
Abstract: Robotic systems navigating in real-world settings require a semantic understanding of their environment to properly determine safe actions. This work aims to develop the mathematical underpinnings of such a representation--specifically, the goal is to develop safety filters that are risk-aware. To this end, we take a two step approach: encoding an understanding of the environment via Poisson's equation, and associated risk via Laplace guidance fields. That is, we first solve a Dirichlet problem for Poisson's equation to generate a safety function that encodes system safety as its 0-superlevel set. We then separately solve a Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation to synthesize a safe \textit{guidance field} that encodes variable levels of caution around obstacles -- by enforcing a tunable flux boundary condition. The safety function and guidance fields are then combined to define a safety constraint and used to synthesize a risk-aware safety filter which, given a semantic understanding of an environment with associated risk levels of environmental features, guarantees safety while prioritizing avoidance of higher risk obstacles. We demonstrate this method in simulation and discuss how \textit{a priori} understandings of obstacle risk can be directly incorporated into the safety filter to generate safe behaviors that are risk-aware.

Title: Coherence-Aware Distributed Learning under Heterogeneous Downlink Impairments
Authors: Mehdi Karbalayghareh, David J. Love, Christopher G. Brinton
Abstract: The performance of federated learning (FL) over wireless networks critically depends on accurate and timely channel state information (CSI) across distributed devices. This requirement is tightly linked to how rapidly the channel gains vary, i.e., the coherence intervals. In practice, edge devices often exhibit unequal coherence times due to differences in mobility and scattering environments, leading to unequal demands for pilot signaling and channel estimation resources. Conventional FL schemes that overlook this coherence disparity can suffer from severe communication inefficiencies and training overhead. This paper proposes a coherence-aware, communication-efficient framework for joint channel training and model updating in practical wireless FL systems operating under heterogeneous fading dynamics. Focusing on downlink impairments, we introduce a resource-reuse strategy based on product superposition, enabling the parameter server to efficiently schedule both static and dynamic devices by embedding global model updates for static devices within pilot transmissions intended for mobile devices. We theoretically analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed scheme and quantify its gains in expected communication efficiency and training accuracy. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework under mobility-induced dynamics and offer useful insights for the practical deployment of FL over wireless channels.

Title: A New Type of Axis-Angle Attitude Control Law for Rotational Systems: Synthesis, Analysis, and Experiments
Authors: Francisco M. F. R. Gon√ßalves, Ryan M. Bena, N√©stor O. P√©rez-Arancibia
Abstract: Over the past few decades, continuous quaternion-based attitude control has been proven highly effective for driving rotational systems that can be modeled as rigid bodies, such as satellites and drones. However, methods rooted in this approach do not enforce the existence of a unique closed-loop (CL) equilibrium attitude-error quaternion (AEQ); and, for rotational errors about the attitude-error Euler axis larger than {\pi}rad, their proportional-control effect diminishes as the system state moves away from the stable equilibrium of the CL rotational dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a new type of attitude control law that more effectively leverages the attitude-error Euler axis-angle information to guarantee a unique CL equilibrium AEQ and to provide greater flexibility in the use of proportional-control efforts. Furthermore, using two different control laws as examples-through the construction of a strict Lyapunov function for the CL dynamics-we demonstrate that the resulting unique equilibrium of the CL rotational system can be enforced to be uniformly asymptotically stable. To assess and demonstrate the functionality and performance of the proposed approach, we performed numerical simulations and executed dozens of real-time tumble-recovery maneuvers using a small quadrotor. These simulations and flight tests compellingly demonstrate that the proposed axis-angle-based method achieves superior flight performance-compared with that obtained using a high-performance quaternion-based controller-in terms of stabilization time.

Title: A Parallelized Cutting-Plane Algorithm for Computationally Efficient Modelling to Generate Alternatives
Authors: Michael Lau, Filippo Pecci, Jesse D. Jenkins
Abstract: Contemporary macro energy systems modelling is characterized by the need to represent strategic and operational decisions with high temporal and spatial resolution and represent discrete investment and retirement decisions. This drive towards greater fidelity, however, conflicts with a simultaneous push towards greater model representation of inherent complexity in decision making, including methods like Modelling to Generate Alternatives (MGA). MGA aims to map the feasible space of a model within a cost slack by varying investment parameters without changing the operational constraints, a process which frequently requires hundreds of solutions. For large, detailed energy system models this is impossible with traditional methods, leading researchers to reduce complexity with linearized investments and zonal or temporal aggregation. This research presents a new solution method for MGA type problems using cutting-plane methods based on a tailored reformulation of Benders Decomposition. We accelerate the algorithm by sharing cuts between MGA master problems and grouping MGA objectives. We find that our new solution method consistently solves MGA problems times faster and requires less memory than existing monolithic Modelling to Generate Alternatives solution methods on linear problems, enabling rapid computation of a greater number of solutions to highly resolved models. We also show that our novel cutting-plane algorithm enables the solution of very large MGA problems with integer investment decisions.

Title: Duality-Based Fixed Point Iteration Algorithm for Beamforming Design in ISAC Systems
Authors: Xilai Fan, Ya-Feng Liu
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the beamforming design problem in an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where a multi-antenna base station simultaneously serves multiple communication users while performing radar sensing. We formulate the problem as the minimization of the total transmit power, subject to signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints for communication users and mean-squared-error (MSE) constraints for radar sensing. The core challenge arises from the complex coupling between communication SINR requirements and sensing performance metrics. To efficiently address this challenge, we first establish the equivalence between the original ISAC beamforming problem and its semidefinite relaxation (SDR), derive its Lagrangian dual formulation, and further reformulate it as a generalized downlink beamforming (GDB) problem with potentially indefinite weighting matrices. Compared to the classical DB problem, the presence of indefinite weighting matrices in the GDB problem introduces substantial analytical and computational challenges. Our key technical contributions include (i) a necessary and sufficient condition for the boundedness of the GDB problem, and (ii) a tailored efficient fixed point iteration (FPI) algorithm with a provable convergence guarantee for solving the GDB problem. Building upon these results, we develop a duality-based fixed point iteration (Dual-FPI) algorithm, which integrates an outer subgradient ascent loop with an inner FPI loop. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed Dual-FPI algorithm achieves globally optimal solutions while significantly reducing computational complexity compared with existing baseline approaches.

Title: Confidential FRIT via Homomorphic Encryption
Authors: Haruki Hoshino, Jungjin Park, Osamu Kaneko, Kiminao Kogiso
Abstract: Edge computing alleviates the computation burden of data-driven control in cyber-physical systems (CPSs) by offloading complex processing to edge servers. However, the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks underscores the need for security measures that go beyond conventional IT protections and address the unique vulnerabilities of CPSs. This study proposes a confidential data-driven gain-tuning framework using homomorphic encryption, such as ElGamal and CKKS encryption schemes, to enhance cybersecurity in gain-tuning processes outsourced to external servers. The idea for realizing confidential FRIT is to replace the matrix inversion operation with a vector summation form, allowing homomorphic operations to be applied. Numerical examples under 128-bit security confirm performance comparable to conventional methods while providing guidelines for selecting suitable encryption schemes for secure CPS.

Title: SP-MCQA: Evaluating Intelligibility of TTS Beyond the Word Level
Authors: Hitomi Jin Ling Tee, Chaoren Wang, Zijie Zhang, Zhizheng Wu
Abstract: The evaluation of intelligibility for TTS has reached a bottleneck, as existing assessments heavily rely on word-by-word accuracy metrics such as WER, which fail to capture the complexity of real-world speech or reflect human comprehension needs. To address this, we propose Spoken-Passage Multiple-Choice Question Answering, a novel subjective approach evaluating the accuracy of key information in synthesized speech, and release SP-MCQA-Eval, an 8.76-hour news-style benchmark dataset for SP-MCQA evaluation. Our experiments reveal that low WER does not necessarily guarantee high key-information accuracy, exposing a gap between traditional metrics and practical intelligibility. SP-MCQA shows that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models still lack robust text normalization and phonetic accuracy. This work underscores the urgent need for high-level, more life-like evaluation criteria now that many systems already excel at WER yet may fall short on real-world intelligibility.

Title: Efficient Spectral Efficiency Maximization Design for IRS-aided MIMO Systems
Authors: Fuying Li, Yajun Wang, Zhuxian Lian, Wen Chen
Abstract: Driven by the growing demand for higher spectral efficiency in wireless communications, intelligent reflecting sur- faces (IRS) have attracted considerable attention for their ability to dynamically reconfigure the propagation environment. This work addresses the spectral efficiency maximization problem in IRS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which involves the joint optimization of the transmit precoding matrix and the IRS phase shift configuration. This problem is inherently challenging due to its non-convex nature. To tackle it effectively, we introduce a computationally efficient algorithm, termed ADMM-APG, which integrates the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with the accelerated projected gradient (APG) method. The proposed framework decomposes the original problem into tractable subproblems, each admitting a closed-form solution while maintaining low computational com- plexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the ADMM-APG algorithm consistently surpasses existing benchmark methods in terms of spectral efficiency and computational complexity, achieving significant performance gains across a range of system configurations.

Title: Modeling strategies for speech enhancement in the latent space of a neural audio codec
Authors: Sofiene Kammoun, Xavier Alameda-Pineda, Simon Leglaive
Abstract: Neural audio codecs (NACs) provide compact latent speech representations in the form of sequences of continuous vectors or discrete tokens. In this work, we investigate how these two types of speech representations compare when used as training targets for supervised speech enhancement. We consider both autoregressive and non-autoregressive speech enhancement models based on the Conformer architecture, as well as a simple baseline where the NAC encoder is simply fine-tuned for speech enhancement. Our experiments reveal three key findings: predicting continuous latent representations consistently outperforms discrete token prediction; autoregressive models achieve higher quality but at the expense of intelligibility and efficiency, making non-autoregressive models more attractive in practice; and encoder fine-tuning yields the strongest enhancement metrics overall, though at the cost of degraded codec reconstruction. The code and audio samples are available online.

Title: Cooperative Task Spaces for Multi-Arm Manipulation Control based on Similarity Transformations
Authors: Tobias L√∂w, Cem Bilaloglu, Sylvain Calinon
Abstract: Many tasks in human environments require collaborative behavior between multiple kinematic chains, either to provide additional support for carrying big and bulky objects or to enable the dexterity that is required for in-hand manipulation. Since these complex systems often have a very high number of degrees of freedom coordinating their movements is notoriously difficult to model. In this article, we present the derivation of the theoretical foundations for cooperative task spaces of multi-arm robotic systems based on geometric primitives defined using conformal geometric algebra. Based on the similarity transformations of these cooperative geometric primitives, we derive an abstraction of complex robotic systems that enables representing these systems in a way that directly corresponds to single-arm systems. By deriving the associated analytic and geometric Jacobian matrices, we then show the straightforward integration of our approach into classical control techniques rooted in operational space control. We demonstrate this using bimanual manipulators, humanoids and multi-fingered hands in optimal control experiments for reaching desired geometric primitives and in teleoperation experiments using differential kinematics control. We then discuss how the geometric primitives naturally embed nullspace structures into the controllers that can be exploited for introducing secondary control objectives. This work, represents the theoretical foundations of this cooperative manipulation control framework, and thus the experiments are presented in an abstract way, while giving pointers towards potential future applications.

Title: Life-cycle Modeling and the Walking Behavior of the Pedestrian-Group as an Emergent Agent: With Empirical Data on the Cohesion of the Group Formation
Authors: Saleh Albeaik, Mohamad Alrished, Faisal Alsallum
Abstract: This article investigates the pedestrian group as an emergent agent. The article explores empirical data to derive emergent agency and formation state spaces and outline recurring patterns of walking behavior. In this analysis, pedestrian trajectories extracted from surveillance videos are used along with manually annotated pedestrian group memberships. We conducted manual expert evaluation of observed groups, produced new manual annotations for relevant events pertaining to group behavior and extracted metrics relevant group formation. This information along with quantitative analysis was used to model the life-cycle and formation of the group agent. Those models give structure to expectations around walking behavior of groups; from pedestrian walking independently to the emergence of a collective intention where group members tended to maintain bounded distance between each other. Disturbances to this bounded distance often happened in association with changes in either their agency or their formation states. We summarized the patterns of behavior along with the sequences of state transitions into abstract patterns, which can aid in the development of more detailed group agents in simulation and in the design of engineering systems to interact with such groups.

Title: Proxemics and Permeability of the Pedestrian Group
Authors: Saleh Albeaik, Faisal Alsallum, Mohamad Alrished
Abstract: People tend to walk in groups, and interactions with those groups have a significant impact on crowd behavior and pedestrian traffic dynamics. Social norms can be seen as unwritten rules regulating people interactions in social settings. This article studies people interactions with groups and the emergence of group proxemics. Group zones, zone occupancy counts and people clearance from the group are studied using naturalistic data. Analysis indicate potential presence of three different zones in addition to the public zone. People tend to remain in the public zone and only progressively get closer to groups, and those closer approaches happen in a low frequency and for brief periods of time.

Title: Agentic AI Home Energy Management System: A Large Language Model Framework for Residential Load Scheduling
Authors: Reda El Makroum, Sebastian Zwickl-Bernhard, Lukas Kranzl
Abstract: The electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in residential demand response capacity, yet Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of everyday preferences into technical parameters. While large language models have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter extractors, no existing implementation deploys LLMs as autonomous coordinators managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multi-appliance scheduling. This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device control, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations. A hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for context-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models using real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability differences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance but struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously. Progressive prompt engineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without explicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning capabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic, agent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension, and future research.

Title: CYPRESS: Crop Yield Prediction via Regression on Prithvi's Encoder for Satellite Sensing
Authors: Shayan Nejadshamsi, Yuanyuan Zhang, Shadi Zaki, Brock Porth, Lysa Porth, Vahab Khoshdel
Abstract: Accurate and timely crop yield prediction is crucial for global food security and modern agricultural management. Traditional methods often lack the scalability and granularity required for precision farming. This paper introduces CYPRESS (Crop Yield Prediction via Regression on Prithvi's Encoder for Satellite Sensing), a deep learning model designed for high-resolution, intra-field canola yield prediction. CYPRESS leverages a pre-trained, large-scale geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) and adapts it for a continuous regression task, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery into dense, pixel-level yield maps. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from the Canadian Prairies, CYPRESS demonstrates superior performance over existing deep learning-based yield prediction models, highlighting the effectiveness of fine-tuning foundation models for specialized agricultural applications. By providing a continuous, high-resolution output, CYPRESS offers a more actionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or county-level aggregation methods. This work validates a novel approach that bridges the gap between large-scale Earth observation and on-farm decision-making, offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural monitoring.

Title: Low-Altitude UAV-Carried Movable Antenna for Joint Wireless Power Transfer and Covert Communications
Authors: Chuang Zhang, Geng Sun, Jiahui Li, Jiacheng Wang, Qingqing Wu, Dusit Niyato, Shiwen Mao, Tony Q. S. Quek
Abstract: The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) networks has created an urgent need for sustainable energy solutions, particularly for the battery-constrained spatially distributed IoT nodes. While low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) employed with wireless power transfer (WPT) capabilities offer a promising solution, the line-of-sight channels that facilitate efficient energy delivery also expose sensitive operational data to adversaries. This paper proposes a novel low-altitude UAV-carried movable antenna-enhanced transmission system joint WPT and covert communications, which simultaneously performs energy supplements to IoT nodes and establishes transmission links with a covert user by leveraging wireless energy signals as a natural cover. Then, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that jointly maximizes the total harvested energy of IoT nodes and sum achievable rate of the covert user, while minimizing the propulsion energy consumption of the low-altitude UAV. To address the non-convex and temporally coupled optimization problem, we propose a mixture-of-experts-augmented soft actor-critic (MoE-SAC) algorithm that employs a sparse Top-K gated mixture-of-shallow-experts architecture to represent multimodal policy distributions arising from the conflicting optimization objectives. We also incorporate an action projection module that explicitly enforces per-time-slot power budget constraints and antenna position constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms some baseline approaches and other state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms.

Title: Non-Convex Over-the-Air Heterogeneous Federated Learning: A Bias-Variance Trade-off
Authors: Muhammad Faraz Ul Abrar, Nicol√≤ Michelusi
Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming \emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous} wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured, time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL baselines.

Title: Surpassing state of the art on AMD area estimation from RGB fundus images through careful selection of U-Net architectures and loss functions for class imbalance
Authors: Valentyna Starodub, Mantas Luko≈°eviƒçius
Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of irreversible vision impairment in people over the age of 60. This research focuses on semantic segmentation for AMD lesion detection in RGB fundus images, a non-invasive and cost-effective imaging technique. The results of the ADAM challenge - the most comprehensive AMD detection from RGB fundus images research competition and open dataset to date - serve as a benchmark for our evaluation. Taking the U-Net connectivity as a base of our framework, we evaluate and compare several approaches to improve the segmentation model's architecture and training pipeline, including pre-processing techniques, encoder (backbone) deep network types of varying complexity, and specialized loss functions to mitigate class imbalances on image and pixel levels. The main outcome of this research is the final configuration of the AMD detection framework, which outperforms all the prior ADAM challenge submissions on the multi-class segmentation of different AMD lesion types in non-invasive RGB fundus images. The source code used to conduct the experiments presented in this paper is made freely available.

Title: SafEDMD: A Koopman-based data-driven controller design framework for nonlinear dynamical systems
Authors: Robin Str√§sser, Manuel Schaller, Karl Worthmann, Julian Berberich, Frank Allg√∂wer
Abstract: The Koopman operator serves as the theoretical backbone for machine learning of dynamical control systems, where the operator is heuristically approximated by extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD). In this paper, we propose SafEDMD, a novel stability- and feedback-oriented EDMD-based controller design framework. Our approach leverages a reliable surrogate model generated in a data-driven fashion in order to provide closed-loop guarantees. In particular, we establish a controller design based on semi-definite programming with guaranteed stabilization of the underlying nonlinear system. As central ingredient, we derive proportional error bounds that vanish at the origin and are tailored to control tasks. We illustrate the developed method by means of several benchmark examples and highlight the advantages over state-of-the-art methods.

Title: High Performance Distributed Control for Large-Scale Linear Systems: A Cover-Based Distributed Observer Approach
Authors: Haotian Xu, Shuai Liu, Ling Shi
Abstract: In recent years, the distributed-observer-based distributed control law has shown powerful ability to arbitrarily approximate the centralized control performance. However, the traditional distributed observer requires each local observer to reconstruct the state information of the whole system, which is unrealistic for large-scale scenarios. To fill this gap, This paper presents a coverage solution algorithm for large-scale systems that accounts for both physical and communication network characteristics, which can significantly reduce the dimension of local observers. Then, the cover-based distributed observer for large-scale systems is proposed to overcome the problem that the system dynamics are difficult to estimate due to the coupling between cover sets. Furthermore, the two-layer Lyapunov analysis method is adopted and the dynamic transformation lemma of compact errors is proved, which solves the problem of analyzing stability of the error dynamic of the cover-based distributed observer. Finally, it is proved that the distributed control law based on the cover-based distributed observer can also arbitrarily approximate the control performance of the centralized control law, and the dimension of the local observer is greatly reduced compared with the traditional method. The simulation results show the validity of the developed theories.

Title: End-to-end guarantees for indirect data-driven control of bilinear systems with finite stochastic data
Authors: Nicolas Chatzikiriakos, Robin Str√§sser, Frank Allg√∂wer, Andrea Iannelli
Abstract: In this paper we propose an end-to-end algorithm for indirect data-driven control for bilinear systems with stability guarantees. We consider the case where the collected i.i.d. data is affected by probabilistic noise with possibly unbounded support and leverage tools from statistical learning theory to derive finite sample identification error bounds. To this end, we solve the bilinear identification problem by solving a set of linear and affine identification problems, by a particular choice of a control input during the data collection phase. We provide a priori as well as data-dependent finite sample identification error bounds on the individual matrices as well as ellipsoidal bounds, both of which are structurally suitable for control. Further, we integrate the structure of the derived identification error bounds in a robust controller design to obtain an exponentially stable closed-loop. By means of an extensive numerical study we showcase the interplay between the controller design and the derived identification error bounds. Moreover, we note appealing connections of our results to indirect data-driven control of general nonlinear systems through Koopman operator theory and discuss how our results may be applied in this setup.

Title: Sum-Rate Maximization for Pinching Antenna-assisted NOMA Systems with Multiple Dielectric Waveguides
Authors: Shaokang Hu, Ruotong Zhao, Yihuan Liao, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng, Jinhong Yuan
Abstract: This paper investigates the resource allocation design for a pinching antenna (PA)-assisted multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system featuring multiple dielectric waveguides. To enhance model accuracy, we propose a novel frequency-dependent power attenuation model for the dielectric waveguides in PA-assisted systems. By jointly optimizing the precoder vector and the PA placement, we aim to maximize the system's sum-rate while accounting for the power attenuation across the dielectric waveguides. The design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem. To effectively address the problem at hand, we introduce an alternating optimization-based algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution in polynomial time. Our results demonstrate that the proposed PA-assisted system not only significantly outperforms the conventional system but also surpasses a naive PA-assisted system that disregards power attenuation. The performance gain compared to the naive PA-assisted system becomes more pronounced at high carrier frequencies, emphasizing the importance of considering power attenuation in system design.

Title: Data-Efficient Excavation Force Estimation for Wheel Loaders
Authors: Armin Abdolmohammadi, Navid Mojahed, Shima Nazari, Bahram Ravani
Abstract: Accurate prediction of excavation forces is critical for enabling autonomous operation and optimizing control strategies in earthmoving machinery. Conventional approaches often depend on extensive data collection or computationally expensive simulations across multiple soil types, which limits their scalability and adaptability. This study presents a data-efficient framework that calibrates soil parameters using force measurements from the preceding bucket-loading cycle. The proposed method is based on an analytical soil-tool interaction model formulated through the fundamental earthmoving equation, and employs a multi-stage optimization procedure during the loading phase to identify relevant soil parameters. These estimated parameters are then used to predict excavation forces in the subsequent cycle, allowing the system to adapt its control inputs without relying on large-scale datasets or machine learning model training. The framework is validated through high-fidelity simulations in the Algoryx Dynamics engine under different soil types and excavation trajectories, achieving root-mean-square prediction errors between 10% and 15%. This cycle-to-cycle adaptation demonstrates strong potential for scalable, online force estimation and efficient path planning in wheel loader operations.

Title: Convex computation of regions of attraction from data using Sums-of-Squares programming
Authors: Oumayma Khattabi, Matteo Tacchi, Sorin Olaru
Abstract: The paper concentrates on the analysis of the Region of Attraction (RoA) for unknown autonomous dynamical systems. The aim is to explore a data-driven approach based on moment Sum-of-Squares (SoS) hierarchy, which enables novel RoA outer approximations despite the reduced information on the structure of the dynamics. The main contribution of this work is bypassing the system model and, consequently, the recurring constraint on its polynomial structure. Numerical experimentation showcases the influence of data on learned approximating sets, offering a promising outlook on the potential of this method.

Title: Recursive Experiment Design for Closed-Loop Identification with Output Perturbation Limits
Authors: Jingwei Hu, Dave Zachariah, Torbj√∂rn Wigren, Petre Stoica
Abstract: In many applications, system identification experiments must be performed under output feedback to ensure safety or to maintain system operation. In this paper, we consider the online design of informative experiments for ARMAX models by applying a bounded perturbation to the input signal generated by a fixed output feedback controller. Specifically, the design constrains the resulting output perturbation within user-specified limits and can be efficiently computed in closed form. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in a numerical experiment.

Title: FASL-Seg: Anatomy and Tool Segmentation of Surgical Scenes
Authors: Muraam Abdel-Ghani, Mahmoud Ali, Mohamed Ali, Fatmaelzahraa Ahmed, Muhammad Arsalan, Abdulaziz Al-Ali, Shidin Balakrishnan
Abstract: The growing popularity of robotic minimally invasive surgeries has made deep learning-based surgical training a key area of research. A thorough understanding of the surgical scene components is crucial, which semantic segmentation models can help achieve. However, most existing work focuses on surgical tools and overlooks anatomical objects. Additionally, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models struggle to balance capturing high-level contextual features and low-level edge features. We propose a Feature-Adaptive Spatial Localization model (FASL-Seg), designed to capture features at multiple levels of detail through two distinct processing streams, namely a Low-Level Feature Projection (LLFP) and a High-Level Feature Projection (HLFP) stream, for varying feature resolutions - enabling precise segmentation of anatomy and surgical instruments. We evaluated FASL-Seg on surgical segmentation benchmark datasets EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 on three use cases. The FASL-Seg model achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 72.71% on parts and anatomy segmentation in EndoVis18, improving on SOTA by 5%. It further achieves a mIoU of 85.61% and 72.78% in EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 tool type segmentation, respectively, outperforming SOTA overall performance, with comparable per-class SOTA results in both datasets and consistent performance in various classes for anatomy and instruments, demonstrating the effectiveness of distinct processing streams for varying feature resolutions.

Title: Machine-learning competition to grade EEG background patterns in newborns with hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy
Authors: Fabio Magarelli, Geraldine B. Boylan, Saeed Montazeri, Feargal O'Sullivan, Dominic Lightbody, Minoo Ashoori, Tamara Skoric, John M. O'Toole
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has the potential to support and improve expert performance in monitoring the brain function of at-risk newborns. Developing accurate and reliable ML models depends on access to high-quality, annotated data, a resource in short supply. ML competitions address this need by providing researchers access to expertly annotated datasets, fostering shared learning through direct model comparisons, and leveraging the benefits of crowdsourcing diverse expertise. We compiled a retrospective dataset containing 353 hours of EEG from 102 individual newborns from a multi-centre study. The data was fully anonymised and divided into training, testing, and held-out validation datasets. EEGs were graded for the severity of abnormal background patterns. Next, we created a web-based competition platform and hosted a machine learning competition to develop ML models for classifying the severity of EEG background patterns in newborns. After the competition closed, the top 4 performing models were evaluated offline on a separate held-out validation dataset. Although a feature-based model ranked first on the testing dataset, deep learning models generalised better on the validation sets. All methods had a significant decline in validation performance compared to the testing performance. This highlights the challenges for model generalisation on unseen data, emphasising the need for held-out validation datasets in ML studies with neonatal EEG. The study underscores the importance of training ML models on large and diverse datasets to ensure robust generalisation. The competition's outcome demonstrates the potential for open-access data and collaborative ML development to foster a collaborative research environment and expedite the development of clinical decision-support tools for neonatal neuromonitoring.

Title: An Attention-Enhanced Œ¶-OTDR Event Recognition Framework for Edge-Based Distributed Acoustic Sensing
Authors: Xiyang Lan, Xin Li, Yinglei Teng
Abstract: Phase-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometry {\Phi}-OTDR has emerged as a promising sensing technology in Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructures, enabling large-scale distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) for real-time monitoring at the edge in smart cities, industrial pipelines, and critical infrastructures. However, accurately recognizing events from massive {\Phi}-OTDR data streams remains challenging, as existing deep learning methods either disrupt the inherent spatiotemporal structure of signals or incur prohibitive computational costs, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained edge computing scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel STFT-based Attention-Enhanced Convolutional Neural Network (STFT-AECNN), which represents multi-channel time-series data as stacked spectrograms to fully exploit their spatiotemporal characteristics while enabling efficient 2D CNN processing. A Spatial Efficient Attention Module (SEAM) is further introduced to adaptively emphasize the most informative channels, and a joint Cross-Entropy and Triplet loss is adopted to enhance the discriminability of the learned feature space. Extensive experiments on the public BJTU {\Phi}-OTDR dataset demonstrate that STFT-AECNN achieves a peak accuracy of 99.94% while maintaining high computational efficiency. These results highlight its potential for real-time, scalable, and robust event recognition in edge-based DAS systems, paving the way for reliable and intelligent IoT sensing applications.

Title: Holographic Transformers for Complex-Valued Signal Processing: Integrating Phase Interference into Self-Attention
Authors: Enhao Huang, Zhiyu Zhang, Tianxiang Xu, Chunshu Xia, Kaichun Hu, Yuchen Yang, Tongtong Pan, Dong Dong, Zhan Qin
Abstract: Complex-valued signals encode both amplitude and phase, yet most deep models treat attention as real-valued correlation, overlooking interference effects. We introduce the Holographic Transformer, a physics-inspired architecture that incorporates wave interference principles into self-attention. Holographic attention modulates interactions by relative phase and coherently superimposes values, ensuring consistency between amplitude and phase. A dual-headed decoder simultaneously reconstructs the input and predicts task outputs, preventing phase collapse when losses prioritize magnitude over phase. We demonstrate that holographic attention implements a discrete interference operator and maintains phase consistency under linear mixing. Experiments on PolSAR image classification and wireless channel prediction show strong performance, achieving high classification accuracy and F1 scores, low regression error, and increased robustness to phase perturbations. These results highlight that enforcing physical consistency in attention leads to generalizable improvements in complex-valued learning and provides a unified, physics-based framework for coherent signal modeling.

Title: Phoenix-VAD: Streaming Semantic Endpoint Detection for Full-Duplex Speech Interaction
Authors: Weijie Wu, Wenhao Guan, Kaidi Wang, Peijie Chen, Zhuanling Zha, Junbo Li, Jun Fang, Lin Li, Qingyang Hong
Abstract: Spoken dialogue models have significantly advanced intelligent human-computer interaction, yet they lack a plug-and-play full-duplex prediction module for semantic endpoint detection, hindering seamless audio interactions. In this paper, we introduce Phoenix-VAD, an LLM-based model that enables streaming semantic endpoint detection. Specifically, Phoenix-VAD leverages the semantic comprehension capability of the LLM and a sliding window training strategy to achieve reliable semantic endpoint detection while supporting streaming inference. Experiments on both semantically complete and incomplete speech scenarios indicate that Phoenix-VAD achieves excellent and competitive performance. Furthermore, this design enables the full-duplex prediction module to be optimized independently of the dialogue model, providing more reliable and flexible support for next-generation human-computer interaction.

Title: ReCon-GS: Continuum-Preserved Gaussian Streaming for Fast and Compact Reconstruction of Dynamic Scenes
Authors: Jiaye Fu, Qiankun Gao, Chengxiang Wen, Yanmin Wu, Siwei Ma, Jiaqi Zhang, Jian Zhang
Abstract: Online free-viewpoint video (FVV) reconstruction is challenged by slow per-frame optimization, inconsistent motion estimation, and unsustainable storage demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Reconfigurable Continuum Gaussian Stream, dubbed ReCon-GS, a novel storage-aware framework that enables high fidelity online dynamic scene reconstruction and real-time rendering. Specifically, we dynamically allocate multi-level Anchor Gaussians in a density-adaptive fashion to capture inter-frame geometric deformations, thereby decomposing scene motion into compact coarse-to-fine representations. Then, we design a dynamic hierarchy reconfiguration strategy that preserves localized motion expressiveness through on-demand anchor re-hierarchization, while ensuring temporal consistency through intra-hierarchical deformation inheritance that confines transformation priors to their respective hierarchy levels. Furthermore, we introduce a storage-aware optimization mechanism that flexibly adjusts the density of Anchor Gaussians at different hierarchy levels, enabling a controllable trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and memory usage. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, ReCon-GS improves training efficiency by approximately 15% and achieves superior FVV synthesis quality with enhanced robustness and stability. Moreover, at equivalent rendering quality, ReCon-GS slashes memory requirements by over 50% compared to leading state-of-the-art methods.

Title: GCVAMD: A Modified CausalVAE Model for Causal Age-related Macular Degeneration Risk Factor Detection and Prediction
Authors: Daeyoung Kim
Abstract: Age Related Macular Degeneration(AMD) has been one of the most leading causes of permanent vision impairment in ophthalmology. Though treatments, such as anti VEGF drugs or photodynamic therapies, were developed to slow down the degenerative process of AMD, there is still no specific cure to reverse vision loss caused by AMD. Thus, for AMD, detecting existence of risk factors of AMD or AMD itself within the patient retina in early stages is a crucial task to reduce the possibility of vision impairment. Apart from traditional approaches, deep learning based methods, especially attention mechanism based CNNs and GradCAM based XAI analysis on OCT scans, exhibited successful performance in distinguishing AMD retina from normal retinas, making it possible to use AI driven models to aid medical diagnosis and analysis by ophthalmologists regarding AMD. However, though having significant success, previous works mostly focused on prediction performance itself, not pathologies or underlying causal mechanisms of AMD, which can prohibit intervention analysis on specific factors or even lead to less reliable decisions. Thus, this paper introduces a novel causal AMD analysis model: GCVAMD, which incorporates a modified CausalVAE approach that can extract latent causal factors from only raw OCT images. By considering causality in AMD detection, GCVAMD enables causal inference such as treatment simulation or intervention analysis regarding major risk factors: drusen and neovascularization, while returning informative latent causal features that can enhance downstream tasks. Results show that through GCVAMD, drusen status and neovascularization status can be identified with AMD causal mechanisms in GCVAMD latent spaces, which can in turn be used for various tasks from AMD detection(classification) to intervention analysis.

Title: Beyond the Use-and-then-Forget (UatF) Bound: Fixed Point Algorithms for Statistical Max-Min Power Control
Authors: Renato Luis Garrido Cavalcante, Noor Ul Ain, Lorenzo Miretti, Slawomir Stanczak
Abstract: We introduce mathematical tools and fixed point algorithms for optimal statistical max-min power control in cellular and cell-less massive MIMO systems. Unlike previous studies that rely on the use-and-then-forget (UatF) lower bound on Shannon achievable (ergodic) rates, our proposed framework can deal with alternative bounds that explicitly consider perfect or imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the decoder. In doing so, we address limitations of UatF-based power control algorithms, which inherit the shortcomings of the UatF bound. For example, the UatF bound can be overly conservative: in extreme cases, under fully statistical (nonadaptive) beamforming in zero-mean channels, the UatF bound produces trivial (zero) rate bounds. It also lacks scale invariance: merely scaling the beamformers can change the bound drastically. In contrast, our framework is compatible with information-theoretic bounds that do not suffer from the above drawbacks. We illustrate the framework by solving a max-min power control problem considering a standard bound that exploits instantaneous CSI at the decoder.

Title: DiffRhythm 2: Efficient and High Fidelity Song Generation via Block Flow Matching
Authors: Yuepeng Jiang, Huakang Chen, Ziqian Ning, Jixun Yao, Zerui Han, Di Wu, Meng Meng, Jian Luan, Zhonghua Fu, Lei Xie
Abstract: Generating full-length, high-quality songs is challenging, as it requires maintaining long-term coherence both across text and music modalities and within the music modality itself. Existing non-autoregressive (NAR) frameworks, while capable of producing high-quality songs, often struggle with the alignment between lyrics and vocal. Concurrently, catering to diverse musical preferences necessitates reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, existing methods often rely on merging multiple models during multi-preference optimization, which results in significant performance degradation. To address these challenges, we introduce DiffRhythm 2, an end-to-end framework designed for high-fidelity, controllable song generation. To tackle the lyric alignment problem, DiffRhythm 2 employs a semi-autoregressive architecture based on block flow matching. This design enables faithful alignment of lyrics to singing vocals without relying on external labels and constraints, all while preserving the high generation quality and efficiency of NAR models. To make this framework computationally tractable for long sequences, we implement a music variational autoencoder (VAE) that achieves a low frame rate of 5 Hz while still enabling high-fidelity audio reconstruction. In addition, to overcome the limitations of multi-preference optimization in RLHF, we propose cross-pair preference optimization. This method effectively mitigates the performance drop typically associated with model merging, allowing for more robust optimization across diverse human preferences. We further enhance musicality and structural coherence by introducing stochastic block representation alignment loss.

Title: Decentralized Merging Control of Connected and Automated Vehicles to Enhance Safety and Energy Efficiency using Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Shreshta Rajakumar Deshpande, Mrdjan Jankovic
Abstract: This paper presents a decentralized Control Barrier Function (CBF) based approach for highway merging of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs). In this control algorithm, each "host" vehicle negotiates with other agents in a control zone of the highway network, and enacts its own action, to perform safe and energy-efficient merge maneuvers. It uses predictor-corrector loops within the robust CBF setting for negotiation and to reconcile disagreements that may arise. There is no explicit order of vehicles and no priority. A notable feature is absence of gridlocks due to instability of the inter-agent system. Results from Monte Carlo simulations show significant improvement in the system-wide energy efficiency and traffic flow compared to a first-in-first-out approach, as well as enhanced robustness of the proposed decentralized controller compared to its centralized counterpart.

Title: Optimal and Heuristic Approaches for Platooning Systems with Deadlines
Authors: Thiago S. Gomides, Evangelos Kranakis, Ioannis Lambadaris, Yannis Viniotis, Gennady Shaikhet
Abstract: Efficient truck platooning is a key strategy for reducing freight costs, lowering fuel consumption, and mitigating emissions. Deadlines are critical in this context, as trucks must depart within specific time windows to meet delivery requirements and avoid penalties. In this paper, we investigate the optimal formation and dispatch of truck platoons at a highway station with finite capacity $L$ and deadline constraints $T$. The system operates in discrete time, with each arriving truck assigned a deadline of $T$ slot units. The objective is to leverage the efficiency gains from forming large platoons while accounting for waiting costs and deadline violations. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and analyze the structure of the optimal policy $\pi^\star$ for $L = 3$, extending insights to arbitrary $L$. We prove certain monotonicity properties of the optimal policy in the state space $\mathcal{S}$ and identify classes of unreachable states. Moreover, since the size of $\mathcal{S}$ grows exponentially with $L$ and $T$, we propose heuristics -- including conditional and deep-learning based approaches -- that exploit these structural insights while maintaining low computational complexity.

Title: Time Weaver: A Conditional Time Series Generation Model
Authors: Sai Shankar Narasimhan, Shubhankar Agarwal, Oguzhan Akcin, Sujay Sanghavi, Sandeep Chinchali
Abstract: Imagine generating a city's electricity demand pattern based on weather, the presence of an electric vehicle, and location, which could be used for capacity planning during a winter freeze. Such real-world time series are often enriched with paired heterogeneous contextual metadata (e.g., weather and location). Current approaches to time series generation often ignore this paired metadata. Additionally, the heterogeneity in metadata poses several practical challenges in adapting existing conditional generation approaches from the image, audio, and video domains to the time series domain. To address this gap, we introduce TIME WEAVER, a novel diffusion-based model that leverages the heterogeneous metadata in the form of categorical, continuous, and even time-variant variables to significantly improve time series generation. Additionally, we show that naive extensions of standard evaluation metrics from the image to the time series domain are insufficient. These metrics do not penalize conditional generation approaches for their poor specificity in reproducing the metadata-specific features in the generated time series. Thus, we innovate a novel evaluation metric that accurately captures the specificity of conditional generation and the realism of the generated time series. We show that TIME WEAVER outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by up to 30% in downstream classification tasks on real-world energy, medical, air quality, and traffic datasets.

Title: Constrained Posterior Sampling: Time Series Generation with Hard Constraints
Authors: Sai Shankar Narasimhan, Shubhankar Agarwal, Litu Rout, Sanjay Shakkottai, Sandeep P. Chinchali
Abstract: Generating realistic time series samples is crucial for stress-testing models and protecting user privacy by using synthetic data. In engineering and safety-critical applications, these samples must meet certain hard constraints that are domain-specific or naturally imposed by physics or nature. Consider, for example, generating electricity demand patterns with constraints on peak demand times. This can be used to stress-test the functioning of power grids during adverse weather conditions. Existing approaches for generating constrained time series are either not scalable or degrade sample quality. To address these challenges, we introduce Constrained Posterior Sampling (CPS), a diffusion-based sampling algorithm that aims to project the posterior mean estimate into the constraint set after each denoising update. Notably, CPS scales to a large number of constraints ($\sim100$) without requiring additional training. We provide theoretical justifications highlighting the impact of our projection step on sampling. Empirically, CPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in sample quality and similarity to real time series by around 70\% and 22\%, respectively, on real-world stocks, traffic, and air quality datasets.

Title: Agile and Cooperative Aerial Manipulation of a Cable-Suspended Load
Authors: Sihao Sun, Xuerui Wang, Dario Sanalitro, Antonio Franchi, Marco Tognon, Javier Alonso-Mora
Abstract: Quadrotors can carry slung loads to hard-to-reach locations at high speed. Since a single quadrotor has limited payload capacities, using a team of quadrotors to collaboratively manipulate a heavy object is a scalable and promising solution. However, existing control algorithms for multi-lifting systems only enable low-speed and low-acceleration operations due to the complex dynamic coupling between quadrotors and the load, limiting their use in time-critical missions such as search and rescue. In this work, we present a solution to significantly enhance the agility of cable-suspended multi-lifting systems. Unlike traditional cascaded solutions, we introduce a trajectory-based framework that solves the whole-body kinodynamic motion planning problem online, accounting for the dynamic coupling effects and constraints between the quadrotors and the load. The planned trajectory is provided to the quadrotors as a reference in a receding-horizon fashion and is tracked by an onboard controller that observes and compensates for the cable tension. Real-world experiments demonstrate that our framework can achieve at least eight times greater acceleration than state-of-the-art methods to follow agile trajectories. Our method can even perform complex maneuvers such as flying through narrow passages at high speed. Additionally, it exhibits high robustness against load uncertainties and does not require adding any sensors to the load, demonstrating strong practicality.

Title: Quality Over Quantity? LLM-Based Curation for a Data-Efficient Audio-Video Foundation Model
Authors: Ali Vosoughi, Dimitra Emmanouilidou, Hannes Gamper
Abstract: Integrating audio and visual data for training multimodal foundational models remains a challenge. The Audio-Video Vector Alignment (AVVA) framework addresses this by considering AV scene alignment beyond mere temporal synchronization, and leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for data curation. AVVA implements a scoring mechanism for selecting aligned training data segments. It integrates Whisper, a speech-based foundation model, for audio and DINOv2 for video analysis in a dual-encoder structure with contrastive learning on AV pairs. Evaluations on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model architecture and data curation approach. AVVA achieves a significant improvement in top-k accuracies for video-to-audio retrieval on all datasets compared to DenseAV, while using only 192 hrs of curated training data. Furthermore, an ablation study indicates that the data curation process effectively trades data quality for data quantity, yielding increases in top-k retrieval accuracies on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound, compared to training on the full spectrum of uncurated data.

Title: Smart Exploration in Reinforcement Learning using Bounded Uncertainty Models
Authors: J.S. van Hulst, W.P.M.H. Heemels, D.J. Antunes
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework for decision-making in uncertain environments, but it often requires large amounts of data to learn an optimal policy. We address this challenge by incorporating prior model knowledge to guide exploration and accelerate the learning process. Specifically, we assume access to a model set that contains the true transition kernel and reward function. We optimize over this model set to obtain upper and lower bounds on the Q-function, which are then used to guide the exploration of the agent. We provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of the Q-function to the optimal Q-function under the proposed class of exploring policies. Furthermore, we also introduce a data-driven regularized version of the model set optimization problem that ensures the convergence of the class of exploring policies to the optimal policy. Lastly, we show that when the model set has a specific structure, namely the bounded-parameter MDP (BMDP) framework, the regularized model set optimization problem becomes convex and simple to implement. In this setting, we also prove finite-time convergence to the optimal policy under mild assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed exploration strategy, which we call BUMEX (Bounded Uncertainty Model-based Exploration), in a simulation study. The results indicate that the proposed method can significantly accelerate learning in benchmark examples. A toolbox is available at this https URL.

Title: ARECHO: Autoregressive Evaluation via Chain-Based Hypothesis Optimization for Speech Multi-Metric Estimation
Authors: Jiatong Shi, Yifan Cheng, Bo-Hao Su, Hye-jin Shim, Jinchuan Tian, Samuele Cornell, Yiwen Zhao, Siddhant Arora, Shinji Watanabe
Abstract: Speech signal analysis poses significant challenges, particularly in tasks such as speech quality evaluation and profiling, where the goal is to predict multiple perceptual and objective metrics. For instance, metrics like PESQ (Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality), STOI (Short-Time Objective Intelligibility), and MOS (Mean Opinion Score) each capture different aspects of speech quality. However, these metrics often have different scales, assumptions, and dependencies, making joint estimation non-trivial. To address these issues, we introduce ARECHO (Autoregressive Evaluation via Chain-based Hypothesis Optimization), a chain-based, versatile evaluation system for speech assessment grounded in autoregressive dependency modeling. ARECHO is distinguished by three key innovations: (1) a comprehensive speech information tokenization pipeline; (2) a dynamic classifier chain that explicitly captures inter-metric dependencies; and (3) a two-step confidence-oriented decoding algorithm that enhances inference reliability. Experiments demonstrate that ARECHO significantly outperforms the baseline framework across diverse evaluation scenarios, including enhanced speech analysis, speech generation evaluation, and, noisy speech evaluation. Furthermore, its dynamic dependency modeling improves interpretability by capturing inter-metric relationships. Across tasks, ARECHO offers reference-free evaluation using its dynamic classifier chain to support subset queries (single or multiple metrics) and reduces error propagation via confidence-oriented decoding.

Title: SignalLLM: A General-Purpose LLM Agent Framework for Automated Signal Processing
Authors: Junlong Ke, Qiying Hu, Shenghai Yuan, Yuecong Xu, Jianfei Yang
Abstract: Modern signal processing (SP) pipelines, whether model-based or data-driven, often constrained by complex and fragmented workflow, rely heavily on expert knowledge and manual engineering, and struggle with adaptability and generalization under limited data. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning capabilities, broad general-purpose knowledge, in-context learning, and cross-modal transfer abilities, positioning them as powerful tools for automating and generalizing SP workflows. Motivated by these potentials, we introduce SignalLLM, the first general-purpose LLM-based agent framework for general SP tasks. Unlike prior LLM-based SP approaches that are limited to narrow applications or tricky prompting, SignalLLM introduces a principled, modular architecture. It decomposes high-level SP goals into structured subtasks via in-context learning and domain-specific retrieval, followed by hierarchical planning through adaptive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and refinement; these subtasks are then executed through prompt-based reasoning, cross-modal reasoning, code synthesis, model invocation, or data-driven LLM-assisted modeling. Its generalizable design enables the flexible selection of problem solving strategies across different signal modalities, task types, and data conditions. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of SignalLLM through five representative tasks in communication and sensing, such as radar target detection, human activity recognition, and text compression. Experimental results show superior performance over traditional and existing LLM-based methods, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot settings.

Title: Cryo-CMOS Antenna for Wireless Communications within a Quantum Computer Cryostat
Authors: Viviana Centritto, Ama Bandara, Heqi Deng, Masoud Babaie, Evgenii Vinogradov, Sergi Abadal, Eduard Alarcon
Abstract: Scaling quantum computers from a few qubits to large numbers remains one of the critical challenges in realizing practical quantum advantage. Multi-core quantum architectures have emerged as a promising solution, enabling scalability through distributed quantum processing units (QPUs) interconnected via classical and quantum links. However, the bottleneck of wired connections persists, as densely packed wired interconnects, both vertically across temperature stages and horizontally within the same layer, introduce spatial constraints, power dissipation, and latency, which could hinder performance as the number of QPUs increases. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a cryo-compatible on-chip differential dipole antenna operating at 28 GHz to enable short-range wireless communication within a quantum computer cryostat. Temperature-dependent material properties are incorporated to accurately capture antenna behavior at 4 K. Moreover, by embedding the antenna in a realistic cryostat structure, we evaluate the feasibility of antenna operation within the cryogenic environment. The proposed antenna achieves a reflection coefficient of -20.8 dB in free space and -18.38 dB within the cryostat, demonstrating efficient impedance matching.

Title: Audio Signal Processing Using Time Domain Mel-Frequency Wavelet Coefficient
Authors: Rinku Sebastian, Simon O'Keefe, Martin Trefzer
Abstract: Extracting features from the speech is the most critical process in speech signal processing. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are the most widely used features in the majority of the speaker and speech recognition applications, as the filtering in this feature is similar to the filtering taking place in the human ear. But the main drawback of this feature is that it provides only the frequency information of the signal but does not provide the information about at what time which frequency is present. The wavelet transform, with its flexible time-frequency window, provides time and frequency information of the signal and is an appropriate tool for the analysis of non-stationary signals like speech. On the other hand, because of its uniform frequency scaling, a typical wavelet transform may be less effective in analysing speech signals, have poorer frequency resolution in low frequencies, and be less in line with human auditory perception. Hence, it is necessary to develop a feature that incorporates the merits of both MFCC and wavelet transform. A great deal of studies are trying to combine both these features. The present Wavelet Transform based Mel-scaled feature extraction methods require more computation when a wavelet transform is applied on top of Mel-scale filtering, since it adds extra processing steps. Here we are proposing a method to extract Mel scale features in time domain combining the concept of wavelet transform, thus reducing the computational burden of time-frequency conversion and the complexity of wavelet extraction. Combining our proposed Time domain Mel frequency Wavelet Coefficient(TMFWC) technique with the reservoir computing methodology has significantly improved the efficiency of audio signal processing.

Title: Evaluating Emotion Recognition in Spoken Language Models on Emotionally Incongruent Speech
Authors: Pedro Corr√™a, Jo√£o Lima, Victor Moreno, Lucas Ueda, Paula Dornhofer Paro Costa
Abstract: Advancements in spoken language processing have driven the development of spoken language models (SLMs), designed to achieve universal audio understanding by jointly learning text and audio representations for a wide range of tasks. Although promising results have been achieved, there is growing discussion regarding these models' generalization capabilities and the extent to which they truly integrate audio and text modalities in their internal representations. In this work, we evaluate four SLMs on the task of speech emotion recognition using a dataset of emotionally incongruent speech samples, a condition under which the semantic content of the spoken utterance conveys one emotion while speech expressiveness conveys another. Our results indicate that SLMs rely predominantly on textual semantics rather than speech emotion to perform the task, indicating that text-related representations largely dominate over acoustic representations. We release both the code and the Emotionally Incongruent Synthetic Speech dataset (EMIS) to the community.

Abstract: In this work, we propose neighborhood feature pooling (NFP) as a novel texture feature extraction method for remote sensing image classification. The NFP layer captures relationships between neighboring inputs and efficiently aggregates local similarities across feature dimensions. Implemented using convolutional layers, NFP can be seamlessly integrated into any network. Results comparing the baseline models and the NFP method indicate that NFP consistently improves performance across diverse datasets and architectures while maintaining minimal parameter overhead.

Title: Data-Driven Stabilization Using Prior Knowledge on Stabilizability and Controllability

Abstract: In this work, we study data-driven stabilization of linear time-invariant systems using prior knowledge of system-theoretic properties, specifically stabilizability and controllability. To formalize this, we extend the concept of data informativity by requiring the existence of a controller that stabilizes all systems consistent with the data and the prior knowledge. We show that if the system is controllable, then incorporating this as prior knowledge does not relax the conditions required for data-driven stabilization. Remarkably, however, we show that if the system is stabilizable, then using this as prior knowledge leads to necessary and sufficient conditions that are weaker than those for data-driven stabilization without prior knowledge. In other words, data-driven stabilization is easier if one knows that the underlying system is stabilizable. We also provide new data-driven control design methods in terms of linear matrix inequalities that complement the conditions for informativity.
