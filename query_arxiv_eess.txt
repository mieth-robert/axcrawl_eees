Title: Pigment Network Detection and Classification in Dermoscopic Images Using Directional Imaging Algorithms and Convolutional Neural Networks
Authors: M. A. Rasel, Sameem Abdul Kareem, Unaizah Obaidellah
Abstract: Early diagnosis of melanoma, which can save thousands of lives, relies heavily on the analysis of dermoscopic images. One crucial diagnostic criterion is the identification of unusual pigment network (PN). However, distinguishing between regular (typical) and irregular (atypical) PN is challenging. This study aims to automate the PN detection process using a directional imaging algorithm and classify PN types using machine learning classifiers. The directional imaging algorithm incorporates Principal Component Analysis (PCA), contrast enhancement, filtering, and noise reduction. Applied to the PH2 dataset, this algorithm achieved a 96% success rate, which increased to 100% after pixel intensity adjustments. We created a new dataset containing only PN images from these results. We then employed two classifiers, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bag of Features (BoF), to categorize PN into atypical and typical classes. Given the limited dataset of 200 images, a simple and effective CNN was designed, featuring two convolutional layers and two batch normalization layers. The proposed CNN achieved 90% accuracy, 90% sensitivity, and 89% specificity. When compared to state-of-the-art methods, our CNN demonstrated superior performance. Our study highlights the potential of the proposed CNN model for effective PN classification, suggesting future research should focus on expanding datasets and incorporating additional dermatological features to further enhance melanoma diagnosis.

Title: FourierPET: Deep Fourier-based Unrolled Network for Low-count PET Reconstruction
Authors: Zheng Zhang, Hao Tang, Yingying Hu, Zhanli Hu, Jing Qin
Abstract: Low-count positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction is a challenging inverse problem due to severe degradations arising from Poisson noise, photon scarcity, and attenuation correction errors. Existing deep learning methods typically address these in the spatial domain with an undifferentiated optimization objective, making it difficult to disentangle overlapping artifacts and limiting correction effectiveness. In this work, we perform a Fourier-domain analysis and reveal that these degradations are spectrally separable: Poisson noise and photon scarcity cause high-frequency phase perturbations, while attenuation errors suppress low-frequency amplitude components. Leveraging this insight, we propose FourierPET, a Fourier-based unrolled reconstruction framework grounded in the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. It consists of three tailored modules: a spectral consistency module that enforces global frequency alignment to maintain data fidelity, an amplitude-phase correction module that decouples and compensates for high-frequency phase distortions and low-frequency amplitude suppression, and a dual adjustment module that accelerates convergence during iterative reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FourierPET achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly fewer parameters, while offering enhanced interpretability through frequency-aware correction.

Title: Mobile-friendly Image de-noising: Hardware Conscious Optimization for Edge Application
Authors: Srinivas Miriyala, Sowmya Vajrala, Hitesh Kumar, Sravanth Kodavanti, Vikram Rajendiran
Abstract: Image enhancement is a critical task in computer vision and photography that is often entangled with noise. This renders the traditional Image Signal Processing (ISP) ineffective compared to the advances in deep learning. However, the success of such methods is increasingly associated with the ease of their deployment on edge devices, such as smartphones. This work presents a novel mobile-friendly network for image de-noising obtained with Entropy-Regularized differentiable Neural Architecture Search (NAS) on a hardware-aware search space for a U-Net architecture, which is first-of-its-kind. The designed model has 12% less parameters, with ~2-fold improvement in ondevice latency and 1.5-fold improvement in the memory footprint for a 0.7% drop in PSNR, when deployed and profiled on Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. Compared to the SOTA Swin-Transformer for Image Restoration, the proposed network had competitive accuracy with ~18-fold reduction in GMACs. Further, the network was tested successfully for Gaussian de-noising with 3 intensities on 4 benchmarks and real-world de-noising on 1 benchmark demonstrating its generalization ability.

Title: Towards Efficient Image Deblurring for Edge Deployment
Authors: Srinivas Miriyala, Sowmya Vajrala, Sravanth Kodavanti
Abstract: Image deblurring is a critical stage in mobile image signal processing pipelines, where the ability to restore fine structures and textures must be balanced with real-time constraints on edge devices. While recent deep networks such as transformers and activation-free architectures achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy, their efficiency is typically measured in FLOPs or parameters, which do not correlate with latency on embedded hardware. We propose a hardware-aware adaptation framework that restructures existing models through sensitivity-guided block substitution, surrogate distillation, and training-free multi-objective search driven by device profiling. Applied to the 36-block NAFNet baseline, the optimized variants achieve up to 55% reduction in GMACs compared to the recent transformer-based SOTA while maintaining competitive accuracy. Most importantly, on-device deployment yields a 1.25X latency improvement over the baseline. Experiments on motion deblurring (GoPro), defocus deblurring (DPDD), and auxiliary benchmarks (RealBlur-J/R, HIDE) demonstrate the generality of the approach, while comparisons with prior efficient baselines confirm its accuracy-efficiency trade-off. These results establish feedback-driven adaptation as a principled strategy for bridging the gap between algorithmic design and deployment-ready deblurring models.

Title: Bridging Modalities: Joint Synthesis and Registration Framework for Aligning Diffusion MRI with T1-Weighted Images
Authors: Xiaofan Wang, Junyi Wang, Yuqian Chen, Lauren J. O' Donnell, Fan Zhang
Abstract: Multimodal image registration between diffusion MRI (dMRI) and T1-weighted (T1w) MRI images is a critical step for aligning diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data with structural anatomical space. Traditional registration methods often struggle to ensure accuracy due to the large intensity differences between diffusion data and high-resolution anatomical structures. This paper proposes an unsupervised registration framework based on a generative registration network, which transforms the original multimodal registration problem between b0 and T1w images into a unimodal registration task between a generated image and the real T1w image. This effectively reduces the complexity of cross-modal registration. The framework first employs an image synthesis model to generate images with T1w-like contrast, and then learns a deformation field from the generated image to the fixed T1w image. The registration network jointly optimizes local structural similarity and cross-modal statistical dependency to improve deformation estimation accuracy. Experiments conducted on two independent datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in multimodal registration tasks.

Title: Explainable histomorphology-based survival prediction of glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype
Authors: Jan-Philipp Redlich, Friedrich Feuerhake, Stefan Nikolin, Nadine Sarah Schaadt, Sarah Teuber-Hanselmann, Joachim Weis, Sabine Luttmann, Andrea Eberle, Christoph Buck, Timm Intemann, Pascal Birnstill, Klaus Kraywinkel, Jonas Ort, Peter Boor, André Homeyer
Abstract: Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype (GBM-IDHwt) is the most common malignant brain tumor. Histomorphology is a crucial component of the integrated diagnosis of GBM-IDHwt. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have shown promise to extract additional prognostic information from histological whole-slide images (WSI) of hematoxylin and eosin-stained glioblastoma tissue. Here, we present an explainable AI-based method to support systematic interpretation of histomorphological features associated with survival. It combines an explainable multiple instance learning (MIL) architecture with a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to relate human-interpretable visual patterns of tissue to survival. The MIL architecture directly identifies prognosis-relevant image tiles and the SAE maps these tiles post-hoc to visual patterns. The MIL method was trained and evaluated using a new real-world dataset that comprised 720 GBM-IDHwt cases from three hospitals and four cancer registries in Germany. The SAE was trained using 1878 WSIs of glioblastoma from five independent public data collections. Despite the many factors influencing survival time, our method showed some ability to discriminate between patients living less than 180 days or more than 360 days solely based on histomorphology (AUC: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.63-0.72). Cox proportional hazards regression confirmed a significant difference in survival time between the predicted groups after adjustment for established prognostic factors (hazard ratio: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.26-1.72). Our method identified multiple interpretable visual patterns associated with survival. Three neuropathologists separately found that 21 of the 24 most strongly associated patterns could be clearly attributed to seven histomorphological categories. Necrosis and hemorrhage appeared to be associated with shorter survival while highly cellular tumor areas were associated with longer survival.

Title: Inter-Cell Interference Rejection Based on Ultrawideband Walsh-Domain Wireless Autoencoding
Authors: Rodney Martinez Alonso, Cel Thys, Cedric Dehos, Yuneisy Esthela Garcia Guzman, Sofie Pollin
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel technique for rejecting partial-in-band inter-cell interference (ICI) in ultrawideband communication systems. We present the design of an end-to-end wireless autoencoder architecture that jointly optimizes the transmitter and receiver encoding/decoding in the Walsh domain to mitigate interference from coexisting narrower-band 5G base stations. By exploiting the orthogonality and self-inverse properties of Walsh functions, the system distributes and learns to encode bit-words across parallel Walsh branches. Through analytical modeling and simulation, we characterize how 5G CPOFDM interference maps into the Walsh domain and identify optimal ratios of transmission frequencies and sampling rate where the end-to-end autoencoder achieves the highest rejection. Experimental results show that the proposed autoencoder achieves up to 12 dB of ICI rejection while maintaining a low block error rate (BLER) for the same baseline channel noise, i.e., baseline Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) without the interference.

Title: Sparsity Realization in User-Side Multilayer RIS
Authors: Hasan M. Boudi, Taissir Y. Elganimi
Abstract: User-side reconfigurable intelligent surface (US-RIS)-aided communication has recently emerged as a promising solution to overcome the high hardware cost and physical size limitations of large-scale user side antenna arrays. This letter proposes, for the first time, a framework that realizes sparsity in multilayer US-RIS using two strategies, namely element-wise sparsity and geometric sparsity. The element-wise approach distributes a limited number of active elements irregularly across multiple layers, thereby exploiting additional spatial degrees of freedom and boosting the achievable rate. For further performance enhancement, a novel foldable RIS architecture leveraging geometric sparsity is proposed, achieving additional gains by optimizing the folding topology of its multilayer structure. Simulation results show that the proposed sparse architectures provide consistently higher achievable rates than existing designs.

Title: LarS-Net: A Large-Scale Framework for Network-Level Spectrum Sensing
Authors: Hao Guo, Ruoyu Sun, Amir Hossein Fahim Raouf, Rahil Gandotra, Jiayu Mao, Mark Poletti
Abstract: As the demand of wireless communication continues to rise, the radio spectrum (a finite resource) requires increasingly efficient utilization. This trend is driving the evolution from static, stand-alone spectrum allocation toward spectrum sharing and dynamic spectrum sharing. A critical element of this transition is spectrum sensing, which facilitates informed decision-making in shared environments. Previous studies on spectrum sensing and cognitive radio have been largely limited to individual sensors or small sensor groups. In this work, a large-scale spectrum sensing network (LarS-Net) is designed in a cost-effective manner. Spectrum sensors are either co-located with base stations (BSs) to share the tower, backhaul, and power infrastructure, or integrated directly into BSs as a new feature leveraging active BS antenna systems. As an example incumbent system, fixed service microwave link operating in the lower-7 GHz band is investigated. This band is a primary candidate for 6G, being considered by the WRC-23, ITU, and FCC. Based on Monte Carlo simulations, we determine the minimum subset of BSs equipped with sensing capability to guarantee a target incumbent detection probability. The simulations account for various sensor antenna configurations, propagation channel models, and duty cycles for both incumbent transmissions and sensing operations. Building on this framework, we introduce three network-level sensing performance metrics: Emission Detection Probability (EDP), Temporal Detection Probability (TDP), and Temporal Mis-detection Probability (TMP), which jointly capture spatial coverage, temporal detectability, and multi-node diversity effects. Using these metrics, we analyze the impact of LarS-Net inter-site distance, noise uncertainty, and sensing duty-cycle on large-scale sensing performance.

Title: MIMO Array Calibration in Non-stationary Channels with Residual Surfaces and Slepian Spherical Harmonics
Authors: Oliver Kirkpatrick, Santiago Ozafrain, Christopher Gilliam, Beth Jelfs
Abstract: The fundamental mechanism driving MIMO beamforming is the relative phases of signals departing the transmit array and arriving at the receive array. If a propagation channel affects all transmitted signals equally, the relative phases are a function of the directions of departure and arrival, as well as the transmit and receive hardware. In a non-stationary channel, the amplitudes and phases of arriving signals may vary significantly over time, making it infeasible to directly measure the influence of hardware. In this paper, we present a calibration method for achieving indirect measurement and compensation of hardware influences in non-stationary channels. Our method characterizes the patterns of array elements relative to a reference element and estimates these relative patterns, termed residual surfaces, using a Slepian spherical harmonic basis. Using simulations, we demonstrate that our calibration method achieves beamforming gains that closely match theoretical optimums. Our results also show a reduction in the error in estimating the target direction, lower side lobes, and improve null-steering capabilities.

Title: AI-Driven Spectrum Occupancy Prediction Using Real-World Spectrum Measurements
Authors: Jiayu Mao, Ruoyu Sun, Mark Poletti, Rahil Gandotra, Hao Guo, Aylin Yener
Abstract: Spectrum occupancy prediction is a critical enabler for real-time and proactive dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS), as it can provide short-term channel availability information to support more efficient spectrum access decisions in wireless communication systems. Instead of relying on open-source datasets or simulated data, commonly used in the literature, this paper investigates short-horizon spectrum occupancy prediction using mid-band, 24X7 real-world spectrum measurement data collected in the United States. We construct a multi-band channel occupancy dataset through analyzing 61 days of empirical data and formulate a next-minute channel occupancy prediction task across all frequency channels. This study focuses on AI-driven prediction methods, including Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, and compares their performance against a conventional Markov chain-based statistical baseline. Numerical results show that learning-based methods outperform the statistical baseline on dynamic channels, particularly under fixed false-alarm constraints. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of AI-driven spectrum occupancy prediction, indicating that lightweight learning models can effectively support future deployment-oriented DSS systems.

Title: Automated Spectrum Sensing and Analysis Framework
Authors: Rahil Gandotra, Ruoyu Sun, Mark Poletti, Jiayu Mao, Hao Guo
Abstract: Spectrum sensing and analysis is crucial for a variety of reasons, including regulatory compliance, interference detection and mitigation, and spectrum resource planning and optimization. Effective, real-time spectrum analysis remains a challenge, stemming from the need to analyse an increasingly complex and dynamic environment with limited resources. The vast amount of data generated from sensing the spectrum at multiple sites requires sophisticated data analysis and processing techniques, which can be technically demanding and expensive. This paper presents a novel, holistic framework developed and deployed at multiple locations across the USA for spectrum analysis and describes the different parts of the end-to-end pipeline. The details of each of the modules of the pipeline, data collection and pre-processing at remote locations, transfer to a centralized location, post-processing analysis, visualization, and long-term storage, are reported. The motivation behind this work is to develop a robust spectrum analysis framework that can help gain greater insights into the spectrum usage across the country and augment additional use cases such as dynamic spectrum sharing.

Title: Lightweight Self-Supervised Detection of Fundamental Frequency and Accurate Probability of Voicing in Monophonic Music
Authors: Venkat Suprabath Bitra, Homayoon Beigi
Abstract: Reliable fundamental frequency (F 0) and voicing estimation is essential for neural synthesis, yet many pitch extractors depend on large labeled corpora and degrade under realistic recording artifacts. We propose a lightweight, fully self-supervised framework for joint F 0 estimation and voicing inference, designed for rapid single-instrument training from limited audio. Using transposition-equivariant learning on CQT features, we introduce an EM-style iterative reweighting scheme that uses Shift Cross-Entropy (SCE) consistency as a reliability signal to suppress uninformative noisy/unvoiced frames. The resulting weights provide confidence scores that enable pseudo-labeling for a separate lightweight voicing classifier without manual annotations. Trained on MedleyDB and evaluated on MDB-stem-synth ground truth, our method achieves competitive cross-corpus performance (RPA 95.84, RCA 96.24) and demonstrates cross-instrument generalization.

Title: Modeling and Simulation of Virtual Rigid Body Formations and Their Applications Using Multiple Air Vehicles
Authors: Suguru Sato, Kamesh Subbarao
Abstract: This paper presents thorough mathematical modeling, control law development, and simulation of virtual structure formations which are inspired by the characteristics of rigid bodies. The stable constraint forces that establish the rigidity in the formation are synthesized by utilizing d'Alembert's principle of virtual work, constraint sensitivities (Lagrange multipliers) and constraint stabilization using Baumgarte stabilization. The governing equations of motion of a multiagent system are derived via Newton's and Euler's equations to include these constraint forces and to enable inputs regarding the formation as if it were an independent rigid body. The performance of this framework is evaluated under multiple cases including waypoint following missions, and using different number of agents.

Title: Necessity of Cooperative Transmissions for Wireless MapReduce
Authors: Yue Bi, Michèle Wigger
Abstract: The paper presents an improved upper bound (achievability result) on the optimal tradeoff between Normalized Delivery Time (NDT) and computation load for distributed computing MapReduce systems in certain ranges of the parameters. The upper bound is based on interference alignment combined with zero-forcing. The paper further provides a lower bound (converse) on the optimal NDT-computation tradeoff that can be achieved when IVAs are partitioned into sub-IVAs, and these sub-IVAs are then transmitted (in an arbitrary form) by a single node, without cooperation among nodes. For appropriate linear functions (e.g., XORs), such non-cooperative schemes can achieve some of the best NDT-computation tradeoff points so far obtained in the literature. However, as our lower bound shows, any non-cooperative scheme achieves a worse NDT-computation tradeoff than our new proposed scheme for certain parameters, thus proving the necessity of cooperative schemes like zero-forcing to attain the optimal NDT-computation tradeoff.

Title: Delay-Doppler-Domain Channel Estimation and Reduced-Complexity Detection of Faster-than-Nyquist Signaling Aided OTFS
Authors: Zekun Hong, Shinya Sugiura, Chao Xu, Lajos Hanzo
Abstract: We conceive a novel channel estimation and data detection scheme for OTFS-modulated faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) transmission over doubly selective fading channels, aiming for enhancing the spectral efficiency and Doppler resilience. The delay-Doppler (DD) domain's input-output relationship of OTFS-FTN signaling is derived by employing a root-raised cosine (RRC) shaping filter. More specifically, we design our DD-domain channel estimator for FTN-based pilot transmission, where the pilot symbol interval is lower than that defined by the classic Nyquist criterion. Moreover, we propose a reduced-complexity linear minimum mean square error equalizer, supporting noise whitening, where the FTN-induced inter-symbol interference (ISI) matrix is approximated by a sparse one. Our performance results demonstrate that the proposed OTFS-FTN scheme is capable of enhancing the achievable information rate, while attaining a comparable BER performance to both that of its Nyquist-based OTFS counterpart and to other FTN transmission schemes, which employ the same RRC shaping filter.

Title: Accelerated MR Elastography Using Learned Neural Network Representation
Authors: Xi Peng
Abstract: To develop a deep-learning method for achieving fast high-resolution MR elastography from highly undersampled data without the need of high-quality training dataset. We first framed the deep neural network representation as a nonlinear extension of the linear subspace model, then used it to represent and reconstruct MRE image repetitions from undersampled k-space data. The network weights were learned using a multi-level k-space consistent loss in a self-supervised manner. To further enhance reconstruction quality, phase-contrast specific magnitude and phase priors were incorporated, including the similarity of anatomical structures and smoothness of wave-induced harmonic displacement. Experiments were conducted using both 3D gradient-echo spiral and multi-slice spin-echo spiral MRE datasets. Compared to the conventional linear subspace-based approaches, the nonlinear network representation method was able to produce superior image reconstruction with suppressed noise and artifacts from a single in-plane spiral arm per MRE repetition (e.g., total R=10), yielding comparable stiffness estimation to the fully sampled data. This work demonstrated the feasibility of using deep network representations to model and reconstruct MRE images from highly-undersampled data, a nonlinear extension of the subspace-based approaches.

Title: Beyond Target-Level: ISAC-Enabled Event-Level Sensing for Behavioral Intention Prediction
Authors: Haotian Liu, Zhiqing Wei, Yucong Du, Jiachen Wei, Xingwang Li, Zhiyong Feng
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) holds great promise for enabling event-level sensing, such as behavioral intention prediction (BIP) in autonomous driving, particularly under non-line-of-sight (NLoS) or adverse weather conditions where conventional sensors degrade. However, as a key instance of event-level sensing, ISAC-based BIP remains unexplored. To address this gap, we propose an ISAC-enabled BIP framework and validate its feasibility and effectiveness through extensive simulations. Our framework achieves robust performance in safety-critical scenarios, improving the F1-score by 11.4% over sensor-based baselines in adverse weather, thereby demonstrating ISAC's potential for intelligent event-level sensing.

Title: Least-Squares Multi-Step Koopman Operator Learning for Model Predictive Control
Authors: Liang Wu, Wallace Gian Yion Tan, Leqi Zhou, Richard D. Braatz, Jan Drgona
Abstract: MPC is widely used in real-time applications, but practical implementations are typically restricted to convex QP formulations to ensure fast and certified execution. Koopman-based MPC enables QP-based control of nonlinear systems by lifting the dynamics to a higher-dimensional linear representation. However, existing approaches rely on single-step EDMD. Consequently, prediction errors may accumulate over long horizons when the EDMD operator is applied recursively. Moreover, the multi-step prediction loss is nonconvex with respect to the single-step EDMD operator, making long-horizon model identification particularly challenging. This paper proposes a multi-step EDMD framework that directly learns the condensed multi-step state-control mapping required for Koopman-MPC, thereby bypassing explicit identification of the lifted system matrices and subsequent model condensation. The resulting identification problem admits a convex least-squares formulation. We further show that the problem decomposes across prediction horizons and state coordinates, enabling parallel computation and row-wise $\ell_1$-regularization for automatic dictionary pruning. A non-asymptotic finite-sample analysis demonstrates that, unlike one-step EDMD, the proposed method avoids error compounding and yields error bounds that depend only on the target multi-step mapping. Numerical examples validate improved long-horizon prediction accuracy and closed-loop performance.

Title: Radar-Based Fall Detection for Assisted Living: A Digital-Twin Representation Case Study
Authors: Sebastian Ratto V, Huy Trinh, Ahmed N. Sayed, Abdelrahman Elbadrawy, Arien Sligar, George Shaker
Abstract: Obtaining data on high-impact falls from older adults is ethically difficult, yet these rare events cause many fall-related health problems. As a result, most radar-based fall detectors are trained on staged falls from young volunteers, and representation choices are rarely tested against the radar signals from dangerous falls. This paper uses a frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar digital twin as a single simulated room testbed to study how representation choice affects fall/non-fall discrimination. From the same simulated range-Doppler sequence, Doppler-time spectrograms, three-channel per-receiver spectrogram stacks, and time-pooled range-Doppler maps (RDMs) are derived and fed to an identical compact CNN under matched training on a balanced fall/non-fall dataset. In this twin, temporal spectrograms reach 98-99% test accuracy with similar precision and recall for both classes, while static RDMs reach 89.4% and show more variable training despite using the same backbone. A qualitative comparison between synthetic and measured fall spectrograms suggests that the twin captures gross Doppler-time structure, but amplitude histograms reveal differences in the distributions of amplitude values consistent with receiver processing not modeled in the twin. Because the twin omits noise and hardware impairments and is only qualitatively compared to a single measured example, these results provide representation-level guidance under controlled synthetic conditions rather than ready-to-use clinical performance in real settings.

Title: Structured μ-Synthesis for Nanopositioners under Payload-Induced Uncertainties: Minimising Conservatism for Robust Performance
Authors: Manavi Araga, Aditya Natu, Hassan HosseinNia
Abstract: Most systems exhibit significant variability in their dynamics, including variations in system parameters and large high-frequency dynamic uncertainties. Traditional uncertainty modelling techniques consolidate all such variations into a single uncertainty block, often yielding overly conservative representations of the true plant behaviour. This paper introduces an uncertainty modelling framework that employs multiple structured and unstructured uncertainty blocks to reduce this conservatism. The methodology is evaluated for an industrial piezoelectric nanopositioner subject to payload-induced variations, using uncertainty models of differing complexity. A bandpass controller is synthesised via structured mixed-{\mu} synthesis, and the resulting designs are compared in terms of conservatism of the uncertainty model, robust performance, and computational effort.

Title: A Constraint Programming Model for the Super-Agile Earth Observation Satellite Imaging Scheduling Problem
Authors: Margarida Caleiras, Samuel Moniz, Paulo Nascimento
Abstract: As the dependence on satellite imaging continues to grow, modern satellites have become increasingly agile, with the new generation, namely super-agile Earth observation satellites (SAEOS), providing unprecedented imaging flexibility. The highly dynamic capabilities of these satellites introduce additional challenges to the scheduling of observation tasks, as existing approaches for conventional agile satellites do not account for variable observation durations and multiple imaging directions. Although some efforts have been made in this regard, the SAEOS imaging scheduling problem (SAEOS-ISP) remains largely unexplored, and no exact approaches have yet been proposed. In this context, this study presents the first exact Constraint Programming formulation for the SAEOS-ISP, considering flexible observation windows, multiple pointing directions and sequence-dependent transition times across multiple satellites. Computational experiments on a newly generated benchmark set demonstrate that the model can be solved efficiently and within very short computational times. Moreover, the results also show that the proposed approach has the potential to achieve higher computational performance compared to the non-exact approaches that are currently considered state-of-the-art.

Title: Robust distributed extended Kalman filter based on adaptive multi-kernel mixture maximum correntropy for non-Gaussian systems
Authors: Duc Viet Nguyen, Haiquan Zhao, Jinhui Hu, Xiaoli Li
Abstract: As one of the most advanced variants in the correntropy family, the multi-kernel correntropy criterion demonstrates superior accuracy in handling non-Gaussian noise, particularly with multimodal distributions. However, current approaches suffer from key limitations-namely, reliance on a single type of sensitive Gaussian kernel and the manual selection of free parameters. To address these issues and further boost robustness, this paper introduces the concept of multi-kernel mixture correntropy (MKMC), along with its key properties. MKMC employs a flexible kernel function composed of a mixture of two Students t-Cauchy functions with adjustable (non-zero) means. Building on this criterion within multi-sensor networks, we propose a robust distributed extended Kalman filter-AMKMMC-RDEKF based on adaptive multi-kernel mixture maximum correntropy. To reduce communication overhead, a consensus averaging strategy is incorporated. Furthermore, an adaptive mechanism is introduced to mitigate the impact of manually tuned free parameters. At the same time, the computational complexity and convergence ability of the proposed algorithm are analyzed. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through challenging scenarios involving power system and land vehicle state estimation.

Title: NiMark: A Non-intrusive Watermarking Framework against Screen-shooting Attacks
Authors: Yufeng Wu, Xin Liao, Baowei Wang, Han Fang, Xiaoshuai Wu, Guiling Wang
Abstract: Unauthorized screen-shooting poses a critical data leakage risk. Resisting screen-shooting attacks typically requires high-strength watermark embedding, inevitably degrading the cover image. To resolve the robustness-fidelity conflict, non-intrusive watermarking has emerged as a solution by constructing logical verification keys without altering the original content. However, existing non-intrusive schemes lack the capacity to withstand screen-shooting noise. While deep learning offers a potential remedy, we observe that directly applying it leads to a previously underexplored failure mode, the Structural Shortcut: networks tend to learn trivial identity mappings and neglect the image-watermark binding. Furthermore, even when logical binding is enforced, standard training strategies cannot fully bridge the noise gap, yielding suboptimal robustness against physical distortions. In this paper, we propose NiMark, an end-to-end framework addressing these challenges. First, to eliminate the structural shortcut, we introduce the Sigmoid-Gated XOR (SG-XOR) estimator to enable gradient propagation for the logical operation, effectively enforcing rigid image-watermark binding. Second, to overcome the robustness bottleneck, we devise a two-stage training strategy integrating a restorer to bridge the domain gap caused by screen-shooting noise. Experiments demonstrate that NiMark consistently outperforms representative state-of-the-art methods against both digital attacks and screen-shooting noise, while maintaining zero visual distortion.

Title: Decentralized Motion and Resonant Damping Control for High-Bandwidth and Cross-Coupling Reduction in MIMO Nanopositioners
Authors: Aditya Natu, Hassan HosseinNia
Abstract: Piezoelectric nanopositioning systems are widely used in precision applications that require nanometer accuracy and high-speed motion; however, lightly damped resonances and pronounced cross-axis coupling severely limit bandwidth and disturbance rejection. This paper presents a decentralized dual-loop control strategy for a two-axis nanopositioner, combining an inner non-minimum-phase resonant damping controller with an outer motion controller on each axis. The dominant diagonal resonance is actively damped to enable closed-loop bandwidths beyond the first structural mode, while a parallel band-pass damping path is specifically tuned to a higher-order resonance that predominantly affects the cross-coupling channels. Experimental results demonstrate that this targeted band-pass damping substantially reduces cross-axis coupling and enhances disturbance rejection, without compromising tracking accuracy.

Title: Profit Maximization for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Using Multiagent Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Kun-Yan Jiang, Wei-Yu Chiu, Yuan-Po Tsai
Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) are increasingly integrated into power grids, offering economic and environmental benefits but introducing challenges due to uncoordinated charging. This study addresses the profit maximization problem for multiple EV charging stations (EVCSs) equipped with energy storage systems (ESS) and renewable energy sources (RES), with the capability for energy trading. We propose a Double Hypernetwork QMIX-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to optimize cooperative energy management under uncertainty in EV demand, renewable generation, and real-time electricity prices. The framework mitigates overestimation bias in value estimation, enables distributed decision-making, and incorporates an internal energy trading mechanism. Numerical experiments using real-world data demonstrate that, compared to standard QMIX, the proposed method achieves approximately 5.3% and 12.7% higher total profit for the two regions, respectively, highlighting its economic and operational efficiency. Additionally, the approach maintains robust performance under varying levels of EV demand uncertainty and renewable energy fluctuations.

Title: Reachability Guarantees for Energy Arbitrage
Authors: Tomás Tapia, Yury Dvorkin
Abstract: This paper introduces a unified framework for battery energy arbitrage under uncertain market prices that integrates chance-constrained terminal state-of-charge requirements with online threshold policies. We first cast the multi-interval arbitrage problem as a stochastic dynamic program enhanced by a probabilistic end-of-horizon state-of-charge (SoC) constraint, ensuring with high confidence that the battery terminates within a prescribed energy band. We then apply a $k$-search algorithm to derive explicit charging (buying) and discharging (selling) thresholds with provable worst-case competitive ratio, and compute the corresponding action probabilities over the decision horizon. To compute exact distributions under operational limits, we develop a probability redistribution pruning method and use it to quantify the likelihood of meeting the terminal SoC band. Leveraging the resulting SoC distribution, we estimate the minimum stopping-time required to satisfy the SoC chance constraint. Computational experiments on historical real price data demonstrate that the proposed framework substantially improves the estimation of SoC evolution and supports chance-constraint satisfaction.

Title: Extended Weighted ABG: A Robust Non-Linear ABG-Based Approach for Optimal Combination of ABG Path-Loss Propagation Models
Authors: David. Casillas-Pérez, Daniel. Merino-Pérez, Silvia. Jiménez-Fernández, J. Antonio. Portilla-Figueras, Sancho. Salcedo-Sanz
Abstract: This paper proposes a robust non-linear generalized path-loss propagation model, the Extended Weighted ABG (EWABG), which efficiently allows generating a path-loss propagation model by combining several available path-loss datasets (from measurements campaigns) and other previously proposed state-of-the-art 5G path-loss propagation models. The EWABG model works by integrating individual path-loss models into one single model in the least-squares sense, allowing to extend knowledge from frequencies and distances covered by path-loss datasets or path-loss propagation models. The proposed EWABG model is the first non-linear extension of the common ABG-based approach, which surpasses the non-uniformity problem between the low and high 5G frequencies (as most measurements campaigns have taken place in low frequencies). The EWABG also addresses the problem of removing outlier measurements, a step not included in previous propagation path-loss models. In this case, we have compared the most recent techniques for avoiding outliers, and we have adopted the Theil-Sen method, due to its strong robustness demonstrated in the experiments carried out. In addition, the proposed model specifically considers non-linear attenuation by atmospheric gases, in order to improve its estimations. The good performance of the proposed EWABG model has been tested and compared against recent 5G propagation path-loss models including the ABG and WABG models. The exhaustive experimentation carried out includes the 5G non-line-of-sight environment in different 5G scenarios, UMiSC, UMiOS and UMa. The proposed EWABG obtains the best accuracy, specially in noisy environments with outliers, reporting negligible increment error rates (with respect to the non-outliers situation), lower than 1%, compared to the ABG and WABG.

Title: Listen, Look, Drive: Coupling Audio Instructions for User-aware VLA-based Autonomous Driving
Authors: Ziang Guo, Feng Yang, Xuefeng Zhang, Jiaqi Guo, Kun Zhao, Peng Lu, Zufeng Zhang, Sifa Zheng
Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models promise an open-vocabulary interface that can translate perceptual ambiguity into semantically grounded driving decisions, yet they still treat language as a static prior fixed at inference time. As a result, the model must infer continuously shifting objectives from pixels alone, yielding delayed or overly conservative maneuvers. We argue that effective VLAs for autonomous driving need an online channel in which users can influence driving with specific intentions. To this end, we present EchoVLA, a user-aware VLA that couples camera streams with in situ audio instructions. We augment the nuScenes dataset with temporally aligned, intent-specific speech commands generated by converting ego-motion descriptions into synthetic audios. Further, we compose emotional speech-trajectory pairs into a multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for fine-tuning a Multimodal Large Model (MLM) based on Qwen2.5-Omni. Specifically, we synthesize the audio-augmented dataset with different emotion types paired with corresponding driving behaviors, leveraging the emotional cues embedded in tone, pitch, and speech tempo to reflect varying user states, such as urgent or hesitant intentions, thus enabling our EchoVLA to interpret not only the semantic content but also the emotional context of audio commands for more nuanced and emotionally adaptive driving behavior. In open-loop benchmarks, our approach reduces the average L2 error by $59.4\%$ and the collision rate by $74.4\%$ compared to the baseline of vision-only perception. More experiments on nuScenes dataset validate that EchoVLA not only steers the trajectory through audio instructions, but also modulates driving behavior in response to the emotions detected in the user's speech.

Title: A Survey on 30+ Years of Automatic Singing Assessment and Singing Information Processing
Authors: Arthur N. dos Santos, Bruno S. Masiero
Abstract: Automatic Singing Assessment and Singing Information Processing have evolved over the past three decades to support singing pedagogy, performance analysis, and vocal training. While the first approach objectively evaluates a singer's performance through computational metrics ranging from real-time visual feedback and acoustical biofeedback to sophisticated pitch tracking and spectral analysis, the latter method compares a predictor vocal signal with a target reference to capture nuanced data embedded in the singing voice. Notable advancements include the development of interactive systems that have significantly improved real-time visual feedback, and the integration of machine learning and deep neural network architectures that enhance the precision of vocal signal processing. This survey critically examines the literature to map the historical evolution of these technologies, while identifying and discussing key gaps. The analysis reveals persistent challenges, such as the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks, difficulties in reliably separating vocal signals from various noise sources, and the underutilization of advanced digital signal processing and artificial intelligence methodologies for capturing artistic expressivity. By detailing these limitations and the corresponding technological advances, this review demonstrates how addressing these issues can bridge the gap between objective computational assessments and subjective human-like evaluations of singing performance, ultimately enhancing both the technical accuracy and pedagogical relevance of automated singing evaluation systems.

Title: Boiling flow estimation for aero-optic phase screen generation
Authors: Jeffrey W. Utley, Gregery T. Buzzard, Charles A. Bouman, Matthew R. Kemnetz
Abstract: Aero-optic effects due to turbulence can reduce the effectiveness of transmitting light waves to a distant target. Methods to compensate for turbulence typically rely on realistic turbulence data, which can be generated by i) experiment, ii) high-fidelity CFD, iii) low-fidelity CFD, and iv) autoregressive methods. However, each of these methods has significant drawbacks, including monetary and/or computational expense, limited quantity, inaccurate statistics, and overall complexity. In contrast, the boiling flow algorithm is a simple, computationally efficient model that can generate atmospheric phase screen data with only a handful of parameters. However, boiling flow has not been widely used in aero-optic applications, at least in part because some of these parameters, such as r0, are not clearly defined for aero-optic data. In this paper, we demonstrate a method to use the boiling flow algorithm to generate arbitrary length synthetic data to match the statistics of measured aero-optic data. Importantly, we modify the standard boiling flow method to generate anisotropic phase screens. While this model does not fully capture all statistics, it can be used to generate data that matches the temporal power spectrum or the anisotropic 2D structure function, with the ability to trade fidelity to one for fidelity to the other.

Abstract: Ultrasound is a cornerstone of emergency and hepatobiliary imaging, yet its interpretation remains highly operator-dependent and time-sensitive. Here, we present a multitask vision-language agent (VLM) developed to assist with comprehensive right upper quadrant (RUQ) ultrasound interpretation across the full diagnostic workflow. The system was trained on a large, multi-center dataset comprising a primary cohort from Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions (9,189 cases, 594,099 images) and externally validated on cohorts from Stanford University (108 cases, 3,240 images) and a major Chinese medical center (257 cases, 3,178 images). Built on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B architecture, the agent integrates frame-level visual understanding with report-grounded language reasoning to perform three tasks: (i) classification of 18 hepatobiliary and gallbladder conditions, (ii) generation of clinically coherent diagnostic reports, and (iii) surgical decision support based on ultrasound findings and clinical data. The model achieved high diagnostic accuracy across all tasks, generated reports that were indistinguishable from expert-written versions in blinded evaluations, and demonstrated superior factual accuracy and information density on content-based metrics. The agent further identified patients requiring cholecystectomy with high precision, supporting real-time decision-making. These results highlight the potential of generalist vision-language models to improve diagnostic consistency, reporting efficiency, and surgical triage in real-world ultrasound practice.

Title: Solvability of The Output Corridor Control Problem by Pulse-Modulated Feedback
Authors: Alexander Medvedev, Anton V. Proskurnikov
Abstract: The problem of maintaining the output of a positive time-invariant single-input single-output system within a predefined corridor of values is treated. For third-order plants possessing a certain structure, it is proven that the problem is always solvable under stationary conditions by means of pulse-modulated feedback. The obtained result is utilized to assess the feasibility of patient-specific pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models with respect to patient safety. A population of Wiener models capturing the dynamics of a neuromuscular blockade agent is studied to investigate whether or not they can be driven into the desired output corridor by clinically acceptable sequential drug doses (boluses). It is demonstrated that low values of a parameter in the nonlinear pharmacodynamic part lie behind the detected model infeasibility.

Title: Analyzing the Impact of EV Battery Charging on the Distribution Network
Authors: Sahil Aziz, Wajid Ali, Khaliqur Rahman
Abstract: Many countries are rapidly adopting electric vehicles (EVs) due to their meager running cost and environment-friendly nature. EVs are likely to dominate the internal combustion (IC) engine cars entirely over the next few years. With the rise in popularity of EVs, adverse effects of EV charging loads on the grid system have been observed. Since the distribution system (DS) does not cope with the high overloading capacity, the negative impact of EV charging load on the distribution network (DN) cannot be neglected. A high level of EV penetration with uncoordinated charging is the primary cause of voltage instability, increased peak load demand, and reliability issues of the DN. In this paper, a detailed overview of all the notable impacts of EV charging on voltage profile, power quality, and DS performance is discussed. This work also reviews the different topologies of EV chargers and the issues introduced by power converters on the utility grid. Finally, the strategies for improving the charging of EVs proposed in the literature to consider the random nature of EVs charging, the management of peak loads, and bidirectional power flow are summarized.

Title: AQUA-Bench: Beyond Finding Answers to Knowing When There Are None in Audio Question Answering
Authors: Chun-Yi Kuan, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: Recent advances in audio-aware large language models have shown strong performance on audio question answering. However, existing benchmarks mainly cover answerable questions and overlook the challenge of unanswerable ones, where no reliable answer can be inferred from the audio. Such cases are common in real-world settings, where questions may be misleading, ill-posed, or incompatible with the information. To address this gap, we present AQUA-Bench, a benchmark for Audio Question Unanswerability Assessment. It systematically evaluates three scenarios: Absent Answer Detection (the correct option is missing), Incompatible Answer Set Detection (choices are categorically mismatched with the question), and Incompatible Audio Question Detection (the question is irrelevant or lacks sufficient grounding in the audio). By assessing these cases, AQUA-Bench offers a rigorous measure of model reliability and promotes the development of audio-language systems that are more robust and trustworthy. Our experiments suggest that while models excel on standard answerable tasks, they often face notable challenges with unanswerable ones, pointing to a blind spot in current audio-language understanding.

Title: DeepRAHT: Learning Predictive RAHT for Point Cloud Attribute Compression
Authors: Chunyang Fu, Tai Qin, Shiqi Wang, Zhu Li
Abstract: Regional Adaptive Hierarchical Transform (RAHT) is an effective point cloud attribute compression (PCAC) method. However, its application in deep learning lacks research. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end RAHT framework for lossy PCAC based on the sparse tensor, called DeepRAHT. The RAHT transform is performed within the learning reconstruction process, without requiring manual RAHT for preprocessing. We also introduce the predictive RAHT to reduce bitrates and design a learning-based prediction model to enhance performance. Moreover, we devise a bitrate proxy that applies run-length coding to entropy model, achieving seamless variable-rate coding and improving robustness. DeepRAHT is a reversible and distortion-controllable framework, ensuring its lower bound performance and offering significant application potential. The experiments demonstrate that DeepRAHT is a high-performance, faster, and more robust solution than the baseline methods. Project Page: this https URL.

Title: DALD-PCAC: Density-Adaptive Learning Descriptor for Point Cloud Lossless Attribute Compression
Authors: Chunyang Fu, Ge Li, Wei Gao, Shiqi Wang, Zhu Li, Shan Liu
Abstract: Recently, deep learning has significantly advanced the performance of point cloud geometry compression. However, the learning-based lossless attribute compression of point clouds with varying densities is under-explored. In this paper, we develop a learning-based framework, namely DALD-PCAC that leverages Levels of Detail (LoD) to tailor for point cloud lossless attribute compression. We develop a point-wise attention model using a permutation-invariant Transformer to tackle the challenges of sparsity and irregularity of point clouds during context modeling. We also propose a Density-Adaptive Learning Descriptor (DALD) capable of capturing structure and correlations among points across a large range of neighbors. In addition, we develop a prior-guided block partitioning to reduce the attribute variance within blocks and enhance the performance. Experiments on LiDAR and object point clouds show that DALD-PCAC achieves the state-of-the-art performance on most data. Our method boosts the compression performance and is robust to the varying densities of point clouds. Moreover, it guarantees a good trade-off between performance and complexity, exhibiting great potential in real-world applications. The source code is available at this https URL.

Title: Low-Complexity RSS-based Underwater Localization with Unknown Transmit Power
Authors: Yingquan Li, Jiajie Xu, Bodhibrata Mukhopadhyay, Mohamed-Slim Alouini
Abstract: Underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) have received significant attention due to their various applications, with underwater target localization playing a vital role in enhancing network performance. Given the challenges and high costs associated with UWSN deployments, Received Signal Strength (RSS)-based localization offers a viable solution due to its minimal hardware requirements and cost-effectiveness. In this paper, we assign distance-based weights to RSS measurements, providing higher reliability to closer anchor nodes. Using the weighted RSS measurements and generalized trust region subproblem (GTRS), we propose the GTRS-based localization technique with Unknown Transmit Power (GUTP), which can be solved by a simple bisection method. Unlike conventional localization methods that require prior knowledge of the target node's transmit power, GUTP jointly estimates both the location and transmit power of the target node, broadening its practical use. Additionally, we derive the Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for RSS-based underwater localization with known and unknown transmit power, respectively. Extensive simulations demonstrate that GUTP achieves enhanced accuracy and significantly lower computational complexity in estimating the target node's location and transmit power compared to existing semidefinite programming (SDP)-based techniques.

Title: Overcoming BS Down-Tilt for Air-Ground ISAC Coverage: Antenna Design, Beamforming and User Scheduling
Authors: Lingyi Zhu, Zhongxiang Wei, Fan Liu, Jianjun Wu, Xiao-Wei Tang, Christos Masouros, Shanpu Shen
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication holds great promise for low-altitude economy applications. However, conventional downtilted base stations primarily provide sectorized forward lobes for ground services, failing to sense air targets due to backward blind zones. In this paper, a novel antenna structure is proposed to enable air-ground beam steering, facilitating simultaneous full-space sensing and communication (S&C). Specifically, instead of inserting a reflector behind the antenna array for backlobe mitigation, an omni-steering plate is introduced to collaborate with the active array for omnidirectional beamforming. Building on this hardware innovation, sum S&C mutual information (MI) is maximized, jointly optimizing user scheduling, passive coefficients of the omni-steering plate, and beamforming of the active array. The problem is decomposed into two subproblems: one for optimizing passive coefficients via Riemannian gradient on the manifold, and the other for optimizing user scheduling and active array beamforming. Exploiting relationships among S&C MI, data decoding MMSE, and parameter estimation MMSE, the original subproblem is equivalently transformed into a sum weighted MMSE problem, rigorously established via the Lagrangian and first-order optimality conditions. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm outperforms baselines in sum-MI and MSE, while providing 360 sensing coverage. Beampattern analysis further demonstrates effective user scheduling and accurate target alignment.

Title: Synthetic Volumetric Data Generation Enables Zero-Shot Generalization of Foundation Models in 3D Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Satrajit Chakrabarty, Sourya Sengupta, Gopal Avinash, Ravi Soni
Abstract: Foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) exhibit strong generalization on natural images and videos but perform poorly on medical data due to differences in appearance statistics, imaging physics, and three-dimensional structure. To address this gap, we introduce SynthFM-3D, an analytical framework that mathematically models 3D variability in anatomy, contrast, boundary definition, and noise to generate synthetic data for training promptable segmentation models without real annotations. We fine-tuned SAM 2 on 10,000 SynthFM-3D volumes and evaluated it on eleven anatomical structures across three medical imaging modalities (CT, MR, ultrasound) from five public datasets. SynthFM-3D training led to consistent and statistically significant Dice score improvements over the pretrained SAM 2 baseline, demonstrating stronger zero-shot generalization across modalities. When compared with the supervised SAM-Med3D model on unseen cardiac ultrasound data, SynthFM-3D achieved 2-3x higher Dice scores, establishing analytical 3D data modeling as an effective pathway to modality-agnostic medical segmentation.

Title: Worst-case Nonlinear Regression with Error Bounds
Authors: Alberto Bemporad
Abstract: This paper proposes an active-learning approach to worst-case nonlinear regression with deterministic error guarantees. Given a known nonlinear function defined over a compact set, we compute a surrogate model, such as a feedforward neural network, by minimizing the maximum absolute approximation error. To address the nonsmooth nature of the resulting minimax problem, we introduce a smooth approximation of the $L_\infty$-type loss that enables efficient gradient-based training. We iteratively enrich the training set by actively learning points of largest approximation error through global optimization. The resulting models admit certified worst-case error bounds, either constant or input-dependent, over the entire input domain. The approach is demonstrated through approximations of nonlinear functions and nonconvex sets, as well as through the derivation of uncertain models of more complex nonlinear dynamics within a given model class, and the approximation of explicit model predictive control laws.

Title: Adaptive Rotary Steering with Joint Autoregression for Robust Extraction of Closely Moving Speakers in Dynamic Scenarios
Authors: Jakob Kienegger, Timo Gerkmann
Abstract: Latest advances in deep spatial filtering for Ambisonics demonstrate strong performance in stationary multi-speaker scenarios by rotating the sound field toward a target speaker prior to multi-channel enhancement. For applicability in dynamic acoustic conditions with moving speakers, we propose to automate this rotary steering using an interleaved tracking algorithm conditioned on the target's initial direction. However, for nearby or crossing speakers, robust tracking becomes difficult and spatial cues less effective for enhancement. By incorporating the processed recording as additional guide into both algorithms, our novel joint autoregressive framework leverages temporal-spectral correlations of speech to resolve spatially challenging speaker constellations. Consequently, our proposed method significantly improves tracking and enhancement of closely spaced speakers, consistently outperforming comparable non-autoregressive methods on a synthetic dataset. Real-world recordings complement these findings in complex scenarios with multiple speaker crossings and varying speaker-to-array distances.

Title: Bone-conduction Guided Multimodal Speech Enhancement with Conditional Diffusion Models
Authors: Sina Khanagha, Bunlong Lay, Timo Gerkmann
Abstract: Single-channel speech enhancement models face significant performance degradation in extremely noisy environments. While prior work has shown that complementary bone-conducted speech can guide enhancement, effective integration of this noise-immune modality remains a challenge. This paper introduces a novel multimodal speech enhancement framework that integrates bone-conduction sensors with air-conducted microphones using a conditional diffusion model. Our proposed model significantly outperforms previously established multimodal techniques and a powerful diffusion-based single-modal baseline across a wide range of acoustic conditions.

Title: RIS-Enhanced Information-Decoupled Symbiotic Radio Over Broadcasting Signals
Authors: Shu Cai, Ya-Feng Liu, Jun Zhan, Qi Zhang
Abstract: This paper studies a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-enhanced decoupled symbiotic radio (SR) system in which a primary transmitter delivers common data to multiple primary receivers (PRs), while a RIS-based backscatter device sends secondary data to a backscatter receiver (BRx). Unlike conventional SR, the BRx performs energy detection and never decodes the primary signal, thereby removing ambiguity and preventing exposure of the primary payload to unintended receivers. In this paper, we formulate the problem as the minimization of the transmit power subject to a common broadcast rate constraint across all PRs and a bit error rate (BER) constraint at the BRx. The problem is nonconvex due to the unit-modulus RIS constraint and coupled quadratic forms. Leveraging a rate-balanced reformulation and a monotonic BER ratio characterization, we develop a low-complexity penalty-based block coordinate descent algorithm with closed-form updates. Numerical results show fast convergence of the proposed algorithm and reduced power consumption of the considered RIS-enhanced information-decoupled SR system over conventional SR baselines.

Title: Temporal Data and Short-Time Averages Improve Multiphase Mass Flow Metering
Authors: Amanda Nyholm, Yessica Arellano, Jinyu Liu, Damian Krakowiak, Pierluigi Salvo Rossi
Abstract: Reliable flow measurements are essential in many industries, but current instruments often fail to accurately estimate multiphase flows, which are frequently encountered in real-world operations. Combining machine learning (ML) algorithms with accurate single-phase flowmeters has therefore received extensive research attention in recent years. The Coriolis mass flowmeter is a widely used single-phase meter that provides direct mass flow measurements, which ML models can be trained to correct, thereby reducing measurement errors in multiphase conditions. This paper demonstrates that preserving temporal information significantly improves model performance in such scenarios. We compare a multilayer perceptron, a windowed multilayer perceptron, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) on three-phase air-water-oil flow data from 342 experiments. Whereas prior work typically compresses each experiment into a single averaged sample, we instead compute short-time averages from within each experiment and train models that preserve temporal information at several downsampling intervals. The CNN performed best at 0.25 Hz with approximately 95 % of relative errors below 13 %, a normalized root mean squared error of 0.03, and a mean absolute percentage error of approximately 4.3 %, clearly outperforming the best single-averaged model and demonstrating that short-time averaging within individual experiments is preferable. Results are consistent across multiple data splits and random seeds, demonstrating robustness.

Title: Purification Before Fusion: Toward Mask-Free Speech Enhancement for Robust Audio-Visual Speech Recognition
Authors: Linzhi Wu, Xingyu Zhang, Hao Yuan, Yakun Zhang, Changyan Zheng, Liang Xie, Tiejun Liu, Erwei Yin
Abstract: Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) typically improves recognition accuracy in noisy environments by integrating noise-immune visual cues with audio signals. Nevertheless, high-noise audio inputs are prone to introducing adverse interference into the feature fusion process. To mitigate this, recent AVSR methods often adopt mask-based strategies to filter audio noise during feature interaction and fusion, yet such methods risk discarding semantically relevant information alongside noise. In this work, we propose an end-to-end noise-robust AVSR framework coupled with speech enhancement, eliminating the need for explicit noise mask generation. This framework leverages a Conformer-based bottleneck fusion module to implicitly refine noisy audio features with video assistance. By reducing modality redundancy and enhancing inter-modal interactions, our method preserves speech semantic integrity to achieve robust recognition performance. Experimental evaluations on the public LRS3 benchmark suggest that our method outperforms prior advanced mask-based baselines under noisy conditions.

Title: The Effect of Noise Correlation on MMSE Channel Estimation in One-Bit Quantized Systems
Authors: Minhua Ding, Prathapasinghe Dharmawansa, Italo Atzeni, Antti Tölli
Abstract: This paper analyzes the impact of spatially correlated additive noise on the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimation of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels from one-bit quantized observations. Although additive noise can be correlated in practical scenarios, e.g., due to jamming, clutter, or other external disturbances, the effect of such correlation on the MMSE channel estimator in this setting remains unexplored in prior work. Against this backdrop, we derive a novel analytical expression for the general MIMO MMSE channel estimator, which is inherently nonlinear in one-bit observations, and accommodates arbitrary channel and noise correlation structures. To further characterize the impact of noise correlation, we subsequently specialize the general MMSE expression to certain tractable multi antenna configurations in which both the channel and the noise assume single-parameter constant correlation structures. Our analyses reveal nontrivial, noise-correlation-induced scenarios in which the estimator remains linear despite non-zero channel and noise correlation parameters. Moreover, the results indicate that, at low-to-medium signal-to-noise ratio, noise correlation improves the MMSE performance when channels are uncorrelated, but degrades performance when channels are strongly correlated.

Title: Robust Online Overdetermined Independent Vector Analysis Based on Bilinear Decomposition
Authors: Kang Chen, Xianrui Wang, Yichen Yang, Andreas Brendel, Gongping Huang, Zbyněk Koldovský, Jingdong Chen, Jacob Benesty, Shoji Makino
Abstract: Online blind source separation is essential for both speech communication and human-machine interaction. Among existing approaches, overdetermined independent vector analysis (OverIVA) delivers strong performance by exploiting the statistical independence of source signals and the orthogonality between source and noise subspaces. However, when applied to large microphone arrays, the number of parameters grows rapidly, which can degrade online estimation accuracy. To overcome this challenge, we propose decomposing each long separation filter into a bilinear form of two shorter filters, thereby reducing the number of parameters. Because the two filters are closely coupled, we design an alternating iterative projection algorithm to update them in turn. Simulation results show that, with far fewer parameters, the proposed method achieves improved performance and robustness.

Title: Deep Lightweight Unrolled Network for High Dynamic Range Modulo Imaging
Authors: Brayan Monroy, Jorge Bacca
Abstract: Modulo-Imaging (MI) offers a promising alternative for expanding the dynamic range of images by resetting the signal intensity when it reaches the saturation level. Subsequently, high-dynamic range (HDR) modulo imaging requires a recovery process to obtain the HDR image. MI is a non-convex and ill-posed problem where recent recovery networks suffer in high-noise scenarios. In this work, we formulate the HDR reconstruction task as an optimization problem that incorporates a deep prior and subsequently unrolls it into an optimization-inspired deep neural network. The network employs a lightweight convolutional denoiser for fast inference with minimal computational overhead, effectively recovering intensity values while mitigating noise. Moreover, we introduce the Scaling Equivariance term that facilitates self-supervised fine-tuning, thereby enabling the model to adapt to new modulo images that fall outside the original training distribution. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-art recovery algorithms in terms of performance and quality.

Title: Automated Angular Received-Power Characterization of Embedded mmWave Transmitters Using Geometry-Calibrated Spatial Sampling
Authors: Maaz Qureshi, Mohammad Omid Bagheri, Abdelrahman Elbadrawy, William Melek, George Shaker
Abstract: This paper presents an automated measurement methodology for angular received-power characterization of embedded millimeter-wave transmitters using geometry-calibrated spatial sampling. Characterization of integrated mmWave transmitters remains challenging due to limited angular coverage and alignment variability in conventional probe-station techniques, as well as the impracticality of anechoic-chamber testing for platform-mounted active modules. To address these challenges, we introduce RAPTAR, an autonomous measurement system for angular received-power acquisition under realistic installation constraints. A collaborative robot executes geometry-calibrated, collision-aware hemispherical trajectories while carrying a calibrated receive probe, enabling controlled and repeatable spatial positioning around a fixed device under test. A spectrum-analyzer-based receiver chain acquires amplitude-only received power as a function of angle and distance following quasi-static pose stabilization. The proposed framework enables repeatable angular received-power mapping and power-domain comparison against idealized free-space references derived from full-wave simulation. Experimental results for a 60-GHz radar module demonstrate a mean absolute received-power error below 2 dB relative to simulation-derived references and a 36.5 % reduction in error compared to manual probe-station measurements, attributed primarily to reduced alignment variability and consistent spatial sampling. The proposed method eliminates the need for coherent field measurements and near-field transformations, enabling practical power-domain characterization of embedded mmWave modules. It is well suited for angular validation in real-world platforms where conventional anechoic measurements are impractical.

Title: SLAP: Scalable Language-Audio Pretraining with Variable-Duration Audio and Multi-Objective Training
Authors: Xinhao Mei, Gael Le Lan, Haohe Liu, Zhaoheng Ni, Varun Nagaraja, Yang Liu, Yangyang Shi, Vikas Chandra
Abstract: Contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) has achieved notable success in learning semantically rich audio representations and is widely adopted for various audio-related tasks. However, current CLAP models face several key limitations. First, they are typically trained on relatively small datasets, often comprising a few million audio samples. Second, existing CLAP models are restricted to short and fixed duration, which constrains their usage in real-world scenarios with variable-duration audio. Third, the standard contrastive training objective operates on global representations, which may hinder the learning of dense, fine-grained audio features. To address these challenges, we introduce Scalable Language-Audio Pretraining (SLAP), which scales language-audio pretraining to 109 million audio-text pairs with variable audio durations and incorporates multiple training objectives. SLAP unifies contrastive loss with additional self-supervised and captioning losses in a single-stage training, facilitating the learning of richer dense audio representations. The proposed SLAP model achieves new state-of-the-art performance on audio-text retrieval and zero-shot audio classification tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks.

Title: HERMES: A Unified Open-Source Framework for Realtime Multimodal Physiological Sensing, Edge AI, and Intervention in Closed-Loop Smart Healthcare Applications
Authors: Maxim Yudayev, Juha Carlon, Diwas Lamsal, Vayalet Stefanova, Benjamin Filtjens
Abstract: Intelligent assistive technologies are increasingly recognized as critical daily-use enablers for people with disabilities and age-related functional decline. Longitudinal studies, curation of quality datasets, live monitoring in activities of daily living, and intelligent intervention devices, share the largely unsolved need in reliable high-throughput multimodal sensing and processing. Streaming large heterogeneous data from distributed sensors, historically closed-source environments, and limited prior works on realtime closed-loop AI methodologies, inhibit such applications. To accelerate the emergence of clinical deployments, we deliver HERMES - an open-source high-performance Python framework for continuous multimodal sensing and AI processing at the edge. It enables synchronized data collection, and realtime streaming inference with user PyTorch models, on commodity computing devices. HERMES is applicable to fixed-lab and free-living environments, of distributed commercial and custom sensors. It is the first work to offer a holistic methodology that bridges cross-disciplinary gaps in real-world implementation strategies, and guides downstream AI model development. Its application on the closed-loop intelligent prosthesis use case illustrates the process of suitable AI model development from the generated constraints and trade-offs. Validation on the use case, with 4 synchronized hosts cooperatively capturing 18 wearable and off-body modalities, demonstrates performance and relevance of HERMES to the trajectory of the intelligent healthcare domain.

Title: Allocating Corrective Control to Mitigate Multi-agent Safety Violations Under Private Preferences
Authors: Johnathan Corbin, Sarah H.Q. Li, Jonathan Rogers
Abstract: We propose a novel framework that computes the corrective control efforts to ensure joint safety in multi-agent dynamical systems. This framework efficiently distributes the required corrective effort without revealing individual agents' private preferences. Our framework integrates high-order control barrier functions (HOCBFs), which enforce safety constraints with formal guarantees of safety for complex dynamical systems, with a privacy-preserving resource allocation mechanism based on the progressive second price (PSP) auction. When a joint safety constraint is violated, agents iteratively bid on new corrective efforts via 'avoidance credits' rather than explicitly solving for feasible corrective efforts that remove the safety violation. The resulting correction, determined via a second price payment rule, coincides with the socially optimal safe distribution of corrective actions. Critically, the bidding process achieves this optimal allocation efficiently and without revealing private preferences of individual agents. We demonstrate this method through multi-robot hardware experiments on the Robotarium platform.

Abstract: Connectivity in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) introduces vulnerability to cyber threats such as false data injection (FDI) attacks, which can compromise system reliability and safety. To ensure resilience, this paper proposes a control framework combining a nonlinear controller with an interval observer for robust state estimation under measurement noise. The observer bounds leader's states, while a neural network-based estimator estimates the unknown FDI attacks in real time. These estimates are then used to mitigate FDI attack effects maintaining safe inter-vehicle spacing. The proposed approach leverages an idea of interval observer-based estimation and merges model-based and learning-based methods to achieve accurate estimations and real-time performance. MATLAB/Simulink results confirm resilient tracking, precise FDI attack estimation, and robustness to noise, demonstrating potential for real-world CACC applications under cyberattacks, disturbance, and bounded measurement noise.

Title: Millimeter-Wave Multi-Radar Tracking System Enabled by a Modified GRIN Luneburg Lens for Real-Time Healthcare Monitoring
Authors: Mohammad Omid Bagheri, Justin Chow, Josh Visser, Veronica Leong, George Shaker
Abstract: Multi-beam radar sensing systems are emerging as powerful tools for non-contact motion tracking and vital-sign monitoring in healthcare environments. This paper presents the design and experimental validation of a synchronized millimeter-wave multi-radar tracking system enhanced by a modified spherical gradient-index (GRIN) Luneburg lens. Five commercial FMCW radar modules operating in the 58--63 GHz band are arranged in a semi-circular configuration around the lens, whose tailored refractive-index profile accommodates bistatic radar modules with co-located transmit (TX) and receive (RX) antennas. The resulting architecture generates multiple fixed high-gain beams with improved angular resolution and minimal mutual interference. Each radar operates independently but is temporally synchronized through a centralized Python-based acquisition framework to enable parallel data collection and low-latency motion tracking. A 10-cm-diameter 3D-printed prototype demonstrates a measured gain enhancement of approximately 12 dB for each module, corresponding to a substantial improvement in detection range. Full-wave simulations and measurements confirm effective non-contact, privacy-preserving short-range human-motion detection across five 28-degree sectors, providing 140-degree total angular coverage. Fall-detection experiments further validate reliable wide-angle performance and continuous spatial tracking. The proposed system offers a compact, low-cost, and scalable platform for millimeter-wave sensing in ambient healthcare and smart-environment applications.

Title: Multiagent Reinforcement Learning in Enhancing Resilience of Microgrids under Extreme Weather Events
Authors: Yin Wu, Wei-Yu Chiu, Yuan-Po Tsai, Shangyuan Liu, Weiqi Hua
Abstract: Grid resilience is crucial in light of power interruptions caused by increasingly frequent extreme weather events. Well-designed energy management systems (EMS) have made progress in improving microgrid resilience through the coordination of distributed energy resources (DERs), but still face significant challenges in addressing the uncertainty of load demand caused by extreme weather. The integration of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) into EMS design enables optimized microgrid control strategies for coordinating DERs. Building on this, we proposed a cooperative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)-based EMS framework to provide flexible scalability for microgrids, enhance resilience and reduce operational costs during power outages. Specifically, the gated recurrent unit with a gating mechanism was introduced to extract features from temporal data, which enables the EMS to coordinate DERs more efficiently. Next, the proposed MADRL method incorporating action masking techniques was evaluated in the IEEE 33-Bus system using real-world data on renewable generation and power load. Finally, the numerical results demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method in reducing operating costs as well as the effectiveness in enhancing microgrid resilience during power interruptions.

Title: Two-Layer Reinforcement Learning-Assisted Joint Beamforming and Trajectory Optimization for Multi-UAV Downlink Communications
Authors: Ruiqi Wang, Essra M.Ghoura, Omar Alhussein, Yuzhi Yang, Yuhang Sheng, Jing Ren, Shizhong Xu, Sami Muhaidat
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are pivotal for future 6G non-terrestrial networks, yet their high mobility creates a complex coupled optimization problem for beamforming and trajectory design. Existing numerical methods suffer from prohibitive latency, while standard deep learning often ignores dynamic interference topology, limiting scalability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a hierarchically decoupled framework synergizing graph neural networks (GNNs) with multi-agent reinforcement learning. Specifically, on the short timescale, we develop a topology-aware GNN beamformer by incorporating GraphNorm. By modeling the dynamic UAV-user association as a time-varying heterogeneous graph, this method explicitly extracts interference patterns to achieve sub-millisecond inference. On the long timescale, trajectory planning is modeled as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process and solved via the multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm under the centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm, facilitating cooperative behaviors. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art optimization heuristics and deep learning baselines in terms of system sum rate, convergence speed, and generalization capability.

Title: Energy-Efficient Prediction in Textile Manufacturing: Enhancing Accuracy and Data Efficiency With Ensemble Deep Transfer Learning
Authors: Yan-Chen Chen, Wei-Yu Chiu, Qun-Yu Wang, Jing-Wei Chen, Hao-Ting Zhao
Abstract: Traditional textile factories consume substantial energy, making energy-efficient production optimization crucial for sustainability and cost reduction. Meanwhile, deep neural networks (DNNs), which are effective for factory output prediction and operational optimization, require extensive historical data, posing challenges due to high sensor deployment and data collection costs. To address this, we propose Ensemble Deep Transfer Learning (EDTL), a novel framework that enhances prediction accuracy and data efficiency by integrating transfer learning with an ensemble strategy and a feature alignment layer. EDTL pretrains DNN models on data-rich production lines (source domain) and adapts them to data-limited lines (target domain), reducing dependency on large datasets. Experiments on real-world textile factory datasets show that EDTL improves prediction accuracy by 5.66% and enhances model robustness by 3.96% compared to conventional DNNs, particularly in data-limited scenarios (20%-40% data availability). This research contributes to energy-efficient textile manufacturing by enabling accurate predictions with fewer data requirements, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for smart production systems.

Title: Network Slicing Resource Management in Uplink User-Centric Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems
Authors: Manobendu Sarker, Soumaya Cherkaoui
Abstract: This paper addresses the joint optimization of per-user equipment (UE) bandwidth allocation and UE-access point (AP) association to maximize weighted sum-rate while satisfying heterogeneous quality-of-service (QoS) requirements across enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) slices in the uplink of a network slicing-enabled user-centric cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system. The formulated problem is NP-hard, rendering global optimality computationally intractable. To address this challenge, it is decomposed into two sub-problems, each solved by a computationally efficient heuristic scheme, and jointly optimized through an alternating optimization framework. We then propose (i) a bandwidth allocation scheme that balances UE priority, spectral efficiency, and minimum bandwidth demand under limited resources to ensure fair QoS distribution, and (ii) a priority-based UE-AP association assignment approach that balances UE service quality with system capacity constraints. Together, these approaches provide a practical and computationally efficient solution for resource-constrained network slicing scenarios, where QoS feasibility is often violated under dense deployments and limited bandwidth, necessitating graceful degradation and fair QoS preservation rather than solely maximizing the aggregate sum-rate. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves up to 52% higher weighted sum-rate, 140% and 58% higher QoS success rates for eMBB and URLLC slices, respectively, while reducing runtime by up to 97% compared to considered benchmarks.

Title: Priority-Based Bandwidth Allocation in Network Slicing-Enabled Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems
Authors: Manobendu Sarker, Soumaya Cherkaoui
Abstract: This paper addresses joint admission control and per-user equipment (UE) bandwidth allocation to maximize weighted sum-rate in network slicing-enabled user-centric cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems when aggregate quality-of-service (QoS) demand may exceed available bandwidth. Specifically, we optimize bandwidth allocation while satisfying heterogeneous QoS requirements across enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) slices in the uplink. The formulated problem is NP-hard, rendering global optimality computationally intractable. We decompose it into two sub-problems and solve them via computationally efficient heuristics within a sequential framework. We propose (i) a hierarchical admission control scheme that selectively admits UEs under bandwidth scarcity, prioritizing URLLC to ensure latency-sensitive QoS compliance, and (ii) an iterative gradient-based bandwidth allocation scheme that transfers bandwidth across slices guided by marginal utility and reallocates resources within slices. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves near-optimal performance, deviating from a CVX-based benchmark by at most 2.2% in weighted sum-rate while reducing runtime by 99.7%, thereby enabling practical real-time deployment. Compared to a baseline round-robin scheme without admission control, the proposed approach achieves up to 1085% and 7% higher success rates for eMBB and URLLC slices, respectively, by intentionally sacrificing sum-rate to guarantee QoS. Sensitivity analysis further reveals that the proposed solution adapts effectively to diverse eMBB/URLLC traffic compositions, maintaining 47-51% eMBB and 93-94% URLLC success rates across varying load scenarios, confirming its robustness for resource-constrained large-scale deployments.

Title: Closed-loop Uplink Radio Resource Management in CF-O-RAN Empowered 5G Aerial Corridor
Authors: Manobendu Sarker, Md. Zoheb Hassan, Xianbin Wang
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the uplink (UL) radio resource management for 5G aerial corridors with an open-radio access network (O-RAN)-enabled cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system. Our objective is to maximize the minimum spectral efficiency (SE) by jointly optimizing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-open radio unit (O-RU) association and UL transmit power under quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. Owing to its NP-hard nature, the formulated problem is decomposed into two tractable sub-problems solved via alternating optimization (AO) using two computationally efficient algorithms. We then propose (i) a QoS-driven and multi-connectivity-enabled association algorithm incorporating UAV-centric and O-RU-centric criteria with targeted refinement for weak UAVs, and (ii) a bisection-guided fixed-point power control algorithm achieving global optimality with significantly reduced complexity, hosted as xApp at the near-real-time (near-RT) RAN intelligent controller (RIC) of O-RAN. Solving the resource-allocation problem requires global channel state information (CSI), which incurs substantial measurement and signaling overhead. To mitigate this, we leverage a channel knowledge map (CKM) within the O-RAN non-RT RIC to enable efficient environment-aware CSI inference. Simulation results show that the proposed framework achieves up to 440% improvement in minimum SE, 100% QoS satisfaction and fairness, while reducing runtime by up to 99.7% compared to an interior point solver-based power allocation solution, thereby enabling O-RAN compliant real-time deployment.

Title: From Noise to Knowledge: System Identification with Systematic Polytope Construction via Cyclic Reformulation
Authors: Hiroshi Okajima, Shun Shirahama, Tatsunori Hayashi, Nobutomo Matsunaga
Abstract: Model-based control requires accurate mathematical models to guarantee control performance and stability. However, obtaining accurate models is challenging due to process and sensor noise. This paper proposes a novel identification algorithm that derives polytopic uncertainty models by interpreting noise-induced parameter fluctuations as intrinsic uncertainty. The method applies cyclic reformulation with period N to linear time-invariant systems, yielding N parameter sets with slight variations that serve as polytope vertices. This enables systematic polytopic model construction from a single identification experiment. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements: the proposed method achieves higher parameter estimation accuracy and reduces prediction errors by approximately half compared to conventional approaches. The vertex count N provides systematic control over the precision of uncertainty representation.

Title: Improving Audio Question Answering with Variational Inference
Authors: Haolin Chen
Abstract: Variational inference (VI) provides a principled framework for estimating posterior distributions over model parameters, enabling explicit modeling of weight uncertainty during optimization. By capturing this uncertainty, VI improves the reliability of predictions, yielding better calibrated outputs. In this work, we investigate the benefits of VI for challenging multimodal understanding and reasoning by applying the Improved Variational Online Newton (IVON), a recent VI optimizer, to fine-tuning a multimodal large language model on audio question answering tasks. Our results show that VI not only enhances predictive accuracy but also significantly improves calibration, reducing the model's overconfidence. These advances further support risk-sensitive applications such as selective prediction, where reliable confidence estimates are crucial.

Title: Energy-Based Cell Association in Nonuniform Renewable Energy-Powered Cellular Networks: Analysis and Optimization of Carbon Efficiency
Authors: Yuxi Zhao, Vicente Casares-Giner, Vicent Pla, Luis Guijarro, Iztok Humar, Yi Zhong, Xiaohu Ge
Abstract: The increasing global push for carbon reduction highlights the importance of integrating renewable energy into the supply chain of cellular networks. However, due to the stochastic nature of renewable energy generation and the uneven load distribution across base stations, the utilization rate of renewable energy remains low. To address these challenges, this paper investigates the trade-off between carbon emissions and downlink throughput in cellular networks, offering insights into optimizing both network performance and sustainability. The renewable energy state of base station batteries and the number of occupied channels are modeled as a quasi-birth-death process. We construct models for the probability of channel blocking, average successful transmission probability for users, downlink throughput, carbon emissions, and carbon efficiency based on stochastic geometry. Based on these analyses, an energy-based cell association scheme is proposed to optimize the carbon efficiency of cellular networks. The results show that, compared to the closest cell association scheme, the energy-based cell association scheme is capable of reducing the carbon emissions of the network by 13.0% and improving the carbon efficiency by 11.3%.

Title: Robust Beamforming and Time Allocation for Time-Division Cell-Free Near-Field ISAC
Authors: Chaedam Son, Si-Hyeon Lee
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a time-division near-field integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework for cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), where sensing and downlink communication are separated in time. During the sensing phase, user locations are estimated and used to construct location-aware channels, which are then exploited in the subsequent communication phase. By explicitly modeling the coupling between sensing-induced localization errors and channel-estimation errors, we capture the tradeoff between sensing accuracy and communication throughput. Based on this model, we jointly optimize the time-allocation ratio, sensing covariance matrix, and robust downlink beamforming under imperfect channel state information (CSI). The resulting non-convex problem is addressed via a semidefinite programming (SDP)-based reformulation within an alternating-optimization framework. To further reduce computational complexity, we also propose two low-complexity suboptimal designs: an error-ignorant scheme and a maximum ratio transmission (MRT)-based scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves localization accuracy over far-field and monostatic setups, thereby reducing channel estimation errors and ultimately enhancing the achievable rate. Moreover, the error-ignorant scheme performs well under stringent sensing requirements, whereas the MRT-based scheme remains robust over a wide range of sensing requirements by adapting the time-allocation ratio, albeit with some beamforming loss.

Title: CodeSep: Low-Bitrate Codec-Driven Speech Separation with Base-Token Disentanglement and Auxiliary-Token Serial Prediction
Authors: Hui-Peng Du, Yang Ai, Xiao-Hang Jiang, Rui-Chen Zheng, Zhen-Hua Ling
Abstract: This paper targets a new scenario that integrates speech separation with speech compression, aiming to disentangle multiple speakers while producing discrete representations for efficient transmission or storage, with applications in online meetings and dialogue archiving. To address this scenario, we propose CodeSep, a codec-driven model that jointly performs speech separation and low-bitrate compression. CodeSep comprises a residual vector quantizer (RVQ)-based plain neural speech codec, a base-token disentanglement (BTD) module, and parallel auxiliary-token serial prediction (ATSP) modules. The BTD module disentangles mixed-speech mel-spectrograms into base tokens for each speaker, which are then refined by ATSP modules to serially predict auxiliary tokens, and finally, all tokens are decoded to reconstruct separated waveforms through the codec decoder. During training, the codec's RVQ provides supervision with permutation-invariant and teacher-forcing-based cross-entropy losses. As only base tokens are transmitted or stored, CodeSep achieves low-bitrate compression. Experimental results show that CodeSep attains satisfactory separation performance at only 1 kbps compared with baseline methods.

Title: Adaptive Speaker Embedding Self-Augmentation for Personal Voice Activity Detection with Short Enrollment Speech
Authors: Fuyuan Feng, Wenbin Zhang, Yu Gao, Longting Xu, Xiaofeng Mou, Yi Xu
Abstract: Personal Voice Activity Detection (PVAD) is crucial for identifying target speaker segments in the mixture, yet its performance heavily depends on the quality of speaker embeddings. A key practical limitation is the short enrollment speech--such as a wake-up word--which provides limited cues. This paper proposes a novel adaptive speaker embedding self-augmentation strategy that enhances PVAD performance by augmenting the original enrollment embeddings through additive fusion of keyframe embeddings extracted from mixed speech. Furthermore, we introduce a long-term adaptation strategy to iteratively refine embeddings during detection, mitigating speaker temporal variability. Experiments show significant gains in recall, precision, and F1-score under short enrollment conditions, matching full-length enrollment performance after five iterative updates.

Title: Sensing-Limited Control of Noiseless Linear Systems Under Nonlinear Observations
Authors: Ming Li, Fan Liu, Yifeng Xiong, Jie Xu, Tao Liu
Abstract: This paper investigates the fundamental information-theoretic limits for the control and sensing of noiseless linear dynamical systems subject to a broad class of nonlinear observations. We analyze the interactions between the control and sensing components by characterizing the minimum information flow required for stability. Specifically, we derive necessary conditions for mean-square observability and stabilizability, demonstrating that the average directed information rate from the state to the observations must exceed the intrinsic expansion rate of the unstable dynamics. Furthermore, to address the challenges posed by non-Gaussian distributions inherent to nonlinear observation channels, we establish sufficient conditions by imposing regularity assumptions, specifically log-concavity, on the system's probabilistic components. We show that under these conditions, the divergence of differential entropy implies the convergence of the estimation error, thereby closing the gap between information-theoretic bounds and estimation performance. By establishing these results, we unveil the fundamental performance limits imposed by the sensing layer, extending classical data-rate constraints to the more challenging regime of nonlinear observation models.

Title: Movable Antenna Enhanced MIMO Communications with Spatial Modulation
Authors: Kaihe Wang, Ran Yang, Lipeng Zhu, Rongyan Xi, Yue Xiu, Zhongpei Zhang
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) has demonstrated great potential in enhancing wireless communication performance. In this paper, we investigate an MA-enabled multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system with spatial modulation (SM), which improves communication performance by utilizing flexible MA placement while reducing the cost of RF chains. To this end, we propose a joint transceiver design framework aimed at minimizing the bit error rate (BER) based on the maximum minimum distance (MMD) criterion. To address the intractable problem, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm based on alternating optimization (AO) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves rapid convergence performance and significantly outperforms the existing benchmark schemes.

Title: Integrated Sensing and Semantic Communication with Adaptive Source-Channel Coding
Authors: Haotian Wang, Dan Wang, Xiaodong Xu, Chuan Huang, Hao Chen, Nan Ma
Abstract: Semantic communication has emerged as a new paradigm to facilitate the performance of integrated sensing and communication systems in 6G. However, most of the existing works mainly focus on sensing data compression to reduce the subsequent communication overheads, without considering the integrated transmission framework for both the SemCom and sensing tasks. This paper proposes an adaptive source-channel coding and beamforming design framework for integrated sensing and SemCom systems by jointly optimizing the coding rate for SemCom task and the transmit beamforming for both the SemCom and sensing tasks. Specifically, an end-to-end semantic distortion function is approximated by deriving an upper bound composing of source and channel coding induced components, and then a hybrid Cramér-Rao bound (HCRB) is also derived for target position under imperfect time synchronization. To facilitate the joint optimization, a distortion minimization problem is formulated by considering the HCRB threshold, channel uses, and power budget. Subsequently, an alternative optimization algorithm composed of successive convex approximation and fractional programming is proposed to address this problem by decoupling it into two subproblems for coding rate and beamforming designs, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms the conventional deep joint source-channel coding -water filling-zero forcing benchmark.

Title: Lessons Learned from Structural Design and Vibration Testing of 50-kg Microsatellites Deployed from the International Space Station
Authors: Yuji Sakamoto, Junichi Kurihara, Shinya Fujita, Yuji Sato, Toshinori Kuwahara
Abstract: Hokkaido University and Tohoku University have been developing and operating a constellation of 50-cm-class microsatellites for Earth observation. DIWATA-1, launched in 2016, was deployed into a circular orbit at an altitude of approximately 400 km from the International Space Station (ISS). For the subsequent satellite developed in 2021, the structural design and vibration test campaign were optimized to meet a strict one-year development schedule. This paper summarizes how the structural design of the previous satellite was reviewed and updated, and how the vibration test was successfully completed in a single trial to minimize schedule and technical risks. These lessons learned provide valuable insights, as there are only a limited number of reported cases of 50-kg-class microsatellites deployed from the ISS.

Title: Angular Sensing by Highly Reconfigurable Pixel Antennas with Joint Radiating Aperture and Feeding Ports Reconfiguration
Authors: Zixiang Han, Hanning Wang, Shiwen Tang, Yujie Zhang
Abstract: Angular sensing capability is realized using highly reconfigurable pixel antenna (HRPA) with joint radiating aperture and feeding ports reconfiguration. Pixel antennas represent a general class of reconfigurable antenna designs in which the radiating surface, regardless of its shape or size, is divided into sub-wavelength elements called pixels. Each pixel is connected to its neighboring elements through radio frequency switches. By controlling pixel connections, the pixel antenna topology can be flexibly adjusted so that the resulting radiation pattern can be reconfigured. However, conventional pixel antennas have only a single, fixed-position feeding port, which is not efficient for angular sensing. Therefore, in this work, we further extend the reconfigurability of pixel antennas by introducing the HRPA, which enables both geometry control of the pixel antenna and switching of its feeding ports. The model of the proposed HRPA, including both circuit and radiation parameters, is derived. A codebook is then defined, consisting of pixel connection states and feeding port positions for each sensing area. Based on this codebook, an efficient optimization approach is developed to minimize the Cram\acute{\mathrm{\mathbf{e}}}r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and obtain the optimal HRPA geometries for angular sensing within a given area. Numerical results show that the HRPA reduces the angle estimation error by more than 50% across the full three-dimensional sphere when compared with a conventional uniform planar array of the same size. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach and highlights the potential of HRPA for integrated sensing and communication systems.

Title: From Vertices to Convex Hulls: Certifying Set-Wise Compatibility for CBF Constraints
Authors: Shima Sadat Mousavi, Xiao Tan, Aaron D. Ames
Abstract: This paper develops certificates that propagate compatibility of multiple control barrier function (CBF) constraints from sampled vertices to their convex hull. Under mild concavity and affinity assumptions, we present three sufficient feasibility conditions under which feasible inputs over the convex hull can be obtained per coordinate, with a common input, or via convex blending. We also describe the associated computational methods, based on interval intersections or an offline linear program (LP). Beyond certifying compatibility, we give conditions under which the quadratic-program (QP) safety filter is affine in the state. This enables explicit implementations via convex combinations of vertex-feasible inputs. Case studies illustrate the results.

Title: Fluid Antenna Relay (FAR)-assisted Communication with Hybrid Relaying Scheme Selection
Authors: Ruopeng Xu, Songling Zhang, Zhaohui Yang, Mingzhe Chen, Zhaoyang Zhang, Kai-Kit Wong
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a fluid antenna relay (FAR)-assisted communication system with hybrid relaying scheme selection. By leveraging statistical channel state information (CSI) and distribution characteristics of fluid antenna system (FAS), we approximate the outage probability (OP) with different relaying schemes utilizing a Gaussian copula-based method. Each relay node follows the OP-minimized principle to choose the forwarding schemes. To reduce self-interference and avoid multi-user interference, half-duplex relays and frequency division multiple access schemes are considered, respectively. On this basis, we formulate a sum-rate maximization problem to mitigate the rate loss introduced by the half-duplex mode. To solve this problem, we first transform the original nonconvex problem into a power control optimization problem by obtaining the closed form of bandwidth allocation and substituting it into the original problem. Then, we solve the power control optimization problem with a low complexity method. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm to improve the sum rate of the system.

Authors: Joel Hirst, Lorna Sibson, Adel Tayeb, Ben Poole, Megan Sampson, Wiera Bielajewa, Michael Atkinson, Alex Marsh, Rory Spencer, Rob Hamill, Cory Hamelin, Allan Harte, Lloyd Fletcher
Abstract: Pyvale is an open-source software package that aims to become an all-in-one tool for sensor simulation, sensor uncertainty quantification, sensor placement optimization, and calibration/validation. Central to this is support for image-based sensors, with a dedicated Digital Image Correlation (DIC) module designed for both standalone use and integration within broader experimental design workflows. The design philosophy behind the DIC engine in Pyvale prioritizes a user-friendly Python interface with performant compiled code under the hood. This paper covers Pyvale's 2D DIC engine design, implementation, metrological performance compared to other DIC codes, and the unique ability to handle gigapixel size scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. Finally, we compare runtimes between Pyvale and other open-source DIC codes and show strong computational performance across a range of image resolutions and thread counts.

Title: ImmersiveFlow: Stereo-to-7.1.4 spatial audio generation with flow matching
Authors: Zining Liang, Runbang Wang, Xuzhou Ye, Qiuqiang Kong
Abstract: Immersive spatial audio has become increasingly critical for applications ranging from AR/VR to home entertainment and automotive sound systems. However, existing generative methods remain constrained to low-dimensional formats such as binaural audio and First-Order Ambisonics (FOA). Binaural rendering is inherently limited to headphone playback, while FOA suffers from spatial aliasing and insufficient resolution for high-frequency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ImmersiveFlow, the first end-to-end generative framework that directly synthesizes discrete 7.1.4 format spatial audio from stereo input. ImmersiveFlow leverages Flow Matching to learn trajectories from stereo inputs to multichannel spatial features within a pretrained VAE latent space. At inference, the Flow Matching model predicted latent features are decoded by the VAE and converted into the final 7.1.4 waveform. Comprehensive objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that our method produces perceptually rich sound fields and enhanced externalization, significantly outperforming traditional upmixing techniques. Code implementations and audio samples are provided at: this https URL.

Title: Monostatic ISAC Without Full Buffers: Revisiting Spatial Trade-Offs Under Bursty Traffic
Authors: Mauro Marchese, Musa Furkan Keskin, Pietro Savazzi, Henk Wymeersch
Abstract: This work investigates the spatial trade-offs arising from the design of the transmit beamformer in a monostatic integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) base station (BS) under bursty traffic, a crucial aspect necessitated by the integration of communication and sensing functionalities in next-generation wireless systems. In this setting, the BS does not always have data available for transmission. This study compares different ISAC policies and reveals the presence of multiple effects influencing ISAC performance: signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) boosting of data-aided strategies compared to pilot-based ones, saturation of the probability of detection in data-aided strategies due to the non-full-buffer assumption, and, finally, directional masking of sensing targets due to the relative position between target and user. Simulation results demonstrate varying impact of these effects on ISAC trade-offs under different operating conditions, thus guiding the design of efficient ISAC transmission strategies.

Title: 6G OFDM Communications with High Mobility Transceivers and Scatterers via Angle-Domain Processing and Deep Learning
Authors: Mauro Marchese, Musa Furkan Keskin, Henk Wymeersch, Pietro Savazzi
Abstract: High-mobility communications, which are crucial for next-generation wireless systems, cause the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform to suffer from strong intercarrier interference (ICI) due to the Doppler effect. In this work, we propose a novel receiver architecture for OFDM that leverages the angular domain to separate multipaths. A block-type pilot is sent to estimate direction-of-arrivals (DoAs), propagation delays, and channel gains of the multipaths. Subsequently, a decision-directed (DD) approach is employed to estimate and iteratively refine the Dopplers. Two different approaches are investigated to provide initial Doppler estimates: an error vector magnitude (EVM)-based method and a deep learning (DL)-based method. Simulation results reveal that the DL-based approach allows for constant bit error rate (BER) performance up to the maximum 6G speed of 1000 km/h.

Title: Physics-Aware RIS Codebook Compilation for Near-Field Beam Focusing under Mutual Coupling and Specular Reflections
Authors: Alexandros I. Papadopoulos, Maria Anna Pistela, Dimitrios Tyrovolas, Antonios Lalas, Konstantinos Votis, Sotiris Ioannidis, George K. Karagiannidis, Christos Liaskos
Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks are envisioned to achieve reliable, low-latency connectivity within environments characterized by strong multipath and severe channel variability. Programmable wireless environments (PWEs) address this challenge by enabling deterministic control of electromagnetic (EM) propagation through software-defined reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). However, effectively configuring RISs in real time remains a major bottleneck, particularly under near-field conditions where mutual coupling and specular reflections alter the intended response. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces MATCH, a physics-based codebook compilation algorithm that explicitly accounts for the EM coupling among RIS unit cells and the reflective interactions with surrounding structures, ensuring that the resulting codebooks remain consistent with the physical characteristics of the environment. Finally, MATCH is evaluated under a full-wave simulation framework incorporating mutual coupling and secondary reflections, demonstrating its ability to concentrate scattered energy within the focal region, confirming that physics-consistent, codebook-based optimization constitutes an effective approach for practical and efficient RIS configuration.

Title: Guiding vector field-based guidance under wind disturbances applied to a tailsitter UAV
Authors: Evangelos Ntouros, Ewoud J. J. Smeur
Abstract: This paper develops a guidance control law based on a parametric Guiding Vector Field (GVF) and integrates it with a state-of-the-art acceleration and attitude control architecture for tailsitters. The resulting framework enables a direct comparison between traditional trajectory-tracking guidance and GVF-based path-following guidance using a realistic tailsitter model operating under windy conditions. Through extensive simulations, it is shown that for agile flight scenarios with wind and small initial position error, both guidance strategies achieve comparable tracking performance, indicating that the additional complexity introduced by the GVF formulation is not always justified. However, the GVF-based approach exhibits an advantage when initial deviation from the path is present, yielding smooth and well-behaved convergence toward the desired path. Two additional contributions support this evaluation. First, a modification of the parametric GVF is proposed that guarantees exponential stability of the tracking error dynamics for a single integrator system. Second, the differential flatness transform of a tailsitter vehicle is extended to account for explicit knowledge of the wind velocity vector.

Title: When Is Distributed Nonlinear Aggregation Private? Optimality and Information-Theoretical Bounds
Authors: Wenrui Yu, Jaron Skovsted Gundersen, Richard Heusdens, Qiongxiu Li
Abstract: Nonlinear aggregation is central to modern distributed systems, yet its privacy behavior is far less understood than that of linear aggregation. Unlike linear aggregation where mature mechanisms can often suppress information leakage, nonlinear operators impose inherent structural limits on what privacy guarantees are theoretically achievable when the aggregate must be computed exactly. This paper develops a unified information-theoretic framework to characterize privacy leakage in distributed nonlinear aggregation under a joint adversary that combines passive (honest-but-curious) corruption and eavesdropping over communication channels. We cover two broad classes of nonlinear aggregates: order-based operators (maximum/minimum and top-$K$) and robust aggregation (median/quantiles and trimmed mean). We first derive fundamental lower bounds on leakage that hold without sacrificing accuracy, thereby identifying the minimum unavoidable information revealed by the computation and the transcript. We then propose simple yet effective privacy-preserving distributed algorithms, and show that with appropriate randomized initialization and parameter choices, our proposed approaches can attach the derived optimal bounds for the considered operators. Extensive experiments validate the tightness of the bounds and demonstrate that network topology and key algorithmic parameters (including the stepsize) govern the observed leakage in line with the theoretical analysis, yielding actionable guidelines for privacy-preserving nonlinear aggregation.

Title: Feedforward-Feedback Integration in Flight Control: Reinforcement Learning with Sliding Mode Control
Authors: Imran Sayyed, Nandan Kumar Sinha
Abstract: Learning-based controllers leverage nonlinear couplings and enhance transients but seldom offer guarantees under tight input constraints. Robust feedback like sliding-mode control (SMC) provides these guarantees but is conservative in isolation. This paper creates a learning-augmented framework where a deep reinforcement learning policy produces feedforward commands and an SMC law imposes actuator limits, bounds learned authority, and guarantees robustness. The policy is modeled as a matched, bounded input, and Lyapunov-based conditions link SMC gains to the admissible feedforward bound, guaranteeing stability under saturation. This formulation is applicable to nonlinear, underactuated plants with hard constraints. To illustrate the methodology, the method is applied to a six-degree-of-freedom aircraft model and compared with Reinforcement Learning and isolated SMC. Simulation results show that the hybrid controller improves transient behavior and reduces control oscillations compared to standalone RL and SMC controllers, while preserving robustness under modeling uncertainties and disturbances. Even using it with partially trained policies, SMC component of the control stabilizes transients, whereas fully trained policies provide faster convergence, reduced constraint violations, and robustness. These results illustrate that learning-augmented control offers superior performance with robustness guarantees under tight input constraints.

Title: VoCodec: An Efficient Lightweight Low-Bitrate Speech Codec
Authors: Leyan Yang, Ronghui Hu, Yang Xu, Jing Lu
Abstract: Recent advancements in end-to-end neural speech codecs enable compressing audio at extremely low bitrates while maintaining high-fidelity reconstruction. Meanwhile, low computational complexity and low latency are crucial for real-time communication. In this paper, we propose VoCodec, a speech codec model featuring a computational complexity of only 349.29M multiply-accumulate operations per second (MACs/s) and a latency of 30 ms. With the competitive vocoder Vocos as its backbone, the proposed model ranked fourth on Track 1 in the 2025 LRAC Challenge and achieved the highest subjective evaluation score (MUSHRA) on the clean speech test set. Additionally, we cascade a lightweight neural network at the front end to extend its capability of speech enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate that the two systems achieve competitive performance across multiple evaluation metrics. Speech samples can be found at this https URL.

Title: Convex Model Predictive Control for Safe Output Consensus of Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems
Authors: Chao Wang, Shuyuan Zhang, Lei Wang
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamics and safety constraints typically result in a nonlinear programming problem when applying model predictive control to achieve safe output consensus. To avoid the heavy computational burden of solving a nonlinear programming problem directly, this paper proposes a novel Convex Model Predictive Control (CMPC) approach based on a Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) scheme. The core of our method lies in transforming the nonlinear constraints into linear forms: we linearize the system dynamics and convexify the discrete-time high-order control barrier functions using a proposed tangent-line projection method. Consequently, the original problem is reduced to a quadratic program that can be iteratively solved within the SQP scheme at each time step of CMPC. Furthermore, we provide the formal guarantee of the convergence of the SQP scheme, and subsequently guarantee the recursive feasibility and stability of CMPC. Simulations on multi-agent systems with unicycle dynamics demonstrate a 35-52 times reduction in computation time compared with baseline methods, confirming the suitability of the proposed approach for real-time safe output consensus control.

Title: OTFS-IDMA: An Unsourced Multiple Access Scheme for Doubly-Dispersive Channels
Authors: Davide Bergamasco, Federico Clazzer, Paolo Casari
Abstract: We present an unsourced multiple access (UMAC) scheme tailored to high-mobility wireless channels. The proposed construction is based on orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation and sparse interleaver division multiple access (IDMA) in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain. The receiver runs a compressive-sensing joint activity-detection and channel estimation process followed by a single-user decoder which harnesses multipath diversity via the maximal-ratio combining (MRC) principle. Numerical results show the potential of DD-based uncoordinated schemes in the presence of double selectivity, while remarking the design tradeoffs and remaining challenges introduced by the proposed design.

Title: Stability of Information-Based Routing in Dynamic Transportation Networks
Authors: Shaya Garjani, Ashish Cherukuri, Bayu Jayawardhana, Nima Monshizadeh
Abstract: Recent studies on transportation networks have shown that real-time route guidance can inadvertently induce congestion or oscillatory traffic patterns. Nevertheless, such technologies also offer a promising opportunity to manage traffic non-intrusively by shaping the information delivered to users, thereby mitigating congestion and enhancing network stability. A key step toward this goal is to identify information signals that ensure the existence of an equilibrium with desirable stability and convergence properties. This challenge is particularly relevant when traffic density and routing dynamics evolve concurrently, as increasingly occurs with digital signaling and real-time navigation technologies. To address this, we analyze a parallel-path transportation network with a single origin-destination pair, incorporating joint traffic density and logit-based routing dynamics that evolve at the same timescale. We characterize a class of density-dependent traffic information that guarantees a unique equilibrium in the free-flow regime, ensures its asymptotic stability, and keeps traffic densities within the free-flow region for all time. The theoretical results are complemented by a numerical case study demonstrating how the framework can inform the design of traffic information that reduces total travel time without compromising credibility.

Title: Non-Invasive Diagnosis for Clubroot Using Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy and Physics-Constrained Neural Networks
Authors: Pengfei Zhu, Jiaxu Wu, Alyson Deslongchamps, Yubin Zhang, Xavier Maldague
Abstract: Clubroot, a major soilborne disease affecting canola and other cruciferous crops, is characterized by the development of large galls on the roots of susceptible hosts. In this study, we present the first application of terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) as a non-invasive diagnosis tool in plant pathology. Compared with conventional molecular, spectroscopic, and immunoassay-based methods, THz-TDS offers distinct advantages, including non-contact, non-destructive, and preparation-free measurement, enabling rapid in situ screening of plant and soil samples. Our results demonstrate that THz-TDS can differentiate between healthy and clubroot-infected tissues by detecting both structural and biochemical alterations. Specifically, infected roots exhibit a blue shift in the refractive index in the low-frequency THz range, along with distinct peaks-indicative of disruptions in water transport and altered metabolic activity in both roots and leaves. Interestingly, the characteristic root swelling observed in infected plants reflects internal tissue disorganization rather than an actual increase in water content. Furthermore, a physics-constrained neural network is proposed to extract the main feature in THz-TDS. A comprehensive evaluation, including time-domain signals, amplitude and phase images, refractive index and absorption coefficient maps, and principal component analysis, provides enhanced contrast and spatial resolution compared to raw time-domain or frequency signals. These findings suggest that THz-TDS holds significant potential for early, non-destructive detection of plant diseases and may serve as a valuable tool to limit their spread in agricultural systems.

Title: Content Leakage in LibriSpeech and Its Impact on the Privacy Evaluation of Speaker Anonymization
Authors: Carlos Franzreb, Arnab Das, Tim Polzehl, Sebastian Möller
Abstract: Speaker anonymization aims to conceal a speaker's identity, without considering the linguistic content. In this study, we reveal a weakness of Librispeech, the dataset that is commonly used to evaluate anonymizers: the books read by the Librispeech speakers are so distinct, that speakers can be identified by their vocabularies. Even perfect anonymizers cannot prevent this identity leakage. The EdAcc dataset is better in this regard: only a few speakers can be identified through their vocabularies, encouraging the attacker to look elsewhere for the identities of the anonymized speakers. EdAcc also comprises spontaneous speech and more diverse speakers, complementing Librispeech and giving more insights into how anonymizers work.

Title: AMDM-SE: Attention-based Multichannel Diffusion Model for Speech Enhancement
Authors: Renana Opochinsky, Sharon Gannot
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved impressive results in reconstructing images from noisy inputs, and similar ideas have been applied to speech enhancement by treating time-frequency representations as images. With the ubiquity of multi-microphone devices, we extend state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods to exploit multichannel inputs for improved performance. Multichannel diffusion-based enhancement remains in its infancy, with prior work making limited use of advanced mechanisms such as attention for spatial modeling - a gap addressed in this paper. We propose AMDM-SE, an Attention-based Multichannel Diffusion Model for Speech Enhancement, designed specifically for noise reduction. AMDM-SE leverages spatial inter-channel information through a novel cross-channel time-frequency attention block, enabling faithful reconstruction of fine-grained signal details within a generative diffusion framework. On the CHiME-3 benchmark, AMDM-SE outperforms both a single-channel diffusion baseline and a multichannel model without attention, as well as a strong DNN-based predictive method. Simulated-data experiments further underscore the importance of the proposed multichannel attention mechanism. Overall, our results show that incorporating targeted multichannel attention into diffusion models substantially improves noise reduction. While multichannel diffusion-based speech enhancement is still an emerging field, our work contributes a new and complementary approach to the growing body of research in this direction.

Title: Seeing Radio: From Zero RF Priors to Explainable Modulation Recognition with Vision Language Models
Authors: Hang Zou, Bohao Wang, Yu Tian, Lina Bariah, Chongwen Huang, Samson Lasaulce, Mérouane Debbah
Abstract: The rise of vision language models (VLMs) paves a new path for radio frequency (RF) perception. Rather than designing task-specific neural receivers, we ask if VLMs can learn to recognize modulations when RF waveforms are expressed as images. In this work, we find that they can. In specific, in this paper, we introduce a practical pipeline for converting complex IQ streams into visually interpretable inputs, hence, enabling general-purpose VLMs to classify modulation schemes without changing their underlying design. Building on this, we construct an RF visual question answering (VQA) benchmark framework that covers 57 classes across major families of analog/digital modulations with three complementary image modes, namely, (i) short \emph{time-series} IQ segments represented as real/imaginary traces, (ii) magnitude-only \emph{spectrograms}, and (iii) \emph{joint} representations that pair spectrograms with a synchronized time-series waveforms. We design uniform zero-shot and few-shot prompts for both class-level and family-level evaluations. Our finetuned VLMs with these images achieve competitive accuracy of $90\%$ compared to $10\%$ of the base models. Furthermore, the fine-tuned VLMs show robust performance under noise and demonstrate high generalization performance to unseen modulation types, without relying on RF-domain priors or specialized architectures. The obtained results show that combining RF-to-image conversion with promptable VLMs provides a scalable and practical foundation for RF-aware AI systems in future 6G networks.

Title: QoS-Aware Energy Optimization via Cell Switching in Heterogeneous Networks
Authors: Maryam Salamatmoghadasi, Amir Mehrabian, Halim Yanikomeroglu, Georges Kaddoum
Abstract: The growing demand for mobile data services in dense urban areas has intensified the need for energy-efficient radio access networks (RANs) in future 6G systems. In this context, one promising strategy is cell switching (CS), which dynamically deactivates underutilized small base stations (SBSs) to reduce power consumption. However, while previous research explored CS primarily based on traffic load, ensuring user quality of service (QoS) under realistic channel conditions remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization-driven CS framework that jointly minimizes network power consumption and guarantees user QoS by enforcing a minimum received power threshold as part of offloading decisions. In contrast to prior load-based or learning-based approaches, our method explicitly integrates channel-aware information into the CS process, thus ensuring reliable service quality for offloaded users. Furthermore, flexibility of the proposed framework enables operators to adapt system behavior between energy-saving and QoS-preserving modes by tuning a single design parameter. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves up to 30% power savings as compared to baseline methods while fully maintaining QoS under diverse network conditions. Scalability and robustness of the proposed method in realistic heterogeneous networks (HetNets) further highlight its potential as a practical solution for sustainable 6G deployments.

Title: Decentralized Cooperative Beamforming for BDRIS-Assisted Cell-Free MIMO OFDM Systems
Authors: Konstantinos D. Katsanos, George C. Alexandropoulos
Abstract: In this paper, a wideband cell-free multi-stream multi-user Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system is considered operating within a smart wireless environment enabled by multiple Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (BDRISs). A novel decentralized active and passive beamforming framework, robust to imperfect channel state availability and with minimal cooperation among the system's multiple Base Stations (BSs) for deciding the final configurations of the shared BDRISs, is proposed, which aims to substantially reduce the overhead inherent in centralized solutions necessitating a central processing unit of high computational power. By considering a Dynamic Group-Connected (DGC) BDRIS architecture with frequency-selective responses per unit element, we formulate the system's sum-rate maximization problem with respect to the tunable capacitances and permutation matrices of the BDRISs as well as the precoding matrices of the BSs, which is solved via successive concave approximation and alternating projections as well as consensus-based updates for the BDRISs' design. Through extensive simulation results, it is showcased that the proposed robust decentralized cooperative approach with diverse BDRIS architectures outperforms non-cooperation benchmarks. It is also demonstrated that the considered DGC BDRIS architecture is able to provide sum-rate performance gains sufficiently close to the more complex fully-connected BDRIS structure.

Title: Emissions and cost tradeoffs of time-matched clean electricity procurement under inter-annual weather variability: case study of hydrogen production
Authors: Michael Giovanniello, Dharik S. Mallapragada
Abstract: Time-matching requirements (TMRs) for clean electricity procurement are increasingly adopted in voluntary corporate sustainability initiatives and regulatory frameworks. While prior research has evaluated cost and emissions impacts of hourly vs. annual TMR, these studies typically rely on single-year weather scenarios that do not capture inter-annual variability in variable renewable energy (VRE) generation. We use a capacity expansion model to assess how inter-annual weather variability affects procurement-driven infrastructure investments, costs, and emissions for a grid-connected hydrogen producer under both annual and hourly time-matching strategies. Using a Texas case study, we compare deterministic (single weather scenario) and stochastic (nine weather scenarios) modeling approaches. Both procurement investments and cost and emissions outcomes are sensitive to weather scenario, with annual matching exhibiting greater sensitivity than hourly matching. Stochastic modeling finds higher cost premiums for hourly versus annual matching compared to deterministic modeling, though emissions trends remain directionally consistent. Demand flexibility through H2 storage is critical for lowering hourly matching cost premiums under weather-driven VRE variability. Partial hourly matching (e.g., 80-90% compliance) can modestly reduce costs while maintaining minimal emissions impacts. Finally, we examine how grid-level renewable portfolio standards (RPS) affect additionality and emissions. When stringent additionality is achieved via binding RPS constraints on non-H2 electricity demand, annual matching can produce emissions reductions comparable to hourly matching at lower cost.

Title: Hierarchical Sparse Vector Transmission for Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communications
Authors: Yanfeng Zhang, Xi'an Fan, Jinkai Zheng, Xiaoye Jing, Weiwei Yang, Xu Zhu
Abstract: Sparse vector transmission (SVT) is a promising candidate technology for achieving ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). In this paper, a hierarchical SVT scheme is proposed for multi-user URLLC scenarios. The hierarchical SVT scheme partitions the transmitted bits into common and private parts. The common information is conveyed by the indices of non-zero sections in a sparse vector, while each user's private information is embedded into non-zero blocks with specific block lengths. At the receiver, the common bits are first recovered from the detected non-zero sections, followed by user-specific private bits decoding based on the corresponding non-zero block indices. Simulation results show the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art SVT schemes in terms of block error rate.

Title: Co-Channel Interference Mitigation Using Deep Learning for Drone-Based Large-Scale Antenna Measurements
Authors: Kadyrzhan Tortayev, Oliver Falkenberg Damborg, Jònas À Hàlvmørk Joensen, Jonas Pedesk, Yifa Li, Fengchun Zhang, Zeliang An, Yubo Wang, Ming Shen
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enable efficient in-situ radiation characterization of large-aperture antennas directly in their deployment environments. In such measurements, a continuous-wave (CW) probe tone is commonly transmitted to characterize the antenna response. However, active co-channel emissions from neighboring antennas often introduce severe in-band interference, where classical FFT-based estimators fail to accurately estimate the CW tone amplitude when the signal-to-interference ratios (SIR) falls below -10 dB. This paper proposes a lightweight deep convolutional neural network (DC-CNN) that estimates the amplitude of the CW tone. The model is trained and evaluated on real 5~GHz measurement bursts spanning an effective SIR range of --33.3 dB to +46.7 dB. Despite its compact size (<20k parameters), the proposed DC-CNN achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 7% over the full range, with <1 dB error for SIR >= -30 dB. This robustness and efficiency make DC-CNN suitable for deployment on embedded UAV platforms for interference-resilient antenna pattern characterization.

Title: Pixelwise Uncertainty Quantification of Accelerated MRI Reconstruction
Authors: Ilias I. Giannakopoulos, Lokesh B Gautham Muthukumar, Yvonne W. Lui, Riccardo Lattanzi
Abstract: Parallel imaging techniques reduce magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan time but image quality degrades as the acceleration factor increases. In clinical practice, conservative acceleration factors are chosen because no mechanism exists to automatically assess the diagnostic quality of undersampled reconstructions. This work introduces a general framework for pixel-wise uncertainty quantification in parallel MRI reconstructions, enabling automatic identification of unreliable regions without access to any ground-truth reference image. Our method integrates conformal quantile regression with image reconstruction methods to estimate statistically rigorous pixel-wise uncertainty intervals. We trained and evaluated our model on Cartesian undersampled brain and knee data obtained from the fastMRI dataset using acceleration factors ranging from 2 to 10. An end-to-end Variational Network was used for image reconstruction. Quantitative experiments demonstrate strong agreement between predicted uncertainty maps and true reconstruction error. Using our method, the corresponding Pearson correlation coefficient was higher than 90% at acceleration levels at and above four-fold; whereas it dropped to less than 70% when the uncertainty was computed using a simpler a heuristic notion (magnitude of the residual). Qualitative examples further show the uncertainty maps based on quantile regression capture the magnitude and spatial distribution of reconstruction errors across acceleration factors, with regions of elevated uncertainty aligning with pathologies and artifacts. The proposed framework enables evaluation of reconstruction quality without access to fully-sampled ground-truth reference images. It represents a step toward adaptive MRI acquisition protocols that may be able to dynamically balance scan time and diagnostic reliability.

Title: Safe Navigation in Cluttered Environments Via Spline-Based Harmonic Potential Fields
Authors: Theodor-Gabriel Nicu, Florin Stoican, Daniel-Mihail Ioan, Ionela Prodan
Abstract: We provide a complete motion-planning mechanism that ensures target tracking and obstacle avoidance in a cluttered environment. For a given polyhedral decomposition of the feasible space, we adopt a novel procedure that constrains the agent to move only through a prescribed sequence of cells via a suitable control policy. For each cell, we construct a harmonic potential surface induced by a Dirichlet boundary condition given as a cardinal B-spline curve. A detailed analysis of the curve behavior (periodicity, support) and of the associated control point selection allows us to explicitly compute these harmonic potential surfaces, from which we subsequently derive the corresponding control policy. We illustrate that the resulting construction funnels the agent safely along the chain of cells from the starting point to the target.

Title: Semantic Communication in Underwater IoT Networks for Meaning-Driven Connectivity
Authors: Ruhul Amin Khalil, Asiya Jehangir, Hanane Lamaazi, Sadaf Rubab, Nasir Saeed
Abstract: The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) is revolutionizing marine sensing and environmental monitoring, as well as subaquatic exploration, which are enabled by interconnected and intelligent subsystems. Nevertheless, underwater communication is constrained by narrow bandwidth, high latency, and strict energy constraints, which are the source of efficiency problems in traditional data-centric networks. To tackle these problematic issues, this work provides a survey of recent advances in Semantic Communication (SC) for IoUT, a novel communication paradigm that seeks to harness not raw symbol information but rather its meaning and/or contextual significance. In this paper, we investigate the emerging advanced AI-powered frameworks, including large language models (LLMs), diffusion-based generative encoders, and federated learning (FL), that bridge semantic compression with context-aware prioritization and robust information reconstruction over noisy underwater channels. Hybrid acoustic-optical-RF architectures and edge-intelligent semantic encoders are also considered enablers of sustainable, adaptive operations. Examples in underwater archaeology, marine ecology, and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) coordination are provided as a relief to illustrate the merits of meaning-driven connectivity. The paper concludes with some recommendations, including semantic representations standardization, cross-domain interpolation, and privacy-support schemes. These issues must be addressed in the future before trustworthy SC-enabled IoUT systems can be developed for underwater communication.

Title: RetinexGuI: Retinex-Guided Iterative Illumination Estimation Method for Low Light Images
Authors: Yasin Demir, Nur Hüseyin Kaplan, Sefa Kucuk, Nagihan Severoglu
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in low-light image enhancement (LLIE) due to its importance for critical downstream tasks. Current Retinex-based methods and learning-based approaches have shown significant LLIE performance. However, computational complexity and dependencies on large training datasets often limit their applicability in real-time applications. We introduce RetinexGuI, a novel and effective Retinex-guided LLIE framework to overcome these limitations. The proposed method first separates the input image into illumination and reflection layers, and iteratively refines the illumination while keeping the reflectance component unchanged. With its simplified formulation and computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N)$, our RetinexGuI demonstrates impressive enhancement performance across three public datasets, indicating strong potential for large-scale applications. Furthermore, it opens promising directions for theoretical analysis and integration with deep learning approaches. The source code will be made publicly available at this https URL once the paper is accepted.

Title: VAST: Vascular Flow Analysis and Segmentation for Intracranial 4D Flow MRI
Authors: Abhishek Singh, Vitaliy L. Rayz, Pavlos P. Vlachos
Abstract: Four-dimensional (4D) Flow MRI can noninvasively measure cerebrovascular hemodynamics but remains underused clinically because current workflows rely on manual vessel segmentation and yield velocity fields sensitive to noise, artifacts, and phase aliasing. We present VAST (Vascular Flow Analysis and Segmentation), an automated, unsupervised pipeline for intracranial 4D Flow MRI that couples vessel segmentation with physics-informed velocity reconstruction. VAST derives vessel masks directly from complex 4D Flow data by iteratively fusing magnitude- and phase-based background statistics. It then reconstructs velocities via continuity-constrained phase unwrapping, outlier correction, and low-rank denoising to reduce noise and aliasing while promoting mass-consistent flow fields, with processing completing in minutes per case on a standard CPU. We validate VAST on synthetic data from an internal carotid artery aneurysm model across SNR = 2-20 and severe phase wrapping (up to five-fold), on in vitro Poiseuille flow, and on an in vivo internal carotid aneurysm dataset. In synthetic benchmarks, VAST maintains near quarter-voxel surface accuracy and reduces velocity root-mean-square error by up to fourfold under the most degraded conditions. In vitro, it segments the channel within approximately half a voxel of expert annotations and reduces velocity error by 39% (unwrapped) and 77% (aliased). In vivo, VAST closely matches expert time-of-flight masks and lowers divergence residuals by about 30%, indicating a more self-consistent intracranial flow field. By automating processing and enforcing basic flow physics, VAST helps move intracranial 4D Flow MRI toward routine quantitative use in cerebrovascular assessment.

Title: RLBR: Reinforcement Learning with Biasing Rewards for Contextual Speech Large Language Models
Authors: Bo Ren, Ruchao Fan, Yelong Shen, Weizhu Chen, Jinyu Li
Abstract: Speech large language models (LLMs) have driven significant progress in end-to-end speech understanding and recognition, yet they continue to struggle with accurately recognizing rare words and domain-specific terminology. This paper presents a novel fine-tuning method, Reinforcement Learning with Biasing Rewards (RLBR), which employs a specialized biasing words preferred reward to explicitly emphasize biasing words in the reward calculation. In addition, we introduce reference-aware mechanisms that extend the reinforcement learning algorithm with reference transcription to strengthen the potential trajectory exploration space. Experiments on the LibriSpeech corpus across various biasing list sizes demonstrate that RLBR delivers substantial performance improvements over a strong supervised fine-tuning (SFT) baseline and consistently outperforms several recently published methods. The proposed approach achieves excellent performance on the LibriSpeech test-clean and test-other sets, reaching Biasing Word Error Rates (BWERs) of 0.59% / 2.11%, 1.09% / 3.24%, and 1.36% / 4.04% for biasing list sizes of 100, 500, and 1000, respectively, without compromising the overall WERs.

Title: Autonomous Self-Healing UAV Swarms for Robust 6G Non-Terrestrial Networks
Authors: Sambrama Hegde, Venkata Srirama Rohit Kantheti, Liang C Chu, Erik Blasch, Shih-Chun Lin
Abstract: Recent years have seen an increased interest in the use of Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), especially the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to provide cost-effective global connectivity in next-generation wireless networks. We introduce a resilient, adaptive, self-healing network design (RASHND) to optimize signal quality under dynamic interference and adversarial conditions. RASHND leverages inter-node communication and an intelligent algorithm selection process, incorporating combining techniques like distributed-Maximal Ratio Combining (d-MRC), distributed-Linear Minimum Mean Squared Error Estimation(d-LMMSE), and Selection Combining (SC). These algorithms are selected to improve performance by adapting to changing network conditions. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed RASHND solutions, a software-defined radio (SDR)-based hardware testbed afforded initial testing and evaluations. Additionally, we present results from UAV tests conducted on the AERPAW testbed to validate our solutions in real-world scenarios. The results demonstrate that RASHND significantly enhances the reliability and interference resilience of UAV networks, making them well-suited for critical communications.

Title: Joint Subarray Selection, User Scheduling, and Pilot Assignment for XL-MIMO
Authors: Gabriel Avanzi Ubiali, José Carlos Marinello Filho, Taufik Abrão
Abstract: Extra-large scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) is a key technology for meeting sixth-generation (6G) requirements for high-rate connectivity and uniform quality of service (QoS); however, its deployment is challenged by the prohibitive complexity of resource management based on instantaneous channel state information (CSI). To address this intractability, this work derives novel closed-form deterministic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) expressions for both centralized and distributed uplink operations. Valid for Rician fading channels with minimum mean square error (MMSE) receive combining and MMSE channel estimation, these expressions depend exclusively on long-term channel statistics, providing a tractable alternative to computationally expensive instantaneous CSI-driven optimization. Building on these results, we develop statistical-CSI-based algorithms for joint subarray selection, users scheduling, and pilot assignment, leveraging the derived SINR approximations to maximize the minimum spectral efficiency (SE) among scheduled users while preserving computational tractability. The proposed framework exploits the spatial sparsity of user equipment (UE) visibility regions (VRs) to enable more aggressive pilot reuse than is possible in conventional massive MIMO. Numerical results validate the high accuracy of the derived SINR approximations and demonstrate that the proposed algorithms significantly enhance fairness and throughput in crowded scenarios.

Title: Near-field Physical Layer Security: Robust Beamforming under Location Uncertainty
Authors: Chao Zhou, Changsheng You, Cong Zhou, Chengwen Xing, Jianhua Zhang
Abstract: In this paper, we study robust beamforming design for near-field physical-layer-security (PLS) systems, where a base station (BS) equipped with an extremely large-scale array (XL-array) serves multiple near-field legitimate users (Bobs) in the presence of multiple near-field eavesdroppers (Eves). Unlike existing works that mostly assume perfect channel state information (CSI) or location information of Eves, we consider a more practical and challenging scenario, where the locations of Bobs are perfectly known, while only imperfect location information of Eves is available at the BS. We first formulate a robust optimization problem to maximize the sum-rate of Bobs while guaranteeing a worst-case limit on the eavesdropping rate under location uncertainty. By transforming Cartesian position errors into the polar domain, we reveal an important near-field angular-error amplification effect: for the same location error, the closer the Eve, the larger the angle error, severely degrading the performance of conventional robust beamforming methods based on imperfect channel state information. To address this issue, we first establish the conditions for which the first-order Taylor approximation of the near-field channel steering vector under location uncertainty is largely accurate. Then, we propose a two-stage robust beamforming method, which first partitions the uncertainty region into multiple fan-shaped sub-regions, followed by the second stage to formulate and solve a refined linear-matrix-inequality (LMI)-based robust beamforming optimization problem. In addition, the proposed method is further extended to scenarios with multiple Bobs and multiple Eves. Finally, numerical results validate that the proposed method achieves a superior trade-off between rate performance and secrecy robustness, hence significantly outperforming existing benchmarks under Eve location uncertainty.

Title: Instant Preliminary Cardiac Analysis from Smartphone Auscultation: A Real-World Canine Heart Sound Dataset and Evaluation
Authors: Aswin Jose (1), Roeland P. J. E. Decorte (1), Laurent Locquet (1 and 2),  ((1) Decorte Future Industries Ltd / Sonus Health, (2) Honorary Associate Professor, University of Nottingham)
Abstract: This study presents a real-world canine heart sound dataset and evaluates SoNUS version 3.2.x, a machine learning algorithm for preliminary cardiac analysis using smartphone microphone recordings. More than one hundred recordings were collected from dogs across four continents, with thirty eight recordings annotated by board certified veterinary cardiologists for quantitative evaluation. SoNUS version 3.2.x employs a multi-stage fallback architecture with quality-aware filtering to ensure reliable output under variable recording conditions. The primary sixty second model achieved mean and median heart rate accuracies of ninety one point six three percent and ninety four point nine five percent, while a fast model optimized for thirty to forty second recordings achieved mean and median accuracies of eighty eight point eight six percent and ninety two point nine eight percent. These results demonstrate the feasibility of extracting clinically relevant cardiac information from opportunistic smartphone recordings, supporting scalable preliminary assessment and telehealth applications in veterinary cardiology.

Title: Outage Identification from Electricity Market Data: Quickest Change Detection Approach
Authors: Milad Hoseinpour, Shubhanshu Shekhar, Vladimir Dvorkin
Abstract: Power system outages expose market participants to significant financial risk unless promptly detected and hedged. We develop an outage identification method from public market signals grounded in the parametric quickest change detection (QCD) theory. Parametric QCD operates on stochastic data streams, distinguishing pre- and post-change regimes using the ratio of their respective probability density functions. To derive the density functions for normal and post-outage market signals, we exploit multi-parametric programming to decompose complex market signals into parametric random variables with a known density. These densities are then used to construct a QCD-based statistic that triggers an alarm as soon as the statistic exceeds an appropriate threshold. Numerical experiments on a stylized PJM testbed demonstrate rapid line outage identification from public streams of electricity demand and price data.

Abstract: Hybrid microgrids integrating Grid-Following (GFL) and Grid-Forming (GFM) inverters present complex control challenges arising from the decoupling between long-term economic dispatch and real-time dynamic regulation, as well as the distinct physical limitations of heterogeneous inverters under cyber uncertainties. This paper proposes a Resilient Hierarchical Power Control (RHPC) strategy to unify these conflicting requirements within a cohesive framework. A standardized power increment mechanism is developed to bridge the tertiary and secondary layers, ensuring that real-time load fluctuations are compensated strictly according to the optimal economic ratios derived from the tertiary layer. To address the strict active power saturation constraints of GFL units, a dynamic activation scheme coupled with projection operators is introduced, which actively isolates saturated nodes from the consensus loop to prevent integrator wind-up and preserve the stability of the GFM backbone. Furthermore, the proposed framework incorporates a multi-scale attention mechanism and LSTM-based predictors into the secondary control protocol, endowing the system with robustness against unbounded False Data Injection (FDI) attacks and packet losses. Rigorous theoretical analysis confirms that the system achieves Uniformly Ultimately Bounded (UUB) convergence, and simulations on a modified IEEE 33-bus system demonstrate that the proposed strategy significantly improves power sharing accuracy and operational resilience in both grid-connected and islanded modes compared to conventional methods.

Title: S$^2$Voice: Style-Aware Autoregressive Modeling with Enhanced Conditioning for Singing Style Conversion
Authors: Ziqian Wang, Xianjun Xia, Chuanzeng Huang, Lei Xie
Abstract: We present S$^2$Voice, the winning system of the Singing Voice Conversion Challenge (SVCC) 2025 for both the in-domain and zero-shot singing style conversion tracks. Built on the strong two-stage Vevo baseline, S$^2$Voice advances style control and robustness through several contributions. First, we integrate style embeddings into the autoregressive large language model (AR LLM) via a FiLM-style layer-norm conditioning and a style-aware cross-attention for enhanced fine-grained style modeling. Second, we introduce a global speaker embedding into the flow-matching transformer to improve timbre similarity. Third, we curate a large, high-quality singing corpus via an automated pipeline for web harvesting, vocal separation, and transcript refinement. Finally, we employ a multi-stage training strategy combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO). Subjective listening tests confirm our system's superior performance: leading in style similarity and singer similarity for Task 1, and across naturalness, style similarity, and singer similarity for Task 2. Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our contributions in enhancing style fidelity, timbre preservation, and generalization. Audio samples are available~\footnote{this https URL}.

Title: Deep Learning-Enabled Signal Detection for MIMO-OTFS-Based 6G and Future Wireless Networks
Authors: Emin Akpinar, Emir Aslandogan, Burak Ahmet Ozden, Haci Ilhan, Erdogan Aydin
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation stands out as a promising waveform for sixth generation (6G) and beyond wireless communication systems, offering superior performance over conventional methods, particularly in high-mobility scenarios and dispersive channel conditions. Recent research has demonstrated that the reduced computational complexity of deep learning (DL)-based signal detection (SD) methods constitutes a compelling alternative to conventional techniques. In this study, low-complexity DL-based SD methods are proposed for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-OTFS system and examined under Nakagami-$m$ channel conditions. The symbols obtained from the receiver antennas are combined using maximum ratio combining (MRC) and detected with the help of a DL-based detector implemented with multi-layer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and residual network (ResNet). Complexity analysis reveals that the MLP architecture offers significantly lower computational complexity compared to CNN, ResNet, and classical methods such as maximum likelihood detection (MLD). Furthermore, numerical analyses have shown that the proposed DL-based detectors, despite their low complexity, achieve comparable bit error rate (BER) performance to that of a high-performance MLD under various system conditions.

Title: TSN-IoT: A Two-Stage NOMA-Enabled Framework for Prioritized Traffic Handling in Dense IoT Networks
Authors: Shama Siddiqui, Anwar Ahmed Khan, Nicola Marchetti
Abstract: With the growing applications of the Internet of Things (IoT), a major challenge is to ensure continuous connectivity while providing prioritized access. In dense IoT scenarios, synchronization may be disrupted either by the movement of nodes away from base stations or by the unavailability of reliable Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals, which can be affected by physical obstructions, multipath fading, or environmental interference, such as such as walls, buildings, moving objects, or electromagnetic noise from surrounding devices. In such contexts, distributed synchronization through Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) offers a promising solution, as it enables simultaneous transmission to multiple users with different power levels, supporting efficient synchronization while minimizing the signaling overhead. Moreover, NOMA also plays a vital role for dynamic priority management in dense and heterogeneous IoT environments. In this article, we proposed a Two-Stage NOMA-Enabled Framework "TSN-IoT" that integrates the mechanisms of conventional Precision Time Protocol (PTP) based synchronization, distributed synchronization and data transmission. The framework is designed as a four-tier architecture that facilitates prioritized data delivery from sensor nodes to the central base station. We demonstrated the performance of "TSN-IoT" through a healthcare use case, where intermittent connectivity and varying data priority levels present key challenges for reliable communication. Synchronization speed and end-to-end delay were evaluated through a series of simulations implemented in Python. Results show that, compared to priority-based Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), TSN-IoT achieves significantly better performance by offering improved synchronization opportunities and enabling parallel transmissions over the same sub-carrier.

Title: Toward Agentic AI: Task-Oriented Communication for Hierarchical Planning of Long-Horizon Tasks
Authors: Sin-Yu Huang
Abstract: Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) is an AI paradigm that can perceive the environment, reason over observations, and execute actions to achieve specific goals. Task-oriented communication supports agentic AI by transmitting only the task-related information instead of full raw data in order to reduce the bandwidth requirement. In real-world scenarios, AI agents often need to perform a sequence of actions to complete complex tasks. Completing these long-horizon tasks requires a hierarchical agentic AI architecture, where a high-level planner module decomposes a task into subtasks, and a low-level actor module executes each subtask sequentially. Since each subtask has a distinct goal, the existing task-oriented communication schemes are not designed to handle different goals for different subtasks. To address this challenge, in this paper, we develop a hierarchical task-oriented communication (HiTOC) framework. We consider a system with an edge server and a robot as an edge device. The high-level planner and low-level actor modules reside on the edge server. The robot transmits only the environment information that is relevant to the current subtask in order to complete a long-horizon task. We propose a conditional variational information bottleneck (cVIB) approach to train the HiTOC framework to adaptively transmit minimal information required for each subtask. Simulations conducted on the AI2-THOR platform demonstrate that the proposed HiTOC framework outperforms three state-of-the-art schemes in terms of the success rate on MAP-THOR benchmark.

Title: Research on Adaptive Inertial Control in Synchronization Systems: Based on Variational Optimization Methods and Their Applications in the Stability of Complex Networks
Authors: Yiwei Zhou, Zhongcheng Lei, Xiaoran Dai, Wenshan Hu, Hong Zhou
Abstract: Aiming at the core problem that it is difficult for a fixed inertia coefficient to balance transient disturbance suppression and long-term stability in complex network synchronization systems, an adaptive inertia control strategy based on variational optimization is proposed. Taking the Kuramoto model with inertia as the research carrier, the analytical expression of the time-varying inertia coefficient M(t) is strictly derived by the functional variational method, and a hierarchical control structure of "benchmark inertia + disturbance feedback" is constructed to achieve the organic unity of minimizing the vulnerability performance function H(T) and stability constraints. A multimodal decoupling control strategy based on Laplacian eigenvector projection is designed to enhance the feedback strength of the dominant mode by eigenvalue weighting, improving the control accuracy and dynamic response speed. Simulation verification is carried out in complex network systems, and the control performance of regular networks (RG), random networks (ER), small-world networks (SW), scale-free networks (SF) and spider webs (SP) under three typical disturbances of pulses, monotonic decays and oscillatory decays is systematically analyzed. The results show that the proposed strategy reduces H(T) of the five networks by 19%-25%, shortens the relaxation time by 15%-24%, and the real parts of all system eigenvalues are less than -0.25s^-1 , meeting the asymptotic stability criterion. This study provides a new theoretical framework and engineering implementation scheme for the stability control of complex network synchronization systems, which can be widely applied to fields such as power grids, communication networks, and neural networks.

Title: Linear viscoelastic rheological FrBD models
Authors: Luigi Romano, Ole Morten Aamo, Jan Åslund, Erik Frisk
Abstract: In [1], a new modeling paradigm for developing rate-and-state-dependent, control-oriented friction models was introduced. The framework, termed Friction with Bristle Dynamics (FrBD), combines nonlinear analytical expressions for the friction coefficient with constitutive equations for bristle-like elements. Within the FrBD framework, this letter introduces two novel formulations based on the two most general linear viscoelastic models for solids: the Generalized Maxwell (GM) and Generalized Kelvin-Voigt (GKV) elements. Both are analyzed in terms of boundedness and passivity, revealing that these properties are satisfied for any physically meaningful parametrization. An application of passivity for control design is also illustrated, considering an example from robotics. The findings of this letter systematically integrate rate-and-state dynamic friction models with linear viscoelasticity.

Title: Integrated Sensing and Communication for Low-Altitude Security
Authors: Ruixing Ren
Abstract: The dense concentration of low-altitude, slow-speed, and small-size targets in the complex low-altitude environment poses significant security challenges, including failures in continuous wide-area sensing and ambiguous target intent, which existing regulatory frameworks struggle to address. Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), a hallmark of next-generation mobile communication, offers a transformative approach to low-altitude security governance. By leveraging existing cellular infrastructure and spectrum resources, ISAC enables the construction of a seamless wide-area sensing network, supports intelligent feature extraction and intent inference, facilitates real-time collaborative decision-making, and establishes a dynamic trust authentication framework. This article systematically reviews the technical system, analyzes the security challenges, forecasts the enabling value of ISAC, and discusses the resulting open problems and challenges, thereby laying a foundation for future research and industrial implementation.

Title: Channel Estimation in MIMO Systems Using Flow Matching Models
Authors: Yongqiang Zhang, Qurrat-Ul-Ain Nadeem
Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems require efficient and accurate channel estimation with low pilot overhead to unlock their full potential for high spectral and energy efficiency. While deep generative models have emerged as a powerful foundation for the channel estimation task, the existing approaches using diffusion-based and score-based models suffer from high computational runtime due to their stochastic and many-step iterative sampling. In this paper, we introduce a flow matching-based channel estimator to overcome this limitation. The proposed channel estimator is based on a deep neural network trained to learn the velocity field of wireless channels, which we then integrate into a plug-and-play proximal gradient descent (PnP-PGD) framework. Simulation results reveal that our formulated approach consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative model-based estimators, achieves up to 49 times faster inference at test time, and reduces up to 20 times peak graphics processing unit (GPU) memory usage. Our code and models are publicly available to support reproducible research.

Title: Base Station Sleeping Strategy Based on Load Sharing in Ultra-Dense Networks
Authors: Ruixing Ren, Shan Chen, Xuehan Bao, Pingzheng Ge, Dongming Wang, Junhui Zhao
Abstract: To address the issues of high operational costs and low energy efficiency (EE) caused by the dense deployment of small base stations (s-BSs) in 5G ultra-dense networks (UDNs), this paper first constructs a multi-objective mathematical optimization model targeting maximizing EE and minimizing the number of active BSs. The model incorporates key constraints including BS operational state, user equipment (UE)-BS connection relationship, and load threshold, laying a theoretical foundation for the coordinated optimization of energy conservation and quality of service. Based on this model, an integrated solution combining UE-BS initial connection optimization and load-sharing based BS sleeping is proposed. In the initial connection phase, with communication quality and BS load as dual constraints, efficient matching between UEs and optimal BSs is achieved through three sequential steps: communication feasibility screening, redundant connection removal, and overload load redistribution. This resolves the problems of load imbalance and difficult identification of redundant BSs in UDNs arising from unordered initial connections. In the BS sleeping phase, a BS sleeping index, comprehensively considering UE transferability and backup BS resources, is innovatively introduced to quantify BS dormancy priority. Through a closed-loop process involving low-load BS screening, adjacent BS load evaluation, and load sharing by two takeover BSs based on their capacity, accurate dormancy of redundant BSs and collaborative load migration are realized. Simulation results in a typical UDNs scenario demonstrate that, compared with the traditional baseline scheme, the proposed solution exhibits significant advantages in convergence speed, optimization of the number of active BSs, and EE improvement.

Title: Small Models, Big Impact: Tool-Augmented AI Agents for Wireless Network Planning
Authors: Yongqiang Zhang, Mustafa A. Kishk, Mohamed-Slim Alouini
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT promise revolutionary capabilities for Sixth-Generation (6G) wireless networks but their massive computational requirements and tendency to generate technically incorrect information create deployment barriers. In this work, we introduce MAINTAINED: autonomous artificial intelligence agent for wireless network deployment. Instead of encoding domain knowledge within model parameters, our approach orchestrates specialized computational tools for geographic analysis, signal propagation modeling, and network optimization. In a real-world case study, MAINTAINED outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs including ChatGPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4, and DeepSeek-R1 by up to 100-fold in verified performance metrics while requiring less computational resources. This paradigm shift, moving from relying on parametric knowledge towards externalizing domain knowledge into verifiable computational tools, eliminates hallucination in technical specifications and enables edge-deployable Artificial Intelligence (AI) for wireless communications.

Title: Co-Initialization of Control Filter and Secondary Path via Meta-Learning for Active Noise Control
Authors: Ziyi Yang, Li Rao, Zhengding Luo, Dongyuan Shi, Qirui Huang, Woon-Seng Gan
Abstract: Active noise control (ANC) must adapt quickly when the acoustic environment changes, yet early performance is largely dictated by initialization. We address this with a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) co-initialization that jointly sets the control filter and the secondary-path model for FxLMS-based ANC while keeping the runtime algorithm unchanged. The initializer is pre-trained on a small set of measured paths using short two-phase inner loops that mimic identification followed by residual-noise reduction, and is applied by simply setting the learned initial coefficients. In an online secondary path modeling FxLMS testbed, it yields lower early-stage error, shorter time-to-target, reduced auxiliary-noise energy, and faster recovery after path changes than a baseline without re-initialization. The method provides a simple fast start for feedforward ANC under environment changes, requiring a small set of paths to pre-train.

Title: Riemannian optimization on the manifold of unitary and symmetric matrices with application to BD-RIS-assisted systems
Authors: Ignacio Santamaria, Mohammad Soleymani, Eduard Jorswieck, Jesus Gutierrez, Carlos Beltran
Abstract: In this paper, we rigorously characterize for the first time the manifold of unitary and symmetric matrices, deriving its tangent space and its geodesics. The resulting parameterization of the geodesics (through a real and symmetric matrix) allows us to derive a new Riemannian manifold optimization (MO) algorithm whose most remarkable feature is that it does not need to set any adaptation parameter. We apply the proposed MO algorithm to maximize the achievable rate in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system assisted by a beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS), illustrating the method's performance through simulations. The MO algorithm achieves a significant reduction in computational cost compared to previous alternatives based on Takagi decomposition, while retaining global convergence to a stationary point of the cost function.

Title: Synthetic Singers: A Review of Deep-Learning-based Singing Voice Synthesis Approaches
Authors: Changhao Pan, Dongyu Yao, Yu Zhang, Wenxiang Guo, Jingyu Lu, Zhiyuan Zhu, Zhou Zhao
Abstract: Recent advances in singing voice synthesis (SVS) have attracted substantial attention from both academia and industry. With the advent of large language models and novel generative paradigms, producing controllable, high-fidelity singing voices has become an attainable goal. Yet the field still lacks a comprehensive survey that systematically analyzes deep-learning-based singing voice synthesis systems and their enabling technologies. To address the aforementioned issue, this survey first categorizes existing systems by task type and then organizes current architectures into two major paradigms: cascaded and end-to-end approaches. Moreover, we provide an in-depth analysis of core technologies, covering singing modeling and control techniques. Finally, we review relevant datasets, annotation tools, and evaluation benchmarks that support training and assessment. In appendix, we introduce training strategies and further discussion of SVS. This survey provides an up-to-date review of the literature on SVS models, which would be a useful reference for both researchers and engineers. Related materials are available at this https URL.

Title: Towards Modality-Agnostic Continual Domain-Incremental Brain Lesion Segmentation
Authors: Yousef Sadegheih, Dorit Merhof, Pratibha Kumari
Abstract: Brain lesion segmentation from multi-modal MRI often assumes fixed modality sets or predefined pathologies, making existing models difficult to adapt across cohorts and imaging protocols. Continual learning (CL) offers a natural solution but current approaches either impose a maximum modality configuration or suffer from severe forgetting in buffer-free settings. We introduce CLMU-Net, a replay-based CL framework for 3D brain lesion segmentation that supports arbitrary and variable modality combinations without requiring prior knowledge of the maximum set. A conceptually simple yet effective channel-inflation strategy maps any modality subset into a unified multi-channel representation, enabling a single model to operate across diverse datasets. To enrich inherently local 3D patch features, we incorporate lightweight domain-conditioned textual embeddings that provide global modality-disease context for each training case. Forgetting is further reduced through principled replay using a compact buffer composed of both prototypical and challenging samples. Experiments on five heterogeneous MRI brain datasets demonstrate that CLMU-Net consistently outperforms popular CL baselines. Notably, our method yields an average Dice score improvement of $\geq$ 18\% while remaining robust under heterogeneous-modality conditions. These findings underscore the value of flexible modality handling, targeted replay, and global contextual cues for continual medical image segmentation. Our implementation is available at this https URL.

Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Dynamic Resource Allocation in Cell-Free Massive MIMO
Authors: Phuong Nam Tran, Nhan Thanh Nguyen, Hien Quoc Ngo, Markku Juntti
Abstract: In this paper, we consider power allocation and antenna activation of cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) systems. We first derive closed-form expressions for the system spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) as functions of the power allocation coefficients and the number of active antennas at the access points (APs). Then, we aim to enhance the EE through jointly optimizing antenna activation and power control. This task leads to a non-convex and mixed-integer design problem with high-dimensional design variables. To address this, we propose a novel DRL-based framework, in which the agent learns to map large-scale fading coefficients to AP activation ratio, antenna coefficient, and power coefficient. These coefficients are then employed to determine the number of active antennas per AP and the power factors assigned to users based on closed-form expressions. By optimizing these parameters instead of directly controlling antenna selection and power allocation, the proposed method transforms the intractable optimization into a low-dimensional learning task. Our extensive simulations demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed scheme. Specifically, in a CFmMIMO system with 40 APs and 20 users, it achieves a 50% EE improvement and 3350 times run time reduction compared to the conventional sequential convex approximation method.

Title: Stream-Voice-Anon: Enhancing Utility of Real-Time Speaker Anonymization via Neural Audio Codec and Language Models
Authors: Nikita Kuzmin, Songting Liu, Kong Aik Lee, Eng Siong Chng
Abstract: Protecting speaker identity is crucial for online voice applications, yet streaming speaker anonymization (SA) remains underexplored. Recent research has demonstrated that neural audio codec (NAC) provides superior speaker feature disentanglement and linguistic fidelity. NAC can also be used with causal language models (LM) to enhance linguistic fidelity and prompt control for streaming tasks. However, existing NAC-based online LM systems are designed for voice conversion (VC) rather than anonymization, lacking the techniques required for privacy protection. Building on these advances, we present Stream-Voice-Anon, which adapts modern causal LM-based NAC architectures specifically for streaming SA by integrating anonymization techniques. Our anonymization approach incorporates pseudo-speaker representation sampling, a speaker embedding mixing and diverse prompt selection strategies for LM conditioning that leverage the disentanglement properties of quantized content codes to prevent speaker information leakage. Additionally, we compare dynamic and fixed delay configurations to explore latency-privacy trade-offs in real-time scenarios. Under the VoicePrivacy 2024 Challenge protocol, Stream-Voice-Anon achieves substantial improvements in intelligibility (up to 46% relative WER reduction) and emotion preservation (up to 28% UAR relative) compared to the previous state-of-the-art streaming method DarkStream while maintaining comparable latency (180ms vs 200ms) and privacy protection against lazy-informed attackers, though showing 15% relative degradation against semi-informed attackers.

Title: Where to Place a Heavy Payload on a Multirotor UAV for Best Control Performance
Authors: Sander Doodeman, Paula Chanfreut Palacio, Elena Torta, Duarte Antunes
Abstract: This paper studies the impact of rigidly attached heavy payload placement - where the payload mass significantly influences the UAV's dynamics - on the stability and control performance of a multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). In particular, we focus on how the position of such a payload relative to the vehicle's Center of Gravity (CoG) affects the stability and control performance at an arbitrary point of interest on the UAV, such as the payload position, and on how this position can be optimized. Our conclusions are based on two key contributions. First, we analyze the stability of the zero-dynamics of a complete nonlinear model of the UAV with payload. We demonstrate that the stability of the zero dynamics depends on the vertical signed distance in the body-fixed frame between the controlled output position and the combined CoG of the UAV with payload. Specifically, positioning the output below the CoG yields unstable zero dynamics, while the linearized zero dynamics are marginally stable when placing it above, indicating reduced sensitivity to input disturbances. Second, we analyze the performance of the linearized UAV model with payload by providing an analytical expression for the H2-norm, from which we can quantify the system's attenuation to white noise input disturbances. We conclude that less control authority leads to a higher optimal position of the controlled output with respect to the CoG for closed-loop white-noise disturbance rejection capabilities, also when the heavy payload is the controlled output. The results are illustrated through numerical examples.

Title: Optimal Calibration of the endpoint-corrected Hilbert Transform
Authors: Eike Osmers, Dorothea Kolossa
Abstract: Accurate, low-latency estimates of the instantaneous phase of oscillations are essential for closed-loop sensing and actuation, including (but not limited to) phase-locked neurostimulation and other real-time applications. The endpoint-corrected Hilbert transform (ecHT) reduces boundary artefacts of the Hilbert transform by applying a causal narrow-band filter to the analytic spectrum. This improves the phase estimate at the most recent sample. Despite its widespread empirical use, the systematic endpoint distortions of ecHT have lacked a principled, closed-form analysis. In this study, we derive the ecHT endpoint operator analytically and demonstrate that its output can be decomposed into a desired positive-frequency term (a deterministic complex gain that induces a calibratable amplitude/phase bias) and a residual leakage term setting an irreducible variance floor. This yields (i) an explicit characterisation and bounds for endpoint phase/amplitude error, (ii) a mean-squared-error-optimal scalar calibration (c-ecHT), and (iii) practical design rules relating window length, bandwidth/order, and centre-frequency mismatch to residual bias via an endpoint group delay. The resulting calibrated ecHT achieves near-zero mean phase error and remains computationally compatible with real-time pipelines. Code and analyses are provided at this https URL.

Title: SHARE: A Fully Unsupervised Framework for Single Hyperspectral Image Restoration
Authors: Jiangwei Xie, Zhang Wen, Mike Davies, Dongdong Chen
Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration is a fundamental challenge in computational imaging and computer vision. It involves ill-posed inverse problems, such as inpainting and super-resolution. Although deep learning methods have transformed the field through data-driven learning, their effectiveness hinges on access to meticulously curated ground-truth datasets. This fundamentally restricts their applicability in real-world scenarios where such data is unavailable. This paper presents SHARE (Single Hyperspectral Image Restoration with Equivariance), a fully unsupervised framework that unifies geometric equivariance principles with low-rank spectral modelling to eliminate the need for ground truth. SHARE's core concept is to exploit the intrinsic invariance of hyperspectral structures under differentiable geometric transformations (e.g. rotations and scaling) to derive self-supervision signals through equivariance consistency constraints. Our novel Dynamic Adaptive Spectral Attention (DASA) module further enhances this paradigm shift by explicitly encoding the global low-rank property of HSI and adaptively refining local spectral-spatial correlations through learnable attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on HSI inpainting and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of SHARE. Our method outperforms many state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches and achieves performance comparable to that of supervised methods. We hope that our approach will shed new light on HSI restoration and broader scientific imaging scenarios. The code will be released at this https URL.

Title: Achieving Full Multipath Diversity by Random Constellation Rotation: a Theoretical Perspective
Authors: Xuehan Wang, Jinhong Yuan, Jintao Wang, Kehan Huang
Abstract: Diversity is an essential concept associated with communication reliability in multipath channels since it determines the slope of bit error rate performance in the medium to high signal-to-noise ratio regions. However, most of the existing analytical frameworks were developed for specific modulation schemes while the efficient validation of full multipath diversity for general modulation schemes remains an open problem. To fill this research gap, we propose to utilize random constellation rotation to ease the conditions for full-diversity modulation designs. For linearly precoded cyclic-prefix orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, we prove that maximum multipath diversity can be attained as long as the spread matrix does not have zero entries, which is a sufficient but easily satisfied condition. Furthermore, we derive the sufficient and necessary condition for general modulation schemes, whose verification can be divided into validation tasks for each column of the modulation matrix. Based on the proposed conditions, maximum diversity order can be attained with the probability of 1 by enabling a randomly generated rotation pattern for both time and doubly dispersive channels. The theoretical analysis in this paper also demonstrates that the diversity evaluation can be concentrated on the pairwise error probability when the number of error symbols is one, which reduces the complexity of diversity-driven design and performance analysis for novel modulation schemes significantly in both time and doubly dispersive channels. Finally, numerical results for various modulation schemes confirm that the theoretical analysis holds in both time and doubly dispersive channels. Furthermore, when employing practical detectors, the random constellation rotation technique consistently enhance the transmission reliability for both coded and uncoded systems.

Title: DAME: Duration-Aware Matryoshka Embedding for Duration-Robust Speaker Verification
Authors: Youngmoon Jung, Joon-Young Yang, Ju-ho Kim, Jaeyoung Roh, Chang Woo Han, Hoon-Young Cho
Abstract: Short-utterance speaker verification remains challenging due to limited speaker-discriminative cues in short speech segments. While existing methods focus on enhancing speaker encoders, the embedding learning strategy still forces a single fixed-dimensional representation reused for utterances of any length, leaving capacity misaligned with the information available at different durations. We propose Duration-Aware Matryoshka Embedding (DAME), a model-agnostic framework that builds a nested hierarchy of sub-embeddings aligned to utterance durations: lower-dimensional representations capture compact speaker traits from short utterances, while higher dimensions encode richer details from longer speech. DAME supports both training from scratch and fine-tuning, and serves as a direct alternative to conventional large-margin fine-tuning, consistently improving performance across durations. On the VoxCeleb1-O/E/H and VOiCES evaluation sets, DAME consistently reduces the equal error rate on 1-s and other short-duration trials, while maintaining full-length performance with no additional inference cost. These gains generalize across various speaker encoder architectures under both general training and fine-tuning setups.

Title: MATE: Matryoshka Audio-Text Embeddings for Open-Vocabulary Keyword Spotting
Authors: Youngmoon Jung, Myunghun Jung, Joon-Young Yang, Yong-Hyeok Lee, Jaeyoung Roh, Hoon-Young Cho
Abstract: Open-vocabulary keyword spotting (KWS) with text-based enrollment has emerged as a flexible alternative to fixed-phrase triggers. Prior utterance-level matching methods, from an embedding-learning standpoint, learn embeddings at a single fixed dimensionality. We depart from this design and propose Matryoshka Audio-Text Embeddings (MATE), a dual-encoder framework that encodes multiple embedding granularities within a single vector via nested sub-embeddings ("prefixes"). Specifically, we introduce a PCA-guided prefix alignment: PCA-compressed versions of the full text embedding for each prefix size serve as teacher targets to align both audio and text prefixes. This alignment concentrates salient keyword cues in lower-dimensional prefixes, while higher dimensions add detail. MATE is trained with standard deep metric learning objectives for audio-text KWS, and is loss-agnostic. To our knowledge, this is the first application of matryoshka-style embeddings to KWS, achieving state-of-the-art results on WSJ and LibriPhrase without any inference overhead.

Title: Background Subtraction with Drift Correction for Bistatic Radar Reflectivity Measurements
Authors: Alexander Ihlow, Marius Schmidt, Carsten Andrich, Reiner S. Thomä
Abstract: Fundamental research on bistatic radar reflectivity is highly relevant, e.g., to the upcoming mobile communication standard 6G, which includes integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). We introduce a model for correcting instrumentation drift during bistatic radar measurements in anechoic chambers. Usually, background subtraction is applied with the goal to yield the target reflection signal as best as possible while coherently subtracting all signals which were present in both the foreground and background measurement. However, even slight incoherences between the foreground and background measurement process deteriorate the result. We analyze these effects in real measurements in the frequency range 2-18 GHz, taken with the Bistatic Radar (BIRA) measurement facility at TU Ilmenau. Applying our proposed drift correction model, we demonstrate up to 40 dB improvement for the removal of direct line-of-sight antenna crosstalk over the state of the art.

Title: Data-Driven Safe Output Regulation of Strict-Feedback Linear Systems with Input Delay
Authors: Zhenxu Zhao, Ji Wang, Weiyao Lan
Abstract: This paper develops a data-driven safe control framework for linear systems possessing a known strict-feedback structure, but with most plant parameters, external disturbances, and input delay being unknown. By leveraging Koopman operator theory, we utilize Krylov dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to extract the system dynamics from measured data, enabling the reconstruction of the system and disturbance matrices. Concurrently, the batch least-squares identification (BaLSI) method is employed to identify other unknown parameters in the input channel. Using control barrier functions (CBFs) and backstepping, we first develop a full-state safe controller. Based on this, we build an output-feedback controller by performing system identification using only the output data and actuation signals as well as constructing an observer to estimate the unmeasured plant states. The proposed approach achieves: 1) finite-time identification of a substantial set of unknown system quantities, and 2) exponential convergence of the output state (the state furthest from the control input) to a reference trajectory while rigorously ensuring safety constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a safe vehicle platooning application.

Title: A flexible language model-assisted electronic design automation framework
Authors: Cristian Sestito, Panagiota Kontou, Pratibha Verma, Atish Dixit, Alexandros D. Keros, Michael O'Boyle, Christos-Savvas Bouganis, Themis Prodromakis
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming electronic design automation (EDA) by enhancing design stages such as schematic design, simulation, netlist synthesis, and place-and-route. Existing methods primarily focus these optimisations within isolated open-source EDA tools and often lack the flexibility to handle multiple domains, such as analogue, digital, and radio-frequency design. In contrast, modern systems require to interface with commercial EDA environments, adhere to tool-specific operation rules, and incorporate feedback from design outcomes while supporting diverse design flows. We propose a versatile framework that uses LLMs to generate files compatible with commercial EDA tools and optimise designs using power-performance-area reports. This is accomplished by guiding the LLMs with tool constraints and feedback from design outputs to meet tool requirements and user specifications. Case studies on operational transconductance amplifiers, microstrip patch antennas, and FPGA circuits show that the framework is effective as an EDA-aware assistant, handling diverse design challenges reliably.

Title: The Impact of Interference Cognition on the Reliability and Capacity of Industrial Wireless Communications
Authors: Yichen Guo, Tao Peng, Yujie Zhao, Yijing Niu, Wenbo Wang
Abstract: Interference significantly impacts the performance of industrial wireless networks, particularly n severe interference environments with dense networks reusing spectrum resources intensively. Although delicate interference information is often unavailable in conventional networks, emerging interference cognition techniques can compensate this critical problem with possibly different precision. This paper investigates the relationship between precision of interference cognition and system performance. We propose a novel performance analysis framework that quantifies the impact of varying interference information precision on achievable rate. Specifically, leveraging the Nakagami-$\mathbf{m}$ fading channel model, we analytically and asymptotically analyze the average achievable rate in the finite blocklength regime for different precision levels of signal and interference information. Our findings reveal the critical importance of identifying per-link interference information for achieving optimal performance. Additionally, obtaining instantaneous information is more beneficial for signal links.

Title: Bit-Efficient Quantisation for Two-Channel Modulo-Sampling Systems
Authors: Wenyi Yan, Zeyuan Li, Lu Gan, Honqing Liu, Guoquan Li
Abstract: Two-channel modulo analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) enable high-dynamic-range signal sensing at the Nyquist rate per channel, but existing designs quantise both channel outputs independently, incurring redundant bitrate costs. This paper proposes a bit-efficient quantisation scheme that exploits the integer-valued structure of inter-channel differences, transmitting one quantised channel output together with a compact difference index. We prove that this approach requires only 1-2 bits per signal sample overhead relative to conventional ADCs, despite operating with a much smaller per-channel dynamic range. Simulations confirm the theoretical error bounds and bitrate analysis, while hardware experiments demonstrate substantial bitrate savings compared with existing modulo sampling schemes, while maintaining comparable reconstruction accuracy. These results highlight a practical path towards high-resolution, bandwidth-efficient modulo ADCs for bitrate-constrained systems.

Title: Burst Aware Forecasting of User Traffic Demand in LEO Satellite Networks
Authors: Yekta Demirci, Guillaume Mantelet, Stephane Martel, Jean-Francois Frigon, Gunes Karabulut Kurt
Abstract: In Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks, Beam Hopping (BH) technology enables the efficient utilization of limited radio resources by adapting to varying user demands and link conditions. Effective BH planning requires prior knowledge of upcoming traffic at the time of scheduling, making forecasting an important sub-task. Forecasting becomes particularly critical under heavy load conditions where an unexpected demand burst combined with link degradation may cause buffer overflows and packet loss. To address this challenge, we propose a burst aware forecasting solution. This challenge may arise in a wide range of wireless networks; therefore, the proposed solution is broadly applicable to settings characterized by bursty traffic patterns where accurate demand forecasting is essential. Our approach introduces three key enhancements to a transformer architecture: (i) a distance from the last burst embedding to capture burst proximity, (ii) two additional linear layers in the decoder to forecast both upcoming bursts and their relative impact, and (iii) use of an asymmetric cost function during model training to better capture burst dynamics. Empirical evaluations in an Earth-fixed cell under high-traffic demand scenario demonstrate that the proposed model reduces prediction error by up to 94% at a one-step horizon and maintains the ability to accurately capture bursts even near the end of longer prediction horizons following Mean Square Error (MSE) metric.

Title: LRC-DHVC: Towards Local Rate Control in Neural Video Compression
Authors: Marc Windsheimer, Simon Deniffel, André Kaup
Abstract: Local rate control is a key enabler to generalize image and video compression for dedicated challenges, such as video coding for machines. While traditional hybrid video coding can easily adapt the local rate-distortion trade-off by changing the local quantization parameter, no such approach is currently available for learning-based video compression. In this paper, we propose LRC-DHVC, a hierarchical video compression network, which allows continuous local rate control on a pixel level to vary the spatial quality distribution within individual video frames. This is achieved by concatenating a quality map to the input frame and applying a weighted MSE loss which matches the pixelwise trade-off factors in the quality map. During training, the model sees a variety of quality maps due to a constrained-random generation. Our model is the first neural video compression network, which can continuously and spatially adapt to varying quality constraints. Due to the wide quality and bit rate range, a single set of network parameters is sufficient. Compared to single rate point networks, which scale linearly with the number of rate points, the memory requirements for our network parameters remain constant. The code and model are available at link-updated-upon-acceptance.

Title: Robust Localization in OFDM-Based Massive MIMO through Phase Offset Calibration
Authors: Qing Zhang, Adham Sakhnini, Robbert Beerten, Haoqiu Xiong, Zhuangzhuang Cui, Yang Miao, Sofie Pollin
Abstract: Accurate localization in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)-based massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems depends critically on phase coherence across subcarriers and antennas. However, practical systems suffer from frequency-dependent and (spatial) antenna-dependent phase offsets, degrading localization accuracy. This paper analytically studies the impact of phase incoherence on localization performance under a static User Equipment (UE) and Line-of-Sight (LoS) scenario. We use two complementary tools. First, we derive the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) to quantify the theoretical limits under phase offsets. Then, we develop a Spatial Ambiguity Function (SAF)-based model to characterize ambiguity patterns. Simulation results reveal that spatial phase offsets severely degrade localization performance, while frequency phase offsets have a minor effect in the considered system configuration. To address this, we propose a robust Channel State Information (CSI) calibration framework and validate it using real-world measurements from a practical massive MIMO testbed. The experimental results confirm that the proposed calibration framework significantly improves the localization Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) from 5 m to 1.2 cm, aligning well with the theoretical predictions.

Title: WenetSpeech-Wu: Datasets, Benchmarks, and Models for a Unified Chinese Wu Dialect Speech Processing Ecosystem
Authors: Chengyou Wang, Mingchen Shao, Jingbin Hu, Zeyu Zhu, Hongfei Xue, Bingshen Mu, Xin Xu, Xingyi Duan, Binbin Zhang, Pengcheng Zhu, Chuang Ding, Xiaojun Zhang, Hui Bu, Lei Xie
Abstract: Speech processing for low-resource dialects remains a fundamental challenge in developing inclusive and robust speech technologies. Despite its linguistic significance and large speaker population, the Wu dialect of Chinese has long been hindered by the lack of large-scale speech data, standardized evaluation benchmarks, and publicly available models. In this work, we present WenetSpeech-Wu, the first large-scale, multi-dimensionally annotated open-source speech corpus for the Wu dialect, comprising approximately 8,000 hours of diverse speech data. Building upon this dataset, we introduce WenetSpeech-Wu-Bench, the first standardized and publicly accessible benchmark for systematic evaluation of Wu dialect speech processing, covering automatic speech recognition (ASR), Wu-to-Mandarin translation, speaker attribute prediction, speech emotion recognition, text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, and instruction-following TTS (instruct TTS). Furthermore, we release a suite of strong open-source models trained on WenetSpeech-Wu, establishing competitive performance across multiple tasks and empirically validating the effectiveness of the proposed dataset. Together, these contributions lay the foundation for a comprehensive Wu dialect speech processing ecosystem, and we open-source proposed datasets, benchmarks, and models to support future research on dialectal speech intelligence.

Title: CSyMR: Benchmarking Compositional Symbolic Muisc Reasoning With MIR Tool Integration
Authors: Boyang Wang, Yash Vishe, Xin Xu, Zachary Novack, Julian McAuley, Junda Wu
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are leveraged in symbolic music reasoning, yet existing benchmarks emphasize isolated knowledge or atomic analyses rather than the integrative compositional reasoning needed to connect musical structures. To address this, we present the Compositional Symbolic Music Reasoning Benchmark (CSyMR-Bench), a curated multiple-choice dataset of 126 questions derived from expert forums and professional examinations. Each item involves combining several atomic analyses to arrive at the final answer. Furthermore, we introduce a tool-augmented agent framework that leverages symbolic music analysis tools from the music21 library to address the challenges posed by CSyMR-Bench. Experiments validate that CSyMR-Bench poses a non-trivial challenge across both community-sourced and exam-style questions, while our tool-augmented agent consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving 5-7% absolute accuracy gains.

Title: PSSF: Early osteoarthritis detection using physical synthetic knee X-ray scans and AI radiomics models
Authors: Abbas Alzubaidi, Ali Al-Bayaty
Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a major cause of disability worldwide and is still largely assessed using subjective radiographic grading, most commonly the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) scale. Artificial intelligence (AI) and radiomics offer quantitative tools for OA assessment but depend on large, well-annotated image datasets, mainly X-ray scans, that are often difficult to obtain because of privacy, governance and resourcing constraints. In this research, we introduce a physics-based synthetic simulation framework (PSSF) to fully generate controllable X-ray scans without patients' involvement and violating their privacy and institutional constraints. This PSSF is a 2D X-ray projection simulator of anteroposterior knee radiographs from a parametric anatomical model of the distal femur and proximal tibia. Using PSSF, we create a virtual cohort of 180 subjects (260 knees), each is imaged under three protocols (reference, low-dose, and geometry-shift). Medial joint regions are automatically localized, preprocessed, and processed with the Image Biomarker Standardisation Initiative (IBSI). Practically, three machine learning (ML) models are utilized, logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting, to train binary (KL-like "0" vs. "2") and three-class (0-2) prediction radiographic images. Robustness is assessed within IBSI protocol, cross-protocol, and multi-protocol scenarios. Finally, features stability is then evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients across acquisition changes.

Title: From Everything-is-a-File to Files-Are-All-You-Need: How Unix Philosophy Informs the Design of Agentic AI Systems
Authors: Deepak Babu Piskala
Abstract: A core abstraction in early Unix systems was the principle that 'everything is a file', enabling heterogeneous devices and kernel resources to be manipulated via uniform read/write interfaces. This paper explores how an analogous unification is emerging in contemporary agentic AI. We trace the evolution from Unix to DevOps, Infrastructure-as-Code, and finally autonomous software agents, highlighting how file-like abstractions and code-based specifications collapse diverse resources into consistent, composable interfaces. The resulting perspective suggests that adopting file- and code-centric interaction models may enable agentic systems that are more maintainable, auditable, and operationally robust.

Title: Age-Based Scheduling for a Memory-Constrained Quantum Switch
Authors: Stavros Mitrolaris, Subhankar Banerjee, Sennur Ulukus
Abstract: In a time-slotted system, we study the problem of scheduling multipartite entanglement requests in a quantum switch with a finite number of quantum memory registers. Specifically, we consider probabilistic link-level entanglement (LLE) generation for each user, probabilistic entanglement swapping, and one-slot decoherence. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheduling policies, we introduce a novel age-based metric, coined age of entanglement establishment (AoEE). We consider two families of low-complexity policies for which we obtain closed-form expressions for their corresponding AoEE performance. Optimizing over each family, we obtain two policies. Further, we propose one more low-complexity policy and provide its performance guarantee. Finally, we numerically compare the performance of the proposed policies.

Title: Optimal Thruster Configuration for 6-DOF Control of a Small Satellite
Authors: Suguru Sato, Jinaykumar Patel, Kamesh Subbarao
Abstract: With the growing deployment of small satellites (such as CubeSats, Nanosats, Picosats, and Femtosats) in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) for targeted applications like imaging, communication, data storage, and rendezvous-docking mission, there is increasing attention on orbit maintenance and attitude control. A common approach for active orbit control involves the use of multiple thrusters, which, when properly arranged, can also generate the required torque for attitude control. Starting from a 24-thruster configuration, this paper presents a set of thruster configurations (referred to as a viable configuration group) that enable full six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) control. Further, configuration group that requires minimum total thrust to achieve 6-DOF commands are found among the viable configuration group. One configuration from each of these groups is further evaluated for its attitude control performance through a representative rendezvous-docking mission, demonstrating that even with a reduced thruster count, sufficient maneuverability can be achieved.

Title: MixFlow: Mixture-Conditioned Flow Matching for Out-of-Distribution Generalization
Authors: Andrea Rubbi, Amir Akbarnejad, Mohammad Vali Sanian, Aryan Yazdan Parast, Hesam Asadollahzadeh, Arian Amani, Naveed Akhtar, Sarah Cooper, Andrew Bassett, Pietro Liò, Lassi Paavolainen, Sattar Vakili, Mo Lotfollahi
Abstract: Achieving robust generalization under distribution shift remains a central challenge in conditional generative modeling, as existing conditional flow-based methods often struggle to extrapolate beyond the training conditions. We introduce MixFlow, a conditional flow-matching framework for descriptor-controlled generation that directly targets this limitation by jointly learning a descriptor-conditioned base distribution and a descriptor-conditioned flow field via shortest-path flow matching. By modeling the base distribution as a learnable, descriptor-dependent mixture, MixFlow enables smooth interpolation and extrapolation to unseen conditions, leading to substantially improved out-of-distribution generalization. We provide analytical insights into the behavior of the proposed framework and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple domains, including prediction of responses to unseen perturbations in single-cell transcriptomic data and high-content microscopy-based drug screening tasks. Across these diverse settings, MixFlow consistently outperforms standard conditional flow-matching baselines. Overall, MixFlow offers a simple yet powerful approach for achieving robust, generalizable, and controllable generative modeling across heterogeneous domains.

Title: Three Dimensional Hydrodynamic Flow-Based Collision Avoidance for UAV Formations Facing Emergent Dynamic Obstacles
Authors: Suguru Sato, Kamesh Subbarao
Abstract: This paper presents a three-dimensional, hydrodynamics-inspired collision avoidance framework for uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) formations operating in dynamic environments. When moving obstacles enter a UAV's sensing region, they are modeled as three dimensional doublets or ellipsoids that generate local velocity fields, guiding nearby UAVs to execute smooth, collision-free maneuvers without trajectory discontinuities or explicit trajectory replanning. This flow-based approach enables real-time operation and interpretable behavior by leveraging the nature of fluid flow around obstacles via the harmonic properties of Laplace's equation, inherently avoiding local minima common in traditional potential field methods. To establish and maintain coordination among the UAVs, a Virtual Rigid Body (VRB) formation strategy is integrated, ensuring that formation geometry and trajectory tracking are preserved. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of the method for both individual and multi-UAV scenarios with multiple formation geometries encountering moving obstacles. The proposed approach achieves safe, smooth, and computationally efficient avoidance maneuvers suitable for real-time and practical applications.

Title: Karhunen-Loève Expansion-Based Residual Anomaly Map for Resource-Efficient Glioma MRI Segmentation
Authors: Anthony Hur
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors is essential for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Deep learning is currently the state-of-the-art for brain tumor segmentation, yet it requires either large datasets or extensive computational resources that are inaccessible in most areas. This makes the problem increasingly difficult: state-of-the-art models use thousands of training cases and vast computational power, where performance drops sharply when either is limited. The top performer in the Brats GLI 2023 competition relied on supercomputers trained on over 92,000 augmented MRI scans using an AMD EPYC 7402 CPU, six NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPUs (48GB VRAM each), and 1024GB of RAM over multiple weeks. To address this, the Karhunen--Loève Expansion (KLE) was implemented as a feature extraction step on downsampled, z-score normalized MRI volumes. Each 240$\times$240$\times$155 multi-modal scan is reduced to four $48^3$ channels and compressed into 32 KL coefficients. The resulting approximate reconstruction enables a residual-based anomaly map, which is upsampled and added as a fifth channel to a compact 3D U-Net. All experiments were run on a consumer workstation (AMD Ryzen 5 7600X CPU, RTX 4060Ti (8GB VRAM), and 64GB RAM while using far fewer training cases. This model achieves post-processed Dice scores of 0.929 (WT), 0.856 (TC), and 0.821 (ET), with HD95 distances of 2.93, 6.78, and 10.35 voxels. These results are significantly better than the winning BraTS 2023 methodology for HD95 distances and WT dice scores. This demonstrates that a KLE-based residual anomaly map can dramatically reduce computational cost and data requirements while retaining state-of-the-art performance.

Title: The Third VoicePrivacy Challenge: Preserving Emotional Expressiveness and Linguistic Content in Voice Anonymization
Authors: Natalia Tomashenko, Xiaoxiao Miao, Pierre Champion, Sarina Meyer, Michele Panariello, Xin Wang, Nicholas Evans, Emmanuel Vincent, Junichi Yamagishi, Massimiliano Todisco
Abstract: We present results and analyses from the third VoicePrivacy Challenge held in 2024, which focuses on advancing voice anonymization technologies. The task was to develop a voice anonymization system for speech data that conceals a speaker's voice identity while preserving linguistic content and emotional state. We provide a systematic overview of the challenge framework, including detailed descriptions of the anonymization task and datasets used for both system development and evaluation. We outline the attack model and objective evaluation metrics for assessing privacy protection (concealing speaker voice identity) and utility (content and emotional state preservation). We describe six baseline anonymization systems and summarize the innovative approaches developed by challenge participants. Finally, we provide key insights and observations to guide the design of future VoicePrivacy challenges and identify promising directions for voice anonymization research.

Title: AI for Green Spaces: Leveraging Autonomous Navigation and Computer Vision for Park Litter Removal
Authors: Christopher Kao, Akhil Pathapati, James Davis
Abstract: There are 50 billion pieces of litter in the U.S. alone. Grass fields contribute to this problem because picnickers tend to leave trash on the field. We propose building a robot that can autonomously navigate, identify, and pick up trash in parks. To autonomously navigate the park, we used a Spanning Tree Coverage (STC) algorithm to generate a coverage path the robot could follow. To navigate this path, we successfully used Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS, which provides a centimeter-level reading every second. For computer vision, we utilized the ResNet50 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which detects trash with 94.52% accuracy. For trash pickup, we tested multiple design concepts. We select a new pickup mechanism that specifically targets the trash we encounter on the field. Our solution achieved an overall success rate of 80%, demonstrating that autonomous trash pickup robots on grass fields are a viable solution.

Title: Indoor Occupancy Classification using a Compact Hybrid Quantum-Classical Model Enabled by a Physics-Informed Radar Digital Twin
Authors: Sebastian Ratto, Ahmed N. Sayed, Neda Rojhani, Arien P. Sligar, Jose R. Rosas-Bustos, Saasha Joshi, Luke C. G. Govia, Omar M. Ramahi, George Shaker
Abstract: Indoor occupancy classification enables privacy-preserving monitoring in settings such as remote elder care, where presence information helps triage alarms without cameras or wearables. Radar suits this role by sensing motion through occlusions and in darkness. Modern deep-learning pipelines are the standard for interpreting radar returns effectively; however, they are often parameter-heavy and sensitive at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), motivating compact alternatives like Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs). A two-qubit HQNN is benchmarked against convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using a physics-informed 60GHz digital twin and real radar measurements under matched training protocols. In clean conditions, the HQNN achieves high accuracy (99.7% synthetic; 97.0% real) with up to 170x fewer parameters (0.066M). Its parameter efficiency is shown to be structural, as an ablation of the parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) causes sharp performance drops on real data (to 68.5% and 31.5% for the control heads). A domain-dependent sensitivity emerges under additive-noise evaluation, where the HQNN begins recovery earlier in synthetic data while CNNs recover more steeply and peak higher on real measurements. In label-fraction ablations, CNNs prove more sample-efficient on real Range-Doppler Maps (RDMs), with the performance gap being most pronounced (at 50% labels, BA 0.89-0.99 vs. HQNN 0.75). On synthetic data, this gap narrows significantly, largely vanishing by the 50% label mark. Overall, the HQNN's value lies in parameter efficiency and a compact inductive bias that shapes its distinct sensitivity profile; this work establishes a rigorous baseline for hybrid quantum models in privacy-preserving radar occupancy sensing.

Title: MuseAgent-1: Interactive Grounded Multimodal Understanding of Music Scores and Performance Audio
Authors: Qihao Zhao, Yunqi Cao, Yangyu Huang, Hui Yi Leong, Fan Zhang, Kim-Hui Yap, Wei Hu
Abstract: Despite recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their ability to understand and interact with music remains limited. Music understanding requires grounded reasoning over symbolic scores and expressive performance audio, which general-purpose MLLMs often fail to handle due to insufficient perceptual grounding. We introduce MuseAgent, a music-centric multimodal agent that augments language models with structured symbolic representations derived from sheet music images and performance audio. By integrating optical music recognition and automatic music transcription modules, MuseAgent enables multi-step reasoning and interaction over fine-grained musical content. To systematically evaluate music understanding capabilities, we further propose MuseBench, a benchmark covering music theory reasoning, score interpretation, and performance-level analysis across text, image, and audio modalities. Experiments show that existing MLLMs perform poorly on these tasks, while MuseAgent achieves substantial improvements, highlighting the importance of structured multimodal grounding for interactive music understanding.

Title: Kernel-Based Learning of Safety Barriers
Authors: Oliver Schön, Zhengang Zhong, Sadegh Soudjani
Abstract: The rapid integration of AI algorithms in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and healthcare is raising significant concerns about the ability to meet stringent safety standards. Traditional tools for formal safety verification struggle with the black-box nature of AI-driven systems and lack the flexibility needed to scale to the complexity of real-world applications. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach for safety verification and synthesis of black-box systems with discrete-time stochastic dynamics. We employ the concept of control barrier certificates, which can guarantee safety of the system, and learn the certificate directly from a set of system trajectories. We use conditional mean embeddings to embed data from the system into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and construct an RKHS ambiguity set that can be inflated to robustify the result to out-of-distribution behavior. We provide the theoretical results on how to apply the approach to general classes of temporal logic specifications beyond safety. For the data-driven computation of safety barriers, we leverage a finite Fourier expansion to cast a typically intractable semi-infinite optimization problem as a linear program. The resulting spectral barrier allows us to leverage the fast Fourier transform to generate the relaxed problem efficiently, offering a scalable yet distributionally robust framework for verifying safety. Our work moves beyond restrictive assumptions on system dynamics and uncertainty, as demonstrated on two case studies including a black-box system with a neural network controller.

Title: Robust Verification of Concurrent Stochastic Games
Authors: Angel Y. He, David Parker
Abstract: Autonomous systems often operate in multi-agent settings and need to make concurrent, strategic decisions, typically in uncertain environments. Verification and control problems for these systems can be tackled with concurrent stochastic games (CSGs), but this model requires transition probabilities to be precisely specified - an unrealistic requirement in many real-world settings. We introduce *robust CSGs* and their subclass *interval CSGs* (ICSGs), which capture epistemic uncertainty about transition probabilities in CSGs. We propose a novel framework for *robust* verification of these models under worst-case assumptions about transition uncertainty. Specifically, we develop the underlying theoretical foundations and efficient algorithms, for finite- and infinite-horizon objectives in both zero-sum and nonzero-sum settings, the latter based on (social-welfare optimal) Nash equilibria. We build an implementation in the PRISM-games model checker and demonstrate the feasibility of robust verification of ICSGs across a selection of large benchmarks.

Title: Multimodal Feedback for Handheld Tool Guidance: Combining Wrist-Based Haptics with Augmented Reality
Authors: Yue Yang, Christoph Leuze, Brian Hargreaves, Bruce Daniel, Fred M Baik
Abstract: We investigate how vibrotactile wrist feedback can enhance spatial guidance for handheld tool movement in optical see-through augmented reality (AR). While AR overlays are widely used to support surgical tasks, visual occlusion, lighting conditions, and interface ambiguity can compromise precision and confidence. To address these challenges, we designed a multimodal system combining AR visuals with a custom wrist-worn haptic device delivering directional and state-based cues. A formative study with experienced surgeons and residents identified key tool maneuvers and preferences for reference mappings, guiding our cue design. In a cue identification experiment (N=21), participants accurately recognized five vibration patterns under visual load, with higher recognition for full-actuator states than spatial direction cues. In a guidance task (N=27), participants using both AR and haptics achieved significantly higher spatial precision (5.8 mm) and usability (SUS = 88.1) than those using either modality alone, despite having modest increases in task time. Participants reported that haptic cues provided reassuring confirmation and reduced cognitive effort during alignment. Our results highlight the promise of integrating wrist-based haptics into AR systems for high-precision, visually complex tasks such as surgical guidance. We discuss design implications for multimodal interfaces supporting confident, efficient tool manipulation.

Title: VidTune: Creating Video Soundtracks with Generative Music and Contextual Thumbnails
Authors: Mina Huh, Ailie C. Fraser, Dingzeyu Li, Mira Dontcheva, Bryan Wang
Abstract: Music shapes the tone of videos, yet creators often struggle to find soundtracks that match their video's mood and narrative. Recent text-to-music models let creators generate music from text prompts, but our formative study (N=8) shows creators struggle to construct diverse prompts, quickly review and compare tracks, and understand their impact on the video. We present VidTune, a system that supports soundtrack creation by generating diverse music options from a creator's prompt and producing contextual thumbnails for rapid review. VidTune extracts representative video subjects to ground thumbnails in context, maps each track's valence and energy onto visual cues like color and brightness, and depicts prominent genres and instruments. Creators can refine tracks through natural language edits, which VidTune expands into new generations. In a controlled user study (N=12) and an exploratory case study (N=6), participants found VidTune helpful for efficiently reviewing and comparing music options and described the process as playful and enriching.

Title: Do Neural Codecs Generalize? A Controlled Study Across Unseen Languages and Non-Speech Tasks
Authors: Shih-Heng Wang, Jiatong Shi, Jinchuan Tian, Haibin Wu, Shinji Watanabe
Abstract: This paper investigates three crucial yet underexplored aspects of the generalization capabilities of neural audio codecs (NACs): (i) whether NACs can generalize to unseen languages during pre-training, (ii) whether speech-only pre-trained NACs can effectively generalize to non-speech applications such as environmental sounds, music, and animal vocalizations, and (iii) whether incorporating non-speech data during pre-training can improve performance on both speech and non-speech tasks. Existing studies typically rely on off-the-shelf NACs for comparison, which limits insight due to variations in implementation. In this work, we train NACs from scratch using strictly controlled configurations and carefully curated pre-training data to enable fair comparisons. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of NAC performance on both signal reconstruction quality and downstream applications using 11 metrics. Our results show that NACs can generalize to unseen languages during pre-training, speech-only pre-trained NACs exhibit degraded performance on non-speech tasks, and incorporating non-speech data during pre-training improves performance on non-speech tasks while maintaining comparable performance on speech tasks.

Title: Song Aesthetics Evaluation with Multi-Stem Attention and Hierarchical Uncertainty Modeling
Authors: Yishan Lv, Jing Luo, Boyuan Ju, Yang Zhang, Xinda Wu, Bo Yuan, Xinyu Yang
Abstract: Music generative artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly expanding music content, necessitating automated song aesthetics evaluation. However, existing studies largely focus on speech, audio or singing quality, leaving song aesthetics underexplored. Moreover, conventional approaches often predict a precise Mean Opinion Score (MOS) value directly, which struggles to capture the nuances of human perception in song aesthetics evaluation. This paper proposes a song-oriented aesthetics evaluation framework, featuring two novel modules: 1) Multi-Stem Attention Fusion (MSAF) builds bidirectional cross-attention between mixture-vocal and mixture-accompaniment pairs, fusing them to capture complex musical features; 2) Hierarchical Granularity-Aware Interval Aggregation (HiGIA) learns multi-granularity score probability distributions, aggregates them into a score interval, and applies a regression within the interval to produce the final score. We evaluated on two datasets of full-length songs: SongEval dataset (AI-generated) and an internal aesthetics dataset (human-created), and compared with two state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Results show that the proposed method achieves stronger performance for multi-dimensional song aesthetics evaluation.

Title: Sound2Hap: Learning Audio-to-Vibrotactile Haptic Generation from Human Ratings
Authors: Yinan Li, Hasti Seifi
Abstract: Environmental sounds like footsteps, keyboard typing, or dog barking carry rich information and emotional context, making them valuable for designing haptics in user applications. Existing audio-to-vibration methods, however, rely on signal-processing rules tuned for music or games and often fail to generalize across diverse sounds. To address this, we first investigated user perception of four existing audio-to-haptic algorithms, then created a data-driven model for environmental sounds. In Study 1, 34 participants rated vibrations generated by the four algorithms for 1,000 sounds, revealing no consistent algorithm preferences. Using this dataset, we trained Sound2Hap, a CNN-based autoencoder, to generate perceptually meaningful vibrations from diverse sounds with low latency. In Study 2, 15 participants rated its output higher than signal-processing baselines on both audio-vibration match and Haptic Experience Index (HXI), finding it more harmonious with diverse sounds. This work demonstrates a perceptually validated approach to audio-haptic translation, broadening the reach of sound-driven haptics.

Title: Confidence-based Filtering for Speech Dataset Curation with Generative Speech Enhancement Using Discrete Tokens
Authors: Kazuki Yamauchi, Masato Murata, Shogo Seki
Abstract: Generative speech enhancement (GSE) models show great promise in producing high-quality clean speech from noisy inputs, enabling applications such as curating noisy text-to-speech (TTS) datasets into high-quality ones. However, GSE models are prone to hallucination errors, such as phoneme omissions and speaker inconsistency, which conventional error filtering based on non-intrusive speech quality metrics often fails to detect. To address this issue, we propose a non-intrusive method for filtering hallucination errors from discrete token-based GSE models. Our method leverages the log-probabilities of generated tokens as confidence scores to detect potential errors. Experimental results show that the confidence scores strongly correlate with a suite of intrusive SE metrics, and that our method effectively identifies hallucination errors missed by conventional filtering methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical utility of our method: curating an in-the-wild TTS dataset with our confidence-based filtering improves the performance of subsequently trained TTS models.

Title: ParaMETA: Towards Learning Disentangled Paralinguistic Speaking Styles Representations from Speech
Authors: Haowei Lou, Hye-young Paik, Wen Hu, Lina Yao
Abstract: Learning representative embeddings for different types of speaking styles, such as emotion, age, and gender, is critical for both recognition tasks (e.g., cognitive computing and human-computer interaction) and generative tasks (e.g., style-controllable speech generation). In this work, we introduce ParaMETA, a unified and flexible framework for learning and controlling speaking styles directly from speech. Unlike existing methods that rely on single-task models or cross-modal alignment, ParaMETA learns disentangled, task-specific embeddings by projecting speech into dedicated subspaces for each type of style. This design reduces inter-task interference, mitigates negative transfer, and allows a single model to handle multiple paralinguistic tasks such as emotion, gender, age, and language classification. Beyond recognition, ParaMETA enables fine-grained style control in Text-To-Speech (TTS) generative models. It supports both speech- and text-based prompting and allows users to modify one speaking styles while preserving others. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ParaMETA outperforms strong baselines in classification accuracy and generates more natural and expressive speech, while maintaining a lightweight and efficient model suitable for real-world applications.

Title: A Unified Neural Codec Language Model for Selective Editable Text to Speech Generation
Authors: Hanchen Pei, Shujie Liu, Yanqing Liu, Jianwei Yu, Yuanhang Qian, Gongping Huang, Sheng Zhao, Yan Lu
Abstract: Neural codec language models achieve impressive zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) by fully imitating the acoustic characteristics of a short speech prompt, including timbre, prosody, and paralinguistic information. However, such holistic imitation limits their ability to isolate and control individual attributes. In this paper, we present a unified codec language model SpeechEdit that extends zero-shot TTS with a selective control mechanism. By default, SpeechEdit reproduces the complete acoustic profile inferred from the speech prompt, but it selectively overrides only the attributes specified by explicit control instructions. To enable controllable modeling, SpeechEdit is trained on our newly constructed LibriEdit dataset, which provides delta (difference-aware) training pairs derived from LibriHeavy. Experimental results show that our approach maintains naturalness and robustness while offering flexible and localized control over desired attributes. Audio samples are available at this https URL.

Abstract: Audio large language models (LLMs) enable unified speech understanding and generation, yet their adaptation to linguistically complex, dialect-rich settings remains underexplored. This paper presents the first systematic study of multi-task instruction tuning for an Arabic-centric audio LLM, covering a hierarchy of generative tasks (ASR, speech summarization) and discriminative tasks (dialect and emotion identification). To support this study, we introduce AraMega-SSum, a novel dataset for Arabic speech summarization. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Omni (7B) and propose Task-Progressive Curriculum (TPC) along with Aligner-Based Diverse Sampling (ADS), a strategy that constructs information-dense batches by selecting task- and label-balanced examples. Our results reveal a critical efficiency, robustness trade-off: while ADS accelerates initial convergence and boosts paralinguistic F1-scores, its inherent gradient volatility can destabilize generative decoding under prolonged training. Furthermore, while the TPC stabilizes core acoustic mapping, it often induces negative transfer in downstream tasks. We demonstrate that a Hybrid TPC+ADS Strategy provides an optimal training ``recipe'', first establishing a robust representative foundation before employing diversity-aware refinement to capture fine-grained nuances. These findings offer practical guidance for the efficient adaptation of Omni-models in complex, low-resource multimodal environments.

Title: SmoothCLAP: Soft-Target Enhanced Contrastive Language\--Audio Pretraining for Affective Computing
Authors: Xin Jing, Jiadong Wang, Andreas Triantafyllopoulos, Maurice Gerczuk, Shahin Amiriparian, Jun Luo, Björn Schuller
Abstract: The ambiguity of human emotions poses several challenges for machine learning models, as they often overlap and lack clear delineating boundaries. Contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) has emerged as a key technique for generalisable emotion recognition. However, as conventional CLAP enforces a strict one-to-one alignment between paired audio-text samples, it overlooks intra-modal similarity and treats all non-matching pairs as equally negative. This conflicts with the fuzzy boundaries between different emotions. To address this limitation, we propose SmoothCLAP, which introduces softened targets derived from intra-modal similarity and paralinguistic features. By combining these softened targets with conventional contrastive supervision, SmoothCLAP learns embeddings that respect graded emotional relationships, while retaining the same inference pipeline as CLAP. Experiments on eight affective computing tasks across English and German demonstrate that SmoothCLAP is consistently achieving superior performance. Our results highlight that leveraging soft supervision is a promising strategy for building emotion-aware audio-text models.

Title: SSVD-O: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning with Structured SVD for Speech Recognition
Authors: Pu Wang, Shinji Watanabe, Hugo Van hamme
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is a scalable approach for adapting large speech foundation models to new domains. While methods such as LoRA and its state-of-the-art variants reduce adaptation costs, they typically allocate parameters uniformly across model subspaces, which limits their efficiency and scalability in speech applications. Building on our prior work, this paper introduces SSVD-Outer (SSVD-O), an extension of the structured SVD-guided (SSVD) fine-tuning method. SSVD-O combines input acoustic feature space-associated inner transformations with output semantic feature space-associated outer transformations to enable scalable and balanced adaptation. We conduct the first systematic analysis of parameter budget allocation across model subspaces in PEFT for automatic speech recognition (ASR), and investigate the trade-off between learning and forgetting under constrained resources. SSVD-O is benchmarked against LoRA, DoRA, PiSSA, and SSVD on domain-shifted ASR tasks, including child speech and regional accents, across model scales from 0.1B to 2B within the ESPnet framework. Experimental results show that SSVD-O consistently narrows the performance gap to full fine-tuning while improving generalization and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Title: Toward Faithful Explanations in Acoustic Anomaly Detection
Authors: Maab Elrashid, Anthony Deschênes, Cem Subakan, Mirco Ravanelli, Rémi Georges, Michael Morin
Abstract: Interpretability is essential for user trust in real-world anomaly detection applications. However, deep learning models, despite their strong performance, often lack transparency. In this work, we study the interpretability of autoencoder-based models for audio anomaly detection, by comparing a standard autoencoder (AE) with a mask autoencoder (MAE) in terms of detection performance and interpretability. We applied several attribution methods, including error maps, saliency maps, SmoothGrad, Integrated Gradients, GradSHAP, and Grad-CAM. Although MAE shows a slightly lower detection, it consistently provides more faithful and temporally precise explanations, suggesting a better alignment with true anomalies. To assess the relevance of the regions highlighted by the explanation method, we propose a perturbation-based faithfulness metric that replaces them with their reconstructions to simulate normal input. Our findings, based on experiments in a real industrial scenario, highlight the importance of incorporating interpretability into anomaly detection pipelines and show that masked training improves explanation quality without compromising performance.

Title: Decentralized Learning Strategies for Estimation Error Minimization with Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Xingran Chen, Navid NaderiAlizadeh, Alejandro Ribeiro, Shirin Saeedi Bidokhti
Abstract: We address real-time sampling and estimation of autoregressive Markovian sources in dynamic yet structurally similar multi-hop wireless networks. Each node caches samples from others and communicates over wireless collision channels, aiming to minimize time-average estimation error via decentralized policies. Due to the high dimensionality of action spaces and complexity of network topologies, deriving optimal policies analytically is intractable. To address this, we propose a graphical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for policy optimization. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our proposed policies are transferable, allowing a policy trained on one graph to be effectively applied to structurally similar graphs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that (i) our proposed policy outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; (ii) the trained policies are transferable to larger networks, with performance gains increasing with the number of agents; (iii) the graphical training procedure withstands non-stationarity, even when using independent learning techniques; and (iv) recurrence is pivotal in both independent learning and centralized training and decentralized execution, and improves the resilience to non-stationarity.

Title: GaussianTrimmer: Online Trimming Boundaries for 3DGS Segmentation
Authors: Liwei Liao, Ronggang Wang
Abstract: With the widespread application of 3D Gaussians in 3D scene representation, 3D scene segmentation methods based on 3D Gaussians have also gradually emerged. However, existing 3D Gaussian segmentation methods basically segment on the basis of Gaussian primitives. Due to the large variation range of the scale of 3D Gaussians, large-sized Gaussians that often span the foreground and background lead to jagged boundaries of segmented objects. To this end, we propose an online boundary trimming method, GaussianTrimmer, which is an efficient and plug-and-play post-processing method capable of trimming coarse boundaries for existing 3D Gaussian segmentation methods. Our method consists of two core steps: 1. Generating uniformly and well-covered virtual cameras; 2. Trimming Gaussian at the primitive level based on 2D segmentation results on virtual cameras. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method can improve the segmentation quality of existing 3D Gaussian segmentation methods as a plug-and-play method.

Title: Resource-Conscious RL Algorithms for Deep Brain Stimulation
Authors: Arkaprava Gupta, Nicholas Carter, William Zellers, Prateek Ganguli, Benedikt Dietrich, Vibhor Krishna, Parasara Sridhar Duggirala, Samarjit Chakraborty
Abstract: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has proven to be a promising treatment of Parkinson's Disease (PD). DBS involves stimulating specific regions of the brain's Basal Ganglia (BG) using electric impulses to alleviate symptoms of PD such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Although most clinical DBS approaches today use a fixed frequency and amplitude, they suffer from side effects (such as slurring of speech) and shortened battery life of the implant. Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been used in recent research to perform DBS in a more adaptive manner to improve overall patient outcome. These RL algorithms are, however, too complex to be trained in vivo due to their long convergence time and requirement of high computational resources. We propose a new Time & Threshold-Triggered Multi-Armed Bandit (T3P MAB) RL approach for DBS that is more effective than existing algorithms. Further, our T3P agent is lightweight enough to be deployed in the implant, unlike current deep-RL strategies, and even forgoes the need for an offline training phase. Additionally, most existing RL approaches have focused on modulating only frequency or amplitude, and the possibility of tuning them together remains greatly unexplored in the literature. Our RL agent can tune both frequency and amplitude of DBS signals to the brain with better sample efficiency and requires minimal time to converge. We implement an MAB agent for DBS for the first time on hardware to report energy measurements and prove its suitability for resource-constrained platforms. Our T3P MAB algorithm is deployed on a variety of microcontroller unit (MCU) setups to show its efficiency in terms of power consumption as opposed to other existing RL approaches used in recent work.

Title: Spatial-VLN: Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation With Explicit Spatial Perception and Exploration
Authors: Lu Yue, Yue Fan, Shiwei Lian, Yu Zhao, Jiaxin Yu, Liang Xie, Feitian Zhang
Abstract: Zero-shot Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in generalization but suffer from insufficient spatial perception. Focusing on complex continuous environments, we categorize key perceptual bottlenecks into three spatial challenges: door interaction,multi-room navigation, and ambiguous instruction execution, where existing methods consistently suffer high failure rates. We present Spatial-VLN, a perception-guided exploration framework designed to overcome these challenges. The framework consists of two main modules. The Spatial Perception Enhancement (SPE) module integrates panoramic filtering with specialized door and region experts to produce spatially coherent, cross-view consistent perceptual representations. Building on this foundation, our Explored Multi-expert Reasoning (EMR) module uses parallel LLM experts to address waypoint-level semantics and region-level spatial transitions. When discrepancies arise between expert predictions, a query-and-explore mechanism is activated, prompting the agent to actively probe critical areas and resolve perceptual ambiguities. Experiments on VLN-CE demonstrate that Spatial VLN achieves state-of-the-art performance using only low-cost LLMs. Furthermore, to validate real-world applicability, we introduce a value-based waypoint sampling strategy that effectively bridges the Sim2Real gap. Extensive real-world evaluations confirm that our framework delivers superior generalization and robustness in complex environments. Our codes and videos are available at this https URL.

Title: UNMIXX: Untangling Highly Correlated Singing Voices Mixtures
Authors: Jihoo Jung, Ji-Hoon Kim, Doyeop Kwak, Junwon Lee, Juhan Nam, Joon Son Chung
Abstract: We introduce UNMIXX, a novel framework for multiple singing voices separation (MSVS). While related to speech separation, MSVS faces unique challenges: data scarcity and the highly correlated nature of singing voices mixture. To address these issues, we propose UNMIXX with three key components: (1) musically informed mixing strategy to construct highly correlated, music-like mixtures, (2) cross-source attention that drives representations of two singers apart via reverse attention, and (3) magnitude penalty loss penalizing erroneously assigned interfering energy. UNMIXX not only addresses data scarcity by simulating realistic training data, but also excels at separating highly correlated mixtures through cross-source interactions at both the architectural and loss levels. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that UNMIXX greatly enhances performance, with SDRi gains exceeding 2.2 dB over prior work.

Title: Active Inference-Driven World Modeling for Adaptive UAV Swarm Trajectory Design
Authors: Kaleem Arshid, Ali Krayani, Lucio Marcenaro, David Martin Gomez, Carlo Regazzoni
Abstract: This paper proposes an Active Inference-based framework for autonomous trajectory design in UAV swarms. The method integrates probabilistic reasoning and self-learning to enable distributed mission allocation, route ordering, and motion planning. Expert trajectories generated using a Genetic Algorithm with Repulsion Forces (GA-RF) are employed to train a hierarchical World Model capturing swarm behavior across mission, route, and motion levels. During online operation, UAVs infer actions by minimizing divergence between current beliefs and model-predicted states, enabling adaptive responses to dynamic environments. Simulation results show faster convergence, higher stability, and safer navigation than Q-Learning, demonstrating the scalability and cognitive grounding of the proposed framework for intelligent UAV swarm control.

Title: Imitation learning-based spacecraft rendezvous and docking method with Expert Demonstration
Authors: Shibo Shao, Dong Zhou, Guanghui Sun, Liwen Zhang, Mingxuan Jiang
Abstract: Existing spacecraft rendezvous and docking control methods largely rely on predefined dynamic models and often exhibit limited robustness in realistic on-orbit environments. To address this issue, this paper proposes an Imitation Learning-based spacecraft rendezvous and docking control framework (IL-SRD) that directly learns control policies from expert demonstrations, thereby reducing dependence on accurate modeling. We propose an anchored decoder target mechanism, which conditions the decoder queries on state-related anchors to explicitly constrain the control generation process. This mechanism enforces physically consistent control evolution and effectively suppresses implausible action deviations in sequential prediction, enabling reliable six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) rendezvous and docking control. To further enhance stability, a temporal aggregation mechanism is incorporated to mitigate error accumulation caused by the sequential prediction nature of Transformer-based models, where small inaccuracies at each time step can propagate and amplify over long horizons. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed IL-SRD framework achieves accurate and energy-efficient model-free rendezvous and docking control. Robustness evaluations further confirm its capability to maintain competitive performance under significant unknown disturbances. The source code is available at this https URL.

Title: Exploiting Light To Enhance The Endurance and Navigation of Lighter-Than-Air Micro-Drones
Authors: Harry Huang, Talia Xu, Marco Zúñiga Zamalloa
Abstract: Micro-Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are rapidly expanding into tasks from inventory to environmental sensing, yet their short endurance and unreliable navigation in GPS-denied spaces limit deployment. Lighter-Than-Air (LTA) drones offer an energy-efficient alternative: they use a helium envelope to provide buoyancy, which enables near-zero-power drain during hovering and much longer operation. LTAs are promising, but their design is complex, and they lack integrated solutions to enable sustained autonomous operations and navigation with simple, low-infrastructure. We propose a compact, self-sustaining LTA drone that uses light for both energy harvesting and navigation. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a high-fidelity simulation framework to analyze LTA aerodynamics and select a stable, efficient configuration; (ii) a framework to integrate solar cells on the envelope to provide net-positive energy; and (iii) a point-and-go navigation system with three light-seeking algorithms operating on a single light beacon. Our LTA-analysis, together with the integrated solar panels, not only saves energy while flying, but also enables sustainable operation: providing 1 minute of flying time for every 4 minutes of energy harvesting, under illuminations of 80klux. We also demonstrate robust single-beacon navigation towards a light source that can be up to 7m away, in indoor and outdoor environments, even with moderate winds. The resulting system indicates a plausible path toward persistent, autonomous operation for indoor and outdoor monitoring. More broadly, this work provides a practical pathway for translating the promise of LTA drones into a persistent, self-sustaining aerial system.

Title: IntAgent: NWDAF-Based Intent LLM Agent Towards Advanced Next Generation Networks
Authors: Abdelrahman Soliman, Ahmed Refaey, Aiman Erbad, Amr Mohamed
Abstract: Intent-based networks (IBNs) are gaining prominence as an innovative technology that automates network operations through high-level request statements, defining what the network should achieve. In this work, we introduce IntAgent, an intelligent intent LLM agent that integrates NWDAF analytics and tools to fulfill the network operator's intents. Unlike previous approaches, we develop an intent tools engine directly within the NWDAF analytics engine, allowing our agent to utilize live network analytics to inform its reasoning and tool selection. We offer an enriched, 3GPP-compliant data source that enhances the dynamic, context-aware fulfillment of network operator goals, along with an MCP tools server for scheduling, monitoring, and analytics tools. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework through two practical use cases: ML-based traffic prediction and scheduled policy enforcement, which validate IntAgent's ability to autonomously fulfill complex network intents.

Title: Modelling viable supply networks with cooperative adaptive financing
Authors: Yaniv Proselkov, Liming Xu, Alexandra Brintrup
Abstract: We propose a financial liquidity policy sharing method for firm-to-firm supply networks, introducing a scalable autonomous control function for viable complex adaptive supply networks. Cooperation and competition in supply chains is reconciled through overlapping collaborative sets, making firms interdependent and enabling distributed risk governance. How cooperative range - visibility - affects viability is studied using dynamic complex adaptive systems modelling. We find that viability needs cooperation; visibility and viability grow together in scale-free supply networks; and distributed control, where firms only have limited partner information, outperforms centralised control. This suggests that policy toward network viability should implement distributed supply chain financial governance, supporting interfirm collaboration, to enable autonomous control.

Title: An AMP-Based Asymptotic Analysis For Nonlinear One-Bit Precoding
Authors: Zheyu Wu, Junjie Ma, Ya-Feng Liu, Bruno Clerckx
Abstract: This paper focuses on the asymptotic analysis of a class of nonlinear one-bit precoding schemes under Rayleigh fading channels. The considered scheme employs a convex-relaxation-then-quantization (CRQ) approach to the well-known minimum mean square error (MMSE) model, which includes the classical one-bit precoder SQUID as a special case. To analyze its asymptotic behavior, we develop a novel analytical framework based on approximate message passing (AMP). We show that, the statistical properties of the considered scheme can be asymptotically characterized by a scalar ``signal plus Gaussian noise'' model. Based on this, we further derive a closed-form expression for the symbol error probability (SEP) in the large-system limit, which quantitatively characterizes the impact of both system and model parameters on SEP performance. Simulation results validate our analysis and also demonstrate that performance gains over SQUID can be achieved by appropriately tuning the parameters involved in the considered model.

Title: Autonomous Navigation at the Nano-Scale: Algorithms, Architectures, and Constraints
Authors: Mahmud S. Zango, Jianglin Lan
Abstract: Autonomous navigation for nano-scale unmanned aerial vehicles (nano-UAVs) is governed by extreme Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constraints (with the weight < 50 g and sub-100 mW onboard processor), distinguishing it fundamentally from standard robotic paradigms. This review synthesizes the state-of-the-art in sensing, computing, and control architectures designed specifically for these sub- 100mW computational envelopes. We critically analyse the transition from classical geometry-based methods to emerging "Edge AI" paradigms, including quantized deep neural networks deployed on ultra-low-power System-on-Chips (SoCs) and neuromorphic event-based control. Beyond algorithms, we evaluate the hardware-software co-design requisite for autonomy, covering advancements in dense optical flow, optimized Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), and learning-based flight control. While significant progress has been observed in visual navigation and relative pose estimation, our analysis reveals persistent gaps in long-term endurance, robust obstacle avoidance in dynamic environments, and the "Sim-to-Real" transfer of reinforcement learning policies. This survey provides a roadmap for bridging these gaps, advocating for hybrid architectures that fuse lightweight classical control with data-driven perception to enable fully autonomous, agile nano-UAVs in GPS-denied environments.

Title: On the Relation of State Space Models and Hidden Markov Models
Authors: Aydin Ghojogh, M.Hadi Sepanj, Benyamin Ghojogh
Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are foundational frameworks for modeling sequential data with latent variables and are widely used in signal processing, control theory, and machine learning. Despite their shared temporal structure, they differ fundamentally in the nature of their latent states, probabilistic assumptions, inference procedures, and training paradigms. Recently, deterministic state space models have re-emerged in natural language processing through architectures such as S4 and Mamba, raising new questions about the relationship between classical probabilistic SSMs, HMMs, and modern neural sequence models. In this paper, we present a unified and systematic comparison of HMMs, linear Gaussian state space models, Kalman filtering, and contemporary NLP state space models. We analyze their formulations through the lens of probabilistic graphical models, examine their inference algorithms -- including forward-backward inference and Kalman filtering -- and contrast their learning procedures via Expectation-Maximization and gradient-based optimization. By highlighting both structural similarities and semantic differences, we clarify when these models are equivalent, when they fundamentally diverge, and how modern NLP SSMs relate to classical probabilistic models. Our analysis bridges perspectives from control theory, probabilistic modeling, and modern deep learning.

Title: Leveraging Transformer Decoder for Automotive Radar Object Detection
Authors: Changxu Zhang, Zhaoze Wang, Tai Fei, Christopher Grimm, Yi Jin, Claas Tebruegge, Ernst Warsitz, Markus Gardill
Abstract: In this paper, we present a Transformer-based architecture for 3D radar object detection that uses a novel Transformer Decoder as the prediction head to directly regress 3D bounding boxes and class scores from radar feature representations. To bridge multi-scale radar features and the decoder, we propose Pyramid Token Fusion (PTF), a lightweight module that converts a feature pyramid into a unified, scale-aware token sequence. By formulating detection as a set prediction problem with learnable object queries and positional encodings, our design models long-range spatial-temporal correlations and cross-feature interactions. This approach eliminates dense proposal generation and heuristic post-processing such as extensive non-maximum suppression (NMS) tuning. We evaluate the proposed framework on the RADDet, where it achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art radar-only baselines.

Title: Distribution-Free Confidence Ellipsoids for Ridge Regression with PAC Bounds
Authors: Szabolcs Szentpéteri, Balázs Csanád Csáji
Abstract: Linearly parametrized models are widely used in control and signal processing, with the least-squares (LS) estimate being the archetypical solution. When the input is insufficiently exciting, the LS problem may be unsolvable or numerically unstable. This issue can be resolved through regularization, typically with ridge regression. Although regularized estimators reduce the variance error, it remains important to quantify their estimation uncertainty. A possible approach for linear regression is to construct confidence ellipsoids with the Sign-Perturbed Sums (SPS) ellipsoidal outer approximation (EOA) algorithm. The SPS EOA builds non-asymptotic confidence ellipsoids under the assumption that the noises are independent and symmetric about zero. This paper introduces an extension of the SPS EOA algorithm to ridge regression, and derives probably approximately correct (PAC) upper bounds for the resulting region sizes. Compared with previous analyses, our result explicitly show how the regularization parameter affects the region sizes, and provide tighter bounds under weaker excitation assumptions. Finally, the practical effect of regularization is also demonstrated via simulation experiments.

Title: Event Classification by Physics-informed Inpainting for Distributed Multichannel Acoustic Sensor with Partially Degraded Channels
Authors: Noriyuki Tonami, Wataru Kohno, Yoshiyuki Yajima, Sakiko Mishima, Yumi Arai, Reishi Kondo, Tomoyuki Hino
Abstract: Distributed multichannel acoustic sensing (DMAS) enables large-scale sound event classification (SEC), but performance drops when many channels are degraded and when sensor layouts at test time differ from training layouts. We propose a learning-free, physics-informed inpainting frontend based on reverse time migration (RTM). In this approach, observed multichannel spectrograms are first back-propagated on a 3D grid using an analytic Green's function to form a scene-consistent image, and then forward-projected to reconstruct inpainted signals before log-mel feature extraction and Transformer-based classification. We evaluate the method on ESC-50 with 50 sensors and three layouts (circular, linear, right-angle), where per-channel SNRs are sampled from -30 to 0 dB. Compared with an AST baseline, scaling-sparsemax channel selection, and channel-swap augmentation, the proposed RTM frontend achieves the best or competitive accuracy across all layouts, improving accuracy by 13.1 points on the right-angle layout (from 9.7% to 22.8%). Correlation analyses show that spatial weights align more strongly with SNR than with channel--source distance, and that higher SNR--weight correlation corresponds to higher SEC accuracy. These results demonstrate that a reconstruct-then-project, physics-based preprocessing effectively complements learning-only methods for DMAS under layout-open configurations and severe channel degradation.

Title: Learning Fine-Grained Correspondence with Cross-Perspective Perception for Open-Vocabulary 6D Object Pose Estimation
Authors: Yu Qin, Shimeng Fan, Fan Yang, Zixuan Xue, Zijie Mai, Wenrui Chen, Kailun Yang, Zhiyong Li
Abstract: Open-vocabulary 6D object pose estimation empowers robots to manipulate arbitrary unseen objects guided solely by natural language. However, a critical limitation of existing approaches is their reliance on unconstrained global matching strategies. In open-world scenarios, trying to match anchor features against the entire query image space introduces excessive ambiguity, as target features are easily confused with background distractors. To resolve this, we propose Fine-grained Correspondence Pose Estimation (FiCoP), a framework that transitions from noise-prone global matching to spatially-constrained patch-level correspondence. Our core innovation lies in leveraging a patch-to-patch correlation matrix as a structural prior to narrowing the matching scope, effectively filtering out irrelevant clutter to prevent it from degrading pose estimation. Firstly, we introduce an object-centric disentanglement preprocessing to isolate the semantic target from environmental noise. Secondly, a Cross-Perspective Global Perception (CPGP) module is proposed to fuse dual-view features, establishing structural consensus through explicit context reasoning. Finally, we design a Patch Correlation Predictor (PCP) that generates a precise block-wise association map, acting as a spatial filter to enforce fine-grained, noise-resilient matching. Experiments on the REAL275 and Toyota-Light datasets demonstrate that FiCoP improves Average Recall by 8.0% and 6.1%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art method, highlighting its capability to deliver robust and generalized perception for robotic agents operating in complex, unconstrained open-world environments.

Title: Control policies for a two-stage queueing system with parallel and single server options
Authors: Shuwen Lu, Jamol Pender, Mark E. Lewis
Abstract: We study a two-stage tandem service queue attended by two servers. Each job-server pair must complete both service phases together, with the server unable to begin a new job until the current one is fully processed after two stages. Immediately after the first phase of service, the server decides whether to send the job/customer to a downstream station that allows parallel processing or to a single-service facility that offers faster or higher-quality service but handles only one job at a time. This choice determines whether the second phase commences immediately or (potentially) after waiting in a queue for the single-service facility to become available. The decision-making scenario is modeled via a Markov decision process formulation, of a clearing system with holding costs at each station. We fully characterize the structural properties of an optimal control policy based on the relationship between the service rates at the downstream stations. A numerical study highlights the significance of optimal control by comparing its performance against several natural heuristic policies.

Title: Balancing Independent and Collaborative Service
Authors: Shuwen Lu, Mark E. Lewis, Jamol Pender
Abstract: We study a two-type server queueing system where flexible Type-I servers, upon their initial interaction with jobs, decide in real time whether to process them independently or in collaboration with dedicated Type-II servers. Independent processing begins immediately, as does collaborative service if a Type-II server is available. Otherwise, the job and its paired Type-I server wait in queue for collaboration. Type-I servers are non-preemptive and cannot engage with new jobs until their current job is completed. We provide a complete characterization of the structural properties of the optimal policy for the clearing system. In particular, an optimal control is shown to follow a threshold structure based on the number of jobs in the queue before a Type-I first interaction and on the number of jobs in either independent or collaborative service. We propose simple threshold heuristics, based on linear approximations, for real-time decision-making. In much of the parameter and state spaces, we establish theoretical bounds that compare the thresholds proposed by our heuristics to those of optimal policies and identify parameter configurations where these bounds are attained. Outside of these regions, the optimal thresholds are infinite. Numerical experiments further demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our heuristics, particularly when the initial queue length is high. Our proposed heuristics achieve costs within 0.5% of the optimal policy on average and significantly outperform benchmark policies that exhibit extreme sensitivity to system parameters, sometimes incurring costs exceeding 100% of the optimal.

Title: Correction of Pooling Matrix Mis-specifications in Compressed Sensing Based Group Testing
Authors: Shuvayan Banerjee, Radhendushka Srivastava, James Saunderson, Ajit Rajwade
Abstract: Compressed sensing, which involves the reconstruction of sparse signals from an under-determined linear system, has been recently used to solve problems in group testing. In a public health context, group testing aims to determine the health status values of p subjects from n<<p pooled tests, where a pool is defined as a mixture of small, equal-volume portions of the samples of a subset of subjects. This approach saves on the number of tests administered in pandemics or other resource-constrained scenarios. In practical group testing in time-constrained situations, a technician can inadvertently make a small number of errors during pool preparation, which leads to errors in the pooling matrix, which we term `model mismatch errors' (MMEs). This poses difficulties while determining health status values of the participating subjects from the results on n<<p pooled tests. In this paper, we present an algorithm to correct the MMEs in the pooled tests directly from the pooled results and the available (inaccurate) pooling matrix. Our approach then reconstructs the signal vector from the corrected pooling matrix, in order to determine the health status of the subjects. We further provide theoretical guarantees for the correction of the MMEs and the reconstruction error from the corrected pooling matrix. We also provide several supporting numerical results.

Title: Distributed Coverage Control on Poriferous Surface via Poly-Annulus Conformal Mapping
Authors: Xun Feng, Chao Zhai
Abstract: The inherent non-convexity of poriferous surfaces typically entraps agents in local minima and complicates workload distribution. To resolve this, we propose a distributed diffeomorphic coverage control framework for the multi-agent system (MAS) in such surfaces. First, we establish a distributed poly-annulus conformal mapping that transforms arbitrary poriferous surfaces into a multi-hole disk. Leveraging this topological equivalence, a collision-free sectorial partition mechanism is designed in the multi-hole disk, which rigorously induces strictly connected subregions and workload balance on the poriferous surfaces. This mechanism utilizes a buffer-based sequence mechanism to ensure strict topological safety when bypassing obstacles. Furthermore, a pull-back Riemannian metric is constructed to define the length metric that encodes safety constraints. Based on this metric, a distributed gradient-based control law is synthesized to drive agents toward optimal configurations, ensuring simultaneous obstacle avoidance and coverage optimization. Theoretical analyses guarantee the Input-to-State Stability (ISS) of the partition dynamics and the asymptotic convergence of the closed-loop system. Numerical simulations confirm the reachability and robustness of the proposed coverage algorithm, offering a scalable solution for distributed coverage in poriferous surfaces.

Title: Performance and Complexity Trade-off Optimization of Speech Models During Training
Authors: Esteban Gómez, Tom Bäckström
Abstract: In speech machine learning, neural network models are typically designed by choosing an architecture with fixed layer sizes and structure. These models are then trained to maximize performance on metrics aligned with the task's objective. While the overall architecture is usually guided by prior knowledge of the task, the sizes of individual layers are often chosen heuristically. However, this approach does not guarantee an optimal trade-off between performance and computational complexity; consequently, post hoc methods such as weight quantization or model pruning are typically employed to reduce computational cost. This occurs because stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods can only optimize differentiable functions, while factors influencing computational complexity, such as layer sizes and floating-point operations per second (FLOP/s), are non-differentiable and require modifying the model structure during training. We propose a reparameterization technique based on feature noise injection that enables joint optimization of performance and computational complexity during training using SGD-based methods. Unlike traditional pruning methods, our approach allows the model size to be dynamically optimized for a target performance-complexity trade-off, without relying on heuristic criteria to select which weights or structures to remove. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through three case studies, including a synthetic example and two practical real-world applications: voice activity detection and audio anti-spoofing. The code related to our work is publicly available to encourage further research.

Title: RIM Hand : A Robotic Hand with an Accurate Carpometacarpal Joint and Nitinol-Supported Skeletal Structure
Authors: Joon Lee, Jeongyoon Han, Doyoung Kim, Seokhwan Jeong
Abstract: This paper presents the flexible RIM Hand, a biomimetic robotic hand that precisely replicates the carpometacarpal (CMC) joints and employs superelastic Nitinol wires throughout its skeletal framework. By modeling the full carpal-to-metacarpal anatomy, the design enables realistic palm deformation through tendon-driven fingers while enhancing joint restoration and supports skeletal structure with Nitinol-based dorsal extensors. A flexible silicone skin further increases contact friction and contact area, enabling stable grasps for diverse objects. Experiments show that the palm can deform up to 28%, matching human hand flexibility, while achieving more than twice the payload capacity and three times the contact area compared to a rigid palm design. The RIM Hand thus offers improved dexterity, compliance, and anthropomorphism, making it promising for prosthetic and service-robot applications.

Title: A Blockchain-Oriented Software Engineering Architecture for Carbon Credit Certification Systems
Authors: Matteo Vaccargiu, Azmat Ullah, Pierluigi Gallo
Abstract: Carbon credit systems have emerged as a policy tool to incentivize emission reductions and support the transition to clean energy. Reliable carbon-credit certification depends on mechanisms that connect actual, measured renewable-energy production to verifiable emission-reduction records. Although blockchain and IoT technologies have been applied to emission monitoring and trading, existing work offers limited support for certification processes, particularly for small and medium-scale renewable installations. This paper introduces a blockchain-based carbon-credit certification architecture, demonstrated through a 100 kWp photovoltaic case study, that integrates real-time IoT data collection, edge-level aggregation, and secure on-chain storage on a permissioned blockchain with smart contracts. Unlike approaches focused on trading mechanisms, the proposed system aligns with European legislation and voluntary carbon-market standards, clarifying the practical requirements and constraints that apply to photovoltaic operators. The resulting architecture provides a structured pathway for generating verifiable carbon-credit records and supporting third-party verification.

Title: Habibi: Laying the Open-Source Foundation of Unified-Dialectal Arabic Speech Synthesis
Authors: Yushen Chen, Junzhe Liu, Yujie Tu, Zhikang Niu, Yuzhe Liang, Kai Yu, Chunyu Qiang, Chen Zhang, Xie Chen
Abstract: A notable gap persists in speech synthesis research and development for Arabic dialects, particularly from a unified modeling perspective. Despite its high practical value, the inherent linguistic complexity of Arabic dialects, further compounded by a lack of standardized data, benchmarks, and evaluation guidelines, steers researchers toward safer ground. To bridge this divide, we present Habibi, a suite of specialized and unified text-to-speech models that harnesses existing open-source ASR corpora to support a wide range of high- to low-resource Arabic dialects through linguistically-informed curriculum learning. Our approach outperforms the leading commercial service in generation quality, while maintaining extensibility through effective in-context learning, without requiring text diacritization. We are committed to open-sourcing the model, along with creating the first systematic benchmark for multi-dialect Arabic speech synthesis. Furthermore, by identifying the key challenges in and establishing evaluation standards for the process, we aim to provide a solid groundwork for subsequent research. Resources at this https URL .

Title: A Predictive and Preventive Digital Twin Framework for Indoor Wireless Networks
Authors: Jiunn-Tsair Chen
Abstract: Wi-Fi networks increasingly suffer from performance degradation caused by contention-based channel access, dense deployments, and largely self-managed operation among mutually interfering access points (APs). In this paper, we propose a Digital Twin (DT) framework that captures the essential spatial and temporal characteristics of wireless channels and traffic patterns, enabling the prediction of likely future network scenarios while respecting physical constraints. Leveraging this predictive capability, we introduce two analytically derived performance upper bounds-one based on Shannon capacity and the other on latency behavior under CSMA-CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance)-that can be evaluated efficiently without time-consuming network simulations. By applying importance sampling to DT-generated scenarios, potentially risky network conditions can be identified within large stochastic scenario spaces. These same performance bounds are then used to proactively guide a gradient-based search for improved network configurations, with the objective of avoiding imminent performance degradation rather than pursuing globally optimal but fragile solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can successfully predict time-dependent network congestion and mitigate it in advance, highlighting its potential for predictive and preventive Wi-Fi network management.

Title: SCG With Your Phone: Diagnosis of Rhythmic Spectrum Disorders in Field Conditions
Authors: Peter Golenderov, Yaroslav Matushenko, Anastasia Tushina, Michal Barodkin
Abstract: Aortic valve opening (AO) events are crucial for detecting frequency and rhythm disorders, especially in real-world settings where seismocardiography (SCG) signals collected via consumer smartphones are subject to noise, motion artifacts, and variability caused by device heterogeneity. In this work, we present a robust deep-learning framework for SCG segmentation and rhythm analysis using accelerometer recordings obtained with consumer smartphones. We develop an enhanced U-Net v3 architecture that integrates multi-scale convolutions, residual connections, and attention gates, enabling reliable segmentation of noisy SCG signals. A dedicated post-processing pipeline converts probability masks into precise AO timestamps, whereas a novel adaptive 3D-to-1D projection method ensures robustness to arbitrary smartphone orientation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistently high accuracy and robustness across various device types and unsupervised data-collection conditions. Our approach enables practical, low-cost, and automated cardiac-rhythm monitoring using everyday mobile devices, paving the way for scalable, field-deployable cardiovascular assessment and future multimodal diagnostic systems.

Title: Equivariant Learning for Unsupervised Image Dehazing
Authors: Zhang Wen, Jiangwei Xie, Dongdong Chen
Abstract: Image Dehazing (ID) aims to produce a clear image from an observation contaminated by haze. Current ID methods typically rely on carefully crafted priors or extensive haze-free ground truth, both of which are expensive or impractical to acquire, particularly in the context of scientific imaging. We propose a new unsupervised learning framework called Equivariant Image Dehazing (EID) that exploits the symmetry of image signals to restore clarity to hazy observations. By enforcing haze consistency and systematic equivariance, EID can recover clear patterns directly from raw, hazy images. Additionally, we propose an adversarial learning strategy to model unknown haze physics and facilitate EID learning. Experiments on two scientific image dehazing benchmarks (including cell microscopy and medical endoscopy) and on natural image dehazing have demonstrated that EID significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. By unifying equivariant learning with modelling haze physics, we hope that EID will enable more versatile and effective haze removal in scientific imaging. Code and datasets will be published.

Title: LLMOrbit: A Circular Taxonomy of Large Language Models -From Scaling Walls to Agentic AI Systems
Authors: Badri N. Patro, Vijay S. Agneeswaran
Abstract: The field of artificial intelligence has undergone a revolution from foundational Transformer architectures to reasoning-capable systems approaching human-level performance. We present LLMOrbit, a comprehensive circular taxonomy navigating the landscape of large language models spanning 2019-2025. This survey examines over 50 models across 15 organizations through eight interconnected orbital dimensions, documenting architectural innovations, training methodologies, and efficiency patterns defining modern LLMs, generative AI, and agentic systems. We identify three critical crises: (1) data scarcity (9-27T tokens depleted by 2026-2028), (2) exponential cost growth ($3M to $300M+ in 5 years), and (3) unsustainable energy consumption (22x increase), establishing the scaling wall limiting brute-force approaches. Our analysis reveals six paradigms breaking this wall: (1) test-time compute (o1, DeepSeek-R1 achieve GPT-4 performance with 10x inference compute), (2) quantization (4-8x compression), (3) distributed edge computing (10x cost reduction), (4) model merging, (5) efficient training (ORPO reduces memory 50%), and (6) small specialized models (Phi-4 14B matches larger models). Three paradigm shifts emerge: (1) post-training gains (RLHF, GRPO, pure RL contribute substantially, DeepSeek-R1 achieving 79.8% MATH), (2) efficiency revolution (MoE routing 18x efficiency, Multi-head Latent Attention 8x KV cache compression enables GPT-4-level performance at <$0.30/M tokens), and (3) democratization (open-source Llama 3 88.6% MMLU surpasses GPT-4 86.4%). We provide insights into techniques (RLHF, PPO, DPO, GRPO, ORPO), trace evolution from passive generation to tool-using agents (ReAct, RAG, multi-agent systems), and analyze post-training innovations.

Title: Utilizing the Perceived Age to Maximize Freshness in Query-Based Update Systems
Authors: Sahan Liyanaarachchi, Sennur Ulukus, Nail Akar
Abstract: Query-based sampling has become an increasingly popular technique for monitoring Markov sources in pull-based update systems. However, most of the contemporary literature on this assumes an exponential distribution for query delay and often relies on the assumption that the feedback or replies to the queries are instantaneous. In this work, we relax both of these assumptions and find optimal sampling policies for monitoring continuous-time Markov chains (CTMC) under generic delay distributions. In particular, we show that one can obtain significant gains in terms of mean binary freshness (MBF) by employing a waiting based strategy for query-based sampling.

Title: Storage-Rate Trade-off in A-XPIR
Authors: Mohamed Nomeir, Sennur Ulukus
Abstract: We consider the storage problem in an asymmetric $X$-secure private information retrieval (A-XPIR) setting. The A-XPIR setting considers the $X$-secure PIR problem (XPIR) when a given arbitrary set of servers is communicating. We focus on the trade-off region between the average storage at the servers and the average download cost. In the case of $N=4$ servers and two non-overlapping sets of communicating servers with $K=2$ messages, we characterize the achievable region and show that the three main inequalities compared to the no-security case collapse to two inequalities in the asymmetric security case. In the general case, we derive bounds that need to be satisfied for the general achievable region for an arbitrary number of servers and messages. In addition, we provide the storage and retrieval scheme for the case of $N=4$ servers with $K=2$ messages and two non-overlapping sets of communicating servers, such that the messages are not replicated (in the sense of a coded version of each symbol) and at the same time achieve the optimal achievable rate for the case of replication. Finally, we derive the exact capacity for the case of asymmetric security and asymmetric collusion for $N=4$ servers, with the communication links $\{1,2\}$ and $\{3,4\}$, which splits the servers into two groups, i.e., $g=2$, and with the collusion links $\{1,3\}$, $\{2,4\}$, as $C=\frac{1}{3}$. More generally, we derive a capacity result for a certain family of asymmetric collusion and asymmetric security cases.

Title: Topology-Aware Loss for Aorta and Great Vessel Segmentation in Computed Tomography Images
Authors: Seher Ozcelik, Sinan Unver, Ilke Ali Gurses, Rustu Turkay, Cigdem Gunduz-Demir
Abstract: Segmentation networks are not explicitly imposed to learn global invariants of an image, such as the shape of an object and the geometry between multiple objects, when they are trained with a standard loss function. On the other hand, incorporating such invariants into network training may help improve performance for various segmentation tasks when they are the intrinsic characteristics of the objects to be segmented. One example is segmentation of aorta and great vessels in computed tomography (CT) images where vessels are found in a particular geometry in the body due to the human anatomy and they mostly seem as round objects on a 2D CT image. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a new topology-aware loss function that penalizes topology dissimilarities between the ground truth and prediction through persistent homology. Different from the previously suggested segmentation network designs, which apply the threshold filtration on a likelihood function of the prediction map and the Betti numbers of the ground truth, this paper proposes to apply the Vietoris-Rips filtration to obtain persistence diagrams of both ground truth and prediction maps and calculate the dissimilarity with the Wasserstein distance between the corresponding persistence diagrams. The use of this filtration has advantage of modeling shape and geometry at the same time, which may not happen when the threshold filtration is applied. Our experiments on 4327 CT images of 24 subjects reveal that the proposed topology-aware loss function leads to better results than its counterparts, indicating the effectiveness of this use.

Title: Advanced safety filter based on SOS Control Barrier and Lyapunov Functions
Authors: Michael Schneeberger, Silvia Mastellone, Florian Dörfler
Abstract: This paper presents a novel safety filter framework that ensures both safety and the preservation of the legacy control action within a nominal region. This modular design allows the safety filter to be integrated into the control hierarchy without compromising the performance of the existing legacy controller during nominal operation. For a control-affine system, this is accomplished by formulating multiple Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and Control Lyapunov-like Functions (CLFs) conditions, alongside a forward invariance condition for the legacy controller, as sum-of-squares constraints. Additionally, the state-dependent inequality constraints of the resulting Quadratic Program (QP) -- encoding the CBF and CLF conditions -- are designed to remain inactive within the nominal region, ensuring preservation of the legacy control action and performance. Our safety filter design is also the first to include quadratic input constraints, and does not need an explicit specification of the attractor, as it is implicitly defined by the legacy controller. To avoid the chattering effect and guarantee the uniqueness and Lipschitz continuity of solutions, the state-dependent inequality constraints of the Quadratic Program are selected to be regular. Finally, we demonstrate the method in a detailed case study involving the control of a three-phase ac/dc power converter.

Title: Transferable Graphical MARL for Real-Time Estimation in Dynamic Wireless Networks
Authors: Xingran Chen, Navid NaderiAlizadeh, Alejandro Ribeiro, Shirin Saeedi Bidokhti
Abstract: We study real-time sampling and estimation of autoregressive Markovian sources in decentralized and dynamic multi-hop networks that share similar structures. Nodes cache neighboring samples and communicate over wireless collision channels. The objective is to minimize the time-average estimation error and/or the age of information under decentralized policies, which we address by developing a unified graphical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework. A key feature of the framework is its transferability, enabled by the fact that the number of trainable parameters is independent of the number of agents, allowing a learned policy to be directly deployed on dynamic yet structurally similar graphs without re-training. Building on this design, we establish rigorous theoretical guarantees on the transferability of the resulting policies. Numerical experiments demonstrate that (i) our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on dynamic graphs; (ii) the trained policies transfer well to larger networks, with performance gains increasing with the number of nodes; and (iii) incorporating recurrence is crucial, enhancing resilience to non-stationarity in both independent learning and centralized training with decentralized execution.

Title: Barrier Integral Control for Global Asymptotic Tracking of Uncertain Nonlinear Systems under State and Input Constraints
Authors: Christos K. Verginis
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of asymptotic tracking for high-order control-affine MIMO nonlinear systems with unknown dynamic terms subject to input and transient state constraints. We introduce Barrier Integral Control (BRIC), a novel algorithm designed to confine the system's state within a predefined funnel, ensuring adherence to the transient state constraints, and asymptotically drive it to a given reference trajectory from any initial condition. The algorithm leverages the innovative integration of a reciprocal barrier function and error-integral terms, featuring smooth feedback control. We further develop an extension of the algorithm, entailing continuous feedback, that uses a reference-modification technique to account for the input-saturation constraints. Notably, BRIC operates without relying on any information or approximation schemes for the (unknown) dynamic terms, which, unlike a large class of previous works, are not assumed to be bounded or to comply with globally Lipschitz/growth conditions. Additionally, the system's trajectory and asymptotic performance are decoupled from the uncertain model, control-gain selection, and initial conditions. Finally, comparative simulation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Title: Super Monotonic Alignment Search
Authors: Junhyeok Lee, Hyeongju Kim
Abstract: Monotonic alignment search (MAS), introduced by Glow-TTS, is one of the most popular algorithm in text-to-speech to estimate unknown alignments between text and speech. Since this algorithm needs to search for the most probable alignment with dynamic programming by caching all possible paths, the time complexity of the algorithm is $O(T \times S)$, where $T$ is the length of text and $S$ is the length of speech representation. The authors of Glow-TTS run this algorithm on CPU, and while they mentioned it is difficult to parallelize, we found that MAS can be parallelized in text length dimension and CPU execution consumes an inordinate amount of time for inter-device copy. Therefore, we implemented a Triton kernel and PyTorch JIT script to accelerate MAS on GPU without inter-device copy. As a result, Super-MAS Triton kernel is up to 72 times faster in the extreme-length case. The code is available at this https URL.

Title: Emotional Dimension Control in Language Model-Based Text-to-Speech: Spanning a Broad Spectrum of Human Emotions
Authors: Kun Zhou, You Zhang, Dianwen Ng, Shengkui Zhao, Hao Wang, Bin Ma
Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech (TTS) systems sturggle to capture the full spectrum of human emotions due to the inherent complexity of emotional expressions and the limited coverage of existing emotion labels. To address this, we propose a language model-based TTS framework that synthesizes speech across a broad range of emotional styles. Our approach enables flexible user control along three continuous dimensions - pleasure, arousal, and dominance (PAD). To enable this, we train an emotional dimension predictor that maps categorical emotion labels in speech datasets into the PAD space, grounded in established psychological research. Importantly, while the emotional dimension predictor leverages categorical labels, the TTS framework itself does not require explict emotion labels during training. Objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that our framework effectively generates more expressive emotional styles and enhances both naturalness and diversity compared to baselines.

Title: An Adaptive Online Smoother with Closed-Form Solutions and Information-Theoretic Lag Selection for Conditional Gaussian Nonlinear Systems
Authors: Marios Andreou, Nan Chen, Yingda Li
Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) combines partial observations with dynamical models to improve state estimation. Filter-based DA uses only past and present data and is the prerequisite for real-time forecasts. Smoother-based DA exploits both past and future observations. It aims to fill in missing data, provide more accurate estimations, and develop high-quality datasets. However, the standard smoothing procedure requires using all historical state estimations, which is storage-demanding, especially for high-dimensional systems. This paper develops an adaptive-lag online smoother for a large class of complex dynamical systems with strong nonlinear and non-Gaussian features, which has important applications to many real-world problems. The adaptive lag allows the utilization of observations only within a nearby window, thus reducing computational complexity and storage needs. Online lag adjustment is essential for tackling turbulent systems, where temporal autocorrelation varies significantly over time due to intermittency, extreme events, and nonlinearity. Based on the uncertainty reduction in the estimated state, an information criterion is developed to systematically determine the adaptive lag. Notably, the mathematical structure of these systems facilitates the use of closed analytic formulae to calculate the online smoother and adaptive lag, avoiding empirical tunings as in ensemble-based DA methods. The adaptive online smoother is applied to studying three important scientific problems. First, it helps detect online causal relationships between state variables. Second, the advantage of reduced computational storage expenditure is illustrated via Lagrangian DA, a high-dimensional nonlinear problem. Finally, the adaptive smoother advances online parameter estimation with partial observations, emphasizing the role of the observed extreme events in accelerating convergence.

Title: Positioning-Aided Channel Estimation for Multi-LEO Satellite Cooperative Beamforming
Authors: Yuchen Zhang, Pinjun Zheng, Jie Ma, Henk Wymeersch, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri
Abstract: We investigate a multi-low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite system that simultaneously provides positioning and communication services to terrestrial user terminals. To address the challenges of accurately acquiring channel state information in LEO satellite systems, we propose a novel two-timescale positioning-aided channel estimation framework, exploiting the distinct variation rates of position-related parameters and channel gains inherent in LEO satellite channels. Using the misspecified Cramér-Rao bound (MCRB) theory, we systematically analyze positioning performance under practical imperfections, such as inter-satellite clock bias and carrier frequency offset. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate how position information derived from downlink positioning can enhance uplink channel estimation accuracy, even in the presence of positioning errors, through an MCRB-based analysis. To address the limited link budgets and communication rates of single-satellite communication, we develop a multi-LEO cooperative beamforming strategy for downlink transmission that leverages cluster-wise satellite cooperation while maintaining reduced complexity. Theoretical analyses and numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework in facilitating high-precision downlink positioning under practical imperfections, facilitating uplink channel estimation, and enabling efficient downlink communication.

Title: Graph Neural Network for Location- and Orientation-Assisted mmWave Beam Alignment
Authors: Yuzhu Lei, Qiqi Xiao, Yinghui He, Guanding Yu
Abstract: In massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, the main bottlenecks of location- and orientation-assisted beam alignment using deep neural networks (DNNs) are large training overhead and significant performance degradation. This paper proposes a graph neural network (GNN)-based beam selection approach that reduces the training overhead and improves the alignment accuracy, by capitalizing on the strong expressive ability and few trainable parameters of GNN. The channels of beams are correlated according to the beam direction. Therefore, we establish a graph according to the angular correlation between beams and use GNN to capture the channel correlation between adjacent beams, which helps accelerate the learning process and enhance the beam alignment performance. Compared to existing DNN-based algorithms, the proposed method requires only 20\% of the dataset size to achieve equivalent accuracy and improves the Top-1 accuracy by 10\% when using the same dataset.

Title: The 4D Human Embryonic Brain Atlas: spatiotemporal atlas generation for rapid anatomical changes
Authors: Wietske A.P. Bastiaansen, Melek Rousian, Anton H.J. Koning, Wiro J. Niessen, Bernadette S. de Bakker, Régine P.M. Steegers-Theunissen, Stefan Klein
Abstract: Early brain development is crucial for lifelong neurodevelopmental health. However, current clinical practice offers limited knowledge of normal embryonic brain anatomy on ultrasound, despite the brain undergoing rapid changes within the time-span of days. To provide detailed insights into normal brain development and identify deviations, we created the 4D Human Embryonic Brain Atlas using a deep learning-based approach for groupwise registration and spatiotemporal atlas generation. Our method introduced a time-dependent initial atlas and penalized deviations from it, ensuring age-specific anatomy was maintained throughout rapid development. The atlas was generated and validated using 831 3D ultrasound images from 402 subjects in the Rotterdam Periconceptional Cohort, acquired between gestational weeks 8 and 12. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach with an ablation study, which demonstrated that incorporating a time-dependent initial atlas and penalization produced anatomically accurate results. In contrast, omitting these adaptations led to anatomically incorrect atlas. Visual comparisons with an existing ex-vivo embryo atlas further confirmed the anatomical accuracy of our atlas. In conclusion, the proposed method successfully captures the rapid anotomical development of the embryonic brain. The resulting 4D Human Embryonic Brain Atlas provides a unique insights into this crucial early life period and holds the potential for improving the detection, prevention, and treatment of prenatal neurodevelopmental disorders.

Title: The value of hedging against energy storage uncertainties when designing energy parks
Authors: Max Langtry, Ruchi Choudhary
Abstract: Energy storage is needed to match renewable generation to industrial loads in energy parks. However, the future performance of bulk storage technologies is currently highly uncertain. Due to the urgency of decarbonization targets, energy park projects must be designed and begun now. But, as uncertainty in storage performance reduces, a different technology than identified during initial design may turn out cheaper. Enabling flexibility so that design adaptations can be made as better information becomes available would lower the cost of decarbonizing industry. But having this flexibility is itself costly. This raises the question, "Is it worth it?" This study quantifies the benefit of retaining flexibility to adapt energy park designs and optionality over storage technology choice as uncertainty reduces, to determine whether it is economically worthwhile. It applies the Value of Information analysis framework to the sizing of wind, solar, and storage in an illustrative energy park model based on a real-world proposal near Rotterdam, considering uncertainty in storage efficiency, lifetime, and capital cost. Updating asset sizings after storage uncertainty reduced is found to reduce total costs by 18% on average. Having the option to switch storage technology choice as well reduces costs by a further 13%, which is substantially greater than the cost of providing storage optionality. Using two storage technologies in the energy park reduces costs by 14%, and in this case storage optionality is not worthwhile. These results are robust to the level of uncertainty reduction in storage performance, and the risk aversion of the system designer.

Title: Tube-Based Robust Control Strategy for Vision-Guided Autonomous Vehicles
Authors: Der-Hau Lee
Abstract: A robust control strategy for autonomous vehicles can improve system stability, enhance riding comfort, and prevent driving accidents. This paper presents a novel interpolation-tube-based constrained iterative linear quadratic regulator (itube-CILQR) algorithm for autonomous computer-vision-based vehicle lane-keeping. The goal of the algorithm is to enhance robustness during high-speed cornering on tight turns. Compared with standard tube-based approaches, the proposed itube-CILQR algorithm reduces system conservatism and exhibits higher computational speed. Numerical simulations and vision-based experiments were conducted to examine the feasibility of using the proposed algorithm for controlling autonomous vehicles. The results indicated that the proposed algorithm achieved superior vehicle lane-keeping performance to variational CILQR-based methods and model predictive control (MPC) approaches involving the use of a classical interior-point optimizer. Specifically, itube-CILQR required an average runtime of 3.45 ms to generate a control signal for guiding a self-driving vehicle. By comparison, itube-MPC typically required a 4.32 times longer computation time to complete the same task. Moreover, the influence of conservatism on system behavior was investigated by exploring the variations in the interpolation variables derived using the proposed itube-CILQR algorithm during lane-keeping maneuvers.

Title: Robust Channel Estimation for Optical Wireless Communications Using Neural Network
Authors: Dianxin Luan, John Thompson
Abstract: Optical Wireless Communication (OWC) has gained significant attention due to its high-speed data transmission and throughput. Optical wireless channels are often assumed to be flat, but we evaluate frequency selective channels to consider high data rate optical wireless or very dispersive environments. To address this for optical scenarios, this paper presents a robust channel estimation framework with low-complexity to mitigate frequency-selective effects, then to improve system reliability and performance. This channel estimation framework contains a neural network that can estimate general optical wireless channels without prior channel information about the environment. Based on this estimate and the corresponding delay spread, one of several candidate offline-trained neural networks will be activated to predict this channel. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method has improved and robust normalized mean square error (NMSE) and bit error rate (BER) performance compared to conventional estimation methods while maintaining computational efficiency. These findings highlight the potential of neural network solutions in enhancing the performance of OWC systems under indoor channel conditions.

Authors: Di Zhang, Yuanhao Cui, Xiaowen Cao, Nanchi Su, Yi Gong, Fan Liu, Weijie Yuan, Xiaojun Jing, J. Andrew Zhang, Jie Xu, Christos Masouros, Dusit Niyato, Marco Di Renzo
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) enables efficient spectrum utilization and reduces hardware costs for beyond 5G (B5G) and 6G networks, facilitating intelligent applications that require both high-performance communication and precise sensing capabilities. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the evolution of ISAC over the years. We examine the expansion of the spectrum across RF and optical ISAC, highlighting the role of advanced technologies, along with key challenges and synergies. We further discuss the advancements in network architecture from single-cell to multi-cell systems, emphasizing the integration of collaborative sensing and interference mitigation strategies. Moreover, we analyze the progress from single-modal to multi-modal sensing, with a focus on the integration of edge intelligence to enable real-time data processing, reduce latency, and enhance decision-making. Finally, we extensively review standardization efforts by 3GPP, IEEE, and ITU, examining the transition of ISAC-related technologies and their implications for the deployment of 6G networks.

Title: Computationally Efficient Signal Detection with Unknown Bandwidths
Authors: Ali Rasteh, Sundeep Rangan
Abstract: Signal detection in environments with unknown signal bandwidth and time intervals is a fundamental problem in adversarial and spectrum-sharing scenarios. This paper addresses the problem of detecting signals occupying unknown degrees of freedom from non-coherent power measurements, where the signal is constrained to an interval in one dimension or a hyper-cube in multiple dimensions. A GLRT is derived, resulting in a straightforward metric involving normalized average signal energy for each candidate signal set. We present bounds on false alarm and missed detection probabilities, demonstrating their dependence on SNR and signal set sizes. To overcome the inherent computational complexity of exhaustive searches, we propose a computationally efficient binary search method, reducing the complexity from O(N^2) to O(N) for one-dimensional cases. Simulations indicate that the method maintains performance near exhaustive searches and achieves asymptotic consistency, with interval-of-overlap converging to one under constant SNR as measurement size increases. The simulation studies also demonstrate superior performance and reduced complexity compared to contemporary neural network-based approaches, specifically outperforming custom-trained U-Net models in spectrum detection tasks.

Title: Stabilization by Controllers Having Integer Coefficients
Authors: Joowon Lee, Donggil Lee, Junsoo Kim
Abstract: The system property of ``having integer coefficients,'' that is, a transfer function has an integer monic polynomial as its denominator, is significant in the field of encrypted control as it is required for a dynamic controller to be realized over encrypted data. This paper shows that there always exists a controller with integer coefficients stabilizing a given discrete-time linear time-invariant plant. A constructive algorithm to obtain such a controller is provided, along with numerical examples. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to converting a pre-designed controller to have integer coefficients, while the original performance is preserved in the sense that the transfer function of the closed-loop system remains unchanged.

Title: Optimum and Adaptive Complex-Valued Bilinear Filters
Authors: Bernhard Plaimer, Matthias Wagner, Oliver Lang, Mario Huemer
Abstract: The identification of nonlinear systems is a frequent task in digital signal processing. Such nonlinear systems may be grouped into many sub-classes, whereby numerous nonlinear real-world systems can be approximated as bilinear (BL) models. Therefore, various optimum and adaptive BL filters have been introduced in recent years. Moreover, in many applications, such as communications and radar, complex-valued (CV) BL systems in combination with CV signals may occur. Hence, in this work, we investigate the extension of real-valued (RV) BL filters to CV BL filters. First, we derive CV BL filters by applying two or four RV BL filters, and compare them with respect to their computational complexity and performance. Second, we introduce novel fully CV BL filters, such as the CV BL Wiener filter (C-BWF), the CV BL least squares (C-BLS) filter, the CV BL least mean squares (C-BLMS) filter, the CV BL normalized least mean squares (C-BNLMS) filter, and the CV BL recursive least squares (C-BRLS) filter. Finally, these filters are applied to identify CV multiple-input-single-output (MISO) systems and CV Hammerstein models.

Title: Algorithm Unrolling-based Denoising of Multimodal Graph Signals
Authors: Hayate Kojima, Keigo Takanami, Junya Hara, Yukihiro Bandoh, Seishi Takamura, Hiroshi Higashi, Yuichi Tanaka
Abstract: We propose a denoising method for multimodal graph signals by an alternating minimization scheme that sequentially solves signal restoration and graph learning problems. Many complex-structured data, i.e., those on sensor networks, can capture multiple modalities at each measurement point, referred to as modalities. They are also assumed to have an underlying structure or correlations in modality as well as space. Such multimodal data are regarded as graph signals on a twofold graph and they are often corrupted by noise. Furthermore, their spatial/modality relationships are not always given a priori: We need to estimate twofold graphs during a denoising algorithm. In this paper, we consider a signal denoising method on twofold graphs, where graphs are learned simultaneously. Specifically, the graph learning subproblems are solved using the primal-dual splitting (PDS) algorithm, while the signal update has a closed-form solution. Parameters in this iterative algorithm are learned from training data by unrolling the iteration with deep algorithm unrolling. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing model- and deep learning-based graph signal denoising methods.

Title: Two-Stage Bidirectional Inverter Equivalent Circuit Model for Distribution Grid Steady-State Analysis and Optimization
Authors: Emmanuel O. Badmus, Amritanshu Pandey
Abstract: This paper presents a \textit{physics-based} steady-state equivalent circuit model of a two-stage bidirectional inverter. These inverters connect distributed energy resources (DERs), such as photovoltaic (PV) and battery systems, to distribution grids. Existing inverter models have technical gaps on three fronts: i) inadequate modeling of inverter losses; ii) use of mathematical abstractions for bidirectional flow of power; and iii) inability to integrate different control modes into nonlinear solvers without loss of generality. We propose a physics-first model that explicitly captures losses in passive circuit components based on circuit-level principles. We enable bidirectional power flow without binary or complementarity constraints by formulating loss terms as smooth, sign-aware expressions of current. We introduce and parameterize controlled current sources with twice-differentiable continuous functions to enable inverter control modes without loss of generality. We integrate DERs with the proposed inverter model at the load buses of distribution networks to perform power flow and optimization studies on real-world distribution networks with over 20,000 nodes. We demonstrate that the proposed model is more accurate, integrates seamlessly with various control modes without loss of generality, and scales robustly to large optimization problems. Index Terms: bidirectional inverter model, circuit-based modeling, DERs, inverter efficiency, power control, steady-state analysis.

Authors: Haotian Zhang, Shijian Gao, Weibo Wen, Xiang Cheng, Liuqing Yang
Abstract: This paper investigates a heterogeneous multi-vehicle, multi-modal sensing (H-MVMM) aided online precoding problem. The proposed H-MVMM scheme utilizes a vertical federated learning (VFL) framework to minimize pilot sequence length and optimize the sum rate. This offers a promising solution for reducing latency in frequency division duplexing systems. To achieve this, three preprocessing modules are designed to transform raw sensory data into informative representations relevant to precoding. The approach effectively addresses local data heterogeneity arising from diverse on-board sensor configurations through a well-structured VFL training procedure. Additionally, a label-free online model updating strategy is introduced, enabling the H-MVMM scheme to adapt its weights flexibly. This strategy features a pseudo downlink channel state information label simulator (PCSI-Simulator), which is trained using a semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach alongside an online loss function. Numerical results show that the proposed method can closely approximate the performance of traditional optimization techniques with perfect channel state information, achieving a significant 90.6\% reduction in pilot sequence length.

Title: Dynamic Hybrid Modeling: Incremental Identification and Model Predictive Control
Authors: Adrian Caspari, Thomas Bierweiler, Sarah Fadda, Daniel Labisch, Maarten Nauta, Franzisko Wagner, Merle Warmbold, Constantinos C. Pantelides
Abstract: Mathematical models are crucial for optimizing and controlling chemical processes, yet they often face significant limitations in terms of computational time, algorithm complexity, and development costs. Hybrid models, which combine mechanistic models with data-driven models (i.e. models derived via the application of machine learning to experimental data), have emerged as a promising solution to these challenges. However, the identification of dynamic hybrid models remains difficult due to the need to integrate data-driven models within mechanistic model structures. We present an incremental identification approach for dynamic hybrid models that decouples the mechanistic and data-driven components to overcome computational and conceptual difficulties. Our methodology comprises four key steps: (1) regularized dynamic parameter estimation to determine optimal time profiles for flux variables, (2) correlation analysis to evaluate relationships between variables, (3) data-driven model identification using advanced machine learning techniques, and (4) hybrid model integration to combine the mechanistic and data-driven components. This approach facilitates early evaluation of model structure suitability, accelerates the development of hybrid models, and allows for independent identification of data-driven components. Three case studies are presented to illustrate the robustness, reliability, and efficiency of our incremental approach in handling complex systems and scenarios with limited data.

Title: Event2Audio: Event-Based Optical Vibration Sensing
Authors: Mingxuan Cai, Dekel Galor, Amit Pal Singh Kohli, Jacob L. Yates, Laura Waller
Abstract: Small vibrations observed in video can unveil information beyond what is visual, such as sound and material properties. It is possible to passively record these vibrations when they are visually perceptible, or actively amplify their visual contribution with a laser beam when they are not perceptible. In this paper, we improve upon the active sensing approach by leveraging event-based cameras, which are designed to efficiently capture fast motion. We demonstrate our method experimentally by recovering audio from vibrations, even for multiple simultaneous sources, and in the presence of environmental distortions. Our approach matches the state-of-the-art reconstruction quality at much faster speeds, approaching real-time processing.

Title: I2I-PR: Deep Iterative Refinement for Phase Retrieval using Image-to-Image Diffusion Models
Authors: Mehmet Onurcan Kaya, Figen S. Oktem
Abstract: Phase retrieval aims to recover a signal from intensity-only measurements, a fundamental problem in many fields such as imaging, holography, optical computing, crystallography, and microscopy. Although there are several well-known phase retrieval algorithms, including classical alternating projection-based solvers, the reconstruction performance often remains sensitive to initialization and measurement noise. Recently, diffusion models have gained traction in various image reconstruction tasks, yielding significant theoretical insights and practical advances. In this work, we introduce a deep iterative refinement framework that redefines the role of diffusion models in phase retrieval. Instead of generating images from random noise, our method starts with multiple physically consistent initial estimates and iteratively refines them through a learned image-to-image diffusion process. This enables data-driven phase retrieval that is both interpretable and robust, leveraging the strengths of classical solvers while mitigating their weaknesses. Furthermore, we propose an enhanced initialization strategy that integrates classical algorithms with a novel acceleration mechanism to obtain reliable initial estimates. During inference, we adopt a geometric self-ensemble strategy based on input flipping, together with output aggregation to further improve the final reconstruction quality. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves substantial gains in both training efficiency and reconstruction quality, consistently outperforming classical and recent state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the potential of diffusion-driven refinement as an effective and general framework for robust phase retrieval across diverse applications.

Title: Aligning Generative Speech Enhancement with Perceptual Feedback
Authors: Haoyang Li, Nana Hou, Yuchen Hu, Jixun Yao, Sabato Marco Siniscalchi, Xuyi Zhuang, Deheng Ye, Wei Yang, Eng Siong Chng
Abstract: Language Model (LM)-based speech enhancement (SE) has recently emerged as a promising direction, but existing approaches predominantly rely on token-level likelihood objectives that weakly reflect human perception. This mismatch limits progress, as optimizing signal accuracy does not always improve naturalness or listening comfort. We address this gap by introducing a perceptually aligned LM-based SE approach. Our method applies Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with UTMOS, a neural MOS predictor, as a proxy for human ratings, directly steering models toward perceptually preferred outputs. This design directly connects model training to perceptual quality and is broadly applicable within LM-based SE frameworks. On the Deep Noise Suppression Challenge 2020 test sets, our approach consistently improves speech quality metrics, achieving relative gains of up to 56%. To our knowledge, this is the first integration of perceptual feedback into LM-based SE and the first application of DPO in the SE domain, establishing a new paradigm for perceptually aligned enhancement with SE.

Title: Spatiotemporal Maps for Dynamic MRI Reconstruction
Authors: Rodrigo A. Lobos, Xiaokai Wang, Rex T. L. Fung, Yongli He, David Frey, Dinank Gupta, Zhongming Liu, Jeffrey A. Fessler, Douglas C. Noll
Abstract: The partially separable functions (PSF) model is commonly adopted in dynamic MRI reconstruction, as is the underlying signal model in many reconstruction methods including the ones relying on low-rank assumptions. Even though the PSF model offers a parsimonious representation of the dynamic MRI signal in several applications, its representation capabilities tend to decrease in scenarios where voxels present different temporal/spectral characteristics at different spatial locations. In this work we account for this limitation by proposing a new model, called spatiotemporal maps (STMs), that leverages autoregressive properties of (k, t)-space. The STM model decomposes the spatiotemporal MRI signal into a sum of components, each one consisting of a product between a spatial function and a temporal function that depends on the spatial location. The proposed model can be interpreted as an extension of the PSF model whose temporal functions are independent of the spatial location. We show that spatiotemporal maps can be efficiently computed from autocalibration data by using advanced signal processing and randomized linear algebra techniques, enabling STMs to be used as part of many reconstruction frameworks for accelerated dynamic MRI. As proof-of-concept illustrations, we show that STMs can be used to reconstruct both 2D single-channel animal gastrointestinal MRI data and 3D multichannel human functional MRI data.

Title: Metasurface-Enabled Extremely Large-Scale Antenna Systems: Transceiver Architecture, Physical Modeling, and Channel Estimation
Authors: Zhengyu Wang, Tiebin Mi, Gui Zhou, Robert C. Qiu
Abstract: Extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) have emerged as a pivotal technology for addressing the unprecedented performance demands of next-generation wireless communication systems. To enhance their practicality, we propose metasurface-enabled extremely large-scale antenna (MELA) systems -- novel transceiver architectures that employ reconfigurable transmissive metasurfaces to facilitate efficient over-the-air RF-to-antenna coupling and phase control. This architecture eliminates the need for bulky switch matrices and costly phase-shifter networks typically required in conventional solutions. Physically grounded models are developed to characterize electromagnetic field propagation through individual transmissive unit cells, capturing the fundamental physics of wave transformation and transmission. Additionally, distance-dependent approximate models are introduced, exhibiting structural properties conducive to efficient parameter estimation and signal processing. Based on the channel model, a two stage channel estimation framework is proposed for the scenarios comprising users in the hybrid near- and far-fields. In the first stage, a dictionary-driven beamspace filtering technique enables rapid angular-domain scanning. In the refinement stage, the rotational symmetry of subarrays is exploited to design super-resolution estimators that jointly recover angular and range parameters. An analytical expression for the half-power beamwidth of MELA is derived, revealing its near-optimal spatial resolution relative to conventional ELAA architectures. Numerical experiments further validate the high-resolution of the proposed channel estimation algorithm and the fidelity of the electromagnetic model, positioning the MELA architecture as a highly competitive and forward-looking solution for practical ELAA deployment.

Title: An Analytical and Experimental Study of Distributed Uplink Beamforming in the Presence of Carrier Frequency Offsets
Authors: Mehdi Zafari, Divyanshu Pandey, Rahman Doost-Mohammady
Abstract: Realizing distributed multi-user beamforming (D-MUBF) in time division duplex (TDD)-based multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) systems faces significant challenges. One of the most fundamental challenges is achieving accurate over-the-air (OTA) timing and frequency synchronization among distributed access points (APs), particularly due to residual frequency offsets caused by local oscillator (LO) drifts. Despite decades of research on synchronization for MU-MIMO, there are only a few experimental studies that evaluate D-MUBF techniques under imperfect frequency synchronization among distributed antennas. This paper presents an analytical and experimental assessment of D-MUBF methods in the presence of frequency synchronization errors. We provide closed-form expressions for signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) as a function of channel characteristics and statistical properties of carrier frequency offset (CFO) among AP antennas. In addition, through experimental evaluations conducted with the RENEW massive MIMO testbed, we collected comprehensive datasets across various experimental scenarios. These datasets comprise uplink pilot samples for channel and CFO estimation, in addition to uplink multi-user data intended for analyzing D-MUBF techniques. By examining these datasets, we assess the performance of D-MUBF in the presence of CFO and compare the analytical predictions with empirical measurements. Furthermore, we make the datasets publicly available and provide insights on utilizing them for future research endeavors.

Title: Improving the Speaker Anonymization Evaluation's Robustness to Target Speakers with Adversarial Learning
Authors: Carlos Franzreb, Arnab Das, Tim Polzehl, Sebastian Möller
Abstract: The current privacy evaluation for speaker anonymization often overestimates privacy when a same-gender target selection algorithm (TSA) is used, although this TSA leaks the speaker's gender and should hence be more vulnerable. We hypothesize that this occurs because the evaluation does not account for the fact that anonymized speech contains information from both the source and target speakers. To address this, we propose to add a target classifier that measures the influence of target speaker information in the evaluation, which can also be removed with adversarial learning. Experiments demonstrate that this approach is effective for multiple anonymizers, particularly when using a same-gender TSA, leading to a more reliable assessment.

Title: Real-Time Reconstruction of 3D Bone Models via Very-Low-Dose Protocols

Abstract: Patient-specific bone models are essential for designing surgical guides and preoperative planning, as they enable the visualization of intricate anatomical structures. However, traditional CT-based approaches for creating bone models are limited to preoperative use due to the low flexibility and high radiation exposure of CT and time-consuming manual delineation. Here, we introduce Semi-Supervised Reconstruction with Knowledge Distillation (SSR-KD), a fast and accurate AI framework to reconstruct high-quality bone models from biplanar X-rays in 30 seconds, with an average error under 1.0 mm, eliminating the dependence on CT and manual work. Additionally, high tibial osteotomy simulation was performed by experts on reconstructed bone models, demonstrating that bone models reconstructed from biplanar X-rays have comparable clinical applicability to those annotated from CT. Overall, our approach accelerates the process, reduces radiation exposure, enables intraoperative guidance, and significantly improves the practicality of bone models, offering transformative applications in orthopedics.

Title: A predictive modular approach to constraint satisfaction under uncertainty -- with application to glycosylation in continuous monoclonal antibody biosimilar production
Authors: Yu Wang, Xiao Chen, Hubert Schwarz, Véronique Chotteau, Elling W. Jacobsen
Abstract: The paper proposes a modular-based approach to constraint handling in process optimization and control. This is partly motivated by the recent interest in learning-based methods, e.g., within bioproduction, for which constraint handling under uncertainty is a challenge. The proposed constraint handler, called predictive filter, is combined with an adaptive constraint margin and a constraint violation cost monitor to minimize the cost of violating soft constraints due to model uncertainty and disturbances. The module can be combined with any controller and is based on minimally modifying the controller output, in a least squares sense, such that constraints are satisfied within the considered horizon. The proposed method is computationally efficient and suitable for real-time applications. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated through a realistic case study of glycosylation constraint satisfaction in continuous monoclonal antibody biosimilar production using Chinese hamster ovary cells, employing a metabolic network model consisting of 23 extracellular metabolites and 126 reactions. In the case study, the average constraint-violation cost is reduced by more than 60% compared to the case without the proposed constraint-handling method.

Title: Safe Navigation under State Uncertainty: Online Adaptation for Robust Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Ersin Das, Rahal Nanayakkara, Xiao Tan, Ryan M. Bena, Joel W. Burdick, Paulo Tabuada, Aaron D. Ames
Abstract: Measurements and state estimates are often imperfect in control practice, posing challenges for safety-critical applications, where safety guarantees rely on accurate state information. In the presence of estimation errors, several prior robust control barrier function (R-CBF) formulations have imposed strict conditions on the input. These methods can be overly conservative and can introduce issues such as infeasibility, high control effort, etc. This work proposes a systematic method to improve R-CBFs, and demonstrates its advantages on a tracked vehicle that navigates among multiple obstacles. A primary contribution is a new optimization-based online parameter adaptation scheme that reduces the conservativeness of existing R-CBFs. In order to reduce the complexity of the parameter optimization, we merge several safety constraints into one unified numerical CBF via Poisson's equation. We further address the dual relative degree issue that typically causes difficulty in vehicle tracking. Experimental trials demonstrate the overall performance improvement of our approach over existing formulations.

Title: Sequential Spectral Clustering of Data Sequences
Authors: G Dhinesh Chandran, Kota Srinivas Reddy, Srikrishna Bhashyam
Abstract: We study the problem of non-parametric clustering of data sequences, where each data sequence comprises independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples generated from an unknown distribution. The true clusters are the clusters obtained using the Spectral clustering algorithm (SPEC) on the pairwise distance between the true distributions corresponding to the data sequences. Since the true distributions are unknown, the objective is to estimate the clusters by observing the minimum number of samples from the data sequences, given a specified error probability. To solve this problem, we propose the Sequential Spectral clustering algorithm (SEQ-SPEC), and show that it stops in finite time almost surely and is exponentially consistent. We also propose a computationally more efficient algorithm called the Incremental Approximate Sequential Spectral clustering algorithm (IA-SEQ-SPEC). Through simulations, we show that both SEQ-SPEC and IA-SEQ-SPEC perform better than the fixed sample size SPEC, the Sequential $K$-Medoids clustering algorithm (SEQ-KMED), and the Sequential Single Linkage clustering algorithm (SEQ-SLINK). In addition, we propose memory-efficient versions, SEQ-SPEC-B and IA-SEQ-SPEC-B. Unlike other related sequential clustering algorithms, which require storing all past samples, these algorithms require storing only the most recent $B$ samples. Both the computationally efficient and memory-efficient versions of SEQ-SPEC perform comparably to SEQ-SPEC in simulations.

Title: DAIEN-TTS: Disentangled Audio Infilling for Environment-Aware Text-to-Speech Synthesis
Authors: Ye-Xin Lu, Yu Gu, Kun Wei, Hui-Peng Du, Yang Ai, Zhen-Hua Ling
Abstract: This paper presents DAIEN-TTS, a zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) framework that enables ENvironment-aware synthesis through Disentangled Audio Infilling. By leveraging separate speaker and environment prompts, DAIEN-TTS allows independent control over the timbre and the background environment of the synthesized speech. Built upon F5-TTS, the proposed DAIEN-TTS first incorporates a pretrained speech-environment separation (SES) module to disentangle the environmental speech into mel-spectrograms of clean speech and environment audio. Two random span masks of varying lengths are then applied to both mel-spectrograms, which, together with the text embedding, serve as conditions for infilling the masked environmental mel-spectrogram, enabling the simultaneous continuation of personalized speech and time-varying environmental audio. To further enhance controllability during inference, we adopt dual classifier-free guidance (DCFG) for the speech and environment components and introduce a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) adaptation strategy to align the synthesized speech with the environment prompt. Experimental results demonstrate that DAIEN-TTS generates environmental personalized speech with high naturalness, strong speaker similarity, and high environmental fidelity.

Title: QASTAnet: A DNN-based Quality Metric for Spatial Audio
Authors: Adrien Llave, Emma Granier, Grégory Pallone
Abstract: In the development of spatial audio technologies, reliable and shared methods for evaluating audio quality are essential. Listening tests are currently the standard but remain costly in terms of time and resources. Several models predicting subjective scores have been proposed, but they do not generalize well to real-world signals. In this paper, we propose QASTAnet (Quality Assessment for SpaTial Audio network), a new metric based on a deep neural network, specialized on spatial audio (ambisonics and binaural). As training data is scarce, we aim for the model to be trainable with a small amount of data. To do so, we propose to rely on expert modeling of the low-level auditory system and use a neurnal network to model the high-level cognitive function of the quality judgement. We compare its performance to two reference metrics on a wide range of content types (speech, music, ambiance, anechoic, reverberated) and focusing on codec artifacts. Results demonstrate that QASTAnet overcomes the aforementioned limitations of the existing methods. The strong correlation between the proposed metric prediction and subjective scores makes it a good candidate for comparing codecs in their development.

Title: SoundCompass: Navigating Target Sound Extraction With Effective Directional Clue Integration In Complex Acoustic Scenes
Authors: Dayun Choi, Jung-Woo Choi
Abstract: Recent advances in target sound extraction (TSE) utilize directional clues derived from direction of arrival (DoA), which represent an inherent spatial property of sound available in any acoustic scene. However, previous DoA-based methods rely on hand-crafted features or discrete encodings, which lose fine-grained spatial information and limit adaptability. We propose SoundCompass, an effective directional clue integration framework centered on a Spectral Pairwise INteraction (SPIN) module that captures cross-channel spatial correlations in the complex spectrogram domain to preserve full spatial information in multichannel signals. The input feature expressed in terms of spatial correlations is fused with a DoA clue represented as spherical harmonics (SH) encoding. The fusion is carried out across overlapping frequency subbands, inheriting the benefits reported in the previous band-split architectures. We also incorporate the iterative refinement strategy, chain-of-inference (CoI), in the TSE framework, which recursively fuses DoA with sound event activation estimated from the previous inference stage. Experiments demonstrate that SoundCompass, combining SPIN, SH embedding, and CoI, robustly extracts target sources across diverse signal classes and spatial configurations.

Title: Objective Evaluation of Prosody and Intelligibility in Speech Synthesis via Conditional Prediction of Discrete Tokens
Authors: Ismail Rasim Ulgen, Zongyang Du, Junchen Lu, Philipp Koehn, Berrak Sisman
Abstract: Objective evaluation of synthesized speech is critical for advancing speech generation systems, yet existing metrics for intelligibility and prosody remain limited in scope and weakly correlated with human perception. Word Error Rate (WER) provides only a coarse text-based measure of intelligibility, while F0-RMSE and related pitch-based metrics offer a narrow, reference-dependent view of prosody. To address these limitations, we propose TTScore, a targeted and reference-free evaluation framework based on conditional prediction of discrete speech tokens. TTScore employs two sequence-to-sequence predictors conditioned on input text: TTScore-int, which measures intelligibility through content tokens, and TTScore-pro, which evaluates prosody through prosody tokens. For each synthesized utterance, the predictors compute the likelihood of the corresponding token sequences, yielding interpretable scores that capture alignment with intended linguistic content and prosodic structure. Experiments on the SOMOS, VoiceMOS, and TTSArena benchmarks demonstrate that TTScore-int and TTScore-pro provide reliable, aspect-specific evaluation and achieve stronger correlations with human judgments of overall quality than existing intelligibility and prosody-focused metrics.

Title: Approximation of the Range Ambiguity Function in Near-field Sensing Systems
Authors: Marcin Wachowiak, André Bourdoux, Sofie Pollin
Abstract: This paper investigates the range ambiguity function of near-field systems where bandwidth and near-field beamfocusing jointly determine the resolution. First, the general matched filter ambiguity function is derived and the near-field array factors of different antenna array geometries are introduced. Next, the near-field ambiguity function is approximated as a product of the range-dependent near-field array factor and the ambiguity function due to the utilized waveform and bandwidth. An approximation criterion based on the aperture-bandwidth product is formulated, and its accuracy is examined. Finally, the improvements to the ambiguity function offered by the near-field beamfocusing, as compared to the far-field case, are presented. The performance gains are evaluated in terms of resolution improvement offered by beamfocusing, peak-to-sidelobe and integrated-sidelobe level improvement for a few popular array geometries. The gains offered by the near-field regime are shown to be range-dependent and substantial only in close proximity to the array.

Title: Neural Fields for Highly Accelerated 2D Cine Phase Contrast MRI
Authors: Pablo Arratia, Martin J. Graves, Mary McLean, Carolin Pirkl, Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb, Timo Schirmer, Florian Wiesinger, Matthias J. Ehrhardt
Abstract: 2D cine phase contrast (CPC) MRI provides quantitative information on blood velocity and flow within the human vasculature. However, data acquisition is time-consuming, motivating the reconstruction of the velocity field from undersampled measurements to reduce scan times. In this work, neural fields are proposed as a continuous spatiotemporal parametrization of complex-valued images, jointly modeling magnitude and phase across multiple echoes to enable velocity estimation, and leveraging their inductive bias for the reconstruction of the velocity data. Additionally, to compensate for the oversmoothing tendency observed in neural-field reconstructions under severe undersampling, a simple voxel-based postprocessing step is introduced. The method is validated numerically in Cartesian and radial k-space with both high and low temporal resolution data. This approach achieves accurate reconstructions at high acceleration factors, with low errors even at 32$\times$ and 64$\times$ undersampling for the high temporal resolution data, and 16$\times$ for the low temporal resolution data, and consistently outperforms classical locally low-rank regularized voxel-based methods in both flow estimates and anatomical depiction.

Title: Accurate Small-Signal Modeling of Digitally Controlled Buck Converters with ADC-PWM Synchronization
Authors: Hang Zhou, Yuxin Yang, Branislav Hredzak, John Edward Fletcher
Abstract: Digital control has become increasingly widespread in modern power electronic converters. When acquiring feedback signals such as the inductor current, synchronizing the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with the digital pulse-width modulator (DPWM) is commonly employed to accurately track their steady-state average. However, the small-signal implications of such synchronization have not been investigated. This paper presents an exact small-signal model for digitally controlled buck converters operating in forced continuous-conduction mode (FCCM) under constant-frequency current-mode control, explicitly accounting for DPWM-ADC synchronization. Using a sampled-data framework, the proposed model captures all sideband effects introduced by the sampling process, yielding precise predictions of both analog and digital loop gains, even at frequencies beyond the switching and sampling frequencies. Both asymmetrical and symmetrical carrier modulations are considered. Furthermore, the digital loop gain is derived in closed form using the modified z-transform, enabling low-complexity compensator design and stability assessment. Within this framework, the analog loop gain can be directly obtained from the digital loop gain, thereby eliminating the need for computationally intensive infinite series evaluations. The validity of the proposed model is confirmed through both simulation and experimental results.

Title: AnyRIR: Robust Non-intrusive Room Impulse Response Estimation in the Wild
Authors: Kyung Yun Lee, Nils Meyer-Kahlen, Karolina Prawda, Vesa Välimäki, Sebastian J. Schlecht
Abstract: We address the problem of estimating room impulse responses (RIRs) in noisy, uncontrolled environments where non-stationary sounds such as speech or footsteps corrupt conventional deconvolution. We propose AnyRIR, a non-intrusive method that uses music as the excitation signal instead of a dedicated test signal, and formulate RIR estimation as an L1-norm regression in the time-frequency domain. Solved efficiently with Iterative Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) and Least-Squares Minimal Residual (LSMR) methods, this approach exploits the sparsity of non-stationary noise to suppress its influence. Experiments on simulated and measured data show that AnyRIR outperforms L2-based and frequency-domain deconvolution, under in-the-wild noisy scenarios and codec mismatch, enabling robust RIR estimation for AR/VR and related applications.

Title: TVMC: Time-Varying Mesh Compression via Multi-Stage Anchor Mesh Generation
Authors: He Huang, Qi Yang, Yiling Xu, Zhu Li, Jenq-Neng Hwang
Abstract: Time-varying meshes, characterized by dynamic connectivity and varying vertex counts, hold significant promise for applications such as augmented reality. However, their practical utilization remains challenging due to the substantial data volume required for high-fidelity representation. While various compression methods attempt to leverage temporal redundancy between consecutive mesh frames, most struggle with topological inconsistency and motion-induced artifacts. To address these issues, we propose Time-Varying Mesh Compression (TVMC), a novel framework built on multi-stage coarse-to-fine anchor mesh generation for inter-frame prediction. Specifically, the anchor mesh is progressively constructed in three stages: initial, coarse, and fine. The initial anchor mesh is obtained through fast topology alignment to exploit temporal coherence. A Kalman filter-based motion estimation module then generates a coarse anchor mesh by accurately compensating inter-frame motions. Subsequently, a Quadric Error Metric-based refinement step optimizes vertex positions to form a fine anchor mesh with improved geometric fidelity. Based on the refined anchor mesh, the inter-frame motions relative to the reference base mesh are encoded, while the residual displacements between the subdivided fine anchor mesh and the input mesh are adaptively quantized and compressed. This hierarchical strategy preserves consistent connectivity and high-quality surface approximation, while achieving an efficient and compact representation of dynamic geometry. Extensive experiments on standard MPEG dynamic mesh sequences demonstrate that TVMC achieves state-of-the-art compression performance. Compared to the latest V-DMC standard, it delivers a significant BD-rate gain of 10.2% ~ 16.9%, while preserving high reconstruction quality. The code is available at this https URL.

Title: Blockage-Aware Multi-RIS WSR Maximization via Per-RIS Indexed Synchronization Sequences and Closed-Form Riemannian Updates
Authors: Sehyun Ryu, Hyun Jong Yang
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) multi-user MIMO systems are highly vulnerable to blockage, and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have been proposed as a remedy. However, RIS links may themselves be blocked, while most prior works assume ideal RIS availability. We propose an end-to-end blockage-aware multi-RIS weighted sum-rate (WSR) optimization framework. The BS transmits short per-RIS indexed synchronization signals, enabling each user to identify blocked panels through a simple energy detection test. Based on the detected feasible sets, we jointly optimize the BS precoder and RIS phases via a Closed-form Riemannian Phase Alignment (CRPA) algorithm. CRPA provides unit-modulus-preserving closed-form updates, requiring no projection or line search, and ensures monotone ascent. Simulations validate reliable blockage detection and notable WSR and convergence gains over existing baselines.

Title: Direction-of-Arrival and Noise Covariance Matrix joint estimation for beamforming
Authors: Vitor Gelsleichter Probst Curtarelli, Stephan Paul, Anderson Wedderhoff Spengler
Abstract: We propose a joint estimation method for the Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) and the Noise Covariance Matrix (NCM) tailored for beamforming applications. Building upon an existing NCM framework, our approach simplifies the estimation procedure by deriving an quasi-linear solution, instead of the traditional exhaustive search. Additionally, we introduce a novel DoA estimation technique that operates across all frequency bins, improving robustness in reverberant environments. Simulation results demonstrate that our method outperforms classical techniques, such as MUSIC, in mid- to high-angle scenarios, achieving lower angular errors and superior signal enhancement through beamforming. The proposed framework was also fared against other techniques for signal enhancement, having better noise rejection and interference canceling capabilities. These improvements are validated using both theoretical and empirical performance metrics.

Title: Retail electricity costs and emissions incentives are misaligned for commercial and industrial power consumers
Authors: Fletcher T. Chapin, Akshay K. Rao, Adhithyan Sakthivelu, Carson I. Tucker, Eres David, Casey S. Chen, Erin Musabandesu, Meagan S. Mauter
Abstract: Electrification is contributing to substantial growth in U.S. commercial and industrial loads, but the cost and Scope 2 carbon emission implications of this load growth are opaque for both power consumers and utilities. This work describes a unique spatiotemporally resolved data set of U.S. electricity costs and emissions and applies time series approximation methods to quantify the alignment of electricity cost and emission incentives for large commercial and industrial consumers. We present a comprehensive spatiotemporal dataset of U.S. price-based demand response (i.e., tariff) and incentive-based demand response programs, enabling direct comparison to previously published marginal emission factor, average emission factor, and day-ahead market prices. We resolved the structural incompatibility and fragmentation of these datasets by developing time series approximations of discrete data and unifying geospatially heterogeneous datasets. Analysis of these datasets reveals significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity in cost and carbon emissions incentives for demand-side energy flexibility, underscoring the importance of site selection as a key factor influencing power costs and Scope 2 emissions. Analysis also reveals broad misalignment of economic and emissions incentives under existing electricity tariff structures, meaning tariffs are incentivizing consumption of more carbon-intensive electricity, and highlighting potential barriers to electrification delivering carbon savings.

Title: Knowledge Distillation for Continual Learning of Biomedical Neural Fields
Authors: Wouter Visser, Jelmer M. Wolterink
Abstract: Neural fields are increasingly used as a light-weight, continuous, and differentiable signal representation in (bio)medical imaging. However, unlike discrete signal representations such as voxel grids, neural fields cannot be easily extended. As neural fields are, in essence, neural networks, prior signals represented in a neural field will degrade when the model is presented with new data due to catastrophic forgetting. This work examines the extent to which different neural field approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting and proposes a strategy to mitigate this issue. We consider the scenario in which data becomes available incrementally, with only the most recent data available for neural field fitting. In a series of experiments on cardiac cine MRI data, we demonstrate how knowledge distillation mitigates catastrophic forgetting when the spatiotemporal domain is enlarged or the dimensionality of the represented signal is increased. We find that the amount of catastrophic forgetting depends, to a large extent, on the neural fields model used, and that distillation could enable continual learning in neural fields.

Title: A Spatial Array for Spectrally Agile Wireless Processing
Authors: Ali Rasteh, Andrew Hennessee, Ishaan Shivhare, Siddharth Garg, Sundeep Rangan, Brandon Reagen
Abstract: Massive MIMO is a cornerstone of next-generation wireless communication, offering significant gains in capacity, reliability, and energy efficiency. However, to meet emerging demands such as high-frequency operation, wide bandwidths, co-existence, integrated sensing, and resilience to dynamic interference, future systems must exhibit both scalability and spectral agility. These requirements place increasing pressure on the underlying processing hardware to be both efficient and reconfigurable. This paper proposes a custom-designed spatial array architecture that serves as a reconfigurable, general-purpose core optimized for a class of wireless kernels that commonly arise in diverse communications and sensing tasks. The proposed spatial array is evaluated against specialized cores for each kernel using High-Level Synthesis (HLS). Both the reconfigurable and specialized designs are synthesized in a 32 nm process to assess latency, throughput, area, and power in realistic processes. The results identify conditions under which general-purpose systolic architectures can approach the efficiency of specialized cores, thereby paving the way toward more scalable and agile systems.

Authors: Hannes Homburger, Katrin Baumgärtner, Moritz Diehl, Johannes Reuter
Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control is a sampling-based optimization method that has recently attracted attention, particularly in the robotics and reinforcement learning communities. MPPI has been widely applied as a GPU-accelerated random search method to deterministic direct single-shooting optimal control problems arising in model predictive control (MPC) formulations. MPPI offers several key advantages, including flexibility, robustness, ease of implementation, and inherent parallelizability. However, its performance can deteriorate in high-dimensional settings since the optimal control problem is solved via Monte Carlo sampling. To address this limitation, this paper proposes an enhanced MPPI method that incorporates a Jacobian reconstruction technique and the second-order Generalized Gauss-Newton method. This novel approach is called \textit{Gauss-Newton accelerated MPPI}. The numerical results show that the Gauss-Newton accelerated MPPI approach substantially improves MPPI scalability and computational efficiency while preserving the key benefits of the classical MPPI framework, making it a promising approach even for high-dimensional problems.

Title: Formation and Investigation of Cooperative Platooning at the Early Stage of Connected and Automated Vehicles Deployment
Authors: Zeyu Mu, Sergei S. Avedisov, Ahmadreza Moradipari, B. Brian Park
Abstract: Cooperative platooning, enabled by cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC), is a cornerstone technology for connected automated vehicles (CAVs), offering significant improvements in safety, comfort, and traffic efficiency over traditional adaptive cruise control (ACC). This paper addresses a key challenge in the initial deployment phase of CAVs: the limited benefits of cooperative platooning due to the sparse distribution of CAVs on the road. To overcome this limitation, we propose an innovative control framework that enhances cooperative platooning in mixed traffic environments. Two techniques are utilized: (1) a mixed cooperative platooning strategy that integrates CACC with unconnected vehicles (CACCu), and (2) a strategic lane-change decision model designed to facilitate safe and efficient lane changes for platoon formation. Additionally, a surrounding vehicle identification system is embedded in the framework to enable CAVs to effectively identify and select potential platooning leaders. Simulation studies across various CV market penetration rates (MPRs) show that incorporating CACCu systems significantly improves safety, comfort, and traffic efficiency compared to existing systems with only CACC and ACC systems, even at CV penetration as low as 10%. The maximized platoon formation increases by up to 24%, accompanied by an 11% reduction in acceleration and a 7% decrease in fuel consumption. Furthermore, the strategic lane-change model enhances CAV performance, achieving notable improvements between 6% and 60% CV penetration, without adversely affecting overall traffic flow.

Title: Validation methodology on real data of reversible Kalman Filter for state estimation with Manifold
Authors: Svyatoslav Covanov, Cedric Pradalier
Abstract: This work extends a previous study that introduced an algorithm for state estimation on manifolds within the framework of the Kalman filter. Its objective is to address the limitations of the earlier approach. The reversible Kalman filter was designed to provide a methodology for evaluating the accuracy of existing Kalman filter variants with arbitrary precision on synthetic data. It has favorable numerical properties on synthetic data, achieving arbitrary precision without relying on the small-velocity assumption and depending only on sensor noise. However, its application to real data encountered difficulties related to measurement noise, which was mitigated using a heuristic. In particular, the heuristic involved an event detection step switching between reversible Kalman filter and classical Kalman variant at chosen moments. In the present work, we propose a study of this detection step and propose a methodology to prove at which moment the reversible Kalman approach improves on classical multiplicative variant.

Title: Robust Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding for Video Transmission over Multipath Fading Channel
Authors: Bohuai Xiao, Jian Zou, Fanyang Meng, Wei Liu, Yongsheng Liang
Abstract: To address the challenges of wireless video transmission over multipath fading channels, we propose a robust deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) framework by effectively exploiting temporal redundancy and incorporating robust innovations at the modulation, coding, and decoding stages. At the modulation stage, tailored orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for robust video transmission is employed, decomposing wideband signals into orthogonal frequency-flat sub-channels to effectively mitigate frequency-selective fading. At the coding stage, conditional contextual coding with multi-scale Gaussian warped features is introduced to efficiently model temporal redundancy, significantly improving reconstruction quality under strict bandwidth constraints. At the decoding stage, a lightweight denoising module is integrated to robustly simplify signal restoration and accelerate convergence, addressing the suboptimality and slow convergence typically associated with simultaneously performing channel estimation, equalization, and semantic reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed robust framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art video DeepJSCC methods, achieving an average reconstruction quality gain of 5.13 dB under challenging multipath fading channel conditions.

Title: Conditioning Aircraft Trajectory Prediction on Meteorological Data with a Physics-Informed Machine Learning Approach
Authors: Amy Hodgkin, Nick Pepper, Marc Thomas
Abstract: Accurate aircraft trajectory prediction (TP) in air traffic management systems is confounded by a number of epistemic uncertainties, dominated by uncertain meteorological conditions and operator specific procedures. Handling this uncertainty necessitates the use of probabilistic, machine learned models for generating trajectories. However, the trustworthiness of such models is limited if generated trajectories are not physically plausible. For this reason we propose a physics-informed approach in which aircraft thrust and airspeed are learned from data and are used to condition the existing Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) model, which is physics-based and enforces energy-based constraints on generated trajectories. A set of informative features are identified and used to condition a probabilistic model of aircraft thrust and airspeed, with the proposed scheme demonstrating a 20% improvement in skilfulness across a set of six metrics, compared against a baseline probabilistic model that ignores contextual information such as meteorological conditions.

Title: Edit2Restore:Few-Shot Image Restoration via Parameter-Efficient Adaptation of Pre-trained Editing Models
Authors: M. Akın Yılmaz, Ahmet Bilican, Burak Can Biner, A. Murat Tekalp
Abstract: Image restoration has traditionally required training specialized models on thousands of paired examples per degradation type. We challenge this paradigm by demonstrating that powerful pre-trained text-conditioned image editing models can be efficiently adapted for multiple restoration tasks through parameter-efficient fine-tuning with remarkably few examples. Our approach fine-tunes LoRA adapters on FLUX.1 Kontext, a state-of-the-art 12B parameter flow matching model for image-to-image translation, using only 16-128 paired images per task, guided by simple text prompts that specify the restoration operation. Unlike existing methods that train specialized restoration networks from scratch with thousands of samples, we leverage the rich visual priors already encoded in large-scale pre-trained editing models, dramatically reducing data requirements while maintaining high perceptual quality. A single unified LoRA adapter, conditioned on task-specific text prompts, effectively handles multiple degradations including denoising, deraining, and dehazing. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we analyze: (i) the impact of training set size on restoration quality, (ii) trade-offs between task-specific versus unified multi-task adapters, (iii) the role of text encoder fine-tuning, and (iv) zero-shot baseline performance. While our method prioritizes perceptual quality over pixel-perfect reconstruction metrics like PSNR/SSIM, our results demonstrate that pre-trained image editing models, when properly adapted, offer a compelling and data-efficient alternative to traditional image restoration approaches, opening new avenues for few-shot, prompt-guided image enhancement.

Title: Current and temperature imbalances in parallel-connected grid storage battery modules
Authors: Joseph Ross, Damien Frost, Efstratios Chatzinikolaou, Stephen Duncan, David Howey
Abstract: A key challenge with large battery systems is heterogeneous currents and temperatures in modules with parallel-connected cells. Although extreme currents and temperatures are detrimental to the performance and lifetime of battery cells, there is not a consensus on the scale of typical imbalances within grid storage modules. Here, we quantify these imbalances through simulations and experiments on an industrially representative grid storage battery module consisting of prismatic lithium iron phosphate cells, elucidating the evolution of current and temperature imbalances and their dependence on individual cell and module parameter variations. Using a sensitivity analysis, we find that varying contact resistances and cell resistances contribute strongly to temperature differences between cells, from which we define safety thresholds on cell-to-cell variability. Finally, we investigate how these thresholds change for different applications, to outline a set of robustness metrics that show how cycling at lower C-rates and narrower SOC ranges can mitigate failures.

Title: Clustering-Based User Selection in Federated Learning: Metadata Exploitation for 3GPP Networks
Authors: Ce Zheng, Shiyao Ma, Ke Zhang, Chen Sun, Wenqi Zhang
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw user data, but conventional simulations often rely on unrealistic data partitioning and current user selection methods ignore data correlation among users. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a metadatadriven FL framework. We first introduce a novel data partition model based on a homogeneous Poisson point process (HPPP), capturing both heterogeneity in data quantity and natural overlap among user datasets. Building on this model, we develop a clustering-based user selection strategy that leverages metadata, such as user location, to reduce data correlation and enhance label diversity across training rounds. Extensive experiments on FMNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the proposed framework improves model performance, stability, and convergence in non-IID scenarios, while maintaining comparable performance under IID settings. Furthermore, the method shows pronounced advantages when the number of selected users per round is small. These findings highlight the framework's potential for enhancing FL performance in realistic deployments and guiding future standardization.

Title: VoiceSculptor: Your Voice, Designed By You

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in text-to-speech (TTS), open-source systems still lack truly instruction-following, fine-grained control over core speech attributes (e.g., pitch, speaking rate, age, emotion, and style). We present VoiceSculptor, an open-source unified system that bridges this gap by integrating instruction-based voice design and high-fidelity voice cloning in a single framework. It generates controllable speaker timbre directly from natural-language descriptions, supports iterative refinement via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and provides attribute-level edits across multiple dimensions. The designed voice is then rendered into a prompt waveform and fed into a cloning model to enable high-fidelity timbre transfer for downstream speech synthesis. VoiceSculptor achieves open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) on InstructTTSEval-Zh, and is fully open-sourced, including code and pretrained models, to advance reproducible instruction-controlled TTS research.

Title: RIS-aided Radar Detection Architectures with Application to Low-RCS Targets
Authors: Fabiola Colone, Filippo Costa, Yiding Gao, Chengpeng Hao, Linjie Yan, Giuliano Manara, Danilo Orlando
Abstract: In this paper, we address the radar detection of low observable targets with the assistance of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). Instead of using a multistatic radar network as counter-stealth strategy with its synchronization, costs, phase coherence, and energy consumption issues, we exploit a RIS to form a joint monostatic and bistatic configuration that can intercept the energy backscattered by the target along irrelevant directions different from the line-of-sight of the radar. Then, this energy is redirected towards the radar that capitalizes all the backscattered energy to detect the low observable target. To this end, five different detection architectures are devised that jointly process monostatic and bistatic echoes and exhibit the constant false alarm rate property at least with respect to the clutter power. To support the practical implementation, we also provide a guideline for the design of a RIS that satisfies the operating requirements of the considered application. The performance analysis is carried out in comparison with conventional detectors and shows that the proposed strategy leads to effective solutions to the detection of low observable targets.

Title: Invertibility Conditions for the Admittance Matrices of Balanced Power Systems
Authors: Daniel Turizo, Daniel K. Molzahn
Abstract: The admittance matrix encodes the network topology and electrical parameters of a power system in order to relate the current injection and voltage phasors. Since admittance matrices are central to many power engineering analyses, their characteristics are important subjects of theoretical studies. This paper focuses on the key characteristic of \emph{invertibility}. Previous literature has presented an invertibility condition for admittance matrices. This paper first identifies and fixes a technical issue in the proof of this previously presented invertibility condition. This paper then extends this previous work by deriving new conditions that are applicable to a broader class of systems with lossless branches and transformers with off-nominal tap ratios.

Title: 3D UAV Trajectory Design for Fair and Energy-Efficient Communication: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Technique
Authors: Shahid Rasool, Irfan Ullah, Abid Ali, Ishtiaq Ahmad
Abstract: In different situations, like disaster communication and network connectivity for rural locations, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could indeed be utilized as airborne base stations to improve both the functionality and coverage of communication networks. Ground users can employ mobile UAVs to establish communication channels and deliver packages. UAVs, on the other hand, have restricted transmission capabilities and fuel supplies. They can't always cover the full region or continue to fly for a long time, especially in a huge territory. Controlling a swarm of UAVs to yield a relatively long communication coverage while maintaining connectivity and limiting energy usage is so difficult. We use modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for UAV connectivity to provide an innovative and extremely energy-efficient DRL-based algorithm. The proposed method: 1) enhances novel energy efficiency while taking into account communications throughput, energy consumption, fairness, and connectivity; 2) evaluates the environment and its dynamics; and 3) makes judgments using strong deep neural networks. For performance evaluation, we have performed comprehensive simulations. In terms of energy consumption and fairness, simulation results show that the DRL-based algorithm consistently outperforms two commonly used baseline techniques.

Title: On the mixed monotonicity of polynomial functions
Authors: Adam M Tahir
Abstract: In this paper, it is shown that every polynomial function is mixed monotone globally with a polynomial decomposition function. For univariate polynomials, the decomposition functions can be constructed from the Gram matrix representation of polynomial functions. The tightness of polynomial decomposition functions is discussed. Several examples are provided. An example is provided to show that polynomial decomposition functions, in addition to being global decomposition functions, can be much tighter than local decomposition functions constructed using local Jacobian bounds. Furthermore, an example is provided to demonstrate the application to reachable set over-approximation.

Title: Virtual Holonomic and Nonholonomic Constraints on Lie groups
Authors: A. Anahory Simoes, A. Bloch, L. Colombo, E. Stratoglou
Abstract: This paper develops a geometric framework for virtual constraints on Lie groups, with emphasis on mechanical systems modeled as affine connection systems. Virtual holonomic and virtual nonholonomic constraints, including linear and affine nonholonomic constraints, are formulated directly at the level of the Lie algebra and characterized as feedback--invariant manifolds. For each class of constraint, we establish existence and uniqueness conditions for enforcing feedback laws and show that the resulting closed--loop trajectories evolve as the dynamics of mechanical systems endowed with induced constrained connections, generalizing classical holonomic and nonholonomic reductions. Beyond stabilization, the framework enables the systematic generation of low--dimensional motion primitives on Lie groups by enforcing invariant, possibly affine, manifolds and shaping nontrivial dynamical regimes. The approach is illustrated through representative examples, including quadrotor UAVs and a rigid body with an internal rotor, where classical control laws are recovered as special cases and affine constraint--induced motion primitives are obtained.

Title: Fusion of Quadratic Time-Frequency Analysis and Convolutional Neural Networks to Diagnose Bearing Faults Under Time-Varying Speeds
Authors: Mohammad Al-Sa'd, Tuomas Jalonen, Serkan Kiranyaz, Moncef Gabbouj
Abstract: Diagnosis of bearing faults is paramount to reducing maintenance costs and operational breakdowns. Bearing faults are primary contributors to machine vibrations, and analyzing their signal morphology offers insights into their health status. Unfortunately, existing approaches are optimized for controlled environments, neglecting realistic conditions such as time-varying rotational speeds and the vibration's non-stationary nature. This paper presents a fusion of time-frequency analysis and deep learning techniques to diagnose bearing faults under time-varying speeds and varying noise levels. First, we formulate the bearing fault-induced vibrations and discuss the link between their non-stationarity and the bearing's inherent and operational parameters. We also elucidate quadratic time-frequency distributions and validate their effectiveness in resolving distinctive dynamic patterns associated with different bearing faults. Based on this, we design a time-frequency convolutional neural network (TF-CNN) to diagnose various faults in rolling-element bearings. Our experimental findings undeniably demonstrate the superior performance of TF-CNN in comparison to recently developed techniques. They also assert its versatility in capturing fault-relevant non-stationary features that couple with speed changes and show its exceptional resilience to noise, consistently surpassing competing methods across various signal-to-noise ratios and performance metrics. Altogether, the TF-CNN achieves substantial accuracy improvements up to 15%, in severe noise conditions.

Title: Distribution Steering for Discrete-Time Uncertain Ensemble Systems
Authors: Guangyu Wu, Panagiotis Tsiotras, Anders Lindquist
Abstract: Ensemble systems appear frequently in many engineering applications and, as a result, they have become an important research topic in control theory. These systems are best characterized by the evolution of their underlying state distribution. Despite the work to date, few results exist dealing with the problem of directly modifying (i.e., ``steering'') the distribution of an ensemble system. In addition, in most existing results, the distribution of the states of an ensemble of discrete-time systems is assumed to be Gaussian. However, in case the system parameters are uncertain, it is not always realistic to assume that the distribution of the system follows a Gaussian distribution, thus complicating the solution of the overall problem. In this paper, we address the general distribution steering problem for first-order discrete-time ensemble systems, where the distributions of the system parameters and the states are arbitrary with finite first few moments. Linear system dynamics are considered using the method of power moments to transform the original infinite-dimensional problem into a finite-dimensional one. We also propose a control law for the ensuing moment system, which allows us to obtain the power moments of the desired control inputs. Finally, we solve the inverse problem to obtain the feasible control inputs from their corresponding power moments. We provide a numerical example to validate our theoretical developments.

Title: Multimodal Emotion Recognition using Audio-Video Transformer Fusion with Cross Attention
Authors: Joe Dhanith P R, Shravan Venkatraman, Vigya Sharma, Santhosh Malarvannan
Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) aims to infer human affect by jointly modeling audio and visual cues; however, existing approaches often struggle with temporal misalignment, weakly discriminative feature representations, and suboptimal fusion of heterogeneous modalities. To address these challenges, we propose AVT-CA, an Audio-Video Transformer architecture with cross attention for robust emotion recognition. The proposed model introduces a hierarchical video feature representation that combines channel attention, spatial attention, and local feature extraction to emphasize emotionally salient regions while suppressing irrelevant information. These refined visual features are integrated with audio representations through an intermediate transformer-based fusion mechanism that captures interlinked temporal dependencies across modalities. Furthermore, a cross-attention module selectively reinforces mutually consistent audio-visual cues, enabling effective feature selection and noise-aware fusion. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSEI, RAVDESS, and CREMA-D, demonstrate that AVT-CA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving significant improvements in both accuracy and F1-score.

Title: Towards a constructive framework for control theory
Authors: Pavel Osinenko
Abstract: This work presents a framework for control theory based on constructive analysis to account for discrepancy between mathematical results and their implementation in a computer, also referred to as computational uncertainty. In control engineering, the latter is usually either neglected or considered submerged into some other type of uncertainty, such as system noise, and addressed within robust control. However, even robust control methods may be compromised when the mathematical objects involved in the respective algorithms fail to exist in exact form and subsequently fail to satisfy the required properties. For instance, in general stabilization using a control Lyapunov function, computational uncertainty may distort stability certificates or even destabilize the system despite robustness of the stabilization routine with regards to system, actuator and measurement noise. In fact, battling numerical problems in practical implementation of controllers is common among control engineers. Such observations indicate that computational uncertainty should indeed be addressed explicitly in controller synthesis and system analysis. The major contribution here is a fairly general framework for proof techniques in analysis and synthesis of control systems based on constructive analysis which explicitly states that every computation be doable only up to a finite precision thus accounting for computational uncertainty. A series of previous works is overviewed, including constructive system stability and stabilization, approximate optimal controls, eigenvalue problems, Caratheodory trajectories, measurable selectors. Additionally, a new constructive version of the Danskin's theorem, which is crucial in adversarial defense, is presented.

Title: Dual-Domain Fusion for Semi-Supervised Learning
Authors: Tuomas Jalonen, Mohammad Al-Sa'd, Serkan Kiranyaz, Moncef Gabbouj
Abstract: Labeled time-series data is often expensive and difficult to obtain, making it challenging to train accurate machine learning models for real-world applications such as anomaly detection or fault diagnosis. The scarcity of labeled samples limits model generalization and leaves valuable unlabeled data underutilized. We propose Dual-Domain Fusion (DDF), a new model-agnostic semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework applicable to any time-series signal. DDF performs dual-domain training by combining the one-dimensional time-domain signals with their two-dimensional time-frequency representations and fusing them to maximize learning performance. Its tri-model architecture consists of time-domain, time-frequency, and fusion components, enabling the model to exploit complementary information across domains during training. To support practical deployment, DDF maintains the same inference cost as standard time-domain models by discarding the time-frequency and fusion branches at test time. Experimental results on two public fault diagnosis datasets demonstrate substantial accuracy improvements of 8-46% over widely used SSL methods FixMatch, MixMatch, Mean Teacher, Adversarial Training, and Self-training. These results show that DDF provides an effective and generalizable strategy for semi-supervised time-series classification.

Title: $k$-Inductive and Interpolation-Inspired Barrier Certificates for Stochastic Dynamical Systems
Authors: Mohammed Adib Oumer, Vishnu Murali, Majid Zamani
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce two new types of barrier certificates that are based on multiple functions rather than a single one. A conventional barrier certificate for a stochastic dynamical system is a nonnegative real-valued function whose expected value does not increase as the system evolves. This requirement guarantees that the barrier certificate forms a nonnegative supermartingale and can be used to derive a lower bound on the probability that the system remains safe. A key advantage of such certificates is that they can be automatically searched for using tools such as optimization programs instantiated with a fixed template. When this search is unsuccessful, the common practice is to modify the template and attempt the synthesis again. Drawing inspiration from logical interpolation, we first propose an alternative framework that uses a collection of functions to jointly serve as a barrier certificate. We refer to this construct as an interpolation-inspired barrier certificate. Nonetheless, we observe that these certificates still require one function in the collection to satisfy a supermartingale condition. Motivated by recent work in the literature, we next combine k-induction with interpolation-inspired certificates to relax this supermartingale constraint. We develop a general and more flexible notion of barrier certificates, which we call k-inductive interpolation-inspired barrier certificates. This formulation encompasses multiple ways of integrating interpolation-inspired barrier certificates with k-induction. We highlight two specific instantiations among these possible combinations. For polynomial systems, we employ sum-of-squares (SOS) programming to synthesize the corresponding set of functions. Finally, through our case studies, we show that the proposed methods enable the use of simpler templates and yield tighter lower bounds on the safety probability.

Title: ADMM-Based Training for Spiking Neural Networks
Authors: Giovanni Perin, Cesare Bidini, Riccardo Mazzieri, Michele Rossi
Abstract: In recent years, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained momentum due to their high potential in time-series processing combined with minimal energy consumption. However, they still lack a dedicated and efficient training algorithm. The popular backpropagation with surrogate gradients, adapted from stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-derived algorithms, has several drawbacks when used as an optimizer for SNNs. Specifically, the approximation introduced by the use of surrogate gradients leads to numerical imprecision, poor tracking of SNN firing times at training time, and, in turn, poor scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel SNN training method based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Our ADMM-based training aims to solve the problem of the SNN step function's non-differentiability by taking an entirely new approach with respect to gradient backpropagation. For the first time, we formulate the SNN training problem as an ADMM-based iterative optimization, derive closed-form updates, and empirically show the optimizer's convergence, its great potential, and discuss future and promising research directions to improve the method to different layer types and deeper architectures.

Title: ALPCAHUS: Subspace Clustering for Heteroscedastic Data
Authors: Javier Salazar Cavazos, Jeffrey A Fessler, Laura Balzano
Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a key tool in the field of data dimensionality reduction. Various methods have been proposed to extend PCA to the union of subspace (UoS) setting for clustering data that comes from multiple subspaces like K-Subspaces (KSS). However, some applications involve heterogeneous data that vary in quality due to noise characteristics associated with each data sample. Heteroscedastic methods aim to deal with such mixed data quality. This paper develops a heteroscedastic-based subspace clustering method, named ALPCAHUS, that can estimate the sample-wise noise variances and use this information to improve the estimate of the subspace bases associated with the low-rank structure of the data. This clustering algorithm builds on K-Subspaces (KSS) principles by extending the recently proposed heteroscedastic PCA method, named LR-ALPCAH, for clusters with heteroscedastic noise in the UoS setting. Simulations and real-data experiments show the effectiveness of accounting for data heteroscedasticity compared to existing clustering algorithms. Code available at this https URL.

Title: Rydberg Atomic Receivers for Multi-Band Communications and Sensing
Authors: Mingyao Cui, Qunsong Zeng, Minze Chen, Zhanwei Wang, Tianqi Mao, Dezhi Zheng, Kaibin Huang
Abstract: Harnessing multi-level electron transitions, Rydberg Atomic REceivers (RAREs) can detect wireless signals across a wide range of frequency bands, from Megahertz to Terahertz. This capability enables multi-band wireless communications and sensing (CommunSense). Existing research on multi-band RAREs primarily focuses on experimental demonstrations, lacking a tractable model to mathematically characterize their mechanisms. This issue leaves the multi-band RARE as a black box and poses challenges in its practical applications. To fill in this gap, this paper investigates the underlying mechanism of multiband RAREs and explores their optimal performance. For the first time, an analytical transfer function with a closed-form expression for multi-band RAREs is derived by solving the quantum response of Rydberg atoms. It shows that a multiband RARE simultaneously serves as a multi-band atomic mixer for down-converting multi-band signals and a multi-band atomic amplifier that reflects its sensitivity to each band. Further analysis of the atomic amplifier unveils that the intrinsic gain at each frequency band can be decoupled into a global gain term and a Rabi attention term. The former determines the overall sensitivity of a RARE to all frequency bands of wireless signals. The latter influences the allocation of the overall sensitivity to each frequency band, representing a unique attention mechanism of multi-band RAREs. The optimal design of the global gain is provided to maximize the overall sensitivity of multi-band RAREs. Subsequently, the optimal Rabi attentions are also derived to maximize the practical multi-band CommunSense performance. An experiment platform is built to validate the effectiveness of the derived transfer function, and numerical results confirm the superiority of multi-band RAREs.

Title: XMAD-Bench: Cross-Domain Multilingual Audio Deepfake Benchmark
Authors: Ioan-Paul Ciobanu, Andrei-Iulian Hiji, Nicolae-Catalin Ristea, Paul Irofti, Cristian Rusu, Radu Tudor Ionescu
Abstract: Recent advances in audio generation led to an increasing number of deepfakes, making the general public more vulnerable to financial scams, identity theft, and misinformation. Audio deepfake detectors promise to alleviate this issue, with many recent studies reporting accuracy rates close to 99%. However, these methods are typically tested in an in-domain setup, where the deepfake samples from the training and test sets are produced by the same generative models. To this end, we introduce XMAD-Bench, a large-scale cross-domain multilingual audio deepfake benchmark comprising 668.8 hours of real and deepfake speech. In our novel dataset, the speakers, the generative methods, and the real audio sources are distinct across training and test splits. This leads to a challenging cross-domain evaluation setup, where audio deepfake detectors can be tested "in the wild". Our in-domain and cross-domain experiments indicate a clear disparity between the in-domain performance of deepfake detectors, which is usually as high as 100%, and the cross-domain performance of the same models, which is sometimes similar to random chance. Our benchmark highlights the need for the development of robust audio deepfake detectors, which maintain their generalization capacity across different languages, speakers, generative methods, and data sources. Our benchmark is publicly released at this https URL.

Title: GLAP: General contrastive audio-text pretraining across domains and languages
Authors: Heinrich Dinkel, Zhiyong Yan, Tianzi Wang, Yongqing Wang, Xingwei Sun, Yadong Niu, Jizhong Liu, Gang Li, Junbo Zhang, Jian Luan
Abstract: Contrastive Language Audio Pretraining (CLAP) is a widely-used method to bridge the gap between audio and text domains. Current CLAP methods enable sound and music retrieval in English, ignoring multilingual spoken content. To address this, we introduce general language audio pretraining (GLAP), which expands CLAP with multilingual and multi-domain abilities. GLAP demonstrates its versatility by achieving competitive performance on standard audio-text retrieval benchmarks like Clotho and AudioCaps, while significantly surpassing existing methods in speech retrieval and classification tasks. Additionally, GLAP achieves strong results on widely used sound-event zero-shot benchmarks, while simultaneously outperforming previous methods on speech content benchmarks. Further keyword spotting evaluations across 50 languages emphasize GLAP's advanced multilingual capabilities. Finally, multilingual sound and music understanding is evaluated across four languages.

Abstract: Evaluating young children's language is challenging for automatic speech recognizers due to high-pitched voices, prolonged sounds, and limited data. We introduce K-Function, a framework that combines accurate sub-word transcription with objective, Large Language Model (LLM)-driven scoring. Its core, Kids-Weighted Finite State Transducer (K-WFST), merges an acoustic phoneme encoder with a phoneme-similarity model to capture child-specific speech errors while remaining fully interpretable. K-WFST achieves a 1.39 % phoneme error rate on MyST and 8.61 % on Multitudes-an absolute improvement of 10.47 % and 7.06 % over a greedy-search decoder. These high-quality transcripts are used by an LLM to grade verbal skills, developmental milestones, reading, and comprehension, with results that align closely with human evaluators. Our findings show that precise phoneme recognition is essential for creating an effective assessment framework, enabling scalable language screening for children.

Title: AI-Native Open RAN for Non-Terrestrial Networks: An Overview
Authors: Jikang Deng, S.Fizza Hassan, Hui Zhou, Saad Al-Ahmadi, Mohamed-Slim Alouini, Daniel B. Da Costa
Abstract: Non-terrestrial network (NTN) is envisioned as a critical component of Sixth Generation (6G) networks by enabling ubiquitous services and enhancing network resilience. However, the inherent mobility and high-altitude operation of NTN pose significant challenges throughout the development and operations (DevOps) lifecycle. To address these challenges, integrating NTNs with the Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) is a promising approach, since ORAN can offer disaggregation, openness, virtualization, and embedded intelligence. Despite extensive literature on ORAN and NTN, a holistic view of ORAN-based NTN frameworks is still lacking, particularly regarding how ORAN can effectively address the existing challenges of NTN. Furthermore, although artificial intelligence native (AI-Native) capabilities have the potential to enhance intelligence network control and optimization, their practical realization in NTNs has not yet been sufficiently investigated. Therefore, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive and structured overview of AI-Native ORAN for NTN. This paper commences with an in-depth review of the existing literature and subsequently introduces the necessary background about ORAN, NTN, and AI-Native for communication. After analyzing the DevOps challenges for NTN, we propose the orchestrated AI-Native ORAN-based NTN framework and discuss its key technological enablers. Finally, we present the representative use cases and outline the prospective future research directions of this study.

Title: Shared representations in brains and models reveal a two-route cortical organization during scene perception
Authors: Pablo Marcos-Manchón, Lluís Fuentemilla
Abstract: The brain transforms visual inputs into high-dimensional cortical representations that support diverse cognitive and behavioral goals. Characterizing how this information is organized and routed across the human brain is essential for understanding how we process complex visual scenes. Here, we applied representational similarity analysis to 7T fMRI data collected during natural scene viewing. We quantified representational geometry shared across individuals and compared it to hierarchical features from vision and language neural networks. This analysis revealed two distinct processing routes: a ventromedial pathway specialized for scene layout and environmental context, and a lateral occipitotemporal pathway selective for animate content. Vision models aligned with shared structure in both routes, whereas language models corresponded primarily with the lateral pathway. These findings refine classical visual-stream models by characterizing scene perception as a distributed cortical network with separable representational routes for context and animate content.

Title: Single-Step Reconstruction-Free Anomaly Detection and Segmentation via Diffusion Models
Authors: Mehrdad Moradi, Marco Grasso, Bianca Maria Colosimo, Kamran Paynabar
Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated significant success in anomaly detection and segmentation over the past decade. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and VAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on normal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a predefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The corresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse sampling. However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1) the reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple sampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or subtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal pattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate intermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and often assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in unsupervised settings. We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based diffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of reconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that reconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the diffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational efficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the MVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and statistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on MVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best model. Code available at: this https URL

Title: TurnGuide: Enhancing Meaningful Full Duplex Spoken Interactions via Dynamic Turn-Level Text-Speech Interleaving
Authors: Wenqian Cui, Lei Zhu, Xiaohui Li, Zhihan Guo, Haoli Bai, Lu Hou, Irwin King
Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech Language Models (FD-SLMs) are specialized foundation models designed to enable natural, real-time spoken interactions by modeling complex conversational turn-taking such as interruptions, backchannels, and overlapping speech. End-to-end (e2e) FD-SLMs leverage real-world double-channel conversational data to capture nuanced two-speaker dialogue patterns for human-like interactions, but their conversational abilities often degrade compared to pure-text conversation due to prolonged speech sequences and limited high-quality spoken dialogue data. Although interleaved text-speech generation could mitigate this degradation, integrating discrete text tokens into continuous double-channel audio streams could disrupt the precise time alignment required for fluid interaction. To address this, we propose TurnGuide, a novel text-speech interleaved generation approach for e2e FD-SLMs that dynamically segments assistant speech into dialogue turns and interleaves turn-level text and speech generation. This approach allows FD-SLMs to integrate the semantic intelligence of LLMs without compromising the natural acoustic flow. Extensive experiments show that TurnGuide not only significantly improves e2e FD-SLMs to produce semantically meaningful, coherent speech but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on various turn-taking events.

Title: High-Capacity and Low-PAPR BICM-OFDM Systems Using Non-Equiprobable and Non-Uniform Constellation Shaping With Clipping and Filtering
Authors: Eito Kurihara, Hideki Ochiai
Abstract: We address a design of high-capacity and low-peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems based on bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) utilizing non-equiprobable and non-uniform (NENU) constellations as well as clipping and filtering (CAF). The proposed constellations are generated using a truncated Gaussian distribution and the merging of constellation points, where the former creates a non-uniform constellation (NUC), and the latter adjusts the number of signal points for further improving the total bit-wise mutual information (BMI). Unlike other exhaustive search-based approaches, the proposed constellations are uniquely determined by only two parameters associated with NUC and cardinality. Due to this property of limited degrees of freedom, the complexity required for the numerical optimization process can be significantly low. We focus on the constellation design based on one dimension, i.e., pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), which facilitates the reduction of demapping complexity for the BICM receiver. The use of CAF at the transmitter can efficiently reduce the PAPR of OFDM signals; however, it introduces clipping noise that may degrade error rate performance, making the application of clipping noise cancellation (CNC) at the receiver essential. Therefore, we optimize the NENU constellations in the presence of CAF and CNC. Simulation results demonstrate that the combination of constellation shaping with CAF and CNC enables BICM-OFDM systems to simultaneously achieve low PAPR and high spectral efficiency over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) as well as frequency-selective fading channels. Furthermore, comparative studies confirm that the proposed system significantly outperforms the single-carrier counterpart (i.e., DFT-precoded BICM-OFDM) in terms of PAPR and bit error rate (BER) performance over fading channels.

Title: Can the Waymo Open Motion Dataset Support Realistic Behavioral Modeling? A Validation Study with Naturalistic Trajectories
Authors: Yanlin Zhang, Sungyong Chung, Nachuan Li, Dana Monzer, Hani S. Mahmassani, Samer H. Hamdar, Alireza Talebpour
Abstract: The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for data-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its validity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary post-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of trajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately captures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations. Leveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV operations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across three representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized intersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging analysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure negligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we apply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically estimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to quantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show that behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably, WOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings suggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically underestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving. Caution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without proper validation against independently collected data.

Title: Robustness of quantum algorithms: Worst-case fidelity bounds and implications for design
Authors: Julian Berberich, Tobias Fellner, Robert L. Kosut, Christian Holm
Abstract: Errors occurring on noisy hardware pose a key challenge to reliable quantum computing. Existing techniques such as error correction, mitigation, or suppression typically separate the error handling from the algorithm analysis and design. In this paper, we develop an alternative, algorithm-centered framework for understanding and improving the robustness against errors. For a given quantum algorithm and error model, we derive worst-case fidelity bounds which can be efficiently computed to certify the robustness. We consider general error models including coherent and (Markovian) incoherent errors and allowing for set-based error descriptions to address uncertainty or time-dependence in the errors. Our results give rise to guidelines for robust algorithm design and compilation by optimizing our theoretical robustness measure. We demonstrate the practicality of the framework with numerical results on algorithm analysis and robust optimization, including the robustness analysis of a 50-qubit modular adder circuit.

Title: How Does Instrumental Music Help SingFake Detection?
Authors: Xuanjun Chen, Chia-Yu Hu, I-Ming Lin, Yi-Cheng Lin, I-Hsiang Chiu, You Zhang, Sung-Feng Huang, Yi-Hsuan Yang, Haibin Wu, Hung-yi Lee, Jyh-Shing Roger Jang
Abstract: Although many models exist to detect singing voice deepfakes (SingFake), how these models operate, particularly with instrumental accompaniment, is unclear. We investigate how instrumental music affects SingFake detection from two perspectives. To investigate the behavioral effect, we test different backbones, unpaired instrumental tracks, and frequency subbands. To analyze the representational effect, we probe how fine-tuning alters encoders' speech and music capabilities. Our results show that instrumental accompaniment acts mainly as data augmentation rather than providing intrinsic cues (e.g., rhythm or harmony). Furthermore, fine-tuning increases reliance on shallow speaker features while reducing sensitivity to content, paralinguistic, and semantic information. These insights clarify how models exploit vocal versus instrumental cues and can inform the design of more interpretable and robust SingFake detection systems.

Title: Message passing-based inference in an autoregressive active inference agent
Authors: Wouter M. Kouw, Tim N. Nisslbeck, Wouter L.N. Nuijten
Abstract: We present the design of an autoregressive active inference agent in the form of message passing on a factor graph. Expected free energy is derived and distributed across a planning graph. The proposed agent is validated on a robot navigation task, demonstrating exploration and exploitation in a continuous-valued observation space with bounded continuous-valued actions. Compared to a classical optimal controller, the agent modulates action based on predictive uncertainty, arriving later but with a better model of the robot's dynamics.

Title: Anti-Jamming based on Beam-Steering Antennas and Intelligent UAV Swarm Behavior
Authors: Tiago Silva, António Grilo
Abstract: In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have brought a new true revolution to military tactics. While UAVs already constitute an advantage when operating alone, multi-UAV swarms expand the available possibilities, allowing the UAVs to collaborate and support each other as a team to carry out a given task. This entails the capability to exchange information related with situation awareness and action coordination by means of a suitable wireless communication technology. In such scenario, the adversary is expected to disrupt communications by jamming the communication channel. The latter becomes the Achilles heel of the swarm. While anti-jamming techniques constitute a well covered topic in the literature, the use of intelligent swarm behaviors to leverage those techniques is still an open research issue. This paper explores the use of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to jointly optimize UAV swarm formation, beam-steering antennas and traffic routing in order to mitigate the effect of jamming in the main coordination channel, under the assumption that a more robust and low data rate channel is used for formation management signaling. Simulation results show the effectiveness of proposed approach. However, the significant computational cost paves the way for further research.

Title: A Stage-Wise Learning Strategy with Fixed Anchors for Robust Speaker Verification
Authors: Bin Gu, Lipeng Dai, Huipeng Du, Haitao Zhao, Jibo Wei
Abstract: Learning robust speaker representations under noisy conditions presents significant challenges, which requires careful handling of both discriminative and noise-invariant properties. In this work, we proposed an anchor-based stage-wise learning strategy for robust speaker representation learning. Specifically, our approach begins by training a base model to establish discriminative speaker boundaries, and then extract anchor embeddings from this model as stable references. Finally, a copy of the base model is fine-tuned on noisy inputs, regularized by enforcing proximity to their corresponding fixed anchor embeddings to preserve speaker identity under distortion. Experimental results suggest that this strategy offers advantages over conventional joint optimization, particularly in maintaining discrimination while improving noise robustness. The proposed method demonstrates consistent improvements across various noise conditions, potentially due to its ability to handle boundary stabilization and variation suppression separately.

Title: Resting-State EEG Network Profiles Associated with Creative Engagement and Creative Self-Efficacy
Authors: Samir Damji, Simrut Kurry, Shazia'Ayn Babul, Joydeep Bhattacharya, Naznin Virji-Babul
Abstract: Creativity is a core cognitive capacity underlying innovation and adaptive problem solving, yet how it is represented in the brain's intrinsic functional architecture is not fully understood. While resting-state fMRI studies have identified large-scale network correlates associated with differences in creativity, EEG provides the temporal resolution for examining oscillatory dynamics contributing to intrinsic network organization. We examined whether resting-state EEG connectivity patterns are associated with individual differences across multiple creativity-related measures. Thirty healthy young adults completed a multidimensional creativity battery comprising the Inventory of Creative Activities and Achievements (ICAA), the Divergent Association Task (DAT), the Matchstick Arithmetic Puzzles Task (MAPT) and a Self-rating (SR) of creative ability. Graph-theoretical analyses of alpha-band functional connectivity revealed two participant groups, each with distinct patterns of neural activity: Cluster 1 showed reduced global connectivity with relatively preserved left frontal connectivity and greater network modularity; Cluster 0 exhibited stronger overall connectivity strength, reduced modularity and higher local clustering. Notably, Cluster 1 reported higher self-rated creative ability and more frequent engagement in real-world creative activities. These findings suggest that resting-state EEG connectivity patterns are associated with variation in creative self-efficacy and creative engagement, highlighting characteristic patterns of alpha-band network organization observed at rest.

Title: Numerical Spectrum Linking: Identification of Governing PDE via Koopman-Chebyshev Approximation
Authors: Phonepaserth Sisaykeo, Shogo Muramatsu
Abstract: A numerical framework is proposed for identifying partial differential equations (PDEs) governing dynamical systems directly from their observation data using Chebyshev polynomial approximation. In contrast to data-driven approaches such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which approximate the Koopman operator without a clear connection to differential operators, the proposed method constructs finite-dimensional Koopman matrices by projecting the dynamics onto a Chebyshev basis, thereby capturing both differential and nonlinear terms. This establishes a numerical link between the Koopman and differential operators. Numerical experiments on benchmark dynamical systems confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the approach, underscoring its potential for interpretable operator learning. The framework also lays a foundation for future integration with symbolic regression, enabling the construction of explicit mathematical models directly from data.

Title: Fun-Audio-Chat Technical Report
Authors: Tongyi Fun Team, Qian Chen, Luyao Cheng, Chong Deng, Xiangang Li, Jiaqing Liu, Chao-Hong Tan, Wen Wang, Junhao Xu, Jieping Ye, Qinglin Zhang, Qiquan Zhang, Jingren Zhou
Abstract: Recent advancements in joint speech-text models show great potential for seamless voice interactions. However, existing models face critical challenges: temporal resolution mismatch between speech tokens (25Hz) and text tokens (~3Hz) dilutes semantic information, incurs high computational costs, and causes catastrophic forgetting of text LLM knowledge. We introduce Fun-Audio-Chat, a Large Audio Language Model addressing these limitations via two innovations from our previous work DrVoice. First, Dual-Resolution Speech Representations (DRSR): the Shared LLM processes audio at efficient 5Hz (via token grouping), while the Speech Refined Head generates high-quality tokens at 25Hz, balancing efficiency (~50% GPU reduction) and quality. Second, Core-Cocktail Training, a two-stage fine-tuning with intermediate merging that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. We then apply Multi-Task DPO Training to enhance robustness, audio understanding, instruction-following and voice empathy. This multi-stage post-training enables Fun-Audio-Chat to retain text LLM knowledge while gaining powerful audio understanding, reasoning, and generation. Unlike recent LALMs requiring large-scale audio-text pre-training, Fun-Audio-Chat leverages pre-trained models and extensive post-training. Fun-Audio-Chat 8B and MoE 30B-A3B achieve competitive performance on Speech-to-Text and Speech-to-Speech tasks, ranking top among similar-scale models on Spoken QA benchmarks. They also achieve competitive to superior performance on Audio Understanding, Speech Function Calling, Instruction-Following and Voice Empathy. We develop Fun-Audio-Chat-Duplex, a full-duplex variant with strong performance on Spoken QA and full-duplex interactions. We open-source Fun-Audio-Chat-8B with training and inference code, and provide an interactive demo, at this https URL .

Title: Improved cystic hygroma detection from prenatal imaging using ultrasound-specific self-supervised representation learning
Authors: Youssef Megahed, Robin Ducharme, Inok Lee, Inbal Willner, Adrian D. C. Chan, Mark Walker, Steven Hawken
Abstract: Cystic hygroma is a high-risk prenatal ultrasound finding that portends high rates of chromosomal abnormalities, structural malformations, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Automated detection can increase reproducibility and support scalable early screening programs, but supervised deep learning methods are limited by small labelled datasets. This study assesses whether ultrasound-specific self-supervised pretraining can facilitate accurate, robust deep learning detection of cystic hygroma in first-trimester ultrasound images. We fine-tuned the Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), pretrained on over 370,000 unlabelled ultrasound images, for binary classification of normal controls and cystic hygroma cases used in this study. Performance was evaluated on the same curated ultrasound dataset, preprocessing pipeline, and 4-fold cross-validation protocol as for the DenseNet-169 baseline, using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). Model interpretability was analyzed qualitatively using Score-CAM visualizations. USF-MAE outperformed the DenseNet-169 baseline on all evaluation metrics. The proposed model yielded a mean accuracy of 0.96, sensitivity of 0.94, specificity of 0.98, and ROC-AUC of 0.98 compared to 0.93, 0.92, 0.94, and 0.94 for the DenseNet-169 baseline, respectively. Qualitative Score-CAM visualizations of model predictions demonstrated clinical relevance by highlighting expected regions in the fetal neck for both positive and negative cases. Paired statistical analysis using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test confirmed that performance improvements achieved by USF-MAE were statistically significant (p = 0.0057).

Title: Covering in Hamming and Grassmann Spaces: New Bounds and Reed--Solomon-Based Constructions
Authors: Samin Riasat, Hessam Mahdavifar
Abstract: We study covering problems in Hamming and Grassmann spaces through a unified coding-theoretic and information-theoretic framework. Viewing covering as a form of quantization in general metric spaces, we introduce the notion of the average covering radius as a natural measure of average distortion, complementing the classical worst-case covering radius. By leveraging tools from one-shot rate-distortion theory, we derive explicit non-asymptotic random-coding bounds on the average covering radius in both spaces, which serve as fundamental performance benchmarks. On the construction side, we develop efficient puncturing-based covering algorithms for generalized Reed--Solomon (GRS) codes in the Hamming space and extend them to a new family of subspace codes, termed character-Reed--Solomon (CRS) codes, for Grassmannian quantization under the chordal distance. Our results reveal that, despite poor worst-case covering guarantees, these structured codes exhibit strong average covering performance. In particular, numerical results in the Hamming space demonstrate that RS-based constructions often outperform random codebooks in terms of average covering radius. In the one-dimensional Grassmann space, we numerically show that CRS codes over prime fields asymptotically achieve average covering radii within a constant factor of the random-coding bound in the high-rate regime. Together, these results provide new insights into the role of algebraic structure in covering problems and high-dimensional quantization.

Title: MOSS Transcribe Diarize Technical Report

Abstract: Speaker-Attributed, Time-Stamped Transcription (SATS) aims to transcribe what is said and to precisely determine the timing of each speaker, which is particularly valuable for meeting transcription. Existing SATS systems rarely adopt an end-to-end formulation and are further constrained by limited context windows, weak long-range speaker memory, and the inability to output timestamps. To address these limitations, we present MOSS Transcribe Diarize, a unified multimodal large language model that jointly performs Speaker-Attributed, Time-Stamped Transcription in an end-to-end paradigm. Trained on extensive real wild data and equipped with a 128k context window for up to 90-minute inputs, MOSS Transcribe Diarize scales well and generalizes robustly. Across comprehensive evaluations, it outperforms state-of-the-art commercial systems on multiple public and in-house benchmarks.

Title: System Availability Optimization: Integrating Quantity Discounts and Delivery Lead Time Considerations
Authors: Zahra Sobhani, Mahmoud Shahrokhi
Abstract: Purpose: The model allocates the system components orders to the suppliers to minimize the parts price and the system construction delay penalties and maximize the system availability during its use. It considers the quantity-based discount and variation of delivery lead time by ordering similar components. The model also reflects the prerequisite relationships between construction activities and calculates the delay penalty resulting from parts delivery lead time. Design/methodology/approach: This research presents a model for selecting suppliers of components of an industrial series-parallel multi-state system. A nonlinear binary mathematical program uses the Markov process results to select system components. It minimizes the total system construction phase costs, including the components' price, and the system construction delay penalty, and the system exploitation phase costs, including the system shutdown and working at half capacity. Findings: The model allocates the optimal orders for a typical industrial system's components, composing four elements. The proposed approach combines the nonlinear binary program and the Markov process results to optimize the system life cycle parameters, including the system construction cost and operational availability. Originality/value: Using the Markov chain results in binary nonlinear mathematical programming, this study attempts to strike the right balance between the construction phase's objectives and an industrial unit's operation phase.

Title: SRAW-Attack: Space-Reweighted Adversarial Warping Attack for SAR Target Recognition
Authors: Yiming Zhang, Weibo Qin, Yuntian Liu, Feng Wang
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery exhibits intrinsic information sparsity due to its unique electromagnetic scattering mechanism. Despite the widespread adoption of deep neural network (DNN)-based SAR automatic target recognition (SAR-ATR) systems, they remain vulnerable to adversarial examples and tend to over-rely on background regions, leading to degraded adversarial robustness. Existing adversarial attacks for SAR-ATR often require visually perceptible distortions to achieve effective performance, thereby necessitating an attack method that balances effectiveness and stealthiness. In this paper, a novel attack method termed Space-Reweighted Adversarial Warping (SRAW) is proposed, which generates adversarial examples through optimized spatial deformation with reweighted budgets across foreground and background regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRAW significantly degrades the performance of state-of-the-art SAR-ATR models and consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of imperceptibility and adversarial transferability.

Title: Efficient Channel Autoencoders for Wideband Communications leveraging Walsh-Hadamard interleaving
Authors: Cel Thys, Rodney Martinez Alonso, Sofie Pollin
Abstract: This paper investigates how end-to-end (E2E) channel autoencoders (AEs) can achieve energy-efficient wideband communications by leveraging Walsh-Hadamard (WH) interleaved converters. WH interleaving enables high sampling rate analog-digital conversion with reduced power consumption using an analog WH transformation. We demonstrate that E2E-trained neural coded modulation can transparently adapt to the WH-transceiver hardware without requiring algorithmic redesign. Focusing on the short block length regime, we train WH-domain AEs and benchmark them against standard neural and conventional baselines, including 5G Polar codes. We quantify the system-level energy tradeoffs among baseband compute, channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and analog converter power. Our analysis shows that the proposed WH-AE system can approach conventional Polar code SNR performance within 0.14dB while consuming comparable or lower system power. Compared to the best neural baseline, WH-AE achieves, on average, 29% higher energy efficiency (in bit/J) for the same reliability. These findings establish WH-domain learning as a viable path to energy-efficient, high-throughput wideband communications by explicitly balancing compute complexity, SNR, and analog power consumption.
