Title: Model-Driven Deep Neural Network for Enhanced AoA Estimation Using 5G gNB
Authors: Shengheng Liu, Xingkang Li, Zihuan Mao, Peng Liu, Yongming Huang
Abstract: High-accuracy positioning has become a fundamental enabler for intelligent connected devices. Nevertheless, the present wireless networks still rely on model-driven approaches to achieve positioning functionality, which are susceptible to performance degradation in practical scenarios, primarily due to hardware impairments. Integrating artificial intelligence into the positioning framework presents a promising solution to revolutionize the accuracy and robustness of location-based services. In this study, we address this challenge by reformulating the problem of angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation into image reconstruction of spatial spectrum. To this end, we design a model-driven deep neural network (MoD-DNN), which can automatically calibrate the angular-dependent phase error. The proposed MoD-DNN approach employs an iterative optimization scheme between a convolutional neural network and a sparse conjugate gradient algorithm. Simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing spectrum calibration and AoA estimation.

Title: LoRaFlow: High-Quality Signal Reconstruction using Rectified Flow
Authors: Mohamed Osman, Tamer Nadeem
Abstract: LoRa technology, crucial for low-power wide-area networks, faces significant performance degradation at extremely low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We present LoRaFlow, a novel approach using rectified flow to reconstruct high-quality LoRa signals in challenging noise conditions. Unlike existing neural-enhanced methods focused on classification, LoRaFlow recovers the signal itself, maintaining compatibility with standard dechirp algorithms. Our method combines a hybrid neural network architecture, synthetic data generation, and robust augmentation strategies. This minimally invasive enhancement to LoRa infrastructure potentially extends operational range and reliability without overhauling existing systems. LoRaFlow opens new possibilities for robust IoT communications in harsh environments and its core methodology can be generalized to support various communication technologies.

Title: Speech Recognition With LLMs Adapted to Disordered Speech Using Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Chirag Nagpal, Subhashini Venugopalan, Jimmy Tobin, Marilyn Ladewig, Katherine Heller, Katrin Tomanek
Abstract: We introduce a large language model (LLM) capable of processing speech inputs and show that tuning it further with reinforcement learning on human preference (RLHF) enables it to adapt better to disordered speech than traditional fine-tuning. Our method replaces low-frequency text tokens in an LLM's vocabulary with audio tokens and enables the model to recognize speech by fine-tuning it on speech with transcripts. We then use RL with rewards based on syntactic and semantic accuracy measures generalizing the LLM further to recognize disordered speech. While the resulting LLM does not outperform existing systems for speech recognition, we find that tuning with reinforcement learning using custom rewards leads to substantially better performance than supervised fine-tuning of the language model, specifically when adapting to speech in a different setting. This presents a compelling alternative tuning strategy for speech recognition using large language models.

Title: Implementing Trust in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Diagnosis with a Conformalized Uncertainty-Aware AI Framework in Whole-Slide Images
Authors: Xiaoge Zhang, Tao Wang, Chao Yan, Fedaa Najdawi, Kai Zhou, Yuan Ma, Yiu-ming Cheung, Bradley A. Malin
Abstract: Ensuring trustworthiness is fundamental to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) that is considered societally responsible, particularly in cancer diagnostics, where a misdiagnosis can have dire consequences. Current digital pathology AI models lack systematic solutions to address trustworthiness concerns arising from model limitations and data discrepancies between model deployment and development environments. To address this issue, we developed TRUECAM, a framework designed to ensure both data and model trustworthiness in non-small cell lung cancer subtyping with whole-slide images. TRUECAM integrates 1) a spectral-normalized neural Gaussian process for identifying out-of-scope inputs and 2) an ambiguity-guided elimination of tiles to filter out highly ambiguous regions, addressing data trustworthiness, as well as 3) conformal prediction to ensure controlled error rates. We systematically evaluated the framework across multiple large-scale cancer datasets, leveraging both task-specific and foundation models, illustrate that an AI model wrapped with TRUECAM significantly outperforms models that lack such guidance, in terms of classification accuracy, robustness, interpretability, and data efficiency, while also achieving improvements in fairness. These findings highlight TRUECAM as a versatile wrapper framework for digital pathology AI models with diverse architectural designs, promoting their responsible and effective applications in real-world settings.

Title: Modelling and Control of Spatial Behaviours in Multi-Agent Systems with Applications to Biology and Robotics
Authors: Andrea Giusti
Abstract: Large-Scale Multi-Agent Systems (LS-MAS) consist of several autonomous components, interacting in a non-trivial way, so that the emerging behaviour of the ensemble depends on the individual dynamics of the components and their reciprocal interactions. These models can describe a rich variety of natural systems, as well as artificial ones, characterised by unparalleled scalability, robustness, and flexibility. Indeed, a crucial objective is devising efficient strategies to model and control the spatial behaviours of LS-MAS to achieve specific goals. However, the inherent complexity of these systems and the wide spectrum of their emerging behaviours pose significant challenges. The overarching goal of this thesis is, therefore, to advance methods for modelling, analyzing and controlling the spatial behaviours of LS-MAS, with applications to cellular populations and swarm robotics. The thesis begins with an overview of the existing Literature, and is then organized into two distinct parts. In the context of swarm robotics, Part I deals with distributed control algorithms to spatially organize agents on geometric patterns. The contribution is twofold, encompassing both the development of original control algorithms, and providing a novel formal analysis, which allows to guarantee the emergence of specific geometric patterns. In Part II, looking at the spatial behaviours of biological agents, experiments are carried out to study the movement of microorganisms and their response to light stimuli. This allows the derivation and parametrization of mathematical models that capture these behaviours, and pave the way for the development of innovative approaches for the spatial control of microorganisms. The results presented in the thesis were developed by leveraging formal analytical tools, simulations, and experiments, using innovative platforms and original computational frameworks.

Title: DiCoW: Diarization-Conditioned Whisper for Target Speaker Automatic Speech Recognition
Authors: Alexander Polok, Dominik Klement, Martin Kocour, Jiangyu Han, Federico Landini, Bolaji Yusuf, Matthew Wiesner, Sanjeev Khudanpur, Jan Černocký, Lukáš Burget
Abstract: Speaker-attributed automatic speech recognition (ASR) in multi-speaker environments remains a significant challenge, particularly when systems conditioned on speaker embeddings fail to generalize to unseen speakers. In this work, we propose Diarization-Conditioned Whisper (DiCoW), a novel approach to target-speaker ASR that leverages speaker diarization outputs as conditioning information. DiCoW extends the pre-trained Whisper model by integrating diarization labels directly, eliminating reliance on speaker embeddings and reducing the need for extensive speaker-specific training data. Our method introduces frame-level diarization-dependent transformations (FDDT) and query-key biasing (QKb) techniques to refine the model's focus on target speakers while effectively handling overlapping speech. By leveraging diarization outputs as conditioning signals, DiCoW simplifies the workflow for multi-speaker ASR, improves generalization to unseen speakers and enables more reliable transcription in real-world multi-speaker recordings. Additionally, we explore the integration of a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) head to Whisper and demonstrate its ability to improve transcription efficiency through hybrid decoding. Notably, we show that our approach is not limited to Whisper; it also provides similar benefits when applied to the Branchformer model. We validate DiCoW on real-world datasets, including AMI and NOTSOFAR-1 from CHiME-8 challenge, as well as synthetic benchmarks such as Libri2Mix and LibriCSS, enabling direct comparisons with previous methods. Results demonstrate that DiCoW enhances the model's target-speaker ASR capabilities while maintaining Whisper's accuracy and robustness on single-speaker data.

Title: Tackling Cognitive Impairment Detection from Speech: A submission to the PROCESS Challenge
Authors: Catarina Botelho, David Gimeno-Gómez, Francisco Teixeira, John Mendonça, Patrícia Pereira, Diogo A.P. Nunes, Thomas Rolland, Anna Pompili, Rubén Solera-Ureña, Maria Ponte, David Martins de Matos, Carlos-D. Martínez-Hinarejos, Isabel Trancoso, Alberto Abad
Abstract: This work describes our group's submission to the PROCESS Challenge 2024, with the goal of assessing cognitive decline through spontaneous speech, using three guided clinical tasks. This joint effort followed a holistic approach, encompassing both knowledge-based acoustic and text-based feature sets, as well as LLM-based macrolinguistic descriptors, pause-based acoustic biomarkers, and multiple neural representations (e.g., LongFormer, ECAPA-TDNN, and Trillson embeddings). Combining these feature sets with different classifiers resulted in a large pool of models, from which we selected those that provided the best balance between train, development, and individual class performance. Our results show that our best performing systems correspond to combinations of models that are complementary to each other, relying on acoustic and textual information from all three clinical tasks.

Title: On Functional Observability of Nonlinear Systems and the Design of Functional Observers with Assignable Error Dynamics
Authors: Costas Kravaris
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for designing functional observers for nonlinear systems, with linear error dynamics and assignable poles. Sufficient conditions for functional observability are first derived, leading to functional relationships between the Lie derivatives of the output to be estimated and the ones of the measured output. These are directly used in the proposed design of the functional observer. The functional observer is defined in differential input-output form, satisfying an appropriate invariance condition that emerges from the state-space invariance conditions of the literature. A concept of functional observer index is also proposed, to characterize the lowest feasible order of functional observer with pole assignment. Two chemical reactor applications are used to illustrate the proposed approach.

Title: Hierarchical Functionality Prioritization in Multicast ISAC: Optimal Admission Control and Discrete-Phase Beamforming
Authors: Luis F. Abanto-Leon, Setareh Maghsudi
Abstract: We investigate the joint admission control and discrete-phase multicast beamforming design for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, where sensing and communications functionalities have different hierarchies. Specifically, the ISAC system first allocates resources to the higher-hierarchy functionality and opportunistically uses the remaining resources to support the lower-hierarchy one. This resource allocation problem is a nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). We propose an exact mixed-integer linear program (MILP) reformulation, leading to a globally optimal solution. In addition, we implemented three baselines for comparison, which our proposed method outperforms by more than 39%.

Title: Distributed Traffic Control in Complex Dynamic Roadblocks: A Multi-Agent Deep RL Approach
Authors: Noor Aboueleneen, Yahuza Bello, Abdullatif Albaseer, Ahmed Refaey Hussein, Mohamed Abdallah, Ekram Hossain
Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) represent a transformative advancement in the transportation industry. These vehicles have sophisticated sensors, advanced algorithms, and powerful computing systems that allow them to navigate and operate without direct human intervention. However, AVs' systems still get overwhelmed when they encounter a complex dynamic change in the environment resulting from an accident or a roadblock for maintenance. The advanced features of Sixth Generation (6G) technology are set to offer strong support to AVs, enabling real-time data exchange and management of complex driving maneuvers. This paper proposes a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework to improve AVs' decision-making in dynamic and complex Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) utilizing 6G-V2X communication. The primary objective is to enable AVs to avoid roadblocks efficiently by changing lanes while maintaining optimal traffic flow and maximizing the mean harmonic speed. To ensure realistic operations, key constraints such as minimum vehicle speed, roadblock count, and lane change frequency are integrated. We train and test the proposed MARL model with two traffic simulation scenarios using the SUMO and TraCI interface. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed model adapts to various traffic conditions and achieves efficient and robust traffic flow management. The trained model effectively navigates dynamic roadblocks, promoting improved traffic efficiency in AV operations with more than 70% efficiency over other benchmark solutions.

Title: Autonomous Minibus Service with Semi-on-demand Routes in Grid Networks
Authors: Max T.M. Ng, Hani S. Mahmassani
Abstract: This paper investigates the potential of autonomous minibuses which take on-demand directional routes for pick-up and drop-off in a grid network of wider area with low density, followed by fixed routes in areas with demand. Mathematical formulation for generalized costs demonstrates its benefits, with indicators proposed to select existing bus routes for conversion with the options of zonal express and parallel routes. Simulations on modeled scenarios and case studies with bus routes in Chicago show reductions in both passenger costs and generalized costs over existing fixed-route bus service between suburban areas and CBD.

Title: Automotive Speed Estimation: Sensor Types and Error Characteristics from OBD-II to ADAS
Authors: Hany Ragab (1), Sidney Givigi (2), Aboelmagd Noureldin (1 and 2) ((1) Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Queens University and the NavINST Lab at the Royal Military College of Canada, (2) School of Computing at Queens University)
Abstract: Modern on-road navigation systems heavily depend on integrating speed measurements with inertial navigation systems (INS) and global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). Telemetry-based applications typically source speed data from the On-Board Diagnostic II (OBD-II) system. However, the method of deriving speed, as well as the types of sensors used to measure wheel speed, differs across vehicles. These differences result in varying error characteristics that must be accounted for in navigation and autonomy applications. This paper addresses this gap by examining the diverse speed-sensing technologies employed in standard automotive systems and alternative techniques used in advanced systems designed for higher levels of autonomy, such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), Autonomous Driving (AD), or surveying applications. We propose a method to identify the type of speed sensor in a vehicle and present strategies for accurately modeling its error characteristics. To validate our approach, we collected and analyzed data from three long real road trajectories conducted in urban environments in Toronto and Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The results underscore the critical role of integrating multiple sensor modalities to achieve more accurate speed estimation, thus improving automotive navigation state estimation, particularly in GNSS-denied environments.

Title: A Universal Controller for Grid-Tied Inverters
Authors: Fariba Fateh
Abstract: This paper presents the development of "Control-Sync," a novel firmware for universal inverters in microgrids, designed to enhance grid stability and flexibility. As hybrid PV-battery systems become increasingly prevalent, there is a critical need for inverters capable of efficiently transitioning between grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) modes. Our firmware introduces dual control paths that allow for seamless transitions without reliance on external control devices, reducing communication overhead and increasing operational reliability. Key features include direct phase-angle detection and frequency restoration capabilities, essential for managing asymmetrical power grids and dynamic load changes. The efficacy of Control-Sync is demonstrated through rigorous testing with grid emulators and multi-phase inverters, confirming its potential to improve microgrid reliability and efficiency. This study offers a scalable solution to enhance inverter adaptability in various grid conditions, fostering a more resilient energy infrastructure.

Title: Integrating Cascade Pumped Micro-Hydro Storage: A Sustainable Approach to Energy and Water Management
Authors: Oraib Dawaghreh, Sharaf K. Magableh, Xuesong Wang, Mohammad Adnan Magableh, Caisheng Wang
Abstract: As traditional large hydropower has been extensively exploited, micro-hydro systems have caught research increasing interest. New engineering challenges arise in developing micro-hydro systems in areas with significant elevation but prohibitive horizontal distances between primary reservoirs. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a cascade-pumped micro-hydro storage (CPMHS) system that leverages intermediate reservoirs to bridge long horizontal distances, enabling efficient energy transfer and storage. The methodology utilizes naturally occurring lakes with substantial head heights but limited feasibility for direct pumped storage due to horizontal separations. Integrating smaller, strategically placed intermediate reservoirs maximizes energy capture along the cascading path, making pumped storage viable in geographically constrained locations. The proposed system will enhance energy generation potential and provide additional benefits for water management. Using geographical data and a detailed case study focused on Mountain Lake and surrounding lakes, this paper demonstrates the energy efficiency and viability of cascade-based micro-hydro storage. A practical methodology for implementing CPMHS systems is proposed and validated by case studies. An optimization framework is developed for efficient energy capture in regions with challenging topography.

Title: Linear Precoding Design for OTFS Systems in Time/Frequency Selective Fading Channels
Authors: Yao Ge, Lingsheng Meng, David González G., Miaowen Wen, Yong Liang Guan, Pingzhi Fan
Abstract: Even orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) has been shown as a promising modulation scheme for high mobility doubly-selective fading channels, its attainability of full diversity order in either time or frequency selective fading channels has not been clarified. By performing pairwise error probability (PEP) analysis, we observe that the original OTFS system can not always guarantee full exploitation of the embedded diversity in either time or frequency selective fading channels. To address this issue and further improve system performance, this work proposes linear precoding solutions based on algebraic number theory for OTFS systems over time and frequency selective fading channels, respectively. The proposed linear precoded OTFS systems can guarantee the maximal diversity and potential coding gains in time/frequency selective fading channels without any transmission rate loss and do not require the channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter. Simulation results are finally provided to illustrate the superiority of our proposed precoded OTFS over both the original unprecoded and the existing phase rotation OTFS systems in time/frequency selective fading channels.

Title: Multipath Component-Aided Signal Processing for Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems
Authors: Haotian Liu, Zhiqing Wei, Xiyang Wang, Yangyang Niu, Yixin Zhang, Huici Wu, Zhiyong Feng
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a pivotal enabling technology for sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication system. The ISAC research in dense urban areas has been plaguing by severe multipath interference, propelling the thorough research of ISAC multipath interference elimination. However, transforming the multipath component (MPC) from enemy into friend is a viable and mutually beneficial option. In this paper, we preliminarily explore the MPC-aided ISAC signal processing and apply a space-time code to improve the ISAC performance. Specifically, we propose a symbol-level fusion for MPC-aided localization (SFMC) scheme to achieve robust and high-accuracy localization, and apply a Khatri-Rao space-time (KRST) code to improve the communication and sensing performance in rich multipath environment. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SFMC scheme has more robust localization performance with higher accuracy, compared with the existing state-of-the-art schemes. The proposed SFMC would benefit highly reliable communication and sub-meter level localization in rich multipath scenarios.

Title: Quantum-MUSIC: Multiple Signal Classification for Quantum Wireless Sensing
Authors: Hanvit Kim, Hyunwoo Park, Sunwoo Kim
Abstract: This paper proposes a Quantum-MUSIC, the first multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm for quantum wireless sensing of multi-user. Since an atomic receiver for quantum wireless sensing can only measure the magnitude of a received signal, sensing performance degradation of traditional antenna-based signal processing algorithms is inevitable. To overcome this limitation, the proposed algorithm recovers the channel information and incorporates the traditional MUSIC algorithm, enabling the sensing of multi-user with magnitude-only measurement. Simulation results showed that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing MUSIC algorithm, validating the superior potential of quantum wireless sensing.

Title: Precoder Implementation and Optimization in 5G NR Massive MIMO Radio
Authors: Kalyani Bhukya, Shahid Aamir Sheikh, Radha Krishna Ganti
Abstract: The evolution of 5G New Radio (NR) has brought significant improvements in signal strength and service quality for users. By integrating Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems into communications, multiple data streams can be transmitted simultaneously across multiple antennas. Additionally, the incorporation of precoding in MIMO systems enables enhanced data rates and spectral efficiency. In wireless networks, precoders are used to steer high-gain beams intended for specific users. This paper focuses on the implementation of 16, 32, and 64 channel linear precoders in the Remote Radio Head (RRH) of the indigenously developed 5G testbed at IIT Madras. These precoders include a memory module to store channel matrices and a multiplier module to perform matrix multiplications between the channel matrices and user data within a slot duration of 500 microseconds. The system demonstrates DSP utilization levels of 9.75%, 19.5%, and 39% for (16 x 8), (32 x 8), and (64 x 8) antenna-layer configurations, respectively, while maintaining Block RAM (BRAM) usage within 2.28%, 3.91%, and 7.16%. Additionally, a throughput of 1.2 Gbps with four active layers highlights the system's optimized performance under hardware constraints.

Title: STARFormer: A Novel Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Reorganization Transformer of FMRI for Brain Disorder Diagnosis
Authors: Wenhao Dong, Yueyang Li, Weiming Zeng, Lei Chen, Hongjie Yan, Wai Ting Siok, Nizhuan Wang
Abstract: Many existing methods that use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) classify brain disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), often overlook the integration of spatial and temporal dependencies of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which may lead to inaccurate or imprecise classification results. To solve this problem, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Aggregation eorganization ransformer (STARFormer) that effectively captures both spatial and temporal features of BOLD signals by incorporating three key modules. The region of interest (ROI) spatial structure analysis module uses eigenvector centrality (EC) to reorganize brain regions based on effective connectivity, highlighting critical spatial relationships relevant to the brain disorder. The temporal feature reorganization module systematically segments the time series into equal-dimensional window tokens and captures multiscale features through variable window and cross-window attention. The spatio-temporal feature fusion module employs a parallel transformer architecture with dedicated temporal and spatial branches to extract integrated features. The proposed STARFormer has been rigorously evaluated on two publicly available datasets for the classification of ASD and ADHD. The experimental results confirm that the STARFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, providing a more accurate and reliable tool for the diagnosis of brain disorders and biomedical research. The codes will be available at: this https URL.

Title: Outlier-Robust Linear System Identification Under Heavy-tailed Noise
Authors: Vinay Kanakeri, Aritra Mitra
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the state transition matrix of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system, given access to multiple independent trajectories sampled from the system. Several recent papers have conducted a non-asymptotic analysis of this problem, relying crucially on the assumption that the process noise is either Gaussian or sub-Gaussian, i.e., "light-tailed". In sharp contrast, we work under a significantly weaker noise model, assuming nothing more than the existence of the fourth moment of the noise distribution. For this setting, we provide the first set of results demonstrating that one can obtain sample-complexity bounds for linear system identification that are nearly of the same order as under sub-Gaussian noise. To achieve such results, we develop a novel robust system identification algorithm that relies on constructing multiple weakly-concentrated estimators, and then boosting their performance using suitable tools from high-dimensional robust statistics. Interestingly, our analysis reveals how the kurtosis of the noise distribution, a measure of heavy-tailedness, affects the number of trajectories needed to achieve desired estimation error bounds. Finally, we show that our algorithm and analysis technique can be easily extended to account for scenarios where an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt a small fraction of the collected trajectory data. Our work takes the first steps towards building a robust statistical learning theory for control under non-ideal assumptions on the data-generating process.

Title: SLoG-Net: Algorithm Unrolling for Source Localization on Graphs
Authors: Chang Ye, Gonzalo Mateos
Abstract: We present a novel model-based deep learning solution for the inverse problem of localizing sources of network diffusion. Starting from first graph signal processing (GSP) principles, we show that the problem reduces to joint (blind) estimation of the forward diffusion filter and a sparse input signal that encodes the source locations. Despite the bilinear nature of the observations in said blind deconvolution task, by requiring invertibility of the diffusion filter we are able to formulate a convex optimization problem and solve it using the alternating-direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We then unroll and truncate the novel ADMM iterations to arrive at a parameterized neural network architecture for Source Localization on Graphs (SLoG-Net), that we train in an end-to-end fashion using labeled data. This supervised learning approach offers several advantages such as interpretability, parameter efficiency, and controllable complexity during inference. Our reproducible numerical experiments corroborate that SLoG-Net exhibits performance on par with the iterative ADMM baseline, but with markedly faster inference times and without needing to manually tune step-size or penalty parameters. Overall, our approach combines the best of both worlds by incorporating the inductive biases of a GSP model-based solution within a data-driven, trainable deep learning architecture for blind deconvolution of graph signals.

Title: A Complex Frequency-Based Control for Inverter-Based Resources
Authors: R. Bernal, F. Milano
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel control for Inverter-based Resources (IBRs) based on the Complex Frequency (CF) concept. The controller's objective is to maintain a constant CF of the voltage at the terminals of the IBR by adjusting its current reference. This current is imposed based on the well-known power flow equation, the dynamics of which are calculated through the estimation of the CF of the voltages of the adjacent buses. Performance is evaluated by analyzing local variations in frequency and magnitude of the voltage, as well as the response of the system's Center of Inertia (CoI) frequency, and then compared with conventional frequency droop, PI voltage controllers and virtual inertia. The case study utilizes the WSCC 9-bus system and a 1479-bus model of the Irish transmission grid and considers various contingencies and sensitivities such as the impact of limiters, delays, noise, R/X ratio, and EMT dynamics. Results show that the proposed scheme consistently outperforms the conventional controllers, leading to significant improvements in the overall dynamic response of the system.

Title: Jointly optimal array geometries and waveforms in active sensing: New insights into array design via the Cram\'er-Rao bound
Authors: Ids van der Werf, Robin Rajamäki, Geert Leus
Abstract: This paper investigates jointly optimal array geometry and waveform designs for active sensing. Specifically, we focus on minimizing the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRB) of the angle of a single target in white Gaussian noise. We first find that several array-waveform pairs can yield the same CRB by virtue of sequences with equal sums of squares, i.e., solutions to certain Diophantine equations. Furthermore, we show that under physical aperture and sensor number constraints, the CRB-minimizing receive array geometry is unique, whereas the transmit array can be chosen flexibly. We leverage this freedom to design a novel sparse array geometry that not only minimizes the single-target CRB given an optimal waveform, but also has a nonredundant and contiguous sum co-array, a desirable property when launching independent waveforms, with relevance also to the multi-target case.

Title: Lyapunov-based Resilient Secondary Synchronization Strategy of AC Microgrids Under Exponentially Energy-Unbounded FDI Attacks
Authors: Mohamadamin Rajabinezhad, Nesa Shams, Asad Ali Khan, Omar A. Beg, Shan Zuo
Abstract: This article presents fully distributed Lyapunov-based attack-resilient secondary control strategies for islanded inverter-based AC microgrids, designed to counter a broad spectrum of energy-unbounded False Data Injection (FDI) attacks, including exponential attacks, targeting control input channels. While distributed control improves scalability and reliability, it also increases susceptibility to cyber threats. The proposed strategies, supported by rigorous Lyapunov-based proofs, ensure uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) convergence for frequency regulation, voltage containment, and power sharing, even under severe cyber attacks. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been demonstrated through case studies on a modified IEEE 34-bus system, leveraging simulations and real-time Hardware-in-the-Loop experiments with OPAL-RT.

Title: 12-bit Delta-Sigma ADC operating at a temperature of up to 250C in Standard 0.18 $\mu$m SOI CMOS
Authors: Christian Sbrana, Alessandro Catania, Tommaso Toschi, Sebastiano Strangio, Giuseppe Iannaccone
Abstract: Some applications require electronic systems to operate at extremely high temperature. Extending the operating temperature range of automotive-grade CMOS processes -- through the use of dedicated design techniques -- can provide an important cost-effective advantage. We present a second-order discrete-time delta-sigma analog-to-digital converter operating at a temperature of up to 250 $^\circ$C, well beyond the 175 $^\circ$C qualification temperature of the automotive-grade CMOS process used for its fabrication (XFAB XT018). The analog-to-digital converter incorporates design techniques that are effective in mitigating the adverse effects of the high temperature, such as increased leakage currents and electromigration. We use configurations of dummy transistors for leakage compensation, clock-boosting methods to limit pass-gate cross-talk, and we optimized the circuit architecture to ensure stability and accuracy at high temperature. Comprehensive measurements demonstrate that the analog-to-digital converter achieves a signal-to-noise ratio exceeding 93 dB at 250 $^\circ$C, with an effective number of bits of 12, and a power consumption of only 44~mW. The die area of the converter is only 0.065~mm$^2$ and the area overhead of the high-temperature mitigation circuits is only 13.7%. The Schreier Figure of Merit is 140~dB at the maximum temperature of 250 $^\circ$C, proving the potential of the circuit for reliable operation in challenging applications such as gas and oil extraction and aeronautics.

Title: H-Net: A Multitask Architecture for Simultaneous 3D Force Estimation and Stereo Semantic Segmentation in Intracardiac Catheters
Authors: Pedram Fekri, Mehrdad Zadeh, Javad Dargahi
Abstract: The success rate of catheterization procedures is closely linked to the sensory data provided to the surgeon. Vision-based deep learning models can deliver both tactile and visual information in a sensor-free manner, while also being cost-effective to produce. Given the complexity of these models for devices with limited computational resources, research has focused on force estimation and catheter segmentation separately. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive architecture capable of simultaneously segmenting the catheter from two different angles and estimating the applied forces in 3D. To bridge this gap, this work proposes a novel, lightweight, multi-input, multi-output encoder-decoder-based architecture. It is designed to segment the catheter from two points of view and concurrently measure the applied forces in the x, y, and z directions. This network processes two simultaneous X-Ray images, intended to be fed by a biplane fluoroscopy system, showing a catheter's deflection from different angles. It uses two parallel sub-networks with shared parameters to output two segmentation maps corresponding to the inputs. Additionally, it leverages stereo vision to estimate the applied forces at the catheter's tip in 3D. The architecture features two input channels, two classification heads for segmentation, and a regression head for force estimation through a single end-to-end architecture. The output of all heads was assessed and compared with the literature, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation and force estimation. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time such a model has been proposed

Title: Event-Triggered Observer-Based Fixed-Time Consensus Control for Uncertain Nonlinear Multiagent Systems with Unknown States
Authors: Kewei Zhou, Ziming Wang, Zhihao Chen, Xin Wang
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for achieving fixed-time tracking consensus control in multiagent systems (MASs). Departing from the reliance on traditional controllers, our innovative controller integrates modified tuning and Lyapunov functions to guarantee stability and convergence. Furthermore, we have implemented an event-triggered strategy aimed at reducing the frequency of updates, alongside an output-feedback observer to manage unmeasured states effectively. To address the challenges posed by unknown functions and algebraic-loop problems, we opted for radial basis function neural networks (RBF NNs), chosen for their superior performance. Our methodology successfully mitigates Zeno's behavior and ensures stability within a narrowly defined set. The efficacy of our proposed solution is validated through two illustrative simulation examples.

Title: NeuroSleepNet: A Multi-Head Self-Attention Based Automatic Sleep Scoring Scheme with Spatial and Multi-Scale Temporal Representation Learning
Authors: Muhammad Sudipto Siam Dip, Mohammod Abdul Motin, Chandan Karmakar, Thomas Penzel, Marimuthu Palaniswami
Abstract: Objective: Automatic sleep scoring is crucial for diagnosing sleep disorders. Existing frameworks based on Polysomnography often rely on long sequences of input signals to predict sleep stages, which can introduce complexity. Moreover, there is limited exploration of simplifying representation learning in sleep scoring methods. Methods: In this study, we propose NeuroSleepNet, an automatic sleep scoring method designed to classify the current sleep stage using only the microevents in the current input signal, without the need for past inputs. Our model employs supervised spatial and multi-scale temporal context learning and incorporates a transformer encoder to enhance representation learning. Additionally, NeuroSleepNet is optimized for balanced performance across five sleep stages by introducing a logarithmic scale-based weighting technique as a loss function. Results: NeuroSleepNet achieved similar and comparable performance with current state-of-the-art results.

Title: Advanced Lung Nodule Segmentation and Classification for Early Detection of Lung Cancer using SAM and Transfer Learning
Authors: Asha V, Bhavanishankar K
Abstract: Lung cancer is an extremely lethal disease primarily due to its late-stage diagnosis and significant mortality rate, making it the major cause of cancer-related demises globally. Machine Learning (ML) and Convolution Neural network (CNN) based Deep Learning (DL) techniques are primarily used for precise segmentation and classification of cancerous nodules in the CT (Computed Tomography) or MRI images. This study introduces an innovative approach to lung nodule segmentation by utilizing the Segment Anything Model (SAM) combined with transfer learning techniques. Precise segmentation of lung nodules is crucial for the early detection of lung cancer. The proposed method leverages Bounding Box prompts and a vision transformer model to enhance segmentation performance, achieving high accuracy, Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Intersection over Union (IoU) metrics. The integration of SAM and Transfer Learning significantly improves Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) systems in medical imaging, particularly for lung cancer diagnosis. The findings demonstrate the proposed model effectiveness in precisely segmenting lung nodules from CT scans, underscoring its potential to advance early detection and improve patient care outcomes in lung cancer diagnosis. The results show SAM Model with transfer learning achieving a DSC of 97.08% and an IoU of 95.6%, for segmentation and accuracy of 96.71% for classification indicates that ,its performance is noteworthy compared to existing techniques.

Title: Privacy-Preserving Distributed Defense Framework for DC Microgrids Against Exponentially Unbounded False Data Injection Attacks
Authors: Yi Zhang, Mohamadamin Rajabinezhad, Yichao Wang, Junbo Zhao, Shan Zuo
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel, fully distributed control framework for DC microgrids, enhancing resilience against exponentially unbounded false data injection (EU-FDI) attacks. Our framework features a consensus-based secondary control for each converter, effectively addressing these advanced threats. To further safeguard sensitive operational data, a privacy-preserving mechanism is incorporated into the control design, ensuring that critical information remains secure even under adversarial conditions. Rigorous Lyapunov stability analysis confirms the framework's ability to maintain critical DC microgrid operations like voltage regulation and load sharing under EU-FDI threats. The framework's practicality is validated through hardware-in-the-loop experiments, demonstrating its enhanced resilience and robust privacy protection against the complex challenges posed by quick variant FDI attacks.

Title: Rethink Delay Doppler Channels and Time-Frequency Coding
Authors: Xiang-Gen Xia
Abstract: In this paper, we rethink delay Doppler channels (also called doubly selective channels). We prove that no modulation schemes can compensate a non-trivial Doppler spread well. This means that the current active OTFS (that is the same as VOFDM) cannot compensate a non-trivial Doppler spread. We then discuss some of the existing methods to deal with time-varying channels, in particular time-frequency (TF) coding in an OFDM system. TF coding is equivalent to space-time coding in the math part. We also summarize state of the art on space-time coding that was an active research topic over 10 years ago.

Title: Lightweight G-YOLOv11: Advancing Efficient Fracture Detection in Pediatric Wrist X-rays
Authors: Abdesselam Ferdi
Abstract: Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have greatly improved the interpretation of medical images by radiologists and surgeons. However, current CAD systems for fracture detection in X-ray images primarily rely on large, resource-intensive detectors, which limits their practicality in clinical settings. To address this limitation, we propose a novel lightweight CAD system based on the YOLO detector for fracture detection. This system, named ghost convolution-based YOLOv11 (G-YOLOv11), builds on the latest version of the YOLO detector family and incorporates the ghost convolution operation for feature extraction. The ghost convolution operation generates the same number of feature maps as traditional convolution but requires fewer linear operations, thereby reducing the detector's computational resource requirements. We evaluated the performance of the proposed G-YOLOv11 detector on the GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset, achieving an mAP@0.5 of 0.535 with an inference time of 2.4 ms on an NVIDIA A10 GPU. Compared to the standard YOLOv11l, G-YOLOv11l achieved reductions of 13.6% in mAP@0.5 and 68.7% in size. These results establish a new state-of-the-art benchmark in terms of efficiency, outperforming existing detectors. Code and models are available at this https URL.

Title: Relative Pose Observability Analysis Using Dual Quaternions
Authors: Nicholas B. Andrews, Kristi A. Morgansen
Abstract: Relative pose (position and orientation) estimation is an essential component of many robotics applications. Fiducial markers, such as the AprilTag visual fiducial system, yield a relative pose measurement from a single marker detection and provide a powerful tool for pose estimation. In this paper, we perform a Lie algebraic nonlinear observability analysis on a nonlinear dual quaternion system that is composed of a relative pose measurement model and a relative motion model. We prove that many common dual quaternion expressions yield Jacobian matrices with advantageous block structures and rank properties that are beneficial for analysis. We show that using a dual quaternion representation yields an observability matrix with a simple block triangular structure and satisfies the necessary full rank condition.

Title: Performance-Barrier Event-Triggered PDE Control of Traffic Flow
Authors: Peihan Zhang, Bhathiya Rathnayake, Mamadou Diagne, Miroslav Krstic
Abstract: For stabilizing stop-and-go oscillations in traffic flow by actuating a variable speed limit (VSL) at a downstream boundary of a freeway segment, we introduce event-triggered PDE backstepping designs employing the recent concept of performance-barrier event-triggered control (P-ETC). Our design is for linearized hyperbolic Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) PDEs governing traffic velocity and density. Compared to continuous feedback, ETC provides a piecewise-constant VSL commands-more likely to be obeyed by human drivers. Unlike the existing regular ETC (R-ETC), which enforces conservatively a strict decrease of a Lyapunov function, our performance-barrier (P-ETC) approach permits an increase, as long as the Lyapunov function remains below a performance barrier, resulting in fewer control updates than R-ETC. To relieve VSL from continuously monitoring the triggering function, we also develop periodic event-triggered (PETC) and self-triggered (STC) versions of both R-ETC and P-ETC. These are referred to as R/P-PETC and R/P-STC, respectively, and we show that they both guarantee Zeno-free behavior and exponential convergence in the spatial $L^2$ norm. With comparative simulations, we illustrate the benefits of the performance-barrier designs through traffic metrics (driver comfort, safety, travel time, fuel consumption). The proposed algorithms reduce discomfort nearly in half relative to driver behavior without VSL, while tripling the driver safety, measured by the average dwell time, relative to the R-ETC frequent-switching VSL schedule.

Title: Smooth Reference Command Generation and Control for Transition Flight of VTOL Aircraft Using Time-Varying Optimization
Authors: Jinrae Kim, John L. Bullock, Sheng Cheng, Naira Hovakimyan
Abstract: Vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft pose a challenge in generating reference commands during transition flight. While sparsity between hover and cruise flight modes can be promoted for effective transitions by formulating $\ell_{1}$-norm minimization problems, solving these problems offline pointwise in time can lead to non-smooth reference commands, resulting in abrupt transitions. This study addresses this limitation by proposing a time-varying optimization method that explicitly considers time dependence. By leveraging a prediction-correction interior-point time-varying optimization framework, the proposed method solves an ordinary differential equation to update reference commands continuously over time, enabling smooth reference command generation in real time. Numerical simulations with a two-dimensional Lift+Cruise vehicle validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating its ability to generate smooth reference commands online.

Title: HCMA-UNet: A Hybrid CNN-Mamba UNet with Inter-Slice Self-Attention for Efficient Breast Cancer Segmentation
Authors: Haoxuan Li, Wei song, Peiwu Qin, Xi Yuan, Zhenglin Chen
Abstract: Breast cancer lesion segmentation in DCE-MRI remains challenging due to heterogeneous tumor morphology and indistinct boundaries. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel hybrid segmentation network, HCMA-UNet, for lesion segmentation of breast cancer. Our network consists of a lightweight CNN backbone and a Multi-view Inter-Slice Self-Attention Mamba (MISM) module. The MISM module integrates Visual State Space Block (VSSB) and Inter-Slice Self-Attention (ISSA) mechanism, effectively reducing parameters through Asymmetric Split Channel (ASC) strategy to achieve efficient tri-directional feature extraction. Our lightweight model achieves superior performance with 2.87M parameters and 126.44 GFLOPs. A Feature-guided Region-aware loss function (FRLoss) is proposed to enhance segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments on one private and two public DCE-MRI breast cancer datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining computational efficiency. FRLoss also exhibits good cross-architecture generalization capabilities. The source code and dataset is available on this link.

Title: VoiceRestore: Flow-Matching Transformers for Speech Recording Quality Restoration
Authors: Stanislav Kirdey
Abstract: We present VoiceRestore, a novel approach to restoring the quality of speech recordings using flow-matching Transformers trained in a self-supervised manner on synthetic data. Our method tackles a wide range of degradations frequently found in both short and long-form speech recordings, including background noise, reverberation, compression artifacts, and bandwidth limitations - all within a single, unified model. Leveraging conditional flow matching and classifier free guidance, the model learns to map degraded speech to high quality recordings without requiring paired clean and degraded datasets. We describe the training process, the conditional flow matching framework, and the model's architecture. We also demonstrate the model's generalization to real-world speech restoration tasks, including both short utterances and extended monologues or dialogues. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that our approach provides a flexible and effective solution for enhancing the quality of speech recordings across varying lengths and degradation types.

Title: Automatic Text Pronunciation Correlation Generation and Application for Contextual Biasing
Authors: Gaofeng Cheng, Haitian Lu, Chengxu Yang, Xuyang Wang, Ta Li, Yonghong Yan
Abstract: Effectively distinguishing the pronunciation correlations between different written texts is a significant issue in linguistic acoustics. Traditionally, such pronunciation correlations are obtained through manually designed pronunciation lexicons. In this paper, we propose a data-driven method to automatically acquire these pronunciation correlations, called automatic text pronunciation correlation (ATPC). The supervision required for this method is consistent with the supervision needed for training end-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E-ASR) systems, i.e., speech and corresponding text annotations. First, the iteratively-trained timestamp estimator (ITSE) algorithm is employed to align the speech with their corresponding annotated text symbols. Then, a speech encoder is used to convert the speech into speech embeddings. Finally, we compare the speech embeddings distances of different text symbols to obtain ATPC. Experimental results on Mandarin show that ATPC enhances E2E-ASR performance in contextual biasing and holds promise for dialects or languages lacking artificial pronunciation lexicons.

Title: SLIDE: Integrating Speech Language Model with LLM for Spontaneous Spoken Dialogue Generation
Authors: Haitian Lu, Gaofeng Cheng, Liuping Luo, Leying Zhang, Yanmin Qian, Pengyuan Zhang
Abstract: Recently, ``textless" speech language models (SLMs) based on speech units have made huge progress in generating naturalistic speech, including non-verbal vocalizations. However, the generated speech samples often lack semantic coherence. In this paper, we propose SLM and LLM Integration for spontaneous spoken Dialogue gEneration (SLIDE). Specifically, we first utilize an LLM to generate the textual content of spoken dialogue. Next, we convert the textual dialogues into phoneme sequences and use a two-tower transformer-based duration predictor to predict the duration of each phoneme. Finally, an SLM conditioned on the spoken phoneme sequences is used to vocalize the textual dialogue. Experimental results on the Fisher dataset demonstrate that our system can generate naturalistic spoken dialogue while maintaining high semantic coherence.

Authors: Hashim A. Hashim
Abstract: Avionics systems of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) or drone are the critical electronic components found onboard that regulate, navigate, and control UAV travel while ensuring public safety. Contemporary UAV avionics work together to facilitate success of UAV missions by enabling stable communication, secure identification protocols, novel energy solutions, multi-sensor accurate perception and autonomous navigation, precise path planning, that guarantees collision avoidance, reliable trajectory control, and efficient data transfer within the UAV system. Moreover, special consideration must be given to electronic warfare threats prevention, detection, and mitigation, and the regulatory framework associated with UAV operations. This review presents the role and taxonomy of each UAV avionics system while covering shortcomings and benefits of available alternatives within each system. UAV communication systems, antennas, and location communication tracking are surveyed. Identification systems that respond to air-to-air or air-to-ground interrogating signals are presented. UAV classical and more innovative power sources are discussed. The rapid development of perception systems improves UAV autonomous navigation and control capabilities. The paper reviews common perception systems, navigation techniques, path planning approaches, obstacle avoidance methods, and tracking control. Modern electronic warfare uses advanced techniques and has to be counteracted by equally advanced methods to keep the public safe. Consequently, this work presents a detailed overview of common electronic warfare threats and state-of-the-art countermeasures and defensive aids. UAV safety occurrences are analyzed in the context of national regulatory framework and the certification process. Databus communication and standards for UAVs are reviewed as they enable efficient and fast real-time data transfer.

Title: Observer-Based Data-Driven Consensus Control for Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems against DoS and FDI attacks
Authors: Yi Zhang, Bin Lei, Mohamadamin Rajabinezhad, Caiwen Ding, Shan Zuo
Abstract: Existing data-driven control methods generally do not address False Data Injection (FDI) and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks simultaneously. This letter introduces a distributed data-driven attack-resilient consensus problem under both FDI and DoS attacks and proposes a data-driven consensus control framework, consisting of a group of comprehensive attack-resilient observers. The proposed group of observers is designed to estimate FDI attacks, external disturbances, and lumped disturbances, combined with a DoS attack compensation mechanism. A rigorous stability analysis of the approach is provided to ensure the boundedness of the distributed neighborhood estimation consensus error. The effectiveness of the approach is validated through numerical examples involving both leaderless consensus and leader-follower consensus, demonstrating significantly improved resilient performance compared to existing data-driven control approaches.

Title: A Novel Approach using CapsNet and Deep Belief Network for Detection and Identification of Oral Leukopenia
Authors: Hirthik Mathesh GV, Kavin Chakravarthy M, Sentil Pandi S
Abstract: Oral cancer constitutes a significant global health concern, resulting in 277,484 fatalities in 2023, with the highest prevalence observed in low- and middle-income nations. Facilitating automation in the detection of possibly malignant and malignant lesions in the oral cavity could result in cost-effective and early disease diagnosis. Establishing an extensive repository of meticulously annotated oral lesions is essential. In this research photos are being collected from global clinical experts, who have been equipped with an annotation tool to generate comprehensive labelling. This research presents a novel approach for integrating bounding box annotations from various doctors. Additionally, Deep Belief Network combined with CAPSNET is employed to develop automated systems that extracted intricate patterns to address this challenging problem. This study evaluated two deep learning-based computer vision methodologies for the automated detection and classification of oral lesions to facilitate the early detection of oral cancer: image classification utilizing CAPSNET. Image classification attained an F1 score of 94.23% for detecting photos with lesions 93.46% for identifying images necessitating referral. Object detection attained an F1 score of 89.34% for identifying lesions for referral. Subsequent performances are documented about classification based on the sort of referral decision. Our preliminary findings indicate that deep learning possesses the capability to address this complex problem.

Title: Enhancing Early Diabetic Retinopathy Detection through Synthetic DR1 Image Generation: A StyleGAN3 Approach
Authors: Sagarnil Das, Pradeep Walia
Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of preventable blindness. Early detection at the DR1 stage is critical but is hindered by a scarcity of high-quality fundus images. This study uses StyleGAN3 to generate synthetic DR1 images characterized by microaneurysms with high fidelity and diversity. The aim is to address data scarcity and enhance the performance of supervised classifiers. A dataset of 2,602 DR1 images was used to train the model, followed by a comprehensive evaluation using quantitative metrics, including Frechet Inception Distance (FID), Kernel Inception Distance (KID), and Equivariance with respect to translation (EQ-T) and rotation (EQ-R). Qualitative assessments included Human Turing tests, where trained ophthalmologists evaluated the realism of synthetic images. Spectral analysis further validated image quality. The model achieved a final FID score of 17.29, outperforming the mean FID of 21.18 (95 percent confidence interval - 20.83 to 21.56) derived from bootstrap resampling. Human Turing tests demonstrated the model's ability to produce highly realistic images, though minor artifacts near the borders were noted. These findings suggest that StyleGAN3-generated synthetic DR1 images hold significant promise for augmenting training datasets, enabling more accurate early detection of Diabetic Retinopathy. This methodology highlights the potential of synthetic data in advancing medical imaging and AI-driven diagnostics.

Title: Defense Strategies for Autonomous Multi-agent Systems: Ensuring Safety and Resilience Under Exponentially Unbounded FDI Attacks
Authors: Yichao Wang, Mohamadamin Rajabinezhad, Rui Liu, Shan Zuo
Abstract: False data injection (FDI) attacks pose a significant threat to autonomous multi-agent systems (MASs). While resilient control strategies address FDI attacks, they typically have strict assumptions on the attack signals and overlook safety constraints, such as collision avoidance. In practical applications, leader agents equipped with advanced sensors or weaponry span a safe region to guide heterogeneous follower agents, ensuring coordinated operations while addressing collision avoidance to prevent financial losses and mission failures. This letter addresses these gaps by introducing and studying the safety-aware and attack-resilient (SAAR) control problem under exponentially unbounded FDI (EU-FDI) attacks. Specifically, a novel attack-resilient observer layer (OL) is first designed to defend against EU-FDI attacks on the OL. Then, by solving an optimization problem using the quadratic programming (QP), the safety constraints for collision avoidance are further integrated into the SAAR controller design to prevent collisions among followers. An attack-resilient compensational signal is finally designed to mitigate the adverse effects caused by the EU-FDI attack on control input layer (CIL). Rigorous Lyapunov-based stability analysis certifies the SAAR controller's effectiveness in ensuring both safety and resilience. This study also pioneers a three-dimensional simulation of the SAAR containment control problem for autonomous MASs, demonstrating its applicability in realistic multi-agent scenarios.

Title: Cyber-physical Defense for Heterogeneous Multi-agent Systems Against Exponentially Unbounded Attacks on Signed Digraphs
Authors: Yichao Wang, Mohamadamin Rajabinezhad, Yi Zhang, Shan Zuo
Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are subjected to attacks on both cyber and physical spaces. In reality, the attackers could launch exponentially unbounded false data injection (EU-FDI) attacks, which are more destructive and could lead to the system's collapse or instability. Existing literature generally addresses bounded attack signals and/or bounded-first-order-derivative attack signals, which exposes the CPSs to significant threats. In contrast, this paper proposes a fully-distributed attack-resilient bi-layer defense framework to address the bipartite output containment problem for heterogeneous multi-agent systems on signed digraphs, in the presence of EU-FDI attacks on both cyber-physical layer (CPL) and observer layer (OL). First, we design attack-resilient dynamic compensators that utilize data communicated on the OL to estimate the convex combinations of the states and negative states of the leaders. The attack-resilient compensators address the EU-FDI attacks on the OL and guarantee the uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) estimation of the leaders' states. Then, by using the compensators' states, fully-distributed attack-resilient controllers are designed on the CPL to further address the EU-FDI attacks on the actuators. Rigorous mathematical proof based on Lyapunov stability analysis is provided, establishing the theoretical soundness of the proposed bi-layer resilient defense framework, by preserving the UUB consensus and stability against EU-FDI attacks on both CPL and OL. Finally, a comparative case study for heterogeneous multi-agent systems validate the enhanced resilience of the proposed defense strategies.

Title: Scalable Beamforming Design for Multi-RIS-Aided MU-MIMO Systems with Imperfect CSIT
Authors: Mintaek Oh, Jinseok Choi
Abstract: A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising solution for enhancing the capabilities of wireless communications. This paper presents a scalable beamforming design for maximizing the spectral efficiency (SE) of multi-RIS-aided communications through joint optimization of the precoder and RIS phase shifts in multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems under imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). To address key challenges of the joint optimization problem, we first decompose it into two subproblems with deriving a proper lower bound. We then leverage a generalized power iteration (GPI) approach to identify a superior local optimal precoding solution. We further extend this approach to the RIS design using regularization; we set a RIS regularization function to efficiently handle the unitmodulus constraints, and also find the superior local optimal solution for RIS phase shifts under the GPI-based optimization framework. Subsequently, we propose an alternating optimization method. In particular, utilizing the block-diagonal structure of the matrices the GPI method, the proposed algorithm offers multi-RIS scalable beamforming as well as superior SE performance. Simulations validate the proposed method in terms of both the sum SE performance and the scalability.

Title: Confined Orthogonal Matching Pursuit for Sparse Random Combinatorial Matrices
Authors: Xinwei Zhao, Jinming Wen, Hongqi Yang, Xiao Ma
Abstract: Orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) is a commonly used greedy algorithm for recovering sparse signals from compressed measurements. In this paper, we introduce a variant of the OMP algorithm to reduce the complexity of reconstructing a class of $K$-sparse signals $\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ from measurements $\boldsymbol{y} = \boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{x}$, where $\boldsymbol{A} \in \{0,1\}^{m \times n}$ is a sparse random combinatorial matrix with $d~(d \leq m/2)$ ones per column. The proposed algorithm, referred to as the confined OMP algorithm, utilizes the properties of $\boldsymbol{x}$ and $\boldsymbol{A}$ to remove much of the redundancy in the dictionary (also referred to as $\boldsymbol{A}$) and thus fewer column indices of $\boldsymbol{A}$ need to be identified. To this end, we first define a confined set $\Gamma$ with $|\Gamma| \leq n$ and then prove that the support of $\boldsymbol{x}$ is a subset of $\Gamma$ with probability 1 if the distributions of non-zero components of $\boldsymbol{x}$ satisfy a certain condition. During the process of the confined OMP algorithm, the possibly chosen column indices are strictly confined into the confined set $\Gamma$. We further develop lower bounds on the probability of exact recovery of $\boldsymbol{x}$ using OMP algorithm and confined OMP algorithm with $K$ iterations, respectively. The obtained theoretical results of confined OMP algorithm can be used to optimize the column degree $d$ of $\boldsymbol{A}$. Finally, experimental results show that the confined OMP algorithm is more efficient in reconstructing a class of sparse signals compared to the OMP algorithm.

Title: Beamforming Design for Wideband Near-Field Communications With Reconfigurable Refractive Surfaces
Authors: Zicheng Lin, Shuhao Zeng, Aryan Kaushik, Hongliang Zhang
Abstract: To meet the growing demand for high data rates, cellular systems are expected to evolve towards higher carrier frequencies and larger antenna arrays, but conventional phased arrays face challenges in supporting such a prospection due to their excessive power consumption induced by numerous phase shifters required. Reconfigurable Refractive Surface (RRS) is an energy efficient solution to address this issue without relying on phase shifters. However, the increased radiation aperture size extends the range of the Fresnel region, leading the users to lie in the near-field zone. Moreover, given the wideband communications in higher frequency bands, we cannot ignore the frequency selectivity of the RRS. These two effects collectively exacerbate the beam-split issue, where different frequency components fail to converge on the user simultaneously, and finally result in a degradation of the data rate. In this paper, we investigate an RRS-based wideband near-field multi-user communication system. Unlike most existing studies on wideband communications, which consider the beam-split effect only with the near-field condition, we study the beam-split effect under the influence of both the near-field condition and the frequency selectivity of the RRS. To mitigate the beam-split effect, we propose a Delayed-RRS structure, based on which a beamforming scheme is proposed to optimize the user's data rate. Through theoretical analysis and simulation results, we analyze the influence of the RRS's frequency selectivity, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed beamforming scheme, and reveal the importance of jointly considering the near-field condition and the frequency selectivity of RRS.

Title: Power-Efficient Optimization for Coexisting Semantic and Bit-Based Users in NOMA Networks
Authors: Ximing Xie, Fang Fang, Lan Zhang, Xianbin Wang
Abstract: Semantic communication focuses on transmitting the meaning of data, aiming for efficient, relevant communication, while non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) enhances spectral efficiency by allowing multiple users to share the same spectrum. Integrating semantic users into a NOMA network with bit-based users improves both transmission and spectrum efficiency. However, the performance metric for semantic communication differs significantly from that of traditional communication, posing challenges in simultaneously meeting individual user demands and minimizing transmission power, especially in scenarios with coexisting semantic and bit-based users. Furthermore, the different hardware architectures of semantic and bit-based users complicate the implementation of successive interference cancellation (SIC). To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a clustered framework to mitigate the complexity of SIC and two multiple access (MA) schemes, e.g., pure cluster-based NOMA (P-CNOMA) and hybrid cluster-based NOMA (H-CNOMA), to minimize the total transmission power. The P-CNOMA scheme can achieve the minimum transmission power, but may not satisfy the high quality of service (QoS) requirement. In contrast, H-CNOMA addresses these issues with a slight increase in power and a reduced semantic rate. These two schemes complement each other, enabling an adaptive MA selection mechanism that adapts to specific network conditions and user requirements.

Title: Fundamental MMSE-Rate Performance Limits of Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems
Authors: Zijie Wang, Xudong Wang
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) demonstrates promise for 6G networks; yet its performance limits, which require addressing functional Pareto stochastic optimizations, remain underexplored. Existing works either overlook the randomness of ISAC signals or approximate ISAC limits from sensing and communication (SAC) optimum-achieving strategies, leading to loose bounds. In this paper, ISAC limits are investigated by considering a random ISAC signal designated to simultaneously estimate the sensing channel and convey information over the communication channel, adopting the modified minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE), a metric defined in accordance with the randomness of ISAC signals, and the Shannon rate as respective SAC metrics. First, conditions for optimal channel input and output distributions on the MMSE-Rate limit are derived employing variational approaches, leading to high-dimensional convolutional equations. Second, leveraging variational conditions, a Blahut-Arimoto-type algorithm is proposed to numerically determine optimal distributions and SAC performance, with its convergence to the limit proven. Third, closed-form SAC-optimal waveforms are derived, characterized by power allocation according to channel statistics/realization and waveform selection; existing methods to establish looser ISAC bounds are rectified. Finally, a compound signaling strategy is introduced for coincided SAC channels, which employs sequential SAC-optimal waveforms for channel estimation and data transmission, showcasing significant rate improvements over non-coherent "capacity". This study systematically investigates ISAC performance limits from joint estimation- and information-theoretic perspectives, highlighting key SAC tradeoffs and potential ISAC design benefits. The methodology readily extends to various metrics, such as estimation rate and the Cramer-Rao Bound.

Title: Time Difference of Arrival Source Localization: Exact Linear Solutions for the General 3D Problem
Authors: Niraj K. Inamdar
Abstract: The time difference of arrival (TDOA) problem admits exact, purely algebraic solutions for the situation in which there are 4 and 5 sensors and a single source whose position is to be determined in 3 dimensions. The solutions are exact in the sense that there is no least squares operation (i.e., projection) involved in the solution. The solutions involve no linearization or iteration, and are algebraically transparent via vector algebra in Cartesian coordinates. The solution with 5 sensors requires no resolution of sign ambiguities; the solution with 4 sensors requires resolution of one sign ambiguity. Solutions are effected using only TDOA and not, e.g., frequency difference of arrival (FDOA) or angle of arrival (AOA). We first present the 5-sensor solution and then follow with the 4-sensor scenario. Numerical experiments are presented showing the performance of the calculations in the case of no noise, before closing with conclusions. Performance of the calculations is exact within numerical error, and in the small fraction of cases in which source localization does not occur, it is driven by misidentification in resolution of sign ambiguity without priors. We therefore believe the calculations have substantial practical utility for their speed and exactness.

Title: Learning-Based Stable Optimal Guidance for Spacecraft Close-Proximity Operations
Authors: Kun Wang, Roberto Armellin, Adam Evans, Harry Holt, Zheng Chen
Abstract: Machine learning techniques have demonstrated their effectiveness in achieving autonomy and optimality for nonlinear and high-dimensional dynamical systems. However, traditional black-box machine learning methods often lack formal stability guarantees, which are critical for safety-sensitive aerospace applications. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework that combines control Lyapunov functions with supervised learning to provide certifiably stable, time- and fuel-optimal guidance for rendezvous maneuvers governed by Clohessy-Wiltshire dynamics. The framework is easily extensible to nonlinear control-affine systems. A novel neural candidate Lyapunov function is developed to ensure positive definiteness. Subsequently, a control policy is defined, in which the thrust direction vector minimizes the Lyapunov function's time derivative, and the thrust throttle is determined using minimal required throttle. This approach ensures that all loss terms related to the control Lyapunov function are either naturally satisfied or replaced by the derived control policy. To jointly supervise the Lyapunov function and the control policy, a simple loss function is introduced, leveraging optimal state-control pairs obtained by a polynomial maps based method. Consequently, the trained neural network not only certifies the Lyapunov function but also generates a near-optimal guidance policy, even for the bang-bang fuel-optimal problem. Extensive numerical simulations are presented to validate the proposed method.

Title: Disambiguation of Chinese Polyphones in an End-to-End Framework with Semantic Features Extracted by Pre-trained BERT
Authors: Dongyang Dai, Zhiyong Wu, Shiyin Kang, Xixin Wu, Jia Jia, Dan Su, Dong Yu, Helen Meng
Abstract: Grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion serves as an essential component in Chinese Mandarin text-to-speech (TTS) system, where polyphone disambiguation is the core issue. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework to predict the pronunciation of a polyphonic character, which accepts sentence containing polyphonic character as input in the form of Chinese character sequence without the necessity of any preprocessing. The proposed method consists of a pre-trained bidirectional encoder representations from Transformers (BERT) model and a neural network (NN) based classifier. The pre-trained BERT model extracts semantic features from a raw Chinese character sequence and the NN based classifier predicts the polyphonic character's pronunciation according to BERT output. In out experiments, we implemented three classifiers, a fully-connected network based classifier, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network based classifier and a Transformer block based classifier. The experimental results compared with the baseline approach based on LSTM demonstrate that, the pre-trained model extracts effective semantic features, which greatly enhances the performance of polyphone disambiguation. In addition, we also explored the impact of contextual information on polyphone disambiguation.

Title: learning discriminative features from spectrograms using center loss for speech emotion recognition
Authors: Dongyang Dai, Zhiyong Wu, Runnan Li, Xixin Wu, Jia Jia, Helen Meng
Abstract: Identifying the emotional state from speech is essential for the natural interaction of the machine with the speaker. However, extracting effective features for emotion recognition is difficult, as emotions are ambiguous. We propose a novel approach to learn discriminative features from variable length spectrograms for emotion recognition by cooperating softmax cross-entropy loss and center loss together. The softmax cross-entropy loss enables features from different emotion categories separable, and center loss efficiently pulls the features belonging to the same emotion category to their center. By combining the two losses together, the discriminative power will be highly enhanced, which leads to network learning more effective features for emotion recognition. As demonstrated by the experimental results, after introducing center loss, both the unweighted accuracy and weighted accuracy are improved by over 3\% on Mel-spectrogram input, and more than 4\% on Short Time Fourier Transform spectrogram input.

Abstract: The battery performance and lifespan of electric vehicles (EVs) degrade significantly in cold climates, requiring a considerable amount of energy to heat up the EV batteries. This paper proposes a novel technology, namely temperature-controlled smart charging, to coordinate the heating/charging power and reduce the total energy use of a solar-powered EV charging station. Instead of fixing the battery temperature setpoints, we analyze the thermal dynamics and inertia of EV batteries, and decide the optimal timing and proper amount of energy allocated for heating. In addition, a temperature-sensitive charging model is formulated with consideration of dynamic charging rates as well as battery health. We further tailor acceleration algorithms for large-scale EV charging, including the reduced-order dual decomposition and vehicle rescheduling. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed temperature-controlled smart charging is superior in capturing the flexibility value of EV batteries and making full use of the rooftop solar energy. The proposed model typically achieves a 12.5--18.4% reduction in the charging cost and a 0.4--6.8% drop in the overhead energy use for heating.

Title: Ultrasound Lung Aeration Map via Physics-Aware Neural Operators
Authors: Jiayun Wang, Oleksii Ostras, Masashi Sode, Bahareh Tolooshams, Zongyi Li, Kamyar Azizzadenesheli, Gianmarco Pinton, Anima Anandkumar
Abstract: Lung ultrasound is a growing modality in clinics for diagnosing and monitoring acute and chronic lung diseases due to its low cost and accessibility. Lung ultrasound works by emitting diagnostic pulses, receiving pressure waves and converting them into radio frequency (RF) data, which are then processed into B-mode images with beamformers for radiologists to interpret. However, unlike conventional ultrasound for soft tissue anatomical imaging, lung ultrasound interpretation is complicated by complex reverberations from the pleural interface caused by the inability of ultrasound to penetrate air. The indirect B-mode images make interpretation highly dependent on reader expertise, requiring years of training, which limits its widespread use despite its potential for high accuracy in skilled hands. To address these challenges and democratize ultrasound lung imaging as a reliable diagnostic tool, we propose LUNA, an AI model that directly reconstructs lung aeration maps from RF data, bypassing the need for traditional beamformers and indirect interpretation of B-mode images. LUNA uses a Fourier neural operator, which processes RF data efficiently in Fourier space, enabling accurate reconstruction of lung aeration maps. LUNA offers a quantitative, reader-independent alternative to traditional semi-quantitative lung ultrasound scoring methods. The development of LUNA involves synthetic and real data: We simulate synthetic data with an experimentally validated approach and scan ex vivo swine lungs as real data. Trained on abundant simulated data and fine-tuned with a small amount of real-world data, LUNA achieves robust performance, demonstrated by an aeration estimation error of 9% in ex-vivo lung scans. We demonstrate the potential of reconstructing lung aeration maps from RF data, providing a foundation for improving lung ultrasound reproducibility and diagnostic utility.

Title: Automated monitoring of bee colony movement in the hive during winter season
Authors: Rostyslav Koroliuk, Vyacheslav Nykytyuk, Vitaliy Tymoshchuk, Veronika Soyka, Dmytro Tymoshchuk
Abstract: In this study, we have experimentally modelled the movement of a bee colony in a hive during the winter season and developed a monitoring system that allows tracking the movement of the bee colony and honey consumption. The monitoring system consists of four load cells connected to the RP2040 controller based on the Raspberry Pi Pico board, from which data is transmitted via the MQTT protocol to the Raspberry Pi 5 microcomputer via a Wi-Fi network. The processed data from the Raspberry Pi 5 is recorded in a MySQL database. The algorithm for finding the location of the bee colony in the hive works correctly, the trajectory of movement based on the data from the sensors repeats the physical movement in the experiment, which is an imitation of the movement of the bee colony in real conditions. The proposed monitoring system provides continuous observation of the bee colony without adversely affecting its natural activities and can be integrated with various wireless data networks. This is a promising tool for improving the efficiency of beekeeping and maintaining the health of bee colonies.

Title: ROME: Robust Model Ensembling for Semantic Communication Against Semantic Jamming Attacks
Authors: Kequan Zhou, Guangyi Zhang, Yunlong Cai, Qiyu Hu, Guanding Yu
Abstract: Recently, semantic communication (SC) has garnered increasing attention for its efficiency, yet it remains vulnerable to semantic jamming attacks. These attacks entail introducing crafted perturbation signals to legitimate signals over the wireless channel, thereby misleading the receivers' semantic interpretation. This paper investigates the above issue from a practical perspective. Contrasting with previous studies focusing on power-fixed attacks, we extensively consider a more challenging scenario of power-variable attacks by devising an innovative attack model named Adjustable Perturbation Generator (APG), which is capable of generating semantic jamming signals of various power levels. To combat semantic jamming attacks, we propose a novel framework called Robust Model Ensembling (ROME) for secure semantic communication. Specifically, ROME can detect the presence of semantic jamming attacks and their power levels. When high-power jamming attacks are detected, ROME adapts to raise its robustness at the cost of generalization ability, and thus effectively accommodating the attacks. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the robustness of the system, demonstrating its superiority in combating semantic jamming attacks via adaptive robustness. Simulation results show that the proposed ROME approach exhibits significant adaptability and delivers graceful robustness and generalization ability under power-variable semantic jamming attacks.

Title: Can Human Drivers and Connected Autonomous Vehicles Co-exist in Lane-Free Traffic? A Microscopic Simulation Perspective
Authors: Arslan Ali Syed, Majid Rostami-Shahrbabaki, Klaus Bogenberger
Abstract: Recent advancements in connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology have sparked growing research interest in lane-free traffic (LFT). LFT envisions a scenario where all vehicles are CAVs, coordinating their movements without lanes to achieve smoother traffic flow and higher road capacity. This potentially reduces congestion without building new infrastructure. However, the transition phase will likely involve non-connected actors such as human-driven vehicles (HDVs) or independent AVs sharing the roads. This raises the question of how LFT performance is impacted when not all vehicles are CAVs, as these non-connected vehicles may prioritize their own benefits over system-wide improvements. This paper addresses this question through microscopic simulation on a ring road, where CAVs follow the potential lines (PL) controller for LFT, while HDVs adhere to a strip-based car-following model. The PL controller is also modified for safe velocities to prevent collisions. The results reveal that even a small percentage of HDVs can significantly disrupt LFT flow: 5% HDVs can reduce LFT's maximum road capacity by 16%, and a 20% HDVs nearly halves it. The study also develops an adaptive potential (APL) controller that forms APL corridors with modified PLs in the surroundings of HDVs. APL shows a peak traffic flow improvement of 23.6% over the PL controller. The study indicates that a penetration rate of approximately 60% CAVs in LFT is required before significant benefits of LFT start appearing compared to a scenario with all HDVs. These findings open a new research direction on minimizing the adverse effects of non-connected vehicles on LFT.

Title: Data-Driven Yet Formal Policy Synthesis for Stochastic Nonlinear Dynamical Systems
Authors: Mahdi Nazeri, Thom Badings, Sadegh Soudjani, Alessandro Abate
Abstract: The automated synthesis of control policies for stochastic dynamical systems presents significant challenges. A standard approach is to construct a finite-state abstraction of the continuous system, typically represented as a Markov decision process (MDP). However, generating abstractions is challenging when (1) the system's dynamics are nonlinear, and/or (2) we do not have complete knowledge of the dynamics. In this work, we introduce a novel data-driven abstraction technique for nonlinear dynamical systems with additive stochastic noise that addresses both of these issues. As a key step, we use samples of the dynamics to learn the enabled actions and transition probabilities of the abstraction. We represent abstractions as MDPs with intervals of transition probabilities, known as interval MDPs (IMDPs). These abstractions enable the synthesis of control policies for the concrete nonlinear system, with probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantees on the probability of satisfying a specified control objective. Through numerical experiments, we illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach in achieving reliable control under uncertainty.

Title: Sensitivity of Room Impulse Responses in Changing Acoustic Environment
Authors: Karolina Prawda
Abstract: Changes in room acoustics, such as modifications to surface absorption or the insertion of a scattering object, significantly impact measured room impulse responses (RIRs). These changes can affect the performance of systems used in echo cancellation and active acoustics and support tasks such as navigation and object tracking. Recognizing and quantifying such changes is, therefore, critical for advancing technologies based on room acoustics. This study introduces a method for analyzing acoustic environment changes by evaluating the similarity of consecutively recorded RIRs. Short-time coherence is employed to characterize modifications, including changes in wall absorption or the presence of a moving person in the room. A sensitivity rating is further used to quantify the magnitude of these changes. The results clearly differentiate between types of modifications -- atmospheric variation, changes in absorption, and human presence. The methods described provide a novel approach to analyzing and interpreting room acoustics, emphasizing RIR similarity and extracting information from temporal and spectral signal properties.

Title: Movable Antenna-Assisted Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems
Authors: Chengjun Jiang, Chensi Zhang, Chongwen Huang, Jianhua Ge, Dusit Niyato, Chau Yuen
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) enhance flexibility in beamforming gain and interference suppression by adjusting position within certain areas of the transceivers. In this paper, we propose an MA-assisted integrated sensing and communication framework, wherein MAs are deployed for reconfiguring the channel array responses at both the receiver and transmitter of a base station. Then, we develop an optimization framework aimed at maximizing the sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) by jointly optimizing the receive beamforming vector, the transmit beamforming matrix, and the positions of MAs while meeting the minimum SINR requirement for each user. To address this nonconvex problem involving complex coupled variables, we devise an alternating optimization-based algorithm that incorporates techniques including the Charnes-Cooper transform, second-order Taylor expansion, and successive convex approximation (SCA). Specifically, the closed form of the received vector and the optimal transmit matrix can be first obtained in each iteration. Subsequently, the solutions for the positions of the transmit and receive MAs are obtained using the SCA method based on the second-order Taylor expansion. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme has significant advantages over the other baseline schemes. In particular, the proposed scheme has the ability to match the performance of the fixed position antenna scheme while utilizing fewer resources.

Title: Towards Intelligent Antenna Positioning: Leveraging DRL for FAS-Aided ISAC Systems
Authors: Shunxing Yang, Junteng Yao, Jie Tang, Tuo Wu, Maged Elkashlan, Chau Yuen, Merouane Debbah, Hyundong Shin, Matthew Valenti
Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) enable dynamic antenna positioning, offering new opportunities to enhance integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) performance. However, existing studies primarily focus on communication enhancement or single-target sensing, leaving multi-target scenarios underexplored. Additionally, the joint optimization of beamforming and antenna positions poses a highly non-convex problem, with traditional methods becoming impractical as the number of fluid antennas increases. To address these challenges, this letter proposes a block coordinate descent (BCD) framework integrated with a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach for intelligent antenna positioning. By leveraging the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, the proposed framework efficiently balances sensing and communication performance. Simulation results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Title: Privacy Preservation in MIMO-OFDM Localization Systems: A Beamforming Approach
Authors: Yuchen Zhang, Hui Chen, Musa Furkan Keskin, Alireza Pourafzal, Pinjun Zheng, Henk Wymeersch, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri
Abstract: We investigate an uplink MIMO-OFDM localization scenario where a legitimate base station (BS) aims to localize a user equipment (UE) using pilot signals transmitted by the UE, while an unauthorized BS attempts to localize the UE by eavesdropping on these pilots, posing a risk to the UE's location privacy. To enhance legitimate localization performance while protecting the UE's privacy, we formulate an optimization problem regarding the beamformers at the UE, aiming to minimize the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for legitimate localization while constraining the CRB for unauthorized localization above a threshold. A penalty dual decomposition optimization framework is employed to solve the problem, leading to a novel beamforming approach for location privacy preservation. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach and demonstrate its superiority over existing benchmarks.

Title: Smoothing traffic flow through automated vehicle control with optimal parameter selection
Authors: Shian Wang, Jose Acedo Aguilar, Miguel Velez-Reyes
Abstract: Stop-and-go traffic waves are known for reducing the efficiency of transportation systems by increasing traffic oscillations and energy consumption. In this study, we develop an approach to synthesize a class of additive feedback controllers for automated vehicles (AVs) to smooth nonlinear mixed traffic flow, including both AVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs). Unlike recent explicit AV controllers that rely on strict assumptions such as time-varying equilibrium traffic speed, our proposed AV controller requires only local traffic information, such as inter-vehicle spacing and relative speed, which are readily available through AV onboard sensors. Essentially, it allows a controlled AV to track a subtler version of the perturbed speed profile resulting from its preceding vehicle, thereby enabling smoother traffic flow. Additionally, we provide a method for selecting the optimal control parameters to achieve traffic-smoothing effects efficiently. These unique features of the developed AV controller ensure much higher implementability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through simulations of two distinct traffic scenarios with varying levels of oscillation. The results show that AVs using the proposed controller are capable of effectively reducing traffic oscillations and lowering vehicle fuel consumption by up to 46.78\% and 2.74\%, respectively, for a platoon of 10 vehicles. The traffic-smoothing effect of the controller is more pronounced at higher penetration rates of AVs. While the performance of the proposed approach is slightly less superior to that of the most recent additive AV controller, it offers greater implementability and provides an efficient method for selecting optimal control parameters.

Title: ScarNet: A Novel Foundation Model for Automated Myocardial Scar Quantification from LGE in Cardiac MRI
Authors: Neda Tavakoli, Amir Ali Rahsepar, Brandon C. Benefield, Daming Shen, Santiago López-Tapia, Florian Schiffers, Jeffrey J. Goldberger, Christine M. Albert, Edwin Wu, Aggelos K. Katsaggelos, Daniel C. Lee, Daniel Kim
Abstract: Background: Late Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) imaging is the gold standard for assessing myocardial fibrosis and scarring, with left ventricular (LV) LGE extent predicting major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Despite its importance, routine LGE-based LV scar quantification is hindered by labor-intensive manual segmentation and inter-observer variability. Methods: We propose ScarNet, a hybrid model combining a transformer-based encoder from the Medical Segment Anything Model (MedSAM) with a convolution-based U-Net decoder, enhanced by tailored attention blocks. ScarNet was trained on 552 ischemic cardiomyopathy patients with expert segmentations of myocardial and scar boundaries and tested on 184 separate patients. Results: ScarNet achieved robust scar segmentation in 184 test patients, yielding a median Dice score of 0.912 (IQR: 0.863--0.944), significantly outperforming MedSAM (median Dice = 0.046, IQR: 0.043--0.047) and nnU-Net (median Dice = 0.638, IQR: 0.604--0.661). ScarNet demonstrated lower bias (-0.63%) and coefficient of variation (4.3%) compared to MedSAM (bias: -13.31%, CoV: 130.3%) and nnU-Net (bias: -2.46%, CoV: 20.3%). In Monte Carlo simulations with noise perturbations, ScarNet achieved significantly higher scar Dice (0.892 \pm 0.053, CoV = 5.9%) than MedSAM (0.048 \pm 0.112, CoV = 233.3%) and nnU-Net (0.615 \pm 0.537, CoV = 28.7%). Conclusion: ScarNet outperformed MedSAM and nnU-Net in accurately segmenting myocardial and scar boundaries in LGE images. The model exhibited robust performance across diverse image qualities and scar patterns.

Title: ProjectedEx: Enhancing Generation in Explainable AI for Prostate Cancer
Authors: Xuyin Qi, Zeyu Zhang, Aaron Berliano Handoko, Huazhan Zheng, Mingxi Chen, Ta Duc Huy, Vu Minh Hieu Phan, Lei Zhang, Linqi Cheng, Shiyu Jiang, Zhiwei Zhang, Zhibin Liao, Yang Zhao, Minh-Son To
Abstract: Prostate cancer, a growing global health concern, necessitates precise diagnostic tools, with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offering high-resolution soft tissue imaging that significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy. Recent advancements in explainable AI and representation learning have significantly improved prostate cancer diagnosis by enabling automated and precise lesion classification. However, existing explainable AI methods, particularly those based on frameworks like generative adversarial networks (GANs), are predominantly developed for natural image generation, and their application to medical imaging often leads to suboptimal performance due to the unique characteristics and complexity of medical image. To address these challenges, our paper introduces three key contributions. First, we propose ProjectedEx, a generative framework that provides interpretable, multi-attribute explanations, effectively linking medical image features to classifier decisions. Second, we enhance the encoder module by incorporating feature pyramids, which enables multiscale feedback to refine the latent space and improves the quality of generated explanations. Additionally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on both the generator and classifier, demonstrating the clinical relevance and effectiveness of ProjectedEx in enhancing interpretability and supporting the adoption of AI in medical settings.

Title: VoiceVector: Multimodal Enrolment Vectors for Speaker Separation
Authors: Akam Rahimi, Triantafyllos Afouras, Andrew Zisserman
Abstract: We present a transformer-based architecture for voice separation of a target speaker from multiple other speakers and ambient noise. We achieve this by using two separate neural networks: (A) An enrolment network designed to craft speaker-specific embeddings, exploiting various combinations of audio and visual modalities; and (B) A separation network that accepts both the noisy signal and enrolment vectors as inputs, outputting the clean signal of the target speaker. The novelties are: (i) the enrolment vector can be produced from: audio only, audio-visual data (using lip movements) or visual data alone (using lip movements from silent video); and (ii) the flexibility in conditioning the separation on multiple positive and negative enrolment vectors. We compare with previous methods and obtain superior performance.

Title: SECodec: Structural Entropy-based Compressive Speech Representation Codec for Speech Language Models
Authors: Linqin Wang, Yaping Liu, Zhengtao Yu, Shengxiang Gao, Cunli Mao, Yuxin Huang, Wenjun Wang, Ling Dong
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), discrete speech representations have become crucial for integrating speech into LLMs. Existing methods for speech representation discretization rely on a predefined codebook size and Euclidean distance-based quantization. However, 1) the size of codebook is a critical parameter that affects both codec performance and downstream task training efficiency. 2) The Euclidean distance-based quantization may lead to audio distortion when the size of the codebook is controlled within a reasonable range. In fact, in the field of information compression, structural information and entropy guidance are crucial, but previous methods have largely overlooked these factors. Therefore, we address the above issues from an information-theoretic perspective, we present SECodec, a novel speech representation codec based on structural entropy (SE) for building speech language models. Specifically, we first model speech as a graph, clustering the speech features nodes within the graph and extracting the corresponding codebook by hierarchically and disentangledly minimizing 2D SE. Then, to address the issue of audio distortion, we propose a new quantization method. This method still adheres to the 2D SE minimization principle, adaptively selecting the most suitable token corresponding to the cluster for each incoming original speech node. Furthermore, we develop a Structural Entropy-based Speech Language Model (SESLM) that leverages SECodec. Experimental results demonstrate that SECodec performs comparably to EnCodec in speech reconstruction, and SESLM surpasses VALL-E in zero-shot text-to-speech tasks. Code, demo speeches, speech feature graph, SE codebook, and models are available at this https URL.

Title: Sound-Based Recognition of Touch Gestures and Emotions for Enhanced Human-Robot Interaction
Authors: Yuanbo Hou, Qiaoqiao Ren, Wenwu Wang, Dick Botteldooren
Abstract: Emotion recognition and touch gesture decoding are crucial for advancing human-robot interaction (HRI), especially in social environments where emotional cues and tactile perception play important roles. However, many humanoid robots, such as Pepper, Nao, and Furhat, lack full-body tactile skin, limiting their ability to engage in touch-based emotional and gesture interactions. In addition, vision-based emotion recognition methods usually face strict GDPR compliance challenges due to the need to collect personal facial data. To address these limitations and avoid privacy issues, this paper studies the potential of using the sounds produced by touching during HRI to recognise tactile gestures and classify emotions along the arousal and valence dimensions. Using a dataset of tactile gestures and emotional interactions from 28 participants with the humanoid robot Pepper, we design an audio-only lightweight touch gesture and emotion recognition model with only 0.24M parameters, 0.94MB model size, and 0.7G FLOPs. Experimental results show that the proposed sound-based touch gesture and emotion recognition model effectively recognises the arousal and valence states of different emotions, as well as various tactile gestures, when the input audio length varies. The proposed model is low-latency and achieves similar results as well-known pretrained audio neural networks (PANNs), but with much smaller FLOPs, parameters, and model size.

Title: DDD-GenDT: Dynamic Data-driven Generative Digital Twin Framework
Authors: Yu-Zheng Lin, Qinxuan Shi, Zhanglong Yang, Banafsheh Saber Latibari, Sicong Shao, Soheil Salehi, Pratik Satam
Abstract: Digital twin (DT) technology has emerged as a transformative approach to simulate, predict, and optimize the behavior of physical systems, with applications that span manufacturing, healthcare, climate science, and more. However, the development of DT models often faces challenges such as high data requirements, integration complexity, and limited adaptability to dynamic changes in physical systems. This paper presents a new method inspired by dynamic data-driven applications systems (DDDAS), called the dynamic data-driven generative of digital twins framework (DDD-GenDT), which combines the physical system with LLM, allowing LLM to act as DT to interact with the physical system operating status and generate the corresponding physical behaviors. We apply DDD-GenDT to the computer numerical control (CNC) machining process, and we use the spindle current measurement data in the NASA milling wear data set as an example to enable LLMs to forecast the physical behavior from historical data and interact with current observations. Experimental results show that in the zero-shot prediction setting, the LLM-based DT can adapt to the change in the system, and the average RMSE of the GPT-4 prediction is 0.479A, which is 4.79% of the maximum spindle motor current measurement of 10A, with little training data and instructions required. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of DDD-GenDT in this specific application and their potential to construct digital twins. We also discuss the limitations and challenges that may arise in practical implementations.

Title: Lungmix: A Mixup-Based Strategy for Generalization in Respiratory Sound Classification
Authors: Shijia Ge, Weixiang Zhang, Shuzhao Xie, Baixu Yan, Zhi Wang
Abstract: Respiratory sound classification plays a pivotal role in diagnosing respiratory diseases. While deep learning models have shown success with various respiratory sound datasets, our experiments indicate that models trained on one dataset often fail to generalize effectively to others, mainly due to data collection and annotation \emph{inconsistencies}. To address this limitation, we introduce \emph{Lungmix}, a novel data augmentation technique inspired by Mixup. Lungmix generates augmented data by blending waveforms using loudness and random masks while interpolating labels based on their semantic meaning, helping the model learn more generalized representations. Comprehensive evaluations across three datasets, namely ICBHI, SPR, and HF, demonstrate that Lungmix significantly enhances model generalization to unseen data. In particular, Lungmix boosts the 4-class classification score by up to 3.55\%, achieving performance comparable to models trained directly on the target dataset.

Title: Ensemble of classifiers for speech evaluation
Authors: G. Belokrylov, A. Korenev, B. Lodonova, A. Novokhrestov
Abstract: The article describes an attempt to apply an ensemble of binary classifiers to solve the problem of speech assessment in medicine. A dataset was compiled based on quantitative and expert assessments of syllable pronunciation quality. Quantitative assessments of 7 selected metrics were used as features: dynamic time warp distance, Minkowski distance, correlation coefficient, longest common subsequence (LCSS), edit distance of real se-quence (EDR), edit distance with real penalty (ERP), and merge split (MSM). Expert as-sessment of pronunciation quality was used as a class label: class 1 means high-quality speech, class 0 means distorted. A comparison of training results was carried out for five classification methods: logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), naive Bayes (NB), decision trees (DT), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). The results of using the mixture method to build an ensemble of classifiers are also presented. The use of an en-semble for the studied data sets allowed us to slightly increase the classification accuracy compared to the use of individual binary classifiers.

Title: Advancing Technology for Humanity and Earth (+Water+Air)
Authors: Steve Mann, Martin Cooper, Bran Ferren, Thomas M. Coughlin, Paul Travers
Abstract: As technology advances, the integration of physical, virtual, and social worlds has led to a complex landscape of ``Realities'' such as Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), metaverse, spatial computing, and other emerging paradigms. This paper builds upon and refines the concept of eXtended Reality (XR) as the unifying framework that not only interpolates across these diverse realities but also extrapolates (extends) to create entirely new possibilities. XR is the ``physical spatial metaverse,'' bridging the physical world, the virtual world of artificial intelligence, and the social world of human interaction. These three worlds define the Socio-Cyber-Physical Taxonomy of XR that allows us to identify underexplored research areas such as Diminished Reality (DR), and chart future directions to {\bf advance technology for people and planet}. We highlight the six core properties of XR for applications in sustainability, healthcare, frontline work, and daily life. Central to this vision is the development of AI-driven wearable technologies, such as the smart eyeglass, that sustainably extend human capabilities.

Title: Minimalist Vision with Freeform Pixels
Authors: Jeremy Klotz, Shree K. Nayar
Abstract: A minimalist vision system uses the smallest number of pixels needed to solve a vision task. While traditional cameras use a large grid of square pixels, a minimalist camera uses freeform pixels that can take on arbitrary shapes to increase their information content. We show that the hardware of a minimalist camera can be modeled as the first layer of a neural network, where the subsequent layers are used for inference. Training the network for any given task yields the shapes of the camera's freeform pixels, each of which is implemented using a photodetector and an optical mask. We have designed minimalist cameras for monitoring indoor spaces (with 8 pixels), measuring room lighting (with 8 pixels), and estimating traffic flow (with 8 pixels). The performance demonstrated by these systems is on par with a traditional camera with orders of magnitude more pixels. Minimalist vision has two major advantages. First, it naturally tends to preserve the privacy of individuals in the scene since the captured information is inadequate for extracting visual details. Second, since the number of measurements made by a minimalist camera is very small, we show that it can be fully self-powered, i.e., function without an external power supply or a battery.

Abstract: Recent advances in learning-based control have increased interest in stable inversion to meet growing performance demands. Here, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for stable inversion, addressing challenges in non-minimum phase, non-square, and singular systems. An H-Infinity based algebraic approximation is introduced for near-perfect tracking without preview. Additionally, we propose a novel robust control strategy combining the nominal model with dual feedforward control to form a feedback structure. Numerical comparison demonstrates the approach's effectiveness.

Title: Equilibria in Network Constrained Markets with Market Maker
Authors: Giacomo Como, Fabio Fagnani, Leonardo Massai, Martina Vanelli
Abstract: We study a networked economic system composed of $n$ producers supplying a single homogeneous good to a number of geographically separated markets and of a centralized authority, called the market maker. Producers compete à la Cournot, by choosing the quantities of good to supply to each market they have access to in order to maximize their profit. Every market is characterized by its inverse demand functions returning the unit price of the considered good as a function of the total available quantity. Markets are interconnected by a dispatch network through which quantities of the considered good can flow within finite capacity constraints. Such flows are determined by the market maker, who aims at maximizing a designated welfare function. We model such competition as a strategic game with $n+1$ players: the producers and the market game. For this game, we first establish the existence of Nash equilibria under standard concavity assumptions. We then identify sufficient conditions for the game to be potential with an essentially unique Nash equilibrium. Next, we present a general result that connects the optimal action of the market maker with the capacity constraints imposed on the network. For the commonly used Walrasian welfare, our finding proves a connection between capacity bottlenecks in the market network and the emergence of price differences between markets separated by saturated lines. This phenomenon is frequently observed in real-world scenarios, for instance in power networks. Finally, we validate the model with data from the Italian day-ahead electricity market.

Title: ReFormer: Generating Radio Fakes for Data Augmentation
Authors: Yagna Kaasaragadda, Silvija Kokalj-Filipovic
Abstract: We present ReFormer, a generative AI (GAI) model that can efficiently generate synthetic radio-frequency (RF) data, or RF fakes, statistically similar to the data it was trained on, or with modified statistics, in order to augment datasets collected in real-world experiments. For applications like this, adaptability and scalability are important issues. This is why ReFormer leverages transformer-based autoregressive generation, trained on learned discrete representations of RF signals. By using prompts, such GAI can be made to generate the data which complies with specific constraints or conditions, particularly useful for training channel estimation and modeling. It may also leverage the data from a source system to generate training data for a target system. We show how different transformer architectures and other design choices affect the quality of generated RF fakes, evaluated using metrics such as precision and recall, classification accuracy and signal constellation diagrams.

Title: VoxVietnam: a Large-Scale Multi-Genre Dataset for Vietnamese Speaker Recognition
Authors: Hoang Long Vu, Phuong Tuan Dat, Pham Thao Nhi, Nguyen Song Hao, Nguyen Thi Thu Trang
Abstract: Recent research in speaker recognition aims to address vulnerabilities due to variations between enrolment and test utterances, particularly in the multi-genre phenomenon where the utterances are in different speech genres. Previous resources for Vietnamese speaker recognition are either limited in size or do not focus on genre diversity, leaving studies in multi-genre effects unexplored. This paper introduces VoxVietnam, the first multi-genre dataset for Vietnamese speaker recognition with over 187,000 utterances from 1,406 speakers and an automated pipeline to construct a dataset on a large scale from public sources. Our experiments show the challenges posed by the multi-genre phenomenon to models trained on a single-genre dataset, and demonstrate a significant increase in performance upon incorporating the VoxVietnam into the training process. Our experiments are conducted to study the challenges of the multi-genre phenomenon in speaker recognition and the performance gain when the proposed dataset is used for multi-genre training.

Title: Temporal Information Reconstruction and Non-Aligned Residual in Spiking Neural Networks for Speech Classification
Authors: Qi Zhang, Huamin Wang, Hangchi Shen, Shukai Duan, Shiping Wen, Tingwen Huang
Abstract: Recently, it can be noticed that most models based on spiking neural networks (SNNs) only use a same level temporal resolution to deal with speech classification problems, which makes these models cannot learn the information of input data at different temporal scales. Additionally, owing to the different time lengths of the data before and after the sub-modules of many models, the effective residual connections cannot be applied to optimize the training processes of these this http URL solve these problems, on the one hand, we reconstruct the temporal dimension of the audio spectrum to propose a novel method named as Temporal Reconstruction (TR) by referring the hierarchical processing process of the human brain for understanding speech. Then, the reconstructed SNN model with TR can learn the information of input data at different temporal scales and model more comprehensive semantic information from audio data because it enables the networks to learn the information of input data at different temporal resolutions. On the other hand, we propose the Non-Aligned Residual (NAR) method by analyzing the audio data, which allows the residual connection can be used in two audio data with different time lengths. We have conducted plentiful experiments on the Spiking Speech Commands (SSC), the Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD), and the Google Speech Commands v0.02 (GSC) datasets. According to the experiment results, we have achieved the state-of-the-art (SOTA) result 81.02\% on SSC for the test classification accuracy of all SNN models, and we have obtained the SOTA result 96.04\% on SHD for the classification accuracy of all models.

Title: Impossibility of Self-Organized Aggregation without Computation
Authors: Roy Steinberg, Kiril Solovey
Abstract: In their seminal work, Gauci et al. (2014) studied the fundamental task of aggregation, wherein multiple robots need to gather without an a priori agreed-upon meeting location, using minimal hardware. That paper considered differential-drive robots that are memoryless and unable to compute. Moreover, the robots cannot communicate with one another and are only equipped with a simple sensor that determines whether another robot is directly in front of them. Despite those severe limitations, Gauci et al. introduced a controller and proved mathematically that it aggregates a system of two robots for any initial state. Unfortunately, for larger systems, the same controller aggregates empirically in many cases but not all. Thus, the question of whether a controller exists that aggregates for any number of robots remains open. In this paper, we show that no such controller exists by investigating the geometric structure of controllers. In addition, we disprove the aggregation proof of the paper above for two robots and present an alternative controller alongside a simple and rigorous aggregation proof.

Title: TSPE: Task-Specific Prompt Ensemble for Improved Zero-Shot Audio Classification
Authors: Nishit Anand, Ashish Seth, Ramani Duraiswami, Dinesh Manocha
Abstract: Audio-language models (ALMs) excel in zero-shot audio classification, a task where models classify previously unseen audio clips at test time by leveraging descriptive natural language prompts. We introduce TSPE (Task-Specific Prompt Ensemble), a simple, training-free hard prompting method that boosts ALEs' zero-shot performance by customizing prompts for diverse audio classification tasks. Rather than using generic template-based prompts like "Sound of a car" we generate context-rich prompts, such as "Sound of a car coming from a tunnel". Specifically, we leverage label information to identify suitable sound attributes, such as "loud" and "feeble", and appropriate sound sources, such as "tunnel" and "street" and incorporate this information into the prompts used by Audio-Language Models (ALMs) for audio classification. Further, to enhance audio-text alignment, we perform prompt ensemble across TSPE-generated task-specific prompts. When evaluated on 12 diverse audio classification datasets, TSPE improves performance across ALMs by showing an absolute improvement of 1.23-16.36% over vanilla zero-shot evaluation.

Title: Movable Superdirective Pairs: A Phase Shifter-Free Approach to mmWave Communications
Authors: Liangcheng Han, Haifan Yin, Mengying Gao, Rui Zhang
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a novel Movable Superdirective Pairs (MSP) approach that combines movable antennas with superdirective pair arrays to enhance the performance of millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications on the user side. By controlling the rotation angles and positions of superdirective antenna pairs, the proposed MSP approach maximizes the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of multipath signals without relying on phase shifters or attenuators. This approach addresses the limitations of traditional superdirective antennas, which are typically restricted to the endfire direction and suffer from reduced scanning bandwidth and increased complexity. An efficient algorithm based on alternating optimization and the gradient projection method is developed to solve the non-convex optimization problem of antennas' joint rotating positioning. Simulation results demonstrate that the MSP approach achieves significant performance gains over fixed-position array (FPA) employing Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC), while reducing system complexity and hardware costs.

Title: Whisper Turns Stronger: Augmenting Wav2Vec 2.0 for Superior ASR in Low-Resource Languages
Authors: Or Haim Anidjar, Revital Marbel, Roi Yozevitch
Abstract: Approaching Speech-to-Text and Automatic Speech Recognition problems in low-resource languages is notoriously challenging due to the scarcity of validated datasets and the diversity of dialects. Arabic, Russian, and Portuguese exemplify these difficulties, being low-resource languages due to the many dialects of these languages across different continents worldwide. Moreover, the variety of accents and pronunciations of such languages complicate ASR models' success. With the increasing popularity of Deep Learning and Transformers, acoustic models like the renowned Wav2Vec2 have achieved superior performance in the Speech Recognition field compared to state-of-the-art approaches. However, despite Wav2Vec2's improved efficiency over traditional methods, its performance significantly declines for under-represented languages, even though it requires significantly less labeled data. This paper introduces an end-to-end framework that enhances ASR systems fine-tuned on Wav2Vec2 through data augmentation techniques. To validate our framework's effectiveness, we conducted a detailed experimental evaluation using three datasets from Mozilla's Common Voice project in Arabic, Russian, and Portuguese. Additionally, the framework presented in this paper demonstrates robustness to different diacritics. Ultimately, our approach outperforms two previous baseline models, which are the pre-trained Wav2Vec2 and the well-known Whisper ASR model, resulting in an average relative improvement of 33.9\% in Word Error Rate and a 53.2\% relative improvement in Character Error Rate.

Title: Unrolled Creative Adversarial Network For Generating Novel Musical Pieces
Authors: Pratik Nag
Abstract: Music generation has been established as a prominent topic in artificial intelligence and machine learning over recent years. In most recent works on RNN-based neural network methods have been applied for sequence generation. In contrast, generative adversarial networks (GANs) and their counterparts have been explored by very few researchersfor music generation. In this paper, a classical system was employed alongside a new system to generate creative music. Both systems were designed based on adversarial networks to generate music by learning from examples. The classical system was trained to learn a set of music pieces without differentiating between classes, whereas the new system was trained to learn the different composers and their styles to generate a creative music piece by deviating from the learned composers' styles. The base structure utilized was generative adversarial networks (GANs), which are capable of generating novel outputs given a set of inputs to learn from and mimic their distribution. It has been shown in previous work that GANs are limited in their original design with respect to creative outputs. Building on the Creative Adversarial Networks (CAN) , this work applied them in the music domain rather than the visual art domain. Additionally, unrolled CAN was introduced to prevent mode collapse. Experiments were conducted on both GAN and CAN for generating music, and their capabilities were measured in terms of deviation from the input set.

Title: Addressing Challenges in Data Quality and Model Generalization for Malaria Detection
Authors: Kiswendsida Kisito Kabore, Desire Guel
Abstract: Malaria remains a significant global health burden, particularly in resource-limited regions where timely and accurate diagnosis is critical to effective treatment and control. Deep Learning (DL) has emerged as a transformative tool for automating malaria detection and it offers high accuracy and scalability. However, the effectiveness of these models is constrained by challenges in data quality and model generalization including imbalanced datasets, limited diversity and annotation variability. These issues reduce diagnostic reliability and hinder real-world applicability. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of these challenges and their implications for malaria detection performance. Key findings highlight the impact of data imbalances which can lead to a 20\% drop in F1-score and regional biases which significantly hinder model generalization. Proposed solutions, such as GAN-based augmentation, improved accuracy by 15-20\% by generating synthetic data to balance classes and enhance dataset diversity. Domain adaptation techniques, including transfer learning, further improved cross-domain robustness by up to 25\% in sensitivity. Additionally, the development of diverse global datasets and collaborative data-sharing frameworks is emphasized as a cornerstone for equitable and reliable malaria diagnostics. The role of explainable AI techniques in improving clinical adoption and trustworthiness is also underscored. By addressing these challenges, this work advances the field of AI-driven malaria detection and provides actionable insights for researchers and practitioners. The proposed solutions aim to support the development of accessible and accurate diagnostic tools, particularly for resource-constrained populations.

Title: Fotheidil: an Automatic Transcription System for the Irish Language
Authors: Liam Lonergan, Ibon Saratxaga, John Sloan, Oscar Maharog, Mengjie Qian, Neasa Ní Chiaráin, Christer Gobl, Ailbhe Ní Chasaide
Abstract: This paper sets out the first web-based transcription system for the Irish language - Fotheidil, a system that utilises speech-related AI technologies as part of the ABAIR initiative. The system includes both off-the-shelf pre-trained voice activity detection and speaker diarisation models and models trained specifically for Irish automatic speech recognition and capitalisation and punctuation restoration. Semi-supervised learning is explored to improve the acoustic model of a modular TDNN-HMM ASR system, yielding substantial improvements for out-of-domain test sets and dialects that are underrepresented in the supervised training set. A novel approach to capitalisation and punctuation restoration involving sequence-to-sequence models is compared with the conventional approach using a classification model. Experimental results show here also substantial improvements in performance. The system will be made freely available for public use, and represents an important resource to researchers and others who transcribe Irish language materials. Human-corrected transcriptions will be collected and included in the training dataset as the system is used, which should lead to incremental improvements to the ASR model in a cyclical, community-driven fashion.

Title: Performance Analysis and Optimization of STAR-RIS-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems Relying on Imperfect Hardware
Authors: Zeping Sui, Hien Quoc Ngo, Michail Matthaiou, Lajos Hanzo
Abstract: Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS)-aided cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems are investigated under spatially correlated fading channels using realistic imperfect hardware. Specifically, the transceiver distortions, \textcolor{black}{time-varying phase noise, and RIS phase shift errors} are considered. Upon considering imperfect hardware and pilot contamination, we derive a linear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion-based cascaded channel estimator. Moreover, a closed-form expression of the downlink ergodic spectral efficiency (SE) is derived based on maximum ratio (MR) based transmit precoding and channel statistics, where both a finite number of access points (APs) and STAR-RIS elements as well as imperfect hardware are considered. Furthermore, by exploiting the ergodic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) among user equipment (UE), a max-min fairness problem is formulated for the joint optimization of the passive transmitting and reflecting beamforming (BF) at the STAR-RIS as well as of the power control coefficients. An alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed for solving the resultant problems, where iterative adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) and bisection methods are proposed for circumventing the non-convexity of the RIS passive BF and the quasi-concave power control sub-problems, respectively. Our simulation results illustrate that the STAR-RIS-aided CF-mMIMO system attains higher SE than its RIS-aided counterpart. The performance of different hardware parameters is also evaluated. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the SE of the worst UE can be significantly improved by exploiting the proposed AO-based algorithm compared to conventional solutions associated with random passive BF and equal-power scenarios.

Title: So Timely, Yet So Stale: The Impact of Clock Drift in Real-Time Systems
Authors: Mehrdad Salimnejad, Nikolaos Pappas, Marios Kountouris
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of timely delivery of status update packets in a real-time communication system, where a transmitter sends status updates generated by a source to a receiver over an unreliable channel. The timestamps of transmitted and received packets are measured using separate clocks located at the transmitter and receiver, respectively. To account for possible clock drift between these two clocks, we consider both deterministic and probabilistic drift scenarios. We analyze the system's performance regarding the Age of Information (AoI) and derive closed-form expressions for the distribution and the average AoI under both clock drift models. Additionally, we explore the impact of key system parameters on the average AoI through analytical and numerical results.

Title: Optimizing Speech-Input Length for Speaker-Independent Depression Classification
Authors: Tomasz Rutowski, Amir Harati, Yang Lu, Elizabeth Shriberg
Abstract: Machine learning models for speech-based depression classification offer promise for health care applications. Despite growing work on depression classification, little is understood about how the length of speech-input impacts model performance. We analyze results for speaker-independent depression classification using a corpus of over 1400 hours of speech from a human-machine health screening application. We examine performance as a function of response input length for two NLP systems that differ in overall performance. Results for both systems show that performance depends on natural length, elapsed length, and ordering of the response within a session. Systems share a minimum length threshold, but differ in a response saturation threshold, with the latter higher for the better system. At saturation it is better to pose a new question to the speaker, than to continue the current response. These and additional reported results suggest how applications can be better designed to both elicit and process optimal input lengths for depression classification.

Title: Toward Corpus Size Requirements for Training and Evaluating Depression Risk Models Using Spoken Language
Authors: Tomek Rutowski, Amir Harati, Elizabeth Shriberg, Yang Lu, Piotr Chlebek, Ricardo Oliveira
Abstract: Mental health risk prediction is a growing field in the speech community, but many studies are based on small corpora. This study illustrates how variations in test and train set sizes impact performance in a controlled study. Using a corpus of over 65K labeled data points, results from a fully crossed design of different train/test size combinations are provided. Two model types are included: one based on language and the other on speech acoustics. Both use methods current in this domain. An age-mismatched test set was also included. Results show that (1) test sizes below 1K samples gave noisy results, even for larger training set sizes; (2) training set sizes of at least 2K were needed for stable results; (3) NLP and acoustic models behaved similarly with train/test size variations, and (4) the mismatched test set showed the same patterns as the matched test set. Additional factors are discussed, including label priors, model strength and pre-training, unique speakers, and data lengths. While no single study can specify exact size requirements, results demonstrate the need for appropriately sized train and test sets for future studies of mental health risk prediction from speech and language.

Title: SoundBrush: Sound as a Brush for Visual Scene Editing
Authors: Kim Sung-Bin, Kim Jun-Seong, Junseok Ko, Yewon Kim, Tae-Hyun Oh
Abstract: We propose SoundBrush, a model that uses sound as a brush to edit and manipulate visual scenes. We extend the generative capabilities of the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to incorporate audio information for editing visual scenes. Inspired by existing image-editing works, we frame this task as a supervised learning problem and leverage various off-the-shelf models to construct a sound-paired visual scene dataset for training. This richly generated dataset enables SoundBrush to learn to map audio features into the textual space of the LDM, allowing for visual scene editing guided by diverse in-the-wild sound. Unlike existing methods, SoundBrush can accurately manipulate the overall scenery or even insert sounding objects to best match the audio inputs while preserving the original content. Furthermore, by integrating with novel view synthesis techniques, our framework can be extended to edit 3D scenes, facilitating sound-driven 3D scene manipulation. Demos are available at this https URL.

Title: A Survey of Secure Semantic Communications
Authors: Rui Meng, Song Gao, Dayu Fan, Haixiao Gao, Yining Wang, Xiaodong Xu, Bizhu Wang, Suyu Lv, Zhidi Zhang, Mengying Sun, Shujun Han, Chen Dong, Xiaofeng Tao, Ping Zhang
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) is regarded as a promising and revolutionary technology in 6G, aiming to transcend the constraints of ``Shannon's trap" by filtering out redundant information and extracting the core of effective data. Compared to traditional communication paradigms, SemCom offers several notable advantages, such as reducing the burden on data transmission, enhancing network management efficiency, and optimizing resource allocation. Numerous researchers have extensively explored SemCom from various perspectives, including network architecture, theoretical analysis, potential technologies, and future applications. However, as SemCom continues to evolve, a multitude of security and privacy concerns have arisen, posing threats to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of SemCom systems. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the technologies that can be utilized to secure SemCom. Firstly, we elaborate on the entire life cycle of SemCom, which includes the model training, model transfer, and semantic information transmission phases. Then, we identify the security and privacy issues that emerge during these three stages. Furthermore, we summarize the techniques available to mitigate these security and privacy threats, including data cleaning, robust learning, defensive strategies against backdoor attacks, adversarial training, differential privacy, cryptography, blockchain technology, model compression, and physical-layer security. Lastly, this paper outlines future research directions to guide researchers in related fields.

Title: U-GIFT: Uncertainty-Guided Firewall for Toxic Speech in Few-Shot Scenario
Authors: Jiaxin Song, Xinyu Wang, Yihao Wang, Yifan Tang, Ru Zhang, Jianyi Liu, Gongshen Liu
Abstract: With the widespread use of social media, user-generated content has surged on online platforms. When such content includes hateful, abusive, offensive, or cyberbullying behavior, it is classified as toxic speech, posing a significant threat to the online ecosystem's integrity and safety. While manual content moderation is still prevalent, the overwhelming volume of content and the psychological strain on human moderators underscore the need for automated toxic speech detection. Previously proposed detection methods often rely on large annotated datasets; however, acquiring such datasets is both costly and challenging in practice. To address this issue, we propose an uncertainty-guided firewall for toxic speech in few-shot scenarios, U-GIFT, that utilizes self-training to enhance detection performance even when labeled data is limited. Specifically, U-GIFT combines active learning with Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) to automatically identify high-quality samples from unlabeled data, prioritizing the selection of pseudo-labels with higher confidence for training based on uncertainty estimates derived from model predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that U-GIFT significantly outperforms competitive baselines in few-shot detection scenarios. In the 5-shot setting, it achieves a 14.92\% performance improvement over the basic model. Importantly, U-GIFT is user-friendly and adaptable to various pre-trained language models (PLMs). It also exhibits robust performance in scenarios with sample imbalance and cross-domain settings, while showcasing strong generalization across various language applications. We believe that U-GIFT provides an efficient solution for few-shot toxic speech detection, offering substantial support for automated content moderation in cyberspace, thereby acting as a firewall to promote advancements in cybersecurity.

Title: RIS-Aided Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems under Dual-polarized Channels
Authors: Dongnan Xia, Cunhua Pan, Hong Ren, Zhiyuan Yu, Yasheng Jin, Jiangzhou Wang
Abstract: This paper considers reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems under dual-polarized (DP) channels. Unlike the existing ISAC systems, which ignored polarization of electromagnetic waves, this study adopts DP base station (BS) and DP RIS to serve users with a pair of DP antennas. The achievable sum rate is maximized through jointly optimizing the beamforming matrix at the DP BS, and the reflecting coefficients at the DP RIS. To address this problem, we first utilize the weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) method to transform the objective function into a more tractable form, and then an alternating optimization (AO) method is employed to decouple the original problem into two subproblems. Due to the constant modulus constraint, the DP RIS reflection matrix optimization problem is addressed by the majorization-minimization (MM) method. For the DP beamforming matrix, we propose a penalty-based algorithm that can obtain a low-complexity closed-form solution. Simulation results validate the advantage of deploying DP transmit array and DP RIS in the considered ISAC systems.

Title: Diffusion Policies for Generative Modeling of Spacecraft Trajectories
Authors: Julia Briden, Breanna Johnson, Richard Linares, Abhishek Cauligi
Abstract: Machine learning has demonstrated remarkable promise for solving the trajectory generation problem and in paving the way for online use of trajectory optimization for resource-constrained spacecraft. However, a key shortcoming in current machine learning-based methods for trajectory generation is that they require large datasets and even small changes to the original trajectory design requirements necessitate retraining new models to learn the parameter-to-solution mapping. In this work, we leverage compositional diffusion modeling to efficiently adapt out-of-distribution data and problem variations in a few-shot framework for 6 degree-of-freedom (DoF) powered descent trajectory generation. Unlike traditional deep learning methods that can only learn the underlying structure of one specific trajectory optimization problem, diffusion models are a powerful generative modeling framework that represents the solution as a probability density function (PDF) and this allows for the composition of PDFs encompassing a variety of trajectory design specifications and constraints. We demonstrate the capability of compositional diffusion models for inference-time 6 DoF minimum-fuel landing site selection and composable constraint representations. Using these samples as initial guesses for 6 DoF powered descent guidance enables dynamically feasible and computationally efficient trajectory generation.

Title: Tight Constraint Prediction of Six-Degree-of-Freedom Transformer-based Powered Descent Guidance
Authors: Julia Briden, Trey Gurga, Breanna Johnson, Abhishek Cauligi, Richard Linares
Abstract: This work introduces Transformer-based Successive Convexification (T-SCvx), an extension of Transformer-based Powered Descent Guidance (T-PDG), generalizable for efficient six-degree-of-freedom (DoF) fuel-optimal powered descent trajectory generation. Our approach significantly enhances the sample efficiency and solution quality for nonconvex-powered descent guidance by employing a rotation invariant transformation of the sampled dataset. T-PDG was previously applied to the 3-DoF minimum fuel powered descent guidance problem, improving solution times by up to an order of magnitude compared to lossless convexification (LCvx). By learning to predict the set of tight or active constraints at the optimal control problem's solution, Transformer-based Successive Convexification (T-SCvx) creates the minimal reduced-size problem initialized with only the tight constraints, then uses the solution of this reduced problem to warm-start the direct optimization solver. 6-DoF powered descent guidance is known to be challenging to solve quickly and reliably due to the nonlinear and non-convex nature of the problem, the discretization scheme heavily influencing solution validity, and reference trajectory initialization determining algorithm convergence or divergence. Our contributions in this work address these challenges by extending T-PDG to learn the set of tight constraints for the successive convexification (SCvx) formulation of the 6-DoF powered descent guidance problem. In addition to reducing the problem size, feasible and locally optimal reference trajectories are also learned to facilitate convergence from the initial guess. T-SCvx enables onboard computation of real-time guidance trajectories, demonstrated by a 6-DoF Mars powered landing application problem.

Title: Diffusion Prism: Enhancing Diversity and Morphology Consistency in Mask-to-Image Diffusion
Authors: Hao Wang, Xiwen Chen, Ashish Bastola, Jiayou Qin, Abolfazl Razi
Abstract: The emergence of generative AI and controllable diffusion has made image-to-image synthesis increasingly practical and efficient. However, when input images exhibit low entropy and sparse, the inherent characteristics of diffusion models often result in limited diversity. This constraint significantly interferes with data augmentation. To address this, we propose Diffusion Prism, a training-free framework that efficiently transforms binary masks into realistic and diverse samples while preserving morphological features. We explored that a small amount of artificial noise will significantly assist the image-denoising process. To prove this novel mask-to-image concept, we use nano-dendritic patterns as an example to demonstrate the merit of our method compared to existing controllable diffusion models. Furthermore, we extend the proposed framework to other biological patterns, highlighting its potential applications across various fields.

Title: The Silent Majority: Demystifying Memorization Effect in the Presence of Spurious Correlations
Authors: Chenyu You, Haocheng Dai, Yifei Min, Jasjeet S. Sekhon, Sarang Joshi, James S. Duncan
Abstract: Machine learning models often rely on simple spurious features -- patterns in training data that correlate with targets but are not causally related to them, like image backgrounds in foreground classification. This reliance typically leads to imbalanced test performance across minority and majority groups. In this work, we take a closer look at the fundamental cause of such imbalanced performance through the lens of memorization, which refers to the ability to predict accurately on \textit{atypical} examples (minority groups) in the training set but failing in achieving the same accuracy in the testing set. This paper systematically shows the ubiquitous existence of spurious features in a small set of neurons within the network, providing the first-ever evidence that memorization may contribute to imbalanced group performance. Through three experimental sources of converging empirical evidence, we find the property of a small subset of neurons or channels in memorizing minority group information. Inspired by these findings, we articulate the hypothesis: the imbalanced group performance is a byproduct of ``noisy'' spurious memorization confined to a small set of neurons. To further substantiate this hypothesis, we show that eliminating these unnecessary spurious memorization patterns via a novel framework during training can significantly affect the model performance on minority groups. Our experimental results across various architectures and benchmarks offer new insights on how neural networks encode core and spurious knowledge, laying the groundwork for future research in demystifying robustness to spurious correlation.

Title: RealTime Health Monitoring Using 5G Networks: A Deep Learning-Based Architecture for Remote Patient Care
Authors: Iqra Batool
Abstract: Remote patient monitoring is crucial in modern healthcare, but current systems struggle with real-time analysis and prediction of vital signs. This paper presents a novel architecture combining deep learning with 5G network capabilities to enable real-time vital sign monitoring and prediction. The proposed system utilizes a hybrid CNN-LSTM model optimized for edge deployment, paired with 5G Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) for efficient data transmission. The architecture achieves end-to-end latency of 14.4ms while maintaining 96.5% prediction accuracy across multiple vital signs. Our system shows significant improvements over existing solutions, reducing latency by 47% and increasing prediction accuracy by 4.2% compared to current state-of-the-art systems. Performance evaluations conducted over three months with data from 1000 patients validate the system's reliability and scalability in clinical settings. The results demonstrate that integrating deep learning with 5G technology can effectively address the challenges of real-time patient monitoring, leading to early detection of deteriorating conditions and improved clinical outcomes. This research establishes a framework for reliable, real-time vital sign monitoring and prediction in digital healthcare.

Title: Advancing Singlish Understanding: Bridging the Gap with Datasets and Multimodal Models
Authors: Bin Wang, Xunlong Zou, Shuo Sun, Wenyu Zhang, Yingxu He, Zhuohan Liu, Chengwei Wei, Nancy F. Chen, AiTi Aw
Abstract: Singlish, a Creole language rooted in English, is a key focus in linguistic research within multilingual and multicultural contexts. However, its spoken form remains underexplored, limiting insights into its linguistic structure and applications. To address this gap, we standardize and annotate the largest spoken Singlish corpus, introducing the Multitask National Speech Corpus (MNSC). These datasets support diverse tasks, including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Spoken Question Answering (SQA), Spoken Dialogue Summarization (SDS), and Paralinguistic Question Answering (PQA). We release standardized splits and a human-verified test set to facilitate further research. Additionally, we propose SingAudioLLM, a multi-task multimodal model leveraging multimodal large language models to handle these tasks concurrently. Experiments reveal our models adaptability to Singlish context, achieving state-of-the-art performance and outperforming prior models by 10-30% in comparison with other AudioLLMs and cascaded solutions.

Title: Energy-Efficient and Intelligent ISAC in V2X Networks with Spiking Neural Networks-Driven DRL
Authors: Chen Shang, Jiadong Yu, Dinh Thai Hoang
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a pivotal technology for enabling vehicle-to-everything (V2X) connectivity, mobility, and security. However, designing efficient beamforming schemes to achieve accurate sensing and enhance communication performance in the dynamic and uncertain environments of V2X networks presents significant challenges. While AI technologies offer promising solutions, the energy-intensive nature of neural networks (NNs) imposes substantial burdens on communication infrastructures. This work proposes an energy-efficient and intelligent ISAC system for V2X networks. Specifically, we first leverage a Markov Decision Process framework to model the dynamic and uncertain nature of V2X networks. This framework allows the roadside unit (RSU) to develop beamforming schemes relying solely on its current sensing state information, eliminating the need for numerous pilot signals and extensive channel state information acquisition. To endow the system with intelligence and enhance its performance, we then introduce an advanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm based on the Actor-Critic framework with a policy-clipping technique, enabling the joint optimization of beamforming and power allocation strategies to guarantee both communication rate and sensing accuracy. Furthermore, to alleviate the energy demands of NNs, we integrate Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) into the DRL algorithm. By leveraging discrete spikes and their temporal characteristics for information transmission, SNNs not only significantly reduce the energy consumption of deploying AI model in ISAC-assisted V2X networks but also further enhance algorithm performance. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme with lower energy consumption, superior communication performance, and improved sensing accuracy.

Title: HPC Application Parameter Autotuning on Edge Devices: A Bandit Learning Approach
Authors: Abrar Hossain, Abdel-Hameed A. Badawy, Mohammad A. Islam, Tapasya Patki, Kishwar Ahmed
Abstract: The growing necessity for enhanced processing capabilities in edge devices with limited resources has led us to develop effective methods for improving high-performance computing (HPC) applications. In this paper, we introduce LASP (Lightweight Autotuning of Scientific Application Parameters), a novel strategy designed to address the parameter search space challenge in edge devices. Our strategy employs a multi-armed bandit (MAB) technique focused on online exploration and exploitation. Notably, LASP takes a dynamic approach, adapting seamlessly to changing environments. We tested LASP with four HPC applications: Lulesh, Kripke, Clomp, and Hypre. Its lightweight nature makes it particularly well-suited for resource-constrained edge devices. By employing the MAB framework to efficiently navigate the search space, we achieved significant performance improvements while adhering to the stringent computational limits of edge devices. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LASP in optimizing parameter search on edge devices.

Title: MMVA: Multimodal Matching Based on Valence and Arousal across Images, Music, and Musical Captions
Authors: Suhwan Choi, Kyu Won Kim, Myungjoo Kang
Abstract: We introduce Multimodal Matching based on Valence and Arousal (MMVA), a tri-modal encoder framework designed to capture emotional content across images, music, and musical captions. To support this framework, we expand the Image-Music-Emotion-Matching-Net (IMEMNet) dataset, creating IMEMNet-C which includes 24,756 images and 25,944 music clips with corresponding musical captions. We employ multimodal matching scores based on the continuous valence (emotional positivity) and arousal (emotional intensity) values. This continuous matching score allows for random sampling of image-music pairs during training by computing similarity scores from the valence-arousal values across different modalities. Consequently, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in valence-arousal prediction tasks. Furthermore, the framework demonstrates its efficacy in various zeroshot tasks, highlighting the potential of valence and arousal predictions in downstream applications.

Title: FAST: Fast Audio Spectrogram Transformer
Authors: Anugunj Naman, Gaibo Zhang
Abstract: In audio classification, developing efficient and robust models is critical for real-time applications. Inspired by the design principles of MobileViT, we present FAST (Fast Audio Spectrogram Transformer), a new architecture that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers to capitalize on the strengths of both. FAST integrates the local feature extraction efficiencies of CNNs with the global context modeling capabilities of transformers, resulting in a model that is powerful yet lightweight, well-suited to a real-time or mobile use case. Additionally, we incorporate Lipschitz continuous attention mechanisms to improve training stability and accelerate convergence. We evaluate FAST on the ADIMA dataset, a multilingual corpus towards real-time profanity and abuse detection, as well as on the more traditional AudioSet. Our results show that FAST achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the ADIMA and AudioSet classification tasks and in some cases surpasses existing benchmarks while using up to 150x fewer parameters.

Title: MuQ: Self-Supervised Music Representation Learning with Mel Residual Vector Quantization
Authors: Haina Zhu, Yizhi Zhou, Hangting Chen, Jianwei Yu, Ziyang Ma, Rongzhi Gu, Wei Tan, Xie Chen
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the success of foundation models pre-trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) in various music informatics understanding tasks, including music tagging, instrument classification, key detection, and more. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised music representation learning model for music understanding. Distinguished from previous studies adopting random projection or existing neural codec, the proposed model, named MuQ, is trained to predict tokens generated by Mel Residual Vector Quantization (Mel-RVQ). Our Mel-RVQ utilizes residual linear projection structure for Mel spectrum quantization to enhance the stability and efficiency of target extraction and lead to better performance. Experiments in a large variety of downstream tasks demonstrate that MuQ outperforms previous self-supervised music representation models with only 0.9K hours of open-source pre-training data. Scaling up the data to over 160K hours and adopting iterative training consistently improve the model performance. To further validate the strength of our model, we present MuQ-MuLan, a joint music-text embedding model based on contrastive learning, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in the zero-shot music tagging task on the MagnaTagATune dataset. Code and checkpoints are open source in this https URL.

First, the proposed robot controller board has been specially designed for emerging IoT-based robot applications and is capable of driving two 6-Amp motor channels. The controller board also embeds an on-board micro-controller with WIFI connectivity, enabling robot-to-server communications for IoT applications. Then, working together with the robot controller board, the proposed positioning system detects the robot's location using a down-looking webcam and uses the robot's position on the webcam images to estimate the real-world position of the robot in the environment. The positioning system can then send commands via WIFI to the robot in order to steer it to any arbitrary location in the environment. Our experiments show that the proposed system reaches a navigation error smaller or equal to 0.125 meters while being more than two orders of magnitude more cost-effective compared to off-the-shelve motion capture (MOCAP) positioning systems.

Title: Robust COVID-19 Detection from Cough Sounds using Deep Neural Decision Tree and Forest: A Comprehensive Cross-Datasets Evaluation
Authors: Rofiqul Islam, Nihad Karim Chowdhury, Muhammad Ashad Kabir
Abstract: This research presents a robust approach to classifying COVID-19 cough sounds using cutting-edge machine-learning techniques. Leveraging deep neural decision trees and deep neural decision forests, our methodology demonstrates consistent performance across diverse cough sound datasets. We begin with a comprehensive extraction of features to capture a wide range of audio features from individuals, whether COVID-19 positive or negative. To determine the most important features, we use recursive feature elimination along with cross-validation. Bayesian optimization fine-tunes hyper-parameters of deep neural decision tree and deep neural decision forest models. Additionally, we integrate the SMOTE during training to ensure a balanced representation of positive and negative data. Model performance refinement is achieved through threshold optimization, maximizing the ROC-AUC score. Our approach undergoes a comprehensive evaluation in five datasets: Cambridge, Coswara, COUGHVID, Virufy, and the combined Virufy with the NoCoCoDa dataset. Consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods, our proposed approach yields notable AUC scores of 0.97, 0.98, 0.92, 0.93, 0.99, and 0.99 across the respective datasets. Merging all datasets into a combined dataset, our method, using a deep neural decision forest classifier, achieves an AUC of 0.97. Also, our study includes a comprehensive cross-datasets analysis, revealing demographic and geographic differences in the cough sounds associated with COVID-19. These differences highlight the challenges in transferring learned features across diverse datasets and underscore the potential benefits of dataset integration, improving generalizability and enhancing COVID-19 detection from audio signals.

Title: Semantics-Guided Diffusion for Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding in Wireless Image Transmission
Authors: Maojun Zhang, Haotian Wu, Guangxu Zhu, Richeng Jin, Xiaoming Chen, Deniz Gündüz
Abstract: Joint source-channel coding (JSCC) offers a promising avenue for enhancing transmission efficiency by jointly incorporating source and channel statistics into the system design. A key advancement in this area is the deep joint source and channel coding (DeepJSCC) technique that designs a direct mapping of input signals to channel symbols parameterized by a neural network, which can be trained for arbitrary channel models and semantic quality metrics. This paper advances the DeepJSCC framework toward a semantics-aligned, high-fidelity transmission approach, called semantics-guided diffusion DeepJSCC (SGD-JSCC). Existing schemes that integrate diffusion models (DMs) with JSCC face challenges in transforming random generation into accurate reconstruction and adapting to varying channel conditions. SGD-JSCC incorporates two key innovations: (1) utilizing some inherent information that contributes to the semantics of an image, such as text description or edge map, to guide the diffusion denoising process; and (2) enabling seamless adaptability to varying channel conditions with the help of a semantics-guided DM for channel denoising. The DM is guided by diverse semantic information and integrates seamlessly with DeepJSCC. In a slow fading channel, SGD-JSCC dynamically adapts to the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) directly estimated from the channel output, thereby eliminating the need for additional pilot transmissions for channel estimation. In a fast fading channel, we introduce a training-free denoising strategy, allowing SGD-JSCC to effectively adjust to fluctuations in channel gains. Numerical results demonstrate that, guided by semantic information and leveraging the powerful DM, our method outperforms existing DeepJSCC schemes, delivering satisfactory reconstruction performance even at extremely poor channel conditions.

Title: RingFormer: A Neural Vocoder with Ring Attention and Convolution-Augmented Transformer
Authors: Seongho Hong, Yong-Hoon Choi
Abstract: While transformers demonstrate outstanding performance across various audio tasks, their application to neural vocoders remains challenging. Neural vocoders require the generation of long audio signals at the sample level, which demands high temporal resolution. This results in significant computational costs for attention map generation and limits their ability to efficiently process both global and local information. Additionally, the sequential nature of sample generation in neural vocoders poses difficulties for real-time processing, making the direct adoption of transformers impractical. To address these challenges, we propose RingFormer, a neural vocoder that incorporates the ring attention mechanism into a lightweight transformer variant, the convolution-augmented transformer (Conformer). Ring attention effectively captures local details while integrating global information, making it well-suited for processing long sequences and enabling real-time audio generation. RingFormer is trained using adversarial training with two discriminators. The proposed model is applied to the decoder of the text-to-speech model VITS and compared with state-of-the-art vocoders such as HiFi-GAN, iSTFT-Net, and BigVGAN under identical conditions using various objective and subjective metrics. Experimental results show that RingFormer achieves comparable or superior performance to existing models, particularly excelling in real-time audio generation. Our code and audio samples are available on GitHub.

Title: SVFR: A Unified Framework for Generalized Video Face Restoration
Authors: Zhiyao Wang, Xu Chen, Chengming Xu, Junwei Zhu, Xiaobin Hu, Jiangning Zhang, Chengjie Wang, Yuqi Liu, Yiyi Zhou, Rongrong Ji
Abstract: Face Restoration (FR) is a crucial area within image and video processing, focusing on reconstructing high-quality portraits from degraded inputs. Despite advancements in image FR, video FR remains relatively under-explored, primarily due to challenges related to temporal consistency, motion artifacts, and the limited availability of high-quality video data. Moreover, traditional face restoration typically prioritizes enhancing resolution and may not give as much consideration to related tasks such as facial colorization and inpainting. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the Generalized Video Face Restoration (GVFR) task, which integrates video BFR, inpainting, and colorization tasks that we empirically show to benefit each other. We present a unified framework, termed as stable video face restoration (SVFR), which leverages the generative and motion priors of Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) and incorporates task-specific information through a unified face restoration framework. A learnable task embedding is introduced to enhance task identification. Meanwhile, a novel Unified Latent Regularization (ULR) is employed to encourage the shared feature representation learning among different subtasks. To further enhance the restoration quality and temporal stability, we introduce the facial prior learning and the self-referred refinement as auxiliary strategies used for both training and inference. The proposed framework effectively combines the complementary strengths of these tasks, enhancing temporal coherence and achieving superior restoration quality. This work advances the state-of-the-art in video FR and establishes a new paradigm for generalized video face restoration.

Title: Change Detection-Based Procedures for Piecewise Stationary MABs: A Modular Approach
Authors: Yu-Han Huang, Argyrios Gerogiannis, Subhonmesh Bose, Venugopal V. Veeravalli
Abstract: Conventional Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms are designed for stationary environments, where the reward distributions associated with the arms do not change with time. In many applications, however, the environment is more accurately modeled as being nonstationary. In this work, piecewise stationary MAB (PS-MAB) environments are investigated, in which the reward distributions associated with a subset of the arms change at some change-points and remain stationary between change-points. Our focus is on the asymptotic analysis of PS-MABs, for which practical algorithms based on change detection (CD) have been previously proposed. Our goal is to modularize the design and analysis of such CD-based Bandit (CDB) procedures. To this end, we identify the requirements for stationary bandit algorithms and change detectors in a CDB procedure that are needed for the modularization. We assume that the rewards are sub-Gaussian. Under this assumption and a condition on the separation of the change-points, we show that the analysis of CDB procedures can indeed be modularized, so that regret bounds can be obtained in a unified manner for various combinations of change detectors and bandit algorithms. Through this analysis, we develop new modular CDB procedures that are order-optimal. We compare the performance of our modular CDB procedures with various other methods in simulations.

Title: Enhancement of Neural Inertial Regression Networks: A Data-Driven Perspective
Authors: Victoria Khalfin Fekson, Nitsan Pri-Hadash, Netta Palez, Aviad Etzion, Itzik Klein
Abstract: Inertial sensors are integral components in numerous applications, powering crucial features in robotics and our daily lives. In recent years, deep learning has significantly advanced inertial sensing performance and robustness. Deep-learning techniques are used in different domains and platforms to enhance network performance, but no common benchmark is available. The latter is critical for fair comparison and evaluation in a standardized framework as well as development in the field. To fill this gap, we define and thoroughly analyze 13 data-driven techniques for improving neural inertial regression networks. A focus is placed on three aspects of neural networks: network architecture, data augmentation, and data preprocessing. Extensive experiments were made across six diverse datasets that were collected from various platforms including quadrotors, doors, pedestrians, and mobile robots. In total, over 1079 minutes of inertial data sampled between 120-200Hz were analyzed. Our results demonstrate that data augmentation through rotation and noise addition consistently yields the most significant improvements. Moreover, this study outlines benchmarking strategies for enhancing neural inertial regression networks.

Title: AdaptVC: High Quality Voice Conversion with Adaptive Learning
Authors: Jaehun Kim, Ji-Hoon Kim, Yeunju Choi, Tan Dat Nguyen, Seongkyu Mun, Joon Son Chung
Abstract: The goal of voice conversion is to transform the speech of a source speaker to sound like that of a reference speaker while preserving the original content. A key challenge is to extract disentangled linguistic content from the source and voice style from the reference. While existing approaches leverage various methods to isolate the two, a generalization still requires further attention, especially for robustness in zero-shot scenarios. In this paper, we achieve successful disentanglement of content and speaker features by tuning self-supervised speech features with adapters. The adapters are trained to dynamically encode nuanced features from rich self-supervised features, and the decoder fuses them to produce speech that accurately resembles the reference with minimal loss of content. Moreover, we leverage a conditional flow matching decoder with cross-attention speaker conditioning to further boost the synthesis quality and efficiency. Subjective and objective evaluations in a zero-shot scenario demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing models in speech quality and similarity to the reference speech.

Title: OmniChat: Enhancing Spoken Dialogue Systems with Scalable Synthetic Data for Diverse Scenarios
Authors: Xize Cheng, Dongjie Fu, Xiaoda Yang, Minghui Fang, Ruofan Hu, Jingyu Lu, Bai Jionghao, Zehan Wang, Shengpeng Ji, Rongjie Huang, Linjun Li, Yu Chen, Tao Jin, Zhou Zhao
Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models, researchers have created increasingly advanced spoken dialogue systems that can naturally converse with humans. However, these systems still struggle to handle the full complexity of real-world conversations, including audio events, musical contexts, and emotional expressions, mainly because current dialogue datasets are constrained in both scale and scenario diversity. In this paper, we propose leveraging synthetic data to enhance the dialogue models across diverse scenarios. We introduce ShareChatX, the first comprehensive, large-scale dataset for spoken dialogue that spans diverse scenarios. Based on this dataset, we introduce OmniChat, a multi-turn dialogue system with a heterogeneous feature fusion module, designed to optimize feature selection in different dialogue contexts. In addition, we explored critical aspects of training dialogue systems using synthetic data. Through comprehensive experimentation, we determined the ideal balance between synthetic and real data, achieving state-of-the-art results on the real-world dialogue dataset DailyTalk. We also highlight the crucial importance of synthetic data in tackling diverse, complex dialogue scenarios, especially those involving audio and music.

Title: A Multi-task Supervised Compression Model for Split Computing
Authors: Yoshitomo Matsubara, Matteo Mendula, Marco Levorato
Abstract: Split computing ($\neq$ split learning) is a promising approach to deep learning models for resource-constrained edge computing systems, where weak sensor (mobile) devices are wirelessly connected to stronger edge servers through channels with limited communication capacity. State-of-theart work on split computing presents methods for single tasks such as image classification, object detection, or semantic segmentation. The application of existing methods to multitask problems degrades model accuracy and/or significantly increase runtime latency. In this study, we propose Ladon, the first multi-task-head supervised compression model for multi-task split computing. Experimental results show that the multi-task supervised compression model either outperformed or rivaled strong lightweight baseline models in terms of predictive performance for ILSVRC 2012, COCO 2017, and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets while learning compressed representations at its early layers. Furthermore, our models reduced end-to-end latency (by up to 95.4%) and energy consumption of mobile devices (by up to 88.2%) in multi-task split computing scenarios.

Title: An investigation of phrase break prediction in an End-to-End TTS system
Authors: Anandaswarup Vadapalli
Abstract: Purpose: This work explores the use of external phrase break prediction models to enhance listener comprehension in End-to-End Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems. Methods: The effectiveness of these models is evaluated based on listener preferences in subjective tests. Two approaches are explored: (1) a bidirectional LSTM model with task-specific embeddings trained from scratch, and (2) a pre-trained BERT model fine-tuned on phrase break prediction. Both models are trained on a multi-speaker English corpus to predict phrase break locations in text. The End-to-End TTS system used comprises a Tacotron2 model with Dynamic Convolutional Attention for mel spectrogram prediction and a WaveRNN vocoder for waveform generation. Results: The listening tests show a clear preference for text synthesized with predicted phrase breaks over text synthesized without them. Conclusion: These results confirm the value of incorporating external phrasing models within End-to-End TTS to enhance listener comprehension.

Title: Proximal Policy Optimization-Based Reinforcement Learning Approach for DC-DC Boost Converter Control: A Comparative Evaluation Against Traditional Control Techniques
Authors: Utsab Saha, Atik Jawad, Shakib Shahria, A.B.M Harun-Ur Rashid
Abstract: This article proposes a proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning (RL) approach for DC-DC boost converter control that is compared with traditional control methods. The performance of the PPO algorithm is evaluated using MATLAB Simulink co-simulation, and the results demonstrate that the most efficient approach for achieving short settling time and stability is to combine the PPO algorithm with a reinforcement learning-based control method. The simulation results show that the control method based on RL with the PPO algorithm pro vides step response characteristics that outperform traditional control approaches, thereby enhancing DC-DC boost converter control. This research also highlights the inherent capability of the reinforcement learning method to enhance the performance of boost converter control.

Title: Improve Myocardial Strain Estimation based on Deformable Groupwise Registration with a Locally Low-Rank Dissimilarity Metric
Authors: Haiyang Chen, Juan Gao, Zhuo Chen, Chenhao Gao, Sirui Huo, Meng Jiang, Jun Pu, Chenxi Hu
Abstract: Background: Current mainstream cardiovascular magnetic resonance-feature tracking (CMR-FT) methods, including optical flow and pairwise registration, often suffer from the drift effect caused by accumulative tracking errors. Here, we developed a CMR-FT method based on deformable groupwise registration with a locally low-rank (LLR) dissimilarity metric to improve myocardial tracking and strain estimation accuracy. Methods: The proposed method, Groupwise-LLR, performs feature tracking by iteratively updating the entire displacement field across all cardiac phases to minimize the sum of the patchwise signal ranks of the deformed movie. The method was compared with alternative CMR-FT methods including the Farneback optical flow, a sequentially pairwise registration method, and a global low rankness-based groupwise registration method via a simulated dataset (n = 20), a public cine data set (n = 100), and an in-house tagging-MRI patient dataset (n = 16). The proposed method was also compared with two general groupwise registration methods, nD+t B-Splines and pTVreg, in simulations and in vivo tracking. Results: On the simulated dataset, Groupwise-LLR achieved the lowest point tracking errors and voxelwise/global strain errors. On the public dataset, Groupwise-LLR achieved the lowest contour tracking errors, reduced the drift effect in late-diastole, and preserved similar inter-observer reproducibility as the alternative methods. On the patient dataset, Groupwise-LLR correlated better with tagging-MRI for radial strains than the other CMR-FT methods in multiple myocardial segments and levels. Conclusions: The proposed Groupwise-LLR reduces the drift effect and provides more accurate myocardial tracking and strain estimation than the alternative methods. The method may thus facilitate a more accurate estimation of myocardial strains for clinical assessments of cardiac function.

Title: IVIM-Morph: Motion-compensated quantitative Intra-voxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) analysis for functional fetal lung maturity assessment from diffusion-weighted MRI data
Authors: Noga Kertes, Yael Zaffrani-Reznikov, Onur Afacan, Sila Kurugol, Simon K. Warfield, Moti Freiman
Abstract: Quantitative analysis of pseudo-diffusion in diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) data shows potential for assessing fetal lung maturation and generating valuable imaging biomarkers. Yet, the clinical utility of DWI data is hindered by unavoidable fetal motion during acquisition. We present IVIM-morph, a self-supervised deep neural network model for motion-corrected quantitative analysis of DWI data using the Intra-voxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) model. IVIM-morph combines two sub-networks, a registration sub-network, and an IVIM model fitting sub-network, enabling simultaneous estimation of IVIM model parameters and motion. To promote physically plausible image registration, we introduce a biophysically informed loss function that effectively balances registration and model-fitting quality. We validated the efficacy of IVIM-morph by establishing a correlation between the predicted IVIM model parameters of the lung and gestational age (GA) using fetal DWI data of 39 subjects. IVIM-morph exhibited a notably improved correlation with gestational age (GA) when performing in-vivo quantitative analysis of fetal lung DWI data during the canalicular phase. IVIM-morph shows potential in developing valuable biomarkers for non-invasive assessment of fetal lung maturity with DWI data. Moreover, its adaptability opens the door to potential applications in other clinical contexts where motion compensation is essential for quantitative DWI analysis. The IVIM-morph code is readily available at: this https URL.

Title: RIS-Augmented Millimeter-Wave MIMO Systems for Passive Drone Detection
Authors: Jiguang He, Aymen Fakhreddine, George C. Alexandropoulos
Abstract: In the past decade, the number of amateur drones is increasing, and this trend is expected to continue in the future. The security issues brought by abuse and misconduct of drones become more and more severe and may incur a negative impact to the society. In this paper, we leverage existing cellular multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) base station (BS) infrastructure, operating at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency bands, for drone detection in a device-free manner with the aid of one reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), deployed in the proximity of the BS. We theoretically examine the feasibility of drone detection with the aid of the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) and validate via simulations that, the optimized deployment of an RIS can bring added benefits compared to RIS-free systems. In addition, the effect of RIS training beams, training overhead, and radar cross section, is investigated in order to offer theoretical design guidance for the proposed cellular RIS-based passive drone detection system.

Title: Device-Free 3D Drone Localization in RIS-Assisted mmWave MIMO Networks
Authors: Jiguang He, Charles Vanwynsberghe, Hui Chen, Chongwen Huang, Aymen Fakhreddine
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the potential of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in facilitating passive/device-free three-dimensional (3D) drone localization within existing cellular infrastructure operating at millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies and employing multiple antennas at the transceivers. The developed localization system operates in the bi-static mode without requiring direct communication between the drone and the base station. We analyze the theoretical performance limits via Fisher information analysis and Cramér Rao lower bounds (CRLBs). Furthermore, we develop a low-complexity yet effective drone localization algorithm based on coordinate gradient descent and examine the impact of factors such as radar cross section (RCS) of the drone and training overhead on system performance. It is demonstrated that integrating RIS yields significant benefits over its RIS-free counterpart, as evidenced by both theoretical analyses and numerical simulations.

Title: A hybrid systems framework for data-based adaptive control of linear time-varying systems
Authors: Andrea Iannelli, Romain Postoyan
Abstract: We consider the data-driven stabilization of discrete-time linear time-varying systems. The controller is defined as a linear state-feedback law whose gain is adapted to the plant changes through a data-based event-triggering rule. To do so, we monitor the evolution of a data-based Lyapunov function along the solution. When this Lyapunov function does not satisfy a designed desirable condition, an episode is triggered to update the controller gain and the corresponding Lyapunov function using the last collected data. The resulting closed-loop dynamics hence exhibits both physical jumps, due to the system dynamics, and episodic jumps, which naturally leads to a hybrid discrete-time system. We leverage the inherent robustness of the controller and provide general conditions under which various stability notions can be established for the system. Two notable cases where these conditions are satisfied are treated, and numerical results illustrating the relevance of the approach are discussed.

Title: An LSTM Feature Imitation Network for Hand Movement Recognition from sEMG Signals
Authors: Chuheng Wu, S. Farokh Atashzar, Mohammad M. Ghassemi, Tuka Alhanai
Abstract: Surface Electromyography (sEMG) is a non-invasive signal that is used in the recognition of hand movement patterns, the diagnosis of diseases, and the robust control of prostheses. Despite the remarkable success of recent end-to-end Deep Learning approaches, they are still limited by the need for large amounts of labeled data. To alleviate the requirement for big data, we propose utilizing a feature-imitating network (FIN) for closed-form temporal feature learning over a 300ms signal window on Ninapro DB2, and applying it to the task of 17 hand movement recognition. We implement a lightweight LSTM-FIN network to imitate four standard temporal features (entropy, root mean square, variance, simple square integral). We observed that the LSTM-FIN network can achieve up to 99\% R2 accuracy in feature reconstruction and 80\% accuracy in hand movement recognition. Our results also showed that the model can be robustly applied for both within- and cross-subject movement recognition, as well as simulated low-latency environments. Overall, our work demonstrates the potential of the FIN modeling paradigm in data-scarce scenarios for sEMG signal processing.

Title: Multi-Scale Accent Modeling and Disentangling for Multi-Speaker Multi-Accent Text-to-Speech Synthesis
Authors: Xuehao Zhou, Mingyang Zhang, Yi Zhou, Zhizheng Wu, Haizhou Li
Abstract: Generating speech across different accents while preserving speaker identity is crucial for various real-world applications. However, accurately and independently modeling both speaker and accent characteristics in text-to-speech (TTS) systems is challenging due to the complex variations of accents and the inherent entanglement between speaker and accent identities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for multi-speaker multi-accent TTS synthesis that aims to synthesize speech for multiple speakers, each with various accents. Our approach employs a multi-scale accent modeling strategy to address accent variations on different levels. Specifically, we introduce both global (utterance level) and local (phoneme level) accent modeling to capture overall accent characteristics within an utterance and fine-grained accent variations across phonemes, respectively. To enable independent control of speakers and accents, we use the speaker embedding to represent speaker identity and achieve speaker-independent accent control through speaker disentanglement within the multi-scale accent modeling. Additionally, we present a local accent prediction model that enables our system to generate accented speech directly from phoneme inputs. We conduct extensive experiments on an English accented speech corpus. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system outperforms baseline systems in terms of speech quality and accent rendering for generating multi-speaker multi-accent speech. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of different components in our proposed system.

Title: Neural Network-Based IRS Assisted NLoS DoA Estimation
Authors: Yasin Azhdari, Mahmoud Farhang
Abstract: Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) estimation in challenging Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) environments is crucial for various wireless applications. This paper presents a novel neural network architecture to address this challenge using an Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS). The key innovation is the introduction of a dedicated, learnable Neural Network (NN)-based IRS layer integrated within a carefully designed network structure. Unlike conventional neural network layers, this specialized layer incorporates sinusoidal weight constraints, where the phase arguments of these sinusoids are learned during training to directly emulate the phase shifts of the IRS elements. This allows the network to autonomously optimize the IRS configuration for enhanced DoA estimation, eliminating the need for separate IRS control algorithms. We adapt standard backpropagation to accommodate these constraints, ensuring effective training. Numerical simulations, conducted under various conditions and noise levels, demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared to traditional methods, highlighting its potential for significantly improved DoA estimation accuracy in complex IRS-assisted wireless systems.

Title: Multi-modal Evidential Fusion Network for Trustworthy PET/CT Tumor Segmentation
Authors: Yuxuan Qi, Li Lin, Jiajun Wang, Bin Zhang, Jingya Zhang
Abstract: Accurate tumor segmentation in PET/CT images is crucial for computer-aided cancer diagnosis and treatment. The primary challenge lies in effectively integrating the complementary information from PET and CT images. In clinical settings, the quality of PET and CT images often varies significantly, leading to uncertainty in the modality information extracted by networks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Multi-modal Evidential Fusion Network (MEFN), which consists of two core stages: Cross-Modal Feature Learning (CFL) and Multi-modal Trustworthy Fusion (MTF). The CFL stage aligns features across different modalities and learns more robust feature representations, thereby alleviating the negative effects of domain gap. The MTF stage utilizes mutual attention mechanisms and an uncertainty calibrator to fuse modality features based on modality uncertainty and then fuse the segmentation results under the guidance of Dempster-Shafer Theory. Besides, a new uncertainty perceptual loss is introduced to force the model focusing on uncertain features and hence improve its ability to extract trusted modality information. Extensive comparative experiments are conducted on two publicly available PET/CT datasets to evaluate the performance of our proposed method whose results demonstrate that our MEFN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with improvements of 3.10% and 3.23% in DSC scores on the AutoPET dataset and the Hecktor dataset, respectively. More importantly, our model can provide radiologists with credible uncertainty of the segmentation results for their decision in accepting or rejecting the automatic segmentation results, which is particularly important for clinical applications. Our code will be available at this https URL.

Title: Real World Federated Learning with a Knowledge Distilled Transformer for Cardiac CT Imaging

Abstract: Federated learning is a renowned technique for utilizing decentralized data while preserving privacy. However, real-world applications often face challenges like partially labeled datasets, where only a few locations have certain expert annotations, leaving large portions of unlabeled data unused. Leveraging these could enhance transformer architectures ability in regimes with small and diversely annotated sets. We conduct the largest federated cardiac CT analysis to date (n=8,104) in a real-world setting across eight hospitals. Our two-step semi-supervised strategy distills knowledge from task-specific CNNs into a transformer. First, CNNs predict on unlabeled data per label type and then the transformer learns from these predictions with label-specific heads. This improves predictive accuracy and enables simultaneous learning of all partial labels across the federation, and outperforms UNet-based models in generalizability on downstream tasks. Code and model weights are made openly available for leveraging future cardiac CT analysis.

Title: Movable Antenna-Aided Secure Full-Duplex Multi-User Communications
Authors: Jingze Ding, Zijian Zhou, Bingli Jiao
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate physical layer security (PLS) for full-duplex (FD) multi-user systems. We consider a base station (BS) that operates in FD mode and transmits artificial noise (AN) to simultaneously protect uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) transmissions. Conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs) at the FD BS struggle to fully exploit spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) to improve signal reception and suppress interference. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel FD BS architecture equipped with multiple transmit and receive movable antennas (MAs). The MAs introduce the DoFs in antenna position optimization, which can improve the performance of secure communication systems. To serve users and counter the cooperative interception of multiple eavesdroppers (Eves), we formulate a sum of secrecy rates (SSR) maximization problem to jointly optimize the MA positions, the transmit, receive, and AN beamformers at the BS, and the UL powers. We propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, which decomposes the original problem into three sub-problems, to solve the challenging non-convex optimization problem with highly coupled variables. Specifically, we propose the multi-velocity particle swarm optimization (MVPSO), which is an improved version of the standard particle swarm optimization (PSO), to simultaneously optimize all MA positions. The transmit/AN beamformers and the UL powers are solved by successive convex approximation (SCA). The optimal receive beamformer is derived as a closed-form solution. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and the advantages of MAs over conventional FPAs in enhancing the security of FD multi-user systems.

Title: Electricity Market-Clearing With Extreme Events
Authors: Tomas Tapia, Zhirui Liang, Charalambos Konstantinou, Yury Dvorkin
Abstract: Extreme events jeopardize power network operations, causing beyond-design failures and massive supply interruptions. Existing market designs fail to internalize and systematically assess the risk of extreme and rare events. Efficiently maintaining the reliability of renewable-dominant power systems during extreme weather events requires co-optimizing system resources, while differentiating between large/rare and small/frequent deviations from forecast conditions. To address this gap in both research and practice, we propose managing the uncertainties associated with extreme weather events through an additional reserve service, termed extreme reserve. The procurement of extreme reserve is co-optimized with energy and regular reserve using a large deviation theory chance-constrained (LDT-CC) model, where LDT offers a mathematical framework to quantify the increased uncertainty during extreme events. To mitigate the high additional costs associated with reserve scheduling under the LDT-CC model, we also propose an LDT model based on weighted chance constraints (LDT-WCC). This model prepares the power system for extreme events at a lower cost, making it a less conservative alternative to the LDT-CC model. The proposed market design leads to a competitive equilibrium while ensuring cost recovery. Numerical experiments on an illustrative system and a modified 8-zone ISO New England system highlight the advantages of the proposed market design.

Title: An Econometric Analysis of Large Flexible Cryptocurrency-mining Consumers in Electricity Markets
Authors: Subir Majumder, Ignacio Aravena, Le Xie
Abstract: In recent years, power grids have seen a surge in large cryptocurrency mining firms, with individual consumption levels reaching 700MW. This study examines the behavior of these firms in Texas, focusing on how their consumption is influenced by cryptocurrency conversion rates, electricity prices, local weather, and other factors. We transform the skewed electricity consumption data of these firms, perform correlation analysis, and apply a seasonal autoregressive moving average model for analysis. Our findings reveal that, surprisingly, short-term mining electricity consumption is not directly correlated with cryptocurrency conversion rates. Instead, the primary influencers are the temperature and electricity prices. These firms also respond to avoid transmission and distribution network (T&D) charges - commonly referred to as four Coincident peak (4CP) charges - during the summer months. As the scale of these firms is likely to surge in future years, the developed electricity consumption model can be used to generate public, synthetic datasets to understand the overall impact on the power grid. The developed model could also lead to better pricing mechanisms to effectively use the flexibility of these resources towards improving power grid reliability.

Title: SSR-Speech: Towards Stable, Safe and Robust Zero-shot Text-based Speech Editing and Synthesis
Authors: Helin Wang, Meng Yu, Jiarui Hai, Chen Chen, Yuchen Hu, Rilin Chen, Najim Dehak, Dong Yu
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SSR-Speech, a neural codec autoregressive model designed for stable, safe, and robust zero-shot textbased speech editing and text-to-speech synthesis. SSR-Speech is built on a Transformer decoder and incorporates classifier-free guidance to enhance the stability of the generation process. A watermark Encodec is proposed to embed frame-level watermarks into the edited regions of the speech so that which parts were edited can be detected. In addition, the waveform reconstruction leverages the original unedited speech segments, providing superior recovery compared to the Encodec model.

Title: OCTAMamba: A State-Space Model Approach for Precision OCTA Vasculature Segmentation
Authors: Shun Zou, Zhuo Zhang, Guangwei Gao
Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) is a crucial imaging technique for visualizing retinal vasculature and diagnosing eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. However, precise segmentation of OCTA vasculature remains challenging due to the multi-scale vessel structures and noise from poor image quality and eye lesions. In this study, we proposed OCTAMamba, a novel U-shaped network based on the Mamba architecture, designed to segment vasculature in OCTA accurately. OCTAMamba integrates a Quad Stream Efficient Mining Embedding Module for local feature extraction, a Multi-Scale Dilated Asymmetric Convolution Module to capture multi-scale vasculature, and a Focused Feature Recalibration Module to filter noise and highlight target areas. Our method achieves efficient global modeling and local feature extraction while maintaining linear complexity, making it suitable for low-computation medical applications. Extensive experiments on the OCTA 3M, OCTA 6M, and ROSSA datasets demonstrated that OCTAMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing a new reference for efficient OCTA segmentation.

Title: SoloAudio: Target Sound Extraction with Language-oriented Audio Diffusion Transformer
Authors: Helin Wang, Jiarui Hai, Yen-Ju Lu, Karan Thakkar, Mounya Elhilali, Najim Dehak
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SoloAudio, a novel diffusion-based generative model for target sound extraction (TSE). Our approach trains latent diffusion models on audio, replacing the previous U-Net backbone with a skip-connected Transformer that operates on latent features. SoloAudio supports both audio-oriented and language-oriented TSE by utilizing a CLAP model as the feature extractor for target sounds. Furthermore, SoloAudio leverages synthetic audio generated by state-of-the-art text-to-audio models for training, demonstrating strong generalization to out-of-domain data and unseen sound events. We evaluate this approach on the FSD Kaggle 2018 mixture dataset and real data from AudioSet, where SoloAudio achieves the state-of-the-art results on both in-domain and out-of-domain data, and exhibits impressive zero-shot and few-shot capabilities. Source code and demos are released.

Title: Transfer Learning and Double U-Net Empowered Wave Propagation Model in Complex Indoor Environment
Authors: Ziheng Fu, Swagato Mukherjee, Michael T. Lanagan, Prasenjit Mitra, Tarun Chawla, Ram M. Narayanan
Abstract: A Machine Learning (ML) network based on transfer learning and transformer networks is applied to wave propagation models for complex indoor settings. This network is designed to predict signal propagation in environments with a variety of objects, effectively simulating the diverse range of furniture typically found in indoor spaces. We propose Attention U-Net with Efficient Networks as the backbone, to process images encoded with the essential information of the indoor environment. The indoor environment is defined by its fundamental structure, such as the arrangement of walls, windows, and doorways, alongside varying configurations of furniture placement. An innovative algorithm is introduced to generate a 3D environment from a 2D floorplan, which is crucial for efficient collection of data for training. The model is evaluated by comparing the predicted signal coverage map with ray tracing (RT) simulations. The prediction results show a root mean square error of less than 6 dB across all tested scenarios, with significant improvements observed when using a Double U-Net structure compared to a single U-Net model.

Title: UniMo: Universal Motion Correction For Medical Images without Network Retraining
Authors: Jian Wang, Razieh Faghihpirayesh, Danny Joca, Polina Golland, Ali Gholipour
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a Universal Motion Correction (UniMo) framework, leveraging deep neural networks to tackle the challenges of motion correction across diverse imaging modalities. Our approach employs advanced neural network architectures with equivariant filters, overcoming the limitations of current models that require iterative inference or retraining for new image modalities. UniMo enables one-time training on a single modality while maintaining high stability and adaptability for inference across multiple unseen image modalities. We developed a joint learning framework that integrates multimodal knowledge from both shape and images that faithfully improve motion correction accuracy despite image appearance variations. UniMo features a geometric deformation augmenter that enhances the robustness of global motion correction by addressing any local deformations whether they are caused by object deformations or geometric distortions, and also generates augmented data to improve the training process. Our experimental results, conducted on various datasets with four different image modalities, demonstrate that UniMo surpasses existing motion correction methods in terms of accuracy. By offering a comprehensive solution to motion correction, UniMo marks a significant advancement in medical imaging, especially in challenging applications with wide ranges of motion, such as fetal imaging.

Title: Guided Speaker Embedding
Authors: Shota Horiguchi, Takafumi Moriya, Atsushi Ando, Takanori Ashihara, Hiroshi Sato, Naohiro Tawara, Marc Delcroix
Abstract: This paper proposes a guided speaker embedding extraction system, which extracts speaker embeddings of the target speaker using speech activities of target and interference speakers as clues. Several methods for long-form overlapped multi-speaker audio processing are typically two-staged: i) segment-level processing and ii) inter-segment speaker matching. Speaker embeddings are often used for the latter purpose. Typical speaker embedding extraction approaches only use single-speaker intervals to avoid corrupting the embeddings with speech from interference speakers. However, this often makes speaker embeddings impossible to extract because sufficiently long non-overlapping intervals are not always available. In this paper, we propose using speaker activities as clues to extract the embedding of the speaker-of-interest directly from overlapping speech. Specifically, we concatenate the activity of target and non-target speakers to acoustic features before being fed to the model. We also condition the attention weights used for pooling so that the attention weights of the intervals in which the target speaker is inactive are zero. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in speaker verification and speaker diarization.

Title: Can Large Audio-Language Models Truly Hear? Tackling Hallucinations with Multi-Task Assessment and Stepwise Audio Reasoning
Authors: Chun-Yi Kuan, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: Recent advancements in large audio-language models (LALMs) have shown impressive capabilities in understanding and reasoning about audio and speech information. However, these models still face challenges, including hallucinating non-existent sound events, misidentifying the order of sound events, and incorrectly attributing sound sources, which undermine their reliability and real-world application. To systematically evaluate these issues, we propose three distinct tasks: object existence, temporal order, and object attribute within audio. These tasks assess the models' comprehension of critical audio information aspects. Our experimental results reveal limitations in these fundamental tasks, underscoring the need for better models in recognizing specific sound events, determining event sequences, and identifying sound sources. To improve performance in these areas, we introduce a multi-turn chain-of-thought approach, which demonstrates significantly improved model performance across the proposed tasks.

Title: CJST: CTC Compressor based Joint Speech and Text Training for Decoder-Only ASR
Authors: Wei Zhou, Junteng Jia, Leda Sari, Jay Mahadeokar, Ozlem Kalinli
Abstract: CTC compressor can be an effective approach to integrate audio encoders to decoder-only models, which has gained growing interest for different speech applications. In this work, we propose a novel CTC compressor based joint speech and text training (CJST) framework for decoder-only ASR. CJST matches speech and text modalities from both directions by exploring a simple modality adaptor and several features of the CTC compressor, including sequence compression, on-the-fly forced peaky alignment and CTC class embeddings. Experimental results on the Librispeech and TED-LIUM2 corpora show that the proposed CJST achieves an effective text injection without the need of duration handling, leading to the best performance for both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios. We also provide a comprehensive study on CTC compressor, covering various compression modes, edge case handling and behavior under both clean and noisy data conditions, which reveals the most robust setting to use CTC compressor for decoder-only models.

Title: Radiance Field Delta Video Compression in Edge-Enabled Vehicular Metaverse
Authors: Matúš Dopiriak, Eugen Šlapak, Juraj Gazda, Devendra S. Gurjar, Mohammad Abdullah Al Faruque, Marco Levorato
Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offload computationally intensive tasks to multi-access edge computing (MEC) servers via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, enabling applications within the vehicular metaverse, which transforms physical environment into the digital space enabling advanced analysis or predictive modeling. A core challenge is physical-to-virtual (P2V) synchronization through digital twins (DTs), reliant on MEC networks and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). To address this, we introduce radiance field (RF) delta video compression (RFDVC), which uses RF-encoder and RF-decoder architecture using distributed RFs as DTs storing photorealistic 3D urban scenes in compressed form. This method extracts differences between CAV-frame capturing actual traffic and RF-frame capturing empty scene from the same camera pose in batches encoded and transmitted over the MEC network. Experiments show data savings up to 71% against H.264 codec and 44% against H.265 codec under different conditions as lighting changes, and rain. RFDVC also demonstrates resilience to transmission errors, achieving up to +0.29 structural similarity index measure (SSIM) improvement at block error rate (BLER) = 0.35 in non-rainy and +0.25 at BLER = 0.2 in rainy conditions, ensuring superior visual quality compared to standard video coding (VC) methods across various conditions.

Title: AI Flow at the Network Edge
Authors: Jiawei Shao, Xuelong Li
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants have led to remarkable progress across various domains, demonstrating impressive capabilities and unprecedented potential. In the era of ubiquitous connectivity, leveraging communication networks to distribute intelligence is a transformative concept, envisioning AI-powered services accessible at the network edge. However, pushing large models from the cloud to resource-constrained environments faces critical challenges. Model inference on low-end devices leads to excessive latency and performance bottlenecks, while raw data transmission over limited bandwidth networks causes high communication overhead. This article presents AI Flow, a framework that streamlines the inference process by jointly leveraging the heterogeneous resources available across devices, edge nodes, and cloud servers, making intelligence flow across networks. To facilitate cooperation among multiple computational nodes, the proposed framework explores a paradigm shift in the design of communication network systems from transmitting information flow to intelligence flow, where the goal of communications is task-oriented and folded into the inference process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through an image captioning use case, showcasing the ability to reduce response latency while maintaining high-quality captions. This article serves as a position paper for identifying the motivation, challenges, and principles of AI Flow.

Title: Achieving Dispatchability in Data Centers: Carbon and Cost-Aware Sizing of Energy Storage and Local Photovoltaic Generation
Authors: Enea Figini, Mario Paolone
Abstract: Data centers are large electricity consumers due to the high consumption needs of servers and their cooling systems. Given the current crypto-currency and artificial intelligence trends, the data center electricity demand is bound to grow significantly. With the electricity sector being responsible for a large share of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it is important to lower the carbon footprint of data centers to meet GHG emissions targets set by international agreements. Moreover, uncontrolled integration of data centers in power distribution grids contributes to increasing the stochasticity of the power system demand, thus increasing the need for capacity reserves, which leads to economic and environmental inefficiencies in the power grid operation. This work provides a method to size a PhotoVoltaic (PV) system and an Energy Storage System (ESS) for an existing data center looking to reduce both its carbon footprint and demand stochasticity via dispatching. The proposed scenario-based optimization framework allows to size the ESS and the PV system to minimize the expected operational and capital costs, along with the carbon footprint of the data center complex. The life cycle assessment of the resources, as well as the dynamic carbon emissions of the upstream power distribution grid, are accounted for while computing the day-ahead planning of the data center aggregated demand and PV generation. Case studies in different Swiss cantons and regions of Germany emphasize the need for location-aware sizing processes since the obtained optimal solutions strongly depend on the local electricity carbon footprint, cost and on the local irradiance conditions. Some regions show potential in carbon footprint reduction, while other regions do not.

Title: Speech Retrieval-Augmented Generation without Automatic Speech Recognition
Authors: Do June Min, Karel Mundnich, Andy Lapastora, Erfan Soltanmohammadi, Srikanth Ronanki, Kyu Han
Abstract: One common approach for question answering over speech data is to first transcribe speech using automatic speech recognition (ASR) and then employ text-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) on the transcriptions. While this cascaded pipeline has proven effective in many practical settings, ASR errors can propagate to the retrieval and generation steps. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SpeechRAG, a novel framework designed for open-question answering over spoken data. Our proposed approach fine-tunes a pre-trained speech encoder into a speech adapter fed into a frozen large language model (LLM)--based retrieval model. By aligning the embedding spaces of text and speech, our speech retriever directly retrieves audio passages from text-based queries, leveraging the retrieval capacity of the frozen text retriever. Our retrieval experiments on spoken question answering datasets show that direct speech retrieval does not degrade over the text-based baseline, and outperforms the cascaded systems using ASR. For generation, we use a speech language model (SLM) as a generator, conditioned on audio passages rather than transcripts. Without fine-tuning of the SLM, this approach outperforms cascaded text-based models when there is high WER in the transcripts.

Title: FOGNA: An effective Sum-Difference Co-Array Design Based on Fourth-Order Cumulants
Authors: Si Wang, Guoqiang Xiao
Abstract: Array structures based on the fourth-order difference co-array (FODCA) provide more degrees of freedom (DOF). However, since the growth of DOF is limited by a single case of fourth-order cumulant in FODCA, this paper aims to design a sparse linear array (SLA) with higher DOF via exploring different cases of fourth-order cumulants. This paper presents a mathematical framework based on fourth-order cumulant to devise a fourth-order extend co-array (FOECA), which is equivalent to FODCA. A novel SLA, namely fourth-order generalized nested array (FOGNA), is proposed based on FOECA to provide closed-form expressions for the sensor locations and enhance DOF to resolve more signal sources in direction of arrival (DOA) estimation. FOGNA is consisted of three subarrays, where the first is a concatenated nested array and the other two subarrays are SLA with big inter-spacing between sensors. When the total physical sensors of FOGNA are given, the number of sensors in each subarray is determined by the designed method, which can obtain the maximum DOF under the proposed array structure and derive closed-form expressions for the sensor locations of FOGNA. The proposed array structure not only achieves higher DOF than those of existing FODCAs but also reduces mutual coupling effects. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify the superiority of FOGNA on DOA estimation performance and enhanced DOF over other existing FODCAs.

Title: SegKAN: High-Resolution Medical Image Segmentation with Long-Distance Dependencies
Authors: Shengbo Tan, Rundong Xue, Shipeng Luo, Zeyu Zhang, Xinran Wang, Lei Zhang, Daji Ergu, Zhang Yi, Yang Zhao, Ying Cai
Abstract: Hepatic vessels in computed tomography scans often suffer from image fragmentation and noise interference, making it difficult to maintain vessel integrity and posing significant challenges for vessel segmentation. To address this issue, we propose an innovative model: SegKAN. First, we improve the conventional embedding module by adopting a novel convolutional network structure for image embedding, which smooths out image noise and prevents issues such as gradient explosion in subsequent stages. Next, we transform the spatial relationships between Patch blocks into temporal relationships to solve the problem of capturing positional relationships between Patch blocks in traditional Vision Transformer models. We conducted experiments on a Hepatic vessel dataset, and compared to the existing state-of-the-art model, the Dice score improved by 1.78%. These results demonstrate that the proposed new structure effectively enhances the segmentation performance of high-resolution extended objects. Code will be available at this https URL

Title: Ultra-Wideband Double-Directional Channel Measurements and Statistical Modeling in Urban Microcellular Environments for the Upper-Midband/FR3
Authors: Naveed A. Abbasi, Kelvin Arana, Siddhant Singh, Atulya Bist, Vikram Vasudevan, Tathagat Pal, Jorge Gomez-Ponce, Young-Han Nam, Charlie Zhang, Andreas F. Molisch
Abstract: The upper midband, designated as Frequency Range 3 (FR3), is increasingly critical for the next-generation of wireless networks. Channel propagation measurements and their statistical analysis are essential first steps towards this direction. This paper presents a comprehensive ultra-wideband (UWB) double-directional channel measurement campaign in a large portion of FR3 (6-14 GHz) for urban microcellular environments. We analyze over 25,000 directional power delay profiles and providing key insights into line-of-sight (LoS) and obstructed line-of-sight (OLoS) conditions. This is followed by statistical modeling of path loss, shadowing, delay spread and angular spread. As the first UWB double-directional measurement campaign in this frequency range, this work offers critical insights for spectrum allocation, channel modeling, and the design of advanced communication systems, paving the way for further exploration of FR3.

Title: Geometric Tracking Control of Omnidirectional Multirotors for Aggressive Maneuvers
Authors: Hyungyu Lee, Sheng Cheng, Zhuohuan Wu, Jaeyoung Lim, Roland Siegwart, Naira Hovakimyan
Abstract: An omnidirectional multirotor has the maneuverability of decoupled translational and rotational motions, superseding the traditional multirotors' motion capability. Such maneuverability is achieved due to the ability of the omnidirectional multirotor to frequently alter the thrust amplitude and direction. In doing so, the rotors' settling time, which is induced by inherent rotor dynamics, significantly affects the omnidirectional multirotor's tracking performance, especially in aggressive flights. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel tracking controller that takes the rotor dynamics into account and does not require additional rotor state measurement. This is achieved by integrating a linear rotor dynamics model into the vehicle's equations of motion and designing a PD controller to compensate for the effects introduced by rotor dynamics. We prove that the proposed controller yields almost global exponential stability. The proposed controller is validated in experiments, where we demonstrate significantly improved tracking performance in multiple aggressive maneuvers compared with a baseline geometric PD controller.

Title: Reinforcement Learning for Control of Evolutionary and Ecological Processes
Authors: Bryce Allen Bagley, Navin Khoshnan, Claudia K Petritsch
Abstract: As Evolutionary Dynamics moves from the realm of theory into application, algorithms are needed to move beyond simple models. Yet few such methods exist in the literature. Ecological and physiological factors are known to be central to evolution in realistic contexts, but accounting for them generally renders problems intractable to existing methods. We introduce a formulation of evolutionary games which accounts for ecology and physiology by modeling both as computations and use this to analyze the problem of directed evolution via methods from Reinforcement Learning. This combination enables us to develop first-of-their-kind results on the algorithmic problem of learning to control an evolving population of cells. We prove a complexity bound on eco-evolutionary control in situations with limited prior knowledge of cellular physiology or ecology, give the first results on the most general version of the mathematical problem of directed evolution, and establish a new link between AI and biology.

Title: Realistic Noise Synthesis with Diffusion Models
Authors: Qi Wu, Mingyan Han, Ting Jiang, Chengzhi Jiang, Jinting Luo, Man Jiang, Haoqiang Fan, Shuaicheng Liu
Abstract: Deep denoising models require extensive real-world training data, which is challenging to acquire. Current noise synthesis techniques struggle to accurately model complex noise distributions. We propose a novel Realistic Noise Synthesis Diffusor (RNSD) method using diffusion models to address these challenges. By encoding camera settings into a time-aware camera-conditioned affine modulation (TCCAM), RNSD generates more realistic noise distributions under various camera conditions. Additionally, RNSD integrates a multi-scale content-aware module (MCAM), enabling the generation of structured noise with spatial correlations across multiple frequencies. We also introduce Deep Image Prior Sampling (DIPS), a learnable sampling sequence based on depth image prior, which significantly accelerates the sampling process while maintaining the high quality of synthesized noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RNSD method significantly outperforms existing techniques in synthesizing realistic noise under multiple metrics and improving image denoising performance.

Title: Dual Degradation-Inspired Deep Unfolding Network for Low-Light Image Enhancement
Authors: Huake Wang, Xingsong Hou, Chengcu Liu, Kaibing Zhang, Xiangyong Cao, Xueming Qian
Abstract: Although low-light image enhancement has achieved great stride based on deep enhancement models, most of them mainly stress on enhancement performance via an elaborated black-box network and rarely explore the physical significance of enhancement models. Towards this issue, we propose a Dual degrAdation-inSpired deep Unfolding network, termed DASUNet, for low-light image enhancement. Specifically, we construct a dual degradation model (DDM) to explicitly simulate the deterioration mechanism of low-light images. It learns two distinct image priors via considering degradation specificity between luminance and chrominance spaces. To make the proposed scheme tractable, we design an alternating optimization solution to solve the proposed DDM. Further, the designed solution is unfolded into a specified deep network, imitating the iteration updating rules, to form DASUNet. Based on different specificity in two spaces, we design two customized Transformer block to model different priors. Additionally, a space aggregation module (SAM) is presented to boost the interaction of two degradation models. Extensive experiments on multiple popular low-light image datasets validate the effectiveness of DASUNet compared to canonical state-of-the-art low-light image enhancement methods. Our source code and pretrained model will be publicly available.

Title: Passive Non-Line-of-Sight Imaging with Light Transport Modulation
Authors: Jiarui Zhang, Ruixu Geng, Xiaolong Du, Yan Chen, Houqiang Li, Yang Hu
Abstract: Passive non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging has witnessed rapid development in recent years, due to its ability to image objects that are out of sight. The light transport condition plays an important role in this task since changing the conditions will lead to different imaging models. Existing learning-based NLOS methods usually train independent models for different light transport conditions, which is computationally inefficient and impairs the practicality of the models. In this work, we propose NLOS-LTM, a novel passive NLOS imaging method that effectively handles multiple light transport conditions with a single network. We achieve this by inferring a latent light transport representation from the projection image and using this representation to modulate the network that reconstructs the hidden image from the projection image. We train a light transport encoder together with a vector quantizer to obtain the light transport representation. To further regulate this representation, we jointly learn both the reconstruction network and the reprojection network during training. A set of light transport modulation blocks is used to modulate the two jointly trained networks in a multi-scale way. Extensive experiments on a large-scale passive NLOS dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. The code is available at this https URL.

Title: Neural variational Data Assimilation with Uncertainty Quantification using SPDE priors
Authors: Maxime Beauchamp, Ronan Fablet, Simon Benaichouche, Pierre Tandeo, Nicolas Desassis, Bertrand Chapron
Abstract: The spatio-temporal interpolation of large geophysical datasets has historically been addressed by Optimal Interpolation (OI) and more sophisticated equation-based or data-driven Data Assimilation (DA) techniques. Recent advances in the deep learning community enables to address the interpolation problem through a neural architecture incorporating a variational data assimilation framework. The reconstruction task is seen as a joint learning problem of the prior involved in the variational inner cost, seen as a projection operator of the state, and the gradient-based minimization of the latter. Both prior models and solvers are stated as neural networks with automatic differentiation which can be trained by minimizing a loss function, typically the mean squared error between some ground truth and the reconstruction. Such a strategy turns out to be very efficient to improve the mean state estimation, but still needs complementary developments to quantify its related uncertainty. In this work, we use the theory of Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) and Gaussian Processes (GP) to estimate both space-and time-varying covariance of the state. Our neural variational scheme is modified to embed an augmented state formulation with both state and SPDE parametrization to estimate. We demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework on a spatio-temporal GP driven by diffusion-based anisotropies and on realistic Sea Surface Height (SSH) datasets. We show how our solution reaches the OI baseline in the Gaussian case. For nonlinear dynamics, as almost always stated in DA, our solution outperforms OI, while allowing for fast and interpretable online parameter estimation.

Title: Calibrating Bayesian Learning via Regularization, Confidence Minimization, and Selective Inference
Authors: Jiayi Huang, Sangwoo Park, Osvaldo Simeone
Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) models in fields such as engineering is limited by the known difficulty of quantifying the reliability of an AI's decision. A well-calibrated AI model must correctly report its accuracy on in-distribution (ID) inputs, while also enabling the detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. A conventional approach to improve calibration is the application of Bayesian ensembling. However, owing to computational limitations and model misspecification, practical ensembling strategies do not necessarily enhance calibration. This paper proposes an extension of variational inference (VI)-based Bayesian learning that integrates calibration regularization for improved ID performance, confidence minimization for OOD detection, and selective calibration to ensure a synergistic use of calibration regularization and confidence minimization. The scheme is constructed successively by first introducing calibration-regularized Bayesian learning (CBNN), then incorporating out-of-distribution confidence minimization (OCM) to yield CBNN-OCM, and finally integrating also selective calibration to produce selective CBNN-OCM (SCBNN-OCM). Selective calibration rejects inputs for which the calibration performance is expected to be insufficient. Numerical results illustrate the trade-offs between ID accuracy, ID calibration, and OOD calibration attained by both frequentist and Bayesian learning methods. Among the main conclusions, SCBNN-OCM is seen to achieve best ID and OOD performance as compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches at the cost of rejecting a sufficiently large number of inputs.

Title: Over-the-Air Fusion of Sparse Spatial Features for Integrated Sensing and Edge AI over Broadband Channels
Authors: Zhiyan Liu, Qiao Lan, Kaibin Huang
Abstract: The 6G mobile networks feature two new usage scenarios -- distributed sensing and edge artificial intelligence (AI). Their natural integration, termed integrated sensing and edge AI (ISEA), promises to create a platform that enables intelligent environment perception for wide-ranging applications. A basic operation in ISEA is for a fusion center to acquire and fuse features of spatial sensing data distributed at many edge devices (known as agents), which is confronted by a communication bottleneck due to multiple access over hostile wireless channels. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, called Spatial Over-the-Air Fusion (Spatial AirFusion), which exploits radio waveform superposition to aggregate spatially sparse features over the air and thereby enables simultaneous access. The framework supports simultaneous aggregation over multiple voxels, which partition the 3D sensing region, and across multiple subcarriers. It exploits both spatial feature sparsity with channel diversity to pair voxel-level aggregation tasks and subcarriers to maximize the minimum receive signal-to-noise ratio among voxels. Optimally solving the resultant mixed-integer problem of Voxel-Carrier Pairing and Power Allocation (VoCa-PPA) is a focus of this work. The proposed approach hinges on derivations of optimal power allocation as a closed-form function of voxel-carrier pairing and a useful property of VoCa-PPA that allows dramatic solution space reduction. Both a low-complexity greedy algorithm and an optimal tree-search algorithm are then designed for VoCa-PPA. The latter is accelerated with a customised compact search tree, node pruning and agent ordering. Extensive simulations using real datasets demonstrate that Spatial AirFusion significantly reduces computation errors and improves sensing accuracy compared with conventional over-the-air computation without awareness of spatial sparsity.

Title: NeurTV: Total Variation on the Neural Domain
Authors: Yisi Luo, Xile Zhao, Kai Ye, Deyu Meng
Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed the success of total variation (TV) for many imaging applications. However, traditional TV is defined on the original pixel domain, which limits its potential. In this work, we suggest a new TV regularization defined on the neural domain. Concretely, the discrete data is implicitly and continuously represented by a deep neural network (DNN), and we use the derivatives of DNN outputs w.r.t. input coordinates to capture local correlations of data. As compared with classical TV on the original domain, the proposed TV on the neural domain (termed NeurTV) enjoys the following advantages. First, NeurTV is free of discretization error induced by the discrete difference operator. Second, NeurTV is not limited to meshgrid but is suitable for both meshgrid and non-meshgrid data. Third, NeurTV can more exactly capture local correlations across data for any direction and any order of derivatives attributed to the implicit and continuous nature of neural domain. We theoretically reinterpret NeurTV under the variational approximation framework, which allows us to build the connection between NeurTV and classical TV and inspires us to develop variants (e.g., space-variant NeurTV). Extensive numerical experiments with meshgrid data (e.g., color and hyperspectral images) and non-meshgrid data (e.g., point clouds and spatial transcriptomics) showcase the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Authors: Yi Yuan, Dongya Jia, Xiaobin Zhuang, Yuanzhe Chen, Zhengxi Liu, Zhuo Chen, Yuping Wang, Yuxuan Wang, Xubo Liu, Xiyuan Kang, Mark D. Plumbley, Wenwu Wang
Abstract: Generative models have shown significant achievements in audio generation tasks. However, existing models struggle with complex and detailed prompts, leading to potential performance degradation. We hypothesize that this problem stems from the simplicity and scarcity of the training data. This work aims to create a large-scale audio dataset with rich captions for improving audio generation models. We first develop an automated pipeline to generate detailed captions by transforming predicted visual captions, audio captions, and tagging labels into comprehensive descriptions using a Large Language Model (LLM). The resulting dataset, Sound-VECaps, comprises 1.66M high-quality audio-caption pairs with enriched details including audio event orders, occurred places and environment information. We then demonstrate that training the text-to-audio generation models with Sound-VECaps significantly improves the performance on complex prompts. Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies of the models on several downstream audio-language tasks, showing the potential of Sound-VECaps in advancing audio-text representation learning. Our dataset and models are available online from here this https URL.

Title: Personalized Lip Reading: Adapting to Your Unique Lip Movements with Vision and Language
Authors: Jeong Hun Yeo, Chae Won Kim, Hyunjun Kim, Hyeongseop Rha, Seunghee Han, Wen-Huang Cheng, Yong Man Ro
Abstract: Lip reading aims to predict spoken language by analyzing lip movements. Despite advancements in lip reading technologies, performance degrades when models are applied to unseen speakers due to their sensitivity to variations in visual information such as lip appearances. To address this challenge, speaker adaptive lip reading technologies have advanced by focusing on effectively adapting a lip reading model to target speakers in the visual modality. However, the effectiveness of adapting language information, such as vocabulary choice, of the target speaker has not been explored in previous works. Additionally, existing datasets for speaker adaptation have limited vocabulary sizes and pose variations, which restrict the validation of previous speaker-adaptive methods in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a novel speaker-adaptive lip reading method that adapts a pre-trained model to target speakers at both vision and language levels. Specifically, we integrate prompt tuning and the LoRA approach, applying them to a pre-trained lip reading model to effectively adapt the model to target speakers. Furthermore, to validate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios, we introduce a new dataset, VoxLRS-SA, derived from VoxCeleb2 and LRS3. It contains a vocabulary of approximately 100K words, offers diverse pose variations, and enables the validation of adaptation methods in the wild, sentence-level lip reading for the first time in English. Through various experiments, we demonstrate that the existing speaker-adaptive method also improves performance in the wild at the sentence level. Moreover, we show that the proposed method achieves larger improvements compared to the previous works.

Title: Retinex-RAWMamba: Bridging Demosaicing and Denoising for Low-Light RAW Image Enhancement
Authors: Xianmin Chen, Peiliang Huang, Xiaoxu Feng, Dingwen Zhang, Longfei Han, Junwei Han
Abstract: Low-light image enhancement, particularly in cross-domain tasks such as mapping from the raw domain to the sRGB domain, remains a significant challenge. Many deep learning-based methods have been developed to address this issue and have shown promising results in recent years. However, single-stage methods, which attempt to unify the complex mapping across both domains, leading to limited denoising performance. In contrast, two-stage approaches typically decompose a raw image with color filter arrays (CFA) into a four-channel RGGB format before feeding it into a neural network. However, this strategy overlooks the critical role of demosaicing within the Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipeline, leading to color distortions under varying lighting conditions, especially in low-light scenarios. To address these issues, we design a novel Mamba scanning mechanism, called RAWMamba, to effectively handle raw images with different CFAs. Furthermore, we present a Retinex Decomposition Module (RDM) grounded in Retinex prior, which decouples illumination from reflectance to facilitate more effective denoising and automatic non-linear exposure correction. By bridging demosaicing and denoising, better raw image enhancement is achieved. Experimental evaluations conducted on public datasets SID and MCR demonstrate that our proposed RAWMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on cross-domain mapping.

Title: FlowSep: Language-Queried Sound Separation with Rectified Flow Matching
Authors: Yi Yuan, Xubo Liu, Haohe Liu, Mark D. Plumbley, Wenwu Wang
Abstract: Language-queried audio source separation (LASS) focuses on separating sounds using textual descriptions of the desired sources. Current methods mainly use discriminative approaches, such as time-frequency masking, to separate target sounds and minimize interference from other sources. However, these models face challenges when separating overlapping soundtracks, which may lead to artifacts such as spectral holes or incomplete separation. Rectified flow matching (RFM), a generative model that establishes linear relations between the distribution of data and noise, offers superior theoretical properties and simplicity, but has not yet been explored in sound separation. In this work, we introduce FlowSep, a new generative model based on RFM for LASS tasks. FlowSep learns linear flow trajectories from noise to target source features within the variational autoencoder (VAE) latent space. During inference, the RFM-generated latent features are reconstructed into a mel-spectrogram via the pre-trained VAE decoder, followed by a pre-trained vocoder to synthesize the waveform. Trained on 1,680 hours of audio data, FlowSep outperforms the state-of-the-art models across multiple benchmarks, as evaluated with subjective and objective metrics. Additionally, our results show that FlowSep surpasses a diffusion-based LASS model in both separation quality and inference efficiency, highlighting its strong potential for audio source separation tasks.

Title: Fitted Q-Iteration via Max-Plus-Linear Approximation
Authors: Y. Liu, M. A. S. Kolarijani
Abstract: In this study, we consider the application of max-plus-linear approximators for Q-function in offline reinforcement learning of discounted Markov decision processes. In particular, we incorporate these approximators to propose novel fitted Q-iteration (FQI) algorithms with provable convergence. Exploiting the compatibility of the Bellman operator with max-plus operations, we show that the max-plus-linear regression within each iteration of the proposed FQI algorithm reduces to simple max-plus matrix-vector multiplications. We also consider the variational implementation of the proposed algorithm which leads to a per-iteration complexity that is independent of the number of samples.

Title: M2R-Whisper: Multi-stage and Multi-scale Retrieval Augmentation for Enhancing Whisper
Authors: Jiaming Zhou, Shiwan Zhao, Jiabei He, Hui Wang, Wenjia Zeng, Yong Chen, Haoqin Sun, Aobo Kong, Yong Qin
Abstract: State-of-the-art models like OpenAI's Whisper exhibit strong performance in multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR), but they still face challenges in accurately recognizing diverse subdialects. In this paper, we propose M2R-whisper, a novel multi-stage and multi-scale retrieval augmentation approach designed to enhance ASR performance in low-resource settings. Building on the principles of in-context learning (ICL) and retrieval-augmented techniques, our method employs sentence-level ICL in the pre-processing stage to harness contextual information, while integrating token-level k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) retrieval as a post-processing step to further refine the final output distribution. By synergistically combining sentence-level and token-level retrieval strategies, M2R-whisper effectively mitigates various types of recognition errors. Experiments conducted on Mandarin and subdialect datasets, including AISHELL-1 and KeSpeech, demonstrate substantial improvements in ASR accuracy, all achieved without any parameter updates.

Title: Distributed Thompson sampling under constrained communication
Authors: Saba Zerefa, Zhaolin Ren, Haitong Ma, Na Li
Abstract: In Bayesian optimization, a black-box function is maximized via the use of a surrogate model. We apply distributed Thompson sampling, using a Gaussian process as a surrogate model, to approach the multi-agent Bayesian optimization problem. In our distributed Thompson sampling implementation, each agent receives sampled points from neighbors, where the communication network is encoded in a graph; each agent utilizes their own Gaussian process to model the objective function. We demonstrate theoretical bounds on Bayesian average regret and Bayesian simple regret, where the bound depends on the structure of the communication graph. Unlike in batch Bayesian optimization, this bound is applicable in cases where the communication graph amongst agents is constrained. When compared to sequential single-agent Thompson sampling, our bound guarantees faster convergence with respect to time as long as the communication graph is connected. We confirm the efficacy of our algorithm with numerical simulations on traditional optimization test functions, demonstrating the significance of graph connectivity on improving regret convergence.

Title: Global Tensor Motion Planning
Authors: An T. Le, Kay Hansel, João Carvalho, Joe Watson, Julen Urain, Armin Biess, Georgia Chalvatzaki, Jan Peters
Abstract: Batch planning is increasingly necessary to quickly produce diverse and high-quality motion plans for downstream learning applications, such as distillation and imitation learning. This paper presents Global Tensor Motion Planning (GTMP) -- a sampling-based motion planning algorithm comprising only tensor operations. We introduce a novel discretization structure represented as a random multipartite graph, enabling efficient vectorized sampling, collision checking, and search. We provide a theoretical investigation showing that GTMP exhibits probabilistic completeness while supporting modern GPU/TPU. Additionally, by incorporating smooth structures into the multipartite graph, GTMP directly plans smooth splines without requiring gradient-based optimization. Experiments on lidar-scanned occupancy maps and the MotionBenchMarker dataset demonstrate GTMP's computation efficiency in batch planning compared to baselines, underscoring GTMP's potential as a robust, scalable planner for diverse applications and large-scale robot learning tasks.

Title: Partially Observed Optimal Stochastic Control: Regularity, Optimality, Approximations, and Learning
Authors: Ali Devran Kara, Serdar Yuksel
Abstract: In this review/tutorial article, we present recent progress on optimal control of partially observed Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). We first present regularity and continuity conditions for POMDPs and their belief-MDP reductions, where these constitute weak Feller and Wasserstein regularity and controlled filter stability. These are then utilized to arrive at existence results on optimal policies for both discounted and average cost problems, and regularity of value functions. Then, we study rigorous approximation results involving quantization based finite model approximations as well as finite window approximations under controlled filter stability. Finally, we present several recent reinforcement learning theoretic results which rigorously establish convergence to near optimality under both criteria.

Title: Local Identifiability of Networks with Nonlinear Node Dynamics
Authors: Martina Vanelli, Julien M. Hendrickx
Abstract: We study the identifiability of nonlinear network systems with partial excitation and partial measurement when the network dynamics is linear on the edges and nonlinear on the nodes. We assume that the graph topology and the nonlinear functions at the node level are known, and we aim to identify the weight matrix of the graph. Our main result is to prove that fully-connected layered feed-forward networks are generically locally identifiable by exciting sources and measuring sinks in the class of analytic functions that cross the origin. This holds even when all other nodes remain unexcited and unmeasured and stands in sharp contrast to most findings on network identifiability requiring measurement and/or excitation of each node. The result applies in particular to feed-forward artificial neural networks with no offsets and generalizes previous literature by considering a broader class of functions and topologies.

Title: Audio Array-Based 3D UAV Trajectory Estimation with LiDAR Pseudo-Labeling
Authors: Allen Lei, Tianchen Deng, Han Wang, Jianfei Yang, Shenghai Yuan
Abstract: As small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) become increasingly prevalent, there is growing concern regarding their impact on public safety and privacy, highlighting the need for advanced tracking and trajectory estimation solutions. In response, this paper introduces a novel framework that utilizes audio array for 3D UAV trajectory estimation. Our approach incorporates a self-supervised learning model, starting with the conversion of audio data into mel-spectrograms, which are analyzed through an encoder to extract crucial temporal and spectral information. Simultaneously, UAV trajectories are estimated using LiDAR point clouds via unsupervised methods. These LiDAR-based estimations act as pseudo labels, enabling the training of an Audio Perception Network without requiring labeled data. In this architecture, the LiDAR-based system operates as the Teacher Network, guiding the Audio Perception Network, which serves as the Student Network. Once trained, the model can independently predict 3D trajectories using only audio signals, with no need for LiDAR data or external ground truth during deployment. To further enhance precision, we apply Gaussian Process modeling for improved spatiotemporal tracking. Our method delivers top-tier performance on the MMAUD dataset, establishing a new benchmark in trajectory estimation using self-supervised learning techniques without reliance on ground truth annotations.

Title: TAME: Temporal Audio-based Mamba for Enhanced Drone Trajectory Estimation and Classification
Authors: Zhenyuan Xiao, Huanran Hu, Guili Xu, Junwei He
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of compact UAVs has introduced significant risks to public safety, while traditional drone detection systems are often bulky and costly. To address these challenges, we present TAME, the Temporal Audio-based Mamba for Enhanced Drone Trajectory Estimation and Classification. This innovative anti-UAV detection model leverages a parallel selective state-space model to simultaneously capture and learn both the temporal and spectral features of audio, effectively analyzing propagation of sound. To further enhance temporal features, we introduce a Temporal Feature Enhancement Module, which integrates spectral features into temporal data using residual cross-attention. This enhanced temporal information is then employed for precise 3D trajectory estimation and classification. Our model sets a new standard of performance on the MMUAD benchmarks, demonstrating superior accuracy and effectiveness. The code and trained models are publicly available on GitHub \url{this https URL}.

Title: Stable-V2A: Synthesis of Synchronized Sound Effects with Temporal and Semantic Controls
Authors: Riccardo Fosco Gramaccioni, Christian Marinoni, Emilian Postolache, Marco Comunità, Luca Cosmo, Joshua D. Reiss, Danilo Comminiello
Abstract: Sound designers and Foley artists usually sonorize a scene, such as from a movie or video game, by manually annotating and sonorizing each action of interest in the video. In our case, the intent is to leave full creative control to sound designers with a tool that allows them to bypass the more repetitive parts of their work, thus being able to focus on the creative aspects of sound production. We achieve this presenting Stable-V2A, a two-stage model consisting of: an RMS-Mapper that estimates an envelope representative of the audio characteristics associated with the input video; and Stable-Foley, a diffusion model based on Stable Audio Open that generates audio semantically and temporally aligned with the target video. Temporal alignment is guaranteed by the use of the envelope as a ControlNet input, while semantic alignment is achieved through the use of sound representations chosen by the designer as cross-attention conditioning of the diffusion process. We train and test our model on Greatest Hits, a dataset commonly used to evaluate V2A models. In addition, to test our model on a case study of interest, we introduce Walking The Maps, a dataset of videos extracted from video games depicting animated characters walking in different locations. Samples and code available on our demo page at this https URL.

Title: RiTTA: Modeling Event Relations in Text-to-Audio Generation
Authors: Yuhang He, Yash Jain, Xubo Liu, Andrew Markham, Vibhav Vineet
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Text-to-Audio (TTA) generation models achieving high-fidelity audio with fine-grained context understanding, they struggle to model the relations between audio events described in the input text. However, previous TTA methods have not systematically explored audio event relation modeling, nor have they proposed frameworks to enhance this capability. In this work, we systematically study audio event relation modeling in TTA generation models. We first establish a benchmark for this task by: 1. proposing a comprehensive relation corpus covering all potential relations in real-world scenarios; 2. introducing a new audio event corpus encompassing commonly heard audios; and 3. proposing new evaluation metrics to assess audio event relation modeling from various perspectives. Furthermore, we propose a finetuning framework to enhance existing TTA models ability to model audio events relation. Code is available at: this https URL

Title: Text2midi: Generating Symbolic Music from Captions
Authors: Keshav Bhandari, Abhinaba Roy, Kyra Wang, Geeta Puri, Simon Colton, Dorien Herremans
Abstract: This paper introduces text2midi, an end-to-end model to generate MIDI files from textual descriptions. Leveraging the growing popularity of multimodal generative approaches, text2midi capitalizes on the extensive availability of textual data and the success of large language models (LLMs). Our end-to-end system harnesses the power of LLMs to generate symbolic music in the form of MIDI files. Specifically, we utilize a pretrained LLM encoder to process captions, which then condition an autoregressive transformer decoder to produce MIDI sequences that accurately reflect the provided descriptions. This intuitive and user-friendly method significantly streamlines the music creation process by allowing users to generate music pieces using text prompts. We conduct comprehensive empirical evaluations, incorporating both automated and human studies, that show our model generates MIDI files of high quality that are indeed controllable by text captions that may include music theory terms such as chords, keys, and tempo. We release the code and music samples on our demo page (this https URL) for users to interact with text2midi.

Title: Mamba-SEUNet: Mamba UNet for Monaural Speech Enhancement
Authors: Junyu Wang, Zizhen Lin, Tianrui Wang, Meng Ge, Longbiao Wang, Jianwu Dang
Abstract: In recent speech enhancement (SE) research, transformer and its variants have emerged as the predominant methodologies. However, the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism imposes certain limitations on practical deployment. Mamba, as a novel state-space model (SSM), has gained widespread application in natural language processing and computer vision due to its strong capabilities in modeling long sequences and relatively low computational complexity. In this work, we introduce Mamba-SEUNet, an innovative architecture that integrates Mamba with U-Net for SE tasks. By leveraging bidirectional Mamba to model forward and backward dependencies of speech signals at different resolutions, and incorporating skip connections to capture multi-scale information, our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Experimental results on the VCTK+DEMAND dataset indicate that Mamba-SEUNet attains a PESQ score of 3.59, while maintaining low computational complexity. When combined with the Perceptual Contrast Stretching technique, Mamba-SEUNet further improves the PESQ score to 3.73.

Title: Zero-resource Speech Translation and Recognition with LLMs
Authors: Karel Mundnich, Xing Niu, Prashant Mathur, Srikanth Ronanki, Brady Houston, Veera Raghavendra Elluru, Nilaksh Das, Zejiang Hou, Goeric Huybrechts, Anshu Bhatia, Daniel Garcia-Romero, Kyu J. Han, Katrin Kirchhoff
Abstract: Despite recent advancements in speech processing, zero-resource speech translation (ST) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) remain challenging problems. In this work, we propose to leverage a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) to perform ST and ASR in languages for which the model has never seen paired audio-text data. We achieve this by using a pre-trained multilingual speech encoder, a multilingual LLM, and a lightweight adaptation module that maps the audio representations to the token embedding space of the LLM. We perform several experiments both in ST and ASR to understand how to best train the model and what data has the most impact on performance in previously unseen languages. In ST, our best model is capable to achieve BLEU scores over 23 in CoVoST2 for two previously unseen languages, while in ASR, we achieve WERs of up to 28.2\%. We finally show that the performance of our system is bounded by the ability of the LLM to output text in the desired language.

Title: Towards Expressive Video Dubbing with Multiscale Multimodal Context Interaction
Authors: Yuan Zhao, Rui Liu, Gaoxiang Cong
Abstract: Automatic Video Dubbing (AVD) generates speech aligned with lip motion and facial emotion from scripts. Recent research focuses on modeling multimodal context to enhance prosody expressiveness but overlooks two key issues: 1) Multiscale prosody expression attributes in the context influence the current sentence's prosody. 2) Prosody cues in context interact with the current sentence, impacting the final prosody expressiveness. To tackle these challenges, we propose M2CI-Dubber, a Multiscale Multimodal Context Interaction scheme for AVD. This scheme includes two shared M2CI encoders to model the multiscale multimodal context and facilitate its deep interaction with the current sentence. By extracting global and local features for each modality in the context, utilizing attention-based mechanisms for aggregation and interaction, and employing an interaction-based graph attention network for fusion, the proposed approach enhances the prosody expressiveness of synthesized speech for the current sentence. Experiments on the Chem dataset show our model outperforms baselines in dubbing expressiveness. The code and demos are available at \textcolor[rgb]{0.93,0.0,0.47}{this https URL}.

Title: Spectral Enhancement and Pseudo-Anchor Guidance for Infrared-Visible Person Re-Identification
Authors: Yiyuan Ge, Zhihao Chen, Ziyang Wang, Jiaju Kang, Mingya Zhang
Abstract: The development of deep learning has facilitated the application of person re-identification (ReID) technology in intelligent security. Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) aims to match pedestrians across infrared and visible modality images enabling 24-hour surveillance. Current studies relying on unsupervised modality transformations as well as inefficient embedding constraints to bridge the spectral differences between infrared and visible images, however, limit their potential performance. To tackle the limitations of the above approaches, this paper introduces a simple yet effective Spectral Enhancement and Pseudo-anchor Guidance Network, named SEPG-Net. Specifically, we propose a more homogeneous spectral enhancement scheme based on frequency domain information and greyscale space, which avoids the information loss typically caused by inefficient modality transformations. Further, a Pseudo Anchor-guided Bidirectional Aggregation (PABA) loss is introduced to bridge local modality discrepancies while better preserving discriminative identity embeddings. Experimental results on two public benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SEPG-Net against other state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at this https URL.

Title: A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Autoencoder Framework for End-to-End Communication Systems
Authors: Bolun Zhang, Gan Zheng, Nguyen Van Huynh
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of quantum machine learning to End-to-End (E2E) communication systems in wireless fading scenarios. We introduce a novel hybrid quantum-classical autoencoder architecture that combines parameterized quantum circuits with classical deep neural networks (DNNs). Specifically, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical autoencoder (QAE) framework to optimize the E2E communication system. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed hybrid system, and reveal that it is the first work that can achieve comparable block error rate (BLER) performance to classical DNN-based and conventional channel coding schemes, while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters. Additionally, the proposed QAE exhibits steady and superior BLER convergence over the classical autoencoder baseline.
