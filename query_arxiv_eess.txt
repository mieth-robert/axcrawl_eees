Title: Generating Novel Brain Morphology by Deforming Learned Templates
Authors: Alan Q. Wang, Fangrui Huang, Bailey Trang, Wei Peng, Mohammad Abbasi, Kilian Pohl, Mert Sabuncu, Ehsan Adeli
Abstract: Designing generative models for 3D structural brain MRI that synthesize morphologically-plausible and attribute-specific (e.g., age, sex, disease state) samples is an active area of research. Existing approaches based on frameworks like GANs or diffusion models synthesize the image directly, which may limit their ability to capture intricate morphological details. In this work, we propose a 3D brain MRI generation method based on state-of-the-art latent diffusion models (LDMs), called MorphLDM, that generates novel images by applying synthesized deformation fields to a learned template. Instead of using a reconstruction-based autoencoder (as in a typical LDM), our encoder outputs a latent embedding derived from both an image and a learned template that is itself the output of a template decoder; this latent is passed to a deformation field decoder, whose output is applied to the learned template. A registration loss is minimized between the original image and the deformed template with respect to the encoder and both decoders. Empirically, our approach outperforms generative baselines on metrics spanning image diversity, adherence with respect to input conditions, and voxel-based morphometry.

Title: Weighted Combination and Singular Spectrum Analysis Based Remote Photoplethysmography Pulse Extraction in Low-light Environments
Authors: Lin Xi, Xingming Wu, Weihai Chen, Jianhua Wang, Changchen Zhao
Abstract: Camera-based vital signs monitoring in recent years has attracted more and more researchers and the results are promising. However, a few research works focus on heart rate extraction under extremely low illumination environments. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for remote heart rate estimation under low-light conditions. This method uses singular spectrum analysis (SSA) to decompose the filtered signal into several reconstructed components. A spectral masking algorithm is utilized to refine the preliminary candidate components on the basis of a reference heart rate. The contributive components are fused into the final pulse signal. To evaluate the performance of our framework in low-light conditions, the proposed approach is tested on a large-scale multi-illumination HR dataset (named MIHR). The test results verify that the proposed method has stronger robustness to low illumination than state-of-the-art methods, effectively improving the signal-to-noise ratio and heart rate estimation precision. We further perform experiments on the PUlse RatE detection (PURE) dataset which is recorded under normal light conditions to demonstrate the generalization of our method. The experiment results show that our method can stably detect pulse rate and achieve comparative results. The proposed method pioneers a new solution to the remote heart rate estimation in low-light conditions.

Title: Technical report of a DMD-based Characterization Method for Vision Sensors
Authors: Yapeng Meng, Taoyi Wang, Yihan Lin
Abstract: This technical report presents a novel DMD-based characterization method for vision sensors, particularly neuromorphic sensors such as event-based vision sensors (EVS) and Tianmouc, a complementary vision sensor. Traditional image sensor characterization standards, such as EMVA1288, are unsuitable for BVS due to their dynamic response characteristics. To address this, we propose a high-speed, high-precision testing system using a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) to modulate spatial and temporal light intensity. This approach enables quantitative analysis of key parameters such as event latency, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and dynamic range (DR) under controlled conditions. Our method provides a standardized and reproducible testing framework, overcoming the limitations of existing evaluation techniques for neuromorphic sensors. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of this method for large-scale BVS dataset generation and conversion, paving the way for more consistent benchmarking of bio-inspired vision technologies.

Title: ReRAW: RGB-to-RAW Image Reconstruction via Stratified Sampling for Efficient Object Detection on the Edge
Authors: Radu Berdan, Beril Besbinar, Christoph Reinders, Junji Otsuka, Daisuke Iso
Abstract: Edge-based computer vision models running on compact, resource-limited devices benefit greatly from using unprocessed, detail-rich RAW sensor data instead of processed RGB images. Training these models, however, necessitates large labeled RAW datasets, which are costly and often impractical to obtain. Thus, converting existing labeled RGB datasets into sensor-specific RAW images becomes crucial for effective model training. In this paper, we introduce ReRAW, an RGB-to-RAW conversion model that achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance across five diverse RAW datasets. This is accomplished through ReRAW's novel multi-head architecture predicting RAW image candidates in gamma space. The performance is further boosted by a stratified sampling-based training data selection heuristic, which helps the model better reconstruct brighter RAW pixels. We finally demonstrate that pretraining compact models on a combination of high-quality synthetic RAW datasets (such as generated by ReRAW) and ground-truth RAW images for downstream tasks like object detection, outperforms both standard RGB pipelines, and RAW fine-tuning of RGB-pretrained models for the same task.

Title: Tackling Few-Shot Segmentation in Remote Sensing via Inpainting Diffusion Model
Authors: Steve Andreas Immanuel, Woojin Cho, Junhyuk Heo, Darongsae Kwon
Abstract: Limited data is a common problem in remote sensing due to the high cost of obtaining annotated samples. In the few-shot segmentation task, models are typically trained on base classes with abundant annotations and later adapted to novel classes with limited examples. However, this often necessitates specialized model architectures or complex training strategies. Instead, we propose a simple approach that leverages diffusion models to generate diverse variations of novel-class objects within a given scene, conditioned by the limited examples of the novel classes. By framing the problem as an image inpainting task, we synthesize plausible instances of novel classes under various environments, effectively increasing the number of samples for the novel classes and mitigating overfitting. The generated samples are then assessed using a cosine similarity metric to ensure semantic consistency with the novel classes. Additionally, we employ Segment Anything Model (SAM) to segment the generated samples and obtain precise annotations. By using high-quality synthetic data, we can directly fine-tune off-the-shelf segmentation models. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances segmentation performance in low-data regimes, highlighting its potential for real-world remote sensing applications.

Title: Enhanced Beampattern Synthesis Using Electromagnetically Reconfigurable Antennas
Authors: Pinjun Zheng, Md. Jahangir Hossain, Anas Chaaban
Abstract: Beampattern synthesis seeks to optimize array weights to shape radiation patterns, playing a critical role in various wireless applications. In addition to theoretical advancements, recent hardware innovations have facilitated new avenues to enhance beampattern synthesis performance. This paper studies the beampattern synthesis problem using newly proposed electromagnetically reconfigurable antennas (ERAs). By utilizing spherical harmonics decomposition, we simultaneously optimize each antenna's radiation pattern and phase shift to match a desired beampattern of the entire array. The problem is formulated for both far-field and near-field scenarios, with the optimization solved using Riemannian manifold techniques. The simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution and illustrate that ERAs exhibit superior beampattern synthesis capabilities compared to conventional fixed radiation pattern antennas. This advantage becomes increasingly significant as the array size grows.

Title: Passive Sonar Sensor Placement for Undersea Surveillance
Authors: Graham V. Weinberg, Martijn van der Merwe
Abstract: Detection of undersea threats is a complex problem of considerable importance for maritime regional surveillance and security. Multistatic sonar systems can provide a means to monitor for underwater threats, where fixed sensors, towed arrays and dipping sonars may be utilised for this purpose. However, it is advantageous to deploy passive sensors to provide a stealthy early warning system. Hence this paper is concerned with determining where a series of passive sonar sensors should be situated in order to provide an initial threat detection capability. In order to facilitate this it is necessary to derive a suitable expression for the probability of threat detection from a passive sensor. This is based upon considerations of the passive sonar equation. It will be demonstrated how the stochastic aspects of this equation may be modelled through appropriate random variables capturing the uncertainty in noise levels. Subsequently this is utilised to produce the system-level probability of threat detection. Since the threat location is also unknown an appropriate statistical model is introduced to account for this uncertainty. This then permits the specification of the probability of detection as a function of sensor locations. Consequently it is then possible to determine optimal sensor placement to maximise the threat detection probability. This provides a new way in which to determine whether a surveillance region is covered adequately by sensors. The methodology will be illustrated through a series of examples utilising passive sonar characteristics sourced from the open literature.

Abstract: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) offers diverse imaging contrasts for assessment of cardiac function and tissue characterization. However, acquiring each single CMR modality is often time-consuming, and comprehensive clinical protocols require multiple modalities with various sampling patterns, further extending the overall acquisition time and increasing susceptibility to motion artifacts. Existing deep learning-based reconstruction methods are often designed for specific acquisition parameters, which limits their ability to generalize across a variety of scan scenarios. As part of the CMRxRecon Series, the CMRxRecon2024 challenge provides diverse datasets encompassing multi-modality multi-view imaging with various sampling patterns, and a platform for the international community to develop and benchmark reconstruction solutions in two well-crafted tasks. Task 1 is a modality-universal setting, evaluating the out-of-distribution generalization of the reconstructed model, while Task 2 follows sampling-universal setting assessing the one-for-all adaptability of the universal model. Main contributions include providing the first and largest publicly available multi-modality, multi-view cardiac k-space dataset; developing a benchmarking platform that simulates clinical acceleration protocols, with a shared code library and tutorial for various k-t undersampling patterns and data processing; giving technical insights of enhanced data consistency based on physic-informed networks and adaptive prompt-learning embedding to be versatile to different clinical settings; additional finding on evaluation metrics to address the limitations of conventional ground-truth references in universal reconstruction tasks.

Title: RIS-enabled Multi-user M-QAM Uplink NOMA Systems: Design, Analysis, and Optimization
Authors: Mahmoud AlaaEldin, Mohammad Al-Jarrah, Xidong Mu, Emad Alsusa, Karim G. Seddik, Michail Matthaiou
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is widely recognized for enhancing the energy and spectral efficiency through effective radio resource sharing. However, uplink NOMA systems face greater challenges than their downlink counterparts, as their bit error rate (BER) performance is hindered by an inherent error floor due to error propagation caused by imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC). This paper investigates BER performance improvements enabled by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in multi-user uplink NOMA transmission. Specifically, we propose a novel RIS-assisted uplink NOMA design, where the RIS phase shifts are optimized to enhance the received signal amplitudes while mitigating the phase rotations induced by the channel. To achieve this, we first develop an accurate channel model for the effective user channels, which facilitates our BER analysis. We then introduce a channel alignment scheme for a two-user scenario, enabling efficient SIC-based detection and deriving closed-form BER expressions. We further extend the analysis to a generalized setup with an arbitrary number of users and modulation orders for quadrature amplitude modulation signaling. Using the derived BER expressions, we develop an optimized uplink NOMA power allocation (PA) scheme that minimizes the average BER while satisfying the user transmit power constraints. It will be shown that the proposed NOMA detection scheme, in conjunction with the optimized PA strategy, eliminate SIC error floors at the base station. The theoretical BER expressions are validated using simulations, which confirms the effectiveness of the proposed design in eliminating BER floors.

Title: Vibration Analysis and Mitigation in Semiconductor Motion Stages Using DMAIC Methodology- A Case Study
Authors: Yin Li, Hua Chen, Fugee Tsung
Abstract: Motion stages are critical in semiconductor manufacturing equipment for processes like die bonding, wafer loading, and chip packaging, as their performance must meet the industry's stringent precision requirements. Vibration, a significant yet often overlooked adversary to precision motion stages, is challenging to identify and mitigate due to its subtle nature. This study, conducted at a motion stage manufacturer facing frequent vibration-related complaints, proposes a novel approach to resolving vibration issues. By leveraging the DMAIC methodology, it introduces VIBGUARD, an active vibration monitoring and mitigation solution, instead of solely focusing on traditional hardware vibration control. This comprehensive strategy enhances value and competitiveness, increasing UPH (units per hour) by 15.3% from 8,500 to 9,800 and reducing downtime by 68.2% from 2.2 to 0.7 occurrences per month. This case study and the DMAIC methodology offer valuable resources for quality control and problem analysis in the semiconductor industry.

Title: Robust Eavesdropping in the Presence of Adversarial Communications for RF Fingerprinting
Authors: Andrew Yuan, Rajeev Sahay
Abstract: Deep learning is an effective approach for performing radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting, which aims to identify the transmitter corresponding to received RF signals. However, beyond the intended receiver, malicious eavesdroppers can also intercept signals and attempt to fingerprint transmitters communicating over a wireless channel. Recent studies suggest that transmitters can counter such threats by embedding deep learning-based transferable adversarial attacks in their signals before transmission. In this work, we develop a time-frequency-based eavesdropper architecture that is capable of withstanding such transferable adversarial perturbations and thus able to perform effective RF fingerprinting. We theoretically demonstrate that adversarial perturbations injected by a transmitter are confined to specific time-frequency regions that are insignificant during inference, directly increasing fingerprinting accuracy on perturbed signals intercepted by the eavesdropper. Empirical evaluations on a real-world dataset validate our theoretical findings, showing that deep learning-based RF fingerprinting eavesdroppers can achieve classification performance comparable to the intended receiver, despite efforts made by the transmitter to deceive the eavesdropper. Our framework reveals that relying on transferable adversarial attacks may not be sufficient to prevent eavesdroppers from successfully fingerprinting transmissions in next-generation deep learning-based communications systems.

Title: Formally Verified Neural Network Controllers for Incremental Input-to-State Stability of Unknown Discrete-Time Systems
Authors: Ahan Basu, Bhabani Shankar Dey, Pushpak Jagtap
Abstract: This work aims to synthesize a controller that ensures that an unknown discrete-time system is incrementally input-to-state stable ($\delta$-ISS). In this work, we introduce the notion of $\delta$-ISS control Lyapunov function ($\delta$-ISS-CLF), which, in conjunction with the controller, ensures that the closed-loop system is incrementally ISS. To address the unknown dynamics of the system, we parameterize the controller as well as the $\delta$-ISS-CLF as neural networks and learn them by utilizing the sampled data from the state space of the unknown system. To formally verify the obtained $\delta$-ISS-CLF, we develop a validity condition and incorporate the condition into the training framework to ensure a provable correctness guarantee at the end of the training process. Finally, the usefulness of the proposed approach is proved using multiple case studies - the first one is a scalar system with a non-affine non-polynomial structure, the second example is a one-link manipulator system, the third system is a nonlinear Moore-Grietzer model of the jet engine and the final one is a rotating rigid spacecraft model.

Title: FLAME: A Federated Learning Approach for Multi-Modal RF Fingerprinting
Authors: Kiarash Kianfar, Rajeev Sahay
Abstract: Authorization systems are increasingly relying on processing radio frequency (RF) waveforms at receivers to fingerprint (i.e., determine the identity) of the corresponding transmitter. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a popular paradigm to perform RF fingerprinting in networks with multiple access points (APs), as they allow effective deep learning-based device identification without requiring the centralization of locally collected RF signals stored at multiple APs. Yet, FL algorithms that operate merely on in-phase and quadrature (IQ) time samples incur high convergence rates, resulting in excessive training rounds and inefficient training times. In this work, we propose FLAME: an FL approach for multimodal RF fingerprinting. Our framework consists of simultaneously representing received RF waveforms in multiple complimentary modalities beyond IQ samples in an effort to reduce training times. We theoretically demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our methodology and derive a convergence bound that incurs lower loss and thus higher accuracies in the same training round in comparison to single-modal FL-based RF fingerprinting. Extensive empirical evaluations validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the superiority of FLAME with with improvements of up to 30% in comparison to multiple considered baselines.

Title: An Uncertainty Quantification Framework for Deep Learning-Based Automatic Modulation Classification
Authors: Huian Yang, Rajeev Sahay
Abstract: Deep learning has been shown to be highly effective for automatic modification classification (AMC), which is a pivotal technology for next-generation cognitive communications. Yet, existing deep learning methods for AMC often lack robust mechanisms for uncertainty quantification (UQ). This limitation restricts their ability to produce accurate and reliable predictions in real-world environments, where signals can be perturbed as a result of several factors such as interference and low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). To address this problem, we propose a deep ensemble approach that leverages multiple convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to generate predictive distributions, as opposed to point estimates produced by standard deep learning models, which produce statistical characteristics that quantify the uncertainty associated with each prediction. We validate our approach using real-world AMC data, evaluating performance through multiple UQ metrics in a variety of signal environments. Our results show that our proposed ensemble-based framework captures uncertainty to a greater degree compared to previously proposed baselines in multiple settings, including in-distribution samples, out-of-distribution samples, and low SNR signals. These findings highlight the strong UQ capabilities of our ensemble-based AMC approach, paving the way for more robust deep learning-based AMC.

Title: Frequency-Based Alignment of EEG and Audio Signals Using Contrastive Learning and SincNet for Auditory Attention Detection
Authors: Yuan Liao, Yuhong Zhang, Qiushi Han, Yuhang Yang, Weiwei Ding, Yuzhe Gu, Hengxin Yang, Liya Huang
Abstract: Humans exhibit a remarkable ability to focus auditory attention in complex acoustic environments, such as cocktail parties. Auditory attention detection (AAD) aims to identify the attended speaker by analyzing brain signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG) data. Existing AAD algorithms often leverage deep learning's powerful nonlinear modeling capabilities, few consider the neural mechanisms underlying auditory processing in the brain. In this paper, we propose SincAlignNet, a novel network based on an improved SincNet and contrastive learning, designed to align audio and EEG features for auditory attention detection. The SincNet component simulates the brain's processing of audio during auditory attention, while contrastive learning guides the model to learn the relationship between EEG signals and attended speech. During inference, we calculate the cosine similarity between EEG and audio features and also explore direct inference of the attended speaker using EEG data. Cross-trial evaluations results demonstrate that SincAlignNet outperforms state-of-the-art AAD methods on two publicly available datasets, KUL and DTU, achieving average accuracies of 78.3% and 92.2%, respectively, with a 1-second decision window. The model exhibits strong interpretability, revealing that the left and right temporal lobes are more active during both male and female speaker scenarios. Furthermore, we found that using data from only six electrodes near the temporal lobes maintains similar or even better performance compared to using 64 electrodes. These findings indicate that efficient low-density EEG online decoding is achievable, marking an important step toward the practical implementation of neuro-guided hearing aids in real-world applications.

Title: Deep Joint CSI Estimation-Feedback-Precoding for MU-MIMO OFDM Systems
Authors: Yiran Guo, Wei Chen, Bo Ai, Lun Li
Abstract: As the number of antennas in frequency-division duplex (FDD) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems increases, acquiring channel state information (CSI) becomes increasingly challenging due to limited spectral resources and feedback overhead. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end network that conducts joint design with pilot design, CSI estimation, CSI feedback, and precoding design in the multi-user MIMO orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) scenario. Multiple communication modules are jointly designed and trained with a common optimization objective to prevent mismatches between modules and discrepancies between individual module objectives and the final system goal. Experimental results demonstrate that, under the same feedback and CE overheads, the proposed joint multi-module end-to-end network achieves a higher multi-user downlink spectral efficiency than traditional algorithms based on separate architecture and partially separated artificial intelligence-based network architectures under comparable channel quality. Furthermore, compared to conventional separate architecture, the proposed network architecture with joint architecture reduces the computational burden and model storage overhead at the UE side, facilitating the deployment of low-overhead multi-module joint architectures in practice. While slightly increasing storage requirements at the base station, it reduces computational complexity and precoding design delay, effectively reducing the effects of channel aging challenges.

Title: Personalized Emotion Detection from Floor Vibrations Induced by Footsteps
Authors: Yuyan Wu, Yiwen Dong, Sumer Vaid, Gabriella M. Harari, Hae Young Noh
Abstract: Emotion recognition is critical for various applications such as early detection of mental health disorders and emotion based smart home systems. Previous studies used various sensing methods for emotion recognition, such as wearable sensors, cameras, and microphones. However, these methods have limitations in long term domestic, including intrusiveness and privacy concerns. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a nonintrusive and privacy friendly personalized emotion recognition system, EmotionVibe, which leverages footstep induced floor vibrations for emotion recognition. The main idea of EmotionVibe is that individuals' emotional states influence their gait patterns, subsequently affecting the floor vibrations induced by their footsteps. However, there are two main research challenges: 1) the complex and indirect relationship between human emotions and footstep induced floor vibrations and 2) the large between person variations within the relationship between emotions and gait patterns. To address these challenges, we first empirically characterize this complex relationship and develop an emotion sensitive feature set including gait related and vibration related features from footstep induced floor vibrations. Furthermore, we personalize the emotion recognition system for each user by calculating gait similarities between the target person (i.e., the person whose emotions we aim to recognize) and those in the training dataset and assigning greater weights to training people with similar gait patterns in the loss function. We evaluated our system in a real-world walking experiment with 20 participants, summing up to 37,001 footstep samples. EmotionVibe achieved the mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.11 and 1.07 for valence and arousal score estimations, respectively, reflecting 19.0% and 25.7% error reduction compared to the baseline method.

Title: Adaptive Subarray Segmentation: A New Paradigm of Spatial Non-Stationary Near-Field Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO Systems
Authors: Shuhang Yang, Puguang An, Peng Yang, Xianbin Cao, Dapeng Oliver Wu, Tony Q. S. Quek
Abstract: To tackle the complexities of spatial non-stationary (SnS) effects and spherical wave propagation in near-field channel estimation (CE) for extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems, this paper introduces an innovative SnS near-field CE framework grounded in adaptive subarray partitioning. Conventional methods relying on equal subarray partitioning often lead to suboptimal divisions, undermining CE precision. To overcome this, we propose an adaptive subarray segmentation approach. First, we develop a spherical-wave channel model customized for line-of-sight (LoS) XL-MIMO systems to capture SnS traits. Next, we define and evaluate the adverse effects of over-segmentation and under-segmentation on CE efficacy. To counter these issues, we introduce a novel dynamic hybrid beamforming-assisted power-based subarray segmentation paradigm (DHBF-PSSP), which merges cost-effective power measurements with a DHBF structure, enabling joint subarray partitioning and decoupling. A robust partitioning algorithm, termed power-adaptive subarray segmentation (PASS), exploits statistical features of power profiles, while the DHBF utilizes subarray segmentation-based group time block code (SS-GTBC) to enable efficient subarray decoupling with limited radio frequency (RF) chain resources. Additionally, by utilizing angular-domain block sparsity and inter-subcarrier structured sparsity, we propose a subarray segmentation-based assorted block sparse Bayesian learning algorithm under the multiple measurement vectors framework (SS-ABSBL-MMV), employing discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebooks to lower complexity. Extensive simulation results validate the exceptional performance of the proposed framework over its counterparts.

Title: Digital twin with automatic disturbance detection for an expert-controlled SAG mill
Authors: Paulina Quintanilla, Francisco Fernández, Cristóbal Mancilla, Matías Rojas, Daniel Navia
Abstract: This study presents the development and validation of a digital twin for a semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mill controlled by an expert system. The digital twin integrates three key components of the closed-loop operation: (1) fuzzy logic for expert control, (2) a state-space model for regulatory control, and (3) a recurrent neural network to simulate the SAG mill process. The digital twin is combined with a statistical framework for automatically detecting process disturbances (or critical operations), which triggers model retraining only when deviations from expected behaviour are identified, ensuring continuous updates with new data to enhance the SAG supervision. The model was trained with 68 hours of operational industrial data and validated with an additional 8 hours, allowing it to predict mill behaviour within a 2.5-minute horizon at 30-second intervals with errors smaller than 5%.

Title: Learning Wideband User Scheduling and Hybrid Precoding with Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Shengjie Liu, Chenyang Yang, Shengqian Han
Abstract: Spatial-frequency scheduling and hybrid precoding in wideband multi-user multi-antenna systems have never been learned jointly due to the challenges arising from the massive user combinations on resource blocks (RBs) and the shared analog precoder among RBs. In this paper, we strive to jointly learn the scheduling and precoding policies with graph neural networks (GNNs), which have emerged as a powerful tool for optimizing resource allocation thanks to their potential in generalizing across problem scales. By reformulating the joint optimization problem into an equivalent functional optimization problem for the scheduling and precoding policies, we propose a GNN-based architecture consisting of two cascaded modules to learn the two policies. We discover a same-parameter same-decision (SPSD) property for wireless policies defined on sets, revealing that a GNN cannot well learn the optimal scheduling policy when users have similar channels. This motivates us to develop a sequence of GNNs to enhance the scheduling module. Furthermore, by analyzing the SPSD property, we find when linear aggregators in GNNs impede size generalization. Based on the observation, we devise a novel attention mechanism for information aggregation in the precoder module. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves satisfactory spectral efficiency with short inference time and low training complexity, and is generalizable to the numbers of users, RBs, and antennas at the base station and users.

Title: Performance Analysis of Multirate Systems: A Direct Frequency-Domain Identification Approach
Authors: Max van Haren, Lennart Blanken, Tom Oomen
Abstract: Frequency-domain performance analysis of intersample behavior in sampled-data and multirate systems is challenging due to the lack of a frequency-separation principle, and systematic identification techniques are lacking. The aim of this \manuscript is to develop an efficient technique for identifying the full intersample performance in the frequency-domain for closed-loop multirate systems, in particular the Performance Frequency Gain (PFG). Through local modeling techniques, aliased frequency components are effectively disentangled when identifying the PFG, which is directly facilitated by frequency-lifting the multirate system to a multivariable time-invariant representation. The developed method accurately and directly identifies the PFG in a single identification experiment. Finally, the developed method is experimentally validated on a prototype motion system, showing accurate identification of frequency-domain representations for the multirate system, including the PFG.

Title: On the Connection Between Magnetic-Field Odometry Aided Inertial Navigation and Magnetic-Field SLAM
Authors: Isaac Skog, Manon Kok, Gustaf Hendeby, Chuan Huang, Thomas Edridge
Abstract: Magnetic-field simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) using consumer-grade inertial and magnetometer sensors offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for indoor localization. However, the rapid error accumulation in the inertial navigation process limits the feasible exploratory phases of these systems. Advances in magnetometer array processing have demonstrated that odometry information, i.e., displacement and rotation information, can be extracted from local magnetic field variations and used to create magnetic-field odometry-aided inertial navigation systems. The error growth rate of these systems is significantly lower than that of standalone inertial navigation systems. This study seeks an answer to whether a magnetic-field SLAM system fed with measurements from a magnetometer array can indirectly extract odometry information -- without requiring algorithmic modifications -- and thus sustain longer exploratory phases. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show that such a system can extract odometry information and indirectly create a magnetic field odometry-aided inertial navigation system during the exploration phases. However, practical challenges related to map resolution and computational complexity remain significant.

Title: GBT-SAM: A Parameter-Efficient Depth-Aware Model for Generalizable Brain tumour Segmentation on mp-MRI
Authors: Cecilia Diana-Albelda, Roberto Alcover-Couso, Álvaro García-Martín, Jesus Bescos, Marcos Escudero-Viñolo
Abstract: Gliomas are brain tumours that stand out for their highly lethal and aggressive nature, which demands a precise approach in their diagnosis. Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in the evaluation and follow-up of these tumours, allowing specialists to analyse their morphology. However, existing methods for automatic glioma segmentation often lack generalization capability across other brain tumour domains, require extensive computational resources, or fail to fully utilize the multi-parametric MRI (mp-MRI) data used to delineate them. In this work, we introduce GBT-SAM, a novel Generalizable Brain Tumour (GBT) framework that extends the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to brain tumour segmentation tasks. Our method employs a two-step training protocol: first, fine-tuning the patch embedding layer to process the entire mp-MRI modalities, and second, incorporating parameter-efficient LoRA blocks and a Depth-Condition block into the Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture inter-slice correlations. GBT-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Adult Glioma dataset (Dice Score of $93.54$) while demonstrating robust generalization across Meningioma, Pediatric Glioma, and Sub-Saharan Glioma datasets. Furthermore, GBT-SAM uses less than 6.5M trainable parameters, thus offering an efficient solution for brain tumour segmentation. \\ Our code and models are available at this https URL .

Title: Stability analysis for nonlinear compressor system and active adaptive controller against surge with antisurge valve
Authors: Seyed Mohammad Hosseindokht
Abstract: In this paper, a compressor system is analyzed in order to show its characteristics and design a control scheme to improve its efficiency. A mathematical technique has been created to forecast the onset of surge and instability in a compressor chart, drawing from the nonlinear Greitzer and Moore model. This approach employs the phase plane and Jacobian matrix to identify both stable and unstable regions within the compressor, as well as to capture the limit cycle within the unstable region. A predictive analytical approach for anticipating compressor surge and instability is of great importance in system instrumentation and control. State space model is built up by nonlinear Greitzer equations. Validation from previous study about especial compressor will be considered for evaluation of mathematic method. Upstream flow acts as a disturbance to control loop and controller cannot satisfy desired requirements with flow variances, ergo it is essential that controller is adapted to new conditions. Since control signal is linearly related to system output, a PD controller is used to control compressor system. An adaptive PD controller is designed with MRAS method based on a reference model. Adaptive controller can stabilize compressor and increase its efficiency in the presence of any disturbances. Simulation results shows that an adaptive controller can provide good performance and convergence in case of speed changes by adapting gain parameters, and adaptive will be compared with normal PID. Finally, controller stability is investigated.

Title: Proactive Robust Hardening of Resilient Power Distribution Network: Decision-Dependent Uncertainty Modeling and Fast Solution Strategy
Authors: Donglai Ma, Xiaoyu Cao, Bo Zeng, Qing-Shan Jia, Chen Chen, Qiaozhu Zhai, Xiaohong Guan
Abstract: To address the power system hardening problem, traditional approaches often adopt robust optimization (RO) that considers a fixed set of concerned contingencies, regardless of the fact that hardening some components actually renders relevant contingencies impractical. In this paper, we directly adopt a dynamic uncertainty set that explicitly incorporates the impact of hardening decisions on the worst-case contingencies, which leads to a decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) set. Then, a DDU-based robust-stochastic optimization (DDU-RSO) model is proposed to support the hardening decisions on distribution lines and distributed generators (DGs). Also, the randomness of load variations and available storage levels is considered through stochastic programming (SP) in the innermost level problem. Various corrective measures (e.g., the joint scheduling of DGs and energy storage) are included, coupling with a finite support of stochastic scenarios, for resilience enhancement. To relieve the computation burden of this new hardening formulation, an enhanced customization of parametric column-and-constraint generation (P-C&CG) algorithm is developed. By leveraging the network structural information, the enhancement strategies based on resilience importance indices are designed to improve the convergence performance. Numerical results on 33-bus and 118-bus test distribution networks have demonstrated the effectiveness of DDU-RSO aided hardening scheme. Furthermore, in comparison to existing solution methods, the enhanced P-C&CG has achieved a superior performance by reducing the solution time by a few orders of magnitudes.

Title: Ambiguity Function Analysis and Optimization of Frequency-Hopping MIMO Radar with Movable Antennas
Authors: Xiang Chen, Ming-Min Zhao, Min Li, Liyan Li, Min-Jian Zhao, Jiangzhou Wang
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a movable antenna (MA)-enabled frequency-hopping (FH) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar system and investigate its sensing resolution. Specifically, we derive the expression of the ambiguity function and analyze the relationship between its main lobe width and the transmit antenna positions. In particular, the optimal antenna distribution to achieve the minimum main lobe width in the angular domain is characterized. We discover that this minimum width is related to the antenna size, the antenna number, and the target angle. Meanwhile, we present lower bounds of the ambiguity function in the Doppler and delay domains, and show that the impact of the antenna size on the radar performance in these two domains is very different from that in the angular domain. Moreover, the performance enhancement brought by MAs exhibits a certain trade-off between the main lobe width and the side lobe peak levels. Therefore, we propose to balance between minimizing the side lobe levels and narrowing the main lobe of the ambiguity function by optimizing the antenna positions. To achieve this goal, we propose a low-complexity algorithm based on the Rosen's gradient projection method, and show that its performance is very close to the baseline. Simulation results are presented to validate the theoretical analysis on the properties of the ambiguity function, and demonstrate that MAs can reduce the main lobe width and suppress the side lobe levels of the ambiguity function, thereby enhancing radar performance.

Title: AOLO: Analysis and Optimization For Low-Carbon Oriented Wireless Large Language Model Services
Authors: Xiaoqi Wang, Hongyang Du, Yuehong Gao, Dong In Kim
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to their widespread adoption and large-scale deployment across various domains. However, their environmental impact, particularly during inference, has become a growing concern due to their substantial energy consumption and carbon footprint. Existing research has focused on inference computation alone, overlooking the analysis and optimization of carbon footprint in network-aided LLM service systems. To address this gap, we propose AOLO, a framework for analysis and optimization for low-carbon oriented wireless LLM services. AOLO introduces a comprehensive carbon footprint model that quantifies greenhouse gas emissions across the entire LLM service chain, including computational inference and wireless communication. Furthermore, we formulate an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the overall carbon footprint, which is solved through joint optimization of inference outputs and transmit power under quality-of-experience and system performance constraints. To achieve this joint optimization, we leverage the energy efficiency of spiking neural networks (SNNs) by adopting SNN as the actor network and propose a low-carbon-oriented optimization algorithm, i.e., SNN-based deep reinforcement learning (SDRL). Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that SDRL algorithm significantly reduces overall carbon footprint, achieving an 18.77% reduction compared to the benchmark soft actor-critic, highlighting its potential for enabling more sustainable LLM inference services.

Title: Structural Damping Identification Sensitivity in Flutter Speed Estimation
Authors: Gabriele Dessena, Alessandro Pontillo, Marco Civera, Dmitry I. Ignatyev, James F. Whidborne, Luca Zanotti Fragonara
Abstract: Predicting flutter remains a key challenge in aeroelastic research, with certain models relying on modal parameters, such as natural frequencies and damping ratios. These models are particularly useful in early design stages or for the development of small UAVs (maximum take-off mass below 7 kg). This study evaluates two frequency-domain system identification methods, Fast Relaxed Vector Fitting (FRVF) and the Loewner Framework (LF), for predicting the flutter onset speed of a flexible wing model. Both methods are applied to extract modal parameters from Ground Vibration Testing data, which are subsequently used to develop a reduced-order model with two degrees of freedom. Results indicate that FRVF and LFinformed models provide reliable flutter speed, with predictions deviating by no more than 3% (FRVF) and 5% (LF) from the N4SID-informed benchmark. The findings highlight the sensitivity of flutter speed predictions to damping ratio identification accuracy and demonstrate the potential of these methods as computationally efficient alternatives for preliminary aeroelastic assessments.

Title: Precoder Learning for Weighted Sum Rate Maximization
Authors: Mingyu Deng, Shengqian Han
Abstract: Weighted sum rate maximization (WSRM) for precoder optimization effectively balances performance and fairness among users. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of deep learning in precoder optimization for sum rate maximization. However, the WSRM problem necessitates a redesign of neural network architectures to incorporate user weights into the input. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network (DNN) to learn the precoder for WSRM. Compared to existing DNNs, the proposed DNN leverage the joint unitary and permutation equivariant property inherent in the optimal precoding policy, effectively enhancing learning performance while reducing training complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms baseline learning methods in terms of both learning and generalization performance while maintaining low training and inference complexity.

Title: Reconstruction of Complex Baseband Signals via M-Periodic Nonuniform Bandpass Sampling and Least-Squares Optimal Time-Varying FIR Filters
Authors: Hakan Johansson
Abstract: This paper considers the reconstruction of digital complex baseband signals from M-periodically nonuniformly sampled real bandpass signals. With such a sampling, bandpass signals with arbitrary frequency locations can be sampled and reconstructed, as opposed to uniform sampling which requires the signal to be within one of the Nyquist bands. It is shown how the reconstruction can be carried out via an M-periodic time-varying finite-length impulse response (FIR) filter or, equivalently, a set of M time-invariant FIR filters. Then, a least-squares design method is proposed in which the M filter impulse responses are computed in closed form. This offers minimal filter orders for a given desired bandwidth. This is an advantage over an existing technique where ideal filters are first derived (ensuring perfect reconstruction) and then windowed and truncated, which leads to suboptimal filters and thus higher filter orders and implementation complexity. A design example illustrates the efficiency of the proposed design technique.

Title: Grid-Aware Islanding and Resynchronisation of AC/DC Microgrids
Authors: Willem Lambrichts, Jules Mace, Drazen Dujic, Mario Paolone
Abstract: This paper proposes an optimal, grid-aware control framework for the islanding, island-operation and resynchronisation of hybrid AC/DC microgrids. The optimal control framework is based on a formally derived linearized load-flow model for multiterminal hybrid AC/DC networks. The load flow model integrates the AC grid, DC grid, and interfacing converters (IC) into a unified representation. This work extends an existing load flow model to include the ICs' grid-forming operation. In traditional islanding control frameworks, the grid-forming converter is typically interfaced with an energy storage system that can provide bidirectional power to maintain the power balance. The proposed framework, however, allows the ICs to operate as the grid-forming unit while being connected to a DC grid rather than a single resource. This configuration allows for a wider operating range and, thus, a more flexible control. Furthermore, the optimal grid-aware control framework can steer the system to ensure a feasible operation without any grid constraint violations before, during, and after the islanding manoeuvre. The framework also guarantees smooth transitions, i.e., without any significant transient behaviour, when transitioning between grid-connected and islanding operations. The optimal control framework is experimentally validated on a 27-bus hybrid AC/DC network consisting of 3 ICs that interface the AC and DC networks. The hybrid grid hosts various controllable and stochastic resources.

Title: Power-Efficient Deceptive Wireless Beamforming Against Eavesdroppers
Authors: Georgios Chrysanidis, Antonios Argyriou, Le-Nam Tran, Yanming Zhang, Yanwei Liu
Abstract: Eavesdroppers of wireless signals want to infer as much as possible regarding the transmitter (Tx). Popular methods to minimize information leakage to the eavesdropper include covert communication, directional modulation, and beamforming with nulling. In this paper we do not attempt to prevent information leakage to the eavesdropper like the previous methods. Instead we propose to beamform the wireless signal at the Tx in such a way that it incorporates deceptive information. The beamformed orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal includes a deceptive value for the Doppler (velocity) and range of the Tx. To design the optimal baseband waveform with these characteristics, we define and solve an optimization problem for power-efficient deceptive wireless beamforming (DWB). The relaxed convex Quadratic Program (QP) is solved using a heuristic algorithm. Our simulation results indicate that our DWB scheme can successfully inject deceptive information with low power consumption, while preserving the shape of the created beam.

Title: Multistage Economic MPC for Systems with a Cyclic Steady State: A Gas Network Case Study
Authors: Sakshi S. Naik, Lavinia M. Ghilardi, Robert B. Parker, Lorenz T. Biegler
Abstract: Multistage model predictive control (MPC) provides a robust control strategy for dynamic systems with uncertainties and a setpoint tracking objective. Moreover, extending MPC to minimize an economic cost instead of tracking a pre-calculated optimal setpoint improves controller performance. In this paper, we develop a formulation for multistage economic MPC which directly minimizes an economic objective function. The multistage economic MPC framework is extended for systems with a cyclic steady state (CSS) and stability is guaranteed by employing a Lyapunov-based stability constraint. The multistage economic MPC framework is validated on two natural gas network case studies to minimize the net energy consumption during gas transmission. In both instances, the multistage economic MPC effectively manages uncertain demands by preventing constraint violations and guides the network to its optimal cyclic operating conditions. The Lyapunov function remains bounded in both instances, validating the robust stability of the controller.

Title: Adaptive Prototype Learning for Multimodal Cancer Survival Analysis
Authors: Hong Liu, Haosen Yang, Federica Eduati, Josien P.W. Pluim, Mitko Veta
Abstract: Leveraging multimodal data, particularly the integration of whole-slide histology images (WSIs) and transcriptomic profiles, holds great promise for improving cancer survival prediction. However, excessive redundancy in multimodal data can degrade model performance. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Prototype Learning (APL), a novel and effective approach for multimodal cancer survival analysis. APL adaptively learns representative prototypes in a data-driven manner, reducing redundancy while preserving critical information. Our method employs two sets of learnable query vectors that serve as a bridge between high-dimensional representations and survival prediction, capturing task-relevant features. Additionally, we introduce a multimodal mixed self-attention mechanism to enable cross-modal interactions, further enhancing information fusion. Extensive experiments on five benchmark cancer datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods. The code is available at this https URL.

Title: Mixed Near-field and Far-field Target Localization for Low-altitude Economy
Authors: Cong Zhou, Changsheng You, Chao Zhou, Hongqiang Cheng, Shuo Shi
Abstract: In this paper, we study efficient mixed near-field and far-field target localization methods for low-altitude economy, by capitalizing on extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) communication systems. Compared with existing works, we address three new challenges in localization, arising from 1) half-wavelength antenna spacing constraint, 2) hybrid uniform planar array (UPA) architecture, and 3) incorrect mixed-field target classification for near-field this http URL address these issues, we propose a new three-step mixed-field localization this http URL, we reconstruct the signals received at UPA antennas by judiciously designing analog combining matrices over time with minimum recovery errors, thus tackling the reduced-dimensional signal-space issue in hybrid this http URL, based on recovered signals, we devise a modified MUSIC algorithm (catered to UPA architecture) to estimate 2D angular parameters of both far- and near-field targets. Due to half-wavelength inter-antenna spacing, there exist ambiguous angles when estimating true angles of this http URL the third step, we design an effective classification method to distinguish mixed-field targets, determine true angles of all targets, as well as estimate the ranges of near-field targets. In particular, angular ambiguity is resolved by showing an important fact that the three types of estimated angles (i.e., far-field, near-field, and ambiguous angles) exhibit significantly different patterns in the range-domain MUSIC spectrum. Furthermore, to characterize the estimation error lower-bound, we obtain a matrix closed-form Cramér-Rao bounds for mixed-field target localization. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mixed-field localization method, which improves target-classification accuracy and achieves a lower root mean square error than various benchmark schemes.

Title: Scaling Rich Style-Prompted Text-to-Speech Datasets
Authors: Anuj Diwan, Zhisheng Zheng, David Harwath, Eunsol Choi
Abstract: We introduce Paralinguistic Speech Captions (ParaSpeechCaps), a large-scale dataset that annotates speech utterances with rich style captions. While rich abstract tags (e.g. guttural, nasal, pained) have been explored in small-scale human-annotated datasets, existing large-scale datasets only cover basic tags (e.g. low-pitched, slow, loud). We combine off-the-shelf text and speech embedders, classifiers and an audio language model to automatically scale rich tag annotations for the first time. ParaSpeechCaps covers a total of 59 style tags, including both speaker-level intrinsic tags and utterance-level situational tags. It consists of 342 hours of human-labelled data (PSC-Base) and 2427 hours of automatically annotated data (PSC-Scaled). We finetune Parler-TTS, an open-source style-prompted TTS model, on ParaSpeechCaps, and achieve improved style consistency (+7.9% Consistency MOS) and speech quality (+15.5% Naturalness MOS) over the best performing baseline that combines existing rich style tag datasets. We ablate several of our dataset design choices to lay the foundation for future work in this space. Our dataset, models and code are released at this https URL .

Title: An Extended State Space Model of Aggregated Electric Vehicles for Flexibility Estimation and Power Control
Authors: Yiping Liu, Xiaozhe Wang, Geza Joos
Abstract: The increasing penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) can provide substantial electricity to the grid, supporting the grids' stability. The state space model (SSM) has been proposed as an effective modeling method for power prediction and centralized control of aggregated EVs, offering low communication requirements and computational complexity. However, the SSM may overlook specific scenarios, leading to significant prediction and control inaccuracies. This paper proposes an extended state space model (eSSM) for aggregated EVs and develops associated control strategies. By accounting for the limited flexibility of fully charged and discharged EVs, the eSSM more accurately captures the state transition dynamics of EVs in various states of charge (SOC). Comprehensive simulations show that the eSSM will provide more accurate predictions of the flexibility and power trajectories of aggregated EVs, and more effectively tracks real-time power references compared to the conventional SSM method.

Title: Generative Diffusion Model-based Compression of MIMO CSI
Authors: Heasung Kim, Taekyun Lee, Hyeji Kim, Gustavo De Veciana, Mohamed Amine Arfaoui, Asil Koc, Phil Pietraski, Guodong Zhang, John Kaewell
Abstract: While neural lossy compression techniques have markedly advanced the efficiency of Channel State Information (CSI) compression and reconstruction for feedback in MIMO communications, efficient algorithms for more challenging and practical tasks-such as CSI compression for future channel prediction and reconstruction with relevant side information-remain underexplored, often resulting in suboptimal performance when existing methods are extended to these scenarios. To that end, we propose a novel framework for compression with side information, featuring an encoding process with fixed-rate compression using a trainable codebook for codeword quantization, and a decoding procedure modeled as a backward diffusion process conditioned on both the codeword and the side information. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms existing CSI compression algorithms, often yielding over twofold performance improvement by achieving comparable distortion at less than half the data rate of competing methods in certain scenarios. These findings underscore the potential of diffusion-based compression for practical deployment in communication systems.

Title: Efficient Finetuning for Dimensional Speech Emotion Recognition in the Age of Transformers
Authors: Aneesha Sampath, James Tavernor, Emily Mower Provost
Abstract: Accurate speech emotion recognition is essential for developing human-facing systems. Recent advancements have included finetuning large, pretrained transformer models like Wav2Vec 2.0. However, the finetuning process requires substantial computational resources, including high-memory GPUs and significant processing time. As the demand for accurate emotion recognition continues to grow, efficient finetuning approaches are needed to reduce the computational burden. Our study focuses on dimensional emotion recognition, predicting attributes such as activation (calm to excited) and valence (negative to positive). We present various finetuning techniques, including full finetuning, partial finetuning of transformer layers, finetuning with mixed precision, partial finetuning with caching, and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) on the Wav2Vec 2.0 base model. We find that partial finetuning with mixed precision achieves performance comparable to full finetuning while increasing training speed by 67%. Caching intermediate representations further boosts efficiency, yielding an 88% speedup and a 71% reduction in learnable parameters. We recommend finetuning the final three transformer layers in mixed precision to balance performance and training efficiency, and adding intermediate representation caching for optimal speed with minimal performance trade-offs. These findings lower the barriers to finetuning speech emotion recognition systems, making accurate emotion recognition more accessible to a broader range of researchers and practitioners.

Title: Beamforming Design for ISAC Systems with Suppressed Range-Angle Sidelobes
Authors: Meihui Liu, Shu Sun, Ruifeng Gao, Meixia Tao
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) represents a pivotal advancement for future wireless networks. This paper introduces a novel ISAC beamforming method for enhancing sensing performance while preserving communication quality by leveraging the ambiguity function (AF). We formulate an optimization problem to minimize the integrated sidelobe level ratio (ISLR) of the AF subject to the constraints of transmission power, communication signalto-interference-plus-noise ratio, and sensing gain. To address the non-convexity of the optimization problem, semidefinite relaxation is adopted. Numerical results show that our method significantly reduces range sidelobes and achieves a lower ISLR in the rangeangle domain compared to other approaches.

Title: Fair Play in the Fast Lane: Integrating Sportsmanship into Autonomous Racing Systems
Authors: Zhenmin Huang, Ce Hao, Wei Zhan, Jun Ma, Masayoshi Tomizuka
Abstract: Autonomous racing has gained significant attention as a platform for high-speed decision-making and motion control. While existing methods primarily focus on trajectory planning and overtaking strategies, the role of sportsmanship in ensuring fair competition remains largely unexplored. In human racing, rules such as the one-motion rule and the enough-space rule prevent dangerous and unsportsmanlike behavior. However, autonomous racing systems often lack mechanisms to enforce these principles, potentially leading to unsafe maneuvers. This paper introduces a bi-level game-theoretic framework to integrate sportsmanship (SPS) into versus racing. At the high level, we model racing intentions using a Stackelberg game, where Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is employed to derive optimal strategies. At the low level, vehicle interactions are formulated as a Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem (GNEP), ensuring that all agents follow sportsmanship constraints while optimizing their trajectories. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enforcing sportsmanship rules while maintaining competitive performance. We analyze different scenarios where attackers and defenders adhere to or disregard sportsmanship rules and show how knowledge of these constraints influences strategic decision-making. This work highlights the importance of balancing competition and fairness in autonomous racing and provides a foundation for developing ethical and safe AI-driven racing systems.

Title: Self is the Best Learner: CT-free Ultra-Low-Dose PET Organ Segmentation via Collaborating Denoising and Segmentation Learning
Authors: Zanting Ye, Xiaolong Niu, Xuanbin Wu, Wantong Lu, Lijun Lu
Abstract: Organ segmentation in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) plays a vital role in cancer quantification. Low-dose PET (LDPET) provides a safer alternative by reducing radiation exposure. However, the inherent noise and blurred boundaries make organ segmentation more challenging. Additionally, existing PET organ segmentation methods rely on co-registered Computed Tomography (CT) annotations, overlooking the problem of modality mismatch. In this study, we propose LDOS, a novel CT-free ultra-LDPET organ segmentation pipeline. Inspired by Masked Autoencoders (MAE), we reinterpret LDPET as a naturally masked version of Full-Dose PET (FDPET). LDOS adopts a simple yet effective architecture: a shared encoder extracts generalized features, while task-specific decoders independently refine outputs for denoising and segmentation. By integrating CT-derived organ annotations into the denoising process, LDOS improves anatomical boundary recognition and alleviates the PET/CT misalignments. Experiments demonstrate that LDOS achieves state-of-the-art performance with mean Dice scores of 73.11% (18F-FDG) and 73.97% (68Ga-FAPI) across 18 organs in 5% dose PET. Our code is publicly available.

Title: DDCSR: A Novel End-to-End Deep Learning Framework for Cortical Surface Reconstruction from Diffusion MRI
Authors: Chengjin Li, Yuqian Chen, Nir A. Sochen, Wei Zhang, Carl-Fredrik Westin, Rathi Yogesh, Lauren J. O'Donnell, Ofer Pasternak, Fan Zhang
Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) plays a crucial role in studying brain white matter connectivity. Cortical surface reconstruction (CSR), including the inner whiter matter (WM) and outer pial surfaces, is one of the key tasks in dMRI analyses such as fiber tractography and multimodal MRI analysis. Existing CSR methods rely on anatomical T1-weighted data and map them into the dMRI space through inter-modality registration. However, due to the low resolution and image distortions of dMRI data, inter-modality registration faces significant challenges. This work proposes a novel end-to-end learning framework, DDCSR, which for the first time enables CSR directly from dMRI data. DDCSR consists of two major components, including: (1) an implicit learning module to predict a voxel-wise intermediate surface representation, and (2) an explicit learning module to predict the 3D mesh surfaces. Compared to several baseline and advanced CSR methods, we show that the proposed DDCSR can largely increase both accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate a high generalization ability of DDCSR to data from different sources, despite the differences in dMRI acquisitions and populations.

Title: Pretrained LLMs as Real-Time Controllers for Robot Operated Serial Production Line
Authors: Muhammad Waseem, Kshitij Bhatta, Chen Li, Qing Chang
Abstract: The manufacturing industry is undergoing a transformative shift, driven by cutting-edge technologies like 5G, AI, and cloud computing. Despite these advancements, effective system control, which is crucial for optimizing production efficiency, remains a complex challenge due to the intricate, knowledge-dependent nature of manufacturing processes and the reliance on domain-specific expertise. Conventional control methods often demand heavy customization, considerable computational resources, and lack transparency in decision-making. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of using Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly GPT-4, as a straightforward, adaptable solution for controlling manufacturing systems, specifically, mobile robot scheduling. We introduce an LLM-based control framework to assign mobile robots to different machines in robot assisted serial production lines, evaluating its performance in terms of system throughput. Our proposed framework outperforms traditional scheduling approaches such as First-Come-First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Processing Time (SPT), and Longest Processing Time (LPT). While it achieves performance that is on par with state-of-the-art methods like Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), it offers a distinct advantage by delivering comparable throughput without the need for extensive retraining. These results suggest that the proposed LLM-based solution is well-suited for scenarios where technical expertise, computational resources, and financial investment are limited, while decision transparency and system scalability are critical concerns.

Title: Safe LLM-Controlled Robots with Formal Guarantees via Reachability Analysis
Authors: Ahmad Hafez, Alireza Naderi Akhormeh, Amr Hegazy, Amr Alanwar
Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in robotic systems presents unique safety challenges, particularly in unpredictable environments. Although LLMs, leveraging zero-shot learning, enhance human-robot interaction and decision-making capabilities, their inherent probabilistic nature and lack of formal guarantees raise significant concerns for safety-critical applications. Traditional model-based verification approaches often rely on precise system models, which are difficult to obtain for real-world robotic systems and may not be fully trusted due to modeling inaccuracies, unmodeled dynamics, or environmental uncertainties. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a safety assurance framework for LLM-controlled robots based on data-driven reachability analysis, a formal verification technique that ensures all possible system trajectories remain within safe operational limits. Our framework specifically investigates the problem of instructing an LLM to navigate the robot to a specified goal and assesses its ability to generate low-level control actions that successfully guide the robot safely toward that goal. By leveraging historical data to construct reachable sets of states for the robot-LLM system, our approach provides rigorous safety guarantees against unsafe behaviors without relying on explicit analytical models. We validate the framework through experimental case studies in autonomous navigation and task planning, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating risks associated with LLM-generated commands. This work advances the integration of formal methods into LLM-based robotics, offering a principled and practical approach to ensuring safety in next-generation autonomous systems.

Title: Equivariant Filter Design for Range-only SLAM
Authors: Yixiao Ge, Arthur Pearce, Pieter van Goor, Robert Mahony
Abstract: Range-only Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (RO-SLAM) is of interest due to its practical applications in ultra-wideband (UWB) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) localisation in terrestrial and aerial applications and acoustic beacon localisation in submarine applications. In this work, we consider a mobile robot equipped with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a range sensor that measures distances to a collection of fixed landmarks. We derive an equivariant filter (EqF) for the RO-SLAM problem based on a symmetry Lie group that is compatible with the range measurements. The proposed filter does not require bootstrapping or initialisation of landmark positions, and demonstrates robustness to the no-prior situation. The filter is demonstrated on a real-world dataset, and it is shown to significantly outperform a state-of-the-art EKF alternative in terms of both accuracy and robustness.

Title: Autonomous Robotic Bone Micro-Milling System with Automatic Calibration and 3D Surface Fitting
Authors: Enduo Zhao, Xiaofeng Lin, Yifan Wang, Kanako Harada
Abstract: Automating bone micro-milling using a robotic system presents challenges due to the uncertainties in both the external and internal features of bone tissue. For example, during a mouse cranial window creation, a circular path with a radius of 2 to 4 mm needs to be milled on the mouse skull using a microdrill. The uneven surface and non-uniform thickness of the mouse skull make it difficult to fully automate this process, requiring the system to possess advanced perceptual and adaptive capabilities. In this study, we propose an automatic calibration and 3D surface fitting method and integrate it into an autonomous robotic bone micro-milling system, enabling it to quickly, in real-time, and accurately perceive and adapt to the uneven surface and non-uniform thickness of the target without human assistance. Validation experiments on euthanized mice demonstrate that the improved system achieves a success rate of 85.7 % and an average milling time of 2.1 minutes, showing not only significant performance improvements over the previous system but also exceptional accuracy, speed, and stability compared to human operators.

Title: Joint Beamforming and Antenna Position Optimization for Fluid Antenna-Assisted MU-MIMO Networks
Authors: Tianyi Liao, Wei Guo, Hengtao He, Shenghui Song, Jun Zhang, Khaled B. Letaief
Abstract: The fluid antenna system (FAS) has emerged as a disruptive technology for future wireless networks, offering unprecedented degrees of freedom (DoF) through the dynamic configuration of antennas in response to propagation environment variations. The integration of fluid antennas (FAs) with multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) networks promises substantial weighted sum rate (WSR) gains via joint beamforming and FA position optimization. However, the joint design is challenging due to the strong coupling between beamforming matrices and antenna positions. To address the challenge, we propose a novel block coordinate ascent (BCA)-based method in FA-assisted MU-MIMO networks. Specifically, we first employ matrix fractional programming techniques to reformulate the original complex problem into a more tractable form. Then, we solve the reformulated problem following the BCA principle, where we develop a low-complexity majorization maximization algorithm capable of optimizing all FA positions simultaneously. To further reduce the computational, storage, and interconnection costs, we propose a decentralized implementation for our proposed algorithm by utilizing the decentralized baseband processing (DBP) architecture. Simulation results demonstrate that with our proposed algorithm, the FA-assisted MU-MIMO system achieves up to a 47% WSR improvement over conventional MIMO networks equipped with fixed-position antennas. Moreover, the decentralized implementation reduces computation time by approximately 70% and has similar performance compared with the centralized implementation.

Title: Object State Estimation Through Robotic Active Interaction for Biological Autonomous Drilling
Authors: Xiaofeng Lin, Enduo Zhao, Saúl Alexis Heredia Pérez, Kanako Harada
Abstract: Estimating the state of biological specimens is challenging due to limited observation through microscopic vision. For instance, during mouse skull drilling, the appearance alters little when thinning bone tissue because of its semi-transparent property and the high-magnification microscopic vision. To obtain the object's state, we introduce an object state estimation method for biological specimens through active interaction based on the deflection. The method is integrated to enhance the autonomous drilling system developed in our previous work. The method and integrated system were evaluated through 12 autonomous eggshell drilling experiment trials. The results show that the system achieved a 91.7% successful ratio and 75% detachable ratio, showcasing its potential applicability in more complex surgical procedures such as mouse skull craniotomy. This research paves the way for further development of autonomous robotic systems capable of estimating the object's state through active interaction.

Title: Quantitative Flow Approximation Properties of Narrow Neural ODEs
Authors: Karthik Elamvazhuthi
Abstract: In this note, we revisit the problem of flow approximation properties of neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs). The approximation properties have been considered as a flow controllability problem in recent literature. The neural ODE is considered {\it narrow} when the parameters have dimension equal to the input of the neural network, and hence have limited width. We derive the relation of narrow NODEs in approximating flows of shallow but wide NODEs. Due to existing results on approximation properties of shallow neural networks, this facilitates understanding which kind of flows of dynamical systems can be approximated using narrow neural ODEs. While approximation properties of narrow NODEs have been established in literature, the proofs often involve extensive constructions or require invoking deep controllability theorems from control theory. In this paper, we provide a simpler proof technique that involves only ideas from ODEs and Gr{ö}nwall's lemma. Moreover, we provide an estimate on the number of switches needed for the time dependent weights of the narrow NODE to mimic the behavior of a NODE with a single layer wide neural network as the velocity field.

Title: Energy-Efficient Port Selection and Beamforming Design for Integrated Data and Energy Transfer Assisted by Fluid Antennas
Authors: Long Zhang, Yizhe Zhao, Halvin Yang, Guangming Liang, Jie Hu
Abstract: Integrated data and energy transfer (IDET) is considered as a key enabler of 6G, as it can provide both wireless energy transfer (WET) and wireless data transfer (WDT) services towards low power devices. Thanks to the extra degree of freedom provided by fluid antenna (FA), incorporating FA into IDET systems presents a promising approach to enhance energy efficiency performance. This paper investigates a FA assisted IDET system, where the transmitter is equipped with multiple FAs and transmits wireless signals to the data receiver (DR) and the energy receiver (ER), which are both equipped with a single traditional antenna. The switching delay and energy consumption induced by port selection are taken into account in IDET system for the first time. We aim to obtain the optimal beamforming vector and the port selection strategy at the transmitter, in order to maximize the short-term and long-term WET efficiency, respectively. The instant sub-optimal solution is obtained by alternatively optimizing the beamforming vector and port selection in each transmission frame, while a novel constrained soft actor critic (C-SAC) algorithm is proposed to find the feasible policy of port selection from the long-term perspective. Simulation results demonstrate that our scheme is able to achieve greater gain in terms of both the short-term and long-term WET efficiency compared to other benchmarks, while not degrading WDT performance.

Title: Simulation-based Analysis Of Highway Trajectory Planning Using High-Order Polynomial For Highly Automated Driving Function
Authors: Milin Patel, Marzana Khatun, Rolf Jung, Michael Glaß
Abstract: One of the fundamental tasks of autonomous driving is safe trajectory planning, the task of deciding where the vehicle needs to drive, while avoiding obstacles, obeying safety rules, and respecting the fundamental limits of road. Real-world application of such a method involves consideration of surrounding environment conditions and movements such as Lane Change, collision avoidance, and lane merge. The focus of the paper is to develop and implement safe collision free highway Lane Change trajectory using high order polynomial for Highly Automated Driving Function (HADF). Planning is often considered as a higher-level process than control. Behavior Planning Module (BPM) is designed that plans the high-level driving actions like Lane Change maneuver to safely achieve the functionality of transverse guidance ensuring safety of the vehicle using motion planning in a scenario including environmental situation. Based on the recommendation received from the (BPM), the function will generate a desire corresponding trajectory. The proposed planning system is situation specific with polynomial based algorithm for same direction two lane highway scenario. To support the trajectory system polynomial curve can be used to reduces overall complexity and thereby allows rapid computation. The proposed Lane Change scenario is modeled, and results has been analyzed (verified and validate) through the MATLAB simulation environment. The method proposed in this paper has achieved a significant improvement in safety and stability of Lane Changing maneuver.

Title: TAIL: Text-Audio Incremental Learning
Authors: Yingfei Sun, Xu Gu, Wei Ji, Hanbin Zhao, Hao Fei, Yifang Yin, Roger Zimmermann
Abstract: Many studies combine text and audio to capture multi-modal information but they overlook the model's generalization ability on new datasets. Introducing new datasets may affect the feature space of the original dataset, leading to catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, large model parameters can significantly impact training performance. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel task called Text-Audio Incremental Learning (TAIL) task for text-audio retrieval, and propose a new method, PTAT, Prompt Tuning for Audio-Text incremental learning. This method utilizes prompt tuning to optimize the model parameters while incorporating an audio-text similarity and feature distillation module to effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We benchmark our method and previous incremental learning methods on AudioCaps, Clotho, BBC Sound Effects and Audioset datasets, and our method outperforms previous methods significantly, particularly demonstrating stronger resistance to forgetting on older datasets. Compared to the full-parameters Finetune (Sequential) method, our model only requires 2.42\% of its parameters, achieving 4.46\% higher performance.

Title: A General Framework for Scalable UE-AP Association in User-Centric Cell-Free Massive MIMO based on Recurrent Neural Networks
Authors: Giovanni Di Gennaro, Amedeo Buonanno, Gianmarco Romano, Stefano Buzzi, Francesco A. N. Palmieri
Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of access point (AP) and user equipment (UE) association in cell-free massive MIMO networks. It introduces a deep learning algorithm leveraging Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory cells and a hybrid probabilistic methodology for weight updating. This approach enhances scalability by adapting to variations in the number of UEs without requiring retraining. Additionally, the study presents a training methodology that improves scalability not only with respect to the number of UEs but also to the number of APs. Furthermore, a variant of the proposed AP-UE algorithm ensures robustness against pilot contamination effects, a critical issue arising from pilot reuse in channel estimation. Extensive numerical results validate the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed methods, demonstrating their superiority over widely used heuristic alternatives.

Title: Manipulation of Elasto-Flexible Cables with Single or Multiple UAVs
Authors: Chiara Gabellieri, Lars Teeuwen, Yaolei Shen, Antonio Franchi
Abstract: This work considers a large class of systems composed of multiple quadrotors manipulating deformable and extensible cables. The cable is described via a discretized representation, which decomposes it into linear springs interconnected through lumped-mass passive spherical joints. Sets of flat outputs are found for the systems. Numerical simulations support the findings by showing cable manipulation relying on flatness-based trajectories. Eventually, we present an experimental validation of the effectiveness of the proposed discretized cable model for a two-robot example. Moreover, a closed-loop controller based on the identified model and using cable-output feedback is experimentally tested.

Title: Energy Consumption of Robotic Arm with the Local Reduction Method
Authors: Halima Ibrahim Kure, Jishna Retnakumari, Lucian Nita, Saeed Sharif, Hamed Balogun, Augustine O. Nwajana
Abstract: Energy consumption in robotic arms is a significant concern in industrial automation due to rising operational costs and environmental impact. This study investigates the use of a local reduction method to optimize energy efficiency in robotic systems without compromising performance. The approach refines movement parameters, minimizing energy use while maintaining precision and operational reliability. A three-joint robotic arm model was tested using simulation over a 30-second period for various tasks, including pick-and-place and trajectory-following operations. The results revealed that the local reduction method reduced energy consumption by up to 25% compared to traditional techniques such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Genetic Algorithms (GA). Unlike MPC, which requires significant computational resources, and GA, which has slow convergence rates, the local reduction method demonstrated superior adaptability and computational efficiency in real-time applications. The study highlights the scalability and simplicity of the local reduction approach, making it an attractive option for industries seeking sustainable and cost-effective solutions. Additionally, this method can integrate seamlessly with emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), further enhancing its application in dynamic and complex environments. This research underscores the potential of the local reduction method as a practical tool for optimizing robotic arm operations, reducing energy demands, and contributing to sustainability in industrial automation. Future work will focus on extending the approach to real-world scenarios and incorporating AI-driven adjustments for more dynamic adaptability.

Title: Mid-infrared laser chaos lidar
Authors: Kai-Li Lin, Peng-Lei Wang, Yi-Bo Peng, Shiyu Hu, Chunfang Cao, Cheng-Ting Lee, Qian Gong, Fan-Yi Lin, Wenxiang Huang, Cheng Wang
Abstract: Chaos lidars detect targets through the cross-correlation between the back-scattered chaos signal from the target and the local reference one. Chaos lidars have excellent anti-jamming and anti-interference capabilities, owing to the random nature of chaotic oscillations. However, most chaos lidars operate in the near-infrared spectral regime, where the atmospheric attenuation is significant. Here we show a mid-infrared chaos lidar, which is suitable for long-reach ranging and imaging applications within the low-loss transmission window of the atmosphere. The proof-of-concept mid-infrared chaos lidar utilizes an interband cascade laser with optical feedback as the laser chaos source. Experimental results reveal that the chaos lidar achieves an accuracy better than 0.9 cm and a precision better than 0.3 cm for ranging distances up to 300 cm. In addition, it is found that a minimum signal-to-noise ratio of only 1 dB is required to sustain both sub-cm accuracy and sub-cm precision. This work paves the way for developing remote chaos lidar systems in the mid-infrared spectral regime.

Title: On the Analysis of Stability, Sensitivity and Transparency in Variable Admittance Control for pHRI Enhanced by Virtual Fixtures
Authors: Davide Tebaldi, Dario Onfiani, Luigi Biagiotti
Abstract: The interest in Physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI) has significantly increased over the last two decades thanks to the availability of collaborative robots that guarantee user safety during force exchanges. For this reason, stability concerns have been addressed extensively in the literature while proposing new control schemes for pHRI applications. Because of the nonlinear nature of robots, stability analyses generally leverage passivity concepts. On the other hand, the proposed algorithms generally consider ideal models of robot manipulators. For this reason, the primary objective of this paper is to conduct a detailed analysis of the sources of instability for a class of pHRI control schemes, namely proxy-based constrained admittance controllers, by considering parasitic effects such as transmission elasticity, motor velocity saturation, and actuation delay. Next, a sensitivity analysis supported by experimental results is carried out, in order to identify how the control parameters affect the stability of the overall system. Finally, an adaptation technique for the proxy parameters is proposed with the goal of maximizing transparency in pHRI. The proposed adaptation method is validated through both simulations and experimental tests.

Title: Occlusion-Aware Consistent Model Predictive Control for Robot Navigation in Occluded Obstacle-Dense Environments
Authors: Minzhe Zheng, Lei Zheng, Lei Zhu, Jun Ma
Abstract: Ensuring safety and motion consistency for robot navigation in occluded, obstacle-dense environments is a critical challenge. In this context, this study presents an occlusion-aware Consistent Model Predictive Control (CMPC) strategy. To account for the occluded obstacles, it incorporates adjustable risk regions that represent their potential future locations. Subsequently, dynamic risk boundary constraints are developed online to ensure safety. The CMPC then constructs multiple locally optimal trajectory branches (each tailored to different risk regions) to balance between exploitation and exploration. A shared consensus trunk is generated to ensure smooth transitions between branches without significant velocity fluctuations, further preserving motion consistency. To facilitate high computational efficiency and ensure coordination across local trajectories, we use the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to decompose the CMPC into manageable sub-problems for parallel solving. The proposed strategy is validated through simulation and real-world experiments on an Ackermann-steering robot platform. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CMPC strategy through comparisons with baseline approaches in occluded, obstacle-dense environments.

Title: Omnidirectional Multi-Object Tracking
Authors: Kai Luo, Hao Shi, Sheng Wu, Fei Teng, Mengfei Duan, Chang Huang, Yuhang Wang, Kaiwei Wang, Kailun Yang
Abstract: Panoramic imagery, with its 360° field of view, offers comprehensive information to support Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) in capturing spatial and temporal relationships of surrounding objects. However, most MOT algorithms are tailored for pinhole images with limited views, impairing their effectiveness in panoramic settings. Additionally, panoramic image distortions, such as resolution loss, geometric deformation, and uneven lighting, hinder direct adaptation of existing MOT methods, leading to significant performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose OmniTrack, an omnidirectional MOT framework that incorporates Tracklet Management to introduce temporal cues, FlexiTrack Instances for object localization and association, and the CircularStatE Module to alleviate image and geometric distortions. This integration enables tracking in large field-of-view scenarios, even under rapid sensor motion. To mitigate the lack of panoramic MOT datasets, we introduce the QuadTrack dataset--a comprehensive panoramic dataset collected by a quadruped robot, featuring diverse challenges such as wide fields of view, intense motion, and complex environments. Extensive experiments on the public JRDB dataset and the newly introduced QuadTrack benchmark demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed framework. OmniTrack achieves a HOTA score of 26.92% on JRDB, representing an improvement of 3.43%, and further achieves 23.45% on QuadTrack, surpassing the baseline by 6.81%. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Maestro: A 302 GFLOPS/W and 19.8GFLOPS RISC-V Vector-Tensor Architecture for Wearable Ultrasound Edge Computing
Authors: Mattia Sinigaglia, Amirhossein Kiamarzi, Marco Bertuletti, Luigi Ghionda, Mattia Orlandi, Riccardo Tedeschi, Aurora Di Giampietro, Yvan Tortorella, Luca Bertaccini, Simone Benatti, Giuseppe Tagliavini, Luca Benini, Francesco Conti, Davide Rossi
Abstract: Most Wearable Ultrasound (WUS) devices lack the computational power to process signals at the edge, instead relying on remote offload, which introduces latency, high power consumption, and privacy concerns. We present Maestro, a RISC-V SoC with unified Vector-Tensor Unit (VTU) and memory-coupled Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) accelerators targeting edge processing for wearable ultrasound devices, fabricated using low-cost TSMC 65nm CMOS technology. The VTU achieves peak 302GFLOPS/W and 19.8GFLOPS at FP16, while the multi-precision 16/32-bit floating-point FFT accelerator delivers peak 60.6GFLOPS/W and 3.6GFLOPS at FP16, We evaluate Maestro on a US-based gesture recognition task, achieving 1.62GFLOPS in signal processing at 26.68GFLOPS/W, and 19.52GFLOPS in Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) workloads at 298.03GFLOPS/W. Compared to a state-of-the-art SoC with a similar mission profile, Maestro achieves a 5x speedup while consuming only 12mW, with an energy consumption of 2.5mJ in a wearable US channel preprocessing and ML-based postprocessing pipeline.

Title: Whole-Body Model-Predictive Control of Legged Robots with MuJoCo
Authors: John Z. Zhang, Taylor A. Howell, Zeji Yi, Chaoyi Pan, Guanya Shi, Guannan Qu, Tom Erez, Yuval Tassa, Zachary Manchester
Abstract: We demonstrate the surprising real-world effectiveness of a very simple approach to whole-body model-predictive control (MPC) of quadruped and humanoid robots: the iterative LQR (iLQR) algorithm with MuJoCo dynamics and finite-difference approximated derivatives. Building upon the previous success of model-based behavior synthesis and control of locomotion and manipulation tasks with MuJoCo in simulation, we show that these policies can easily generalize to the real world with few sim-to-real considerations. Our baseline method achieves real-time whole-body MPC on a variety of hardware experiments, including dynamic quadruped locomotion, quadruped walking on two legs, and full-sized humanoid bipedal locomotion. We hope this easy-to-reproduce hardware baseline lowers the barrier to entry for real-world whole-body MPC research and contributes to accelerating research velocity in the community.

Title: When Next-Gen Sensing Meets Legacy Wi-Fi: Performance Analyses of IEEE 802.11bf and IEEE 802.11ax Coexistence
Authors: Navid Keshtiarast, Pradyumna Kumar Bishoyi, Ido Manuel Lumbantobing, Marina Petrova
Abstract: Sensing is emerging as a vital future service in next-generation wireless networks, enabling applications such as object localization and activity recognition. The IEEE 802.11bf standard extends Wi-Fi capabilities to incorporate these sensing functionalities. However, coexistence with legacy Wi-Fi in densely populated networks poses challenges, as contention for channels can impair both sensing and communication quality. This paper develops an analytical framework and a system-level simulation in ns-3 to evaluate the coexistence of IEEE 802.11bf and legacy 802.11ax in terms of sensing delay and communication throughput. Forthis purpose, we have developed a dedicated ns-3 module forIEEE 802.11bf, which is made publicly available as open-source. We provide the first coexistence analysis between IEEE 802.11bfand IEEE 802.11ax, supported by link-level simulation in ns-3to assess the impact on sensing delay and network performance. Key parameters, including sensing intervals, access categories, network densities, and antenna configurations, are systematically analyzed to understand their influence on the sensing delay and aggregated network throughput. The evaluation is further extended to a realistic indoor office environment modeled after the 3GPP TR 38.901 standard. Our findings reveal key trade-offs between sensing intervals and throughput and the need for balanced sensing parameters to ensure effective coexistence in Wi-Fi networks.

Title: Ultra-Low-Latency Edge Intelligent Sensing: A Source-Channel Tradeoff and Its Application to Coding Rate Adaptation
Authors: Qunsong Zeng, Jianhao Huang, Zhanwei Wang, Kaibin Huang, Kin K. Leung
Abstract: The forthcoming sixth-generation (6G) mobile network is set to merge edge artificial intelligence (AI) and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) extensively, giving rise to the new paradigm of edge intelligent sensing (EI-Sense). This paradigm leverages ubiquitous edge devices for environmental sensing and deploys AI algorithms at edge servers to interpret the observations via remote inference on wirelessly uploaded features. A significant challenge arises in designing EI-Sense systems for 6G mission-critical applications, which demand high performance under stringent latency constraints. To tackle this challenge, we focus on the end-to-end (E2E) performance of EI-Sense and characterize a source-channel tradeoff that balances source distortion and channel reliability. In this work, we establish a theoretical foundation for the source-channel tradeoff by quantifying the effects of source coding on feature discriminant gains and channel reliability on packet loss. Building on this foundation, we design the coding rate control by optimizing the tradeoff to minimize the E2E sensing error probability, leading to a low-complexity algorithm for ultra-low-latency EI-Sense. Finally, we validate our theoretical analysis and proposed coding rate control algorithm through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating the sensing performance gain of our approach with respect to traditional reliability-centric methods.

Title: RadIR: A Scalable Framework for Multi-Grained Medical Image Retrieval via Radiology Report Mining
Authors: Tengfei Zhang, Ziheng Zhao, Chaoyi Wu, Xiao Zhou, Ya Zhang, Yangfeng Wang, Weidi Xie
Abstract: Developing advanced medical imaging retrieval systems is challenging due to the varying definitions of `similar images' across different medical contexts. This challenge is compounded by the lack of large-scale, high-quality medical imaging retrieval datasets and benchmarks. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology that leverages dense radiology reports to define image-wise similarity ordering at multiple granularities in a scalable and fully automatic manner. Using this approach, we construct two comprehensive medical imaging retrieval datasets: MIMIC-IR for Chest X-rays and CTRATE-IR for CT scans, providing detailed image-image ranking annotations conditioned on diverse anatomical structures. Furthermore, we develop two retrieval systems, RadIR-CXR and model-ChestCT, which demonstrate superior performance in traditional image-image and image-report retrieval tasks. These systems also enable flexible, effective image retrieval conditioned on specific anatomical structures described in text, achieving state-of-the-art results on 77 out of 78 metrics.

Title: Data-Driven Distributed Optimization via Aggregative Tracking and Deep-Learning
Authors: Riccardo Brumali, Guido Carnevale, Giuseppe Notarstefano
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel distributed data-driven optimization scheme. In particular, we focus on the so-called aggregative framework, namely, the scenario in which a set of agents aim to cooperatively minimize the sum of local costs, each depending on both local decision variables and an aggregation of all of them. We consider a data-driven setup in which each objective function is unknown and can be only sampled at a single point per iteration (thanks to, e.g., feedback from human users or physical sensors). We address this scenario through a distributed algorithm that combines three key components: (i) a learning part that leverages neural networks to learn the local cost functions descent direction, (ii) an optimization routine that steers the estimates according to the learned direction to minimize the global cost, and (iii) a tracking mechanism that locally reconstructs the unavailable global quantities. By using tools from system theory, i.e., timescale separation and averaging theory, we formally prove that, in strongly convex setups, the overall distributed strategy linearly converges in a neighborhood of the optimal solution whose radius depends on the given accuracy capabilities of the neural networks. Finally, we corroborate the theoretical results with numerical simulations.

Title: Self-Supervised Models for Phoneme Recognition: Applications in Children's Speech for Reading Learning
Authors: Lucas Block Medin, Thomas Pellegrini, Lucile Gelin
Abstract: Child speech recognition is still an underdeveloped area of research due to the lack of data (especially on non-English languages) and the specific difficulties of this task. Having explored various architectures for child speech recognition in previous work, in this article we tackle recent self-supervised models. We first compare wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT and WavLM models adapted to phoneme recognition in French child speech, and continue our experiments with the best of them, WavLM base+. We then further adapt it by unfreezing its transformer blocks during fine-tuning on child speech, which greatly improves its performance and makes it significantly outperform our base model, a Transformer+CTC. Finally, we study in detail the behaviour of these two models under the real conditions of our application, and show that WavLM base+ is more robust to various reading tasks and noise levels.

Title: Full-Duplex-Bench: A Benchmark to Evaluate Full-duplex Spoken Dialogue Models on Turn-taking Capabilities
Authors: Guan-Ting Lin, Jiachen Lian, Tingle Li, Qirui Wang, Gopala Anumanchipalli, Alexander H. Liu, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: Spoken dialogue modeling introduces unique challenges beyond text-based language modeling, demanding robust turn-taking, backchanneling, and real-time interaction. Although most Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) rely on half-duplex processing (handling speech one turn at a time), emerging full-duplex SDMs can listen and speak simultaneously, enabling more natural and engaging conversations. However, current evaluations of such models remain limited, often focusing on turn-based metrics or high-level corpus analyses (e.g., turn gaps, pauses). To address this gap, we present Full-Duplex-Bench, a new benchmark that systematically evaluates key conversational behaviors: pause handling, backchanneling, turn-taking, and interruption management. Our framework uses automatic metrics for consistent and reproducible assessments of SDMs' interactive performance. By offering an open and standardized evaluation benchmark, we aim to advance spoken dialogue modeling and encourage the development of more interactive and natural dialogue systems.

Title: Controller Synthesis of Collaborative Signal Temporal Logic Tasks for Multi-Agent Systems via Assume-Guarantee Contracts
Authors: Siyuan Liu, Adnane Saoud, Dimos V. Dimarogonas
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of controller synthesis of signal temporal logic (STL) specifications for large-scale multi-agent systems, where the agents are dynamically coupled and subject to collaborative tasks. A compositional framework based on continuous-time assume-guarantee contracts is developed to break the complex and large synthesis problem into subproblems of manageable sizes. We first show how to formulate the collaborative STL tasks as assume-guarantee contracts by leveraging the idea of funnel-based control. The concept of contracts is used to establish our compositionality result, which allows us to guarantee the satisfaction of a global contract by the multi-agent system when all agents satisfy their local contracts. Then, a closed-form continuous-time feedback controller is designed to enforce local contracts over the agents in a distributed manner, which further guarantees the global task satisfaction based on the compositionality result. Finally, the effectiveness of our results is demonstrated by two numerical examples.

Title: Dynamic Scheduling of a Multiclass Queue in the Halfin-Whitt Regime: A Computational Approach for High-Dimensional Problems
Authors: Baris Ata, Ebru Kasikaralar
Abstract: We consider a multi-class queueing model of a telephone call center, in which a system manager dynamically allocates available servers to customer calls. Calls can terminate through either service completion or customer abandonment, and the manager strives to minimize the expected total of holding costs plus abandonment costs over a finite horizon. Focusing on the Halfin-Whitt heavy traffic regime, we derive an approximating diffusion control problem, and building on earlier work by Beck et al. (2021), develop a simulation-based computational method for solution of such problems, one that relies heavily on deep neural network technology. Using this computational method, we propose a policy for the original (pre-limit) call center scheduling problem. Finally, the performance of this policy is assessed using test problems based on publicly available call center data. For the test problems considered so far, our policy does as well as or better than the best benchmark we could find. Moreover, our method is computationally feasible at least up to dimension 500, that is, for call centers with 500 or more distinct customer classes.

Title: Precoder Design for User-Centric Network Massive MIMO with Matrix Manifold Optimization
Authors: Rui Sun, Li You, An-An Lu, Chen Sun, Xiqi Gao, Xiang-Gen Xia
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the precoder design for user-centric network (UCN) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) downlink with matrix manifold optimization. In UCN mMIMO systems, each user terminal (UT) is served by a subset of base stations (BSs) instead of all the BSs, facilitating the implementation of the system and lowering the dimension of the precoders to be designed. By proving that the precoder set satisfying the per-BS power constraints forms a Riemannian submanifold of a linear product manifold, we transform the constrained precoder design problem in Euclidean space to an unconstrained one on the Riemannian submanifold. Riemannian ingredients, including orthogonal projection, Riemannian gradient, retraction and vector transport, of the problem on the Riemannian submanifold are further derived, with which the Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) design method is proposed for solving the unconstrained problem. The proposed method avoids the inverses of large dimensional matrices, which is beneficial in practice. The complexity analyses show the high computational efficiency of RCG precoder design. Simulation results demonstrate the numerical superiority of the proposed precoder design and the high efficiency of the UCN mMIMO system.

Title: Learning Li-ion battery health and degradation modes from data with aging-aware circuit models
Authors: Zihao Zhou, Antti Aitio, David Howey
Abstract: Non-invasive estimation of Li-ion battery state-of-health from operational data is valuable for battery applications, but remains challenging. Pure model-based methods may suffer from inaccuracy and long-term instability of parameter estimates, whereas pure data-driven methods rely heavily on training data quality and quantity, causing lack of generality when extrapolating to unseen cases. We apply an aging-aware equivalent circuit model for health estimation, combining the flexibility of data-driven techniques within a model-based approach. A simplified electrical model with voltage source and resistor incorporates Gaussian process regression to learn capacity fade over time and also the dependence of resistance on operating conditions and time. The approach was validated against two datasets and shown to give accurate performance with less than 1% relative root mean square error (RMSE) in capacity and less than 2% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Critically, we show that the open circuit voltage versus state-of-charge function must be accurately known, and any inaccuracies or changes in this over time strongly influence the inferred resistance. However, this feature (or bug) may also be used to estimate in operando differential voltage curves from operational data.

Title: From Data to Predictive Control: A Framework for Stochastic Linear Systems with Output Measurements
Authors: Haldun Balim, Andrea Carron, Melanie N. Zeilinger, Johannes Köhler
Abstract: We introduce data to predictive control, D2PC, a framework to facilitate the design of robust and predictive controllers from data. The proposed framework is designed for discrete-time stochastic linear systems with output measurements and provides a principled design of a predictive controller based on data. The framework starts with a parameter identification method based on the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, which incorporates pre-defined structural constraints. Additionally, we provide an asymptotically correct method to quantify uncertainty in parameter estimates. Next, we develop a strategy to synthesize robust dynamic output-feedback controllers tailored to the derived uncertainty characterization. Finally, we introduce a predictive control scheme that guarantees recursive feasibility and satisfaction of chance constraints. This framework marks a significant advancement in integrating data into robust and predictive control schemes. We demonstrate the efficacy of D2PC through a numerical example involving a 10-dimensional spring-mass-damper system.

Title: Enhancing Multimodal Medical Image Classification using Cross-Graph Modal Contrastive Learning
Authors: Jun-En Ding, Chien-Chin Hsu, Chi-Hsiang Chu, Shuqiang Wang, Feng Liu
Abstract: The classification of medical images is a pivotal aspect of disease diagnosis, often enhanced by deep learning techniques. However, traditional approaches typically focus on unimodal medical image data, neglecting the integration of diverse non-image patient data. This paper proposes a novel Cross-Graph Modal Contrastive Learning (CGMCL) framework for multimodal structured data from different data domains to improve medical image classification. The model effectively integrates both image and non-image data by constructing cross-modality graphs and leveraging contrastive learning to align multimodal features in a shared latent space. An inter-modality feature scaling module further optimizes the representation learning process by reducing the gap between heterogeneous modalities. The proposed approach is evaluated on two datasets: a Parkinson's disease (PD) dataset and a public melanoma dataset. Results demonstrate that CGMCL outperforms conventional unimodal methods in accuracy, interpretability, and early disease prediction. Additionally, the method shows superior performance in multi-class melanoma classification. The CGMCL framework provides valuable insights into medical image classification while offering improved disease interpretability and predictive capabilities.

Title: Conditional Hallucinations for Image Compression
Authors: Till Aczel, Roger Wattenhofer
Abstract: In lossy image compression, models face the challenge of either hallucinating details or generating out-of-distribution samples due to the information bottleneck. This implies that at times, introducing hallucinations is necessary to generate in-distribution samples. The optimal level of hallucination varies depending on image content, as humans are sensitive to small changes that alter the semantic meaning. We propose a novel compression method that dynamically balances the degree of hallucination based on content. We collect data and train a model to predict user preferences on hallucinations. By using this prediction to adjust the perceptual weight in the reconstruction loss, we develop a Conditionally Hallucinating compression model (ConHa) that outperforms state-of-the-art image compression methods. Code and images are available at this https URL.

Title: Eavesdropping on Goal-Oriented Communication: Timing Attacks and Countermeasures
Authors: Federico Mason, Federico Chiariotti, Pietro Talli, Andrea Zanella
Abstract: Goal-oriented communication is a new paradigm that considers the meaning of transmitted information to optimize communication. One possible application is the remote monitoring of a process under communication costs: scheduling updates based on goal-oriented considerations can significantly reduce transmission frequency while maintaining high-quality tracking performance. However, goal-oriented scheduling also opens a timing-based side-channel that an eavesdropper may exploit to obtain information about the state of the remote process, even if the content of updates is perfectly secure. In this work, we study an eavesdropping attack against pull-based goal-oriented scheduling for the tracking of remote Markov processes. We provide a theoretical framework for defining the effectiveness of the attack and of possible countermeasures, as well as a practical heuristic that can provide a balance between the performance gains offered by goal-oriented communication and the information leakage.

Title: PIGUIQA: A Physical Imaging Guided Perceptual Framework for Underwater Image Quality Assessment
Authors: Weizhi Xian, Mingliang Zhou, Leong Hou U, Lang Shujun, Bin Fang, Tao Xiang, Zhaowei Shang, Weijia Jia
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Physical Imaging Guided perceptual framework for Underwater Image Quality Assessment (UIQA), termed PIGUIQA. First, we formulate UIQA as a comprehensive problem that considers the combined effects of direct transmission attenuation and backward scattering on image perception. By leveraging underwater radiative transfer theory, we systematically integrate physics-based imaging estimations to establish quantitative metrics for these distortions. Second, recognizing spatial variations in image content significance and human perceptual sensitivity to distortions, we design a module built upon a neighborhood attention mechanism for local perception of images. This module effectively captures subtle features in images, thereby enhancing the adaptive perception of distortions on the basis of local information. Third, by employing a global perceptual aggregator that further integrates holistic image scene with underwater distortion information, the proposed model accurately predicts image quality scores. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PIGUIQA achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining robust cross-dataset generalizability. The implementation is publicly available at this https URL

Title: Pitch Plane Trajectory Tracking Control for Sounding Rockets via Adaptive Feedback Linearization
Authors: Pedro dos Santos, Paulo Oliveira
Abstract: This paper proposes a pitch plane trajectory tacking control solution for suborbital launch vehicles relying on adaptive feedback linearization. Initially, the 2D dynamics and kinematics for a single-engine, thrust-vector-controlled sounding rocket are obtained for control design purposes. Then, an inner-outer control strategy, which simultaneously tackles attitude and position control, is adopted, with the inner-loop comprising the altitude and pitch control and the outer-loop addressing the horizontal (downrange) position control. Feedback linearization is used to cancel out the non-linearities in both the inner and outer dynamics. Making use of Lyapunov stability theory, an adaptation law, which provides online estimates on the inner-loop aerodynamic uncertainty, is jointly designed with the output tracking controller via adaptive backstepping, ensuring global reference tracking in the region where the feedback linearization is well-defined. The zero dynamics of the inner-stabilized system are then exploited to obtain the outerloop dynamics and derive a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) with integral action, which can stabilize them as well as reject external disturbances. In the outermost loop, the estimate on the correspondent aerodynamic uncertainty is indirectly obtained by using the inner loop estimates together with known aerodynamics relations. The resulting inner-outer position control solution is proven to be asymptotically stable in the region of interest. Using a single-stage sounding rocket, propelled by a liquid engine, as reference vehicle, different mission scenarios are tested in a simulation environment to verify the adaptability of the proposed control strategy. The system is able to track the requested trajectories while rejecting external wind disturbances. Furthermore, the need to re-tune the control gains in between different mission scenarios is minimal to none.

Title: No More Sliding Window: Efficient 3D Medical Image Segmentation with Differentiable Top-k Patch Sampling
Authors: Young Seok Jeon, Hongfei Yang, Huazhu Fu, Mengling Feng
Abstract: 3D models surpass 2D models in CT/MRI segmentation by effectively capturing inter-slice relationships. However, the added depth dimension substantially increases memory consumption. While patch-based training alleviates memory constraints, it significantly slows down the inference speed due to the sliding window (SW) approach. We propose No-More-Sliding-Window (NMSW), a novel end-to-end trainable framework that enhances the efficiency of generic 3D segmentation backbone during an inference step by eliminating the need for SW. NMSW employs a differentiable Top-k module to selectively sample only the most relevant patches, thereby minimizing redundant computations. When patch-level predictions are insufficient, the framework intelligently leverages coarse global predictions to refine results. Evaluated across 3 tasks using 3 segmentation backbones, NMSW achieves competitive accuracy compared to SW inference while significantly reducing computational complexity by 91% (88.0 to 8.00 TMACs). Moreover, it delivers a 9.1x faster inference on the H100 GPU (99.0 to 8.3 sec) and a 11.1x faster inference on the Xeon Gold CPU (2110 to 189 sec). NMSW is model-agnostic, further boosting efficiency when integrated with any existing efficient segmentation backbones.

Title: Auxiliary-Variable Adaptive Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Shuo Liu, Wei Xiao, Calin A. Belta
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of ensuring safety and feasibility in control systems using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). Existing CBF-based Quadratic Programs (CBF-QPs) often encounter feasibility issues due to mixed relative degree constraints, input nullification problems, and the presence of tight or time-varying control bounds, which can lead to infeasible solutions and compromised safety. To address these challenges, we propose Auxiliary-Variable Adaptive Control Barrier Functions (AVCBFs), a novel framework that introduces auxiliary variables in auxiliary functions to dynamically adjust CBF constraints without the need of excessive additional constraints. The AVCBF method ensures that all components of the control input explicitly appear in the desired-order safety constraint, thereby improving feasibility while maintaining safety guarantees. Additionally, we introduce an automatic tuning method that iteratively adjusts AVCBF hyperparameters to ensure feasibility and safety with less conservatism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in adaptive cruise control and obstacle avoidance scenarios, showing that AVCBFs outperform existing CBF methods by reducing infeasibility and enhancing adaptive safety control under tight or time-varying control bounds.

Title: A Reverse Mamba Attention Network for Pathological Liver Segmentation
Authors: Jun Zeng, Debesh Jha, Ertugrul Aktas, Elif Keles, Alpay Medetalibeyoglu, Matthew Antalek, Robert Lewandowski, Daniela Ladner, Amir A. Borhani, Gorkem Durak, Ulas Bagci
Abstract: We present RMA-Mamba, a novel architecture that advances the capabilities of vision state space models through a specialized reverse mamba attention module (RMA). The key innovation lies in RMA-Mamba's ability to capture long-range dependencies while maintaining precise local feature representation through its hierarchical processing pipeline. By integrating Vision Mamba (VMamba)'s efficient sequence modeling with RMA's targeted feature refinement, our architecture achieves superior feature learning across multiple scales. This dual-mechanism approach enables robust handling of complex morphological patterns while maintaining computational efficiency. We demonstrate RMA-Mamba's effectiveness in the challenging domain of pathological liver segmentation (from both CT and MRI), where traditional segmentation approaches often fail due to tissue variations. When evaluated on a newly introduced cirrhotic liver dataset (CirrMRI600+) of T2-weighted MRI scans, RMA-Mamba achieves the state-of-the-art performance with a Dice coefficient of 92.08%, mean IoU of 87.36%, and recall of 92.96%. The architecture's generalizability is further validated on the cancerous liver segmentation from CT scans (LiTS: Liver Tumor Segmentation dataset), yielding a Dice score of 92.9% and mIoU of 88.99%.

Title: LesionDiffusion: Towards Text-controlled General Lesion Synthesis
Authors: Henrui Tian, Wenhui Lei, Linrui Dai, Hanyu Chen, Xiaofan Zhang
Abstract: Fully-supervised lesion recognition methods in medical imaging face challenges due to the reliance on large annotated datasets, which are expensive and difficult to collect. To address this, synthetic lesion generation has become a promising approach. However, existing models struggle with scalability, fine-grained control over lesion attributes, and the generation of complex structures. We propose LesionDiffusion, a text-controllable lesion synthesis framework for 3D CT imaging that generates both lesions and corresponding masks. By utilizing a structured lesion report template, our model provides greater control over lesion attributes and supports a wider variety of lesion types. We introduce a dataset of 1,505 annotated CT scans with paired lesion masks and structured reports, covering 14 lesion types across 8 organs. LesionDiffusion consists of two components: a lesion mask synthesis network (LMNet) and a lesion inpainting network (LINet), both guided by lesion attributes and image features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LesionDiffusion significantly improves segmentation performance, with strong generalization to unseen lesion types and organs, outperforming current state-of-the-art models. Code will be available at this https URL.

Title: Tracking Control of Euler-Lagrangian Systems with Prescribed State, Input, and Temporal Constraints
Authors: Chidre Shravista Kashyap, Pushpak Jagtap, Jishnu Keshavan
Abstract: The synthesis of a smooth tracking control policy for Euler-Lagrangian (EL) systems with stringent regions of operation induced by state, input and temporal (SIT) constraints is a very challenging task. In contrast with existing methods that utilize prior knowledge of EL model parameters and uncertainty bounds, this study proposes an approximation-free adaptive barrier function-based control policy to ensure local prescribed time convergence of tracking error under state and input constraints. The proposed control policy accomplishes this by utilizing smooth time-based generator functions embedded in the filtered tracking error, which is combined with a saturation function that limits control action and confines states within the prescribed limits by enforcing the time-varying bounds on the filtered tracking error. Importantly, corresponding feasibility conditions pertaining to the minimum control authority, maximum disturbance rejection capability of the control policy, and the viable set of initial conditions are derived, illuminating the narrow operating domain of the EL systems arising from the interplay of SIT constraints. Numerical validation studies with three different robotic manipulators are employed to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme. A detailed performance comparison study with leading alternative designs is also undertaken to illustrate the superior performance of the proposed scheme.

Title: OrbID: Identifying Orbcomm Satellite RF Fingerprints
Authors: Cédric Solenthaler, Joshua Smailes, Martin Strohmeier
Abstract: An increase in availability of Software Defined Radios (SDRs) has caused a dramatic shift in the threat landscape of legacy satellite systems, opening them up to easy spoofing attacks by low-budget adversaries. Physical-layer authentication methods can help improve the security of these systems by providing additional validation without modifying the space segment. This paper extends previous research on Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF) of satellite communication to the Orbcomm satellite formation. The GPS and Iridium constellations are already well covered in prior research, but the feasibility of transferring techniques to other formations has not yet been examined, and raises previously undiscussed challenges. In this paper, we collect a novel dataset containing 8992474 packets from the Orbcom satellite constellation using different SDRs and locations. We use this dataset to train RFF systems based on convolutional neural networks. We achieve an ROC AUC score of 0.53 when distinguishing different satellites within the constellation, and 0.98 when distinguishing legitimate satellites from SDRs in a spoofing scenario. We also demonstrate the possibility of mixing datasets using different SDRs in different physical locations.

Title: Intermediate Domain-guided Adaptation for Unsupervised Chorioallantoic Membrane Vessel Segmentation
Authors: Pengwu Song, Liang Xu, Peng Yao, Shuwei Shen, Pengfei Shao, Mingzhai Sun, Ronald X. Xu
Abstract: The chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model is widely employed in angiogenesis research, and distribution of growing blood vessels is the key evaluation indicator. As a result, vessel segmentation is crucial for quantitative assessment based on topology and morphology. However, manual segmentation is extremely time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to inconsistency due to its subjective nature. Moreover, research on CAM vessel segmentation algorithms remains limited, and the lack of public datasets contributes to poor prediction performance. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative Intermediate Domain-guided Adaptation (IDA) method, which utilizes the similarity between CAM images and retinal images, along with existing public retinal datasets, to perform unsupervised training on CAM images. Specifically, we introduce a Multi-Resolution Asymmetric Translation (MRAT) strategy to generate intermediate images to promote image-level interaction. Then, an Intermediate Domain-guided Contrastive Learning (IDCL) module is developed to disentangle cross-domain feature representations. This method overcomes the limitations of existing unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approaches, which primarily concentrate on directly source-target alignment while neglecting intermediate domain information. Notably, we create the first CAM dataset to validate the proposed algorithm. Extensive experiments on this dataset show that our method outperforms compared approaches. Moreover, it achieves superior performance in UDA tasks across retinal datasets, highlighting its strong generalization capability. The CAM dataset and source codes are available at this https URL.

Title: Introduction to Online Control
Authors: Elad Hazan, Karan Singh
Abstract: This text presents an introduction to an emerging paradigm in control of dynamical systems and differentiable reinforcement learning called online nonstochastic control. The new approach applies techniques from online convex optimization and convex relaxations to obtain new methods with provable guarantees for classical settings in optimal and robust control. The primary distinction between online nonstochastic control and other frameworks is the objective. In optimal control, robust control, and other control methodologies that assume stochastic noise, the goal is to perform comparably to an offline optimal strategy. In online nonstochastic control, both the cost functions as well as the perturbations from the assumed dynamical model are chosen by an adversary. Thus the optimal policy is not defined a priori. Rather, the target is to attain low regret against the best policy in hindsight from a benchmark class of policies. This objective suggests the use of the decision making framework of online convex optimization as an algorithmic methodology. The resulting methods are based on iterative mathematical optimization algorithms, and are accompanied by finite-time regret and computational complexity guarantees.

Title: Autonomous RISs and Oblivious Base Stations: The Observer Effect and its Mitigation
Authors: Victor Croisfelt, Francesco Devoti, Fabio Saggese, Vincenzo Sciancalepore, Xavier Costa-Pérez, Petar Popovski
Abstract: Autonomous reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer the potential to simplify deployment by reducing the need for real-time remote control between a base station (BS) and an RIS. However, we highlight two major challenges posed by autonomy. The first is implementation complexity, as autonomy requires hybrid RISs (HRISs) equipped with additional onboard hardware to monitor the propagation environment and perform local channel estimation (CHEST), a process known as probing. The second challenge, termed probe distortion, reflects a form of the observer effect: during probing, an HRIS can inadvertently alter the propagation environment, potentially disrupting the operations of other communicating devices sharing the environment. Although implementation complexity has been extensively studied, probe distortion remains largely unexplored. To further assess the potential of autonomous RIS, this paper comprehensively and pragmatically studies the fundamental trade-offs posed by these challenges collectively. In particular, we examine the robustness of an HRIS-assisted massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system by considering its critical components and stringent conditions. The latter include: (a) two extremes of implementation complexity, represented by minimalist operation designs of two distinct HRIS hardware architectures, and (b) an oblivious BS that fully embraces probe distortion. To make our analysis possible, we propose a physical-layer orchestration framework that aligns HRIS and mMIMO operations. We present empirical evidence that autonomous RISs remain promising under stringent conditions and outline research directions to deepen probe distortion understanding.

Title: Unifying Multitrack Music Arrangement via Reconstruction Fine-Tuning and Efficient Tokenization
Authors: Longshen Ou, Jingwei Zhao, Ziyu Wang, Gus Xia, Ye Wang
Abstract: Automatic music arrangement streamlines the creation of musical variants for composers and arrangers, reducing reliance on extensive music expertise. However, existing methods suffer from inefficient tokenization, underutilization of pre-trained music language models (LMs), and suboptimal fidelity and coherence in generated arrangements. This paper introduces an efficient multitrack music tokenizer for unconditional and conditional symbolic music generation, along with a unified sequence-to-sequence reconstruction fine-tuning objective for pre-trained music LMs that balances task-specific needs with coherence constraints. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on band arrangement, piano reduction, and drum arrangement, surpassing task-specific models in both objective metrics and perceptual quality. Additionally, we demonstrate that generative pretraining significantly contributes to the performance across these arrangement tasks, especially when handling long segments with complex alignment.

Title: MusicMamba: A Dual-Feature Modeling Approach for Generating Chinese Traditional Music with Modal Precision
Authors: Jiatao Chen, Tianming Xie, Xing Tang, Jing Wang, Wenjing Dong, Bing Shi
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has significantly advanced the MIDI domain, solidifying music generation as a key application of artificial intelligence. However, existing research primarily focuses on Western music and encounters challenges in generating melodies for Chinese traditional music, especially in capturing modal characteristics and emotional expression. To address these issues, we propose a new architecture, the Dual-Feature Modeling Module, which integrates the long-range dependency modeling of the Mamba Block with the global structure capturing capabilities of the Transformer Block. Additionally, we introduce the Bidirectional Mamba Fusion Layer, which integrates local details and global structures through bidirectional scanning, enhancing the modeling of complex sequences. Building on this architecture, we propose the REMI-M representation, which more accurately captures and generates modal information in melodies. To support this research, we developed FolkDB, a high-quality Chinese traditional music dataset encompassing various styles and totaling over 11 hours of music. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed architecture excels in generating melodies with Chinese traditional music characteristics, offering a new and effective solution for music generation.

Title: Adapting Gait Frequency for Posture-regulating Humanoid Push-recovery via Hierarchical Model Predictive Control
Authors: Junheng Li, Zhanhao Le, Junchao Ma, Quan Nguyen
Abstract: Current humanoid push-recovery strategies often use whole-body motion, yet they tend to overlook posture regulation. For instance, in manipulation tasks, the upper body may need to stay upright and have minimal recovery displacement. This paper introduces a novel approach to enhancing humanoid push-recovery performance under unknown disturbances and regulating body posture by tailoring the recovery stepping strategy. We propose a hierarchical-MPC-based scheme that analyzes and detects instability in the prediction window and quickly recovers through adapting gait frequency. Our approach integrates a high-level nonlinear MPC, a posture-aware gait frequency adaptation planner, and a low-level convex locomotion MPC. The planners predict the center of mass (CoM) state trajectories that can be assessed for precursors of potential instability and posture deviation. In simulation, we demonstrate improved maximum recoverable impulse by 131% on average compared with baseline approaches. In hardware experiments, a 125 ms advancement in recovery stepping timing/reflex has been observed with the proposed approach. We also demonstrate improved push-recovery performance and minimized body attitude change under 0.2 rad.

Title: iWalker: Imperative Visual Planning for Walking Humanoid Robot
Authors: Xiao Lin, Yuhao Huang, Taimeng Fu, Xiaobin Xiong, Chen Wang
Abstract: Humanoid robots, designed to operate in human-centric environments, serve as a fundamental platform for a broad range of tasks. Although humanoid robots have been extensively studied for decades, a majority of existing humanoid robots still heavily rely on complex modular frameworks, leading to inflexibility and potential compounded errors from independent sensing, planning, and acting components. In response, we propose an end-to-end humanoid sense-plan-act walking system, enabling vision-based obstacle avoidance and footstep planning for whole body balancing simultaneously. We designed two imperative learning (IL)-based bilevel optimizations for model-predictive step planning and whole body balancing, respectively, to achieve self-supervised learning for humanoid robot walking. This enables the robot to learn from arbitrary unlabeled data, improving its adaptability and generalization capabilities. We refer to our method as iWalker and demonstrate its effectiveness in both simulated and real-world environments, representing a significant advancement toward autonomous humanoid robots.

Title: TIGER: Time-frequency Interleaved Gain Extraction and Reconstruction for Efficient Speech Separation
Authors: Mohan Xu, Kai Li, Guo Chen, Xiaolin Hu
Abstract: In recent years, much speech separation research has focused primarily on improving model performance. However, for low-latency speech processing systems, high efficiency is equally important. Therefore, we propose a speech separation model with significantly reduced parameters and computational costs: Time-frequency Interleaved Gain Extraction and Reconstruction network (TIGER). TIGER leverages prior knowledge to divide frequency bands and compresses frequency information. We employ a multi-scale selective attention module to extract contextual features while introducing a full-frequency-frame attention module to capture both temporal and frequency contextual information. Additionally, to more realistically evaluate the performance of speech separation models in complex acoustic environments, we introduce a dataset called EchoSet. This dataset includes noise and more realistic reverberation (e.g., considering object occlusions and material properties), with speech from two speakers overlapping at random proportions. Experimental results showed that models trained on EchoSet had better generalization ability than those trained on other datasets compared to the data collected in the physical world, which validated the practical value of the EchoSet. On EchoSet and real-world data, TIGER significantly reduces the number of parameters by 94.3% and the MACs by 95.3% while achieving performance surpassing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model TF-GridNet.

Title: SonicSim: A customizable simulation platform for speech processing in moving sound source scenarios
Authors: Kai Li, Wendi Sang, Chang Zeng, Runxuan Yang, Guo Chen, Xiaolin Hu
Abstract: Systematic evaluation of speech separation and enhancement models under moving sound source conditions requires extensive and diverse data. However, real-world datasets often lack sufficient data for training and evaluation, and synthetic datasets, while larger, lack acoustic realism. Consequently, neither effectively meets practical needs. To address this issue, we introduce SonicSim, a synthetic toolkit based on the embodied AI simulation platform Habitat-sim, designed to generate highly customizable data for moving sound sources. SonicSim supports multi-level adjustments, including scene-level, microphone-level, and source-level adjustments, enabling the creation of more diverse synthetic data. Leveraging SonicSim, we constructed a benchmark dataset called SonicSet, utilizing LibriSpeech, Freesound Dataset 50k (FSD50K), Free Music Archive (FMA), and 90 scenes from Matterport3D to evaluate speech separation and enhancement models. Additionally, to investigate the differences between synthetic and real-world data, we selected 5 hours of raw, non-reverberant data from the SonicSet validation set and recorded a real-world speech separation dataset, providing a reference for comparing SonicSet with other synthetic datasets. For speech enhancement, we utilized the real-world dataset RealMAN to validate the acoustic gap between SonicSet and existing synthetic datasets. The results indicate that models trained on SonicSet generalize better to real-world scenarios compared to other synthetic datasets. The code is publicly available at this https URL.

Title: A Data-Driven Aggressive Autonomous Racing Framework Utilizing Local Trajectory Planning with Velocity Prediction
Authors: Zhouheng Li, Bei Zhou, Cheng Hu, Lei Xie, Hongye Su
Abstract: The development of autonomous driving has boosted the research on autonomous racing. However, existing local trajectory planning methods have difficulty planning trajectories with optimal velocity profiles at racetracks with sharp corners, thus weakening the performance of autonomous racing. To address this problem, we propose a local trajectory planning method that integrates Velocity Prediction based on Model Predictive Contouring Control (VPMPCC). The optimal parameters of VPMPCC are learned through Bayesian Optimization (BO) based on a proposed novel Objective Function adapted to Racing (OFR). Specifically, VPMPCC achieves velocity prediction by encoding the racetrack as a reference velocity profile and incorporating it into the optimization problem. This method optimizes the velocity profile of local trajectories, especially at corners with significant curvature. The proposed OFR balances racing performance with vehicle safety, ensuring safe and efficient BO training. In the simulation, the number of training iterations for OFR-based BO is reduced by 42.86% compared to the state-of-the-art method. The optimal simulation-trained parameters are then applied to a real-world F1TENTH vehicle without retraining. During prolonged racing on a custom-built racetrack featuring significant sharp corners, the mean projected velocity of VPMPCC reaches 93.18% of the vehicle's handling limits. The released code is available at this https URL.

Authors: Ayato Kanada, Ryo Takahashi, Keito Hayashi, Ryusuke Hosaka, Wakako Yukita, Yasutaka Nakashima, Tomoyuki Yokota, Takao Someya, Mitsuhiro Kamezaki, Yoshihiro Kawahara, Motoji Yamamoto
Abstract: Bio-inspired multi-joint snake robots offer the advantages of terrain adaptability due to their limbless structure and high flexibility. However, a series of dozens of motor units in typical multiple-joint snake robots results in a heavy body structure and hundreds of watts of high power consumption. This paper presents a joint-repositionable, inner-wireless snake robot that enables multi-joint-like locomotion using a low-powered underactuated mechanism. The snake robot, consisting of a series of flexible passive links, can dynamically change its joint coupling configuration by repositioning motor-driven joint units along rack gears inside the robot. Additionally, a soft robot skin wirelessly powers the internal joint units, avoiding the risk of wire tangling and disconnection caused by the movable joint units. The combination of the joint-repositionable mechanism and the wireless-charging-enabled soft skin achieves a high degree of bending, along with a lightweight structure of 1.3 kg and energy-efficient wireless power transmission of 7.6 watts.

Title: Parallel-in-Time Kalman Smoothing Using Orthogonal Transformations
Authors: Shahaf Gargir, Sivan Toledo
Abstract: We present a numerically-stable parallel-in-time linear Kalman smoother. The smoother uses a novel highly-parallel QR factorization for a class of structured sparse matrices for state estimation, and an adaptation of the SelInv selective-inversion algorithm to evaluate the covariance matrices of estimated states. Our implementation of the new algorithm, using the Threading Building Blocks (TBB) library, scales well on both Intel and ARM multi-core servers, achieving speedups of up to 47x on 64 cores. The algorithm performs more arithmetic than sequential smoothers; consequently it is 1.8x to 2.5x slower on a single core. The new algorithm is faster and scales better than the parallel Kalman smoother proposed by Särkkä and Garc\'ıa-Fernández in 2021.

Title: DTU-Net: A Multi-Scale Dilated Transformer Network for Nonlinear Hyperspectral Unmixing
Authors: ChenTong Wang, Jincheng Gao, Fei Zhu, Abderrahim Halimi, Cédric Richard
Abstract: Transformers have shown significant success in hyperspectral unmixing (HU). However, challenges remain. While multi-scale and long-range spatial correlations are essential in unmixing tasks, current Transformer-based unmixing networks, built on Vision Transformer (ViT) or Swin-Transformer, struggle to capture them effectively. Additionally, current Transformer-based unmixing networks rely on the linear mixing model, which lacks the flexibility to accommodate scenarios where nonlinear effects are significant. To address these limitations, we propose a multi-scale Dilated Transformer-based unmixing network for nonlinear HU (DTU-Net). The encoder employs two branches. The first one performs multi-scale spatial feature extraction using Multi-Scale Dilated Attention (MSDA) in the Dilated Transformer, which varies dilation rates across attention heads to capture long-range and multi-scale spatial correlations. The second one performs spectral feature extraction utilizing 3D-CNNs with channel attention. The outputs from both branches are then fused to integrate multi-scale spatial and spectral information, which is subsequently transformed to estimate the abundances. The decoder is designed to accommodate both linear and nonlinear mixing scenarios. Its interpretability is enhanced by explicitly modeling the relationships between endmembers, abundances, and nonlinear coefficients in accordance with the polynomial post-nonlinear mixing model (PPNMM). Experiments on synthetic and real datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed DTU-Net compared to PPNMM-derived methods and several advanced unmixing networks.

Abstract: Traffic simulation is essential for autonomous vehicle (AV) development, enabling comprehensive safety evaluation across diverse driving conditions. However, traditional rule-based simulators struggle to capture complex human interactions, while data-driven approaches often fail to maintain long-term behavioral realism or generate diverse safety-critical events. To address these challenges, we propose TeraSim, an open-source, high-fidelity traffic simulation platform designed to uncover unknown unsafe events and efficiently estimate AV statistical performance metrics, such as crash rates. TeraSim is designed for seamless integration with third-party physics simulators and standalone AV stacks, to construct a complete AV simulation system. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in generating diverse safety-critical events involving both static and dynamic agents, identifying hidden deficiencies in AV systems, and enabling statistical performance evaluation. These findings highlight TeraSim's potential as a practical tool for AV safety assessment, benefiting researchers, developers, and policymakers. The code is available at this https URL.
