Title: Adaptive Deadlock Avoidance for Decentralized Multi-agent Systems via CBF-inspired Risk Measurement
Authors: Yanze Zhang, Yiwei Lyu, Siwon Jo, Yupeng Yang, Wenhao Luo
Abstract: Decentralized safe control plays an important role in multi-agent systems given the scalability and robustness without reliance on a central authority. However, without an explicit global coordinator, the decentralized control methods are often prone to deadlock -- a state where the system reaches equilibrium, causing the robots to stall. In this paper, we propose a generalized decentralized framework that unifies the Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) and Control Barrier Function (CBF) to facilitate efficient task execution and ensure deadlock-free trajectories for the multi-agent systems. As the agents approach the deadlock-related undesirable equilibrium, the framework can detect the equilibrium and drive agents away before that happens. This is achieved by a secondary deadlock resolution design with an auxiliary CBF to prevent the multi-agent systems from converging to the undesirable equilibrium. To avoid dominating effects due to the deadlock resolution over the original task-related controllers, a deadlock indicator function using CBF-inspired risk measurement is proposed and encoded in the unified framework for the agents to adaptively determine when to activate the deadlock resolution. This allows the agents to follow their original control tasks and seamlessly unlock or deactivate deadlock resolution as necessary, effectively improving task efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and real-world experiments.

Title: Dynamics-Invariant Quadrotor Control using Scale-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Varad Vaidya, Jishnu Keshavan
Abstract: Due to dynamic variations such as changing payload, aerodynamic disturbances, and varying platforms, a robust solution for quadrotor trajectory tracking remains challenging. To address these challenges, we present a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that achieves physical dynamics invariance by directly optimizing force/torque inputs, eliminating the need for traditional intermediate control layers. Our architecture integrates a temporal trajectory encoder, which processes finite-horizon reference positions/velocities, with a latent dynamics encoder trained on historical state-action pairs to model platform-specific characteristics. Additionally, we introduce scale-aware dynamics randomization parameterized by the quadrotor's arm length, enabling our approach to maintain stability across drones spanning from 30g to 2.1kg and outperform other DRL baselines by 85% in tracking accuracy. Extensive real-world validation of our approach on the Crazyflie 2.1 quadrotor, encompassing over 200 flights, demonstrates robust adaptation to wind, ground effects, and swinging payloads while achieving less than 0.05m RMSE at speeds up to 2.0 m/s. This work introduces a universal quadrotor control paradigm that compensates for dynamic discrepancies across varied conditions and scales, paving the way for more resilient aerial systems.

Title: APECS: Adaptive Personalized Control System Architecture
Authors: Marius F. R. Juston, Alex Gisi, William R. Norris, Dustin Nottage, Ahmet Soylemezoglu
Abstract: This paper presents the Adaptive Personalized Control System (APECS) architecture, a novel framework for human-in-the-loop control. An architecture is developed which defines appropriate constraints for the system objectives. A method for enacting Lipschitz and sector bounds on the resulting controller is derived to ensure desirable control properties. An analysis of worst-case loss functions and the optimal loss function weighting is made to implement an effective training scheme. Finally, simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. This architecture resulted in a 4.5% performance increase compared to the human operator and 9% to an unconstrained feedforward neural network trained in the same way.

Title: Optimizing AUV speed dynamics with a data-driven Koopman operator approach
Authors: Zhiliang Liu, Xin Zhao, Peng Cai, Bing Cong
Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) play an essential role in modern ocean exploration, and their speed control systems are fundamental to their efficient operation. Like many other robotic systems, AUVs exhibit multivariable nonlinear dynamics and face various constraints, including state limitations, input constraints, and constraints on the increment input, making controller design challenging and requiring significant effort and time. This paper addresses these challenges by employing a data-driven Koopman operator theory combined with Model Predictive Control (MPC), which takes into account the aforementioned constraints. The proposed approach not only ensures the performance of the AUV under state and input limitations but also considers the variation in incremental input to prevent rapid and potentially damaging changes to the vehicle's operation. Additionally, we develop a platform based on ROS2 and Gazebo to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, providing new control strategies for underwater vehicles against the complex and dynamic nature of underwater environments.

Title: Rel-UNet: Reliable Tumor Segmentation via Uncertainty Quantification in nnU-Net
Authors: Seyed Sina Ziaee, Farhad Maleki, Katie Ovens
Abstract: Accurate and reliable tumor segmentation is essential in medical imaging analysis for improving diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring. However, existing segmentation models often lack robust mechanisms for quantifying the uncertainty associated with their predictions, which is essential for informed clinical decision-making. This study presents a novel approach for uncertainty quantification in kidney tumor segmentation using deep learning, specifically leveraging multiple local minima during training. Our method generates uncertainty maps without modifying the original model architecture or requiring extensive computational resources. We evaluated our approach on the KiTS23 dataset, where our approach effectively identified ambiguous regions faster and with lower uncertainty scores in contrast to previous approaches. The generated uncertainty maps provide critical insights into model confidence, ultimately enhancing the reliability of the segmentation with the potential to support more accurate medical diagnoses. The computational efficiency and model-agnostic design of the proposed approach allows adaptation without architectural changes, enabling use across various segmentation models.

Title: 4D-ACFNet: A 4D Attention Mechanism-Based Prognostic Framework for Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastasis Integrating Multimodal Spatiotemporal Features
Authors: Zesheng Li, Wei Yang, Yan Su, Yiran Zhu, Yuhan Tang, Haoran Chen, Chengchang Pan, Honggang Qi
Abstract: Postoperative prognostic prediction for colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity, dynamic evolution of the hepatic microenvironment, and insufficient multimodal data fusion. To address these issues, we propose 4D-ACFNet, the first framework that synergistically integrates lightweight spatiotemporal modeling, cross-modal dynamic calibration, and personalized temporal prediction within a unified architecture. Specifically, it incorporates a novel 4D spatiotemporal attention mechanism, which employs spatiotemporal separable convolution (reducing parameter count by 41%) and virtual timestamp encoding to model the interannual evolution patterns of postoperative dynamic processes, such as liver regeneration and steatosis. For cross-modal feature alignment, Transformer layers are integrated to jointly optimize modality alignment loss and disentanglement loss, effectively suppressing scale mismatch and redundant interference in clinical-imaging data. Additionally, we design a dynamic prognostic decision module that generates personalized interannual recurrence risk heatmaps through temporal upsampling and a gated classification head, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods in temporal dynamic modeling and cross-modal alignment. Experiments on 197 CRLM patients demonstrate that the model achieves 100% temporal adjacency accuracy (TAA), with performance significantly surpassing existing approaches. This study establishes the first spatiotemporal modeling paradigm for postoperative dynamic monitoring of CRLM. The proposed framework can be extended to prognostic analysis of multi-cancer metastases, advancing precision surgery from "spatial resection" to "spatiotemporal cure."

Title: Stochastic Geometry for Modeling and Analysis of Sensing and Communications: A Survey
Authors: Harris K. Armeniakos, Petros S. Bithas, Sotiris A. Tegos, Athanasios G. Kanatas, George K. Karagiannidis
Abstract: One of the most promising technologies for next-generation wireless networks is integrated communication and sensing (ISAC). It is considered a key enabler for applications that require both enhanced communication and accurate sensing capabilities. Examples of such applications include smart environments, augmented and virtual reality, or the internet of things, where the capabilities of intelligent sensing and broadband communications are vital. Therefore, ISAC has attracted the research interest of both academia and industry, and many investigations have been carried out over the past decade. The articles in the literature include system models, performance evaluation, and optimization studies of several ISAC alternative designs. Stochastic geometry is the study and analysis of random spatial patterns, and as such, stochastic geometry tools have been considered for the performance evaluation of wireless networks with different types of nodes. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive survey of current research progress in performance evaluation of ISAC systems using stochastic geometry tools. The survey covers terrestrial, aerial, and vehicular networks, where the random spatial location of the corresponding network elements and propagation scatterers and/or blockages is treated with various point processes. The paper starts with a short tutorial on ISAC technology, stochastic geometry tools, and metrics used in performance evaluation of communication and sensing. Then, the technical components of the system models utilized in the surveyed papers are discussed. Subsequently, we present the key results of the literature in all types of networks using three levels of integration: sensing-assisted communication, communication-assisted sensing, and joint sensing and communication. Finally, future research challenges and promising directions are discussed.

Title: T-Parameters Based Modeling for Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces: Tractable and Physically Consistent Model
Authors: Hamad Yahya, Matteo Nerini, Bruno Clerckx, Merouane Debbah
Abstract: This work develops a physically consistent model for stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) using multiport network theory and transfer scattering parameters (T-parameters). Unlike the scattering parameters (S-parameters) model, which is highly complex and non-tractable due to its nested nature and excessive number of matrix inversions, the developed T-parameters model is less complex and more tractable due to its explicit and compact nature. This work further derives the constraints of T-parameters for a lossless reciprocal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). A gradient descent algorithm (GDA) is proposed to maximize the sum rate in SIM-aided multiuser scenarios, and the results show that accounting for mutual coupling and feedback between consecutive layers can improve the sum rate. In addition, increasing the number of SIM layers with a fixed total number of elements degrades the sum rate when our exact and simplified channel models are used, unlike the simplified channel model with the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction coefficients which improves the sum rate.

Title: Digital resampling using Farrow structures
Authors: N. V. Bakholdin, V. A. Chernienko, S. A. Bakhurin
Abstract: Farrow filters allow to develop universal oversamplers for fractional delay correction and sampling rate conversion. The use of cubic Lagrangian interpolation in Farrow filter does not allow to provide processing bandwidth more than 0.4 of sampling frequency, and also does not guarantee smoothness of impulse response of the interpolator. In this paper, we propose Farrow filter structures based on 3rd, 5th and 7th order Hermite splines using a high order differentiator. The proposed filters increase the processing bandwidth up to 0.8 of sampling frequency by increasing the order of the polynomial with additional constraints on the continuity of the derivatives at the interpolation nodes.

Title: Bidirectional Learned Facial Animation Codec for Low Bitrate Talking Head Videos
Authors: Riku Takahashi, Ryugo Morita, Fuma Kimishima, Kosuke Iwama, Jinjia Zhou
Abstract: Existing deep facial animation coding techniques efficiently compress talking head videos by applying deep generative models. Instead of compressing the entire video sequence, these methods focus on compressing only the keyframe and the keypoints of non-keyframes (target frames). The target frames are then reconstructed by utilizing a single keyframe, and the keypoints of the target frame. Although these unidirectional methods can reduce the bitrate, they rely on a single keyframe and often struggle to capture large head movements accurately, resulting in distortions in the facial region. In this paper, we propose a novel bidirectional learned animation codec that generates natural facial videos using past and future keyframes. First, in the Bidirectional Reference-Guided Auxiliary Stream Enhancement (BRG-ASE) process, we introduce a compact auxiliary stream for non-keyframes, which is enhanced by adaptively selecting one of two keyframes (past and future). This stream improves video quality with a slight increase in bitrate. Then, in the Bidirectional Reference-Guided Video Reconstruction (BRG-VRec) process, we animate the adaptively selected keyframe and reconstruct the target frame using both the animated keyframe and the auxiliary frame. Extensive experiments demonstrate a 55% bitrate reduction compared to the latest animation based video codec, and a 35% bitrate reduction compared to the latest video coding standard, Versatile Video Coding (VVC) on a talking head video dataset. It showcases the efficiency of our approach in improving video quality while simultaneously decreasing bitrate.

Title: Model-Agnostic Uncertainty Quantification for Fast NFC Tag Identification using RF Fingerprinting
Authors: Dickson Akuoko Sarpong, Adam Kamrath, Rohit Bhusal, Hongzhi Guo
Abstract: Near Field Communication (NFC) is widely used in security applications such as door access systems and ID cards. However, clone attacks can replicate digital information, enabling unauthorized access. RF fingerprinting offers a robust defense by extracting unique physical-layer features from NFC cards that cannot be cloned. While RF fingerprinting has been extensively applied to Internet of Things (IoT) device authentication, NFC tags present distinct characteristics that require specialized approaches. This paper focuses on RF fingerprinting for the ISO15693 NFC tag, which is a widely used international standard, by leveraging multi-channel, multi-rate data sampling to enhance accuracy. Deep learning and Random Forest models are employed to identify NFC tags, while uncertainty quantification, particularly Conformal Prediction, accelerates the identification process with high confidence and precision. A software-defined radio (SDR) testbed is developed to transmit customized commands and collect multi-channel multi-rate NFC signals. The multi-channel multi-rate NFC signals are progressively collected to ensure fast and accurate identification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves high accuracy by adaptively utilizing the optimal combination of NFC signals. The developed solution is model-agnostic which can be utilized for any machine learning-based NFC tag identification.

Title: Data-Driven Distributionally Robust Control for Interacting Agents under Logical Constraints
Authors: Arash Bahari Kordabad, Eleftherios E. Vlahakis, Lars Lindemann, Sebastien Gros, Dimos V. Dimarogonas, Sadegh Soudjani
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a distributionally robust control synthesis for an agent with stochastic dynamics that interacts with other agents under uncertainties and constraints expressed by signal temporal logic (STL). We formulate the control synthesis as a chance-constrained program (CCP) with STL specifications that must be satisfied with high probability under all uncertainty tubes induced by the other agents. To tackle the CCP, we propose two methods based on concentration of measure (CoM) theory and conditional value at risk (CVaR) and compare the required assumptions and resulting optimizations. These approaches convert the CCP into an expectation-constrained program (ECP), which is simpler to solve than the original CCP. To estimate the expectation using a finite set of observed data, we adopt a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) approach. The underlying DRO can be approximated as a robust data-driven optimization that provides a probabilistic under-approximation to the original ECP, where the probability depends on the number of samples. Therefore, under feasibility, the original STL constraints are satisfied with two layers of designed confidence: the confidence of the chance constraint and the confidence of the approximated data-driven optimization, which depends on the number of samples. We then provide details on solving the resulting robust data-driven optimization numerically. Finally, we compare the two proposed approaches through case studies.

Title: Identification and Classification of Human Performance related Challenges during Remote Driving
Authors: Ole Hans, Jürgen Adamy
Abstract: Remote driving of vehicles is gaining in importance in the transportation sector, especially when Automated Driving Systems (ADSs) reach the limits of their system boundaries. This study investigates the challenges faced by human Remote Drivers (RDs) during remote driving, particularly focusing on the identification and classification of human performance-related challenges through a comprehensive analysis of real-world remote driving data Las Vegas. For this purpose, a total of 183 RD performance-related Safety Driver (SD) interventions were analyzed and classified using an introduced severity classification. As it is essential to prevent the need for SD interventions, this study identified and analyzed harsh driving events to detect an increased likelihood of interventions by the SD. In addition, the results of the subjective RD questionnaire are used to evaluate whether the objective metrics from SD interventions and harsh driving events can also be confirmed by the RDs and whether additional challenges can be uncovered. The analysis reveals learning curves, showing a significant decrease in SD interventions as RD experience increases. Early phases of remote driving experience, especially below 200 km of experience, showed the highest frequency of safety-related events, including braking too late for traffic signs and responding impatiently to other traffic participants. Over time, RDs follow defined rules for improving their control, with experience leading to less harsh braking, acceleration, and steering maneuvers. The study contributes to understanding the requirements of RDS, emphasizing the importance of targeted training to address human performance limitations. It further highlights the need for system improvements to address challenges like latency and the limited haptic feedback replaced by visual feedback, which affect the RDs' perception and vehicle control.

Title: QuickDraw: Fast Visualization, Analysis and Active Learning for Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Daniel Syomichev, Padmini Gopinath, Guang-Lin Wei, Eric Chang, Ian Gordon, Amanuel Seifu, Rahul Pemmaraju, Neehar Peri, James Purtilo
Abstract: Analyzing CT scans, MRIs and X-rays is pivotal in diagnosing and treating diseases. However, detecting and identifying abnormalities from such medical images is a time-intensive process that requires expert analysis and is prone to interobserver variability. To mitigate such issues, machine learning-based models have been introduced to automate and significantly reduce the cost of image segmentation. Despite significant advances in medical image analysis in recent years, many of the latest models are never applied in clinical settings because state-of-the-art models do not easily interface with existing medical image viewers. To address these limitations, we propose QuickDraw, an open-source framework for medical image visualization and analysis that allows users to upload DICOM images and run off-the-shelf models to generate 3D segmentation masks. In addition, our tool allows users to edit, export, and evaluate segmentation masks to iteratively improve state-of-the-art models through active learning. In this paper, we detail the design of our tool and present survey results that highlight the usability of our software. Notably, we find that QuickDraw reduces the time to manually segment a CT scan from four hours to six minutes and reduces machine learning-assisted segmentation time by 10\% compared to prior work.

Title: A Heterogeneous Multiscale Method for Efficient Simulation of Power Systems with Inverter-Based Resources
Authors: Kaiyang Huang, Min Xiong, Yang Liu, Kai Sun
Abstract: As inverter-based resources (IBRs) penetrate power systems, the dynamics become more complex, exhibiting multiple timescales, including electromagnetic transient (EMT) dynamics of power electronic controllers and electromechanical dynamics of synchronous generators. Consequently, the power system model becomes highly stiff, posing a challenge for efficient simulation using existing methods that focus on dynamics within a single timescale. This paper proposes a Heterogeneous Multiscale Method for highly efficient multi-timescale simulation of a power system represented by its EMT model. The new method alternates between the microscopic EMT model of the system and an automatically reduced macroscopic model, varying the step size accordingly to achieve significant acceleration while maintaining accuracy in both fast and slow dynamics of interests. It also incorporates a semi-analytical solution method to enable a more adaptive variable-step mechanism. The new simulation method is illustrated using a two-area system and is then tested on a detailed EMT model of the IEEE 39-bus system.

Title: PI-Controlled Variable Time-Step Power System Simulation Using an Adaptive Order Differential Transformation Method
Authors: Kaiyang Huang, Yang Liu, Kai Sun, Feng Qiu
Abstract: Dynamic simulation plays a crucial role in power system transient stability analysis, but traditional numerical integration-based methods are time-consuming due to the small time step sizes. Other semi-analytical solution methods, such as the Differential Transformation method, often struggle to select proper orders and steps, leading to slow performance and numerical instability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel adaptive dynamic simulation approach for power system transient stability analysis. The approach adds feedback control and optimization to selecting the step and order, utilizing the Differential Transformation method and a proportional-integral control strategy to control truncation errors. Order selection is formulated as an optimization problem resulting in a variable-step-optimal-order method that achieves significantly larger time step sizes without violating numerical stability. It is applied to three systems: the IEEE 9-bus, 3-generator system, IEEE 39-bus, 10-generator system, and a Polish 2383-bus, 327-generator system, promising computational efficiency and numerical robustness for large-scale power system is demonstrated in comprehensive case studies.

Title: Analysis and Mitigation of Cascading Failures Using a Stochastic Interaction Graph with Eigen-analysis
Authors: Zhenping Guo, Xiaowen Su, Kai Sun, Byungkwon Park, Srdjan Simunovic
Abstract: In studies on complex network systems using graph theory, eigen-analysis is typically performed on an undirected graph model of the network. However, when analyzing cascading failures in a power system, the interactions among failures suggest the need for a directed graph beyond the topology of the power system to model directions of failure propagation. To accurately quantify failure interactions for effective mitigation strategies, this paper proposes a stochastic interaction graph model and associated eigen-analysis. Different types of modes on failure propagations are defined and characterized by the eigenvalues of a stochastic interaction matrix, whose absolute values are unity, zero, or in between. Finding and interpreting these modes helps identify the probable patterns of failure propagation, either local or widespread, and the participating components based on eigenvectors. Then, by lowering the failure probabilities of critical components highly participating in a mode of widespread failures, cascading can be mitigated. The validity of the proposed stochastic interaction graph model, eigen-analysis and the resulting mitigation strategies is demonstrated using simulated cascading failure data on an NPCC 140-bus system.

Title: ValSub: Subsampling Validation Data to Mitigate Forgetting during ASR Personalization
Authors: Haaris Mehmood, Karthikeyan Saravanan, Pablo Peso Parada, David Tuckey, Mete Ozay, Gil Ho Lee, Jungin Lee, Seokyeong Jung
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is widely used within consumer devices such as mobile phones. Recently, personalization or on-device model fine-tuning has shown that adaptation of ASR models towards target user speech improves their performance over rare words or accented speech. Despite these gains, fine-tuning on user data (target domain) risks the personalized model to forget knowledge about its original training distribution (source domain) i.e. catastrophic forgetting, leading to subpar general ASR performance. A simple and efficient approach to combat catastrophic forgetting is to measure forgetting via a validation set that represents the source domain distribution. However, such validation sets are large and impractical for mobile devices. Towards this, we propose a novel method to subsample a substantially large validation set into a smaller one while maintaining the ability to estimate forgetting. We demonstrate the efficacy of such a dataset in mitigating forgetting by utilizing it to dynamically determine the number of ideal fine-tuning epochs. When measuring the deviations in per user fine-tuning epochs against a 50x larger validation set (oracle), our method achieves a lower mean-absolute-error (3.39) compared to randomly selected subsets of the same size (3.78-8.65). Unlike random baselines, our method consistently tracks the oracle's behaviour across three different forgetting thresholds.

Title: RIS-Assisted Joint Sensing and Communications via Fractionally Constrained Fractional Programming
Authors: Yiming Liu, Kareem M. Attiah, Wei Yu
Abstract: This paper studies an uplink dual-functional sensing and communication system aided by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), whose reflection pattern is optimally configured to trade-off sensing and communication functionalities. Specifically, the Bayesian Cramér-Rao lower bound (BCRLB) for estimating the azimuth angle of a sensing user is minimized while ensuring the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio constraints for communication users. We show that this problem can be formulated as a novel fractionally constrained fractional programming (FCFP) problem. To deal with this highly nontrivial problem, we extend a quadratic transform technique, originally proposed to handle optimization problems containing ratio structures only in objectives, to the scenario where the constraints also contain ratio structures. First, we consider the case where the fading coefficient is known. Using the quadratic transform, the FCFP problem is turned into a sequence of subproblems that are convex except for the constant-modulus constraints which can be tackled using a penalty-based method. To further reduce the computational complexity, we leverage the constant-modulus conditions and propose a novel linear transform. This new transform enables the FCFP problem to be turned into a sequence of linear programming (LP) subproblems, which can be solved with linear complexity in the dimension of reflecting elements. Then, we consider the case where the fading coefficient is unknown. A modified BCRLB is used to make the problem more tractable, and the proposed quadratic transform-based algorithm is used to solve the problem. Finally, numerical results unveil nontrivial and effective reflection patterns that the RIS can be configured to generate to facilitate both functionalities.

Title: Human Physical Interaction based on UAV Cooperative Payload Transportation System using Adaptive Backstepping and FNTSMC
Authors: Hussein N. Naser, Hashim A. Hashim, Mojtaba Ahmadi
Abstract: This paper presents a nonlinear control strategy for an aerial cooperative payload transportation system consisting of two quadrotor UAVs rigidly connected to a payload. The system includes human physical interaction facilitated by an admittance control. The proposed control framework integrates an adaptive Backstepping controller for the position subsystem and a Fast Nonsingular Terminal Sliding Mode Control (FNTSMC) for the attitude subsystem to ensure asymptotic stabilization. The admittance controller interprets the interaction forces from the human operator, generating reference trajectories for the position controller to ensure accurate tracking of the operator's guidance. The system aims to assist humans in payload transportation, providing both stability and responsiveness. The robustness and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme in maintaining system stability and performance under various conditions are presented.

Title: Growing Into an Adaptive and Reconfigurable Paradigm for Spectrum Sharing
Authors: Charles Baylis, Douglas Sicker, Austin Egbert, Andrew Clegg, Tom Brooks, Casey Latham, Robert J. Marks II
Abstract: A significant movement from rigid use of the wireless spectrum toward adaptive and reconfigurable spectrum use has been prompted by increasing spectral crowding. Some bands have moved to an adaptive sharing model, and proposals are growing for this approach to be applied to additional bands. The process of moving from a fixed, rigid spectrum paradigm to adaptive and reconfigurable use involves maturation of policy and technology at multiple levels within the system of systems. Using the concept of Bloom's Taxonomy from the education discipline, this paper examines the development of a policy and technology progression toward a mature, adaptive and reconfigurable paradigm.

Title: Edge-Fog Computing-Enabled EEG Data Compression via Asymmetrical Variational Discrete Cosine Transform Network
Authors: Xin Zhu, Hongyi Pan, Ahmet Enis Cetin
Abstract: The large volume of electroencephalograph (EEG) data produced by brain-computer interface (BCI) systems presents challenges for rapid transmission over bandwidth-limited channels in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. To address the issue, we propose a novel multi-channel asymmetrical variational discrete cosine transform (DCT) network for EEG data compression within an edge-fog computing framework. At the edge level, low-complexity DCT compression units are designed using parallel trainable hard-thresholding and scaling operators to remove redundant data and extract the effective latent space representation. At the fog level, an adaptive filter bank is applied to merge important features from adjacent channels into each individual channel by leveraging inter-channel correlations. Then, the inverse DCT reconstructed multi-head attention is developed to capture both local and global dependencies and reconstruct the original signals. Furthermore, by applying the principles of variational inference, a new evidence lower bound is formulated as the loss function, driving the model to balance compression efficiency and reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior compression performance without sacrificing any useful information for BCI detection compared with state-of-the-art techniques, indicating a feasible solution for EEG data compression.

Title: Reference-Free 3D Reconstruction of Brain Dissection Photographs with Machine Learning
Authors: Lin Tian, Sean I. Young, Jonathan Williams Ramirez, Dina Zemlyanker, Lucas Jacob Deden Binder, Rogeny Herisse, Theresa R. Connors, Derek H. Oakley, Bradley T. Hyman, Oula Puonti, Matthew S. Rosen, Juan Eugenio Iglesias
Abstract: Correlation of neuropathology with MRI has the potential to transfer microscopic signatures of pathology to invivo scans. Recently, a classical registration method has been proposed, to build these correlations from 3D reconstructed stacks of dissection photographs, which are routinely taken at brain banks. These photographs bypass the need for exvivo MRI, which is not widely accessible. However, this method requires a full stack of brain slabs and a reference mask (e.g., acquired with a surface scanner), which severely limits the applicability of the technique. Here we propose RefFree, a dissection photograph reconstruction method without external reference. RefFree is a learning approach that estimates the 3D coordinates in the atlas space for every pixel in every photograph; simple least-squares fitting can then be used to compute the 3D reconstruction. As a by-product, RefFree also produces an atlas-based segmentation of the reconstructed stack. RefFree is trained on synthetic photographs generated from digitally sliced 3D MRI data, with randomized appearance for enhanced generalization ability. Experiments on simulated and real data show that RefFree achieves performance comparable to the baseline method without an explicit reference while also enabling reconstruction of partial stacks. Our code is available at this https URL.

Title: Combining Cooperative Re-Routing with Intersection Coordination for Connected and Automated Vehicles in Urban Networks
Authors: Panagiotis Typaldos, Andreas A. Malikopoulos
Abstract: In this paper, we present a hierarchical framework that integrates upper-level routing with low-level optimal trajectory planning for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) traveling in an urban network. The upper-level controller efficiently distributes traffic flows by utilizing a dynamic re-routing algorithm that leverages real-time density information and the fundamental diagrams of each network edge. This re-routing approach predicts when each edge will reach critical density and proactively adjusts the routing algorithm's weights to prevent congestion before it occurs. The low-level controller coordinates CAVs as they cross signal-free intersections, generating optimal, fuel-efficient trajectories while ensuring safe passage by satisfying all relevant constraints. We formulate the problem as an optimal control problem and derive an analytical solution. Using the SUMO micro-simulation platform, we conduct simulation experiments on a realistic network. The results show that our hierarchical framework significantly enhances network performance compared to a baseline static routing approach. By dynamically re-routing vehicles, our approach successfully reduces total travel time and mitigates congestion before it develops.

Title: Target Sensing With Off-grid Sparse Bayesian Learning for AFDM-ISAC System
Authors: Yirui Luo, Yong Liang Guan, Yao Ge, Chau Yuen
Abstract: The recently proposed multi-chirp waveform, affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM), is regarded as a prospective candidate for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) due to its robust performance in high-mobility scenarios and full diversity achievement in doubly dispersive channels. However, the insufficient Doppler resolution caused by limited transmission duration can reduce the accuracy of parameter estimation. In this paper, we propose a new off-grid target parameter estimation scheme to jointly estimate the range and velocity of the targets for AFDM-ISAC system, where the off-grid Doppler components are incorporated to enhance estimation accuracy. Specifically, we form the sensing model as an off-grid sparse signal recovery problem relying on the virtual delay and Doppler grids defined in the discrete affine Fourier (DAF) domain, where the off-grid components are regarded as hyper-parameters for estimation. We also employ the expectation-maximization (EM) technique via a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework to update hyper-parameters iteratively. Simulation results indicate that our proposed off-grid algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in sensing performance and is highly robust to the AFDM-ISAC high-mobility scenario.

Title: RSR-NF: Neural Field Regularization by Static Restoration Priors for Dynamic Imaging
Authors: Berk Iskender, Sushan Nakarmi, Nitin Daphalapurkar, Marc L. Klasky, Yoram Bresler
Abstract: Dynamic imaging involves the reconstruction of a spatio-temporal object at all times using its undersampled measurements. In particular, in dynamic computed tomography (dCT), only a single projection at one view angle is available at a time, making the inverse problem very challenging. Moreover, ground-truth dynamic data is usually either unavailable or too scarce to be used for supervised learning techniques. To tackle this problem, we propose RSR-NF, which uses a neural field (NF) to represent the dynamic object and, using the Regularization-by-Denoising (RED) framework, incorporates an additional static deep spatial prior into a variational formulation via a learned restoration operator. We use an ADMM-based algorithm with variable splitting to efficiently optimize the variational objective. We compare RSR-NF to three alternatives: NF with only temporal regularization; a recent method combining a partially-separable low-rank representation with RED using a denoiser pretrained on static data; and a deep-image prior-based model. The first comparison demonstrates the reconstruction improvements achieved by combining the NF representation with static restoration priors, whereas the other two demonstrate the improvement over state-of-the art techniques for dCT.

Title: A New Interpretation of the Time-Interleaved ADC Mismatch Problem: A Tracking-Based Hybrid Calibration Approach
Authors: Jiwon Sung, Jinseok Choi
Abstract: Time-interleaved ADCs (TI-ADCs) achieve high sampling rates by interleaving multiple sub-ADCs in parallel. Mismatch errors between the sub-ADCs, however, can significantly degrade the signal quality, which is a main performance bottleneck. This paper presents a hybrid calibration approach by interpreting the mismatch problem as a tracking problem, and uses the extended Kalman filter for online estimation and compensation of the mismatch errors. After estimation, the desired signal is reconstructed using a truncated fractional delay filter and a high-pass filter. Simulations demonstrate that our algorithm substantially outperforms the existing hybrid calibration method in both mismatch estimation and compensation.

Title: CPLOYO: A Pulmonary Nodule Detection Model with Multi-Scale Feature Fusion and Nonlinear Feature Learning
Authors: Meng Wang, Zi Yang, Ruifeng Zhao, Yaoting Jiang
Abstract: The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in pulmonary nodule detection significantly enhances the intelligence and real-time capabilities of the detection system. Currently, lung nodule detection primarily focuses on the identification of solid nodules, but different types of lung nodules correspond to various forms of lung cancer. Multi-type detection contributes to improving the overall lung cancer detection rate and enhancing the cure rate. To achieve high sensitivity in nodule detection, targeted improvements were made to the YOLOv8 model. Firstly, the C2f\_RepViTCAMF module was introduced to augment the C2f module in the backbone, thereby enhancing detection accuracy for small lung nodules and achieving a lightweight model design. Secondly, the MSCAF module was incorporated to reconstruct the feature fusion section of the model, improving detection accuracy for lung nodules of varying scales. Furthermore, the KAN network was integrated into the model. By leveraging the KAN network's powerful nonlinear feature learning capability, detection accuracy for small lung nodules was further improved, and the model's generalization ability was enhanced. Tests conducted on the LUNA16 dataset demonstrate that the improved model outperforms the original model as well as other mainstream models such as YOLOv9 and RT-DETR across various evaluation metrics.

Authors: Juha-Matti Runtti, Usman Virk, Pekka Kyosti, Lassi Hentil, Jukka Kyrolainen, Fengchun Zhang
Abstract: 6G radio access architecture is envisioned to contain a network of short-range in-X subnetworks with enhanced capabilities to provide efficient and reliable wireless connectivity. Short-range communications in industrial environments are actively researched at the so-called mid-bands or FR3, e.g., in the EU SNS JU 6G-SHINE project. In this paper, we analyze omni-directional radio channel measurements at 10--12 GHz frequency band to estimate large-scale channel characteristics including power-delay profile, delay spread, K-factor, and pathloss for 254 radio links measured in the Industrial Production Lab at Aalborg University, Denmark. Moreover, we perform a comparison of estimated parameters with those of the 3GPP Indoor Factory channel model.

Title: Dual-domain Modulation Network for Lightweight Image Super-Resolution
Authors: Wenjie Li, Heng Guo, Yuefeng Hou, Guangwei Gao, Zhanyu Ma
Abstract: Lightweight image super-resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution images with limited computational costs. We find existing frequency-based SR methods cannot balance the reconstruction of overall structures and high-frequency parts. Meanwhile, these methods are inefficient for handling frequency features and unsuitable for lightweight SR. In this paper, we show introducing both wavelet and Fourier information allows our model to consider both high-frequency features and overall SR structure reconstruction while reducing costs. Specifically, we propose a dual-domain modulation network that utilize wavelet-domain modulation self-Transformer (WMT) plus Fourier supervision to modulate frequency features in addition to spatial domain modulation. Compared to existing frequency-based SR modules, our WMT is more suitable for frequency learning in lightweight SR. Experimental results show that our method achieves a comparable PSNR of SRFormer and MambaIR while with less than 50% and 60% of their FLOPs and achieving inference speeds 15.4x and 5.4x faster, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method on SR quality and lightweight. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

Title: Sum-Rate Maximization for Pinching Antenna-assisted NOMA Systems with Multiple Dielectric Waveguides
Authors: Shaokang Hu, Ruotong Zhao, Yihuan Liao, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng, Jinhong Yuan
Abstract: This paper investigates the resource allocation design for a pinching antenna (PA)-assisted multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system featuring multiple dielectric waveguides. To enhance model accuracy, we propose a novel frequency-dependent power attenuation model for dielectric waveguides in PA-assisted systems. By jointly optimizing the precoder vector and the PA placement, we aim to maximize the system's sum-rate while accounting for the power attenuation across dielectric waveguides. The design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem. To effectively address the problem at hand, we introduce an alternating optimization-based algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution in polynomial time. Our results demonstrate that the proposed PA-assisted system not only significantly outperforms the conventional system but also surpasses a naive PA-assisted system that disregards power attenuation. The performance gain compared to the naive PA-assisted system becomes more pronounced at high carrier frequencies, emphasizing the importance of considering power attenuation in system design.

Title: One-bit consensus of controllable linear multi-agent systems with communication noises
Authors: Ru An, Ying Wang, Yanlong Zhao, Ji-Feng Zhang
Abstract: This paper addresses the one-bit consensus of controllable linear multi-agent systems (MASs) with communication noises. A consensus algorithm consisting of a communication protocol and a consensus controller is designed. The communication protocol introduces a linear compression encoding function to achieve a one-bit data rate, thereby saving communication costs. The consensus controller with a stabilization term and a consensus term is proposed to ensure the consensus of a potentially unstable but controllable MAS. Specifically, in the consensus term, we adopt an estimation method to overcome the information loss caused by one-bit communications and a decay step to attenuate the effect of communication noise. Two combined Lyapunov functions are constructed to overcome the difficulty arising from the coupling of the control and estimation. By establishing similar iterative structures of these two functions, this paper shows that the MAS can achieve consensus in the mean square sense at the rate of the reciprocal of the iteration number under the case with a connected fixed topology. Moreover, the theoretical results are generalized to the case with jointly connected Markovian switching topologies by establishing a certain equivalence relationship between the Markovian switching topologies and a fixed topology. Two simulation examples are given to validate the algorithm.

Title: G$^{2}$SF-MIAD: Geometry-Guided Score Fusion for Multimodal Industrial Anomaly Detection
Authors: Chengyu Tao, Xuanming Cao, Juan Du
Abstract: Industrial quality inspection plays a critical role in modern manufacturing by identifying defective products during production. While single-modality approaches using either 3D point clouds or 2D RGB images suffer from information incompleteness, multimodal anomaly detection offers promise through the complementary fusion of crossmodal data. However, existing methods face challenges in effectively integrating unimodal results and improving discriminative power. To address these limitations, we first reinterpret memory bank-based anomaly scores in single modalities as isotropic Euclidean distances in local feature spaces. Dynamically evolving from Eulidean metrics, we propose a novel \underline{G}eometry-\underline{G}uided \underline{S}core \underline{F}usion (G$^{2}$SF) framework that progressively learns an anisotropic local distance metric as a unified score for the fusion task. Through a geometric encoding operator, a novel Local Scale Prediction Network (LSPN) is proposed to predict direction-aware scaling factors that characterize first-order local feature distributions, thereby enhancing discrimination between normal and anomalous patterns. Additionally, we develop specialized loss functions and score aggregation strategy from geometric priors to ensure both metric generalization and efficacy. Comprehensive evaluations on the MVTec-3D AD dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art detection performance of our method with low positive rate and better recall, which is essential in industrial application, and detailed ablation analysis validates each component's contribution.

Title: High-Resolution Uplink Sensing in Millimeter-Wave ISAC Systems
Authors: Liangbin Zhao, Zhitong Ni, Yimeng Feng, Jianguo Li, Xiangyuan Bu, J. Andrew Zhang
Abstract: Perceptive mobile networks (PMNs), integrating ubiquitous sensing capabilities into mobile networks, represent an important application of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in 6G. In this paper, we propose a practical framework for uplink sensing of angle-of-arrival (AoA), Doppler, and delay in millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication systems, which addresses challenges posed by clock asynchrony and hybrid arrays, while being compatible with existing communication protocols. We first introduce a beam scanning method and a corresponding AoA estimation algorithm, which utilizes frequency smoothing to effectively estimate AoAs for both static and dynamic paths. We then propose several methods for constructing a ``clean'' reference signal, which is subsequently used to cancel the effect caused by the clock asynchrony. We further develop a signal ratio-based joint AoA-Doppler-delay estimator and propose an AoA-based 2D-FFT-MUSIC (AB2FM) algorithm that applies 2D-FFT operations on the signal subspace, which accelerates the computation process with low complexity. Our proposed framework can estimate parameters in pairs, removing the complicated parameter association process. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework and demonstrate its robustness in both low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.

Title: Neural network-based identification of state-space switching nonlinear systems
Authors: Yanxin Zhang, Chengpu Yu, Filippo Fabiani
Abstract: We design specific neural networks (NNs) for the identification of switching nonlinear systems in the state-space form, which explicitly model the switching behavior and address the inherent coupling between system parameters and switching modes. This coupling is specifically addressed by leveraging the expectation-maximization (EM) framework. In particular, our technique will combine a moving window approach in the E-step to efficiently estimate the switching sequence, together with an extended Kalman filter (EKF) in the M-step to train the NNs with a quadratic convergence rate. Extensive numerical simulations, involving both academic examples and a battery charge management system case study, illustrate that our technique outperforms available ones in terms of parameter estimation accuracy, model fitting, and switching sequence identification.

Title: An LiGME Regularizer of Designated Isolated Minimizers -- An Application to Discrete-Valued Signal Estimation
Authors: Satoshi Shoji, Wataru Yata, Keita Kume, Isao Yamada
Abstract: For a regularized least squares estimation of discrete-valued signals, we propose an LiGME regularizer, as a nonconvex regularizer, of designated isolated minimizers. The proposed regularizer is designed as a Generalized Moreau Enhancement (GME) of the so-called SOAV convex regularizer. Every candidate vector in the discrete-valued set is aimed to be assigned to an isolated local minimizer of the proposed regularizer while the overall convexity of the regularized least squares model is maintained. Moreover, a global minimizer of the proposed model can be approximated iteratively by using a variant of cLiGME algorithm. To enhance the accuracy of the proposed estimation, we also propose a pair of simple modifications, called respectively an iterative reweighting and a generalized superiorization. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithms in a scenario of MIMO signal detection.

Title: Optimal Privacy-Preserving Distributed Median Consensus
Authors: Wenrui Yu, Qiongxiu Li, Richard Heusdens, Sokol Kosta
Abstract: Distributed median consensus has emerged as a critical paradigm in multi-agent systems due to the inherent robustness of the median against outliers and anomalies in measurement. Despite the sensitivity of the data involved, the development of privacy-preserving mechanisms for median consensus remains underexplored. In this work, we present the first rigorous analysis of privacy in distributed median consensus, focusing on an $L_1$-norm minimization framework. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions under which exact consensus and perfect privacy-defined as zero information leakage-can be achieved simultaneously. Our information-theoretic analysis provides provable guarantees against passive and eavesdropping adversaries, ensuring that private data remain concealed. Extensive numerical experiments validate our theoretical results, demonstrating the practical feasibility of achieving both accuracy and privacy in distributed median consensus.

Title: Automatic quality control in multi-centric fetal brain MRI super-resolution reconstruction
Authors: Thomas Sanchez, Vladyslav Zalevsky, Angeline Mihailo, Gerard Martí Juan, Elisenda Eixarch, Andras Jakab, Vincent Dunet, Mériam Koob, Guillaume Auzias, Meritxell Bach Cuadra
Abstract: Quality control (QC) has long been considered essential to guarantee the reliability of neuroimaging studies. It is particularly important for fetal brain MRI, where acquisitions and image processing techniques are less standardized than in adult imaging. In this work, we focus on automated quality control of super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) volumes of fetal brain MRI, an important processing step where multiple stacks of thick 2D slices are registered together and combined to build a single, isotropic and artifact-free T2 weighted volume. We propose FetMRQC$_{SR}$, a machine-learning method that extracts more than 100 image quality metrics to predict image quality scores using a random forest model. This approach is well suited to a problem that is high dimensional, with highly heterogeneous data and small datasets. We validate FetMRQC$_{SR}$ in an out-of-domain (OOD) setting and report high performance (ROC AUC = 0.89), even when faced with data from an unknown site or SRR method. We also investigate failure cases and show that they occur in $45\%$ of the images due to ambiguous configurations for which the rating from the expert is arguable. These results are encouraging and illustrate how a non deep learning-based method like FetMRQC$_{SR}$ is well suited to this multifaceted problem. Our tool, along with all the code used to generate, train and evaluate the model will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

Title: Global synchronization of multi-agent systems with nonlinear interactions
Authors: Anthony Couthures, Vineeth S. Varma, Samson Lasaulce, Irinel-Constantin Morarescu
Abstract: The paper addresses the synchronization of multi-agent systems with continuous-time dynamics interacting through a very general class of monotonic continuous signal functions that covers estimation biases, approximation of discrete quantization, or state-dependent estimation. Our analysis reveals that, in the setup under consideration, synchronization equilibria are exactly the fixed points of the signal function. We also derive intuitive stability conditions based on whether the signal underestimates or overestimates the state of the agents around these fixed points. Moreover, we show that network topology plays a crucial role in asymptotic synchronization. These results provide interesting insights into the interplay between communication nonlinearity and network connectivity, paving the way for advanced coordination strategies in complex systems.

Title: Reach-Avoid-Stay-Collision-Avoidance Negotiation Framework for Multi-Agent Systems via Spatiotemporal Tubes
Authors: Mohd. Faizuddin Faruqui, Ratnangshu Das, Ravi Kumar L, Pushpak Jagtap
Abstract: This study presents a multi-agent negotiation-based framework to obtain collision-free paths while performing prescribed-time reach-avoid-stay (RAS) tasks for agents with unknown dynamics and bounded disturbance. By employing spatiotemporal tubes to generate time-varying state constraints, we ensure that all agents adhere to RAS specifications using synthesized controllers. To prevent inter-agent collisions, a negotiation mechanism is proposed where successful negotiations result in spatiotemporal tubes for each agent fulfilling desired tasks. This approach results in a completely distributed, approximation-free control law for each agent. The effectiveness of this mechanism was validated through simulations of multi-agent robot navigation and drone navigation tasks involving prescribed-time RAS specifications and collision avoidance.

Title: Markerless Tracking-Based Registration for Medical Image Motion Correction
Authors: Luisa Neubig, Deirdre Larsen, Takeshi Ikuma, Markus Kopp, Melda Kunduk, Andreas M. Kist
Abstract: Our study focuses on isolating swallowing dynamics from interfering patient motion in videofluoroscopy, an X-ray technique that records patients swallowing a radiopaque bolus. These recordings capture multiple motion sources, including head movement, anatomical displacements, and bolus transit. To enable precise analysis of swallowing physiology, we aim to eliminate distracting motion, particularly head movement, while preserving essential swallowing-related dynamics. Optical flow methods fail due to artifacts like flickering and instability, making them unreliable for distinguishing different motion groups. We evaluated markerless tracking approaches (CoTracker, PIPs++, TAP-Net) and quantified tracking accuracy in key medical regions of interest. Our findings show that even sparse tracking points generate morphing displacement fields that outperform leading registration methods such as ANTs, LDDMM, and VoxelMorph. To compare all approaches, we assessed performance using MSE and SSIM metrics post-registration. We introduce a novel motion correction pipeline that effectively removes disruptive motion while preserving swallowing dynamics and surpassing competitive registration techniques. Code will be available after review.

Title: Symplectic Wigner Distribution in the Linear Canonical Transform Domain: Theory and Application
Authors: Yangfan He, Zhichao Zhang
Abstract: This paper devotes to combine the chirp basis function transformation and symplectic coordinates transformation to yield a novel Wigner distribution (WD) associated with the linear canonical transform (LCT), named as the symplectic WD in the LCT domain (SWDL). It incorporates the merits of the symplectic WD (SWD) and the WD in the LCT domain (WDL), achieving stronger capability in the linear frequency-modulated (LFM) signal frequency rate feature extraction while maintaining the same level of computational complexity. Some essential properties of the SWDL are derived, including marginal distributions, energy conservations, unique reconstruction, Moyal formula, complex conjugate symmetry, time reversal symmetry, scaling property, time translation property, frequency modulation property, and time translation and frequency modulation property. Heisenberg's uncertainty principles of the SWDL are formulated, giving rise to three kinds of lower bounds attainable respectively by Gaussian enveloped complex exponential signal, Gaussian signal and Gaussian enveloped chirp signal. The optimal symplectic matrices corresponding to the highest time-frequency resolution are generated by solving the lower bound optimization (minimization) problem. The time-frequency resolution of the SWDL is compared with those of the SWD and WDL to demonstrate its superiority in LFM signals time-frequency energy concentration. A synthesis example is also carried out to verify the feasibility and reliability of the theoretical analysis.

Title: Robust Learning-Based Sparse Recovery for Device Activity Detection in Grant-Free Random Access Cell-Free Massive MIMO: Enhancing Resilience to Impairments
Authors: Ali Elkeshawy, Haifa Fares, Amor Nafkha
Abstract: Massive MIMO is considered a key enabler to support massive machine-type communication (mMTC). While massive access schemes have been extensively analyzed for co-located massive MIMO arrays, this paper explores activity detection in grant-free random access for mMTC within the context of cell-free massive MIMO systems, employing distributed antenna arrays. This sparse support recovery of device activity status is performed by a finite cluster of access points (APs) from a large number of geographically distributed APs collaborating to serve a larger number of devices. Active devices transmit non-orthogonal pilot sequences to APs, which forward the received signals to a central processing unit (CPU) for collaborative activity detection. This paper proposes a simple and efficient data-driven algorithm tailored for device activity detection, implemented centrally at the CPU. Furthermore, the study assesses the algorithm's robustness to input perturbations and examines the effects of adopting fixed-point representation on its performance.

Title: CoDiPhy: A General Framework for Applying Denoising Diffusion Models to the Physical Layer of Wireless Communication Systems
Authors: Peyman Neshaastegaran, Ming Jian
Abstract: Generative models, including denoising diffusion models (DM), are gaining attention in wireless applications due to their ability to learn complex data distributions. In this paper, we propose CoDiPhy, a novel framework that leverages conditional denoising diffusion models to address a wide range of wireless physical layer problems. A key challenge of using DM is the need to assume or approximate Gaussian signal models. CoDiPhy addresses this by incorporating a conditional encoder as a guidance mechanism, mapping problem observations to a latent space and removing the Gaussian constraint. By combining conditional encoding, time embedding layers, and a U-Net-based main neural network, CoDiPhy introduces a noise prediction neural network, replacing the conventional approach used in DM. This adaptation enables CoDiPhy to serve as an effective solution for a wide range of detection, estimation, and predistortion tasks. We demonstrate CoDiPhy's adaptability through two case studies: an OFDM receiver for detection and phase noise compensation for estimation. In both cases, CoDiPhy outperforms conventional methods by a significant margin.

Title: Bilingual Dual-Head Deep Model for Parkinson's Disease Detection from Speech
Authors: Moreno La Quatra, Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave, Marco Sabato Siniscalchi
Abstract: This work aims to tackle the Parkinson's disease (PD) detection problem from the speech signal in a bilingual setting by proposing an ad-hoc dual-head deep neural architecture for type-based binary classification. One head is specialized for diadochokinetic patterns. The other head looks for natural speech patterns present in continuous spoken utterances. Only one of the two heads is operative accordingly to the nature of the input. Speech representations are extracted from self-supervised learning (SSL) models and wavelet transforms. Adaptive layers, convolutional bottlenecks, and contrastive learning are exploited to reduce variations across languages. Our solution is assessed against two distinct datasets, EWA-DB, and PC-GITA, which cover Slovak and Spanish languages, respectively. Results indicate that conventional models trained on a single language dataset struggle with cross-linguistic generalization, and naive combinations of datasets are suboptimal. In contrast, our model improves generalization on both languages, simultaneously.

Title: PS3C: An Ensemble-Based Two-Step Framework for Classification of Pep Smear Cell Images
Authors: Theo Di Piazza, Loic Boussel
Abstract: Early detection of cervical cancer is crucial for improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality by identifying precancerous lesions as soon as possible. As a result, the use of pap smear screening has significantly increased, leading to a growing demand for automated tools that can assist cytologists managing their rising workload. To address this, the Pep Smear Cell Classification Challenge (PS3C) has been organized in association with ISBI in 2025. This project aims to promote the development of automated tools for pep smear images classification. The analyzed images are grouped into four categories: healthy, unhealthy, both, and rubbish images which are considered as unsuitable for diagnosis. In this work, we propose a two-stage ensemble approach: first, a neural network determines whether an image is rubbish or not. If not, a second neural network classifies the image as containing a healthy cell, an unhealthy cell, or both.

Title: Liquid Lens-Based Imaging Receiver for MIMO VLC Systems
Authors: Kapila W. S. Palitharathna, Christodoulos Skouroumounis, Ioannis Krikidis
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a tunable liquid convex lens-assisted imaging receiver for indoor multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) visible light communication (VLC) systems. In contrast to existing MIMO VLC receivers that rely on fixed optical lenses, the proposed receiver leverages the additional degrees of freedom offered by liquid lenses via adjusting both focal length and orientation angles of the lens. This capability facilitates the mitigation of spatial correlation between the channel gains, thereby enhancing the overall signal quality and leading to improved bit-error rate (BER) performance. We present an accurate channel model for the liquid lens-assisted VLC system by using three-dimensional geometry and geometric optics. To achieve optimal performance under practical conditions such as random receiver orientation and user mobility, optimization of both focal length and orientation angles of the lens are required. To this end, driven by the fact that channel models are mathematically complex, we present two optimization schemes including a blockwise machine learning (ML) architecture that includes convolution layers to extract spatial features from the received signal, long-short term memory layers to predict the user position and orientation, and fully connected layers to estimate the optimal lens parameters. Numerical results are presented to compare the performance of each scheme with conventional receivers. Results show that a significant BER improvement is achieved when liquid lenses and presented ML-based optimization approaches are used. Specifically, the BER can be improved from $6\times 10^{-2}$ to $1.4\times 10^{-3}$ at an average signal-to-noise ratio of $30$ dB.

Title: Some remarks on robustness of sample-and-hold stabilization
Authors: Patrick Schmidt, Pavel Osinenko, Stefan Streif
Abstract: This work studies robustness to system disturbance and measurement noise of some popular general practical stabilization techniques, namely, Dini aiming, optimization-based stabilization and inf-convolution stabilization. Common to all these techniques is the explicit usage of a (general nonsmooth) control Lyapunov function, thus allowing to see them as a kind of generalization to the celebrated Sontag's formula. It turns out that certain details of the above described robustness properties have not yet received the attention in literature they deserved. We provide new remarks, formalized in mathematical propositions, on robustness of selected popular stabilization techniques along with an extensive statistical case study on a robot parking problem.

Title: Standard Heisenberg's uncertainty principles of Cohen's class time-frequency distribution with specific kernels
Authors: Zhichao Zhang
Abstract: Time-frequency concentration and resolution of the Cohen's class time-frequency distribution (CCTFD) has attracted much attention in time-frequency analysis. A variety of uncertainty principles of the CCTFD is therefore derived, including the weak Heisenberg type, the Hardy type, the Nazarov type, and the local type. However, the standard Heisenberg type still remains unresolved. In this study, we address the question of how the standard Heisenberg's uncertainty principle of the CCTFD is affected by fundamental properties. The investigated distribution properties are Parseval's relation and the concise frequency domain definition (i.e., only frequency variables are explicitly found in the tensor product), based on which we confine our attention to the CCTFD with some specific kernels. That is the unit modulus and v-independent time translation, reversal and scaling invariant kernel CCTFD (UMITRSK-CCTFD). We then extend the standard Heisenberg's uncertainty principles of the Wigner distribution to those of the UMITRSK-CCTFD, giving birth to various types of attainable lower bounds on the uncertainty product in the UMITRSK-CCTFD domain. The derived results strengthen the existing weak Heisenberg type and fill gaps in the standard Heisenberg type.

Title: A nonlinear real time capable motion cueing algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning
Authors: Hendrik Scheidel, Camilo Gonzalez, Houshyar Asadi, Tobias Bellmann, Andreas Seefried, Shady Mohamed, Saeid Nahavandi
Abstract: In motion simulation, motion cueing algorithms are used for the trajectory planning of the motion simulator platform, where workspace limitations prevent direct reproduction of reference trajectories. Strategies such as motion washout, which return the platform to its center, are crucial in these settings. For serial robotic MSPs with highly nonlinear workspaces, it is essential to maximize the efficient utilization of the MSPs kinematic and dynamic capabilities. Traditional approaches, including classical washout filtering and linear model predictive control, fail to consider platform-specific, nonlinear properties, while nonlinear model predictive control, though comprehensive, imposes high computational demands that hinder real-time, pilot-in-the-loop application without further simplification. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning for motion cueing, demonstrated here for the first time in a 6-degree-of-freedom setting with full consideration of the MSPs kinematic nonlinearities. Previous work by the authors successfully demonstrated the application of DRL to a simplified 2-DOF setup, which did not consider kinematic or dynamic constraints. This approach has been extended to all 6 DOF by incorporating a complete kinematic model of the MSP into the algorithm, a crucial step for enabling its application on a real motion simulator. The training of the DRL-MCA is based on Proximal Policy Optimization in an actor-critic implementation combined with an automated hyperparameter optimization. After detailing the necessary training framework and the algorithm itself, we provide a comprehensive validation, demonstrating that the DRL MCA achieves competitive performance against established algorithms. Moreover, it generates feasible trajectories by respecting all system constraints and meets all real-time requirements with low...

Title: Low Complexity Point Tracking of the Myocardium in 2D Echocardiography
Authors: Artem Chernyshov, John Nyberg, Vegard Holmstrøm, Md Abulkalam Azad, Bjørnar Grenne, Håvard Dalen, Svein Arne Aase, Lasse Lovstakken, Andreas Østvik
Abstract: Deep learning methods for point tracking are applicable in 2D echocardiography, but do not yet take advantage of domain specifics that enable extremely fast and efficient configurations. We developed MyoTracker, a low-complexity architecture (0.3M parameters) for point tracking in echocardiography. It builds on the CoTracker2 architecture by simplifying its components and extending the temporal context to provide point predictions for the entire sequence in a single step. We applied MyoTracker to the right ventricular (RV) myocardium in RV-focused recordings and compared the results with those of CoTracker2 and EchoTracker, another specialized point tracking architecture for echocardiography. MyoTracker achieved the lowest average point trajectory error at 2.00 $\pm$ 0.53 mm. Calculating RV Free Wall Strain (RV FWS) using MyoTracker's point predictions resulted in a -0.3$\%$ bias with 95$\%$ limits of agreement from -6.1$\%$ to 5.4$\%$ compared to reference values from commercial software. This range falls within the interobserver variability reported in previous studies. The limits of agreement were wider for both CoTracker2 and EchoTracker, worse than the interobserver variability. At inference, MyoTracker used 67$\%$ less GPU memory than CoTracker2 and 84$\%$ less than EchoTracker on large sequences (100 frames). MyoTracker was 74 times faster during inference than CoTracker2 and 11 times faster than EchoTracker with our setup. Maintaining the entire sequence in the temporal context was the greatest contributor to MyoTracker's accuracy. Slight additional gains can be made by re-enabling iterative refinement, at the cost of longer processing time.

Title: Handling Domain Shifts for Anomalous Sound Detection: A Review of DCASE-Related Work
Authors: Kevin Wilkinghoff, Takuya Fujimura, Keisuke Imoto, Jonathan Le Roux, Zheng-Hua Tan, Tomoki Toda
Abstract: When detecting anomalous sounds in complex environments, one of the main difficulties is that trained models must be sensitive to subtle differences in monitored target signals, while many practical applications also require them to be insensitive to changes in acoustic domains. Examples of such domain shifts include changing the type of microphone or the location of acoustic sensors, which can have a much stronger impact on the acoustic signal than subtle anomalies themselves. Moreover, users typically aim to train a model only on source domain data, which they may have a relatively large collection of, and they hope that such a trained model will be able to generalize well to an unseen target domain by providing only a minimal number of samples to characterize the acoustic signals in that domain. In this work, we review and discuss recent publications focusing on this domain generalization problem for anomalous sound detection in the context of the DCASE challenges on acoustic machine condition monitoring.

Title: Optimal Estimation for Continuous-Time Nonlinear Systems Using State-Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE)
Authors: Adnan Tahirovic, Azra Redzovic
Abstract: This paper introduces a unified approach for state estimation and control of nonlinear dynamic systems, employing the State-Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) framework. The proposed approach naturally extends classical linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) methods into nonlinear scenarios, avoiding linearization by using state-dependent coefficient (SDC) matrices. An SDRE-based Kalman filter (SDRE-KF) is integrated within an SDRE-based control structure, providing a coherent and intuitive strategy for nonlinear system analysis and control design. To evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methodology, comparative simulations are conducted on two benchmark nonlinear systems: a simple pendulum and a Van der Pol oscillator. Results demonstrate that the SDRE-KF achieves comparable or superior estimation accuracy compared to traditional methods, including the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Particle Filter (PF). These findings underline the potential of the unified SDRE-based approach as a viable alternative for nonlinear state estimation and control, providing valuable insights for both educational purposes and practical engineering applications.

Title: Phasor-Pursuit Directional Modulation
Authors: David Couto, Arash Samani, Alec Yonika
Abstract: Emitting phased array RF systems have to contend with an ever-increasing number of eavesdroppers as technological advancements provide lower cost and/or more capable radios. Often, eavesdroppers can accumulate sufficient information transmitted in sidelobes by integrating over long enough periods. Directional modulation (DM) disrupts this capability by inducing a randomized walk through IQ-space to reach a pertinent location which corresponds to a symbol of particular amplitude and phase. This results in higher secrecy capacity. The path taken by the cumulative element contributions are determined by the complex weights of individual transmitters. Because large phased arrays support a large number of available paths, repetitions of applied weights are not concerning. The same cannot be said for arrays that consist of only a few elements, e.g. WiFi routers. We introduce a computationally efficient and flexible framework for DM that utilizes real-valued phase rotations of element weights. It supports a wide family of modulation schemes in phase and/or amplitude. Using state-of-the-practice orthogonal noise injection framework, we demonstrate a richness of unique paths resolving concerns about repeated weights. In our proposed scheme, there is a small reduction in received power compared to traditional beamforming, as little as 1 dB, which is an advantage over conventional directional modulation which typically sacrifices 6 dB of power. Also, there is a significantly larger set of possible element weights than that of the conventional scheme. This feature protects against the possibility of eavesdroppers breaking the distortion-based obfuscation of symbols over repeated observations. Our approach provides more secrecy capacity than conventional directional modulation via increased power delivery and increased receiver SNR and does so with resilience to advanced eavesdropping threats.

Title: Rotatable Antennas for Integrated Sensing and Communications
Authors: Chao Zhou, Changsheng You, Beixiong Zheng, Xiaodan Shao, Rui Zhang
Abstract: In this letter, we propose to deploy rotatable antennas (RAs) at the base station (BS) to enhance both communication and sensing (C&S) performances, by exploiting a new spatial degree-of-freedom (DoF) offered by array rotation. Specifically, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to simultaneously maximize the sum-rate of multiple communication users and minimize the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for target angle estimation, by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming vectors and the array rotation angle at the BS. To solve this problem, we first equivalently decompose it into two subproblems, corresponding to an inner problem for beamforming optimization and an outer problem for array rotation optimization. Although these two subproblems are non-convex, we obtain their high-quality solutions by applying the block coordinate descent (BCD) technique and one-dimensional exhaustive search, respectively. Moreover, we show that for the communication-only case, RAs provide an additional rotation gain to improve communication performance; while for the sensing-only case, the equivalent spatial aperture can be enlarged by RAs for achieving higher sensing accuracy. Finally, numerical results are presented to showcase the performance gains of RAs over fixed-rotation antennas in integrated sensing and communications (ISAC).

Title: Safety Filter for Limiting the Current of Grid-Forming Matrix Modular Multilevel Converters
Authors: Michael Schneeberger, Silvia Mastellone, Florian Dörfler
Abstract: Grid-forming (GFM) converters face significant challenges in limiting current during transient grid events while preserving their grid-forming behavior. This paper offers an elegant solution to the problem with a priori guarantees, presenting a safety filter approach based on Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to enforce current constraints with minimal deviation from the nominal voltage reference. The safety filter is implemented as a Quadratic Program, enabling real-time computation of safe voltage adjustments that ensure smooth transitions and maintain the GFM behavior during nominal operation. To provide formal safety certificate, the CBF is synthesized offline using a Sum-of-Squares optimization framework, ensuring that the converter remains within its allowable operating limits under all conditions. Additionally, a Control Lyapunov Function is incorporated to facilitate a smooth return to the nominal operating region following grid events. The proposed method is modular and can be integrated into many of the GFM control architectures, as demonstrated with two different GFM implementations. High-fidelity simulations conducted with an enhanced matrix modular multilevel converter connected to both high-inertia and low-inertia grid scenarios validate the effectiveness of the safety filter, showing that it successfully limits current during faults, preserves GFM behavior, and ensures a seamless recovery to nominal operation.

Title: How Should We Evaluate Uncertainty in Accelerated MRI Reconstruction?
Authors: Luca Trautmann, Peter Wijeratne, Itamar Ronen, Ivor Simpson
Abstract: Reconstructing accelerated MRI is an ill-posed problem. Machine learning has recently shown great promise at this task, but current approaches to quantifying uncertainty focus on measuring the variability in pixelwise intensity variation. Although these provide interpretable maps, they lack structural understanding and they do not have a clear relationship to how the data will be analysed subsequently. In this paper, we propose a new approach to evaluating reconstruction variability based on apparent anatomical changes in the reconstruction, which is more tightly related to common downstream tasks. We use image registration and segmentation to evaluate several common MRI reconstruction approaches, where uncertainty is measured via ensembling, for accelerated imaging. We demonstrate the intrinsic variability in reconstructed images and show that models with high scores on often used quality metrics such as SSIM and PSNR, can nonetheless display high levels of variance and bias in anatomical measures.

Title: Low-Rank Matrix Regression via Least-Angle Regression
Authors: Mingzhou Yin, Matthias A. Müller
Abstract: Low-rank matrix regression is a fundamental problem in data science with various applications in systems and control. Nuclear norm regularization has been widely applied to solve this problem due to its convexity. However, it suffers from high computational complexity and the inability to directly specify the rank. This work introduces a novel framework for low-rank matrix regression that addresses both unstructured and Hankel matrices. By decomposing the low-rank matrix into rank-1 bases, the problem is reformulated as an infinite-dimensional sparse learning problem. The least-angle regression (LAR) algorithm is then employed to solve this problem efficiently. For unstructured matrices, a closed-form LAR solution is derived with equivalence to a normalized nuclear norm regularization problem. For Hankel matrices, a real-valued polynomial basis reformulation enables effective LAR implementation. Two numerical examples in network modeling and system realization demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the nuclear norm method in terms of estimation accuracy and computational efficiency.

Title: Analysis of a continuous opinion and discrete action dynamics model coupled with an external observation dynamics
Authors: Anthony Couthures, Thomas Mongaillard, Vineeth S. Varma, Samson Lasaulce, Irinel-Constantin Morarescu
Abstract: We consider a set of consumers in a city or town (who thus generate pollution) whose opinion is governed by a continuous opinion and discrete action (CODA) dynamics model. This dynamics is coupled with an observation signal dynamics, which defines the information the consumers have access to regarding the common pollution. We show that the external observation signal has a significant impact on the asymptotic behavior of the CODA model. When the coupling is strong, it induces either a chaotic behavior or convergence towards a limit cycle. When the coupling is weak, a more classical behavior characterized by local agreements in polarized clusters is observed. In both cases, conditions under which clusters of consumers don't change their actions are this http URL examples are provided to illustrate the derived analytical results.

Title: V2M4: 4D Mesh Animation Reconstruction from a Single Monocular Video
Authors: Jianqi Chen, Biao Zhang, Xiangjun Tang, Peter Wonka
Abstract: We present V2M4, a novel 4D reconstruction method that directly generates a usable 4D mesh animation asset from a single monocular video. Unlike existing approaches that rely on priors from multi-view image and video generation models, our method is based on native 3D mesh generation models. Naively applying 3D mesh generation models to generate a mesh for each frame in a 4D task can lead to issues such as incorrect mesh poses, misalignment of mesh appearance, and inconsistencies in mesh geometry and texture maps. To address these problems, we propose a structured workflow that includes camera search and mesh reposing, condition embedding optimization for mesh appearance refinement, pairwise mesh registration for topology consistency, and global texture map optimization for texture consistency. Our method outputs high-quality 4D animated assets that are compatible with mainstream graphics and game software. Experimental results across a variety of animation types and motion amplitudes demonstrate the generalization and effectiveness of our method. Project page:this https URL.

Title: Blockchain-Enabled Management Framework for Federated Coalition Networks
Authors: Jorge Álvaro González, Ana María Saiz García, Victor Monzon Baeza
Abstract: In a globalized and interconnected world, interoperability has become a key concept for advancing tactical scenarios. Federated Coalition Networks (FCN) enable cooperation between entities from multiple nations while allowing each to maintain control over their systems. However, this interoperability necessitates the sharing of increasing amounts of information between different tactical assets, raising the need for higher security measures. Emerging technologies like blockchain drive a revolution in secure communications, paving the way for new tactical scenarios. In this work, we propose a blockchain-based framework to enhance the resilience and security of the management of these networks. We offer a guide to FCN design to help a broad audience understand the military networks in international missions by a use case and key functions applied to a proposed architecture. We evaluate its effectiveness and performance in information encryption to validate this framework.

Title: The Pitfalls of Imitation Learning when Actions are Continuous
Authors: Max Simchowitz, Daniel Pfrommer, Ali Jadbabaie
Abstract: We study the problem of imitating an expert demonstrator in a discrete-time, continuous state-and-action control system. We show that, even if the dynamics are stable (i.e. contracting exponentially quickly), and the expert is smooth and deterministic, any smooth, deterministic imitator policy necessarily suffers error on execution that is exponentially larger, as a function of problem horizon, than the error under the distribution of expert training data. Our negative result applies to both behavior cloning and offline-RL algorithms, unless they produce highly "improper" imitator policies--those which are non-smooth, non-Markovian, or which exhibit highly state-dependent stochasticity--or unless the expert trajectory distribution is sufficiently "spread." We provide experimental evidence of the benefits of these more complex policy parameterizations, explicating the benefits of today's popular policy parameterizations in robot learning (e.g. action-chunking and Diffusion Policies). We also establish a host of complementary negative and positive results for imitation in control systems.

Title: Real-Time Risky Fault-Chain Search using Time-Varying Graph RNNs
Authors: Anmol Dwivedi, Ali Tajer
Abstract: This paper introduces a data-driven graphical framework for the real-time search of risky cascading fault chains (FCs) in power-grids, crucial for enhancing grid resiliency in the face of climate change. As extreme weather events driven by climate change increase, identifying risky FCs becomes crucial for mitigating cascading failures and ensuring grid stability. However, the complexity of the spatio-temporal dependencies among grid components and the exponential growth of the search space with system size pose significant challenges to modeling and risky FC search. To tackle this, we model the search process as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which is subsequently solved via a time-varying graph recurrent neural network (GRNN). This approach captures the spatial and temporal structure induced by the system's topology and dynamics, while efficiently summarizing the system's history in the GRNN's latent space, enabling scalable and effective identification of risky FCs.

Title: Aerocapture Guidance for Augmented Bank Angle Modulation
Authors: Kyle Sonandres, Thomas Palazzo, Jonathan P. How
Abstract: This paper presents an optimal control solution for an aerocapture vehicle with two control inputs, bank angle and angle of attack, referred to as augmented bank angle modulation (ABAM). We derive the optimal control profiles using Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, validate the result numerically using the Gauss pseudospectral method (implemented in GPOPS), and introduce a novel guidance algorithm, ABAMGuid, for in-flight decision making. High-fidelity Monte Carlo simulations of a Uranus aerocapture mission demonstrate that ABAMGuid can greatly improve capture success rates and reduce the propellant needed for orbital correction following the atmospheric pass.

Title: Resolution Invariant Autoencoder
Authors: Ashay Patel, Michela Antonelli, Sebastien Ourselin, M. Jorge Cardoso
Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced medical imaging analysis, yet variations in image resolution remain an overlooked challenge. Most methods address this by resampling images, leading to either information loss or computational inefficiencies. While solutions exist for specific tasks, no unified approach has been proposed. We introduce a resolution-invariant autoencoder that adapts spatial resizing at each layer in the network via a learned variable resizing process, replacing fixed spatial down/upsampling at the traditional factor of 2. This ensures a consistent latent space resolution, regardless of input or output resolution. Our model enables various downstream tasks to be performed on an image latent whilst maintaining performance across different resolutions, overcoming the shortfalls of traditional methods. We demonstrate its effectiveness in uncertainty-aware super-resolution, classification, and generative modelling tasks and show how our method outperforms conventional baselines with minimal performance loss across resolutions.

Title: SE(3)-Equivariant Robot Learning and Control: A Tutorial Survey
Authors: Joohwan Seo, Soochul Yoo, Junwoo Chang, Hyunseok An, Hyunwoo Ryu, Soomi Lee, Arvind Kruthiventy, Jongeun CHoi, Roberto Horowitz
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning and Transformers have driven major breakthroughs in robotics by employing techniques such as imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and LLM-based multimodal perception and decision-making. However, conventional deep learning and Transformer models often struggle to process data with inherent symmetries and invariances, typically relying on large datasets or extensive data augmentation. Equivariant neural networks overcome these limitations by explicitly integrating symmetry and invariance into their architectures, leading to improved efficiency and generalization. This tutorial survey reviews a wide range of equivariant deep learning and control methods for robotics, from classic to state-of-the-art, with a focus on SE(3)-equivariant models that leverage the natural 3D rotational and translational symmetries in visual robotic manipulation and control design. Using unified mathematical notation, we begin by reviewing key concepts from group theory, along with matrix Lie groups and Lie algebras. We then introduce foundational group-equivariant neural network design and show how the group-equivariance can be obtained through their structure. Next, we discuss the applications of SE(3)-equivariant neural networks in robotics in terms of imitation learning and reinforcement learning. The SE(3)-equivariant control design is also reviewed from the perspective of geometric control. Finally, we highlight the challenges and future directions of equivariant methods in developing more robust, sample-efficient, and multi-modal real-world robotic systems.

Title: Passivity-Based Local Design Conditions for Global Optimality in Distributed Convex Optimization
Authors: Pol Jane-Soneira, Charles Muller, Felix Strehle, Sören Hohmann
Abstract: In recent times, various distributed optimization algorithms have been proposed for whose specific agent dynamics global optimality and convergence is proven. However, there exist no general conditions for the design of such algorithms. In this paper, we leverage passivity theory to fi rst establish a distributed optimization framework with local design requirements for the agent dynamics in both unconstrained and constrained problems with undirected communication topologies. Under the roof of these requirements, the agents may use heterogeneous optimization algorithms without compromising global optimality and convergence. Subsequently, we propose some exemplary agent systems that comply with the established requirements. Compared to existing approaches, our algorithms do not require any global initialization nor communication of multiple variables. Consequently, the agents may leave or rejoin the networked optimization without compromising convergence to the correct global optimizer. Furthermore, we show that for unconstrained optimization, an extension to directed communication topologies is possible. Simulation results illustrate the plug-and-play capabilities and interoperability of the proposed agent dynamics.

Title: Quantization for OpenAI's Whisper Models: A Comparative Analysis
Authors: Allison Andreyev
Abstract: Automated speech recognition (ASR) models have gained prominence for applications such as captioning, speech translation, and live transcription. This paper studies Whisper and two model variants: one optimized for live speech streaming and another for offline transcription. Notably, these models have been found to generate hallucinated content, reducing transcription reliability. Furthermore, larger model variants exhibit increased latency and pose challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. This study analyzes the similarities and differences between three Whisper models, qualitatively examining their distinct capabilities. Next, this study quantifies the impact of model quantization on latency and evaluates its viability for edge deployment. Using the open source LibriSpeech dataset, this paper evaluates the word error rate (WER) along with latency analysis of whispercpp using 3 quantization methods (INT4, INT5, INT8). Results show that quantization reduces latency by 19\% and model size by 45\%, while preserving transcription accuracy. These findings provide insights into the optimal use cases of different Whisper models and edge device deployment possibilities.

Title: MetricGrids: Arbitrary Nonlinear Approximation with Elementary Metric Grids based Implicit Neural Representation
Authors: Shu Wang, Yanbo Gao, Shuai Li, Chong Lv, Xun Cai, Chuankun Li, Hui Yuan, Jinglin Zhang
Abstract: This paper presents MetricGrids, a novel grid-based neural representation that combines elementary metric grids in various metric spaces to approximate complex nonlinear signals. While grid-based representations are widely adopted for their efficiency and scalability, the existing feature grids with linear indexing for continuous-space points can only provide degenerate linear latent space representations, and such representations cannot be adequately compensated to represent complex nonlinear signals by the following compact decoder. To address this problem while keeping the simplicity of a regular grid structure, our approach builds upon the standard grid-based paradigm by constructing multiple elementary metric grids as high-order terms to approximate complex nonlinearities, following the Taylor expansion principle. Furthermore, we enhance model compactness with hash encoding based on different sparsities of the grids to prevent detrimental hash collisions, and a high-order extrapolation decoder to reduce explicit grid storage requirements. experimental results on both 2D and 3D reconstructions demonstrate the superior fitting and rendering accuracy of the proposed method across diverse signal types, validating its robustness and generalizability.

Title: Fourier Decomposition for Explicit Representation of 3D Point Cloud Attributes
Authors: Donghyun Kim, Hyunah Ko, Chanyoung Kim, Seong Jae Hwang
Abstract: While 3D point clouds are widely utilized across various vision applications, their irregular and sparse nature make them challenging to handle. In response, numerous encoding approaches have been proposed to capture the rich semantic information of point clouds. Yet, a critical limitation persists: a lack of consideration for colored point clouds which are more capable 3D representations as they contain diverse attributes: color and geometry. While existing methods handle these attributes separately on a per-point basis, this leads to a limited receptive field and restricted ability to capture relationships across multiple points. To address this, we pioneer a point cloud encoding methodology that leverages 3D Fourier decomposition to disentangle color and geometric features while extending the receptive field through spectral-domain operations. Our analysis confirms that this encoding approach effectively separates feature components, where the amplitude uniquely captures color attributes and the phase encodes geometric structure, thereby enabling independent learning and utilization of both attributes. Furthermore, the spectral-domain properties of these components naturally aggregate local features while considering multiple points' information. We validate our point cloud encoding approach on point cloud classification and style transfer tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on the DensePoint dataset with improvements via a proposed amplitude-based data augmentation strategy.

Title: Image Quality Assessment: From Human to Machine Preference
Authors: Chunyi Li, Yuan Tian, Xiaoyue Ling, Zicheng Zhang, Haodong Duan, Haoning Wu, Ziheng Jia, Xiaohong Liu, Xiongkuo Min, Guo Lu, Weisi Lin, Guangtao Zhai
Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) based on human subjective preferences has undergone extensive research in the past decades. However, with the development of communication protocols, the visual data consumption volume of machines has gradually surpassed that of humans. For machines, the preference depends on downstream tasks such as segmentation and detection, rather than visual appeal. Considering the huge gap between human and machine visual systems, this paper proposes the topic: Image Quality Assessment for Machine Vision for the first time. Specifically, we (1) defined the subjective preferences of machines, including downstream tasks, test models, and evaluation metrics; (2) established the Machine Preference Database (MPD), which contains 2.25M fine-grained annotations and 30k reference/distorted image pair instances; (3) verified the performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on MPD. Experiments show that current IQA metrics are human-centric and cannot accurately characterize machine preferences. We sincerely hope that MPD can promote the evolution of IQA from human to machine preferences. Project page is on: this https URL.

Title: Efficient Adapter Tuning for Joint Singing Voice Beat and Downbeat Tracking with Self-supervised Learning Features
Authors: Jiajun Deng, Yaolong Ju, Jing Yang, Simon Lui, Xunying Liu
Abstract: Singing voice beat tracking is a challenging task, due to the lack of musical accompaniment that often contains robust rhythmic and harmonic patterns, something most existing beat tracking systems utilize and can be essential for estimating beats. In this paper, a novel temporal convolutional network-based beat-tracking approach featuring self-supervised learning (SSL) representations and adapter tuning is proposed to track the beat and downbeat of singing voices jointly. The SSL DistilHuBERT representations are utilized to capture the semantic information of singing voices and are further fused with the generic spectral features to facilitate beat estimation. Sources of variabilities that are particularly prominent with the non-homogeneous singing voice data are reduced by the efficient adapter tuning. Extensive experiments show that feature fusion and adapter tuning improve the performance individually, and the combination of both leads to significantly better performances than the un-adapted baseline system, with up to 31.6% and 42.4% absolute F1-score improvements on beat and downbeat tracking, respectively.

Title: Hybrid Agents for Image Restoration
Authors: Bingchen Li, Xin Li, Yiting Lu, Zhibo Chen
Abstract: Existing Image Restoration (IR) studies typically focus on task-specific or universal modes individually, relying on the mode selection of users and lacking the cooperation between multiple task-specific/universal restoration modes. This leads to insufficient interaction for unprofessional users and limits their restoration capability for complicated real-world applications. In this work, we present HybridAgent, intending to incorporate multiple restoration modes into a unified image restoration model and achieve intelligent and efficient user interaction through our proposed hybrid agents. Concretely, we propose the hybrid rule of fast, slow, and feedback restoration agents. Here, the slow restoration agent optimizes the powerful multimodal large language model (MLLM) with our proposed instruction-tuning dataset to identify degradations within images with ambiguous user prompts and invokes proper restoration tools accordingly. The fast restoration agent is designed based on a lightweight large language model (LLM) via in-context learning to understand the user prompts with simple and clear requirements, which can obviate the unnecessary time/resource costs of MLLM. Moreover, we introduce the mixed distortion removal mode for our HybridAgents, which is crucial but not concerned in previous agent-based works. It can effectively prevent the error propagation of step-by-step image restoration and largely improve the efficiency of the agent system. We validate the effectiveness of HybridAgent with both synthetic and real-world IR tasks.

Title: Adaptive Inner Speech-Text Alignment for LLM-based Speech Translation
Authors: Henglyu Liu, Andong Chen, Kehai Chen, Xuefeng Bai, Meizhi Zhong, Yuan Qiu, Min Zhang
Abstract: Recent advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to significant breakthroughs across various tasks, laying the foundation for the development of LLM-based speech translation systems. Existing methods primarily focus on aligning inputs and outputs across modalities while overlooking deeper semantic alignment within model representations. To address this limitation, we propose an Adaptive Inner Speech-Text Alignment (AI-STA) method to bridge the modality gap by explicitly aligning speech and text representations at selected layers within LLMs. To achieve this, we leverage the optimal transport (OT) theory to quantify fine-grained representation discrepancies between speech and text. Furthermore, we utilize the cross-modal retrieval technique to identify the layers that are best suited for alignment and perform joint training on these layers. Experimental results on speech translation (ST) tasks demonstrate that AI-STA significantly improves the translation performance of large speech-text models (LSMs), outperforming previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our findings highlight the importance of inner-layer speech-text alignment in LLMs and provide new insights into enhancing cross-modal learning.

Title: MACS: Multi-source Audio-to-image Generation with Contextual Significance and Semantic Alignment
Authors: Hao Zhou, Xiaobao Guo, Yuzhe Zhu, Adams Wai-Kin Kong
Abstract: Propelled by the breakthrough in deep generative models, audio-to-image generation has emerged as a pivotal cross-model task that converts complex auditory signals into rich visual representations. However, previous works only focus on single-source audio inputs for image generation, ignoring the multi-source characteristic in natural auditory scenes, thus limiting the performance in generating comprehensive visual content. To bridge this gap, a method called MACS is proposed to conduct multi-source audio-to-image generation. This is the first work that explicitly separates multi-source audio to capture the rich audio components before image generation. MACS is a two-stage method. In the first stage, multi-source audio inputs are separated by a weakly supervised method, where the audio and text labels are semantically aligned by casting into a common space using the large pre-trained CLAP model. We introduce a ranking loss to consider the contextual significance of the separated audio signals. In the second stage, efficient image generation is achieved by mapping the separated audio signals to the generation condition using only a trainable adapter and a MLP layer. We preprocess the LLP dataset as the first full multi-source audio-to-image generation benchmark. The experiments are conducted on multi-source, mixed-source, and single-source audio-to-image generation tasks. The proposed MACS outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in 17 of the 21 evaluation indexes on all tasks and delivers superior visual quality. The code will be publicly available.

Title: CODEI: Resource-Efficient Task-Driven Co-Design of Perception and Decision Making for Mobile Robots Applied to Autonomous Vehicles
Authors: Dejan Milojevic, Gioele Zardini, Miriam Elser, Andrea Censi, Emilio Frazzoli
Abstract: This paper discusses the integration challenges and strategies for designing mobile robots, by focusing on the task-driven, optimal selection of hardware and software to balance safety, efficiency, and minimal usage of resources such as costs, energy, computational requirements, and weight. We emphasize the interplay between perception and motion planning in decision-making by introducing the concept of occupancy queries to quantify the perception requirements for sampling-based motion planners. Sensor and algorithm performance are evaluated using False Negative Rates (FPR) and False Positive Rates (FPR) across various factors such as geometric relationships, object properties, sensor resolution, and environmental conditions. By integrating perception requirements with perception performance, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) approach is proposed for efficient sensor and algorithm selection and placement. This forms the basis for a co-design optimization that includes the robot body, motion planner, perception pipeline, and computing unit. We refer to this framework for solving the co-design problem of mobile robots as CODEI, short for Co-design of Embodied Intelligence. A case study on developing an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) for urban scenarios provides actionable information for designers, and shows that complex tasks escalate resource demands, with task performance affecting choices of the autonomy stack. The study demonstrates that resource prioritization influences sensor choice: cameras are preferred for cost-effective and lightweight designs, while lidar sensors are chosen for better energy and computational efficiency.

Title: Mirror Online Conformal Prediction with Intermittent Feedback
Authors: Bowen Wang, Matteo Zecchin, Osvaldo Simeone
Abstract: Online conformal prediction enables the runtime calibration of a pre-trained artificial intelligence model using feedback on its performance. Calibration is achieved through set predictions that are updated via online rules so as to ensure long-term coverage guarantees. While recent research has demonstrated the benefits of incorporating prior knowledge into the calibration process, this has come at the cost of replacing coverage guarantees with less tangible regret guarantees based on the quantile loss. This work introduces intermittent mirror online conformal prediction (IM-OCP), a novel runtime calibration framework that integrates prior knowledge, while maintaining long-term coverage and achieving sub-linear regret. IM-OCP features closed-form updates with minimal memory complexity, and is designed to operate under potentially intermittent feedback.

Title: Autonomous Robotic Radio Source Localization via a Novel Gaussian Mixture Filtering Approach
Authors: Sukkeun Kim, Sangwoo Moon, Ivan Petrunin, Hyo-Sang Shin, Shehryar Khattak
Abstract: This study proposes a new Gaussian Mixture Filter (GMF) to improve the estimation performance for the autonomous robotic radio signal source search and localization problem in unknown environments. The proposed filter is first tested with a benchmark numerical problem to validate the performance with other state-of-practice approaches such as Particle Gaussian Mixture (PGM) filters and Particle Filter (PF). Then the proposed approach is tested and compared against PF and PGM filters in real-world robotic field experiments to validate its impact for real-world robotic applications. The considered real-world scenarios have partial observability with the range-only measurement and uncertainty with the measurement model. The results show that the proposed filter can handle this partial observability effectively whilst showing improved performance compared to PF, reducing the computation requirements while demonstrating improved robustness over compared techniques.

Title: Safe exploration in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces
Authors: Abdullah Tokmak, Kiran G. Krishnan, Thomas B. Schön, Dominik Baumann
Abstract: Popular safe Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithms learn control policies for safety-critical systems in unknown environments. However, most algorithms make a smoothness assumption, which is encoded by a known bounded norm in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The RKHS is a potentially infinite-dimensional space, and it remains unclear how to reliably obtain the RKHS norm of an unknown function. In this work, we propose a safe BO algorithm capable of estimating the RKHS norm from data. We provide statistical guarantees on the RKHS norm estimation, integrate the estimated RKHS norm into existing confidence intervals and show that we retain theoretical guarantees, and prove safety of the resulting safe BO algorithm. We apply our algorithm to safely optimize reinforcement learning policies on physics simulators and on a real inverted pendulum, demonstrating improved performance, safety, and scalability compared to the state-of-the-art.

Title: BioSerenity-E1: a self-supervised EEG model for medical applications
Authors: Ruggero G. Bettinardi, Mohamed Rahmouni, Ulysse Gimenez
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) serves as an essential diagnostic tool in neurology; however, its accurate manual interpretation is a time-intensive process that demands highly specialized expertise, which remains relatively scarce and not consistently accessible. To address these limitations, the implementation of automated pre-screening and analysis systems for EEG data holds considerable promise. Advances in self-supervised learning made it possible to pre-train complex deep learning architectures on large volumes of unlabeled EEG data to learn generalizable representations, that can later be used to enhance performance on multiple tasks while needing less downstream data. In the present paper, we introduce BioSerenity-E1, the first of a family of self-supervised foundation models for clinical EEG applications that combines spectral tokenization with masked prediction to achieve state-of-the-art performance across relevant diagnostic tasks. The two-phase self-supervised pretraining framework initially acquires compressed EEG representations via a transformer-based VQ-VAE architecture designed to reconstruct log-multitaper spectral projections, then implements extensive (70% block) masked token prediction to force the model to learn complex spatiotemporal dependencies in EEG signals. BioSerenity-E1 achieves strong performance across three clinical tasks, either in line or above state-of-the-art methods: seizure detection (AUROC = 0.926, Sensitivity = 0.909), normal/abnormal classification (AUPRC = 0.970 on proprietary data; 0.910 on TUH-Abnormal), and multiclass pathology differentiation on unbalanced data (Weighted F1 = 0.730). The utility of BioSerenity-E1 is further confirmed in low-data regimes scenarios, showing clear improvements in AUPRC (from +2% to 17%) when trained on less than 10% of the available data.

Title: Compliant Control of Quadruped Robots for Assistive Load Carrying
Authors: Nimesh Khandelwal, Amritanshu Manu, Shakti S. Gupta, Mangal Kothari, Prashanth Krishnamurthy, Farshad Khorrami
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for assistive load carrying using quadruped robots. The controller uses proprioceptive sensor data to estimate external base wrench, that is used for precise control of the robot's acceleration during payload transport. The acceleration is controlled using a combination of admittance control and Control Barrier Function (CBF) based quadratic program (QP). The proposed controller rejects disturbances and maintains consistent performance under varying load conditions. Additionally, the built-in CBF guarantees collision avoidance with the collaborative agent in front of the robot. The efficacy of the overall controller is shown by its implementation on the physical hardware as well as numerical simulations. The proposed control framework aims to enhance the quadruped robot's ability to perform assistive tasks in various scenarios, from industrial applications to search and rescue operations.

Title: Whisper Speaker Identification: Leveraging Pre-Trained Multilingual Transformers for Robust Speaker Embeddings
Authors: Jakaria Islam Emon, Md Abu Salek, Kazi Tamanna Alam
Abstract: Speaker identification in multilingual settings presents unique challenges, particularly when conventional models are predominantly trained on English data. In this paper, we propose WSI (Whisper Speaker Identification), a framework that repurposes the encoder of the Whisper automatic speech recognition model pre trained on extensive multilingual data to generate robust speaker embeddings via a joint loss optimization strategy that leverages online hard triplet mining and self supervised Normalized Temperature-scaled Cross Entropy loss. By capitalizing on Whisper language-agnostic acoustic representations, our approach effectively distinguishes speakers across diverse languages and recording conditions. Extensive evaluations on multiple corpora, including VoxTube (multilingual), JVS (Japanese), CallHome (German, Spanish, Chinese, and Japanese), and Voxconverse (English), demonstrate that WSI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, namely Pyannote Embedding, ECAPA TDNN, and Xvector, in terms of lower equal error rates and higher AUC scores. These results validate our hypothesis that a multilingual pre-trained ASR encoder, combined with joint loss optimization, substantially improves speaker identification performance in non-English languages.

Title: Stratified Topological Autonomy for Long-Range Coordination (STALC)
Authors: Cora A. Dimmig, Adam Goertz, Adam Polevoy, Mark Gonzales, Kevin C. Wolfe, Bradley Woosley, John Rogers, Joseph Moore
Abstract: Achieving unified multi-robot coordination and motion planning in complex environments is a challenging problem. In this paper, we present a hierarchical approach to long-range coordination, which we call Stratified Topological Autonomy for Long-Range Coordination (STALC). In particular, we look at the problem of minimizing visibility to observers and maximizing safety with a multi-robot team navigating through a hazardous environment. At its core, our approach relies on the notion of a dynamic topological graph, where the edge weights vary dynamically based on the locations of the robots in the graph. To create this dynamic topological graph, we evaluate the visibility of the robot team from a discrete set of observer locations (both adversarial and friendly), and construct a topological graph whose edge weights depend on both adversary position and robot team configuration. We then impose temporal constraints on the evolution of those edge weights based on robot team state and use Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) to generate optimal multirobot plans through the graph. The visibility information also informs the lower layers of the autonomy stack to plan minimal visibility paths through the environment for the team of robots. Our approach presents methods to reduce the computational complexity for a team of robots that interact and coordinate across the team to accomplish a common goal. We demonstrate our approach in simulated and hardware experiments in forested and urban environments.

Title: AudioX: Diffusion Transformer for Anything-to-Audio Generation
Authors: Zeyue Tian, Yizhu Jin, Zhaoyang Liu, Ruibin Yuan, Xu Tan, Qifeng Chen, Wei Xue, Yike Guo
Abstract: Audio and music generation have emerged as crucial tasks in many applications, yet existing approaches face significant limitations: they operate in isolation without unified capabilities across modalities, suffer from scarce high-quality, multi-modal training data, and struggle to effectively integrate diverse inputs. In this work, we propose AudioX, a unified Diffusion Transformer model for Anything-to-Audio and Music Generation. Unlike previous domain-specific models, AudioX can generate both general audio and music with high quality, while offering flexible natural language control and seamless processing of various modalities including text, video, image, music, and audio. Its key innovation is a multi-modal masked training strategy that masks inputs across modalities and forces the model to learn from masked inputs, yielding robust and unified cross-modal representations. To address data scarcity, we curate two comprehensive datasets: vggsound-caps with 190K audio captions based on the VGGSound dataset, and V2M-caps with 6 million music captions derived from the V2M dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AudioX not only matches or outperforms state-of-the-art specialized models, but also offers remarkable versatility in handling diverse input modalities and generation tasks within a unified architecture.

Title: ESTformer: Transformer Utilizing Spatiotemporal Dependencies for Electroencaphalogram Super-resolution
Authors: Dongdong Li, Zhongliang Zeng, Zhe Wang, Hai Yang
Abstract: Towards practical applications of Electroencephalography (EEG), lightweight acquisition devices garner significant attention. However, EEG channel selection methods are commonly data-sensitive and cannot establish a unified sound paradigm for EEG acquisition devices. Through reverse conceptualisation, we formulated EEG applications in an EEG super-resolution (SR) manner, but suffered from high computation costs, extra interpolation bias, and few insights into spatiotemporal dependency modelling. To this end, we propose ESTformer, an EEG SR framework that utilises spatiotemporal dependencies based on the transformer. ESTformer applies positional encoding methods and a multihead self-attention mechanism to the space and time dimensions, which can learn spatial structural correlations and temporal functional variations. ESTformer, with the fixed mask strategy, adopts a mask token to upsample low-resolution (LR) EEG data in the case of disturbance from mathematical interpolation methods. On this basis, we designed various transformer blocks to construct a spatial interpolation module (SIM) and a temporal reconstruction module (TRM). Finally, ESTformer cascades the SIM and TRM to capture and model the spatiotemporal dependencies for EEG SR with fidelity. Extensive experimental results on two EEG datasets show the effectiveness of ESTformer against previous state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the versatility of the Transformer for EEG SR tasks. The superiority of the SR data was verified in an EEG-based person identification and emotion recognition task, achieving a 2% to 38% improvement compared with the LR data at different sampling scales.

Title: DeepThalamus: A novel deep learning method for automatic segmentation of brain thalamic nuclei from multimodal ultra-high resolution MRI
Authors: Marina Ruiz-Perez, Sergio Morell-Ortega, Marien Gadea, Roberto Vivo-Hernando, Gregorio Rubio, Fernando Aparici, Mariam de la Iglesia-Vaya, Thomas Tourdias, Pierrick Coupé, José V. Manjón
Abstract: The implication of the thalamus in multiple neurological pathologies makes it a structure of interest for volumetric analysis. In the present work, we have designed and implemented a multimodal volumetric deep neural network for the segmentation of thalamic nuclei at ultra-high resolution (0.125 mm3). Current tools either operate at standard resolution (1 mm3) or use monomodal data. To achieve the proposed objective, first, a database of semiautomatically segmented thalamic nuclei was created using ultra-high resolution T1, T2 and White Matter nulled (WMn) images. Then, a novel Deep learning based strategy was designed to obtain the automatic segmentations and trained to improve its robustness and accuaracy using a semisupervised approach. The proposed method was compared with a related state-of-the-art method showing competitive results both in terms of segmentation quality and efficiency. To make the proposed method fully available to the scientific community, a full pipeline able to work with monomodal standard resolution T1 images is also proposed.

Title: A Diffusion-Based Generative Equalizer for Music Restoration
Authors: Eloi Moliner, Maija Turunen, Filip Elvander, Vesa Välimäki
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to audio restoration, focusing on the enhancement of low-quality music recordings, and in particular historical ones. Building upon a previous algorithm called BABE, or Blind Audio Bandwidth Extension, we introduce BABE-2, which presents a series of improvements. This research broadens the concept of bandwidth extension to \emph{generative equalization}, a novel task that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been explicitly addressed in previous studies. BABE-2 is built around an optimization algorithm utilizing priors from diffusion models, which are trained or fine-tuned using a curated set of high-quality music tracks. The algorithm simultaneously performs two critical tasks: estimation of the filter degradation magnitude response and hallucination of the restored audio. The proposed method is objectively evaluated on historical piano recordings, showing an enhancement over the prior version. The method yields similarly impressive results in rejuvenating the works of renowned vocalists Enrico Caruso and Nellie Melba. This research represents an advancement in the practical restoration of historical music.

Title: ReLaX-VQA: Residual Fragment and Layer Stack Extraction for Enhancing Video Quality Assessment
Authors: Xinyi Wang, Angeliki Katsenou, David Bull
Abstract: With the rapid growth of User-Generated Content (UGC) exchanged between users and sharing platforms, the need for video quality assessment in the wild is increasingly evident. UGC is typically acquired using consumer devices and undergoes multiple rounds of compression (transcoding) before reaching the end user. Therefore, traditional quality metrics that employ the original content as a reference are not suitable. In this paper, we propose ReLaX-VQA, a novel No-Reference Video Quality Assessment (NR-VQA) model that aims to address the challenges of evaluating the quality of diverse video content without reference to the original uncompressed videos. ReLaX-VQA uses frame differences to select spatio-temporal fragments intelligently together with different expressions of spatial features associated with the sampled frames. These are then used to better capture spatial and temporal variabilities in the quality of neighbouring frames. Furthermore, the model enhances abstraction by employing layer-stacking techniques in deep neural network features from Residual Networks and Vision Transformers. Extensive testing across four UGC datasets demonstrates that ReLaX-VQA consistently outperforms existing NR-VQA methods, achieving an average SRCC of 0.8658 and PLCC of 0.8873. Open-source code and trained models that will facilitate further research and applications of NR-VQA can be found at this https URL.

Title: Joint Active and Passive Beamforming Design for IRS-aided MIMO ISAC Based on Sensing Mutual Information
Authors: Jin Li, Gui Zhou, Tantao Gong, Nan Liu, Rui Zhang
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)/reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system based on sensing mutual information (MI). Specifically, the base station (BS) perceives the sensing target via the reflected sensing signal by the IRS, while communicating with the users simultaneously. Our aim is to maximize the sensing MI, subject to the quality of service (QoS) constraints for all communication users, the transmit power constraint at the BS, and the unit-modulus constraint on the IRS's passive reflection. We solve this problem under two cases: one simplified case assuming a line-of-sight (LoS) channel between the BS and IRS and no clutter interference to sensing, and the other generalized case considering the Rician fading channel of the BS-IRS link and the presence of clutter interference to sensing. For the first case, we prove that the dedicated sensing beamformer is unnecessary for improving sensing MI and develop a low-complexity iterative algorithm to jointly optimize the BS and IRS active/passive beamformers. Then, for the second case, we propose an alternative iterative algorithm, which can also be applied to the first case, to solve the beamforming design problem under the general setup. Numerical results are provided to validate the performance of the proposed algorithms, as compared to various benchmark schemes.

Title: MambaFoley: Foley Sound Generation using Selective State-Space Models
Authors: Marco Furio Colombo, Francesca Ronchini, Luca Comanducci, Fabio Antonacci
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have led to widespread use of techniques for audio content generation, notably employing Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) across various tasks. Among these, Foley Sound Synthesis is of particular interest for its role in applications for the creation of multimedia content. Given the temporal-dependent nature of sound, it is crucial to design generative models that can effectively handle the sequential modeling of audio samples. Selective State Space Models (SSMs) have recently been proposed as a valid alternative to previously proposed techniques, demonstrating competitive performance with lower computational complexity. In this paper, we introduce MambaFoley, a diffusion-based model that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to leverage the recently proposed SSM known as Mamba for the Foley sound generation task. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we compare it with a state-of-the-art Foley sound generative model using both objective and subjective analyses.

Title: Constrained Learning for Decentralized Multi-Objective Coverage Control
Authors: Juan Cervino, Saurav Agarwal, Vijay Kumar, Alejandro Ribeiro
Abstract: The multi-objective coverage control problem requires a robot swarm to collaboratively provide sensor coverage to multiple heterogeneous importance density fields IDFs simultaneously. We pose this as an optimization problem with constraints and study two different formulations: (1) Fair coverage, where we minimize the maximum coverage cost for any field, promoting equitable resource distribution among all fields; and (2) Constrained coverage, where each field must be covered below a certain cost threshold, ensuring that critical areas receive adequate coverage according to predefined importance levels. We study the decentralized setting where robots have limited communication and local sensing capabilities, making the system more realistic, scalable, and robust. Given the complexity, we propose a novel decentralized constrained learning approach that combines primal-dual optimization with a Learnable Perception-Action-Communication (LPAC) neural network architecture. We show that the Lagrangian of the dual problem can be reformulated as a linear combination of the IDFs, enabling the LPAC policy to serve as a primal solver. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed method (i) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art decentralized controllers by 30% on average in terms of coverage cost, (ii) transfers well to larger environments with more robots, and (iii) scalable in the number of IDFs and robots in the swarm.

Title: A Framework for Holistic KLD-based Waveform Design for Multi-User-Multi-Target ISAC Systems
Authors: Yousef Kloob, Mohammad Al-Jarrah, Emad Alsusa
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework that leverages the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) metric to analyse and optimise performance trade-offs in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. We consider a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) base station that simultaneously serves communication user equipments (UEs) and detects multiple targets using a shared antenna deployment. We apply this framework to the widely used zero-forcing (ZF) communication beamforming technique, to assess their impact on the radar subsystem's performance. Additionally, two optimisation problems are formulated: the first optimise the radar subsystem's KLD under communication constraints, and the second focuses on communication waveform KLD optimisation with constraints on the radar KLD. These problems are solved using a projected gradient method with adaptive penalties for the radar waveforms and a gradient-assisted interior point method (IPM) for the communication waveforms. As performance benchmarks, we propose two additional optimisation frameworks: a radar waveform optimisation with bit error rate (BE) constraints and a communication waveform optimisation that minimises BER under radar KLD constraints. Theoretical derivations and simulations show that our KLD-based approach effectively characterises and optimises the ISAC performance trade-offs. Results indicate significant improvements in both radar detection and communication performance over conventional ZF beamforming and the identity covariance radar design, while achieving performance comparable to BER-based optimisation but with notably lower computational complexity. These findings highlight the advantages of KLD-based optimisation in balancing radar and communication performance for next-generation wireless networks.

Title: When Mamba Meets xLSTM: An Efficient and Precise Method with the xLSTM-VMUNet Model for Skin lesion Segmentation
Authors: Zhuoyi Fang, Jiajia Liu, Kexuan Shi, Qiang Han
Abstract: Automatic melanoma segmentation is essential for early skin cancer detection, yet challenges arise from the heterogeneity of melanoma, as well as interfering factors like blurred boundaries, low contrast, and imaging artifacts. While numerous algorithms have been developed to address these issues, previous approaches have often overlooked the need to jointly capture spatial and sequential features within dermatological images. This limitation hampers segmentation accuracy, especially in cases with indistinct borders or structurally similar lesions. Additionally, previous models lacked both a global receptive field and high computational efficiency. In this work, we present the xLSTM-VMUNet Model, which jointly capture spatial and sequential features within dermatological images successfully. xLSTM-VMUNet can not only specialize in extracting spatial features from images, focusing on the structural characteristics of skin lesions, but also enhance contextual understanding, allowing more effective handling of complex medical image structures. Experiment results on the ISIC2018 dataset demonstrate that xLSTM-VMUNet outperforms VMUNet by 4.85% on DSC and 6.41% on IoU on the ISIC2017 dataset, by 1.25% on DSC and 2.07% on IoU on the ISIC2018 dataset, with faster convergence and consistently high segmentation performance.

Title: Continuous K-space Recovery Network with Image Guidance for Fast MRI Reconstruction
Authors: Yucong Meng, Zhiwei Yang, Minghong Duan, Yonghong Shi, Zhijian Song
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial tool for clinical diagnosis while facing the challenge of long scanning time. To reduce the acquisition time, fast MRI reconstruction aims to restore high-quality images from the undersampled k-space. Existing methods typically train deep learning models to map the undersampled data to artifact-free MRI images. However, these studies often overlook the unique properties of k-space and directly apply general networks designed for image processing to k-space recovery, leaving the precise learning of k-space largely underexplored. In this work, we propose a continuous k-space recovery network from a new perspective of implicit neural representation with image domain guidance, which boosts the performance of MRI reconstruction. Specifically, (1) an implicit neural representation based encoder-decoder structure is customized to continuously query unsampled k-values. (2) an image guidance module is designed to mine the semantic information from the low-quality MRI images to further guide the k-space recovery. (3) a multi-stage training strategy is proposed to recover dense k-space progressively. Extensive experiments conducted on CC359, fastMRI, and IXI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and its superiority over other competitors.

Title: Optimal Distribution System Restoration via Tractable Modeling of Decision-Dependent Interruption Cost and Cold Load Pickup
Authors: Wei Wang, Minwu Chen, Hongbin Wang, Gaoqiang Peng, Hongzhou Chen
Abstract: Developing optimized restoration strategies for power distribution systems (PDSs) is critical to enhancing resilience. Prior knowledge of customer interruption cost (CIC) and load restoration behaviors, particularly cold load pickup (CLPU), is essential for effective decision-making. However, both CIC and CLPU are reciprocally influenced by the realized customer interruption duration (CID), making them decision-dependent and challenging to model, especially given the limited understanding of their underlying physical mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel and tractable modeling approach to capture the varying patterns of CIC and CLPU with CID - patterns derived from data that reflect observable surface - level correlations rather than underlying mechanisms - thereby enabling practical surrogate modeling of these decision-dependent factors. Specifically, quadratic functions are employed to model the increasing rate of CIC with respect to CID according to data fitting results. For CLPU, several defining characteristics are extracted and modeled in a piecewise linear form relative to CID, and the actual restored load accounting for CLPU is subsequently reconstructed. Building on these models, a PDS restoration optimization framework is developed, incorporating mobile energy storage systems (MESSs) and network reconfiguration strategies. Case studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and highlight MESS's unique potential in accelerating CLPU-related restoration.

Title: Fast MRI for All: Bridging Equity Gaps via Training without Raw Data Access
Authors: Yaşar Utku Alçalar, Merve Gülle, Mehmet Akçakaya
Abstract: Physics-driven deep learning (PD-DL) approaches have become popular for improved reconstruction of fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Though PD-DL offers higher acceleration rates than existing clinical fast MRI techniques, their use has been limited outside specialized MRI centers. A key challenge is generalization to underrepresented pathologies or populations, noted in multiple studies, with fine-tuning on target populations suggested for improvement. However, current approaches for PD-DL training require access to raw k-space measurements, which is typically only available at specialized MRI centers that have research agreements for such data access. This is especially an issue for rural and underserved areas, where commercial MRI scanners only provide access to a final reconstructed image. To tackle these challenges, we propose Compressibility-inspired Unsupervised Learning via Parallel Imaging Fidelity (CUPID) for high-quality PD-DL training using only routine clinical reconstructed images exported from an MRI scanner. CUPID evaluates output quality with a compressibility-based approach while ensuring that the output stays consistent with the clinical parallel imaging reconstruction through well-designed perturbations. Our results show CUPID achieves similar quality to established PD-DL training that requires k-space data while outperforming compressed sensing (CS) and diffusion-based generative methods. We further demonstrate its effectiveness in a zero-shot training setup for retrospectively and prospectively sub-sampled acquisitions, attesting to its minimal training burden. As an approach that radically deviates from existing strategies, CUPID presents an opportunity to provide equitable access to fast MRI for underserved populations in an attempt to reduce the inequalities associated with this expensive imaging modality.

Title: A General Sensing-assisted Channel Estimation Framework in Distributed MIMO Network
Authors: Hui Zhou, Xiaolan Liu, Sangarapillai Lambotharan
Abstract: In 6G communications, it is envisioned to equip the traditional access point (AP) with sensing capability to fully benefit the existing wireless communication infrastructures. Thus, sensing-assisted communication has attracted significant attention from both industry and academia. However, most existing works focused on sensing-assisted communication in line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios due to sensing limitations, where the sensing target (ST) and communication user equipment (UE) remain the same. In this paper, we propose a general sensing-assisted channel estimation framework in the distributed multiple-input and multiple-output (DMIMO) network and consider a scenario where the ST and UE are different entities. In addition, ST is a moving target (e.g. a robot) which causes channels between APs and UEs to vary due to changes in the reflection paths of the indoor environment. Therefore, we let multiple APs to jointly sense the position of the ST, which will be incorporated in a Ray tracing model to obtain a more accurate estimate of the channels from APs to UEs for both the LoS and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed sensing-assisted communication framework achieves a much higher channel estimation accuracy and downlink throughput compared to the traditional least-square (LS) channel estimation. More importantly, the feasibility of the proposed framework has been validated to guarantee the stringent channel estimation accuracy requirement in the DMIMO network.

Title: Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-Aided FDD Precoding with Sensing Heterogeneity: A Vertical Federated Learning Approach
Authors: Haotian Zhang, Shijian Gao, Weibo Wen, Xiang Cheng
Abstract: High complexity in precoding design for frequency division duplex systems necessitates streamlined solutions. Guided by Synesthesia of Machines (SoM), this paper introduces a heterogeneous multi-vehicle, multi-modal sensing aided precoding scheme within a vertical federated learning (VFL) framework, which significantly minimizes pilot sequence length while optimizing the system's sum rate. We address the challenges posed by local data heterogeneity due to varying on-board sensor configurations through a meticulously designed VFL training procedure. To extract valuable channel features from multi-modal sensing, we employ three distinct data preprocessing methods that convert raw data into informative representations relevant for precoding. Additionally, we propose an online training strategy based on VFL framework, enabling the scheme to adapt dynamically to fluctuations in user numbers. Numerical results indicate that our approach, utilizing short pilot sequences, closely approximates the performance of traditional optimization methods with perfect channel state information.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce holiAtlas, a holistic, multimodal and high-resolution human brain atlas. This atlas covers different levels of details of the human brain anatomy, from the organ to the substructure level, using a new dense labelled protocol generated from the fusion of multiple local protocols at different scales. This atlas has been constructed averaging images and segmentations of 75 healthy subjects from the Human Connectome Project database. Specifically, MR images of T1, T2 and WMn (White Matter nulled) contrasts at 0.125 $mm^{3}$ resolution that were nonlinearly registered and averaged using symmetric group-wise normalisation to construct the atlas. At the finest level, the holiAtlas protocol has 350 different labels derived from 10 different delineation protocols. These labels were grouped at different scales to provide a holistic view of the brain at different levels in a coherent and consistent manner. This multiscale and multimodal atlas can be used for the development of new ultra-high resolution segmentation methods that can potentially leverage the early detection of neurological disorders.

Title: KAN-powered large-target detection for automotive radar
Authors: Vinay Kulkarni, V. V. Reddy, Neha Maheshwari
Abstract: This paper presents a novel radar signal detection pipeline focused on detecting large targets such as cars and SUVs. Traditional methods, such as Ordered-Statistic Constant False Alarm Rate (OS-CFAR), commonly used in automotive radar, are designed for point or isotropic target models. These may not adequately capture the Range-Doppler (RD) scattering patterns of larger targets, especially in high-resolution radar systems. Additional modules such as association and tracking are necessary to refine and consolidate the detections over multiple dwells. To address these limitations, we propose a detection technique based on the probability density function (pdf) of RD segments, leveraging the Kolmogorov-Arnold neural network (KAN) to learn the data and generate interpretable symbolic expressions for binary hypotheses. Beside the Monte-Carlo study showing better performance for the proposed KAN expression over OS-CFAR, it is shown to exhibit a probability of detection (PD) of 96% when transfer learned with field data. The false alarm rate (PFA) is comparable with OS-CFAR designed with PFA = $10^{-6}$. Additionally, the study also examines impact of the number of pdf bins representing RD segment on performance of the KAN-based detection.

Abstract: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging offers diverse contrasts for non-invasive assessment of cardiac function and myocardial characterization. However, CMR often requires the acquisition of many contrasts, and each contrast takes a considerable amount of time. The extended acquisition time will further increase the susceptibility to motion artifacts. Existing deep learning-based reconstruction methods have been proven to perform well in image reconstruction tasks, but most of them are designed for specific acquisition modality or dedicated imaging parameter, which limits their ability to generalize across a variety of scan scenarios. To address this issue, the CMRxRecon2024 challenge consists of two specific tasks: Task 1 focuses on a modality-universal setting, evaluating the out-of-distribution generalization of existing learning-based models, while Task 2 follows a k-space sampling-universal setting, assessing the all-in-one adaptability of universal models. Main contributions of this challenge include providing the largest publicly available multi-modality, multi-view cardiac k-space dataset; and developing an open benchmarking platform for algorithm evaluation and shared code library for data processing. In addition, through a detailed analysis of the results submitted to the challenge, we have also made several findings, including: 1) adaptive prompt-learning embedding is an effective means for achieving strong generalization in reconstruction models; 2) enhanced data consistency based on physics-informed networks is also an effective pathway toward a universal model; 3) traditional evaluation metrics have limitations when assessing ground-truth references with moderate or lower image quality, highlighting the need for subjective evaluation methods. This challenge attracted 200 participants from 18 countries, aimed at promoting their translation into clinical practice.

Title: Quantitative Decentralized Stability Certificates for Grid-Forming Converter Control
Authors: Verena Häberle, Xiuqiang He, Linbin Huang, Florian Dörfler, Steven Low
Abstract: We propose a decentralized framework for guaranteeing the small-signal stability of future power systems with grid-forming converters. Our approach leverages dynamic loop-shifting techniques to compensate for the lack of passivity in the network dynamics and establishes decentralized parametric stability certificates, depending on the local device-level controls and incorporating the effects of the network dynamics. By following practical tuning rules, we are able to ensure plug-and-play operation without centralized coordination. Unlike prior works, our approach accommodates coupled frequency and voltage dynamics, incorporates network dynamics, and does not rely on specific network configurations or operating points, offering a general and scalable solution for the integration of power-electronics-based devices into future power systems. We validate our theoretical stability results through numerical case studies in a high-fidelity simulation model.

Title: Game Theory in Formula 1: Multi-agent Physical and Strategical Interactions
Authors: Giona Fieni, Marc-Philippe Neumann, Francesca Furia, Alessandro Caucino, Alberto Cerofolini, Vittorio Ravaglioli, Christopher H. Onder
Abstract: This paper presents an optimization framework for Formula 1 racing that integrates multi-agent interactions, aerodynamic wake effects, trajectory optimization, and energy management. By employing game-theoretic methods, we formulate the minimum lap time problem as either a Nash or a Stackelberg game. Exploiting their structural similarities, we compare symmetric and hierarchical strategies to analyze competitive racing dynamics and strategic dominance. Additionally, we introduce an algorithm to refine local Stackelberg solutions. Our findings underscore the importance of jointly optimizing physical interactions, energy management, and trajectory, highlighting their strong interdependence. We examine the impact of slipstreaming on trajectory selection in corners, straights, and high-speed sections, while also identifying optimal overtaking locations based on energy allocation strategies. By incorporating a physically accurate interaction model and accounting for the optimal responses of competing agents, our approach reveals characteristic strategic behaviors observed in real-world racing. The proposed methodology contributes towards realistic Formula 1 race strategy optimizations, with potential applications in motorsport engineering and autonomous racing.

Title: X-GAN: A Generative AI-Powered Unsupervised Model for High-Precision Segmentation of Retinal Main Vessels toward Early Detection of Glaucoma
Authors: Cheng Huang, Weizheng Xie, Tsengdar J. Lee, Jui-Kai Wang, Karanjit Kooner, Jia Zhang
Abstract: Structural changes in main retinal blood vessels serve as critical biomarkers for the onset and progression of glaucoma. Identifying these vessels is vital for vascular modeling yet highly challenging. This paper proposes X-GAN, a generative AI-powered unsupervised segmentation model designed for extracting main blood vessels from Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) images. The process begins with the Space Colonization Algorithm (SCA) to rapidly generate a skeleton of vessels, featuring their radii. By synergistically integrating generative adversarial networks (GANs) with biostatistical modeling of vessel radii, X-GAN enables a fast reconstruction of both 2D and 3D representations of the vessels. Based on this reconstruction, X-GAN achieves nearly 100\% segmentation accuracy without relying on labeled data or high-performance computing resources. Also, to address the Issue, data scarity, we introduce GSS-RetVein, a high-definition mixed 2D and 3D glaucoma retinal dataset. GSS-RetVein provides a rigorous benchmark due to its exceptionally clear capillary structures, introducing controlled noise for testing model robustness. Its 2D images feature sharp capillary boundaries, while its 3D component enhances vascular reconstruction and blood flow prediction, supporting glaucoma progression simulations. Experimental results confirm GSS-RetVein's superiority in evaluating main vessel segmentation compared to existing datasets. Code and dataset are here: this https URL.

Title: Faithful and Privacy-Preserving Implementation of Average Consensus
Authors: Kaoru Teranishi, Kiminao Kogiso, Takashi Tanaka
Abstract: We propose a protocol based on mechanism design theory and encrypted control to solve average consensus problems among rational and strategic agents while preserving their privacy. The proposed protocol provides a mechanism that incentivizes the agents to faithfully implement the intended behavior specified in the protocol. Furthermore, the protocol runs over encrypted data using homomorphic encryption and secret sharing to protect the privacy of agents. We also analyze the security of the proposed protocol using a simulation paradigm in secure multi-party computation. The proposed protocol demonstrates that mechanism design and encrypted control can complement each other to achieve security under rational adversaries.

Authors: Qi Wu, Zeping Sui, Hien Quoc Ngo, Qun Wan, Michail Matthaiou
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the joint generalized channel estimation and device identification problem in Internet of Things (IoT) networks {under multipath propagation}. To fully utilize the received signal, we decompose the generalized channel into three components: transmitter hardware characteristics, path gains, and angles of arrival. By modelling the received signals as parallel factor (PARAFAC) tensors, we develop alternating least squares (ALS)-based algorithms to simultaneously estimate the generalized channels and identify the transmitters. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms {both Khatri-Rao Factorization (KRF) and the conventional least squares (LS) method} in terms of channel estimation accuracy and achieves performance close to the derived Cramer-Rao lower bound.

Title: The R2D2 Deep Neural Network Series for Scalable Non-Cartesian Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Authors: Yiwei Chen, Amir Aghabiglou, Shijie Chen, Motahare Torki, Chao Tang, Ruud B. van Heeswijk, Yves Wiaux
Abstract: We introduce the R2D2 Deep Neural Network (DNN) series paradigm for fast and scalable image reconstruction from highly-accelerated non-Cartesian k-space acquisitions in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). While unrolled DNN architectures provide a robust image formation approach via data-consistency layers, embedding non-uniform fast Fourier transform operators in a DNN can become impractical to train at large scale, e.g in 2D MRI with a large number of coils, or for higher-dimensional imaging. Plug-and-play approaches that alternate a learned denoiser blind to the measurement setting with a data-consistency step are not affected by this limitation but their highly iterative nature implies slow reconstruction. To address this scalability challenge, we leverage the R2D2 paradigm that was recently introduced to enable ultra-fast reconstruction for large-scale Fourier imaging in radio astronomy. R2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images iteratively estimated as outputs of DNN modules taking the previous iteration's data residual as input. The method can be interpreted as a learned version of the Matching Pursuit algorithm. A series of R2D2 DNN modules were sequentially trained in a supervised manner on the fastMRI dataset and validated for 2D multi-coil MRI in simulation and on real data, targeting highly under-sampled radial k-space sampling. Results suggest that a series with only few DNNs achieves superior reconstruction quality over its unrolled incarnation R2D2-Net (whose training is also much less scalable), and over the state-of-the-art diffusion-based "Decomposed Diffusion Sampler" approach (also characterised by a slower reconstruction process).

Title: Feasible Policy Iteration for Safe Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Yujie Yang, Zhilong Zheng, Shengbo Eben Li, Wei Xu, Jingjing Liu, Xianyuan Zhan, Ya-Qin Zhang
Abstract: Safety is the priority concern when applying reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to real-world control problems. While policy iteration provides a fundamental algorithm for standard RL, an analogous theoretical algorithm for safe RL remains absent. In this paper, we propose feasible policy iteration (FPI), the first foundational dynamic programming algorithm for safe RL. FPI alternates between policy evaluation, region identification and policy improvement. This follows actor-critic-scenery (ACS) framework where scenery refers to a feasibility function that represents a feasible region. A region-wise update rule is developed for the policy improvement step, which maximizes state-value function inside the feasible region and minimizes feasibility function outside it. With this update rule, FPI guarantees monotonic expansion of feasible region, monotonic improvement of state-value function, and geometric convergence to the optimal safe policy. Experimental results demonstrate that FPI achieves strictly zero constraint violation on low-dimensional tasks and outperforms existing methods in constraint adherence and reward performance on high-dimensional tasks.

Title: Networked Communication for Decentralised Agents in Mean-Field Games
Authors: Patrick Benjamin, Alessandro Abate
Abstract: We introduce networked communication to the mean-field game framework, in particular to oracle-free settings where $N$ decentralised agents learn along a single, non-episodic run of the empirical system. We prove that our architecture has sample guarantees bounded between those of the centralised- and independent-learning cases. We provide the order of the difference in these bounds in terms of network structure and number of communication rounds, and also contribute a policy-update stability guarantee. We discuss how the sample guarantees of the three theoretical algorithms do not actually result in practical convergence. We therefore show that in practical settings where the theoretical parameters are not observed (leading to poor estimation of the Q-function), our communication scheme considerably accelerates learning over the independent case, often performing similarly to a centralised learner while removing the restrictive assumption of the latter. We contribute further practical enhancements to all three theoretical algorithms, allowing us to present their first empirical demonstrations. Our experiments confirm that we can remove several of the theoretical assumptions of the algorithms, and display the empirical convergence benefits brought by our new networked communication. We additionally show that our networked approach has significant advantages over both alternatives in terms of robustness to update failures and to changes in population size.

Title: Real-Time Recurrent Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Julian Lemmel, Radu Grosu
Abstract: We introduce a biologically plausible RL framework for solving tasks in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). The proposed algorithm combines three integral parts: (1) A Meta-RL architecture, resembling the mammalian basal ganglia; (2) A biologically plausible reinforcement learning algorithm, exploiting temporal difference learning and eligibility traces to train the policy and the value-function; (3) An online automatic differentiation algorithm for computing the gradients with respect to parameters of a shared recurrent network backbone. Our experimental results show that the method is capable of solving a diverse set of partially observable reinforcement learning tasks. The algorithm we call real-time recurrent reinforcement learning (RTRRL) serves as a model of learning in biological neural networks, mimicking reward pathways in the basal ganglia.

Title: Networked Communication for Mean-Field Games with Function Approximation and Empirical Mean-Field Estimation
Authors: Patrick Benjamin, Alessandro Abate
Abstract: Recent algorithms allow decentralised agents, possibly connected via a communication network, to learn equilibria in Mean-Field Games from a non-episodic run of the empirical system. However, these algorithms are for tabular settings: this computationally limits the size of agents' observation space, meaning the algorithms cannot handle anything but small state spaces, nor generalise beyond policies depending only on the agent's local state to so-called 'population-dependent' policies. We address this limitation by introducing function approximation to the existing setting, drawing on the Munchausen Online Mirror Descent method that has previously been employed only in finite-horizon, episodic, centralised settings. While this permits us to include the mean field in the observation for players' policies, it is unrealistic to assume decentralised agents have access to this global information: we therefore also provide new algorithms allowing agents to locally estimate the global empirical distribution, and to improve this estimate via inter-agent communication. We show theoretically that exchanging policy information helps networked agents outperform both independent and even centralised agents in function-approximation settings. Our experiments demonstrate this happening empirically, by an even greater margin than in tabular settings, and show that the communication network allows decentralised agents to estimate the mean field for population-dependent policies.

Title: Quantifying Aleatoric and Epistemic Dynamics Uncertainty via Local Conformal Calibration
Authors: Luís Marques, Dmitry Berenson
Abstract: Whether learned, simulated, or analytical, approximations of a robot's dynamics can be inaccurate when encountering novel environments. Many approaches have been proposed to quantify the aleatoric uncertainty of such methods, i.e. uncertainty resulting from stochasticity, however these estimates alone are not enough to properly estimate the uncertainty of a model in a novel environment, where the actual dynamics can change. Such changes can induce epistemic uncertainty, i.e. uncertainty due to a lack of information/data. Accounting for both epistemic and aleatoric dynamics uncertainty in a theoretically-grounded way remains an open problem. We introduce Local Uncertainty Conformal Calibration (LUCCa), a conformal prediction-based approach that calibrates the aleatoric uncertainty estimates provided by dynamics models to generate probabilistically-valid prediction regions of the system's state. We account for both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty non-asymptotically, without strong assumptions about the form of the true dynamics or how it changes. The calibration is performed locally in the state-action space, leading to uncertainty estimates that are useful for planning. We validate our method by constructing probabilistically-safe plans for a double-integrator under significant changes in dynamics.

Title: Underapproximating Safe Domains of Attraction for Discrete-Time Systems Using Implicit Representations of Backward Reachable Sets
Authors: Mohamed Serry, Jun Liu
Abstract: Analyzing and certifying stability and attractivity of nonlinear systems is a topic of research interest that has been extensively investigated by control theorists and engineers for many years. Despite that, accurately estimating domains of attraction for nonlinear systems remains a challenging task, where available estimation approaches are either conservative or limited to low-dimensional systems. In this work, we propose an iterative approach to accurately underapproximate safe (i.e., state-constrained) domains of attraction for general discrete-time autonomous nonlinear systems. Our approach relies on implicit representations of safe backward reachable sets of safe regions of attraction, where such regions can be be easily constructed using, e.g., quadratic Lyapunov functions. The iterations of our approach are monotonic (in the sense of set inclusion), where each iteration results in a safe region of attraction, given as a sublevel set, that underapproximates the safe domain of attraction. The sublevel set representations of the resulting regions of attraction can be efficiently utilized in verifying the inclusion of given points of interest in the safe domain of attraction. We illustrate our approach through two numerical examples, involving two- and four-dimensional nonlinear systems.

Title: Maintaining Strong $r$-Robustness in Reconfigurable Multi-Robot Networks using Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Haejoon Lee, Dimitra Panagou
Abstract: In leader-follower consensus, strong $r$-robustness of the communication graph provides a sufficient condition for followers to achieve consensus in the presence of misbehaving agents. Previous studies have assumed that robots can form and/or switch between predetermined network topologies with known robustness properties. However, robots with distance-based communication models may not be able to achieve these topologies while moving through spatially constrained environments, such as narrow corridors, to complete their objectives. This paper introduces a Control Barrier Function (CBF) that ensures robots maintain strong $r$-robustness of their communication graph above a certain threshold without maintaining any fixed topologies. Our CBF directly addresses robustness, allowing robots to have flexible reconfigurable network structure while navigating to achieve their objectives. The efficacy of our method is tested through various simulation and hardware experiments.

Title: Coalescing Force of Group Pressure: Consensus in Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics
Authors: Iryna Zabarianska, Anton V. Proskurnikov
Abstract: This work extends the recent opinion dynamics model from Cheng et al., emphasizing the role of group pressure in consensus formation. We generalize the findings to incorporate social influence algorithms with general time-varying, opinion-dependent weights and multidimensional opinions, beyond bounded confidence dynamics. We demonstrate that, with uniformly positive conformity levels, group pressure consistently drives consensus and provide a tighter estimate for the convergence rate. Unlike previous models, the common public opinion in our framework can assume arbitrary forms within the convex hull of current opinions, offering flexibility applicable to real-world scenarios such as opinion polls with random participant selection. This analysis provides deeper insights into how group pressure mechanisms foster consensus under diverse conditions.

Title: Joint Fine-tuning and Conversion of Pretrained Speech and Language Models towards Linear Complexity
Authors: Mutian He, Philip N. Garner
Abstract: Architectures such as Linformer and Mamba have recently emerged as competitive linear time replacements for transformers. However, corresponding large pretrained models are often unavailable, especially in non-text domains. To remedy this, we present a Cross-Architecture Layerwise Distillation (CALD) approach that jointly converts a transformer model to a linear time substitute and fine-tunes it to a target task. We also compare several means to guide the fine-tuning to optimally retain the desired inference capability from the original model. The methods differ in their use of the target model and the trajectory of the parameters. In a series of empirical studies on language processing, language modeling, and speech processing, we show that CALD can effectively recover the result of the original model, and that the guiding strategy contributes to the result. Some reasons for the variation are suggested.

Title: Safe and Dynamically-Feasible Motion Planning using Control Lyapunov and Barrier Functions
Authors: Pol Mestres, Carlos Nieto-Granda, Jorge Cortés
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of designing motion planning algorithms for control-affine systems that generate collision-free paths from an initial to a final destination and can be executed using safe and dynamically-feasible controllers. We introduce the C-CLF-CBF-RRT algorithm, which produces paths with such properties and leverages rapidly exploring random trees (RRTs), control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) and control barrier functions (CBFs). We show that C-CLF-CBF-RRT is computationally efficient for linear systems with polytopic and ellipsoidal constraints, and establish its probabilistic completeness. We showcase the performance of C-CLF-CBF-RRT in different simulation and hardware experiments.

Title: AI-Aided Kalman Filters
Authors: Nir Shlezinger, Guy Revach, Anubhab Ghosh, Saikat Chatterjee, Shuo Tang, Tales Imbiriba, Jindrich Dunik, Ondrej Straka, Pau Closas, Yonina C. Eldar
Abstract: The Kalman filter (KF) and its variants are among the most celebrated algorithms in signal processing. These methods are used for state estimation of dynamic systems by relying on mathematical representations in the form of simple state-space (SS) models, which may be crude and inaccurate descriptions of the underlying dynamics. Emerging data-centric artificial intelligence (AI) techniques tackle these tasks using deep neural networks (DNNs), which are model-agnostic. Recent developments illustrate the possibility of fusing DNNs with classic Kalman-type filtering, obtaining systems that learn to track in partially known dynamics. This article provides a tutorial-style overview of design approaches for incorporating AI in aiding KF-type algorithms. We review both generic and dedicated DNN architectures suitable for state estimation, and provide a systematic presentation of techniques for fusing AI tools with KFs and for leveraging partial SS modeling and data, categorizing design approaches into task-oriented and SS model-oriented. The usefulness of each approach in preserving the individual strengths of model-based KFs and data-driven DNNs is investigated in a qualitative and quantitative study, whose code is publicly available, illustrating the gains of hybrid model-based/data-driven designs. We also discuss existing challenges and future research directions that arise from fusing AI and Kalman-type algorithms.

Title: U-Motion: Learned Point Cloud Video Compression with U-Structured Motion Estimation
Authors: Tingyu Fan, Yueyu Hu, Ran Gong, Yao Wang
Abstract: Point cloud video (PCV) is a versatile 3D representation of dynamic scenes with emerging applications. This paper introduces U-Motion, a learning-based compression scheme for both PCV geometry and attributes. We propose a U-Structured inter-frame prediction framework, U-Inter, which performs explicit motion estimation and compensation (ME/MC) at different scales with varying levels of detail. It integrates Top-Down (Fine-to-Coarse) Motion Propagation, Bottom-Up Motion Predictive Coding and Multi-scale Group Motion Compensation to enable accurate motion estimation and efficient motion compression at each scale. In addition, we design a multi-scale spatial-temporal predictive coding module to capture the cross-scale spatial redundancy remaining after U-Inter prediction. We conduct experiments following the MPEG Common Test Condition for dense dynamic point clouds and demonstrate that U-Motion can achieve significant gains over MPEG G-PCC-GesTM v3.0 and recently published learning-based methods for both geometry and attribute compression.

Title: Real-Time Decision-Making for Digital Twin in Additive Manufacturing with Model Predictive Control using Time-Series Deep Neural Networks
Authors: Yi-Ping Chen, Vispi Karkaria, Ying-Kuan Tsai, Faith Rolark, Daniel Quispe, Robert X. Gao, Jian Cao, Wei Chen
Abstract: Digital Twin -- a virtual replica of a physical system enabling real-time monitoring, model updating, prediction, and decision-making -- combined with recent advances in machine learning, offers new opportunities for proactive control strategies in autonomous manufacturing. However, achieving real-time decision-making with Digital Twins requires efficient optimization driven by accurate predictions of highly nonlinear manufacturing systems. This paper presents a simultaneous multi-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for real-time decision-making, using a multivariate deep neural network, named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE), as the surrogate model. Unlike conventional MPC models which only provide one-step ahead prediction, TiDE is capable of predicting future states within the prediction horizon in one shot (multi-step), significantly accelerating the MPC. Using Directed Energy Deposition (DED) additive manufacturing as a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPC in achieving melt pool temperature tracking to ensure part quality, while reducing porosity defects by regulating laser power to maintain melt pool depth constraints. In this work, we first show that TiDE is capable of accurately predicting melt pool temperature and depth. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed MPC achieves precise temperature tracking while satisfying melt pool depth constraints within a targeted dilution range (10\%-30\%), reducing potential porosity defects. Compared to PID controller, the MPC results in smoother and less fluctuating laser power profiles with competitive or superior melt pool temperature control performance. This demonstrates the MPC's proactive control capabilities, leveraging time-series prediction and real-time optimization, positioning it as a powerful tool for future Digital Twin applications and real-time process optimization in manufacturing.

Title: Audio-Visual Deepfake Detection With Local Temporal Inconsistencies
Authors: Marcella Astrid, Enjie Ghorbel, Djamila Aouada
Abstract: This paper proposes an audio-visual deepfake detection approach that aims to capture fine-grained temporal inconsistencies between audio and visual modalities. To achieve this, both architectural and data synthesis strategies are introduced. From an architectural perspective, a temporal distance map, coupled with an attention mechanism, is designed to capture these inconsistencies while minimizing the impact of irrelevant temporal subsequences. Moreover, we explore novel pseudo-fake generation techniques to synthesize local inconsistencies. Our approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art methods using the DFDC and FakeAVCeleb datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting audio-visual deepfakes.

Title: HOPS: High-order Polynomials with Self-supervised Dimension Reduction for Load Forecasting
Authors: Pengyang Song, Han Feng, Shreyashi Shukla, Jue Wang, Tao Hong
Abstract: Load forecasting is a fundamental task in smart grid. Many techniques have been applied to developing load forecasting models. Due to the challenges such as the Curse of Dimensionality, overfitting, and limited computing resources, multivariate higher-order polynomial models have received limited attention in load forecasting, despite their desirable mathematical foundations and optimization properties. In this paper, we propose low rank approximation and self-supervised dimension reduction to address the aforementioned issues. To further improve computational efficiency, we also utilize a fast Conjugate Gradient based algorithm for the proposed polynomial models. Based on the load datasets from the ISO New England, the proposed method high-order polynomials with self-supervised dimension reduction (HOPS) demonstrates higher forecasting accuracy over several competitive models. Additionally, experimental results indicate that our approach alleviates redundant variable construction, achieving better forecasts with fewer input variables.

Title: NotaGen: Advancing Musicality in Symbolic Music Generation with Large Language Model Training Paradigms
Authors: Yashan Wang, Shangda Wu, Jianhuai Hu, Xingjian Du, Yueqi Peng, Yongxin Huang, Shuai Fan, Xiaobing Li, Feng Yu, Maosong Sun
Abstract: We introduce NotaGen, a symbolic music generation model aiming to explore the potential of producing high-quality classical sheet music. Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), NotaGen adopts pre-training, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning paradigms (henceforth referred to as the LLM training paradigms). It is pre-trained on 1.6M pieces of music in ABC notation, and then fine-tuned on approximately 9K high-quality classical compositions conditioned on "period-composer-instrumentation" prompts. For reinforcement learning, we propose the CLaMP-DPO method, which further enhances generation quality and controllability without requiring human annotations or predefined rewards. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of CLaMP-DPO in symbolic music generation models with different architectures and encoding schemes. Furthermore, subjective A/B tests show that NotaGen outperforms baseline models against human compositions, greatly advancing musical aesthetics in symbolic music generation.

Title: Video Super-Resolution: All You Need is a Video Diffusion Model
Authors: Zhihao Zhan, Wang Pang, Xiang Zhu, Yechao Bai
Abstract: We present a generic video super-resolution algorithm in this paper, based on the Diffusion Posterior Sampling framework with an unconditional video generation model in latent space. The video generation model, a diffusion transformer, functions as a space-time model. We argue that a powerful model, which learns the physics of the real world, can easily handle various kinds of motion patterns as prior knowledge, thus eliminating the need for explicit estimation of optical flows or motion parameters for pixel alignment. Furthermore, a single instance of the proposed video diffusion transformer model can adapt to different sampling conditions without re-training. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method has strong capabilities to address video super-resolution challenges.

Title: Bimodal Connection Attention Fusion for Speech Emotion Recognition
Authors: Jiachen Luo, Huy Phan, Lin Wang, Joshua D. Reiss
Abstract: Multi-modal emotion recognition is challenging due to the difficulty of extracting features that capture subtle emotional differences. Understanding multi-modal interactions and connections is key to building effective bimodal speech emotion recognition systems. In this work, we propose Bimodal Connection Attention Fusion (BCAF) method, which includes three main modules: the interactive connection network, the bimodal attention network, and the correlative attention network. The interactive connection network uses an encoder-decoder architecture to model modality connections between audio and text while leveraging modality-specific features. The bimodal attention network enhances semantic complementation and exploits intra- and inter-modal interactions. The correlative attention network reduces cross-modal noise and captures correlations between audio and text. Experiments on the MELD and IEMOCAP datasets demonstrate that the proposed BCAF method outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines.

Title: The Algorithmic State Architecture (ASA): An Integrated Framework for AI-Enabled Government
Authors: Zeynep Engin, Jon Crowcroft, David Hand, Philip Treleaven
Abstract: As artificial intelligence transforms public sector operations, governments struggle to integrate technological innovations into coherent systems for effective service delivery. This paper introduces the Algorithmic State Architecture (ASA), a novel four-layer framework conceptualising how Digital Public Infrastructure, Data-for-Policy, Algorithmic Government/Governance, and GovTech interact as an integrated system in AI-enabled states. Unlike approaches that treat these as parallel developments, ASA positions them as interdependent layers with specific enabling relationships and feedback mechanisms. Through comparative analysis of implementations in Estonia, Singapore, India, and the UK, we demonstrate how foundational digital infrastructure enables systematic data collection, which powers algorithmic decision-making processes, ultimately manifesting in user-facing services. Our analysis reveals that successful implementations require balanced development across all layers, with particular attention to integration mechanisms between them. The framework contributes to both theory and practice by bridging previously disconnected domains of digital government research, identifying critical dependencies that influence implementation success, and providing a structured approach for analysing the maturity and development pathways of AI-enabled government systems.

Title: PCLA: A Framework for Testing Autonomous Agents in the CARLA Simulator
Authors: Masoud Jamshidiyan Tehrani, Jinhan Kim, Paolo Tonella
Abstract: Recent research on testing autonomous driving agents has grown significantly, especially in simulation environments. The CARLA simulator is often the preferred choice, and the autonomous agents from the CARLA Leaderboard challenge are regarded as the best-performing agents within this environment. However, researchers who test these agents, rather than training their own ones from scratch, often face challenges in utilizing them within customized test environments and scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce PCLA (Pretrained CARLA Leaderboard Agents), an open-source Python testing framework that includes nine high-performing pre-trained autonomous agents from the Leaderboard challenges. PCLA is the first infrastructure specifically designed for testing various autonomous agents in arbitrary CARLA environments/scenarios. PCLA provides a simple way to deploy Leaderboard agents onto a vehicle without relying on the Leaderboard codebase, it allows researchers to easily switch between agents without requiring modifications to CARLA versions or programming environments, and it is fully compatible with the latest version of CARLA while remaining independent of the Leaderboard's specific CARLA version. PCLA is publicly accessible at this https URL.
