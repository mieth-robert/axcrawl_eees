Title: Comparative Analysis of Hand-Crafted and Machine-Driven Histopathological Features for Prostate Cancer Classification and Segmentation
Authors: Feda Bolus Al Baqain, Omar Sultan Al-Kadi
Abstract: Histopathological image analysis is a reliable method for prostate cancer identification. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of two approaches for segmenting glandular structures in prostate images to automate Gleason grading. The first approach utilizes a hand-crafted learning technique, combining Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) texture descriptors to highlight spatial dependencies and minimize information loss at the pixel level. For machine driven feature extraction, we employ a U-Net convolutional neural network to perform semantic segmentation of prostate gland stroma tissue. Support vector machine-based learning of hand-crafted features achieves impressive classification accuracies of 99.0% and 95.1% for GLCM and LBP, respectively, while the U-Net-based machine-driven features attain 94% accuracy. Furthermore, a comparative analysis demonstrates superior segmentation quality for histopathological grades 1, 2, 3, and 4 using the U-Net approach, as assessed by Jaccard and Dice metrics. This work underscores the utility of machine-driven features in clinical applications that rely on automated pixel-level segmentation in prostate tissue images.

Title: Multi-stage intermediate fusion for multimodal learning to classify non-small cell lung cancer subtypes from CT and PET
Authors: Fatih Aksu, Fabrizia Gelardi, Arturo Chiti, Paolo Soda
Abstract: Accurate classification of histological subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is essential in the era of precision medicine, yet current invasive techniques are not always feasible and may lead to clinical complications. This study presents a multi-stage intermediate fusion approach to classify NSCLC subtypes from CT and PET images. Our method integrates the two modalities at different stages of feature extraction, using voxel-wise fusion to exploit complementary information across varying abstraction levels while preserving spatial correlations. We compare our method against unimodal approaches using only CT or PET images to demonstrate the benefits of modality fusion, and further benchmark it against early and late fusion techniques to highlight the advantages of intermediate fusion during feature extraction. Additionally, we compare our model with the only existing intermediate fusion method for histological subtype classification using PET/CT images. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms all alternatives across key metrics, with an accuracy and AUC equal to 0.724 and 0.681, respectively. This non-invasive approach has the potential to significantly improve diagnostic accuracy, facilitate more informed treatment decisions, and advance personalized care in lung cancer management.

Title: RIS-Aided Monitoring With Cooperative Jamming: Design and Performance Analysis
Authors: Shuying Lin, Yulong Zou, Zhiyang Li, Eduard E. Bahingayi, Le-Nam Tran
Abstract: We investigate a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided wireless surveillance system. In this system, a monitor not only receives signal from suspicious transmitter via a RIS-enhanced legitimate surveillance (LS) link but also simultaneously takes control of multiple jammers to degrade the quality of received suspicious signal. Under this setup, to enhance monitoring performance requires improvements of both the received signal quality at the monitor and the cooperative jamming (CJ). Considering that the surveillance system is aided by one RIS, whose phase shift optimization involves both channel state information (CSI) of the LS and CJ links, we utilize partial CSI to alleviate the CSI acquisition burden in our design. We propose two RIS-aided monitoring schemes with optimal jammer selection (OJS), and derive their closed-form expressions of surveillance success probability (SSP), respectively. Furthermore, we consider RIS-aided monitoring schemes with random jammer selection as corresponding benchmarks. Thereafter, we analyze special cases where the jammers are using power control to avoid being found, making it appears like passive monitoring. Also, the effect of RIS is highlighted by considering asymptotically large number of RIS elements. Numerical results verify that the proposed OJS strategy further enhances the RIS-aided monitoring performance compared with non-jammer-selection RISLR and RISCR schemes, where the superiority comes at the cost of CSI knowledge and becomes marginal in the region of high jamming power. In addition, the RISLO shows surveillance performance advantage overRISCOwhen the suspicious power is low or when the number of RIS elements is large.

Title: Slot-BERT: Self-supervised Object Discovery in Surgical Video
Authors: Guiqiu Liao, Matjaz Jogan, Marcel Hussing, Kenta Nakahashi, Kazuhiro Yasufuku, Amin Madani, Eric Eaton, Daniel A. Hashimoto
Abstract: Object-centric slot attention is a powerful framework for unsupervised learning of structured and explainable representations that can support reasoning about objects and actions, including in surgical videos. While conventional object-centric methods for videos leverage recurrent processing to achieve efficiency, they often struggle with maintaining long-range temporal coherence required for long videos in surgical applications. On the other hand, fully parallel processing of entire videos enhances temporal consistency but introduces significant computational overhead, making it impractical for implementation on hardware in medical facilities. We present Slot-BERT, a bidirectional long-range model that learns object-centric representations in a latent space while ensuring robust temporal coherence. Slot-BERT scales object discovery seamlessly to long videos of unconstrained lengths. A novel slot contrastive loss further reduces redundancy and improves the representation disentanglement by enhancing slot orthogonality. We evaluate Slot-BERT on real-world surgical video datasets from abdominal, cholecystectomy, and thoracic procedures. Our method surpasses state-of-the-art object-centric approaches under unsupervised training achieving superior performance across diverse domains. We also demonstrate efficient zero-shot domain adaptation to data from diverse surgical specialties and databases.

Title: Bidirectional Brain Image Translation using Transfer Learning from Generic Pre-trained Models
Authors: Fatima Haimour, Rizik Al-Sayyed, Waleed Mahafza, Omar S. Al-Kadi
Abstract: Brain imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and treatment of various neurological disorders, providing valuable insights into the structure and function of the brain. Techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) enable non-invasive visualization of the brain, aiding in the understanding of brain anatomy, abnormalities, and functional connectivity. However, cost and radiation dose may limit the acquisition of specific image modalities, so medical image synthesis can be used to generate required medical images without actual addition. In the medical domain, where obtaining labeled medical images is labor-intensive and expensive, addressing data scarcity is a major challenge. Recent studies propose using transfer learning to overcome this issue. This involves adapting pre-trained CycleGAN models, initially trained on non-medical data, to generate realistic medical images. In this work, transfer learning was applied to the task of MR-CT image translation and vice versa using 18 pre-trained non-medical models, and the models were fine-tuned to have the best result. The models' performance was evaluated using four widely used image quality metrics: Peak-signal-to-noise-ratio, Structural Similarity Index, Universal Quality Index, and Visual Information Fidelity. Quantitative evaluation and qualitative perceptual analysis by radiologists demonstrate the potential of transfer learning in medical imaging and the effectiveness of the generic pre-trained model. The results provide compelling evidence of the model's exceptional performance, which can be attributed to the high quality and similarity of the training images to actual human brain images. These results underscore the significance of carefully selecting appropriate and representative training images to optimize performance in brain image analysis tasks.

Title: A Domain Adaptation Framework for Speech Recognition Systems with Only Synthetic data
Authors: Minh Tran, Yutong Pang, Debjyoti Paul, Laxmi Pandey, Kevin Jiang, Jinxi Guo, Ke Li, Shun Zhang, Xuedong Zhang, Xin Lei
Abstract: We introduce DAS (Domain Adaptation with Synthetic data), a novel domain adaptation framework for pre-trained ASR model, designed to efficiently adapt to various language-defined domains without requiring any real data. In particular, DAS first prompts large language models (LLMs) to generate domain-specific texts before converting these texts to speech via text-to-speech technology. The synthetic data is used to fine-tune Whisper with Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) for targeted domains such as music, weather, and sports. We introduce a novel one-pass decoding strategy that merges predictions from multiple LoRA adapters efficiently during the auto-regressive text generation process. Experimental results show significant improvements, reducing the Word Error Rate (WER) by 10% to 17% across all target domains compared to the original model, with minimal performance regression in out-of-domain settings (e.g., -1% on Librispeech test sets). We also demonstrate that DAS operates efficiently during inference, introducing an additional 9% increase in Real Time Factor (RTF) compared to the original model when inferring with three LoRA adapters.

Title: Efficient Lung Ultrasound Severity Scoring Using Dedicated Feature Extractor
Authors: Jiaqi Guo, Yunnan Wu, Evangelos Kaimakamis, Georgios Petmezas, Vasileios E. Papageorgiou, Nicos Maglaveras, Aggelos K. Katsaggelos
Abstract: With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, ultrasound imaging has emerged as a promising technique for COVID-19 detection, due to its non-invasive nature, affordability, and portability. In response, researchers have focused on developing AI-based scoring systems to provide real-time diagnostic support. However, the limited size and lack of proper annotation in publicly available ultrasound datasets pose significant challenges for training a robust AI model. This paper proposes MeDiVLAD, a novel pipeline to address the above issue for multi-level lung-ultrasound (LUS) severity scoring. In particular, we leverage self-knowledge distillation to pretrain a vision transformer (ViT) without label and aggregate frame-level features via dual-level VLAD aggregation. We show that with minimal finetuning, MeDiVLAD outperforms conventional fully-supervised methods in both frame- and video-level scoring, while offering classification reasoning with exceptional quality. This superior performance enables key applications such as the automatic identification of critical lung pathology areas and provides a robust solution for broader medical video classification tasks.

Title: Introducing Resilience to IRS-Assisted Secure Wireless Systems
Authors: Yifei Wu, Mehmet Emin Arslan, Niels Neumann, Wolfgang Gerstacker, Robert Schober
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) are envisioned as a transformative method for enhancing the physical layer security of future communication networks. However, current IRS-assisted secure wireless system designs incur high time cost for the joint optimization of beamforming vectors and IRS phase shifts and are susceptible to unforeseen disruption. Therefore, introducing resilience in IRS-assisted secure systems is essential. In this paper, we first quantify the resilience performance as the combination of the absorption and adaptation performance. In particular, the absorption performance measures the system's robustness when facing failure while the adaptation performance reflects the system's ability to recover from failure. Then, we propose a two-timescale transmission protocol aiming to enhance system resilience while limiting maximum information leakage to eavesdroppers. Specifically, in the initialization phase, the base station (BS) beamforming vectors and IRS phase shifts are optimized iteratively using an alternating optimization (AO) approach to improve the absorption performance of the system, i.e., the worst-case achievable rate, given a predefined maximum tolerable leakage rate, by accounting for the impact of long-term channel variations. When the system detects an outage, a fast system recovery mechanism is activated to restore operation by adjusting only the BS beamforming vectors, which enhances the adaptation performance of the system. Our numerical results reveal that the proposed algorithm significantly improves system resilience, including system robustness and recovery performance. Moreover, the proposed design guarantees outage-free transmission over a long time interval for moderate-size IRSs.

Title: Image Motion Blur Removal in the Temporal Dimension with Video Diffusion Models
Authors: Wang Pang, Zhihao Zhan, Xiang Zhu, Yechao Bai
Abstract: Most motion deblurring algorithms rely on spatial-domain convolution models, which struggle with the complex, non-linear blur arising from camera shake and object motion. In contrast, we propose a novel single-image deblurring approach that treats motion blur as a temporal averaging phenomenon. Our core innovation lies in leveraging a pre-trained video diffusion transformer model to capture diverse motion dynamics within a latent space. It sidesteps explicit kernel estimation and effectively accommodates diverse motion patterns. We implement the algorithm within a diffusion-based inverse problem framework. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques in deblurring complex motion blur scenarios. This work paves the way for utilizing powerful video diffusion models to address single-image deblurring challenges.

Title: The Intrinsic State Variable in Fundamental Lemma and Its Use in Stability Design for Data-based Control
Authors: Yitao Yan, Jie Bao, Biao Huang
Abstract: In the data-based setting, analysis and control design of dynamical systems using measured data are typically based on overlapping trajectory segments of the input and output variables. This could lead to complex designs because the system internal dynamics, which is typically reflected by the system state variable, is unavailable. In this paper, we will show that the coefficient vector in a modified version of Willems' fundamental lemma is an intrinsic and observable state variable for the system behavior. This argument evolves from the behavioral framework without the requirement of prior knowledge on the causality among system variables or any predefined representation structure (e.g., a state space representation). Such a view allows for the construction of a state map based on the fundamental lemma, bridging the trajectory space and the state space. The state property of the coefficient vector allows for a simple stability design approach using memoryless quadratic functions of it as Lyapunov functions, from which the control action for each step can be explicitly constructed. Using the coefficient vector as a state variable could see wide applications in the analysis and control design of dynamical systems including directions beyond the discussions in this paper.

Title: EmoTech: A Multi-modal Speech Emotion Recognition Using Multi-source Low-level Information with Hybrid Recurrent Network
Authors: Shamin Bin Habib Avro, Taieba Taher, Nursadul Mamun
Abstract: Emotion recognition is a critical task in human-computer interaction, enabling more intuitive and responsive systems. This study presents a multimodal emotion recognition system that combines low-level information from audio and text, leveraging both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (BiLSTMs). The proposed system consists of two parallel networks: an Audio Block and a Text Block. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) are extracted and processed by a BiLSTM network and a 2D convolutional network to capture low-level intrinsic and extrinsic features from speech. Simultaneously, a combined BiLSTM-CNN network extracts the low-level sequential nature of text from word embeddings corresponding to the available audio. This low-level information from speech and text is then concatenated and processed by several fully connected layers to classify the speech emotion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed EmoTech accurately recognizes emotions from combined audio and text inputs, achieving an overall accuracy of 84%. This solution outperforms previously proposed approaches for the same dataset and modalities.

Title: EmoFormer: A Text-Independent Speech Emotion Recognition using a Hybrid Transformer-CNN model
Authors: Rashedul Hasan, Meher Nigar, Nursadul Mamun, Sayan Paul
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition is a crucial area of research in human-computer interaction. While significant work has been done in this field, many state-of-the-art networks struggle to accurately recognize emotions in speech when the data is both speech and speaker-independent. To address this limitation, this study proposes, EmoFormer, a hybrid model combining CNNs (CNNs) with Transformer encoders to capture emotion patterns in speech data for such independent datasets. The EmoFormer network was trained and tested using the Expressive Anechoic Recordings of Speech (EARS) dataset, recently released by META. We experimented with two feature extraction techniques: MFCCs and x-vectors. The model was evaluated on different emotion sets comprising 5, 7, 10, and 23 distinct categories. The results demonstrate that the model achieved its best performance with five emotions, attaining an accuracy of 90%, a precision of 0.92, a recall, and an F1-score of 0.91. However, performance decreased as the number of emotions increased, with an accuracy of 83% for seven emotions compared to 70% for the baseline network. This study highlights the effectiveness of combining CNNs and Transformer-based architectures for emotion recognition from speech, particularly when using MFCC features.

Title: Hardware-in-the-Loop Evaluation of Goodness of Fit (GoF) Testing for Dynamic Spectrum Sharing
Authors: Mir Lodro, Simon Armour, Mark A. Beach
Abstract: In contrast to parametric spectrum sensing, non-parametric spectrum sensing can effectively detect the primary user's presence or absence without prior information about the primary user. Particularly, non-parametric spectrum sensing can be useful in dynamic spectrum sharing. The secondary user must detect incumbents and peer secondary users in dynamic spectrum sharing. The secondary user can use the licensed spectrum if the primary user is not detected using its band. The primary user detection problem is the goodness-of-fit testing problem. In this work, we performed a hardware-in-the-loop evaluation of goodness-of-fit tests such as Cramer-von-Mises (CM), Anderson-Darling (AD) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests. We used a wideband radio transceiver RFSoC 4x2 from AMD and an F8 radio channel emulator to perform GoF tests.

Title: SoundSpring: Loss-Resilient Audio Transceiver with Dual-Functional Masked Language Modeling
Authors: Shengshi Yao, Jincheng Dai, Xiaoqi Qin, Sixian Wang, Siye Wang, Kai Niu, Ping Zhang
Abstract: In this paper, we propose "SoundSpring", a cutting-edge error-resilient audio transceiver that marries the robustness benefits of joint source-channel coding (JSCC) while also being compatible with current digital communication systems. Unlike recent deep JSCC transceivers, which learn to directly map audio signals to analog channel-input symbols via neural networks, our SoundSpring adopts the layered architecture that delineates audio compression from digital coded transmission, but it sufficiently exploits the impressive in-context predictive capabilities of large language (foundation) models. Integrated with the casual-order mask learning strategy, our single model operates on the latent feature domain and serve dual-functionalities: as efficient audio compressors at the transmitter and as effective mechanisms for packet loss concealment at the receiver. By jointly optimizing towards both audio compression efficiency and transmission error resiliency, we show that mask-learned language models are indeed powerful contextual predictors, and our dual-functional compression and concealment framework offers fresh perspectives on the application of foundation language models in audio communication. Through extensive experimental evaluations, we establish that SoundSpring apparently outperforms contemporary audio transmission systems in terms of signal fidelity metrics and perceptual quality scores. These new findings not only advocate for the practical deployment of SoundSpring in learning-based audio communication systems but also inspire the development of future audio semantic transceivers.

Title: The Marginal Importance of Distortions and Alignment in CASSI systems
Authors: Léo Paillet (LAAS-PHOTO, LAAS-RIS, IRAP), Antoine Rouxel (LAAS-PHOTO), Hervé Carfantan (IRAP), Simon Lacroix (LAAS-RIS), Antoine Monmayrant (LAAS-PHOTO)
Abstract: This paper introduces a differentiable ray-tracing based model that incorporates aberrations and distortions to render realistic coded hyperspectral acquisitions using Coded-Aperture Spectral Snapshot Imagers (CASSI). CASSI systems can now be optimized in order to fulfill simultaneously several optical design constraints as well as processing constraints. Four comparable CASSI systems with varying degree of optical aberrations have been designed and modeled. The resulting rendered hyperspectral acquisitions from each of these systems are combined with five state-of-the-art hyperspectral cube reconstruction processes. These reconstruction processes encompass a mapping function created from each system's propagation model to account for distortions and aberrations during the reconstruction process. Our analyses show that if properly modeled, the effects of geometric distortions of the system and misalignments of the dispersive elements have a marginal impact on the overall quality of the reconstructed hyperspectral data cubes. Therefore, relaxing traditional constraints on measurement conformity and fidelity to the scene enables the development of novel imaging instruments, guided by performance metrics applied to the design or the processing of acquisitions. By providing a complete framework for design, simulation and evaluation, this work contributes to the optimization and exploration of new CASSI systems, and more generally to the computational imaging community.

Title: Urban Priority Pass: Fair Signalized Intersection Management Accounting For Passenger Needs Through Prioritization
Authors: Kevin Riehl, Anastasios Kouvelas, Michail Makridis
Abstract: Over the past few decades, efforts of road traffic management and practice have predominantly focused on maximizing system efficiency and mitigating congestion from a system perspective. This efficiency-driven approach implies the equal treatment of all vehicles, which often overlooks individual user experiences, broader social impacts, and the fact that users are heterogeneous in their urgency and experience different costs when being delayed. Existing strategies to account for the differences in needs of users in traffic management cover dedicated transit lanes, prioritization of emergency vehicles, transit signal prioritization, and economic instruments. Even though they are the major bottleneck for traffic in cities, no dedicated instrument that enables prioritization of individual drivers at intersections. The Priority Pass is a reservation-based, economic controller that expedites entitled vehicles at signalized intersections, without causing arbitrary delays for not-entitled vehicles and without affecting transportation efficiency de trop. The prioritization of vulnerable road users, emergency vehicles, commercial taxi and delivery drivers, or urgent individuals can enhance road safety, and achieve social, environmental, and economic goals. A case study in Manhattan demonstrates the feasibility of individual prioritization (up to 40\% delay decrease), and quantifies the potential of the Priority Pass to gain social welfare benefits for the people. A market for prioritization could generate up to 1 million \$ in daily revenues for Manhattan, and equitably allocate delay reductions to those in need, rather than those with a high income.

Title: Orbit-Attitude Predictive Control in the Vicinity of Asteroids with In Situ Gravity Estimation
Authors: Julio C. Sanchez, Rafael Vazquez, James D. Biggs, Franco Bernelli-Zazzera
Abstract: This paper presents an integrated model-learning predictive control scheme for spacecraft orbit-attitude station-keeping in the vicinity of asteroids. The orbiting probe relies on optical and laser navigation while attitude measurements are provided by star trackers and gyroscopes. The asteroid gravity field inhomogeneities are assumed to be unknown a priori. The state and gravity model parameters are estimated simultaneously using an unscented Kalman filter. The proposed gravity model identification enables the application of a learning-based predictive control methodology. The predictive control allows for a high degree of accuracy because the predicted model is progressively identified in situ. Consequently, the tracking errors decrease over time as the model accuracy increases. Finally, a constellation mission concept is analyzed in order to speed up the model identification process. Numerical results are shown and discussed.

Title: FDG-Diff: Frequency-Domain-Guided Diffusion Framework for Compressed Hazy Image Restoration
Authors: Ruicheng Zhang, Kanghui Tian, Zeyu Zhang, Qixiang Liu, Zhi Jin
Abstract: In this study, we reveal that the interaction between haze degradation and JPEG compression introduces complex joint loss effects, which significantly complicate image restoration. Existing dehazing models often neglect compression effects, which limits their effectiveness in practical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce three key contributions. First, we design FDG-Diff, a novel frequency-domain-guided dehazing framework that improves JPEG image restoration by leveraging frequency-domain information. Second, we introduce the High-Frequency Compensation Module (HFCM), which enhances spatial-domain detail restoration by incorporating frequency-domain augmentation techniques into a diffusion-based restoration framework. Lastly, the introduction of the Degradation-Aware Denoising Timestep Predictor (DADTP) module further enhances restoration quality by enabling adaptive region-specific restoration, effectively addressing regional degradation inconsistencies in compressed hazy images. Experimental results across multiple compressed dehazing datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the latest state-of-the-art approaches. Code be available at this https URL.

Title: A coupled FE-BE multi-scale method for the dynamics of jointed structures
Authors: Hendrik D. Linder, Johann Gross, Malte Krack
Abstract: The damping of built-up structures stems largely from the microscopic dry frictional interactions in the contact interfaces. The accurate prediction of friction damping has been an important scientific aim of the past several decades. Recent research indicates that very good agreement with vibration measurements is to be expected if the actual contact surface topography is sufficiently well known and finely resolved, and frictional-unilateral interactions are modeled in terms of the Coulomb-Signorini conditions. Resolving all relevant length scales in one finite element model leads to enormous or even prohibitive computation effort and regularization of the set-valued contact laws might be needed to ensure numerical stability. In this work, we propose a multi-scale approach: The stress and deformation field in the contact region is modeled using elastic half-space theory, implemented on a regular and fine grid of boundary elements (BE), so that the compliance matrix can be expressed in closed form. The vibration behavior of the remaining region is described using a relatively coarse finite element (FE) model, which is further reduced via component mode synthesis. The two models are coupled by enforcing compatibility and equilibrium conditions in the far field. The set-valued Coulomb-Signorini conditions are enforced robustly and efficiently using a projected over-relaxation scheme in conjunction with an appropriate active-set strategy. For the S4 beam benchmark, very good agreement with regard to the amplitude-dependent frequency and damping ratio of the first few modes is achieved, while the computation effort is reduced by several orders of magnitude compared to the full-FE reference. The proposed multi-scale method permits a very fine resolution of the contact surface topography without suffering from numerical instability.

Title: Hardware Distortion Modeling for Panel Selection in Large Intelligent Surfaces
Authors: Ashkan Sheikhi, Juan Vidal Alegría, Ove Edfors
Abstract: Hardware distortion in large intelligent surfaces (LISs) may limit their performance when scaling up such systems. It is of great importance to model the non-ideal effects in their transceivers to study the hardware distortions that can affect their performance. Therefore, we have focused on modeling and studying the effects of nonlinear RX-chains in LISs. We first derive expressions for SNDR of a LIS with a memory-less polynomial-based model at its RX-chains. Then we propose a simplified double-parameter exponential model for the distortion power and show that compared to the polynomial based model, the exponential model can improve the analytical tractability for SNDR optimization problems. In particular, we consider a panel selection optimization problems in a panel-based LIS scenario and show that the proposed model enables us to derive two closed-form sub-optimal solutions for panel selection, and can be a favorable alternative to high-order polynomial models in terms of computation complexity, especially for theoretical works on hardware distortion in MIMO and LIS systems. Numerical results show that the sub-optimal closed-form solutions have a near-optimal performance in terms of SNDR compared to the global optimum found by high-complexity heuristic search methods.

Title: Closed-loop robust control of long-term diabetes progression via physical activity management
Authors: Pierluigi Francesco De Paola, Alessandro Borri, Fabrizio Dabbene, Pasquale Palumbo, Alessia Paglialonga
Abstract: Large clinical evidence acknowledges the crucial role played by physical activity in delaying the progression of type-2 diabetes. However, the literature lacks control approaches that leverage exercise for type-2 diabetes control and more in general lacks a quantitative assessment of medical guidelines on the recommended amount of physical activity to be performed, mainly due to the absence of mathematical models that suitably estimate its benefits on diabetes progression. In this work, in order to provide a control-theoretical formulation of the exercise, we design a feedback law in terms of recommended physical activity, following a model predictive control approach, based on a widespread compact diabetes progression model, suitably modified to properly account for the long-term effect of the exercise. Moreover we illustrate how the proposed approach proves to show reliable robustness properties with respect to initial conditions and parameter perturbations, which may be used to reflect inter-patient variability. Results are encouraging in view of the validation of the control law on comprehensive high-dimensional models of diabetes progression, with the aim of translating the prediction of the controller into reasonable recommendations and to quantitatively support medical decision-making.

Title: Learning to Optimize Joint Chance-constrained Power Dispatch Problems
Authors: Meiyi Li, Javad Mohammadi
Abstract: The ever-increasing integration of stochastic renewable energy sources into power systems operation is making the supply-demand balance more challenging. While joint chance-constrained methods are equipped to model these complexities and uncertainties, solving these models using the traditional iterative solvers is time-consuming and can hinder real-time implementation. To overcome the shortcomings of today's solvers, we propose a fast, scalable, and explainable machine learning-based optimization proxy. Our solution, called Learning to Optimize the Optimization of Joint Chance-Constrained Problems (LOOP-JCCP), is iteration-free and solves the underlying problem in a single-shot. Our model uses a polyhedral reformulation of the original problem to manage constraint violations and ensure solution feasibility across various scenarios through customizable probability settings. To this end, we build on our recent deterministic solution (LOOP-LC 2.0) by incorporating a set aggregator module to handle uncertain sample sets of varying sizes and complexities. Our results verify the feasibility of our near-optimal solutions for joint chance-constrained power dispatch scenarios. Additionally, our feasibility guarantees increase the transparency and interpretability of our method, which is essential for operators to trust the outcomes. We showcase the effectiveness of our model in solving the stochastic energy management problem of Virtual Power Plants (VPPs). Our numerical findings complement our theoretical justifications and demonstrate great flexibility in parameter tuning, adaptability to diverse datasets, and increased computational speed.

Title: Set-point control and local stability for flat nonlinear systems using model-following control
Authors: Julian Willkomm, Kai Wulff, Johann Reger
Abstract: We consider the set-point control problem for nonlinear systems with flat output that are subject to perturbations. The nonlinear dynamics as well as the perturbations are locally Lipschitz. We apply the model-following control (MFC) approach which consists of a model control loop (MCL) for a feedforward generation and a process control loop (PCL) that compensates the perturbations using high-gain feedback. We analyse the resulting closed-loop system and discuss its relation to a standard flatness-based high-gain approach. In particular we analyse the estimated region of attraction provided by a quadratic Lyapunov function. A case study illustrates the approach and quantifies the region of attraction obtained for each control approach. Using the initial condition of the model control loop as tuning parameter for the MFC design, provides that a significantly larger region of attraction can be guaranteed compared to a conventional single-loop high-gain design.

Title: A control system framework for counterfactuals: an optimization based approach
Authors: Pierluigi Francesco De Paola, Jared Miller, Alessandro Borri, Alessia Paglialonga, Fabrizio Dabbene
Abstract: Counterfactuals are a concept inherited from the field of logic and in general attain to the existence of causal relations between sentences or events. In particular, this concept has been introduced also in the context of interpretability in artificial intelligence, where counterfactuals refer to the minimum change to the feature values that changes the prediction of a classification model. The artificial intelligence framework of counterfactuals is mostly focused on machine learning approaches, typically neglecting the physics of the variables that determine a change in class. However, a theoretical formulation of counterfactuals in a control system framework - i.e., able to account for the mechanisms underlying a change in class - is lacking. To fill this gap, in this work we propose an original control system, physics-informed, theoretical foundation for counterfactuals, by means of the formulation of an optimal control problem. We apply the proposed methodology to a general glucose-insulin regulation model and results appear promising and pave the way to the possible integration with artificial intelligence techniques, with the aim of feeding machine learning models with the physics knowledge acquired through the system framework.

Title: Trajectory tracking model-following control using Lyapunov redesign with output time-derivatives to compensate unmatched uncertainties
Authors: Niclas Tietze, Kai Wulff, Johann Reger
Abstract: We study trajectory tracking for flat nonlinear systems with unmatched uncertainties using the model-following control (MFC) architecture. We apply state feedback linearisation control for the process and propose a simplified implementation of the model control loop which results in a simple model in Brunovsky-form that represents the nominal feedback linearised dynamics of the nonlinear process. To compensate possibly unmatched model uncertainties, we employ Lyapunov redesign with numeric derivatives of the output. It turns out that for a special initialisation of the model, the MFC reduces to a single-loop control design. We illustrate our results by a numerical example.

Title: Lipschitz Safe Bayesian Optimization for Automotive Control
Authors: Johanna Menn, Pietro Pelizzari, Michael Fleps-Dezasse, Sebastian Trimpe
Abstract: Controller tuning is a labor-intensive process that requires human intervention and expert knowledge. Bayesian optimization has been applied successfully in different fields to automate this process. However, when tuning on hardware, such as in automotive applications, strict safety requirements often arise. To obtain safety guarantees, many existing safe Bayesian optimization methods rely on assumptions that are hard to verify in practice. This leads to the use of unjustified heuristics in many applications, which invalidates the theoretical safety guarantees. Furthermore, applications often require multiple safety constraints to be satisfied simultaneously. Building on recently proposed Lipschitz-only safe Bayesian optimization, we develop an algorithm that relies on readily interpretable assumptions and satisfies multiple safety constraints at the same time. We apply this algorithm to the problem of automatically tuning a trajectory-tracking controller of a self-driving car. Results both from simulations and an actual test vehicle underline the algorithm's ability to learn tracking controllers without leaving the track or violating any other safety constraints.

Title: LLM4WM: Adapting LLM for Wireless Multi-Tasking
Authors: Xuanyu Liu, Shijian Gao, Boxun Liu, Xiang Cheng, Liuqing Yang
Abstract: The wireless channel is fundamental to communication, encompassing numerous tasks collectively referred to as channel-associated tasks. These tasks can leverage joint learning based on channel characteristics to share representations and enhance system design. To capitalize on this advantage, LLM4WM is proposed--a large language model (LLM) multi-task fine-tuning framework specifically tailored for channel-associated tasks. This framework utilizes a Mixture of Experts with Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE-LoRA) approach for multi-task fine-tuning, enabling the transfer of the pre-trained LLM's general knowledge to these tasks. Given the unique characteristics of wireless channel data, preprocessing modules, adapter modules, and multi-task output layers are designed to align the channel data with the LLM's semantic feature space. Experiments on a channel-associated multi-task dataset demonstrate that LLM4WM outperforms existing methodologies in both full-sample and few-shot evaluations, owing to its robust multi-task joint modeling and transfer learning capabilities.

Abstract: The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in understanding and generating various data types, such as images and text, has demonstrated their ability to process and extract semantic information across diverse domains. This transformative capability lays the foundation for semantic communications, enabling highly efficient and intelligent communication systems. In this work, we present a novel OFDM-based semantic communication framework for image transmission. We propose an innovative semantic encoder design that leverages the ability of LLMs to extract the meaning of transmitted data rather than focusing on its raw representation. On the receiver side, we design an LLM-based semantic decoder capable of comprehending context and generating the most appropriate representation to fit the given context. We evaluate our proposed system under different scenarios, including Urban Macro-cell environments with varying speed ranges. The evaluation metrics demonstrate that our proposed system reduces the data size 4250 times, while achieving a higher data rate compared to conventional communication methods. This approach offers a robust and scalable solution to unlock the full potential of 6G connectivity.

Authors: Hossein Nejatbakhsh Esfahani, Kai Liu, Javad Mohammadpour Velni
Abstract: This paper presents a fusion of Multi-agent Bayesian Optimization (MABO) and Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC) aiming at learning the DMPC schemes with imperfect local models in a distributed manner. In the proposed method, we use a dual-decomposition method for a DMPC and leverage an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based MABO for coordinated learning of the parameterized DMPC scheme to improve the closed-loop performance of the local MPC schemes even if their models cannot capture the real multi-agent system perfectly.

Title: European Energy Vision 2060: Charting Diverse Pathways for Europe's Energy Transition

Abstract: Europe is warming at the fastest rate of all continents, experiencing a temperature increase of about 1°C higher than the corresponding global increase. Aiming to be the first climate-neutral continent by 2050 under the European Green Deal, Europe requires an in-depth understanding of the potential energy transition pathways. In this paper, we develop four qualitative long-term scenarios covering the European energy landscape, considering key uncertainty pillars -- categorized under social, technological, economic, political, and geopolitical aspects. First, we place the scenarios in a three-dimensional space defined by Social dynamics, Innovation, and Geopolitical instabilities. These scenarios are brought to life by defining their narratives and focus areas according to their location in this three-dimensional space. The scenarios envision diverse futures and include distinct features. The EU Trinity scenario pictures how internal divisions among EU member states, in the context of global geopolitical instability, affect the EU climate targets. The REPowerEU++ scenario outlines the steps needed for a self-sufficient, independent European energy system by 2050. The Go RES scenario examines the feasibility of achieving carbon neutrality earlier than 2050 given favourable uncertain factors. The NECP Essentials scenario extends current national energy and climate plans until 2060 to assess their role in realizing climate neutrality. The scenarios are extended by incorporating policies and economic factors and detailed in a Qualitative to Quantitative (Q2Q) matrix, linking narratives to quantification. Finally, two scenarios are quantified to illustrate the quantification process. All the scenarios are in the process of being quantified and will be openly available and reusable.

Title: Why disentanglement-based speaker anonymization systems fail at preserving emotions?
Authors: Ünal Ege Gaznepoglu, Nils Peters
Abstract: Disentanglement-based speaker anonymization involves decomposing speech into a semantically meaningful representation, altering the speaker embedding, and resynthesizing a waveform using a neural vocoder. State-of-the-art systems of this kind are known to remove emotion information. Possible reasons include mode collapse in GAN-based vocoders, unintended modeling and modification of emotions through speaker embeddings, or excessive sanitization of the intermediate representation. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of a state-of-the-art speaker anonymization system to understand the underlying causes. We conclude that the main reason is the lack of emotion-related information in the intermediate representation. The speaker embeddings also have a high impact, if they are learned in a generative context. The vocoder's out-of-distribution performance has a smaller impact. Additionally, we discovered that synthesis artifacts increase spectral kurtosis, biasing emotion recognition evaluation towards classifying utterances as angry. Therefore, we conclude that reporting unweighted average recall alone for emotion recognition performance is suboptimal.

Title: Communication-Efficient Distributed Kalman Filtering using ADMM
Authors: Muhammad Iqbal, Kundan Kumar, Simo Särkkä
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of optimal linear filtering in a network of local estimators, commonly referred to as distributed Kalman filtering (DKF). The DKF problem is formulated within a distributed optimization framework, where coupling constraints require the exchange of local state and covariance updates between neighboring nodes to achieve consensus. To address these constraints, the problem is transformed into an unconstrained optimization form using the augmented Lagrangian method. The distributed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is then applied to derive update steps that achieve the desired performance while exchanging only the primal variables. Notably, the proposed method enhances communication efficiency by eliminating the need for dual variable exchange. We show that the design parameters depend on the maximum eigenvalue of the network's Laplacian matrix, yielding a significantly tighter bound compared to existing results. A rigorous convergence analysis is provided, proving that the state estimates converge to the true state and that the covariance matrices across all local estimators converge to a globally optimal solution. Numerical results are presented to validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

Title: Terahertz Integrated Sensing Communications and Powering for 6G Wireless Networks
Authors: Hua Yan, Yunfei Chen
Abstract: The terahertz (THz) band has attracted significant interest for future wireless networks. In this paper, a THz integrated sensing communications and powering (THz-ISCAP) system, where sensing is leveraged to enhance communications and powering, is studied. For a given total amount of time, we aim to determine an optimal time allocation for sensing to improve the efficiency of communications and powering, along with an optimal power splitting ratio to balance these two functionalities. This is achieved by maximizing between communications and powering either the achievable rate or harvested energy while ensuring a minimum requirement on the other. Numerical results indicate that the optimal system performance can be achieved by jointly optimizing the sensing time allocation and the power splitting ratio. Additionally, the results reveal the effects of various factors, such as THz frequencies and antenna aperture sizes, on the system performance. This study provides some interesting results to offer a new perspective for the research on THz-ISCAP.

Title: Learning accurate rigid registration for longitudinal brain MRI from synthetic data
Authors: Jingru Fu, Adrian V. Dalca, Bruce Fischl, Rodrigo Moreno, Malte Hoffmann
Abstract: Rigid registration aims to determine the translations and rotations necessary to align features in a pair of images. While recent machine learning methods have become state-of-the-art for linear and deformable registration across subjects, they have demonstrated limitations when applied to longitudinal (within-subject) registration, where achieving precise alignment is critical. Building on an existing framework for anatomy-aware, acquisition-agnostic affine registration, we propose a model optimized for longitudinal, rigid brain registration. By training the model with synthetic within-subject pairs augmented with rigid and subtle nonlinear transforms, the model estimates more accurate rigid transforms than previous cross-subject networks and performs robustly on longitudinal registration pairs within and across magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrasts.

Title: Retrieval-Augmented Neural Field for HRTF Upsampling and Personalization
Authors: Yoshiki Masuyama, Gordon Wichern, François G. Germain, Christopher Ick, Jonathan Le Roux
Abstract: Head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) with dense spatial grids are desired for immersive binaural audio generation, but their recording is time-consuming. Although HRTF spatial upsampling has shown remarkable progress with neural fields, spatial upsampling only from a few measured directions, e.g., 3 or 5 measurements, is still challenging. To tackle this problem, we propose a retrieval-augmented neural field (RANF). RANF retrieves a subject whose HRTFs are close to those of the target subject from a dataset. The HRTF of the retrieved subject at the desired direction is fed into the neural field in addition to the sound source direction itself. Furthermore, we present a neural network that can efficiently handle multiple retrieved subjects, inspired by a multi-channel processing technique called transform-average-concatenate. Our experiments confirm the benefits of RANF on the SONICOM dataset, and it is a key component in the winning solution of Task 2 of the listener acoustic personalization challenge 2024.

Title: Control-ITRA: Controlling the Behavior of a Driving Model
Authors: Vasileios Lioutas, Adam Scibior, Matthew Niedoba, Berend Zwartsenberg, Frank Wood
Abstract: Simulating realistic driving behavior is crucial for developing and testing autonomous systems in complex traffic environments. Equally important is the ability to control the behavior of simulated agents to tailor scenarios to specific research needs and safety considerations. This paper extends the general-purpose multi-agent driving behavior model ITRA (Scibior et al., 2021), by introducing a method called Control-ITRA to influence agent behavior through waypoint assignment and target speed modulation. By conditioning agents on these two aspects, we provide a mechanism for them to adhere to specific trajectories and indirectly adjust their aggressiveness. We compare different approaches for integrating these conditions during training and demonstrate that our method can generate controllable, infraction-free trajectories while preserving realism in both seen and unseen locations.

Title: Egoistic MDS-based Rigid Body Localization
Authors: Niclas Führling, Giuseppe Abreu, David González G., Osvaldo Gonsa
Abstract: We consider a novel anchorless rigid body localization (RBL) suitable for application in autonomous driving (AD), in so far as the algorithm enables a rigid body to egoistically detect the location (relative translation) and orientation (relative rotation) of another body, without knowledge of the shape of the latter, based only on a set of measurements of the distances between sensors of one vehicle to the other. A key point of the proposed method is that the translation vector between the two-bodies is modeled using the double-centering operator from multidimensional scaling (MDS) theory, enabling the method to be used between rigid bodies regardless of their shapes, in contrast to conventional approaches which require both bodies to have the same shape. Simulation results illustrate the good performance of the proposed technique in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimates in different setups.

Title: fabSAM: A Farmland Boundary Delineation Method Based on the Segment Anything Model
Authors: Yufeng Xie, Hanzhi Wu, Hongxiang Tong, Lei Xiao, Wenwen Zhou, Ling Li, Thomas Cherico Wanger
Abstract: Delineating farmland boundaries is essential for agricultural management such as crop monitoring and agricultural census. Traditional methods using remote sensing imagery have been efficient but limited in generalisation. The Segment Anything Model (SAM), known for its impressive zero shot performance, has been adapted for remote sensing tasks through prompt learning and fine tuning. Here, we propose a SAM based farmland boundary delineation framework 'fabSAM' that combines a Deeplabv3+ based Prompter and SAM. Also, a fine tuning strategy was introduced to enable SAMs decoder to improve the use of prompt information. Experimental results on the AI4Boundaries and AI4SmallFarms datasets have shown that fabSAM has a significant improvement in farmland region identification and boundary delineation. Compared to zero shot SAM, fabSAM surpassed it by 23.5% and 15.1% in mIOU on the AI4Boundaries and AI4SmallFarms datasets, respectively. For Deeplabv3+, fabSAM outperformed it by 4.9% and 12.5% in mIOU, respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of fabSAM, which also means that we can more easily obtain the global farmland region and boundary maps from open source satellite image datasets like Sentinel2.

Title: Reinforcement Learning Constrained Beam Search for Parameter Optimization of Paper Drying Under Flexible Constraints
Authors: Siyuan Chen, Hanshen Yu, Jamal Yagoobi, Chenhui Shao
Abstract: Existing approaches to enforcing design constraints in Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications often rely on training-time penalties in the reward function or training/inference-time invalid action masking, but these methods either cannot be modified after training, or are limited in the types of constraints that can be implemented. To address this limitation, we propose Reinforcement Learning Constrained Beam Search (RLCBS) for inference-time refinement in combinatorial optimization problems. This method respects flexible, inference-time constraints that support exclusion of invalid actions and forced inclusion of desired actions, and employs beam search to maximize sequence probability for more sensible constraint incorporation. RLCBS is extensible to RL-based planning and optimization problems that do not require real-time solution, and we apply the method to optimize process parameters for a novel modular testbed for paper drying. An RL agent is trained to minimize energy consumption across varying machine speed levels by generating optimal dryer module and air supply temperature configurations. Our results demonstrate that RLCBS outperforms NSGA-II under complex design constraints on drying module configurations at inference-time, while providing a 2.58-fold or higher speed improvement.

Title: Energy Landscape Shaping for Robust Control of Atoms in Optical Lattices
Authors: C. A. Weidner, S. P. O'Neil, E. A. Jonckheere, F. C. Langbein, S. G. Schirmer
Abstract: Robust quantum control is crucial for realizing practical quantum technologies. Energy landscape shaping offers an alternative to conventional dynamic control, providing theoretically enhanced robustness and simplifying implementation for certain applications. This work demonstrates the feasibility of robust energy landscape control in a practical implementation with ultracold atoms. We leverage a digital mirror device (DMD) to shape optical potentials, creating complex energy landscapes. To achieve a desired objective, such as efficient quantum state transfer, we formulate a novel hybrid optimization approach that effectively handles both continuous (laser power) and discrete (DMD pixel activation) control parameters. This approach combines constrained quasi-Newton methods with surrogate models for efficient exploration of the vast parameter space. Furthermore, we introduce a framework for analyzing the robustness of the resulting control schemes against experimental uncertainties. By modeling uncertainties as structured perturbations, we systematically assess controller performance and identify robust solutions. We apply these techniques to maximize spin transfer in a chain of trapped atoms, achieving high-fidelity control while maintaining robustness. Our findings provide insights into the experimental viability of controlled spin transfer in cold atom systems. More broadly, the presented optimization and robustness analysis methods apply to a wide range of quantum control problems, offering a toolkit for designing and evaluating robust controllers in complex experimental settings.

Title: Leveraging LLMs to Create a Haptic Devices' Recommendation System
Authors: Yang Liu, Haiwei Dong, Abdulmotaleb El Saddik
Abstract: Haptic technology has seen significant growth, yet a lack of awareness of existing haptic device design knowledge hinders development. This paper addresses these limitations by leveraging advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop a haptic agent, focusing specifically on Grounded Force Feedback (GFF) devices recommendation. Our approach involves automating the creation of a structured haptic device database using information from research papers and product specifications. This database enables the recommendation of relevant GFF devices based on user queries. To ensure precise and contextually relevant recommendations, the system employs a dynamic retrieval method that combines both conditional and semantic searches. Benchmarking against the established UEQ and existing haptic device searching tools, the proposed haptic recommendation agent ranks in the top 10\% across all UEQ categories with mean differences favoring the agent in nearly all subscales, and maintains no significant performance bias across different user groups, showcasing superior usability and user satisfaction.

Title: Entropy Polarization-Based Data Compression Without Frozen Set Construction
Authors: Zichang Ren, Yuping Zhao
Abstract: Classical source polar codes require the construction of frozen sets for given sources. While this scheme offers excellent theoretical performance, it faces challenges in practical data compression systems, including sensitivity to the accuracy and computational complexity of the construction algorithm. In this letter, we explore the feasibility of construction-free polar compression schemes. By optimally selecting output symbols based on the decoder's behavior, the proposed scheme not only enhances flexibility but also achieves significant improvements in compression rates. Several enhancements are introduced to facilitate the practical implementation of the proposed scheme. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance compared to existing polar compression approaches.

Title: BLR-MoE: Boosted Language-Routing Mixture of Experts for Domain-Robust Multilingual E2E ASR
Authors: Guodong Ma, Wenxuan Wang, Lifeng Zhou, Yuting Yang, Yuke Li, Binbin Du
Abstract: Recently, the Mixture of Expert (MoE) architecture, such as LR-MoE, is often used to alleviate the impact of language confusion on the multilingual ASR (MASR) task. However, it still faces language confusion issues, especially in mismatched domain scenarios. In this paper, we decouple language confusion in LR-MoE into confusion in self-attention and router. To alleviate the language confusion in self-attention, based on LR-MoE, we propose to apply attention-MoE architecture for MASR. In our new architecture, MoE is utilized not only on feed-forward network (FFN) but also on self-attention. In addition, to improve the robustness of the LID-based router on language confusion, we propose expert pruning and router augmentation methods. Combining the above, we get the boosted language-routing MoE (BLR-MoE) architecture. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed BLR-MoE in a 10,000-hour MASR dataset.

Title: Current Opinions on Memristor-Accelerated Machine Learning Hardware
Authors: Mingrui Jiang, Yichun Xu, Zefan Li, Can Li
Abstract: The unprecedented advancement of artificial intelligence has placed immense demands on computing hardware, but traditional silicon-based semiconductor technologies are approaching their physical and economic limit, prompting the exploration of novel computing paradigms. Memristor offers a promising solution, enabling in-memory analog computation and massive parallelism, which leads to low latency and power consumption. This manuscript reviews the current status of memristor-based machine learning accelerators, highlighting the milestones achieved in developing prototype chips, that not only accelerate neural networks inference but also tackle other machine learning tasks. More importantly, it discusses our opinion on current key challenges that remain in this field, such as device variation, the need for efficient peripheral circuitry, and systematic co-design and optimization. We also share our perspective on potential future directions, some of which address existing challenges while others explore untouched territories. By addressing these challenges through interdisciplinary efforts spanning device engineering, circuit design, and systems architecture, memristor-based accelerators could significantly advance the capabilities of AI hardware, particularly for edge applications where power efficiency is paramount.

Title: Low-Complexity Channel Estimation for RIS-Assisted Multi-User Wireless Communications
Authors: Qingchao Li, Mohammed El-Hajjar, Ibrahim Hemadeh, Arman Shojaeifard, Lajos Hanzo
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are eminently suitable for improving the reliability of wireless communications by jointly designing the active beamforming at the base station (BS) and the passive beamforming at the RIS. Therefore, the accuracy of channel estimation is crucial for RIS-aided systems. The challenge is that only the cascaded two-hop channel spanning from the user equipments (UEs) to the RIS and spanning from the RIS to the BS can be estimated, due to the lack of active radio frequency (RF) chains at RIS elements, which leads to high pilot overhead. In this paper, we propose a low-overhead linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) channel estimation method by exploiting the spatial correlation of channel links, which strikes a trade-off between the pilot overhead and the channel estimation accuracy. Moreover, we calculate the theoretical normalized mean square error (MSE) for our channel estimation method. Finally, we verify numerically that the proposed LMMSE estimator has lower MSE than the state-of-the-art (SoA) grouping based estimators.

Title: Hybrid Losses for Hierarchical Embedding Learning
Authors: Haokun Tian, Stefan Lattner, Brian McFee, Charalampos Saitis
Abstract: In traditional supervised learning, the cross-entropy loss treats all incorrect predictions equally, ignoring the relevance or proximity of wrong labels to the correct answer. By leveraging a tree hierarchy for fine-grained labels, we investigate hybrid losses, such as generalised triplet and cross-entropy losses, to enforce similarity between labels within a multi-task learning framework. We propose metrics to evaluate the embedding space structure and assess the model's ability to generalise to unseen classes, that is, to infer similar classes for data belonging to unseen categories. Our experiments on OrchideaSOL, a four-level hierarchical instrument sound dataset with nearly 200 detailed categories, demonstrate that the proposed hybrid losses outperform previous works in classification, retrieval, embedding space structure, and generalisation.

Title: The Black Metal Tribometer: high-resolution measurement of normal load-indentation curves and partial slip hysteresis cycles
Authors: Daniel Fochler, Stefan Schwarz, Lukas Kohlmann, Malte Krack
Abstract: A new instrument has been designed for measuring frictional hysteresis cycles and normal load-indentation curves. The primary purpose of the BMT is the validation of more predictive modeling approaches for damping in friction joints. An important original feature of the BMT is its ability to measure both normal and tangential contact behavior without having to separate the samples. Special attention was paid to alignment and smooth motion in order to permit testing nominally flat-on-flat contacts in the microslip regime. Examples are shown for finely resolved, undistorted hysteresis cycles with relative tangential displacement amplitudes in the sub-micrometer range at about 50 MPa nominal normal pressure, which is maintained well over the tangential load cycle.

Title: S-KEY: Self-supervised Learning of Major and Minor Keys from Audio
Authors: Yuexuan Kong, Gabriel Meseguer-Brocal, Vincent Lostanlen, Mathieu Lagrange, Romain Hennequin
Abstract: STONE, the current method in self-supervised learning for tonality estimation in music signals, cannot distinguish relative keys, such as C major versus A minor. In this article, we extend the neural network architecture and learning objective of STONE to perform self-supervised learning of major and minor keys (S-KEY). Our main contribution is an auxiliary pretext task to STONE, formulated using transposition-invariant chroma features as a source of pseudo-labels. S-KEY matches the supervised state of the art in tonality estimation on FMAKv2 and GTZAN datasets while requiring no human annotation and having the same parameter budget as STONE. We build upon this result and expand the training set of S-KEY to a million songs, thus showing the potential of large-scale self-supervised learning in music information retrieval.

Title: FlanEC: Exploring Flan-T5 for Post-ASR Error Correction
Authors: Moreno La Quatra, Valerio Mario Salerno, Yu Tsao, Sabato Marco Siniscalchi
Abstract: In this paper, we present an encoder-decoder model leveraging Flan-T5 for post-Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) Generative Speech Error Correction (GenSEC), and we refer to it as FlanEC. We explore its application within the GenSEC framework to enhance ASR outputs by mapping n-best hypotheses into a single output sentence. By utilizing n-best lists from ASR models, we aim to improve the linguistic correctness, accuracy, and grammaticality of final ASR transcriptions. Specifically, we investigate whether scaling the training data and incorporating diverse datasets can lead to significant improvements in post-ASR error correction. We evaluate FlanEC using the HyPoradise dataset, providing a comprehensive analysis of the model's effectiveness in this domain. Furthermore, we assess the proposed approach under different settings to evaluate model scalability and efficiency, offering valuable insights into the potential of instruction-tuned encoder-decoder models for this task.

Title: Deep Learning-Based Image Recovery and Pose Estimation for Resident Space Objects
Authors: Louis Aberdeen, Mark Hansen, Melvyn L. Smith, Lyndon Smith
Abstract: As the density of spacecraft in Earth's orbit increases, their recognition, pose and trajectory identification becomes crucial for averting potential collisions and executing debris removal operations. However, training models able to identify a spacecraft and its pose presents a significant challenge due to a lack of available image data for model training. This paper puts forth an innovative framework for generating realistic synthetic datasets of Resident Space Object (RSO) imagery. Using the International Space Station (ISS) as a test case, it goes on to combine image regression with image restoration methodologies to estimate pose from blurred images. An analysis of the proposed image recovery and regression techniques was undertaken, providing insights into the performance, potential enhancements and limitations when applied to real imagery of RSOs. The image recovery approach investigated involves first applying image deconvolution using an effective point spread function, followed by detail object extraction with a U-Net. Interestingly, using only U-Net for image reconstruction the best pose performance was attained, reducing the average Mean Squared Error in image recovery by 97.28% and the average angular error by 71.9%. The successful application of U-Net image restoration combined with the Resnet50 regression network for pose estimation of the International Space Station demonstrates the value of a diverse set of evaluation tools for effective solutions to real-world problems such as the analysis of distant objects in Earth's orbit.

Title: Optimizing Return Distributions with Distributional Dynamic Programming
Authors: Bernardo Ávila Pires, Mark Rowland, Diana Borsa, Zhaohan Daniel Guo, Khimya Khetarpal, André Barreto, David Abel, Rémi Munos, Will Dabney
Abstract: We introduce distributional dynamic programming (DP) methods for optimizing statistical functionals of the return distribution, with standard reinforcement learning as a special case. Previous distributional DP methods could optimize the same class of expected utilities as classic DP. To go beyond expected utilities, we combine distributional DP with stock augmentation, a technique previously introduced for classic DP in the context of risk-sensitive RL, where the MDP state is augmented with a statistic of the rewards obtained so far (since the first time step). We find that a number of recently studied problems can be formulated as stock-augmented return distribution optimization, and we show that we can use distributional DP to solve them. We analyze distributional value and policy iteration, with bounds and a study of what objectives these distributional DP methods can or cannot optimize. We describe a number of applications outlining how to use distributional DP to solve different stock-augmented return distribution optimization problems, for example maximizing conditional value-at-risk, and homeostatic regulation. To highlight the practical potential of stock-augmented return distribution optimization and distributional DP, we combine the core ideas of distributional value iteration with the deep RL agent DQN, and empirically evaluate it for solving instances of the applications discussed.

Title: Beyond the Lungs: Extending the Field of View in Chest CT with Latent Diffusion Models
Authors: Lianrui Zuo, Kaiwen Xu, Dingjie Su, Xin Yu, Aravind R. Krishnan, Yihao Liu, Shunxing Bao, Thomas Li, Kim L. Sandler, Fabien Maldonado, Bennett A. Landman
Abstract: The interconnection between the human lungs and other organs, such as the liver and kidneys, is crucial for understanding the underlying risks and effects of lung diseases and improving patient care. However, most research chest CT imaging is focused solely on the lungs due to considerations of cost and radiation dose. This restricted field of view (FOV) in the acquired images poses challenges to comprehensive analysis and hinders the ability to gain insights into the impact of lung diseases on other organs. To address this, we propose SCOPE (Spatial Coverage Optimization with Prior Encoding), a novel approach to capture the inter-organ relationships from CT images and extend the FOV of chest CT images. Our approach first trains a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode 2D axial CT slices individually, then stacks the latent representations of the VAE to form a 3D context for training a latent diffusion model. Once trained, our approach extends the FOV of CT images in the z-direction by generating new axial slices in a zero-shot manner. We evaluated our approach on the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) dataset, and results suggest that it effectively extends the FOV to include the liver and kidneys, which are not completely covered in the original NLST data acquisition. Quantitative results on a held-out whole-body dataset demonstrate that the generated slices exhibit high fidelity with acquired data, achieving an SSIM of 0.81.

Title: Robust Body Composition Analysis by Generating 3D CT Volumes from Limited 2D Slices
Authors: Lianrui Zuo, Xin Yu, Dingjie Su, Kaiwen Xu, Aravind R. Krishnan, Yihao Liu, Shunxing Bao, Fabien Maldonado, Luigi Ferrucci, Bennett A. Landman
Abstract: Body composition analysis provides valuable insights into aging, disease progression, and overall health conditions. Due to concerns of radiation exposure, two-dimensional (2D) single-slice computed tomography (CT) imaging has been used repeatedly for body composition analysis. However, this approach introduces significant spatial variability that can impact the accuracy and robustness of the analysis. To mitigate this issue and facilitate body composition analysis, this paper presents a novel method to generate 3D CT volumes from limited number of 2D slices using a latent diffusion model (LDM). Our approach first maps 2D slices into a latent representation space using a variational autoencoder. An LDM is then trained to capture the 3D context of a stack of these latent representations. To accurately interpolate intermediateslices and construct a full 3D volume, we utilize body part regression to determine the spatial location and distance between the acquired slices. Experiments on both in-house and public 3D abdominal CT datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances body composition analysis compared to traditional 2D-based analysis, with a reduced error rate from 23.3% to 15.2%.

Title: Which Sensor to Observe? Timely Tracking of a Joint Markov Source with Model Predictive Control
Authors: Ismail Cosandal, Sennur Ulukus, Nail Akar
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of remote estimation of a discrete-time joint Markov process using multiple sensors. Each sensor observes a different component of the joint Markov process, and in each time slot, the monitor obtains a partial state value by sending a pull request to one of the sensors. The monitor chooses the sequence of sensors to observe with the goal of minimizing the mean of age of incorrect information (MAoII) by using the partial state observations obtained, which have different freshness levels. For instance, a monitor may be interested in tracking the location of an object by obtaining observations from two sensors, which observe the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the object separately, in different time slots. The monitor, then, needs to decide which coordinate to observe in the next time slot given the history. In addition to this partial observability of the state of Markov process, there is an erasure channel with a fixed one-slot delay between each sensor and the monitor. First, we obtain a sufficient statistic, namely the \emph{belief}, representing the joint distribution of the age of incorrect information (AoII) and the current state of the observed process by using the history of all pull requests and observations. Then, we formulate the problem with a continuous state-space Markov decision problem (MDP), namely belief MDP. To solve the problem, we propose two model predictive control (MPC) methods, namely MPC without terminal costs (MPC-WTC) and reinforcement learning MPC (RL-MPC), that have different advantages in implementation.

Title: Treatment-aware Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Longitudinal MRI Generation and Diffuse Glioma Growth Prediction

Abstract: Diffuse gliomas are malignant brain tumors that grow widespread through the brain. The complex interactions between neoplastic cells and normal tissue, as well as the treatment-induced changes often encountered, make glioma tumor growth modeling challenging. In this paper, we present a novel end-to-end network capable of future predictions of tumor masks and multi-parametric magnetic resonance images (MRI) of how the tumor will look at any future time points for different treatment plans. Our approach is based on cutting-edge diffusion probabilistic models and deep-segmentation neural networks. We included sequential multi-parametric MRI and treatment information as conditioning inputs to guide the generative diffusion process as well as a joint segmentation process. This allows for tumor growth estimates and realistic MRI generation at any given treatment and time point. We trained the model using real-world postoperative longitudinal MRI data with glioma tumor growth trajectories represented as tumor segmentation maps over time. The model demonstrates promising performance across various tasks, including generating high-quality multi-parametric MRI with tumor masks, performing time-series tumor segmentations, and providing uncertainty estimates. Combined with the treatment-aware generated MRI, the tumor growth predictions with uncertainty estimates can provide useful information for clinical decision-making.

Title: Robust Data-Driven Kalman Filtering for Unknown Linear Systems using Maximum Likelihood Optimization
Authors: Peihu Duan, Tao Liu, Yu Xing, Karl Henrik Johansson
Abstract: This paper investigates the state estimation problem for unknown linear systems subject to both process and measurement noise. Based on a prior input-output trajectory sampled at a higher frequency and a prior state trajectory sampled at a lower frequency, we propose a novel robust data-driven Kalman filter (RDKF) that integrates model identification with state estimation for the unknown system. Specifically, the state estimation problem is formulated as a non-convex maximum likelihood optimization problem. Then, we slightly modify the optimization problem to get a problem solvable with a recursive algorithm. Based on the optimal solution to this new problem, the RDKF is designed, which can estimate the state of a given but unknown state-space model. The performance gap between the RDKF and the optimal Kalman filter based on known system matrices is quantified through a sample complexity bound. In particular, when the number of the pre-collected states tends to infinity, this gap converges to zero. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical results is illustrated by numerical simulations.

Title: Dynamic Electromagnetic Navigation
Authors: Jasan Zughaibi, Bradley J. Nelson, Michael Muehlebach
Abstract: Magnetic navigation offers wireless control over magnetic objects, which has important medical applications, such as targeted drug delivery and minimally invasive surgery. Magnetic navigation systems are categorized into systems using permanent magnets and systems based on electromagnets. Electromagnetic Navigation Systems (eMNSs) are believed to have a superior actuation bandwidth, facilitating trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection. This greatly expands the range of potential medical applications and includes even dynamic environments as encountered in cardiovascular interventions. To showcase the dynamic capabilities of eMNSs, we successfully stabilize a (non-magnetic) inverted pendulum on the tip of a magnetically driven arm. Our approach employs a model-based framework that leverages Lagrangian mechanics to capture the interaction between the mechanical dynamics and the magnetic field. Using system identification, we estimate unknown parameters, the actuation bandwidth, and characterize the system's nonlinearity. To explore the limits of electromagnetic navigation and evaluate its scalability, we characterize the electrical system dynamics and perform reference measurements on a clinical-scale eMNS, affirming that the proposed dynamic control methodologies effectively translate to larger coil configurations. A state-feedback controller stabilizes the inherently unstable pendulum, and an iterative learning control scheme enables accurate tracking of non-equilibrium trajectories. Furthermore, to understand structural limitations of our control strategy, we analyze the influence of magnetic field gradients on the motion of the system. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration to stabilize a 3D inverted pendulum through electromagnetic navigation.

Title: MD-Dose: A diffusion model based on the Mamba for radiation dose prediction
Authors: Linjie Fu, Xia Li, Xiuding Cai, Yingkai Wang, Xueyao Wang, Yali Shen, Yu Yao
Abstract: Radiation therapy is crucial in cancer treatment. Experienced experts typically iteratively generate high-quality dose distribution maps, forming the basis for excellent radiation therapy plans. Therefore, automated prediction of dose distribution maps is significant in expediting the treatment process and providing a better starting point for developing radiation therapy plans. With the remarkable results of diffusion models in predicting high-frequency regions of dose distribution maps, dose prediction methods based on diffusion models have been extensively studied. However, existing methods mainly utilize CNNs or Transformers as denoising networks. CNNs lack the capture of global receptive fields, resulting in suboptimal prediction performance. Transformers excel in global modeling but face quadratic complexity with image size, resulting in significant computational overhead. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel diffusion model, MD-Dose, based on the Mamba architecture for predicting radiation therapy dose distribution in thoracic cancer patients. In the forward process, MD-Dose adds Gaussian noise to dose distribution maps to obtain pure noise images. In the backward process, MD-Dose utilizes a noise predictor based on the Mamba to predict the noise, ultimately outputting the dose distribution maps. Furthermore, We develop a Mamba encoder to extract structural information and integrate it into the noise predictor for localizing dose regions in the planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OARs). Through extensive experiments on a dataset of 300 thoracic tumor patients, we showcase the superiority of MD-Dose in various metrics and time consumption.

Title: Serpent: Scalable and Efficient Image Restoration via Multi-scale Structured State Space Models
Authors: Mohammad Shahab Sepehri, Zalan Fabian, Mahdi Soltanolkotabi
Abstract: The landscape of computational building blocks of efficient image restoration architectures is dominated by a combination of convolutional processing and various attention mechanisms. However, convolutional filters, while efficient, are inherently local and therefore struggle with modeling long-range dependencies in images. In contrast, attention excels at capturing global interactions between arbitrary image regions, but suffers from a quadratic cost in image dimension. In this work, we propose Serpent, an efficient architecture for high-resolution image restoration that combines recent advances in state space models (SSMs) with multi-scale signal processing in its core computational block. SSMs, originally introduced for sequence modeling, can maintain a global receptive field with a favorable linear scaling in input size. We propose a novel hierarchical architecture inspired by traditional signal processing principles, that converts the input image into a collection of sequences and processes them in a multi-scale fashion. Our experimental results demonstrate that Serpent can achieve reconstruction quality on par with state-of-the-art techniques, while requiring orders of magnitude less compute (up to $150$ fold reduction in FLOPS) and a factor of up to $5\times$ less GPU memory while maintaining a compact model size. The efficiency gains achieved by Serpent are especially notable at high image resolutions.

Title: Physics-Informed Neural Networks: a Plug and Play Integration into Power System Dynamic Simulations
Authors: Ignasi Ventura Nadal, Jochen Stiasny, Spyros Chatzivasileiadis
Abstract: Time-domain simulations are crucial for ensuring power system stability and avoiding critical scenarios that could lead to blackouts. The next-generation power systems require a significant increase in the computational cost and complexity of these simulations due to additional degrees of uncertainty, non-linearity and states. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) have been shown to accelerate single-component simulations by several orders of magnitude. However, their application to current time-domain simulation solvers has been particularly challenging since the system's dynamics depend on multiple components. Using a new training formulation, this paper introduces the first natural step to integrate PINNs into multi-component time-domain simulations. We propose PINNs as an alternative to other classical numerical methods for individual components. Once trained, these neural networks approximate component dynamics more accurately for longer time steps. Formulated as an implicit and consistent method with the transient simulation workflow, PINNs speed up simulation time by significantly increasing the time steps used. For explanation clarity, we demonstrate the training, integration, and simulation framework for several combinations of PINNs and numerical solution methods using the IEEE 9-bus system, although the method applies equally well to any power system size.

Title: Distributed Charging Coordination for Electric Trucks under Limited Facilities and Travel Uncertainties
Authors: Ting Bai, Yuchao Li, Andreas A. Malikopoulos, Karl Henrik Johansson, Jonas Mårtensson
Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of charging coordination between electric trucks and charging stations. The problem arises from the tension between the trucks' nontrivial charging times and the stations' limited charging facilities. Our goal is to reduce the trucks' waiting times at the stations while minimizing individual trucks' operational costs. We propose a distributed coordination framework that relies on computation and communication between the stations and the trucks, and handles uncertainties in travel times and energy consumption. Within the framework, the stations assign a limited number of charging ports to trucks according to the first-come, first-served rule. In addition, each station constructs a waiting time forecast model based on its historical data and provides its estimated waiting times to trucks upon request. When approaching a station, a truck sends its arrival time and estimated arrival-time windows to the nearby station and the distant stations, respectively. The truck then receives the estimated waiting times from these stations in response, and updates its charging plan accordingly while accounting for travel uncertainties. We performed simulation studies for $1,000$ trucks traversing the Swedish road network for $40$ days, using realistic traffic data with travel uncertainties. The results show that our method reduces the average waiting time of the trucks by $46.1\%$ compared to offline charging plans computed by the trucks without coordination and update, and by $33.8\%$ compared to the coordination scheme assuming zero waiting times at distant stations.

Title: A Graph Signal Processing Perspective of Network Multiple Hypothesis Testing with False Discovery Rate Control
Authors: Xingchao Jian, Martin Gölz, Feng Ji, Wee Peng Tay, Abdelhak M. Zoubir
Abstract: We consider a multiple hypothesis testing problem in a sensor network over the joint spatio-temporal domain. The sensor network is modeled as a graph, with each vertex representing a sensor and a signal over time associated with each vertex. We assume a hypothesis test and an associated $p$-value for every sample point in the joint spatio-temporal domain. Our goal is to determine which points have true alternative. By parameterizing the unknown $p$-value distribution under the alternative and the prior probabilities of hypotheses being null with a bandlimited generalized graph signal, we can obtain consistent estimates for them. Consequently, we also obtain an estimate of the local false discovery rates (lfdr). We prove that by using a step-up procedure on the estimated lfdr, we can achieve asymptotic false discovery rate control at a pre-determined level. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach compared to existing methods.

Title: Certifiable Deep Learning for Reachability Using a New Lipschitz Continuous Value Function
Authors: Jingqi Li, Donggun Lee, Jaewon Lee, Kris Shengjun Dong, Somayeh Sojoudi, Claire Tomlin
Abstract: We propose a new reachability learning framework for high-dimensional nonlinear systems, focusing on reach-avoid problems. These problems require computing the reach-avoid set, which ensures that all its elements can safely reach a target set despite any disturbance within pre-specified bounds. Our framework has two main parts: offline learning of a newly designed reach-avoid value function and post-learning certification. Compared to prior works, our new value function is Lipschitz continuous and its associated Bellman operator is a contraction mapping, both of which improve the learning performance. To ensure deterministic guarantees of our learned reach-avoid set, we introduce two efficient post-learning certification methods. Both methods can be used online for real-time local certification or offline for comprehensive certification. We validate our framework in a 12-dimensional crazyflie drone racing hardware experiment and a simulated 10-dimensional highway takeover example.

Title: Dynamic Hybrid Beamforming Designs for ELAA Near-Field Communications
Authors: Mengzhen Liu, Ming Li, Rang Liu, Qian Liu
Abstract: Extremely large-scale antenna array (ELAA) is a key candidate technology for the sixth generation (6G) mobile networks. Nevertheless, using substantial numbers of antennas to transmit high-frequency signals in ELAA systems significantly exacerbates the near-field effect. Unfortunately, traditional hybrid beamforming schemes are highly vulnerable to ELAA near-field communications. To effectively mitigate severe near-field effect, we propose a novel dynamic hybrid beamforming architecture for ELAA systems, in which each antenna is either adaptively connected to one radio frequency (RF) chain for signal transmission or deactivated for power saving. For the case that instantaneous channel state information (CSI) is available during each channel coherence time, a real-time dynamic hybrid beamforming design is developed to maximize the achievable sum rate under the constraints of the constant modulus of phase-shifters (PSs), non-overlapping dynamic connection network and total transmit power. When instantaneous CSI cannot be easily obtained in real-time, we propose a two-timescale dynamic hybrid beamforming design, which optimizes analog beamformer in long-timescale and digital beamformer in short-timescale, with the goal of maximizing ergodic sum-rate under the same constraints. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed dynamic hybrid beamforming architecture and the effectiveness of the developed algorithms for ELAA near-field communications.

Title: Semi-intrusive audio evaluation: Casting non-intrusive assessment as a multi-modal text prediction task
Authors: Jozef Coldenhoff, Milos Cernak
Abstract: Human perception has the unique ability to focus on specific events in a mixture of signals--a challenging task for existing non-intrusive assessment methods. In this work, we introduce semi-intrusive assessment that emulates human attention by framing audio assessment as a text-prediction task with audio-text inputs. To this end, we extend the multi-modal PENGI model through instruction fine-tuning for MOS and SNR estimation. For MOS, our approach achieves absolute Pearson correlation gains of 0.06 and 0.20 over the re-trained MOSRA model and the pre-trained PAM model, respectively. We further propose a novel SNR estimator that can focus on a specific audio source in a mixture, outperforming a random baseline and the fixed-prompt counterpart. Our findings suggest that semi-intrusive assessment can effectively capture human-like selective listening capabilities. Samples are available at this https URL.

Title: Synchronization for Multiuser Uplink OTFS
Authors: Mohsen Bayat, Sanoopkumar P.S., Arman Farhang
Abstract: In this paper, we propose time and frequency synchronization techniques for the uplink of multiuser orthogonal time frequency space (MU-OTFS) in high-mobility scenarios. We introduce a spectrally efficient and practical pilot pattern where each user utilizes a pilot with a cyclic prefix (PCP) within a shared pilot region on the delay-Doppler plane. At the receiver, a bank of filters is deployed to separate the users' signals and accurately estimate their timing offsets (TOs) and carrier frequency offsets (CFOs). Our technique employs a threshold-based approach that provides precise TO estimates. Our proposed CFO estimation technique reduces the multi-dimensional maximum likelihood (ML) search problem into multiple one-dimensional search problems. Furthermore, we apply the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind basis expansion model (CPF-BEM) to effectively handle the time-variations of the channel in obtaining the CFO estimates for all the users. Finally, we numerically investigate the error performance of our proposed synchronization technique in high mobility scenarios for the MU-OTFS uplink. Our simulation results confirm the efficacy of the proposed technique in estimating the TOs and CFOs which also leads to an improved channel estimation performance.

Title: Flexibility Options: A Proposed Product for Managing Imbalance Risk
Authors: Elina Spyrou, Qiwei Zhang, Robin B. Hytowitz, Ben F. Hobbs, Siddharth Tyagi, Mengmeng Cai, Michael Blonsky
Abstract: The presence of variable renewable energy resources with uncertain outputs in day-ahead electricity markets results in additional balancing needs in real-time. Addressing those needs cost-effectively and reliably within a competitive market with unbundled products is challenging as both the demand for and the availability of flexibility depends on day-ahead energy schedules. Existing approaches for reserve procurement usually rely either on oversimplified demand curves that do not consider how system conditions that particular day affect the value of flexibility, or on bilateral trading of hedging instruments that are not co-optimized with day-ahead schedules. This article proposes a new product, `Flexibility Options', to address these two limitations. The demand for this product is endogenously determined in the day-ahead market and it is met cost-effectively by considering real-time supply curves for product providers, which are co-optimized with the energy supply. As we illustrate with numerical examples and mathematical analysis, the product addresses the hedging needs of participants with imbalances cost-effectively, provides a less intermittent revenue stream for participants with flexible outputs, promotes value-driven pricing of flexibility, and ensures that the system operator is revenue-neutral. This article provides a comprehensive design that can be further tested and applied in large-scale systems.

Title: Koopman-based control of nonlinear systems with closed-loop guarantees
Authors: Robin Strässer, Julian Berberich, Manuel Schaller, Karl Worthmann, Frank Allgöwer
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a tutorial overview and an extension of a recently developed framework for data-driven control of unknown nonlinear systems with rigorous closed-loop guarantees. The proposed approach relies on the Koopman operator representation of the nonlinear system, for which a bilinear surrogate model is estimated based on data. In contrast to existing Koopman-based estimation procedures, we state guaranteed bounds on the approximation error using the stability- and certificate-oriented extended dynamic mode decomposition (SafEDMD) framework. The resulting surrogate model and the uncertainty bounds allow us to design controllers via robust control theory and sum-of-squares optimization, guaranteeing desirable properties for the closed-loop system. We present results on stabilization both in discrete and continuous time, and we derive a method for controller design with performance objectives. The benefits of the presented framework over established approaches are demonstrated with a numerical example.

Title: Steady-State Initialization of Object-Oriented Advanced Thermal Power Generation System Models with Application to the Case of the SOS-CO2 Cycle
Authors: Matteo Luigi De Pascali, Francesco Casella
Abstract: The forthcoming energy transition calls for a new generation of thermal power generation systems with low- or zero-emission and highly flexible operation. Dynamic modelling and simulation is a key enabling factor in this field, as controlling such plants is a difficult task for which there is no previous experience and very short design times are expected. The steady-state initialization of those dynamic models is an essential step in the design process, but is unfortunately a difficult task which involves the numerical solution of large systems of nonlinear equations with iterative Newton methods, which is often prone to numerical failures. In this work, several strategies and methodologies are discussed to successfully achieve steady-state initialization of first-principles equation-based, object-oriented models of advanced thermal power generation systems. These are presented in the context of the Modelica modelling language, but could be applied to other equation-based, object-oriented modelling and simulation environments. Finally, the successful application of such strategies and methodologies to the SOS-CO2 advanced power generation system is presented.

Title: Capacity Maximization for MIMO Channels Assisted by Beyond-Diagonal RIS
Authors: Emil Björnson, Özlem Tuğfe Demir
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can improve the capacity of wireless communication links by passively beamforming the impinging signals in desired directions. This feature has been demonstrated both analytically and experimentally for conventional RISs, consisting of independently reflecting elements. To further enhance reconfigurability, a new architecture called beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) has been proposed. It allows for controllable signal flows between RIS elements, resulting in a non-diagonal reflection matrix, unlike the conventional RIS architecture. Previous studies on BD-RIS-assisted communications have predominantly considered single-antenna transmitters/receivers. One recent work provides an iterative capacity-improving algorithm for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) setups but without providing geometrical insights. In this paper, we derive the first closed-form capacity-maximizing BD-RIS reflection matrix for a MIMO channel. We describe how this solution pairs together propagation paths, how it behaves when the signal-to-noise ratio is high, and what capacity is achievable with ideal semi-unitary channel matrices. The analytical results are corroborated numerically.

Title: Boosting Diffusion Guidance via Learning Degradation-Aware Models for Blind Super Resolution
Authors: Shao-Hao Lu, Ren Wang, Ching-Chun Huang, Wei-Chen Chiu
Abstract: Recently, diffusion-based blind super-resolution (SR) methods have shown great ability to generate high-resolution images with abundant high-frequency detail, but the detail is often achieved at the expense of fidelity. Meanwhile, another line of research focusing on rectifying the reverse process of diffusion models (i.e., diffusion guidance), has demonstrated the power to generate high-fidelity results for non-blind SR. However, these methods rely on known degradation kernels, making them difficult to apply to blind SR. To address these issues, we present DADiff in this paper. DADiff incorporates degradation-aware models into the diffusion guidance framework, eliminating the need to know degradation kernels. Additionally, we propose two novel techniques -- input perturbation and guidance scalar -- to further improve our performance. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed method has superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on blind SR benchmarks.

Title: OpenEarthMap-SAR: A Benchmark Synthetic Aperture Radar Dataset for Global High-Resolution Land Cover Mapping
Authors: Junshi Xia, Hongruixuan Chen, Clifford Broni-Bediako, Yimin Wei, Jian Song, Naoto Yokoya
Abstract: High-resolution land cover mapping plays a crucial role in addressing a wide range of global challenges, including urban planning, environmental monitoring, disaster response, and sustainable development. However, creating accurate, large-scale land cover datasets remains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexities of geospatial data, such as diverse terrain, varying sensor modalities, and atmospheric conditions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, with its ability to penetrate clouds and capture data in all-weather, day-and-night conditions, offers unique advantages for land cover mapping. Despite these strengths, the lack of benchmark datasets tailored for SAR imagery has limited the development of robust models specifically designed for this data modality. To bridge this gap and facilitate advancements in SAR-based geospatial analysis, we introduce OpenEarthMap-SAR, a benchmark SAR dataset, for global high-resolution land cover mapping. OpenEarthMap-SAR consists of 1.5 million segments of 5033 aerial and satellite images with the size of 1024$\times$1024 pixels, covering 35 regions from Japan, France, and the USA, with partially manually annotated and fully pseudo 8-class land cover labels at a ground sampling distance of 0.15--0.5 m. We evaluated the performance of state-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation and present challenging problem settings suitable for further technical development. The dataset also serves the official dataset for IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest Track I. The dataset has been made publicly available at this https URL.

Title: SE(3)-Based Trajectory Optimization and Target Tracking in UAV-Enabled ISAC Systems
Authors: Dongxiao Xu, Xinyang Li, Vlad C. Andrei, Moritz Wiese, Ullrich J. Moenich, Holger Boche
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to enhance sensing capabilities in UAV-enabled MIMO-OFDM ISAC systems by leveraging UAV mobility as a mono-static radar. By integrating uniform planar arrays (UPAs) and modeling the UAV dynamics in $SE(3)$, we address key challenges such as 3D space sensing and trajectory design. We propose a target tracking scheme using extended Kalman filtering (EKF) in $SE(3)$, along with trajectory optimization based on the conditional Posterior Cramer-Rao bound (CPCRB). Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory design in enhancing performance of target tracking and physical parameter estimation in UAV-enabled MIMO-OFDM ISAC systems.

Title: Detecting Structural Shifts in Multivariate Hawkes Processes with Fr\'echet Statistics
Authors: Rui Luo, Vikram Krishnamurthy
Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach for change point detection in multivariate Hawkes processes using Fréchet statistic of a network. The method splits the point process into overlapping windows, estimates kernel matrices in each window, and reconstructs the signed Laplacians by treating the kernel matrices as the adjacency matrices of the causal network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on both simulated and cryptocurrency datasets. Our results show that our method is capable of accurately detecting and characterizing changes in the causal structure of multivariate Hawkes processes, and may have potential applications in fields such as finance and neuroscience. The proposed method is an extension of previous work on Fréchet statistics in point process settings and represents an important contribution to the field of change point detection in multivariate point processes.

Title: On Optimal MMSE Channel Estimation for One-Bit Quantized MIMO Systems
Authors: Minhua Ding, Italo Atzeni, Antti Tölli, A. Lee Swindlehurst
Abstract: This paper focuses on the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) channel estimator for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with one-bit quantization at the receiver side. Despite its optimality and significance in estimation theory, the MMSE channel estimator has not been fully investigated in this context due to its general non-linearity and computational complexity. Instead, the typically suboptimal Bussgang linear MMSE (BLMMSE) estimator has been widely adopted. In this work, we develop a new framework to compute the MMSE channel estimator that hinges on computation of the orthant probability of the multivariate normal distribution. Based on this framework, we determine a necessary and sufficient condition for the BLMMSE channel estimator to be optimal and equivalent to the MMSE estimator. Under the assumption of specific channel correlation or pilot symbols, we further utilize the framework to derive analytical expressions for the MMSE channel estimator that are particularly convenient for computation when certain system dimensions become large, thereby enabling a comparison between the BLMMSE and MMSE channel estimators in these cases.

Title: Single-shot volumetric fluorescence imaging with neural fields
Authors: Oumeng Zhang, Haowen Zhou, Brandon Y. Feng, Elin M. Larsson, Reinaldo E. Alcalde, Siyuan Yin, Catherine Deng, Changhuei Yang
Abstract: Single-shot volumetric fluorescence (SVF) imaging offers a significant advantage over traditional imaging methods that require scanning across multiple axial planes as it can capture biological processes with high temporal resolution. The key challenges in SVF imaging include requiring sparsity constraints, eliminating depth ambiguity in the reconstruction, and maintaining high resolution across a large field of view. In this paper, we introduce the QuadraPol point spread function (PSF) combined with neural fields, a novel approach for SVF imaging. This method utilizes a custom polarizer at the back focal plane and a polarization camera to detect fluorescence, effectively encoding the 3D scene within a compact PSF without depth ambiguity. Additionally, we propose a reconstruction algorithm based on the neural fields technique that provides improved reconstruction quality compared to classical deconvolution methods. QuadraPol PSF, combined with neural fields, significantly reduces the acquisition time of a conventional fluorescence microscope by approximately 20 times and captures a 100 mm$^3$ cubic volume in one shot. We validate the effectiveness of both our hardware and algorithm through all-in-focus imaging of bacterial colonies on sand surfaces and visualization of plant root morphology. Our approach offers a powerful tool for advancing biological research and ecological studies.

Title: An Embedding is Worth a Thousand Noisy Labels
Authors: Francesco Di Salvo, Sebastian Doerrich, Ines Rieger, Christian Ledig
Abstract: The performance of deep neural networks scales with dataset size and label quality, rendering the efficient mitigation of low-quality data annotations crucial for building robust and cost-effective systems. Existing strategies to address label noise exhibit severe limitations due to computational complexity and application dependency. In this work, we propose WANN, a Weighted Adaptive Nearest Neighbor approach that builds on self-supervised feature representations obtained from foundation models. To guide the weighted voting scheme, we introduce a reliability score, which measures the likelihood of a data label being correct. WANN outperforms reference methods, including a linear layer trained with robust loss functions, on diverse datasets of varying size and under various noise types and severities. WANN also exhibits superior generalization on imbalanced data compared to both Adaptive-NNs (ANN) and fixed k-NNs. Furthermore, the proposed weighting scheme enhances supervised dimensionality reduction under noisy labels. This yields a significant boost in classification performance with 10x and 100x smaller image embeddings, minimizing latency and storage requirements. Our approach, emphasizing efficiency and explainability, emerges as a simple, robust solution to overcome inherent limitations of deep neural network training.

Title: GALD-SE: Guided Anisotropic Lightweight Diffusion for Efficient Speech Enhancement
Authors: Chengzhong Wang, Jianjun Gu, Dingding Yao, Junfeng Li, Yonghong Yan
Abstract: Speech enhancement is designed to enhance the intelligibility and quality of speech across diverse noise conditions. Recently, diffusion model has gained lots of attention in speech enhancement area, achieving competitive results. Current diffusion-based methods blur the signal with isotropic Gaussian noise and recover clean speech from the prior. However, these methods often suffer from a substantial computational burden. We argue that the computational inefficiency partially stems from the oversight that speech enhancement is not purely a generative task; it primarily involves noise reduction and completion of missing information, while the clean clues in the original mixture do not need to be regenerated. In this paper, we propose a method that introduces noise with anisotropic guidance during the diffusion process, allowing the neural network to preserve clean clues within noisy recordings. This approach substantially reduces computational complexity while exhibiting robustness against various forms of noise and speech distortion. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results with only approximately 4.5 million parameters, a number significantly lower than that required by other diffusion methods. This effectively narrows the model size disparity between diffusion-based and predictive speech enhancement approaches. Additionally, the proposed method performs well in very noisy scenarios, demonstrating its potential for applications in highly challenging environments.

Title: Energy Efficient Transmission Parameters Selection Method Using Reinforcement Learning in Distributed LoRa Networks
Authors: Ryotai Airiyoshi, Mikio Hasegawa, Tomoaki Ohtsuki, Aohan Li
Abstract: With the increase in demand for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, the number of IoT devices has drastically grown, making spectrum resources seriously insufficient. Transmission collisions and retransmissions increase power consumption. Therefore, even in long-range (LoRa) networks, selecting appropriate transmission parameters, such as channel and transmission power, is essential to improve energy efficiency. However, due to the limited computational ability and memory, traditional transmission parameter selection methods for LoRa networks are challenging to implement on LoRa devices. To solve this problem, a distributed reinforcement learning-based channel and transmission power selection method is proposed, which can be implemented on the LoRa devices to improve energy efficiency in this paper. Specifically, the channel and transmission power selection problem in LoRa networks is first mapped to the multi-armed-bandit (MAB) problem. Then, an MAB-based method is introduced to solve the formulated transmission parameter selection problem based on the acknowledgment (ACK) packet and the power consumption for data transmission of the LoRa device. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by the constructed actual LoRa network. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs better than fixed assignment, adaptive data rate low-complexity (ADR-Lite), and $\epsilon$-greedy-based methods in terms of both transmission success rate and energy efficiency.

Title: Performance evaluation of SLAM-ASR: The Good, the Bad, the Ugly, and the Way Forward
Authors: Shashi Kumar, Iuliia Thorbecke, Sergio Burdisso, Esaú Villatoro-Tello, Manjunath K E, Kadri Hacioğlu, Pradeep Rangappa, Petr Motlicek, Aravind Ganapathiraju, Andreas Stolcke
Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that training a linear connector between speech foundation encoders and large language models (LLMs) enables this architecture to achieve strong ASR capabilities. Despite the impressive results, it remains unclear whether these simple approaches are robust enough across different scenarios and speech conditions, such as domain shifts and speech perturbations. In this paper, we address these questions by conducting various ablation experiments using a recent and widely adopted approach called SLAM-ASR. We present novel empirical findings that offer insights on how to effectively utilize the SLAM-ASR architecture across a wide range of settings. Our main findings indicate that SLAM-ASR exhibits poor performance in cross-domain evaluation settings. Additionally, speech perturbations on in-domain data, such as changes in speech rate or additive noise, can significantly degrade performance. Our findings offer critical insights for fine-tuning and configuring robust LLM-based ASR models, tailored to different data characteristics and computational resources.

Title: Long-Form Text-to-Music Generation with Adaptive Prompts: A Case of Study in Tabletop Role-Playing Games Soundtracks
Authors: Felipe Marra, Lucas N. Ferreira
Abstract: This paper investigates the capabilities of text-to-audio music generation models in producing long-form music with prompts that change over time, focusing on soundtrack generation for Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TRPGs). We introduce Babel Bardo, a system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform speech transcriptions into music descriptions for controlling a text-to-music model. Four versions of Babel Bardo were compared in two TRPG campaigns: a baseline using direct speech transcriptions, and three LLM-based versions with varying approaches to music description generation. Evaluations considered audio quality, story alignment, and transition smoothness. Results indicate that detailed music descriptions improve audio quality while maintaining consistency across consecutive descriptions enhances story alignment and transition smoothness.

Title: Towards Interpretable Radiology Report Generation via Concept Bottlenecks using a Multi-Agentic RAG
Authors: Hasan Md Tusfiqur Alam, Devansh Srivastav, Md Abdul Kadir, Daniel Sonntag
Abstract: Deep learning has advanced medical image classification, but interpretability challenges hinder its clinical adoption. This study enhances interpretability in Chest X-ray (CXR) classification by using concept bottleneck models (CBMs) and a multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for report generation. By modeling relationships between visual features and clinical concepts, we create interpretable concept vectors that guide a multi-agent RAG system to generate radiology reports, enhancing clinical relevance, explainability, and transparency. Evaluation of the generated reports using an LLM-as-a-judge confirmed the interpretability and clinical utility of our model's outputs. On the COVID-QU dataset, our model achieved 81% classification accuracy and demonstrated robust report generation performance, with five key metrics ranging between 84% and 90%. This interpretable multi-agent framework bridges the gap between high-performance AI and the explainability required for reliable AI-driven CXR analysis in clinical settings.

Title: Distributionally Robust Joint Chance-Constrained Optimal Power Flow using Relative Entropy
Authors: Eli Brock, Haixiang Zhang, Javad Lavaei, Somayeh Sojoudi
Abstract: Designing robust algorithms for the optimal power flow (OPF) problem is critical for the control of large-scale power systems under uncertainty. The chance-constrained OPF (CCOPF) problem provides a natural formulation of the trade-off between the operating cost and the constraint satisfaction rate. In this work, we propose a new data-driven algorithm for the CCOPF problem, based on distributionally robust optimization (DRO). \revise{We show that the proposed reformulation of the distributionally robust chance constraints is exact, whereas other approaches in the CCOPF literature rely on conservative approximations. We establish out-of-sample robustness guarantees for the distributionally robust solution and prove that the solution is the most efficient among all approaches enjoying the same guarantees.} We apply the proposed algorithm to the the CCOPF problem and compare the performance of our approach with existing methods using simulations on IEEE benchmark power systems.
